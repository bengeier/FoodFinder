{"text":"Went to Poros for dinner on a Friday night.  We waited an hour and a half for our food after ordering and it was cool when we got it.  The service was pretty poor, the prices above average and the food just OK."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice.  The location is great.  Service is good.  Food is good.  Not great, but good.  The olives are mixed and seasoned so they are not 'truly Greek' because of the herb addition.  The feta was nice - not over-powering.  It's better with the bread, not the pitta bread.  The lamb frisse was quite good, shrimp were good with a different sauce, and the cauliflower was very good.  The lemon pound cake and the baklava icre - cream...could easily enjoy only those deserts with coffee and leave happy.  The outside seating with the heaters will be a nice addition to Market Square.  Something new for Pittsburgh.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Poros was a very nice open air restaurant.  Fresh fish was very nice, with Salmon and Chilean Sea bass cooked nicely.  Spanakopita was excellent, but sadly a small portion of two pieces for the price.  Think Tapas.  Service was Excellent, and we were there in early Sunday evening when business was lite.  We would definitely return for an encore dinner."}
{"text":"The decor is very nice, and the staff is nice and attentive. $4 an oyster, $5 a shrimp? LOL  The hummus tasted.. not great. The salad was good, but nothing special (blood orange salad). The raw bar sampler was okay, but the ceviche was not fresh and made my boyfriend want to leave after tasting ... yikes.. I was embarrassed I chose to go there. There are lots of awesome restaurants downtown and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Had a reservation on a Saturday night and wasn't seated until almost 40 minutes after our reservation time.  Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, but it took way too long for our meals to arrive. The food was good, but not great. Won't be back until they can work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Dined there on a Saturday night.  The food was good, hardly exceptional given the price.  Yes the space is very cool.  Service as horrible - they forgot to get our wine order, brought food and drinks meant for another table and told us they were too busy to do the Chef's Dinner listed on the menu.  Overall pleasant but have had much better food elsewhere and for the service and food it is too expensive!!!"}
{"text":"I had a salad that was excellent. The salad with cucumber, tomato and feta. Also had the sea bass and it was below room temperature and not cooked long enough. The rice was also cold and there wasn't very much of it. Also had a martini and there was barely anything in the glass.   It was an adult night out for me and my wife and we were put in a back room with a family with small children. Unbelievable and unacceptable. Will never come back to this restaurant.  This is not a place for small children."}
{"text":"It was dreadful.  If I could give it a zero minus, I would.  The menu is not Greek and they do not know how to prepare and serve Greek food."}
{"text":"I love Greek food so I was very excited there's a new Greek/Mediterranean restaurant in pgh(which has very few good ones).  The service is great. The food... is ok. The taste/quality does not match the price. I ordered a whole Latvia fish which was very good. My boyfriend ordered a salmon fillet which he said was quite bland. We shared a large $18 salad and chicken shawarma sliders and baba ganoush. Baba ganoush was the size of an ashtray, but decent. I thought the large salad that was brought out was the small. It was indeed the large... It's really small. I'm 5\"1, the large salad could fit inside my hands. Definitely not enough to share and I'm not sure it would've even fed myself full at $18. I don't mind expensive restaurants if the quality matched the price. I love Nola, meat & potatoes, and seviche... But poro's food quality does not match the price.  I will come back for the whole fish if I get the mood for it, but I would not order anything else. Also, I wanted to package up a sauce to go with my leftover fish, but they did not have any sauce container, understandable for a very new restaurant.  Hopefully their lunch menu makes more sense than the dinner menu."}
{"text":"So I went there two nights in a row this week. The first time I had the sea bass and wilted salad. The sea bass was pretty good, but the wilted salad was not.    On the second trip, I went with a group of friends. We made the mistake of ordering the chef sampler. The chef sampler was exceptional. However, the server continued to place appetizer orders without asking our party if we wanted additional food. At one point, I requested that the server stop bringing items to the table and he proceeded to bring three more appetizers."}
{"text":"We *love* Greek food and were thrilled to try Poros!  Reserved a lunch table through Open Table app...no issues upon arrival and was seated promptly.  Server was efficient and friendly, no concerns there.  Menu looked very good and I decided on the 3 course Prix Fixe (horiatiki salad, pastisio and baklava ice cream).    The salad was excellent, though smaller than I'd have liked.  I could overlook that, though, given that it was exactly like the salads I had in Naxos, Greece.  The feta was creamy, the tomatoes, cukes and peppers were at room temp, nice oregano and oil throughout.  One kalamata olive though.  :  (      Pastisio is my favorite Greek dish...so comforting and warm.  Poros' pastisio is lamb based, and I was surprised to see pieces of lamb instead of the regular ground meat.  From there, it went a bit downhill.  There was one scant later of tube pasta atop the lamb and the sliced tomatoes (also a Poros twist), and that was topped by a further scant later of bechamel (touted as allspice bechamel on the menu).  The bechamel and pasta had solidified into one firm, thin later devoid of any flavor at all.  HUGE disappointment.  Bechamel should be lovely and fragrant and creamy...and far more than a 1/4\" layer.  Being a traditional comfort food, I can't see how you can leave out the pasta, either.  The lamb was cooked excellently - no fat, no gristle, very tender...but, It wasn't seasoned at all.  Much room for improvement in this dish.  With lamb of that quality, it could be a standout.  The star of the show was the baklava ice cream.  Cinnamon based with pieces of honeyed phyllo throughout.  Topped with what I can only describe as a baklava crisp, it was absolutely scrumptious.  Overall, this place has potential.  Gorgeous space, a seemingly eager staff and a menu that shouldn't be too difficult to master, I really hope they fine tune their recipes in the very near future.  I'd head back in a month to give it another shot!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big eater and am FAR from cheap, but seriously? The serving sizes are laughable. I mean \"immediately leave and order a pizza\" laughable. The prices for the quality and amount of food is RIDICULOUS. I would go ANYWHERE else downtown... even fast food. I have no idea how they get any business."}
{"text":"Mediocre food for $39 entrees. This place has potential, nice environment and location but the food, wine selection  and service is average and not worth the high price."}
{"text":"My favorite aspect of this restraunt is the variety of uncommon seafood options- Dover Sole, Chilean Seabass, etc.   The first thing you notice when you walk in is the decor- it compliments the menu nicely."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken shawarma; it was more akin to duck, the meat - exceedingly dark and tasted like wild game bird even through the heavy marinade, there were chunks of bone and  gristle throughout, beer was overpriced and the glasses are impractical, on the bright side the FOH staff are diverse and well trained and beautiful atmosphere. Great example of how high quality food doesn't always translate into an enjoyable meal, my dogs will get the leftover chicken once I remove all the bones and gristle."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh seafood and beautiful decoration. You enter and see the fridge full of fresh fish on ice. By the time we were leaving the restaurant, the fridge was almost empty. I had Ahi tuna and the octopus appetizer and they were both great. The size of dishes are on the small side. The cocktail selection was not that diverse tho."}
{"text":"Where to start? Well, they had the table ready for my group of 7 so that was good. Now on to the bad.  We went for the three course pre fix meal for lent. When I say we, I mean a group of 7 young professionals on their lunch break. I tell who ever is reading this because of my first complaint.   Complaint number 1! They treated us like kids. I noticed multiple tables get up and leave after eating while we were still waiting for our food. We felt like we were being skipped because we were younger (Mid to late 20s). The waitress said when we got there, the meals would be out in 10-15 minutes, I specifically asked because one of my co-workers needed us to order her food due to a time constraint. We ended up waiting 48 minutes to get our food.   Complaint number 2! The food was terrible. The steak my friends had on their salads was extremely under cooked. My chicken bacon sandwich was supposed to have a spicy sauce on it and there wasn't a hint of spicy.   Complaint number 3! Even the food we order for my friend who had a time constraint took forever to come out.   I recommend never going here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequently entertain clients over dinner. We were anxious to try the newest restaurant on Market Square. Poros is newly opened. The decor is beautiful!  There was standing room only in the bar area. We placed drink orders and were a little disappointed by the \"short\" pours.   Our table was ready, on time for our 6:45 reservation.  The menu is unique, both fish and meat dishes are priced by the number of ounces you order. The menu offers three different preparations to choose from.  Each of our party ordered different items for appetizer, salad and entree.  I had the dandelion, spinach, pine nut...salad. It was light and delicious.  My main course was the Dover sole, the whole fish arrived, bones and all. Our server Raj graciously took it back to the kitchen to have the fish deboned. The resulting dish was great.   Our guests confided after dinner that their dishes were a little disappointing in flavor and price.  We all agreed the best part of our evening was our server Raj. He was fun, very professional, knowledgable with the menu and food preparations. His service was exceptionally great!  Should we return, we would definitely request Raj."}
{"text":"Okay, 3 was generous coming from 2 people who have dined on a Greek Island on the Medeteranian.  My Greek wife and I would rate Poros a 2 and a half.  The grilled octopus appetizer was more vegetable than octopus.  We both ordered the whole fish entrée in the Lavraki and Dorade and found the fish itself to be well prepared.  However, the side sauces (Garlic Skordalia and the Citronette) to overpower the taste of the fish.  The greens (wilted horta) were made to taste more bitter by warming them.  Also, Greeks and Middle Eastern folk all eat pita if not bread with their meal yet none were offered.  The baklava ice cream was a nice yet overly complicated version of a great treat you can find at any Greek festival.  Overall, it was a nice dining experience but not the authentic Greek or Middle Eastern meal my dear wife and I were anticipating. The ambiance is nicer than than meal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great, it has a very modern feel but is a little upscale- I felt slightly underdressed in jeans.  Our server was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu.  Basically it consists of many different small plates, called mezze, and an extensive fish market to order from.    My group decided to order a number of different small plates to share instead of ordering any of the seafood entrees.  My favorite by far was the fig and duck confit baklava- we ended up ordering a second one because it was so good!  The seafood mezze were also delicious, they made me wish I had saved room for an actual entree. The other mezze were good, but nothing too spectacular.  Just from the small plates we had, I think the seafood is where this restaurant really shines.   I would definitely come back here again, but I think next time I will opt for the fish market instead of many small plates.  Also, it looked like the bar area was very busy and fun, I think it would be worth stopping by for a few drinks."}
{"text":"Just okay...not bad but there are so many other options around the city with great food. Disappointing hummus and baba ganoush, crab cakes were definitely a let down. The octopus appetizer and the atmosphere were great!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off and say I was very excited to come here for dinner considering I live downtown & I am always looking for new spots.   ***Note: this is their second day open*** (We were expecting them to be on their A game...)  The service was inexperienced. The menu was very confusing and our 1 of 2 servers did not explain the menu. Also, we wanted to order a bottle of wine and our server wasn't comfortable going over the wine menu so she mentioned another employee would come over to explain the wine list with us... 20 starving minutes later he still did not show up. Our 2nd server came over and mentioned her favorite two wines.. We just picked a random one they were no help.   We wanted to order salmon & the server quoted: \"I think I overheard that we might be low on salmon, if so what's your backup?\" Lol....   The food was mediocre and not worth the price.  Half an hour later we learned there was no salmon only because I was served seabass.. They offered us a free desert..  To top it all off a bus boy spilled drinks all over the floor and stained my date's leather loafers.   We really tried to like this place but there was disappointment after disappointment.. We will not be back for food..   The atmosphere is very nice but that's the only credit I give this place."}
{"text":"Dined here Saturday (5-21) and the experience was exceptional!  Becca, our server had prolific knowlege of the menu and showed an unusual enthusiasm describing the menu items and explaining how the mezze system works.  Reservations were seemless and my date and i were seated immediately.    The meal was absolutely delicious!! After a small appitizer of the most flavorful hummus with pita bread, she decided on the dorade fish (which was actually two filets with crabmeat stuffed inside like a sandwich) over tabouli and asparagus.  She commented how perfectly it was cooked and how complex the pairing tasted (might have been the pitcher of sangria talking) but I had a similar experience with my lamb shank and cinnimon infused acorn squash and greens. The lamb seemed to melt right off the bone! It was expertly cooked and bursting with flavor!  It was truly a heavenly experience. Utterly delicious and quite inexpensive considering this was a 5 star meal.  The decor is astounding, I'm a big fan of blue so the mixture of blues and silver is almost reminiscent of dining with royalty. Very classy and well decorated.  My date complimented the entire experience at Poros and made sure to tell me \"if you ever want another date again, please make sure to call me!\"    Definitely want to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Service was good.  Choices were wide and varied.  But pricing was rather high compared to the average quality.  Just wasn't wowed by the taste."}
{"text":"Yesterday my wife and two associates had lunch together and our server was Cori - who was a delight!  We will come back and ask for her.  Despite the usual struggles of a new restaurant, Cori made it an enjoyable experience aided by scrumptious plates of food.   The soup du jour with mussels and lamb stopped the show - so we all ordered it!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and our server was great. The restaurant's interior is beautiful and I would rate Poros five stars but unfortunately the manager on duty seemed very unprofessional. He was scolding what seemed to be an off duty worker or friend out in the open and in front of his guests. It was uncomfortable and unfitting for such an elegant restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to a birthday dinner tonight... Was looking forward to trying a new restaurant.  Food=2, drinks=2, service=3, decor =2... All out of five. How does hummus not have any flavor? Small plates are SMALL and not worth $12. Borek was no where near a Turkish borek.  My uncle is from Turkey and I've had my fair share of borek.  The one I had tonight is not even a close interpretation of a borek and had no flavor. Service was surprisingly good for a newer restaurant. The decor was ok and the lighting was horrible. We were in the private dining area and it reminded me of the lighting in a Pittsburgh banquet hall. Better choices out there..."}
{"text":"Staff was rude  and even though we were the only ones there, we had to wait a long time for everything. The food is great  but overprice  you get very little."}
{"text":"Upscale, relaxed ambience with outdoor terrace  seating overlooking Market Square. Enjoyed 3 appetizers rather than an entree, for variety, and it was perfect. The baba ghanoush, sea bass and a spinach, cheese, filo dish were all tasty.  And they've got a nice wine list including Greek, Turkish, etc to choose from. Service was excellent and I didn't wait long for my dishes. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful inside. We chose to sit outside on their equally comfortable covered terrace. There were 5 in our party and we all enjoyed our meals. The Seafood Tagine, with Sea Bass, shrimp and scallops was a big hit, as were the crab cakes. Our waiter Ryan is very attentive, knew his food and answered any questions. Cannot think of a single flaw."}
{"text":"Had dinner with another couple over a month ago. Both my husband and I had ill affects from the highly spicy food. Reported this privately on Open Table. After a lot of phone tag spoke with manager Alan who apologized and offered advice about ordering less spicy items and a promise to send a gift card to give Poros another try. After 4 1/2 weeks and another phone call we have never received the gift certificate. Now I am publicly posting my poor experience with the food and treatment by management. Idol promise. Very bad business tactics."}
{"text":"We had a group of eight having dinner before a show.   We were on time (6:15) and seated promptly.   Great front of house, took our coats, made us feel very welcome.    GREAT bar and cocktails.   Highly recommend the bar.  Appetizer of octopus was really nice.    Beet salad was fantastic.     Main Entree's.......ALL 8 were either luke warm or cold.    I ordered the Branzino and it was not only cold to the touch but it was raw.   I sent it back and it came back in 5 minutes still raw.   I could not eat it.   This is a flaky white fish of great taste but it was so raw it was rubbery and i had to cut it with a knife.    I couldn't eat it and I was already delayed in eating.  The rice that accompanied the dish was really good tho.    SO don't go for dinner and if you do leave plenty of time to have your meal either heated up or actually cooked.     I won't be going back for dinner but the cocktails were spectacular!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, atmosphere and service!  Hosted my father's 85th birthday dinner here and it was a wonderful experience. The food was delicious, from the appetizers (octopus, lamb hearts, assorted dips, and the amazing ouzo cured salmon) to the mains (horiatiki salata, scallops, stuffed branzino, and the lamb shank) to the deserts. And both the host and our waitress were very attentive, ensuring we had a great experience. We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. The patio and atmosphere is really what peaked our interest. Boy, did it not disappoint. They were on their brunch menu and our server Jordan was fabulous. Every suggestion he had was perfect. He was very personable and energetic. He was always checking on us, but never in an overbearing way. I would highly recommend. If the food wasn't enough to bring us back. The waitstaff most definitely will. Thanks for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Wow another great addition to Market Square! Beautiful space with attentive wait staff and s great menu! Prices are reasonable and the food was superb!"}
{"text":"This was the second time we had dinner here, I'm glad we returned. The first time, we weren't impressed with the food, service, or price.  Over a year ago, and the place was new.  It is much improved!  I am so happy we tried it again!  We had oysters on the half shell to start.  Meh.  Small, but tasty, but $22 for a half dozen?   But, then we had whole snapper a la plancha that was one of the best we ever had, and we've had it many places, from Pittsburgh to Costa Rica.  Highly recommend.  But, again, pricey.  Not that it wasn't plenty.  The fish is fresh, and weighed in at 1.5 lbs each total weight.  You pay by the pound. The snapper was $28 per lb, so our fish was around $40 per.  Asparagus side dish was $7. Wine selection is very good, ranging from $8 to $22 a glass.  Our friend had the Lavraki filet.  That fish was priced at $56 per lb.  She said it was excellent.  We had only an hour and 15 minutes because of a curtain time, and our server Evie got us served up in plenty of time. She was efficient and attentive, not obtrusive. Service was very good!  Waiter and bartender very knowlegeable about their product.  My husband is a bourbon affecionado, and the bartender recommended some excellent choices. Food was very good! Beautiful atmosphere and decor.  Noise level was good.  Prices were somewhat overblown--the reason for four stars instead of five. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary. Food was fantastic!! We picked several small plates to share and then each had dessert. It was a lot of fun to be able to try tons of what they have to offer. The place we were seated was rather odd though. We walked through the beautiful dining area to this back room that looked like an office meeting area. Not the same ambience as the main area. Next to us was a table with a large party of about 15 people. Not the most romantic environment. If we ever decide to go back, I'd ask not to sit back there, especially when paying such a large bill for a nice night out."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and awesome outdoor seating area, with interesting people watching. I went there for happy hour and shared a few of the appetizers/small plates which were all very good!  The reason I am giving 3 stars only is because our waitress was a grade-A snooty jerk.  First, she condescendingly scoffed at each of our drink orders and basically forced us to get something different. That was weird. Then, when asking questions about the menu and for recommendations she rolled her eyes, tried to make us feel stupid, and was not helpful at all.  She was one of the most stuck up waitresses I have ever encountered.  I am hesitant to give Poros another try b/c that type of service really has left a negative impression on this place for me."}
{"text":"We went with 9 people. The service was excellent.  I had the grilled octopus appetizer with fennel which was    amazing. The fish is all fresh and was prepared beautifully. My wife had the Dover sole and loved it. My son had the flat bread appetizer which he said was excellent. The  only complaint was that we sat near the bar and it was very loud. I would definitely return for more. It was quite expensive but certainly worth it based on the quality of the food, excellent preparation and service. There was valet parking right in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place had a lot of hype so I figure I would check it out and it may be a nice \"girls night out\". Our table was a few mins behind so we were sent to the bar, the bartender explained each wine with tasters, which was fantastic. She made me try something that was out of my comfort zone which was a nice change of pace.     The decor was beautiful, the atmosphere was comfortable, it had a lounge type feel as well as a restaurant, meaning I could just grab a drink at the bar and that would have been fine.     Ok so the food... Menu was really confusing but our server gladly explained it. All the plates we ordered had very small portions. I love the idea of shared plates but be advised you only get one bite..... but everything was fantastic.  We even ordered a second plate of the ahi tuna because it was that good...it was a little expensive but I don't mind paying a higher price if I'm getting a higher quality meal..The chef is truly talented and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This afternoon a new friend and I had lunch at Poros. The Farmers Market was buzzing, news crew interviewing, and everyone enjoying the less humid days of summer in Pittsburgh. We had reservations through Open Table and were seated right away. It was a nice day so we opted for the patio. It wasn't too noisy even with the amount of groups dining.  Our server was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. He gave us time to chat and look over the menu with no rush. (I'm sorry I cannot remember his name! He was great!) We started off with the pita and veggies with three dips. Freshly cut vegetables and the pita was doughy and flavorful. Soon enough our Horiatiki and Chopped salads with salmon arrived. The fish was cooked perfectly and the salad was filling. We highly enjoyed our meal so much we opted to share a slice of their flourless chocolate cake which was SO GOOD! Easily one of the best I've had as often as you seen this type of cake on menus! Props Poros.   I only give a mark down for the pricing. Reservations are a good idea, but probably not needed. Please give Poros a try.Take your time and enjoy the day."}
{"text":"So my review is a little late, but I felt the need to write one because of the rude and unprofessional bartender I had the privilege to encounter at Poros. I can't remember his name or I would definitely call the restaurant about him because he was not only rude to me and my friends, but to a fellow bartender.   Two of my friends and I had a table outside for the Stanley cup playoff game. We had previously been drinking at the full bar and we couldn't get the bar tenders attention to cash out, so we went over to our table. Luckily, the waiter said since we weren't ordering any entrees, we could continue to order drinks from the bar. I went up for my third drink and provided him with my credit card for my tab. When I went to close my tab, the bartender put all of our drinks on my tab. Meanwhile one of my friends already cashed out. We brought up his receipt and proceeded to show the bartender and explain the situation. The bartender was aggressive and nasty, and did not want to refund me. Another bartender came over and told the other guy that he cashed out my friend and to fix my tab. Well this guy did not want to refund me. He rolled his eyes and proceeded to tell the other bartender to do it. I was appalled! I was so angry! I wanted to speak to a manager; however, it was late and I had to get home.   I hope a manger sees this review and speaks to the bartending staff to explain how a situation like this should be handled. I definitely will not be returning to Poros."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food. I have eaten here many times, but mostly because it is close by where I'm going. It is a bit overpriced, which made it lose a star. It has always been clean and staff friendly when I have been there. If you have nothing better to do then try it out."}
{"text":"Visiting our son in Pitt, we were looking for a nice seafood place. Love the Market Square location but we were disappointed with our meal because of poor service. The hostess was very pleasant and our waitress was nice but after we placed our order , we waited too long for our appetizers and she never return to refill our waters. In addition, we had to ask for napkins and waited at least an hour for our main course. My dish, swordfish ,was excellent but by then we were aggravated with the service. Beautiful restaurant with good food but for the price tge service needs to improve dramatically!"}
{"text":"We went here before a show at the Byham.  To start we got a bottle of white wine, calamari, the Mediterranean dip trio (baba, hummus, Tzatziki)  which came with pita/2 pieces of bread, and the fried eggplant & zucchini. The dip trio was GREAT! IT was a beet hummus which was slightly sweet but decent. The calamari needed something, salt? Pepper? something! There was not nearly enough aoli served with it for the 6 of us. The fried eggplant and zucchini was good very light not greasy at all and very chip like which proved to be enjoyable. They have a very extensive wine selection which is awesome.  Our waitress was attentive, helpful, kind, quick, and always around if/when we needed her.  The atmosphere was gorgeous and we had a great view of the ice skating at ppg place which we all loved. The restaurant is very clean and well managed.  Now, I ordered the scallops. I'm not a huge seafood fan but scallops are up there on my list of things I love. A good pan seared scallop really makes me happy. My food came and my first scallop was freezing cold in the center. It tasted good, but it was really under seared. Less of a crisp sear and more of a soggy oil sear for not near long enough. It definitely needed about 30 seconds more on each side. Second scallop, looked way more seared, was still freezing cold in the middle. I'm beginning to be disappointed. My fiance ordered the crispy skin dorade fillet. I tried it and it was very good. I can say that the fish and seafood is great quality and very fresh there. I couldn't finish my scallops so i passed them off to my fiance and his mom wanted a bite. She leaned over and says \"these really could have used a little more time on the grill\". At least I'm not the only one that sees it that way. Everyone else really enjoyed their food and i didn't feel appropriate complaining. Maybe it was just an off night? Who knows."}
{"text":"You must try! Absolutely stunning decor, superb meal, and outstanding service. We had Grilled Octopus for an appetizer. Commonly it is over cooked and rubbery. This was perfect . I had the Chilean sea bass which is one of my favorite fishes. The Greek salad (horiakiki) was awesome. I have been craving it since I left. It's simple but flavorful. My next visit I have already decided I'm having the prawns. You will see them staring at you when you walk in the door. It takes any place a little time to get up and running smoothly. I would say the kinks are worked out and you need to eat here soon!"}
{"text":"I can't pin my finger on it, but something about Poros reminds me of a resort restaurant. Perhaps it's the smell of seafood, modern decor and electric blue lighting, mixed with the light tropical instrumental music. It is especially the case in the summertime when they open up their patio. I've been here several times, once for drinks and once for lunch and I can't say I was entirely impressed with either experience. For lunch, I ordered the tempura fish \"sandwich\" and it left a lot to be desired; there wasn't much flavor. The fish itself was decent but I think the accompaniments could have used more flavor. Unfortunately, Poros won't really one of my go-to's."}
{"text":"I love it!  The restaurant has awesome decor and the bar lights up :)  I first came for happy hour and was very impressed with the cocktails.  They were so amazing that we had to try them all!  Now my only wish is that they had more options!  We tried a few great appetizers.  The hummus and cheese and olives were very good but the Fig and Duck Confit Baklava was by far my favorite!   I highly recommend.  I came back for dinner and couldn't decide what to get so I ordered the Chef's Odyssey where the chef picks five courses (including dessert).  I told them what I was interested in and they were very accommodating to my request.  There was so much food and it was all delicious!  Mussels, lamb heart souvlaki (bacon wrapped deliciousness!), shrimp, a whole fish (Lavraki) tandoor style with asparagus, and a mini versions of all of the desserts! I couldn't eat it all but desperately wanted to.  It's a great time!"}
{"text":"The fresh fish is only the start. Entering POROS you are faced with the fresh fish counter. After your seated be sure. To go back and talk to the experts on the fish selection. The knowledgeable and personable folks will be sure to walk you through taste and texture suggestions. After that enjoy.  We stopped at the bar for desert and after dinner drinks with Jess. Best service ever. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to give my first 5 star review but awful service ruined the day. Food was very nice! We both had fish dishes that were perfectly prepared. The chef even came out to make sure he understood my food allergies!  The service was the worst I have had in a long time. So much so that yes, I will name her. Lauren took more than 10 minutes to approach our table and only after another server prompted her. She brought my mother's beverage, but not mine. I had to ask again. My mother had to ask 3x for sugar for tea and eventually got up and got it herself. Lauren saw her and turned the other way. We waited a long time for our appetizer, eggplant pie, it was barely warm. My mother did not want to complain and ate some of it. We waited even longer for our first course from the pick 2 lunch specials. We were there close to an hour before we got our salads. Lauren was not rude, but not attentive for drink refills and requests and not timely. I don't fault a sever when the kitchen is slow but this was not about that.   I would want to return but this poor service has me thinking twice."}
{"text":"When I first walked into the restaurant I was impressed by the decor and ambience. It was a beautiful day so the front doors were opened up to a patio with outside seating giving the bar area an inviting open air feel.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the menu, however I enjoyed my meal as did the others in my party. But in my opinion the quality and service was under par compared to other restaurants at this price point.  The service was quite poor. The staff was pleasant enough, but everything was extremely slow... Slow to bring drinks, slow to take orders, slow to bring food, etc.    Would I go back? Definitely not to eat, but would happily return to have drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Seafood brunch options are worth it! Desserts are decadent. Ingredients are fresh and flavors work well together. Service is average but friendly. Typical brunch drink options are affordable and welcome. Great location in Market Square for both locals and tourists."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner at Poros!  It was a really warm night for October so we choose to sit outside which gave us great people watching with our dinner.  We started with a three dips appetizer which was hummus, babaganoush and tzatzki, all 3 very good but the $2 upcharge the veggies to dip in them was not worth it as the veggies were very space and a little dried out.  Entrees were the seafood sampler for my husband and me, ahi tuna and swordfish for our friends.  The sampler was good with the seabass being the best bite of the plate.  My friends said their entrees were as good as they looked.  We had the apple crisp special and the chocolate flourless torte for shared desserts.  The apple crisp didn't have much crisp on it and the dish was overwhelmed by a huge scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and had the salmon.  It was absolutely beautiful on a bed of quinoa and kale.  The meal itself was filling and tasted so healthy and fresh.   I will definitely come back.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable as well as accommodating.   Poros hit the mark!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner before, but I stopped in for a few appetizers and some drinks this time.   All seafood, but SO fresh and awesome. A great place to get seafood in Pittsburgh if you want fresh and safe fish.   We sat at the bar this time, and the service was just okay. I thought they could've been more attentive to us. Regardless, the food was fine. Like I said, we only got appetizers this time around, so I had a way better experience when I came for dinner a few months ago.   Everything we ordered was good: the three dips with pita and veggies; eggplant & zucchini chips and dip; and fried calamari. The only thing we didn't really like was the Taziki dip... SO garlicy! And we love garlic, so that's saying a lot.   I'd recommend this for a nice family dinner or meeting a friend for drinks and a dinner."}
{"text":"I have gone there several times and found it very enjoyable. Friendliness of staff is very important to me. As I always say, a server can drop the entire dinner on me but if they are friendly, I'm ok with it.  The staff was outstanding in service and the friendliness was genuine and appreciated . The atmosphere is relaxing. The decor is classy. The Pinot I had was surprisingly good as it was the bar Pinot used for happy hour. The presentation of entrees and appetizers was very pleasing. The menu has a lot of variety with the emphasis on seafood. I highly recommend Poros and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The food is really great! I went here with my boyfriend and two work colleagues for lunch. Though they are experiencing some kinks (our waitress referred to it as an algebra equation!) the food was fantastastic and the service was excellent, which is what really matters. For example, there was a cold draft at our table, so they offered to move us to a different part of the restaurant and gave us complimentary bowls of their awesome lamb soup. And- they ran out of tea (common to have to make adjustments in inventory when just opening a restaurant), but they offered to steep fresh herbs in water for us. It is this attention to detail that set them apart, and will make them a go-to destination.   Go now-and when you do, be patient and give them a little break for being new. I can guarantee- if you're a kind-hearted person who likes Mediterranean food, you will have a positive experience at this restaurant.  P.S. Ask for Cori- she is an awesome waitress who made us feel super comfortable! She's stellar."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch and was very impressed. I noticed that many reviews mentioned the higher prices, but I really didn't notice that here (maybe because it was just for lunch).  The ambiance is modern, warm, and welcoming. The menu is rather large, but encompasses all of your staples.  For lunch, I had the grilled chicken sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised by the vast amount of ingredients that went into this simple sandwich. To me, that signifies a great level of culinary expertise. The sandwich was very tasty and filled me up past full.  Lastly, the staff was very nice and pleasant. I will definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"So loved this place. Nice and chic. Went after work for happy hour. The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. I had a couple of questions and they guided me thru the menu.   I ordered the red sangria to start. Man, does it pack a punch. I ordered another one, and I thought I was fine. I had to uber home because I wasn't going to make it. The sangria is so tasty, but I'm afraid that it is more brandy than wine.   I also had the bread and dip trip for my appetizer. I'm not a hummus fan, but the eggplant dip, is delicious. I totally recommend that one. And the bread is grilled to perfection. Such a nice place to go during the week for happy hour. Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wow. My expectations weren't crazy high because of the mixed reviews, but Poros was a great place for a business lunch.   We started with the hummus -- it was amazing. I particularly loved the charred bread they served it with. If I could have eaten 10 slices without embarrassing myself I probably would have.   For my meal I had the prix fixe with the horiatiki salad and the fish dujour which was a barramundi. the horiatiki was the only thing I wasn't crazy about. It was sort of a deconstructed salad so it was big chunks of tomato, a HUGE triangular piece of feta, some \"spears\" of cucumber, etc. If you love the flavors of these things you'll like it but I prefer more of a mixed salad so I get a little of everything in each bite. I do have to say that everything was very fresh however.   As for the fish; it was a skin on barramundi served with a green pepper harissa and a peach farro salad. WOW. the fish was amazing. So light and fresh and charred to perfection. I thought I would be grossed out by the skin on (I'm not a huge fish person) but I loved it. It was so flavorful...almost like a crust. The harissa was an excellent touch without being overpowering. The peach farro salad was such an interesting flavor combination but it really worked well. The meal left me satiated without feeling bloated.   I also have to remark on the service, which was perfect. From the moment we were escorted to our table, our every need was attended to. My iced tea was never even half empty, and our waiter was very knowledgeable and made some great recommendations! (I'm sorry I can't remember his name!) Our plates were promptly cleared when we finished and the timing of the whole meal was perfect.    One other thing -- they had these amazing little raw sugar cubes for the iced tea...to die for! I wish I could get them for my house!   Some other people have complained that it was expensive. The prix fixe menu was the way to go (not sure that they have that for dinner). The \"fish market\" menu could get expensive quickly, with fish priced by the ounce. Lunch for two came to $46 before tip, and that included an appetizer. Not cheap by any means but not outrageous and definitely worth it in my mind.   Final comment will be on the decor. The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. Comfortable yet sophisticated. I was totally impressed."}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere, the waitress and the server we had were awesome. The seared Salmon was great. I think the chef went a little too heavy with the oil on the Kale and quinoa but overall a very nice experience. Definitely wont be the last time I eat there!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, but my favorite part was the bathroom. It made me feel like a mermaid."}
{"text":"This has been on my list of places to try for a while so I was excited to check it out but whoa what a let down.  Market square was full of people last night so it was great for people watching bad for parking.  Poros has a $10 valet service but do a drive by spin around the block and you might get lucky and find free street parking a block away like we did.    The restaurant is sparkly & beautiful w/ giant fish tanks, a huge bar area & super fancy chandeliers plus the doors open to outdoor seating.  Since it was hot out we sat inside (didn't help I was still sweaty).  We were led to the way back to sit at a table that had a nice view of the fountain but I wish we were more up near the front or in one booths.    For drinks I ordered the red sangria and hubby got the Lebanese rosè (who knew there was such a thing?) - he won on drinks - my sangria was too syrupy sweet - yuck.  Grilled octopus we got to start was good - not chewy & good flavor.  For dinner we got lamb chops and the grilled Chilean sea bass - get the fish-you order the kind and size you want and how to prepare it.  Sizes range from 5-8 oz and for my fish it was $5/oz.  It's a la carte for the fish so get a side or you'll just have a piece of fish on a plate (seriously).  They didn't have any rice/grain side dish (they should change that) but I saw they served farro with some entrees so I asked for a small bowl of that and the server made it happen. My fish was heavenly - so buttery and seasoned perfectly. That's why it sucked so bad that lovey's lamb chops, while cooked to the right temp, were bland. And the rest of what was plated-fancy string beans and some kind of purée wasn't worth it.  Once he got the salt and pepper it was a little better but honestly, he makes better lamb chops than these - so underwhelming.    Service was weird- our waiter was a young kid who talked super fast, almost bordering on pompous.  He didn't seem like he had a lot of tables so he wasn't busy he was probably just a douche?  He made himself scarce for the rest of our meal which sucked because we needed water and maybe we would've ordered more drinks but he didn't check so we just ate quickly and skedaddled.  We should've left our water glass tipped over since it was empty most of the night.   Won't be back - too pricey to be underwhelmed with the food and I can get Chilean sea bass just as good and cheaper and with a full plated dinner at Mitchell's.  Wish it was better because I love market square"}
{"text":"The food was good but ridiculously over-priced. I ordered their Seafood Targine, which was delicious, but it was not worth thirty-five dollars. I do not know how much fish they actually gave me but it could not have been more than 6-7 oz (this would be a generous estimation). The entree had one shrimp, one scallop, one small peice of Chilean sea bass, and four muscles. The size of the muscle shell was deceiving as the size of the meat inside was half what I would have expected. The entree was served in a type of tomatoe sauce, which was very good, and had potatoes, cauliflower, and some small onions. Alas, portion size was less than mediocre. The food was good quality, service was outstanding, but I left hungry."}
{"text":"Vegetarian perspective.  Ambiance 5 Service 5 Food 3 Cocktails 4  Went here in a Sunday night around 6:30 pm, not too crowded given it was snowing. Has a lot of seating so reservations should be easy.  Ambiance is nice, see picture. I also enjoyed the top 40s/pop type music they played though A felt that it was a bit distracting. Our server, Olivia, was super bubbly and helpful, honest about what we might like. Her suggestion of the Athens dirty pillow was spot on for my husband who liked old fashions. It tastes just like one but a bit lighter and less sweet, we really enjoyed it.  We started with the baba ghanosh which came with house made pita (yum) and sourdough (ok). The baba itself was just ok, we've had better at Naya on squirrel hill.  As a vegetarian- I greatly enjoyed the \"risotto\" and enjoyed the farro texture. Our server was very honest about it not being a typical risotto. I also loved the cauliflower. If you order these two they are definetly enough for a meal for a vegetarian.  My carnivore husband got the grilled octopus and lamb pastitchio. He felt disappointed in the quality of the dishes, felt like octopus was a bit tough and that the lamb dish tasted like meatloaf.  I would have given them 4 stars but will downgrade given his opinion. Our meal was $72 including tip.   If we were to come again he would take better advantage of the fish and do the made to order option."}
{"text":"Great design and love the terrace right in the center of Market Square, however, location and decorations means little to nothing when your food is bland and your servers are borderline rude. We also got charged for something we didn't order. Overall, overpriced restaurant with terrible service. There are better places downtown to drop cash on drinks. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, before Poros was open, I made a birthday reservation for my Mumsie. I was devastated to find out the restaurant hadn't opened as scheduled when they called THAT MORNING to tell me we couldn't have dinner there. I don't hold a grudge. I swear. To prove it, allow me to tell you how delightful my lunch there today was. I indulged in the 2-course Lunch Prix Fixe, which included a Smoked Salmon appetizer and Fish du Jour/Arctic Char...my favorite. The server was polite and attentive, the salmon was flavorful and the Char was perfection. I left a touch hungry (but not surprised given this isn't the Olive Garden), and wouldn't drop $17 on lunch every day, but that's what the $1 cones at McDonald's are for in both cases."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Saturday night.  A nice modern feel is quite evident as soon as you walk in.  Started off at the bar for a cocktail.  This is a full-service bar that offers a decent variety of craft beer, across many styles, macro brews, wine, Ouzo and specialty cocktails.  The wine menu here focuses strongly on Greek grape varieties, though it has a few choices from other areas, including California.  Greek varietals are often hard to pronounce but do not be afraid to ask your bartender here to assist you. The bartender, Dolan, was extremely friendly, prompt and knowledgable.  He allowed my wife and I to try some of the wines ahead of time before making our purchase.    After having a cocktail we were seated and on our way.  The menu is very diverse, offering many small plate options if you are just looking for some appetizers or shareable dishes.  The menu offers a wide variety of choices, but the focal point is definitely around seafood and lamb.  Seafood options include many Mediterranean fish like Branzino, Sea Bream and head-n prawns.  They also have lobster tail, halibut, scallops, ahi tuna, sea bass, shrimp...etc.  In addition, the menu features several lamb options from Jamison and Elysian Fields.    We opted decided to explore the menu by trying all sorts of things.  We got started by having some Baba Ghanoush, mussels and stuffed peppers as appetizers.  All were really good but my favorite were the mussels in ouzo broth.  For our main course, I opted for the Branzino fillet with three scallops and the better half went with fennel stuffed Branzino.    The fish was cooked perfectly, very impressed.   Since we want to be more gluttonous, we decided on dessert.  I had the doughnuts in honey syrup and pistachios and the wife had the chocolate flour less tort.  Both excellent!  Having read the reviews here previously, I was not sure what to expect.  For me, it was a great experience.  Dolan, Christian (our server) and Alan (Sommelier) were all top notch.  Very friendly, willing to help and answer questions, prompt and efficient.  I found the staff to be very well educated on the food and wine menus, which helped in the dining experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is wonderful.  I went with a few friends on a Saturday night.  We started with the dips...and the hummus was by far the best. The pita was fresh tasty. I ordered the spanikopita and pastitsio. They are under starters, but I figured 2 starters would be enough......wrong. The $9 serving of spanikopita was the size of two spring rolls and the $11 pastitsio was small as well. Both were good,  the lamb in the pastitsio was incredible,  but not worth the price. As someone who has been to Greece, I can say tiny portions are not part of the culture.  The food is very good,  but I feel overpriced for what you are getting as a meal."}
{"text":"Great place. Shana the bartender is awesome. Great drinks, food and atmosphere. Also, excellent service!"}
{"text":"Wandered up to the patio like jerks and were instantly taken care of by the lovely Brittany, who was the manager on duty. She sat us with Laurea (sp?) who was charming and recommended food portions we could handle. Mostly wanted the wine, which she helped narrow down from their impressive list. Will definitely return to this oasis villa in the middle of the square!"}
{"text":"I have been here for work lunches several times with lukewarm feelings. Last night I hosted clients there for dinner. I have to say, service and food has improved.   Our server was wonderful. We were out to have a good time and she read our group perfectly. She provided excellent wine/menu recommendations and joked/interacted with everyone at the table. Her ability to read my guests helped to make me look good (thank you!!).  We ordered oysters, hummus, and calamari for starters. The calamari lacked a bit of flavor, but it was cooked well. The other appetizers were loved by all.   Dinner was primarily sea bass and scallops. I had the duck. The duck was fantastic and I tried the sea bass, perfectly cooked and some of the best I've had in town.   For dessert, I highly recommend the baklava ice cream. It took a while to get used to the texture of a baked good in ice cream, but the flavor was awesome.    Thank you for helping me show my clients a great time. The food was excellent and the service was even better."}
{"text":"The service was average, the food was better than expected, but came out of the kitchen in a staggered manner."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Market Square. The bar and the outside area are so nice and romantic. The food is good! The service can be a little slow but if your not in a huge rush it won't be a problem."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with a reservation.  The place was fairly packed.  We started with the stuffed grilled calamari that was excellent, but not consistent.  There were three pieces and two were delicious and the third was a little spicy which was odd.  It was still good, but it was unusual that they didn't all match.  It came on a bed of oily, but tasty spinach.   I had the stuffed dorade which I had heard about it, but I have never seen it on a menu in Pittsburgh.  It was outstanding.  Not a strong flavored fish, but meaty.  It was stuffed with saffroned, creamy crab on a bed of raisin spiced couscous and asparagus.  My friend had the halbut chargrilled with fingerlings.  It was all delicious.  The sauce that comes with the chargrilled fish is outstanding.   While a pricey meal, it was certainly worth it and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night there. Food was amazing, fresh, flavorful  and cooked perfectly. Had the beets to start they were out of this world  and bought local at a farm near by. Also we had salads and entrees. The sea bass might have been the best i ever had. So moist, flaky, buttery yummy. The wine list was ok not impressed with selection by the glass at all. Definitely go back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner before a concert. We had appetizers, seafood, vegan and Mediterranean entrees. Everyone had a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Passed by this new place and wanted to check it out.  Beautiful interior.  Our bartender, Jennifer, was a gem and knowledgable about the menu.  My roasted vegetable plate was spot on, and the rest of our food and beverage choices were great.  Perfect atmosphere for hanging out or on a date."}
{"text":"What a fantastic appetizer meal we had. Drinking cocktails. People watching on the square. The pork rillette with poutin & feta cheese was fantastic.  Friendly helpful staff.  Great seating."}
{"text":"I dined here in a business lunch setting and thought the food, service, and atmosphere were all excellent.  If you get a spot on the patio, you also get a bonus view of Market Square.  The charred bread that came with our hummus appetizer was particularly good, and my steak salad was so classy and on point.  I am definitely interested in returning for dinner or drinks sometime."}
{"text":"I don't know. The food was good, but it just seems so expensive for what you are getting. I ordered a $16 softshell crab and that was literally all I got, a single small soft shell crab on a plate.   My favorite item was the Chips Poros, a generous piling of fried Zucchini and eggplant chips with Tzatziki. I'd highly recommend it.   The service here was exceptional. The waiter was very attentive and helpful in the ordering process.  The restaurant is tapas-style and we weren't sure how much we needed to order to serve our group.   So while the food is good, the portions and prices aren't so much. Since it is small plates, you can easily control your bill cost, but that would also be at the expense of having a satisfied appetite. I will probably only return here if I'm invited by friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant has 3 stars right now for a reason. It's very new, but it has a lot of potential!!  The pros: the man at the front desk was amazing. They were overbooked and super busy, and I did not have a reservation, but the host helped us get a table by asking people to consolidate at the bar. Totally went out of his way for us and worked very hard to make it happen!  The atmosphere is sick! Great color scheme and super fun.  The food has potential, I just think they are trying to find their way.  The cons:  service is still new and they struggle with getting things out in a timely fashion. Took around 10 mins to place a drink order, another 10+ mins to receive the drink and place a food order.  Then took around 20+ mins to receive the food. If you ask the servers what they recommend you get a deer in headlights look. The two drinks we ordered were not very good. My gin drink was way too fancy and a huge fail. The flavors were all over the place. Orange peel was in my sisters drink as well and it just felt out of place.  The menu is confusing. There are some small plates that aren't exactly small and some meals that are smaller than normal. The entire trip took way too long.   It's worth a try to come here, just ask questions and hope someone will answer you :-)."}
{"text":"underwhelming and expensive. on the upside, food tasted great. however, the portions were TINY and WAY overpriced.  $24 for 3 scallops and it comes with nothing?  not even bread for the table?  ridiculous.  appetizers are not large enough for even 2 to share. also, they have an extremely limited number of choices for sides considering that the bulk of the menu consists of the aforementioned insanely overpriced a la carte items that once again, come with nothing.   server was friendly but seemed confused. the kitchen was out of several items, but then there were other items not on the menu, and she didnt seem to know much about any of it. she struggled with a few basic questions about ingredients in both cocktails and meals.  lastly, 2 of our party of 4 found pinbones in our fish.    nobody had a whole fish, so no excuse for this. if your restaurant is centered on fish, maybe try harder to get the bones out."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was somewhat disappointing, mostly because of the crude service. The server was rough and largely absent. Our entres arrived before the beet salad. The food was pretty good, as usual. The restaurant was not full even though market square was buzzing with activity. I guess the thrill is gone from Poros. Too bad."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quickly becoming one of my favorites. They just opened and our working out the kinks. Tonight's service was on point. The food was amazing and well cooked. We ate dim sum and not one of our selections disappointed. The calamari was cooked to perfection. I would give five stars but want to wait to see how my next visit turns out."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful with a lovely relaxed open air feel right on busy market square. Food delicious. If QUITE expensive $40 for a 4xx4x1\"  piece of fish. Gets only 3 stars because of value for money and  flaws in service. Which is pretentious but Relaxed to the point of dismissive. . Explained in great detail the menu is all ala cart. The only veg options are half sized vegetables and potato options and choices like Baba, salad or hummus. There are no veg entrees. Uneducated or unimaginative chef.  The portions for the fish and other entrees are tiny but can be ordered in mass quantities, expensive  but cant see what else hungry men can do. Tiny portions on huge white dishes add to the humor.  Tepid Water with no ice never refilled. More drinks never offered. No bread or nibbles. You know the drill. Waiter never asked if meals were ok. And when you ask for water, it  smells as if the sea bass was recently swimming in it. More detergent in the dishwasher please!!  If you don't accept the waiters suggestions he makes a face. Busboy spilled water on SOs pants.  Out of lovely dessert  at 6 PM. We ignored the costs and lapses in service and did have a lovely time.  As i said the atmosphere is lovely. Theres convenient valet but i do not believe the place is handicapped accessible. The bathroom is down down down two flights of stairs and around and around a long hallway i do not believe theres an elevator.  So if you have any mobility issues either hold it or go elsewhere. Not for families.  Maybe if we had had a better waiter.."}
{"text":"This place got rave reviews from some family, so I decided to join them this time and give it a try.   It's really a 3.5 for me, I think.    For starters, let me say that the service was excellent.  We were in a private room (our request) and had settled in for a leisurely meal.  The server was attentive and knowledgeable.  She was able to answer all of our many questions and overall was the star of the evening.     The food was good, but each course had some sort of little \"thing\" that caught my attention.   Overall, it was a solid meal, but it didn't wow me for the fanciness of the place.     We started with several dishes of the Chips Poros and an order of the Flaming Cheese Saganaki.   The Chips Poros were a solid start to the meal, even if they were a touch underseasoned.   The Flaming Cheese Saganaki was the best thing I had all evening.   The presentation of that was a little clunky though.  First, they brought out the brandy, lemon, etc. just so that it was there.  The cheese came later and he stood away from the table (behind several of us) to light it.  Didn't really see what was happening there.  It was difficult to pass around due to the hot plate, so I only really got a bite.   That bite was delicious though.      Then onto the salads.  Several of us split salads.  They came out separately plated and were good, but again, the process was sort of clunky.  The half salad was more than enough as a starter; but in order to get a half, you had to find someone to eat the other half.   I'd rather just be able to order a small salad.     The entrees were all good, though I accidentally over-ordered.  The salmon from the fish menu actually did come with some sides, making the a la carte sides I ordered unnecessary.  I ended up taking them home in a box.     Also, let's take a moment to talk about the bathrooms.   Yuck!   The bathrooms were not well kept and clearly not attended to at all during the couple of hours that we were there.  For the scale of the space, the bathrooms were smelly and gross."}
{"text":"Went into the restaurant just because it looked great from the outside. Big mistake.They took 20 minutes to seat us even though i saw several unoccupied tables(We were on a road trip,maybe we didn't dress fancy enough).  They were out of 1/4th dishes and were also out of chicken(what restaurant runs out of chicken?) at 10 pm. I was really hungry so I ordered a whole fish, the Fennel Stuffed Lavraki served with a pilaf. The pilaf was alright but the fish was almost unseasoned though it was cooked well in the tandoor.The Grilled Stuffed Calamari that my friend  actually had a bitter after taste and I had to watch him struggle. Kamut & Freekeh Risotto was a sensible portion but tasted like savoury oatmeal. Shrimp Saganaki was the only dish that was actually edible. Im giving the second star because the seafood quality was really great."}
{"text":"Had dinner there Friday, the food and vibe was awesome!  Seemed like a Pittsburgh place to be.  They were packed and didn't seem to have a complete handle on it.  We didn't get our appetizers and I ordered a salad that also didn't come, but dinner and our side dishes were awesome.  There was not a crumb left.  Same with dessert.  I also like how you can order three different portion sizes of the fish.  I don't know anywhere else where you can do that.  I really hate having portions that can feed an army as I can only eat a small meal.  I will go there again for sure!"}
{"text":"Poros is a great lunch/dinner spot right in Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh. We started with the dips. You can pick one or two or get a discount if you pick all three. I thought all three dips were delicious-- Hummus, Baba Ganoush and Tzatziki served with pita and bread. My friend and I split the Chicken Shwarma and the Grilled Cheese sandwiches. I thought the Chicken was delicious, but the Grilled Cheese left a little something to be desired. That being said, I think it's hard to make a grilled cheese memorable.  I REALLY want to go back and have some seafood dishes here because it seems like that is what they really specialize in. They have a gorgeous display of fresh fish and thinking about Chilean Sea Bass makes my mouth water!"}
{"text":"What a disappointing meal. I never thought that a restaurant that features a display case of fish could fail at the preparation of seafood. Both my appetizer and whole fish were beyond well done; rubbery octopus and dried lavraki. Try the potato, it was the best part of the meal. Service started great but fizzled to a flop."}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch recently.  I don't have any big complaints about the food, the service or the decor but I just wasn't feeling it.   First off, they did an amazing job on the space.  It's lovely, and they have a great outdoor patio to enjoy in the warm weather.  It's a large space but it was pretty dead during the lunch hour.  The restaurant wasn't even half full when we went for lunch, and Market Square restaurants are usually packed at lunch.  The menu was, in my mind, pretty limited for the average \"nonfoodie.\"   Greek and seafood doesn't always have mass appeal and buying by the ounce for fish at market prices is pretty expensive.   I had the chicken shawarma sandwich for lunch, and it was tasty but I've had the same option at Madonna's and liked their cheaper version equally well.    I had the side of ancient grain pasta salad but didn't enjoy it as I found it a little dry and lacking flavor.  I'd love to see this place succeed but I just think the menu is too limited and too pricey for the average diner!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked to our table, past the case with the fresh fish, to when we were handed the check, our experience exceeded my expectations. Our server, Heather, walked us through every aspect of the menu, from wine to dessert, and made fantastic recommendations.   It would take me all day to write down everything we ordered at the table, so just take my word for it that you can order ANYTHING and it will be delicious."}
{"text":"Recent Lunch meeting reservation:  Food was excellent once arriving after 35 minutes.  Long time for salads and especially when we got there at 11:45 before the lunch crowd.   Still new, still working out the kinks, but, poor food runner came to our table 4 times with the wrong plates...  Great restaurant over all. Great happy hours!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for the first time this week on a whim.  Bar area is your typical trendy new spot.  Service was attentive.  Appetizers were great!  While the humus was just good, the eggplant chips and Taziki sauce was spectacular.  My wife loved her salad, fish and shrimp.  I got whole fish prepared tandor style.  It was just ok (not a great deal of taste).  Both deserts (flourless brownie and baklava ice cream) where good.  Overall A bit overpriced, but still a great experience."}
{"text":"My friends and I were very excited to try Poros for a birthday celebration. The decor and overall look of the restaurant was beautiful!!!!! One of the nicest decor in Pittsburgh. I give a 5 on ambiance.   We made reservations a month in advance for 11 people and waited 25 minutes to still be seated. Manager was nice and gave us 6 free appetizers for our wait. We got the flatbread, octopus, and 3 dips. The appetizers were not bad. Tzatziki was the best and the octopus was delicious. The other dips were average... Like it came out of a pre-packaged container. The flatbread was also OK. We kept having to ask for Pita bread because they gave only 2 full pitas for 11 people....  After asking the server what she recommends and is the most popular dish she said it was the Crispy Dorade (chef speciality).  The fish was supposed to be stuffed with crab meat and have greens on top. The Greens were wilted and old looking. The crab meat tasted as though it came out of a can. The fish itself tasted like it was freezer burned. Nothing about my dish was good and I was extremely disappointed in the quality- being that it was $32 and had all the potential to be delicious. Other people at the table took a bite and immediately spit it out. I had 3 bites and that was it. Very very poor food quality.   My husband got the octopus small plate and shrimp saganaki. Having went to several Greek restaurants the saganaki tasted like spaghetti sauce with feta crumbles on top. I have never seen something like that. It had barely any cheese  and saganaki is primarily a cheese dish and does not have spaghetti sauce in it. Gross.   A couple people at the table got the scallops and lobster tail. Another disappointment. The lobster tail was cooked so much you could not get the meat out of the shell. The scallops were also over cooked.   I got wine and a cocktail. It was the best part of the night. 5 people took there food back and the server did not seem to care at all.  I asked for my tab and waited 25 minutes and still did not get the tab. I had to get up and ask a different server finally for my tab. We started dinner at 8:45pm and did not leave from there until 12am because of how long everything took. It was not even a busy night on the restaurant side.   Overall I would be VERY surprised if this restaurant stays open for very long. I think they need experienced servers and much better chefs.  They should have put the money into the quality of the food rather than so much into the decor. Huge disappointment.   Lastly, the birthday girl was puking 2 hours later after eating at Poros. Bad sign.  Do not go and dine there. If you want to, just get drinks and maybe a few small plates. There are PLENTY of fantastic restaurants in Pittsburgh to choose from... this is just not one of them."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! Staff was very friendly. Excellent waitress. Food was fresh and quick. Had grilled octopus, grilled salmon, and baklava ice cream. Also wanted to try the apricot cake, but I was not of fan of it. Will probably go back again."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here recently.  Our server and the bartender were both excellent.  The food was delicious - some of which was a little adventurous for me. But I can now say I have tried octopus - it was very tasty and fairly benign, so don't be afraid!  This is not an inexpensive venture - luckily I was not buying.  If you want to go all out expect to spend some $$$.  Although, I loved the lamb flatbread - $12 - i think.  That and a drink or two would be a very nice munch for me and a friend.    This is a very pretty modern place and if nothing else a great place to stop for a drink."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. Was served the best kale salad. Desserts were enough to share with two others."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend and we shared the 3 appetizers (roasted cauliflower hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzatziki).  Out of the three, I preferred the cauliflower hummus.  I'm usually a huge fan of baba ghanoush, I love the smokey, eggplanty, creamy taste of it, but the way that it was done at Poros, it was more like zesty hummus with no smokiness or hint of eggplant.  I was disappointed and didn't like it very much.    For my main dish, I ordered the salata poros with the salmon.  The salad was very fresh and tasty but the Salmon was fairly bland.  It was cooked very well but I wish it had some flavor.  I asked for salt and pepper and was able to finish it along with much of the salad.    Overall, it was a decent and healthy lunch.  I really liked the decor of the place and it was huge inside."}
{"text":"Great meal. Branzino was incredible, highly recommend this place. Very upscale environment, full bar, right in the center of Pittsburgh. Come here if you want a nice night on the town."}
{"text":"Everything was great. We had a very late reservation (11 pm) and we never felt rushed or like we were an inconvenience. The restaurant is beautiful and like nothing that Pittsburgh has ever had before.   The wilted greens, Chilean sea bass and baklava ice cream were the standouts of the meal although everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Friends and I met here for lunch over the lunch hour.  We made reservations, but you probably don't need to if you get there before noon.  The atmosphere is very cool inside and out for Pittsburgh.  The food matches the environment - exceptional.  We all tried different sandwiches and were pleased.  The fries were preferred over the grains though."}
{"text":"Where do I begin... We had reservations for our 30th wedding anniversary. When seated by the host I mentioned this fact. He could not have cared any less by his reaction.  It took at least 15 minutes for our waiter, Ryan to appear, complete with excuses as to why it took so long. Something about not knowing we were his table.  We had had plenty of time to go over the menu and English is our first language but Ryan had a Jody to do and darn it if anyone was going to stop him. He explained the entire menu to us as if we were blind (we are not). He then took drink and appetizer orders and said if there was anything else we needed to just ask. Then he disappeared for 20 minutes.  Then the drinks and appetizers came, we ordered our entrees and again he said if there was anything we needed to just ask. And disappeared. How could we ask him for something when he would disappear for days on end?   This was just one of the irritating things about the service. There were others that seem to be from personality traits. But the worst was when we got the bill... My Chilean sea bass which was delicious but not presented well at all, was double charged at 2 different prices. When we pointed this out Ryan removed the cheaper price. Who's to say my fish wasn't the lower price? This was too much for my husband.  All in all, that food was okay, too much eggplant in the Moroccan veggies, fish is good.  Cocktails were okay but not for the price. I don't care what the favorite food is for the wait staff, I can read a menu.  Sincerity should never be faked. If you dont care maybe you should rethink your career path."}
{"text":"Got seated for lunch at 1145.   Food didn't come until 1:20.  For a place downtown that needs to cater to a business crowd, this is ridiculous.  One of our party needed to leave to get back to work and left without eating anything. Once the food came, it was OK nothing truly remarkable."}
{"text":"Something happened to Poros. The menu is different and food is mediocre. We invited our friends on November 25th and were embarrassed. Besides the different menu, my favorite grilled vegetables were awfully overcooked, I had stuffed branzino which was just burned! Just blacked outside and overlooked inside"}
{"text":"Went for drinks and dinner. Martini was great, cosmopolitan had a little too much cranberry. We had red snapper and halibut grilled. Both were excellent with perfectly cooked asparagus and really good potatoes as I side. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful!  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere . Love the smart decor and olive tree.  Love the fresh and clean feel of the menu.  Pittsburgh food scene needs seafood options and this is a nice addition. 3-1/2 star is not accurate. Needs to be 4"}
{"text":"I'm going to be short here. We waited at the entrance for a good 2 minutes before someone acknowledged us. Once we were addressed the gentleman was very nice and eager to please. We were sat immediately with our reservation. The server was nice. They should just leave a water pitcher at the tables seeing as the water glasses are not very big. The food. Ok. Now my theory is that they take so long in between taking orders and serving the food so that your appetite diminishes. That being said. The portions were so ridiculously small! I was actually getting agitated. I spent $30 on a 3oz fish that was on top of 1 shrimp, 1 scallop, 2 little square cut potato, and 2 little round onions! I have been eating out at nice places for the last 4 days straight for every meal, this is by far the worst. There is absolutely no reason at all to serve such little portions for the extreme amount you are charging. I do not care how much money a person has. There is no reason for this. Needless to say. You are paying for the atmosphere, which they should enforce a dress code, and the name. The server was good, attentive, knowledgeable, and kind. Management was also nice and took pride in their work. The establishment was clean, creative style to it. The prices for the amount of food was so unnecessary. Quality can not even be an excuse. The drink prices were pretty average for a nicer restaurant. Sorry, but it is very true. I am always honest with my reviews. And having to actually be emotionally upset about that, deems these opinions to be said, necessary."}
{"text":"Ok, so the space is awesome, I'll give them that. It looks straight out of Miami. Poros is the newest addition to the restaurant group that also runs Sonoma, Seviche, NOLA, and Perlé.  The waitress sounded knowledgeable and helpful in picking out a wine and suggesting some things on the menu. Though the wine she suggested was $20 more than the one we picked originally and we didn't realize until the bill.. oh well. We were told the wine was a fairly dry wine, but really it was pretty sweet and fruity and didn't have much of a pucker factor as far as dryness. I liked it, since I don't mind a sweeter wine, but it wasn't exactly what we were looking for especially for $20 more than expected.  Per our waitresses suggestion, we started with the Ouzo Cured Salmon which was supposedly the best thing on the menu. It was just okay. The dish was sliced salmon on top of some shaved fennel with a dollop of Tzatziki on the side. We ended up asking for some pita to put it on since we were sharing, and it was a small plate.  For an entree we both chose 7oz boneless fillets. I got the Ahi Tuna, he got the Chilean Seabass. They are both $5 an ounce. I didn't try his, but he said it was good and mostly because it was very buttery - haha. The Ahi Tuna was good, and cooked correctly. The fish entrees do not come with sides, so we added one each. He got the Moroccan Mechouia which was decent I suppose, but he got it without peppers due to allergy so I won't comment on that. I, however, got the Kamut & Freekeh Risotto with wild mushrooms and kefalotiri cheese which ended up being a huge disappointment for me. This was not risotto, at least not what I'm used to. I was told after, that it's an \"ancient grain\" risotto - whatever that means. It was the consistency of corn with some cream in it. I was expecting a thick creamy risotto... if you're looking for that, don't get this. I did not finish it, it was basically a bowl of beans.   We finished with Baklava ice cream for dessert, which was exactly that, a scoop of ice cream with a piece of baklava on top. We chose to get a shot of espresso to dump over top of it which was delicious.   In all, the bill was $190 before tip. For this atmosphere and that price, I would have expected to be wowed or at least satisfied, but I wasn't. Im not sure if I'll be back any time soon unless someone suggests it."}
{"text":"seasonings are strange taste. seafood ok"}
{"text":"My friend and I were very excited to try Poro's as it had just opened recently but we weren't all that impressed. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Probably one of the coolest restaurants in Pittsburgh. The fresh fish market is also a nice touch. So from an environment perspective I definitely give it a 5 star.   The food on the other hand was over priced and nothing special. We asked the waiter what he recommended and he said the crispy skin dorade was the most popular item on the menu so we both ordered it. Overall I think the presentation was nice but it was missing something. Definitely not worth $32. We also started the meal with the 3 dips: roasted cauliflower hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzatziki. They were all fairly good but the tzatziki was by far the best. It had an excellent taste and it tasted very fresh. Factoring both taste and price I would only give the food a 3 start rating."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.  1. Service behind the bar is terrible.  We sat at the bar for over 20 minutes before getting asked for our drink order.  It was 4pm... It was our small group and 7 other people... Bartenders were too busy chatting in the corner.  2. Way overpriced for what you're getting.  Sure the \"quality of ingredients\" is higher than some of the cheaper Greek places downtown, but the taste is severely lacking.  Just a fancy mermaid atmosphere does not warrant these prices.  3.  I don't even understand how this is possible at a GREEK restaurant, but the hummus SUCKS.  Tasteless, chunky, where's the olive oil??? Ugh it's just upsetting and borderline offensive.   Step your game up Poros... I'll be going to the Simple Greek instead."}
{"text":"Tandoori oven cooks fish to perfection at this beautiful spot in Market Square!  Different happy hour every weekday. Seafood displayed market-style if you want to pick your own.  I will be visiting again very soon!"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident when searching for seafood. It will be a regular stop when in Pittsburgh. The fish was incredibly fresh and the tzatziki with fresh vegetables was some of the best I have ever had. Great service and an \"interactive\" menu allows you to customize your meal."}
{"text":"Arrived a Poros and was greeted by the host. Requested outdoor seating and was informed it would be an hour wait.  I responded that I noticed an open table on the front patio and the host informed me that the people who were seated at that table were sitting at the bar???   I didn't understand that but responded ok. He then went on to LECTURE me about how it wouldn't be fair to seat us outside when the other party had waited an hour to be seated.    I really could have done without the LECTURE!!!   Once we got to our table the waitress was very professional and friendly. Offered a good suggestion on wine since we weren't as familiar with Greek wines. Our food was delicious from start to finish. The waitress suggested sharing a salad because they were big and that was a very good suggestion.  After the incident with the host it was a good experience, but management would be wise to better train their host staff since they are the first impression of the restaurant and can set the tone for your dining experience."}
{"text":"I loved the decoration and the ambiance, I think it'll be perfect for an office happy hour. But I wasn't impressed by the food at all! The portions are very small compared to the price and the seafood doesn't come with any sides. I ordered scallops and I got 4 scallops on am empty plate, looked sad!"}
{"text":"I have never wrote a restaurant review before, but I had such a terrible experience at this restaurant. I literally was not served because I was wearing a green shirt and celebrating St. Patricks Day ( I was not drinking folks and completely sober). I will not be back and neither will my group of friends that frequents Market Square weekly. There are much better bar/restauraunts surrounding that area. I would highly recommend Il Pizzziolo, Nola, Vallozzi, to name some favorites."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming a favorite! Twice in the same month, and both were excellent for both food and service. The only thing I would change is to take care of the small flies (related to the indoor plant)."}
{"text":"Poros looked awesome from the outside. I was a bit confused as we stood waiting for someone to approach me and seat me. When they finally did I was in awe at the decor. It's a nice atmosphere but it's kind of out of place amongst Market Square casual dinning places. I don't know if it's a bad thing or a good thing but I was excited to give it a taste. I had a crispy skin Dorade fillet and it was filled with flavor. It's crazy how good that was but somehow the side dish Tabouleh was kind of the star. I was mad when it was gone. The staff here are very attentive and proactive to your needs. Next time I visit this place I will try the baklava ice cream as it sounds pretty amazing. I don't know how I ended up giving this place a try but I'm glad I did. My friend loved the lamb and it was packed with flavor."}
{"text":"Absolutely sublime and excellent service.  Wines by the glass included Israeli, Lebanese and Greek; which was nice to deviate from the usuals. Beet salad was yummy. I ordered the branzino and it was delicious. Chef was approachable, pleasant and no attitude. One of my new favorite restaurants of the world"}
{"text":"First time eating here and the food was excellent.  The waiter was well informed and walked us through the various options and cooking techniques.   The food and service were all very good.  The location in Market Square is a plus.    Pittsburgh has come a long way and this is just another good place to check out."}
{"text":"Really nice decor with the windows open to the covered patio tonight.   A great night to dine under the stars.   The place was busy with 8 fish selections, 4 shell fish from the Meditareannean or North Atlantic.  There is also some lamb on the menu. the drink and wine menu is extensive with wine from many countries that are not usually on a restaurant menu. Our waitress was helpful with the menu and wine selection.  We had a white wine from Greece that was balance with a little more acid that went well with our selections.   We stopped by later, after a an evening meeting to just sample some apps. and have a glass of wine.   The Shrimp Saganaki that I chose was very good with nicely cooked shrimp that was plumb and tasty.   Poros has the potential to be a fun go to spot in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Not bad! Came here end of October for dinner with my aunt and my coworker. The drinks were really fantastic and the bartenders were all very kind and terrific. I like that you can order smaller portions here too if desired. I was flying home the next day and I couldn't have a lot of food in my stomach, so this was perfect! The hummus was yummus!! I had the Daphne themed drink, if memory serves me. And I had a small portion of salmon. It was very fresh and tasty, I just wish it came with couscous or something. I would come back here! Also the decor was just gorgeous and very modern. The bathrooms are downstairs though which can be daunting if you drink too much, lol. don't trip on the stairs!!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this restaurant and wanted to get a gift certificate for my daughter's Birthday. BUT.... They don't mail gift certificates. You must come in I've order gift cards all over the USA and had them mailed to me or the party I was giving it too  Really limiting your audience. Glad I don't live in California but the inconvenience of driving in paying for parking isn't worth it  Lots of other good restaurants in the city"}
{"text":"Dined at Poros in June and really enjoyed it.  The atmosphere is upscale yet relaxed.  We sat outside on the patio since the weather was good.  Our server was super helpful since we hadn't dined there before. She was knowledgeable about the menu and had good suggestions on both drinks and food.  For appetizers we had the lamb kibbeh and sashimi of tuna nicoise. Both were delicious, although relatively small portions. We did the whole fish for entrees - branzino and dorade, one chargrilled and one a la plancha.  Both fish were very tasty but we liked the chargrilled one better - the garlic/shallot sauce was really good.  For sides we had the Moroccan mouchia and roasted potatoes.  The mouchia was great, the potatoes were potatoes, nothing to write home about but they were fine.  For dessert we had some sort of ice cream (I don't remember it so it must not have been mind blowing - also was small, one little scoop).  Overall, it was one of the better meals I've had in awhile and we're looking forward to going back (this weekend, in fact).  Reservations are probably a good idea and it's not cheap so maybe more of a special occasion dinner.  The bill wasn't bad though - between us we had 1 cocktail, 1 glass of wine, 2 beers, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 a la carte sides, and 1 dessert for around $150 including tip.   We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is beautiful, new, clean. Great overall look and feel. Too bad the food and drinks suck! Note to ownership or management fire the chef. The flavors are boring and the presentation not worthy of a second visit. Not one of the 6 small mezze plates were good, not even the horiatiki salad. Had 4 of the 10 signature cocktails which all sucked as well. The Sangria has charred fennel. If you like black char floating around your sangria and the taste of fennel then go for it. The greek donut dessert not good as well. Been to many greek festivals in my day and never had loukumades so heavy and hard.  Here is my conclusion: the owner spent a zillion dollars on building this beautiful restaurant but will lose it all if he doesnt fix the food and drinks. I suggest maybe even  a prayer at the local greek church."}
{"text":"Came here for our 20th anniversary. The waiter was knowledgeable about the food and attentive. As with any restaurant, wine  was overpriced, but they had an excellent selection to choose from. My family being the foodies that we are, hubby and I enjoyed the ahi tartare. Hubby seemed to enjoy his entree, not really sure because he really didn't rave about it. I ordered the chicken. But hey, I'm a southern girl. Anything with okra in it and I'm doing the happy dance. Being the southern girl that I am, I gushed to the waiter about how awesome my meal was. On the way back to the hotel, hubby mentioned that I didn't really care for it. My answer, it's a bit over rated if you ask me. Then he began to take it personally. I'm not saying that you shouldn't come here. If you like trendy places to see and be seen, it's the place for you. I'm an excellent cook. During gatherings people put in an order with me, like I'm a restaurant, yeah right! I go to enjoy something that I myself can't do."}
{"text":"Ate here last evening and had the lamb shank on the restaurant week menu - fabulous! Also the sommelier did a great job with the wine pairings."}
{"text":"This restaurant was all over the place for me. My initial impression was amazement as it is very clean and trendy, with a nice touch of upscale. Cocktails were very tasty and appropriately priced. Not a ton of selection with the mixed drinks and beer but a decent wine list. We had no issue with the service throughout the entire stay but it did strike me that the wait staff was working very hard to make it seem upscale and fancy instead of letting it just happen. I felt like portion sizes were actually appropriate for the price, which was a little pricey, but when at a nicer place it's to be expected. My main problem was that the food was all okay. Just okay. Nothing that made me want to call up family and friends and say \"GET DOWN HERE NOW AND EAT!!\". Instead, I left thinking \"That was an OK\" meal. From the price, atmosphere, and borderline awkwardly stiff wait staff, I really was expecting to be more impressed. I don't think anything was wrong with the whole place, but for $10 less you can get an equally tasty meal in many more places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Poros is an excellent addition to the Downtown and especially Market Square restaurant scene.  I haven't worked downtown for about a year and I was pleasantly surprised to see even more restaurants being added to Market Square, especially those that have outdoor seating and spill out into the square.  It adds a touch of European ambiance to the Pittsburgh streets.  The decor at Poros is straight out of Greece and their fresh fish selections and choices of preparations are wonderful.  I've been there for lunch several times now with friends and on business lunches and I will go back as much as possible.  The 2 or 3 course prix fix lunch is a good deal and the selections are delicious.  The starter plate with pita and whole grain bread with hummus, tzatziki and baba ganoush is a delicious starter.  The chicken schwarma is delicious as is the grilled salmon.  Every dish comes with a choice of a grain salad that differs each day.  They are light and refreshing and a tasty but not heavy side.  True Mediterranean fare.  You will not be disappointed choosing here and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Always risky going to a place the first week they are open.  But we did.  And well, it wasn't great.   Drinks at the bar before dinner:  Gals behind the bar were completely inattentive.  Very off-putting.  VERY unfriendly.    Look and Feel:  I live in SF, but am from Pitt, so was happy to see a Loungy-foodie place open up.  Nice atmosphere, great lighting. Hard to find the actual front door tho, ha!  Food:  Overall, pretty good. Some good ones and some stinkers.  Decent wine.    Service:  We noticed there was lots of congregating by the staff.  At the kitchen, by the bar.  Maybe  because it was new they were getting to know each other, but it seemed like they should have been looking in on their tables.  However, once we got outside, GREAT recovery by guy and gal (wish I could remember their names! They were friends and super fun!).  They saved the night with friendly, solid service.    Doubt I'll be back.  Get the girls behind the bar some proper manners and social skills.   They're really what I remember from this place as the main takeaway.  And that's too bad."}
{"text":"My son took me here for lunch as part of his holiday gift to me. Both of us were overwhelmed with the atmosphere here. They have fresh fish laying out on ice as you enter.  It was a beautiful day and many were dining outside but we stayed indoors. We have a friendly and knowledgeable waiter who helped explain the menu to us. At lunch they offer either a two course or three course prix fix menu. I opted for the two course one since we both planned to have dessert later. Their specialty today was arctic char which is a cross between salmon and trout.  For my first course I chose tzatziki and substituted the roasted cauliflower hummus for the baba ghanoush that normally comes with it. Those dips came with regular and pita bread to share. My son ordered the chicken shawarma which came with a grain salad.  We loved the tzatziki dip. I thought the roasted cauliflower dip was just okay but once I got into it more I liked it a bit better.  When we got our main courses we both had the grain salad. His chicken looked like a giant gyro but he told me he loved every bite of it. I enjoyed the arctic char a lot and it was just enough for me. The place wasn't too crowded and my son told me it was a better option to come for lunch. They do not offer the prix fix menu for dinner and as always you are paying a bit more for the same food.  I really enjoyed my experience here and was thrilled to have an opportunity to eat in a new Greek restaurant by Market Square."}
{"text":"Nice tapas, great fish, and several yummy vegetarian options. The service was excellent, and not a terrible price for the location and ambiance."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to POROS. I love the fact that the food tasted home made and was not overly salted !!!! It was healthy and tasty . Would love to go back and see how other dishes taste ."}
{"text":"This was an excellent choice for dinner before a show at the Benedum! I chose this place to use my OpenTable gift card and was not disappointed. One of the hosts called a few hours prior to the reservation to make sure we were still coming in, which I thought showed care and taste. My mom and I ordered the baba ghanoush to start which came with pomegranate seeds on top, grilled bread, and pita. The pom seeds were a great touch, I just wish the baba had something a teeeeeny bit extra added for flavor.  On to the entrees: I ordered the 6 oz. Lavraki which did not disappoint. For those who haven't had it, it's a lighter Mediterranean fish that is excellent if you choose the preparation as chargrilled. It came with half a lemon that was also seasoned which I drizzled over the fish. The only thing I wish our server had mentioned was that it comes with orzo pasta, as my mom and I ordered a pilaf to share. Two grains were not necessary.   My mom had the lamb campanelle and the lamb was super tender and flavorful.   I shall certainly return (only when someone else pays! haha)"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner celebrating our baby moon. Boy oh boy am I glad that we started out our trip to Pittsburgh at this restaurant! The seafood was fresh the service was good and I really loved the decor. We ordered the snapper and the octopus as a starter. The next time in Pittsburgh I would certainly check this place out again."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here so this is a review for their bar. I would never been able to eat here anyways considering everything has fish.   My friend and I ordered cocktails at the bar. I had the white wine sangria and my friend had one of their cocktails.. can't remember the name. We loved the ambience and the friendly bartenders. We wanted to order a second drink but it was a little pricey. Drinks range from $8-14.   We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Just another Big Y restaurant with decent food and horrible service.  Way overpriced for what you get. Be careful when ordering or a piece of plain grilled fish can easily top $50. Our food was ok but under seasoned.  I had to get up and search out the manager to get some salt and pepper when our server was no where to be found. The deck is nice in good weather but why they leave the sliding doors completely open in hot/humid weather is mind boggling.  Please allow people who want air conditioning an option.  Like all other restaurants in the Big Y group, wine is 3 1/2 to 4 times retail, so you're paying $100 for a $25 bottle...pay their high corkage fee and you're still ahead."}
{"text":"Not that impressed.  The Cobb salad was drenched in salad dressing and the service was awful. I had to ask to have my water refilled 3 times separate times.  And the waitress only filled mine, not the entire tables. Wtf. Choose another restaurant."}
{"text":"We ate here last night, had reservation. It was a bit odd at seating, a nice maitre d' took us to a table that the man who had been led to a table by another maitre d' before us was already sitting it. Our maitre d' admitted confusion but did not ask the man how he came to be seated at that table. It was clearly the best table in the place, so makes you wonder what happened next to side window and back window facing ice skating. We sat in another open booth. Mixed drinks were quite small. Waiter was friendly. Two of our 3 entrees came seriously uncooked. Waiter apologized and brought back to kitchen. One of us spoke to our maitre d' who apologized, waiter asked us if we wanted more wine and then maitre d' came over and asked same. Waiter less friendly after that. So we thought these 2nd glasses of wine were on the house--not so. Food was good, salmon appetizer, grilled shrimp, wonderful duck baklava, fish, potatoes all good, cauliflower was great. Our $8 dessert order of donuts was very good and on the house, maitre  D' came to tell us before we ordered. Guess we could have ordered desserts but we were stuffed and didn't want to be piggy. Quite expensive but overall good experience, seating question at beginning left a strange/not so good impression."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the excellent food. The service was terrible. The server was indifferent and didn't bother checking on us or asking if we wanted a drink refill. The only time he was prompt was when delivering the check! Our appetizer never came and when we asked we were told that things were busy. Well of course considering that it was a Saturday night in downtown Pittsburgh! But that doesn't excuse the bad service or indifference. Further the salad that we ordered came after all the entrees and that too after asking about it twice. No matter how good the food, service is usually what makes a restaurant worth going back to! I doubt if I will go back to Poros. There are tons of other great restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh that are able to balance the food, service and weekend crowds! They will get my business over Poros any day."}
{"text":"Valentine's day dinner. We went to Poros for Valentine's day because I had a birthday coupon. The space is very open and blue lighting gives it a nautical feel. We were seated right away and our server Steve was very friendly and helpful. We each order a specialty drink Athena's Dirty Pillows and the Kapanos. Both very very good.   We started off with the grilled octopus mezze and it was tender and fresh. Very good.  They sell fish by the pound for whole fish and the ounce for fillets. They have 4 different preparations; chargrilled with a lemon sauce which I had on a whole Branzino, Tandoor roasted with Indian spices and yogurt sauce which my partner had on the black bass, and the a la Plancha pan fried with lemon sauce we had on the scallops. They were all very good but the Tandoor roasted was the star. The seasoning penetration was much deeper than the other preparations.   We had the charred broccoli as a side. It. Was. Amazing. I would never usually mention broccoli but this was transendant. Charred broccoli, glazed walnuts, pickled onions and bacon. Wow. It shocked me with how good it was.  We had the poached pear with panna Cotta and the baklava ice cream. The pear was just ok but I would suggest the baklava ice cream.  The only thing that I have a question about is that the entrees came with couscous and sauces but it was not packed in my doggy bag. When I pay 26 for a plate I want to take all my leftovers and it offended me that they probably just trashed it."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and amazing food. What a Pittsburgh gem we've found here.  Top 5 meals of all time!  Must try!"}
{"text":"Ok  amazing food. Had rhe sword fish and scallops were amazing. The atmosphere is very trendy and has a great open kitchen.  Becca offered great suggestion.  It was all very good with good portions."}
