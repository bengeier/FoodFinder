{"text":"Dropped in last week to pick up dinner and was I surprised!  FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!  Don't be fooled by the fact that this food is kosher.  It's better than \"regular\" Chinese food.  We ordered Lemon Chicken, LoMein Beef, Crispy Beef and Won Ton Soup.  All choices were great, especially the Won Ton Soup which was out of this world. Do yourself a favour and drop in!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a scam! $42.00 for veggies basically. 

We got home opened the bag and the containers are full of veggies only and not even full. The Chicken balls where false advertised compared to their photo on the website.  

I called the store back and mentioned the lacking portions, they mentioned to me they weigh their food and you only get 8oz of meat, it does not state on their website you get 8oz of meat. The owner was so rude he said that's all you get a generous 8oz of meat that we weigh on a scale. 

Also inconvenience they only take cash so I had to find an ATM to pay for my order also. They gave me the old excuse our debit machine is being switched. 

STAY AWAY if you want good quality, taste and portion. SAVE YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"They overcharged us (for already expensive food) and the food was mediocre at best. The flavor was OK but really not wonderful for the price."}
