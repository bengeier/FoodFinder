{"text":"This is a ghetto looking Chinese restaurant - the exterior is unremarkable, the interior is a smattering of randomly placed tables with plastic sheets, and a karaoke machine hangs off a column. At the entrance is a pile of King Crab heads on some buckets, and an \"Ambu-lans\" is parked outside.  A Godzilla-like sound emanates from the kitchen every so often. This Thursday night, it wasn't terribly crowded, but we ordered the maggi style lobster tail which came back with plenty of meat, and the rest of the lobster was served to us steamed. I don't have that much Lobster on the West Coast so I forgot how much 4 lb of lobster was. The softball-sized Lobster claw said it all. It is HUGE!  The free range chicken was good too. The menu is entirely Chinese so I'm not sure they're all that interested in growing too fast. I don't know how well they would scale up anyway...but this is clearly still a well kept secret that I'm writing the first Yelp review."}
{"text":"My parents come here a lot. It's pretty much their favourite Chinese restaurant. I have been to their old location once and found it rather blah. However, I went to their new location yesterday and although the interior was still rather ghetto-tables with mismatched chairs and random pictures on the wall, the food was really good.  The Food: I ordered the sweet and sour pork along with a bowl of white rice. This is pretty much my staple. I really missed this when I was living in Taiwan and I can't get enough of it now and it was really delicious! There weren't any bones and the exterior of each piece was crispy. I detest the ones that are too soggy or fatty. So in my books, this was definitely a score. We also ordered fish belly with noodles. This was also very good. The fish belly tasted good and the noodles weren't too soggy. Two ladies even came over after their meal to ask us what it was because they thought it looked really appetizing. The free range chicken was tender and flavourfull. The last dish we ordered was some vegetables cooked with garlic. Always a good choice as long as the vegetables are fresh and it was. The total for the 4 dishes including a bowl of rice came up to about $29 which is very good considering the portions are quite generous. The best thing is that, I can usually tell after a bit if MSG was used in the cooking because I get a funny feeling in my stomach, and I didn't detect any MSG after eating here. So, well done!  The Place: As mentioned before, this restaurant is your typical Chinese restaurant. It is quite small, with only about 3 big round tables and 3-4 small square tables, and it's quite obvious that the owners didn't put any effort into its decor. It's definitely not a place to bring a first date, but it's somewhere to go when you're craving good Chinese food.  The Service: There was only one server there and she was an elderly woman. She was very  nice and polite. I think my step-dad knew her well because although she came to take our order, he insisted on just writing it for her instead. Also, I don't think she speaks English, but you can always just point to what you want on the menu (if you can read it). The dishes came out in a timely fashion so no complaints here.  The Verdict: Come here for good Chinese food, but bring a friend who can read Chinese OR your Google translator because the menu is all in Chinese."}
{"text":"The food here is alright, but the service is pretty shotty. If you come with a large group, even after pre-ordering your meal ahead of time, you can expect to be here for 3 hours (and no, it's not like it was a 10 course meal). There is only one cook and one waitress.   That being said, the food here is pretty cheap and often the things that sell for market price (i.e., lobster, crab, oxtail) is a good deal. They only charge something like $7 for labour.   If you're okay with slow service but decent prices and decent food, then you should come here.   I come here every once in a while because my parents love it here."}
