{"text":"This place is amazingly GOOD!  I've been coming to this place since it opened. The owner's are great people very kind and humble. The food is amazing, they started off with making burgers and now they have a full menu. This place is is our get away from the kids."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The best burger ever South Phoenix. I remember when they had a stand on 15th ave near Southern Ave and I am excited they now have this new location. My favorite is the Cubana,  the patty is grill to perfection and the flavoring just right. This a must stop burger joint if you are craving a delicious burger. And their Papa Asada (grill potato) smother in butter,  sour cream, cheese,  and bacon OMG that is another beast of deliciousness. Not only is the food delicious but the service is very friendly and make you feel very welcome."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat in Phoenix, I've been out here 6 months already and just found out about \"el Humadero\".     I ordered a papa with carne asada grilled onions and cheese also got a quesadilla de asada.  My favorite thing about this place is everything is cooked \"al carbon\" aka \"charcoal\"  I get the hassle of cooking with charcoal but these folks seem to have it down pretty good. If you're in the area or even if you have to drive 20 minutes to get here, it's worth it.  When I was younger I used to drive from LA to Tijuana to get some good tacos. I know I'm not the only one that's done that for sure. Definitely gonna recommend it to my co-workers and I'll be back regularly, there's a few things on the menu that I want to try out."}
