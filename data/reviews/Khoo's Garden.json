{"text":"My wife and I went here last night and had a great meal food and service was good can't wait to try the buffet for lunch will be back"}
{"text":"My wife and I have visited this restaurant many times this Summer. We have eaten from the menu and recently tried their buffet. What a surprising treat. Everything was flavorful and fresh. What a real find at a very reasonable price. Planning on returning very soon next week. Keep up the good work.  If your looking for a pleasant eating experience,   try Khoo's. Very nice people and super friendly."}
{"text":"After hearing a coworker express how good Khoos was on several occasions I decided to give it a try last night. It was really disappointing. I called and ordered the Amazing Chicken (13.50) and an eggroll (1.95). When I picked the food up the guy at the counter was really nice and the place looked clean inside. When I got home and opened my bag everything was covered in grease. The eggroll was literally sitting in a puddle of oil in it's small bag and it leaked all over the rest of my food. It was inedible. The Amazing Chicken was just okay. On the menu it says it's lightly breaded. It was definitely more breading than chicken. The sauce didn't have any heat to it as indicated on the menu and was really sweet. I ate one plate of the Chicken and threw the rest away. After reading the other reviews it seems like the food is better when you dine in, unfortunately after wasting $16 I'm going to pass on returning."}
{"text":"Love this place! We go often for the lunch buffet and although a smaller size buffet, the quality of food is great and the staff is always soo friendly. Crab rangoons have real crab in them. I don't think I've ever had them so delicious ANYWHERE ELSE!!"}
{"text":"Used to go here when it was the Great Wall and always had amazing chicken because to me it was amazing.  Under new management and named Khoo's Garden the amazing chicken WAS NOT amazing.  Rather than pieces of chicken it was thinly sliced and by the time it was cooked became quite chewy and actually hard to cut.  The egg roll while hot when served was actually dry.  My dining companion had the shrimp and scallops but our server had no idea what vegetables it came with.  Another girl said it would be baby corn, carrots, broccoli, onions and snap peas.  Well there was no corn or carrots but there was zucchini.  At 1:30 in the afternoon we were the only 2 people in the restaurant the entire time of our visit.  Sorry to say we won't be coming back, although the prices were good, the food was not."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time under this management.  The food was great.  We both loved our dishes (his was beef & broccoli and mine was Singapore rice noodles).  We saw several people ordering the General Tso's chicken; it looked amazing.  You get very large portions.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can only rate the lunch buffet since that is all we have tried, but it is a 4.5 (I decided to round up because as I write this, I am ready to go back).  The only reservation is that the selection was pretty small.  On the plus side to having a smaller selection is that the food always seemed to be fresh.  I have been to the buffets that claim over 100 items, but some of those items might be sitting forever.  With a small selection means more turnover so fresher food.  The selection was pretty good as well with your standard noodles, rice, eggrolls, Rangoon, soup, but the other dishes include a veggie dish, pork, general tso, chicken and shrimp, chicken and broccoli, beef, and fish.  Even though not a large amount of dishes, a good variety in the protein department.  For me, all the dishes tasted great.  The only item I was a little disappointed in was the spring rolls.  They were decent, but I have had better.    Anyway, overall you can't beat it for 7.99.  FYI, not sure the ages for kids but one of ours was half off and the other free."}
{"text":"We went there for the lunch buffet. I was not impressed with it. The food was barely lukewarm. The crab Rangoon was the best thing on the buffet-very tasty. The other food was OK."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a good Chinese restaurant. We were so thankful to find this place when driving by. I love the one waitress. She is so cute and sweet. We're always so happy when she's our waitress.   We love to get the egg rolls every time and occasionally get the pan fried dumplings which also never disappoint. The general tso's chicken is our favorite and is very good. I didn't like the general tso's shrimp or pepper steak as much. The portions are large and can be shared.   They also have a lunch buffet during the week only. I'd love to go try it sometime. Come check them out."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place as it's been quite awhile since the North Hills has seen a Chinese buffet. We were greeted with an overpowering aroma of incense and seated promptly. We went up to the buffet and boy was it tiny! 2 soups, rice, noodles, a tray of fried selections and a few entrees: General Tsos, Kung Pao chicken, chicken with broccoli,sweet and sour chicken and pancakes. No salad,no fresh veggies etc..... Once we got to our seat I was pleased to find complimentary hot jasmine tea and wonton chips with dipping sauces. Sorry to say these were the highlight of the meal and the tea was only thing that was hot. Good service but I will not return."}
{"text":"This new family owned restaurant is Amazing! The owner is a very well known Professional Chef who has worked in many high end restaurants all around the World and recently moved his family to Pittsburgh. The food is The Best Chinese Food I've EVeR Had! My family came to visit and we had a Great Time here. The owner's wife taught us Chinese and she was Soo Sweet and explained that all of the family helps out including their 7yr old daughter and Teenage son. I highly recommend eating here regularly! They stayed open during 4th of July evening just to accomodate people while every other restaurant was closed. The old Wall that was here was not Nearly as Good as these new owners with food Or Customer service. I want Everyone to know how Great these new owners are! :D The portions are Huge and the food is Delicious and made with Beautiful Presentation! Certainly a 5 Star Cuisine Restaurant hidden in the surburbs of Pittsburgh & I'm Thankful that they are here! EVERYTIME WE GO THERE THEY TREAT US LIKE FAMILY! Their beautiful daughter helps me decide my order and they always accept my special requests for extra sauces & other stuff! They Really APPRECIATE their Customers and work EVERY DAY ANND ALL HOLIDAYS just to accomodate Everyone who may be alone or not want to cook during holidays! ***Angels in My Book!***;D"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now.   First time I ordered takeout...ma po tofu. It was lacking flavor in my opinion. Not only that, but I ate it around 5pm and roughly a half hour later I fell asleep and didn't wake up until the next morning, feeling awful. Not sure if I received an msg overdose or what.  I later talked with a friend who raved about her meal when she visited, so I decided to try again.  I ordered a vegetable spring roll and kung pao either shrimp or tofu, I can't remember. This meal I had at the restaurant and was significantly better and I did not lose a day to sleep. I felt fine after eating.  I just ordered takeout again.  Veg spring roll and vegetable egg foo young. The spring roll is a bit undercooked inside and the egg foo young has a great variety of veggies, but is a bit overcooked and mushy.    All in all, this is place is just average.  The staff are SUPER friendly but the food is a bit inconsistent and I feel the prices are too high for the quality.  Because it's new I am hoping they can get it perfected. I pray they replace the carpet. And because it's 2 minutes from my apartment, I will go back, but only when I don't feel like driving further to a few of the better spots in the area."}
{"text":"Chicken and broccoli is pretty good but was a bit over priced based on other restaurants in the area. I also had general tap and wasn't too impressed"}
{"text":"Horrible treatment , the spring roll has a poorly cooked shell and was greasy so I ate the cabbage interior only by peeling the outer area off  Then I noticed a black hair.   Yuk  I showed management and she was very defensive saying the cooks wear head coverings   She could have cared less"}
{"text":"I stopped here for takeout a couple of weeks ago.  I liked the garlic chicken and amazing chicken.  My wife didn't like the chicken with mixed veggies, but she didn't get to try it fresh and had to reheat it, so that may not be a fair assessment.  If I had any criticism of the food it would be the way that the chicken is cut for the amazing chicken, it's too thin.  The cornstarch makes it tough after frying and difficult to cut.  It would be a bit better if the chicken were a little chunkier.  But it tasted fantastic.  I will definitely go back to try something else."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food. My go to meal is Beef with Broccoli. I ordered this for pickup recently and it was hands down the WORST I have ever had. The meat was chewy. The broccoli looked horrible! There was so much sauce that it was like a soup! Also, the sauce tasted like a bad watered down gravy and not like anything that I have ever had before. This restaurant is close to my home, so my experience with my meal and having to leave this review is unfortunate. I will not eat there again!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  Khoo's Garden replaces the greatly-loved Great Wall.  Khoo's Garden kept the same d√©cor, but is the food as good as the Great Wall?  No.  Actually, the food is better.  I had the Ginger Chicken, which was flavorful, and they certainly didn't skimp on the ginger.   Tea was excellent.  Service was friendly.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday  with my father for lunch.  We were originally trying to head to one of our stalwart restaurants, The Great Wall, whenever I noticed a new sign over the building.  Since it was still a Chinese restaurant and they had a sign in the window advertising a buffet for 7.99 my dad and I decided to give it a try.  The interior of the restaurant looks much like it did in it's previous incarnation with an addition of a tv and then a buffet.  It has ample seating with both booths and tables and with the tinted windows always seems a bit gloomy inside.  The lunch buffet here actually wasn't ready whenever my father and I walked in although we were promised that it would be in 5 minutes.  After only a short time our waitress came over to us and let us know that the egg rolls and soup were ready and that we could help ourselves.  I did just that and grabbed an egg roll, crab rangoon and some hot and sour soup.  All of it was pretty good and the crab rangoon was one of the best that I have had recently.  By the time that I was finished with all of that, the rest of the buffet was ready.  I ended up trying some General Tsao's chicken and some garlic pork as well as having a spring roll.  The sauces from the dishes seemed to be on point and I liked the taste of them.  Their General Tsao's ended up being a dichotomy of good and bad though.  I loved that the chicken in it was super crispy.  Oddly at the same time it seemed over cooked.  So the great crunchy outside also came with a chewy inside that was hard to get through.  In the end I left restaurant satisfied and with a full stomach.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While their buffet is certainly smaller than most Chinese buffets at the same price point, I felt like it made up for it with better quality food."}
{"text":"Pretty good! They have a lovely interior design, attentive staff, and variety of foods.   My personal favorite was the crab rangoons. The tea was hot and fresh. The portion sizes are plentiful. I came on a weekend and it wasn't too crowded which was nice. The prices are reasonable too. Loved the staff, super friendly, ??????? Will stop by more when I visit my hometown again!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is under new management and totally different. They had a small lunch time buffet that had a nice assortment of American Chinese. You can't beat the price for a lunchtime meal. Under 8 bucks. The service was attentive, restaurant was clean and it just felt so different from my last trip there. I will update my stars when I actually try a meal and not just a buffet."}
{"text":"While the buffet selection is small and the decor sparse, the food on the buffet really stands out. The ingredients are light and fresh tasting (crisp carrots and broccoli), no heavy, salty, oily asian messes here.   While the egg and spring rolls are hit or miss, the crab rangoon is definitely a hit every time. I probably would just go here and eat a plateful of rangoon, vegetable lo-mein, and mushrooms and leave very happy.  We only go to have the buffet and the several times we have gone we have enjoyed the offerings each time."}
{"text":"I noticed that Khoo's Garden was under new management (and they have a nice new sign, too), so I figured I'd give it a shot for lunch. I noticed that they had a lunch buffet, but elected for takeout instead since the buffet was small and only had a handful of choices.  I ordered beef and broccoli with an egg roll to go. The counter staff was polite and friendly, and the order was ready quickly. Unfortunately, the quality of the food was pedestrian at best. The egg roll was good, but my entree was flavorless, and the beef was quite chewy. I was actually quite amazed at the utter lack of seasoning and flavor in the brown sauce.  I'm hopeful that Khoo's Garden can turn it around, and use higher quality ingredients and boost the flavor of their dishes. If they do not, there is no reason to go here when there are other high quality Chinese restaurants in the area like the Sesame Inn and Empire Palace."}
{"text":"Was not a fan at all the only good thing was the crab Rangoon and egg rolls but you can't screw that up. The tofu I ordered was watery and flavorless I really wanted to like this place :("}
{"text":"This is a BIG improvement over The Great Wall, the previous restaurant in the same location. Don't make the mistake of thinking it is the same place."}
