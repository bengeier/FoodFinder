{"text":"So its not on the menu yet but they now have a deep dish pizza that is to die for! Im from chicago, I know good pizza, they nailed it!!! 
Not to mention the people who run this place are truely nice, genuine and just all around good people. Even if ya walk in there in a bad mood youll leave smiling. :-)
Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza and the staff. You feel like you're at home with family and friends and sharing a pizza. Go there for your pizza fix."}
{"text":"Nasty pizza! Don't eat here! I picked it up for take out and when I went to eat it all the toppings including the cheese and sauce slid off! Never had that happen in my whole life! Bring back Di Carlos and go back to Ventura you pizza butcherers!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! I don't know what those other people were smoking (or not smoking) but this is some of the best pizza I've had since, well, New York. The customer service is almost beyond compare and the food, well I'll put it this way: I bought a medium hoping to share a bit, but once I started, I couldn't stop. I've gone back a few times and have never been disappointed... Keep up the good work guys. :-)"}
{"text":"Worst pizza on the west side. I joined yelp so no one would waste their money on this place like I did. No flavor, way to greasy and over priced."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time today for lunch, we were the only ones eating and took over 40 mins to get our food, i ordered the Italian sub, and was a few bits into it and found a large blonde hair! It didn't seem to bother them once i told them i found a hair in my food. The food didn't have the flavor we were expecting.  I wish i could leave no stars, horrible food, took forever to receive our food. I Dont recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The Pizza and Garlic knots are delicious, but what really makes this place are the owners. There are dozens of options for pizza in the area but since we found this place a couple months ago we don't go anywhere else. It's locally owned by a great couple. If you haven't tried them, give it a shot. I guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  The crust was crispy ( exactly how we like it), ingredients were fresh, and the owner was super nice to the kids.  In fact, they have board games to entertain families while they wait & the kids had a blast playing Chutes & Ladders.   Outstanding food, clean restaurant, and reasonable prices... Love it1"}
{"text":"It seems like it doesn't matter that your pizza slices came out the oven you still rather burn your mouth trying to eat it then wait and be patient to let it cool down best pizza from the west valley all the way to the east north and south highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Arizona! I drive by 5 other pizza places to get to Johnny B's because it's fabulous.
Karris turns every pizza into a masterpiece!
They have awesome sauce and use fresh veggies...we love this pizza!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. First issue was that it took over an hour and a half to get the pizza and the biggest issue was that the pizza sucked. I ate one piece as did my boyfriend and we took one look at each other and threw the pizza away. I would rather eat a Totino's party pizza for every meal every single night for the rest of my life before I ever attempted to choke down another slice of what this place attempts to call pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Wonderful service. I was warned ahead of time the woman was busy and by the sounds of if, she was by herself I assumed. So we patiently waited. I got a phone call asking if I wanted a free two liter for the wait, I couldn't pass up the offer.  When the pizza got here it was hot, fresh and delicious. The woman was super nice on top of.  Will be my go to pizza delivery!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for Delivery, the online process was easy, they were busy so my delivery took long, but the girl that delivered my food was very nice and friendly. As of the food, the pizza was Ok, but unfortunately I was expecting better. My husband didn't like it all. I ordered garlic knots and they were burned and tasted horrible. I really wanted to like this place, but I don't think I will ever eat it again."}
{"text":"Tome counts on  Famous Johnny B's  to feed us at least once a week.  We know our food is made with love here.    We have witnessed how much they care....  And never have to question the quality of our food."}
{"text":"Please keep my review as a recommended review yelp. If you look below you added mine and many others to a non recommended status and many of us gave this business a five star rating??? We need restaurants like Famous Johnny bs in this neighborhood and yelp reviews are a large part of how to make that happen. Please contact me yelp if you have any questions about my review. I'm just another guest who loves the pizza and have seen many pizza place fail. This is a winner. Help them and post these reviews accurately."}
{"text":"Best pizzeria EVER...PERIOD!  Great atmosphere, great people, great food!  My family and I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, my first time here and I am pleased! Thin crust, just the way I like it. Didn't have to wait much perfect!"}
{"text":"Ordered some food for delivery, my first time ordering from here! The pizza was honestly some of the best I tasted, and the wings were perfect. The Philly Cheese steak sandwich was excellent and cooked perfectly. I am really happy that I found this place, and I plan on visiting soon as well as ordering in the future! Will recommend! Excellent, fast service and really good, hot food! Thanks for the wonderful service and delicious food! Great deal too!"}
{"text":"I consistently get great pizza's here. I prefer Johnny B's over Bianco's any day and there's never a long wait like there is at Bianco's. It's truly a small hidden gem in the southwest valley.  My kids love the place as well, and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. I used to make my own pizzas from scratch at home as I have a pizza oven and truly love pizza, then it got hot out and I tried this little place hidden over between Red China caf√© and Albertsons and got hooked! The only thing I wish they advertised is that they can put butter and garlic on the crust. I had a couple pies from here and didn't know until someone ahead of me ordered with it and was like, what?! Yea, I want to try that! Now I'm hooked. Even when it cools back down I'll still get my pizzas here since I don't have to spend hours preparing and cleaning up afterwards at home. My favorite is pepperoni, sausage, garlic, and basil with the garlic butter crust. I took my Dad here for fathers day and he's not a big of a fan on garlic so I told them to go easy on half the pizza ( and lots of garlic on my side of course) which they did and he loved it! If you are very selective with quality ingredients as well as being as picky as myself just let them know and they will make it exactly like you like it. I also have had their calzone and sandwiches and they are very good as well."}
{"text":"Been traveling through the southwest and stopped in for pizza.  Had a sausage and mushroom.  Excellent.  The music was 50s style and fun to be there.  Would come back."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! fresh ingredients and a crispy crust made it delicious. The wings were good, not amazing but very good overall. This place is family owned, and did customer service right. Can't go wrong with this place, it's probably the best pizza in the west valley! 10/10 would recommend a friend."}
{"text":"Closed. Out of Business too bad they did not make it. Too much competition. 4 stars when they were open."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Granted, I didn't have the pizza. All of my order was undercooked. I had a Stromboli which was uneven and uncooked in places. I also had the garlic knots which lacked garlic and again, were undercooked in places. Probably won't return, have to assume the pizza is at the same level. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best pizza! Started in Ventura California as Tony's Pizzaria, then the owners son brought the same amazingness to Arizona. Yum!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Johnny B's pizza! My husband & I have been going here since they opened. We picked up dinner tonight because it's our cheat night meal.  Our favorite is the Johnny B special which is pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, onions and mushrooms. The sauce is so fresh & tasty. I usually always get the same thing each time especially if it's my favorite. Today, I branched out and also tried a pizza with spinach, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. So delicious!! The crust is crispy & delicious. Overall, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered XL pizza, wings, and garlic knots. The pizza is thinner than I expected, but it was a flavor explosion! Really really good! The garlic knots comes with a little container of marinara sauce... Let's just say I would drink this sauce if they'd given me more... yummmm. The wings were ok. They don't have a deep fryer, so the skin never gets really crispy unless you char them... But that's more of a preference thing for me. Overall, will definitely be back... Staff was SUPER FRIENDLY!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in no beer for pizza and wings. Window boasts Happy Hour. Wings are baked just to let you know. But!! Great pizza. Cooked very well!"}
{"text":"I went there two Saturdays ago, they were closed. There was a sign on the door that said \"will open at 4pm\". It was 5PM and guess what, still closed. Any business that dicks their customers around like that, will not get my business. I will NEVER go back, they lost me."}
{"text":"We went to the one on Indian School and Dysart. The customer service was excellent and the music was perfect. Johnny the chef took his time, and it was definitely worth the wait. The pizza and wings were absolutely amazing! The sign is small, so just look for the \"pizza place next to Albertsons\"."}
{"text":"Salty, over-priced,  overcooked and dry crust, and very little cheese. I love and miss pizza from back east, this is definitely not even close! Most places do a 16\" LG but not here, LG is 14\".  Just not a good value. I'd get Bruno's, Palermo's or even Gus' before I ate here again. Too bad, I had my hopes up based on the reviews."}
{"text":"I make Johnny b's my regular stop every day off.  Everything is good.  I love the pizza, calzones, garlic knots, Italian sandwich, meatball sandwich and stuffed mushrooms.  If you have never been here you must try it. The staff is awesome and are great with kids. My kids all made there own pizza and loved it.  Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, but it was awful in our opinion. Very disappointed.
My husband said, \"Wtf? 50.00 for 3 medium pizzas? Red Barron and hot pockets are a fine aged wine compared to this pile of crap.\"
One daughter said, \"Nasty.\"
My son said, \"Frozen pizza is better than this.\"
Another daughter said, \"It tastes like cardboard.\"
My Grandmother said, \"Eh. It certainly was not the best that I have had.\"
I felt as though it had no flavor and it was extremely boring. 
*$50 included 2 sd salads and ranch dressings."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The crust was crispy and exactly the way we prefer, without being dry. The fresh mozzarella was the stand out winner. I am now obsessed with figuring out what is in the divine sauce, I have never tasted one so delicious. We ordered the meat lovers and pepperoni, both were a close call for a favorite. The meat lovers came out slightly ahead with its large pieces oh ham and sausage. This is a small locally owned pizzeria that has quickly become a family favorite."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them a second try but...

Update** I have tried to order here a few more times and although it's during the advertised hours there's no answer. Once on a Saturday I tried to order pick up at 8pm and was told only for delivery. I quit trying to give them my money. I'll go to Barros since they clearly don't want my business."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. But honestly bacon bits are not a good substitute for bacon on a pizza. So yeah. Whatever."}
{"text":"The best local pizzeria I even to in a while. We had the Med oven baked chicken and garlic pizza with garlic butter drizzles over it. The pie was made to perfection! We also had the cheesy garlic knot that came out superb. The customer service was excellent and the environment was warm and inviting for a family to hang out."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizzas, they were great! First time here and it wont be my last. Met the owner Johnny, his a cool guy and the rest of the staff was very friendly.  This place is family owned, has great quality food and a welcoming environment. If your in the area and want some good pizza, you have to visit Johnny B's Pizza."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Famous Johnny's recently for the first time. It was in the evening a little close to 5 and we had the hardest time trying to figure out what to out on our pizza. I love pineapple and pepperoni my husband however likes pepperoini with onions and olives. We had ordered their large and split it down the middle (I mention this because the one of the workers had said the next time said she will fix our order the same way but a little different).

When asked about about the crust, we wanted it crispy and it was just perfect.

We really did enjoy ourselves. The environment while small was also very friendly and you could feel the \"happy family\" presence. 

We did hear the back story of Famous Johnny's and it was quite interesting. 

Way better than Gus' Pizza! 

They actually do care for their community. We will most definitely be back"}
{"text":"Really good food and very friendly staff. I go here regularly and look forward to pizza night!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch combo, can't wait to bring the family back for dinner!  Pizza was excellent."}
{"text":"We love this place and drove 30 minutes expecting them to be open at 7:00 pm on a Monday. No note on door. No message when we call. In fact, it says their voicemail isn't set up."}
{"text":"No answer.  Voice mail  full,  i suspect that it is out of business!"}
{"text":"Really good service and nice atmosphere. The pizza was just good/ok, there are better and worse around town.  The pizza rolls were good, as were the wings.  Not great, but good. 

We'll probably shop around to see what else is out there."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Amazing Staff! The pizza is really great not one single complaint. Honestly one of the best pizza places I've ever been to. Must try! Not soggy, not greasy"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good. They try really hard to be a family orientated restaurant.  However, their seating is limited and very uncomfortable.  Had the garlic knots which tasted good but they weren't baked all the way through which meant they were doughy in the bottom.  The pizza was decent, I couldn't eat more than one piece because it really didn't care for the flavors.  Also wasn't a fan of their drink selection, no Coke or Pepsi here. RC is their cola."}
{"text":"I've actually never heard of this place until two awesome guys came to our floor at West Valley Hospital came and handed all our staff free pizza and soda! The pizza was hot and delicious! I can't wait to check out the restaurant and try more food! Thanks Johnny B's! :) you've definitely made some new fans tonight! 

-5th floor night shift staff"}
{"text":"stopped by today thinking it was the old place but was pleasantly surprised I tried the pizza and it was good.       hope you guys make it and are here for the long haul.  I  will be back again thanks.  from chris b to johnny b."}
{"text":"Pizza Rolls and wings.


Very small place, but the pizza rolls, wings, and side salad  were good. We read that Johnny B's can get very busy in the evenings, so we decided to visit  mid-afternoon. 

Our server was very friendly and offered suggestions, since it was our first visit to Johnny B's.  I enjoyed the pizza rolls and the wings, and my lunch companion said the side salad was good.


I look forward to going back and trying the pizza and other items off the menu."}
{"text":"Yum! Great pizza and garlic knots from a family owned and operated business. The owners were there running the place and I much rather support a local small business than a corporate chain. The place smells amazing the second you walk in!! All the people that I picked up food for raved about the flavor. Garlic knots to die for!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in a couple weeks ago only because of the sign that said New York pizza. I wasn't a fan of the pizza place that was here before the ownership changed. However, this was a wonderful surprise!. The sauce on the pizza was very flavorful. A perfect balance of tangy, slightly sweet, and spices. The pizza crust was exactly how I'd expect it to be when someone says \"New York Pizza\". It was thin and crispy, soo yummy. I would've taken a pic but it smelled so good when it came to the table that I literally inhaled my pizza lol. We chatted with Johnny and his wife, they are super sweet and down to earth. Definitely will be returning for some more pizza soon!"}
{"text":"This is a small place, so don't expect to be able to seat a large party. The food is great and all of the ingredients are fresh. The staff is friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, family had a blast! The owners are very welcoming! I love that they get the kids involved. Just the fact that my kids love it ensures that we will definitely be back real soon. Go give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very, very good. However, be prepared to wait, and wait for quite a long time. I ordered two large pepperoni pizzas, a Stromboli, stuffed mushrooms and wings. With tax and delivery not including tip I spent $87. That being said, the food is definitely worth it. The pizza was thin, flavorful and delicious.
The garlic rolls and accompanying sauce, (although a little watery) were absolutely fantastic.
The stuffed mushrooms were very good and you can tell that they are using all fresh ingredients.
The wings were good, I will ask for them to be crispy next time.
As a small business owner myself, I know how difficult it is to run a well oiled machine. They've got the amazing food down, now just to speed up the process a bit.
By the way I would've given five stars had it not been for the almost 2 hour wait."}
{"text":"Based on yelp friend reviews, I really was looking forward to trying Famous Johnny B's and brought the family along. I really struggled with what to rate the visit because there were some positives, but some real negatives as well. First and foremost, service was great. Like five stars great. The young lady who served us and made our dinner was very outgoing and aimed to please. She appeared to be on her own but was giving 100% effort. We also enjoyed her company. Now for the setting, we really liked the seating options of being able to watch our pie being made. They had a large television showing a kids movie that my daughter really enjoyed. Sadly, these positives were overshadowed by a couple of terrible facts that I just could not get past. Fact 1) The restroom was horrible. It smelled foul and was very dirty. Fact 2 (and most important)) There were ants all over the counter. We first noticed them by the soda fountain and then down near where we were going to dine in. I tried to have the family get past it and enjoy the meal but there were just too many. We quickly ate our appetizer and took the pie to go. I should have told the young lady about the issue but was concerned she would have been embarrassed and I did not want to make her uncomfortable.  As for the food, as mentioned, we started with their version of garlic bread. I personally thought it was good. Problem for me was the dipping sauce quantity. There was not very much of it to dip with and the containers holding the sauce were tiny and awkward. It really looked like the containers were possibly candle holders. One was shaped like a heart. Just kind of odd.  Lastly, the pizza we ordered was the extra large pizza with ricotta and pepperoni.  I thought the pizza was ok. It had a good quantity of toppings but could have had a little more sauce. Overall and as mentioned, I struggled in reviewing B's based on some good and bad experiences but just can not get past having to leave a restaurant over ants.  

I really should give one star for feeling forced to leave due to ants, but the great service to me is worth two stars."}
{"text":"Stuffed Bell Peppers, Garlic Knots, & Stromboli all good. Pizza wasn't cooked correctly, not very good.. Very inconsistent."}
{"text":"I love Johnny B's pizza, you have to get a combo for sure.  Plus Johnny is a super cool guy.  Arizona is lucky to have this place for sure.  Don't listen to the other reviews, I have eaten Johnny B's pizza's for many years.  Trust me, you can bring your kids here and eventually your Grand kids here as well.  Great place to bring a first date.  You will not be disappointed.

FYI: Johnny B uses Real Mozzarella Cheese on his pizza's hence a little bit of oil on top adds to the flavor."}
{"text":"Revising yesterday's review of one star.  I received a sincere explanation from the owner that explained the issue was with the  independent online ordering company.  As a past small business owner, I appreciate the timely manner that the owner responded.  This business obviously cares about their reputation.  I am giving them another chance and will be trying their pizza soon.  I am confident that this business will succeed in Litchfield Park if they pay this much attention to their customers."}
{"text":"It tasted like the pizza I got for lunch in middle school. The dough consistency was a bit like cardboard, the sauce had no flavors that really made it stand out and the cheese was so basic, it's like it was all just texture, no actual taste. The cheese bread was like someone cut a loaf of bread in half and just put a stick of cheese in the middle and microwaved it. 

I feel like if they invested in better ingredients, they could actually have a decent pizza. Customer service was nice, cheese bread was free since it was my first time. It was unfortunate that I had to throw it away though."}
{"text":"Tried to visit this place today at 12:00 pm...it was closed?? No sign, no explanation? Drove all the way there because their hours said they were open!"}
{"text":"Unique new york style pizza, but not exactly new york.  Lots of flavors, crisp crust.  Place is very simple with really not much atmosphere, but the pizza is very very good."}
{"text":"I order online for wings. They came in a timely fashion. The app was a lot easier to use than calling."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and wings here. We had a cheese pizza, pepperoni & sausage pizza and Canadian bacon/pineapple. Everybody loves the pizza and the wings. The crust is very good. We will come back to try their sandwiches and calzones. They have games and coloring books to entertain the little ones, which is very thoughtful."}
{"text":"I just got a call from the supposed owner telling me that my delivery was going to be late. Like twice the delivery window. This is not OK. I was waiting for food. I think you should not take online orders of you can't do them. Hire staff! Poor customer service."}
{"text":"I really like the service here. The food was good as well. I loved the Garlic Bread! Freshly made to order. Owner was very courteous and inviting! He answered all the the questions and more, and offered his advice on what's best. Spoke with the owner, it looks like he's got tons of Pizza experience from previous location out of state. I definitely will be back! Thank you again for service and great food! Keep it up :)"}
{"text":"WOW this was the first time my husband and i ate here, the Calzone is fantastic & a huge salad and their famous Garlic Knot Rolls...AMAZING!  Fast friendly and wonderful service!  We really enjoyed the food. Making this a family favorite.  We actually had it delivered and exceptional serivce!  Thanks Johnny B's!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love the pizza! The pizza is so fresh and flavorful. 

The staff is super friendly. I like that there are fun activities to keep the kiddos occupied like coloring books and board games."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the west valley, family owned, and HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"This place will harrass you privately, and threaten you for bad reviews. THEY WILL ALSO complain to Yelp, to have bad reviews pulled down.  This is the second posting of this review, changed a bit so as not to offend a certain special needs community. It was not meant to harm anyone, or single out anyone. I use colorful speech. I feel embarrassed that the owners feel the need to harrass people over reviews.  There is nothing famous here, you are better off buying and burning your own pizza.
I could not finish but two slices of this burnt out pizza pie. 

Onto the original review, slightly changed....

I was very sad to see \"the old pizza joint\" leave. I walked in after the change of ownership and chatted with one of the owners. She is very easy to talk to, she is very excited about getting this place off the ground. 

As I sat and talked with her, I noticed all the pizza's coming out of the oven were burnt. Respectfully I asked her to not burn mine, and take it out before the cheese and toppings burn. I guess she didn't catch it in time, I ended up with a burnt pop tart flavored pizza. The other owner tried to convince me that it was not burnt. My definition of burnt differs from his. Burnt cheese and crust that is charred and blackened is burnt. Maybe if they switched to \"blackened pizza\" it would pass with flying colors. The other owner said she could remake it, but it already took a half hour of me sitting there waiting for the first one. That would have been an hour, and I doubt she or he could figure out the new oven. What a waste of time, I ended up chucking the pie.after two miserable blackened pieces. It is that bad when a yellow lab sniffs it and walks away. I guess I have one up on the dog, I at least attempted to consume it. I hope they sign 6 months leases, as i suspect they will be shutting down in a hurry."}
{"text":"I saw all the positive reviews and was expecting a lot. When I arrived, there was only one person working there and he frantically took our order. Apparently his partner and other employees weren't around. I felt really bad for him. The pizza itself wasn't bad but definitely looked like it was rushed. The place itself looked pretty unorganized and random stuff was lying everywhere. It was likely an off night but hopefully the owner or manager might read this and address the issue. Not a bad pizza, but the process seemed broken the night I went. Again, the food wasn't terrible. I felt bad for the lone employee and hope they can get things more organized."}
{"text":"Gonna keep this short for once... Came in and grabbed a slice. It was fantastic. Dough is tossed, ingredients are fresh and flavorful, and the ambiance is super casual. 

Met the owner too. Seriously one of the nicest guys. He was hugging customers, high fiving some local high school kids, and inviting people to a charity event to be held at this spot. It was to raise money for a little kid with cancer. The kid was just a customer - I don't even think he knew him beyond that. 

But back to the food... It's excellent. Superb example of New York style pizza via the west coast. I like this place a lot. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in the middle of nowhere! !! Family owned and operated. ..this is a true diamond in the rough! !!...traveled all the way from Los Angeles for business and stumbled on this amazing pizza spot! 10 stars here!!! Cant go wrong."}
{"text":"We attempted to try this place on Monday. However they were closed at noon when we came to try it out. No sign saying they were closed, no voice recording on their phone line, and nothing updated on their website. Not sure if they are closed down or what, but it is very ghetto to run a business like that. Their website doesn't even list their hours. Yelp shows they open at noon and Google says 11:00am. Uhhh it's 2016- you should have a better run website with accurate information and atleast a voice recording of hours of operation and if you are closed for some weird reason, out that on there too. Get it together. We went to NYPD instead where we should have gone from the get-go. Never fails to impress."}
{"text":"True gem in Litchfield Park, the pizza here is just simply fantastic. It's more of a NY/East Coast style pizza, the sauce is just so tasty and the dough is cooked perfectly so that it's just crispy enough. Very reasonable prices, friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere, it's just a very chill place to sit and chat and eat some wonderful pizza. If you like Domino's/Pizza Hut/Papa Johns, this might not be the place for you...but if you like a more authentic east coast taste in your pizza, you NEED to try this. My husband and I both got the daily special, it was a great deal. A HUGE slice of cheese pizza, half a sub, and a drink but there are other options too. We ended up taking a whole pizza to go after we finished our lunch! We have found our new neighborhood pizza joint."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and great customer service.  This was our first time but we will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Omg! Delicious! We have struggled to find good pizza for the two years that we have lived in AZ and now we have finally found it. Super authentic, not fast food tasting at all. We love the pizza and the owners are great. Very friendly atmosphere and great food. Definitely a must try for everyone. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, really good pizza. I am actually very picky about my pizza and sauce flavor. Honestly, one of the best pizza I can remember having in a long time! So good!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. We had the Hawaiian and the ham tasted like actual family-dinner quality ham. Some of the best Hawaiian I've ever had. The owner brought us free rolls with balsamic dip and veggies with ranch dressing. The atmosphere is very cozy and there were lots of grown up table games and coloring stuff to keep kids occupied. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"Place is very small, but we went mid-afternoon, so not busy. Pizza took awhile, but was delicious. Personally, I did not care for their sausage, but I am used to sausage with a little spice. This tasted like regular breakfast sausage. Manager is very friendly. Side salad was very good."}
{"text":"The food was great, pizza rolls were delicious.  Only docking the one star for the wait.  There was only one person working which slowed the food production on a Friday night.  This place is really best for take-out, I would not recommend eating here as there are only a couple of tables.  Best to call I your order 30 minutes prior and taking it home to eat."}
{"text":"From Cali seeing some negative reviews the only way I could subscribe this place friendly great food and awesome pie you need to judge for yourself some people right crap for their own personal gain I definitely would come back again thanks for the great pizza !! Tell ur hubby I'll see him the next time I'm in town keep doing your special recipe ."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, we ordered salad, garlic rolls and 1/2 & 1/2 pepperoni and vegetables 12\" for 2 and we still has some left over. Amazing service, very personable, they make you feel at home and like you have known the for a long time. Sauce is made daily with only fresh ingredients, what else can you ask for?"}
