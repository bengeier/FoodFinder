{"text":"Usually, I really like the food and service here, but last night was a big disappointment.  When my order was delivered, I thought one of the items was wrong.  When I called to have them fix it, they first argued that it was right, then finally insisted the item was right, but they had forgotten the sauce.  They made no apology, and were uninterested in anything they could do to remedy the situation.  I finally gave up.  The item itself was fine, but a little different than usual.  It particularly suffered without the sweet and sour sauce for dipping.  One of the other items we tried this time was lemon chicken.  The chicken was good but the lemon sauce was horrible.  We threw it out.  If only there had been sweet and sour sauce too!"}
{"text":"I read the previous reviews and I just had to add mine. We've eaten from Kingston 3 times via orderit.ca each time the food was awesome and came in a timely fashion.  I won't say they can't improve because lets face it, everyone can. Their worth my 4 stars though if you're looking for tasty chinese food."}
{"text":"Had a Combo Plate and Lunch Plate between two of us.  Tasted a little off but we thought really nothing of it.  A couple hours later we both got the runs and a twisting knot in our stomachs and a crappy after taste in our throats.  But, it didn't stay down through the evening.  Had food poisoning before from Seaspray Chinese and this was the same,  Be careful what you order from Kingston Chinese.  Kinda had it with Chinese places in this Area, FOOD is WAY TOO SKETCHY and a high risk of TOMEIN Sickness."}
{"text":"This joint is as expensive and yucky as any Chinese place you'd find at a mall's food court.  You get a huge quantity of very poor quality and tasteless junk.  For the same cost, you might as well walk 100 metres east and get a great meal at Tropical Thai.  Don't make a mistake and eat here.  Run away - fast!"}
{"text":"I have order 3 times from this place. 1st time when they first opened was ok. Had the usually chicken balls, egg rolls, fried rice and wonton soup. 2nd time was worse, same food, lesser quality. 3rd time, tried different food, BBQ ribs tasted like dog, veg chow mein was unflavored and filled with gelatin, wonton soup had a broken lid, that leaked into the bag. Each time I bought the soup, it was of lesser quality. Store looked clean I guess. Their light switch was gross. Don't waste you time with this place. Safe your money for Feathers, The Green Dragon or The Beech Tree.  I think I feel sick."}
{"text":"This is the cheapest Chinese restaurant I have ever go to ! I order a general toe chicken and rice. $5.99 plus tax with a drink. Open the box it has 3 piece of chicken. Thin slice!!! This is a joke! I didn't bother to say anything."}
{"text":"What was I thinking not checking Yelp reviews before ordering from Uber Eats????!!!! This place is absolute s*^# . The beef and broccoli dry as a desert. Broccoli looked stale, I'm even scared to think where the meat came from. Ordered Kung Pao chicken and they sent over a bowl of carrots loaded with celery and 3 small pieces of chicken. It didn't even have the peppers or cashew nuts. It was a pail looking dish. Not authentic AT ALL. I called to asked them to send me the proper dish and the owner asked me what I expected for $8.95. He said I ordered a cheap dish and why should I expect more give this place zero stars if I could. This place needs to be shut down because the ridiculous owner argues instead of trying to fix the problem with his terrible food."}
{"text":"Found the fried rice greasy and the BBQ pork really dry and tough.  Sea Spray down towards Main is much preferred for Canadian style Chinese."}
{"text":"justeat.com brought me this one for delivery. i'm glad it did i loved the wonton soup and chow mien more than most spicy dishes are good too cheap and good chinese only minor thing was i ordered spicy shrimp and they came with shells and heads still on. i'll remove those later, havent eaten them yet but ill let ya know"}
