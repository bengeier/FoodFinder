{"text":"Mark us down as more California expats who have been confused for years why it's so hard to find a restaurant-style Mexican food in this valley that lives up to our standards. Not cheapie take-out chains, not little specialty places, and not restaurants that need you to be tipsy before you taste. We've had very good sit-down meals in CA, AZ, UT and CO, but NV has let us down pretty consistently over the past ten years.

El Mescal lives up, though. We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"We usually get our dinners from Bite Squad and this is our first go at El Mescal... WOW  fantastic  My wife got the Arroz con pollo and I got the fajitas Cancun......we are gonna head next week to try it out in person!!"}
{"text":"The place is very nice , super clean and the restrooms nice and clean , i love their bar . Costumer service was acceptable the food was ok but i believe that they can do better. Little expensive but no too bad"}
{"text":"I would not expect what lies inside from first glance. Delicious authentic Mexican food, lively staff and a clean restaurant is what is behind the empty looking establishment. I had the carne asada which was super flavorful and tender, rice is also full of flavor and fresh made chips with salsa is par. I got a coupon on LucyVegas.com for half off!"}
{"text":"this place doesn't even deserve a star period. food comes very skimpy, prices are way too high for what they serve you, tacos were weak, burrito wasn't even a burrito just tortilla with meat. horrible place to come, you should come here if you want to WASTE your money and time"}
{"text":"Best size and price for margaritas in the area. 

The food was amazing, and the portuon sizes on the plates are enormous. This is my new place for mexican food. The service is great and friendly. 

I'd recommend the medium Cazadores Margarita and the 3 tostadas ceviche plate and or the Carne Asada combo for one (we had the carnitas chimichanga)."}
{"text":"Came here New Year's Eve and was immediately seated and greeted (in Spanish! They spoke in Spanish most of the time, and then clarified in English right after). Paublo, the owner, made sure you were happy with the salsa and chips. I could not get enough of the marinated cabbage, it was so tasty! Full service bar but I had a coke, a real Mexican coke! They also had Pepsi products too. My husband had the pork shank in the sweet mole sauce, which wasn't candy sweet... but delicate and smokey. It was so good I was dipping chips in it before I added more cabbage on my chips! The tortillas were in a warmer with a hinge lid, which I think is fantastic because I always forget to put the lid back on and they get cold or gummy (fresh corn or flour tortillas). The rice and beans are really good, plates came out hot (we were warned! I just like hot food to be hot). I had shrimp fajitas, with whole mushrooms, onions and green peppers. It has the most amazing glaze type sauce. Nothing was too spicy, everything was really quality and they make you feel like family. Less then 40 bucks for an amazing dinner. I regret not having the fried ice cream, make sure you clear a good 2 hours because the portions are huge and the dessert is beautiful."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The ambiance was perfect. The air conditioning was perfect.  The staff were very nice. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well all the orders was all screwed up there's alcohol pictures all over but no liquor license. Service really sucked won't go back there ever again"}
{"text":"Three of us went and thought it was awful.  We didn't enjoy any of it and barely touched our plates of tacos, enchiladas, burritos, rice and beans.  I actually got sick that night.  Don't know if it was from the food or not but we won't ever return."}
{"text":"Good attention BUT HORRIBLE the food, I asked for a veggie burrito and it was like a can vegetables taco... horrible, I ask for veggie beans and it give me allergy.. that means had animal fat... so disappointing... the micheladas are very good tho.."}
{"text":"As a fellow Mexican I hold Mexican food to a very high standard. 
This restaurant is both very traditional and as well  Americanized not a fan of there salsa that they give you with a chips. Feels like you're eating Tostitos salsa  just tomatoes but if you ask for something with more a little more and flavor they're very happy to do so and it is very good salsa. 

We gone there a few times and try to try something new. But some items like I mentioned before are not so traditional. 
Wait staff very very nice always try to see how they can make the experience better. 
Margaritas are good I build my own with not a problem. Great size in portions both in food and cocktails. 

Ordered  carne asada  very flavorful beans very delicious not like any restaurant. Very traditional ordered nachos not a fan kind of kind of greasy cheese not really melted."}
{"text":"First of all service was excellent.  Many check ins to see if everything tasted good or needed refills.   The staff was very friendly. 

As far as the food, started with cheese dip and it tasted like white Velveeta.  Poured my salsa in to break up the richness.  

Ordered the jalape√±o margarita which was good (fresh lime flavor and strong).

The chicken suiza enchiladas were the main course.   Everything tasted fine, but all elements were on the bland side: beans, rice and suiza sauce.  The sauce could have definitely been more vibrant!  It all tasted homemade, but a bump of salt would have went a long way.

Overall, I would go back, but to try another dish."}
{"text":"The food was not worth the price it was watery and uncooked. The drinks were okay. I think this place is too expensive! The dollar amount should be like $$$$ because they are highly costly and the food they are serving shouldn't be that much. Roberto's or other places has better tasting food at a cheaper price. The only reason they get two stars is because of the waiter was nice."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but nothing super special as there are a million Mexican restaurants out there with the same offerings. However, portions were huge and the drinks were too! Nice and heavy pours on the margaritas, and there was an okay selection of vegetarian options. Plus we got a good value for the price we paid. Quick and easy meal with a friendly waiter."}
{"text":"I gave one star because that's as low as I can go. I ordered a beef burrito. I got a $12 ground beef burrito with rice and beans . The burrito was soaking wet in a watered down sauce that was far from good. This place is over priced and misleading"}
{"text":"We had a chili relleno crispy style and a pork chimichanga  and it was to die for; their food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"The first Mexican Restaurant where the whole family was happy.  We all ordered meals that we normally do not and loved them - seafood and fajitas.  Plenty of chips and salsa. Service was fine. The music was not blaring. It was clean and roomy. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"We were traveling through and found this little gem.  The food was great and the service was helpful and kind.  The meal begins with chips and two kinds of salsas.  The dishes were tasty.  My son ordered a plate with three hard shell tacos.  The tacos were soggy from the beans.  I told her I needed new shells and she went back to the kitchen and brought back three freshly fried shells.  Delicious!

We ordered two medium margaritas.  They were huge.  The drinks were strong too.  We probably should have shared a small. 

Will look forward to returning here the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband and two daughters on Monday night. They have a huge menu and everything looked delicious so it was hard to decide what to eat. I finally decided on the enchiladas Suizas which were delicious. The chips and salsa were also really good. The salsa has a nice spicy kick to it. They also give a bowl of cabbage with salsa mixed into it which is really good. The restaurant just opened and is kind of hidden so it was dead when we were there, but the restaurant itself is really nice, clean and comfortable. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food.  Wonderful chips and salsa.  Enjoyed the clean friendly atmosphere and strong alcoholic beverages.  All I can say is Ole!!!"}
{"text":"Shhh! This little hole-in-the-wall is the best-kept secret for mezcal in Vegas. Illegal Reposado for $7/shot. El Silencio is $6. Los Amantes is similarly-priced. The food is great as well. There is a tangy slaw served with chips and salsa. Delish! El Mescal - don't change a thing. I'll find you a loyal following from the mezcal-drinking community...I guarantee!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, which is why I'd probably give it another try but the food didn't do much for me.  Salsa is just ok.... Could be the dish I ordered because I had a hard time finishing or eating it. Maybe it was too bland I don't know. But my husband cleaned his plate completely so either he was so hungry anything taste good or it's really that good. I will go back and try another dish and edit my review if my thoughts change.  It's worth a shot to try it out."}
{"text":"We love this place and eat there often but when we went today, they were randomly closed. The sign said they would be closed on Monday January 2nd, but today is Friday and they're not open! Very upset and confused as to why there closed."}
{"text":"Food was great for what Vegas offers for mexican. The cheese dip was delicious. The salsa however is very weak doesn't have the mexican style to it. Food was fast location was nice and clean. I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Bomb AF! Fire! Flame! Super scrumptious. Customer service was professional. Chips and salsa delicious. Authentic Mexican food. If you want to satisfy your taste buds and empty stomach. You better come here :) 100/5 stars WARNING: PLATE IS HOT AF but delicious food :) happy customer"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. It's a sit down Mexican food place so prices are in that range.... Full bar stocked off to the side of the sit down restaurant area. Also discount with yelp check in! :) walked over from fabulous freddy's since I was waiting for my car to be washed. Loved my lunch menu enchiladas, but they had a lunch special carnitas burrito for $6 that I'm kinda wishing I tried... In and out in 30 min. Fully saitisfied. I'll probably be back again. More likely if they maybe hav bar specials on nachos and tacos??? Hehe. Glad it's here."}
{"text":"Good meat flavor , big area for families. Tortillas , yellow rice home made taste. Try it I liked it."}
{"text":"Great service Pablo and all the staff are excellent. Have tried lots of things on the menu. This is our regular spot for authentic Mexican food. Live music on certain nights."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this restaurant in the past but after tonight we will not be going back. We were seated quickly and ordered. We waited and waited and waited. Two other couples who were seated 10 to 15 minutes after we were seated got their food. We asked twice about what was taking so long for fish tacos and cheese enchiladas. After another few minutes with no response other than\"sorry,\" we left and had a nice dinner elsewhere.  This restaurant is permanently off our list."}
{"text":"Had the steak fajitas and chicken fajita quesadilla and both were delicious! Staff was extremely friendly and I loved supporting an actual family restaurant in a town ruled by corporations. Will absolutely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've found the closest thing to my abuela's  cooking! The food is simply AMAZING! So authentic! I'm looking forward to exploring the entire menu! The only reason why I didn't give it all 5 stars is the ceviche but it's really not their fault. Evidently in Nevada the health department won't let them prepare it as is suppose to be. BTW, their chile verde is out of this world!"}
{"text":"We went there the service was terrible they never cleaned up the table we ordered Seafood enchiladas it said it had real crab it was fake crab I would never go back again"}
{"text":"1st visit and utilized a 15% off total bill. No liqueur license yet but coming in a few weeks.  Menu was are and had lots of choices.  Prices were fair and service was good. Standard chips and salsa with unlimited refills. Both of us enjoyed our meal and would definitely recommend this new las vegas restaurant.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican restaurant i have ever ate at , and i eat out at least twice a week and many mexican restaurants first let me start , when we first waleked in the employees were sweeping and and in the center of restaurant they sweeped food and trash in the center of the restuarant and when i meant trash take your full kitchen trash bag and dump it , and that is how much trash they had mound up in the center of the restaurant seem as they never swept for a couple months,  
Next i had a groupon and order my food and a $10 drink and gave waitress my groupon the same time and right before our food comes out the manager says my groupon is good not for some stupid reason . and the waitress and manager from the start were very rude .
I got up and gave $10 for the drink i ordered and did not drink , and walked out told the manager i would never be back and will tell the world how dirty his restauarnt is and how rude his staff is .....  and i will never be back ever.

I WILL NOT  EAT AT THIS DIRTY FILTHY NASTY RESTERAUNT!!"}
{"text":"Great $6.99 lunch specials & big lunch menu, 10am-3pm every day! I had the soft chile relleno which was very tasty! They also make a crispy one which sounded good as well. I usually prefer a verde type sauce but the enchilada sauce they put on it paired well. Rice is great! Beans are tasty & make an excellent dip. My mom had the enchilada & carnitas taco which were also good, though the crispy shell isn't homemade. My favorite part was the marinated cabbage they brought w/the chips & salsa. I'm going to try to make it at home. Chips & salsa were decent. Service was fantastic & the place was clean & welcoming. All & all, solid good food. I'll definitely come back for lunch."}
{"text":"Tried this place:  carne asada plate and a three item combo for two of us.  Probably won't return.  I hate to make decisions not to return based on one visit, but the only thing we liked out of the two plates was the soft relleno, that's why I say probably won't return.  I trust the early reviews of this place, more than recent ones.  They do have good, attentive service, but the food, generally, is overpriced and not very good."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we had a nice dinner. Everyone was courteous and attentive. The menu is a bit overwhelming because there are so many choices. The food was good but I thought it was pricey for the serving size. The margarita was great and was a nice size."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this family restaurant. We've been here many times and every once in a while we'll use a groupon. The owners are a young married couple. Very polite, and remember our usuals. When they see us arrive they always get my favorite salsa ready. I like mine extra spicy. The food has always been delicious and I like they're little touches that so many restaurants seem to forget, like not giving our kids a hot plate. Groupon or not, please check out El Mescal. I've seen too many of my favorite family-owned restaurants close while the franchise conglomerates that somply reheat food survive. btw, I should also mention they have a nice bar that have football viewing at every angle and live music...I think Thursday-Sunday, except when a game is on."}
{"text":"Been here twice and second time was due to purchasing 2 groupons at once but was only able to redeem one on my first visit.  Reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars is because I couldn't give it 3.5. The chips and salsa no doubt was delicious but the enchiladas and chicken burrito combo plates were ok and definitely not worth the price..each ranging about $15-17. I have also sampled the fajita and another beef dish that was more of a salad to him bc there seemed to have been more lettuce&veggies than beef.  Still, they were ok.  I do not see value in this place when it comes to food/drinks. Service was great, attentive waiters but that is to be expected when the entire place is only filled with 2-3 tables. Granted I was there about 2-3pm each time. The restaurant is pretty big and spacious with a great atmosphere. They seem to have a full bar that suits those who drink."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant and restrooms.  Chips and salsa excellent. For me the margaritas were too big but seems like a good value.  Food was reasonably priced and tasty, service very friendly.  Can't really find anything wrong here so 5 stars"}
{"text":"We were greeted with a smile and a greeting when we walked in. The music was perfect. We orderd our meal, the portions were generous. We would like to tell everyone that everything we had was excellent. The atmosphere was very comfortable. Come and support this Family Restaurant."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the very best Mexican restaurant in LV...this is it!  Truly the best choices and margaritas!!"}
{"text":"So one day I saw a Groupon offer for this place me and the hubby went for lunch it was amazing. Came again another day during dinner wasn't impressed. Just thought maybe a new cook or something. Came today and sad to say this will be my last time coming. My hubby ordered the menudo when it came it didn't even look like menudo, it was like a gray type of broth,  my hubby asked if they made it with chili she said yes and chicken broth,  ummmmm okay my hubby told them to take it away he didn't want it. I asked the girl if they had chimichangas she said yes and said they are a good size so in my mind it will take almost the whole plate because that's what I'm use to at other Mexican restaurants when it came it looked like a frozen burrito from the store that they heated up. The prices for the food they serve you is not worth paying full price for. Plus side of this place is they are family owned and the family is very nice. I hope they stay in business I think as long as they have Groupon offers and discounts on yelp that will bring the people in. Good luck I wish this business the best. Now to search for another authentic Mexican restaurant in Vegas,  I can't believe it's hard to find one."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Las Vegas for a week. We came to visit a aunt and were looking for a place to eat we came upon this place on yelp and said why not upon arriving the place was nice looked clean.  The service was amazing very attentive and helpful our server gave us tips on what to get the drinks were amazing food was delicious we will definitely be back again this place will amaze you with the food the drinks and the service."}
{"text":"The service is friendly,  chips and salsa are fantastic. I order the combo lunch #1 taco and enchalada plate. Generally when I go to a Mexican restaurant that is always my intro meal, I have to say I was quite impressed and bewildered but in a good way, the enchalada was superb and the taco to my surprise was good, it threw me off at first because seldom does a cultural Mexican restaurant use ground beef as the meat for a taco, that being said it was a nice treat and deviation from the norm. On another great note I left my debit card when I left. I went back to retrieve it they promptly had it for us waiting,  for great food and the honesty of the staff I say we'll done :)"}
{"text":"The food was not bad, but definitely not worth the price.  Roberto's has better tasting food at a cheaper price.  

The shredded beef burrito tasted exactly like the salsa, which did not work.  Should have stuck to traditional seasonings.

Rice and beans were tasteful, but so was the guacamole. 

Staff is friendly and prompt in attention, but we were the only ones eating.

I rated this place on the low side, due to the overpriced food.  The last three eateries in this same location failed for the exact same reason; overpriced meals."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great margaritas, great food, and the service is amazing! They are always so nice, like dining with the family! Check for promotions like groupon or Facebook check-ins as they are always running promotions."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!?!?! This place is so delicious! I can honestly say if I won the lottery I would move this gem to San Diego where I live! Being from Southern California I know good Mexican food and this place is hands down the best I have had!! Pablo and Luisa were so amazing and friendly! I got the chorizo breakfast burrito, my friend got the carne asada burrito.... The rice was so soft and fluffy, just like my grandmother and mother were in the kitchen! Great atmosphere and prices!! Oh and if the food wasn't enough, when I checked in here I got a 20% off the total bill!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually dine in after finding this little gem on yelp awhile ago, but too tired to wear pants tonight so ordered delivery.  Food was so good! It was a little less than hot but still warm and chimi was crunchy. This is by far, my favorite place...jut wish they had fideo soup with their ent"}
{"text":"Pablo was our waiter and he was very nice! The food was great and I specifically enjoyed the chipotle chicken burrito! The house margaritas were strong so worth the value! We would definitely consider going back to this friendly establishment!!"}
{"text":"There are many good Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas, but this is one of the outstanding ones. The menu has all the usual standards plus a a nice selection of specialties (the pulpo a la diabla - octopus in spicy sauce) was amazing. The complimentary pickled cabbage salsa is nothing short of addicting (we went through two bowls) and the generous-sized margaritas feature real limes and not that sickly sweet bottled sour mix.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable...and the staff is genuinely nice. Our first visit was on a Groupon, but we will be more than pleased to pay full price when we visit again very soon!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place. The staff is very nice and friendly. The food had a great taste, served hot, plate presentation was nice. I will eat here again and recommend this place to friends. I wish this business the great success."}
{"text":"The decor is simple yet very warm, inviting and comfortable.
Our food was very good and authentic although portions are a bit small.
 The enchilada suiza was DELICIOUS!
Margarita was strong and tasty.
 I am going back."}
{"text":"Authentic style... when we walked in they started speaking in Spanish, luckly our server spoke english!!  The chips and salsa are super bomb!  Entr√©es, dessert and the giant margarita's were also awesome!!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food for reasonable prices! The staff is also very warm and friendly!"}
{"text":"This Texas girl has finally found great Mexican food in Vegas!  I grew up in central Texas, lived in the border for a couple of years - so yeah, I consider myself to be a pretty good judge.  This did not disappoint.  

Complimentary chips were not housemade, but were flavorful and the salsa was homemade and terrific!  Nice side of marinated cabbage to start also.

I had the combo plate - tamale was excellent, sopita was okay.  Didn't love the base, but the picadillo was top notch.  My soft chile relleno (egg battered, very traditional) was awesome!

My husband, who is from the northeast, cleaned his plate of cheese enchilada and ground beef/cheese tacos.

The best part of the meal was the house margaritas.  Large, strong, and great flavor.  $9.99 for 32 oz.  would come back for this alone.

They have some great lunch specials, and a happy hour worth trying, too.  If we could single-handedly keep them in business, we would.   We will definitely be back, often!"}
{"text":"We didn't have great expectations of this place. We just were looking to try a new place out and purchased a Groupon. 

I've spent many Summer's vacationing in Mexico with my stepdad's family so I've had a lot of Mexican food in my life. This... By far... Was one of the BEST if not the BEST Mexican food we've had in Las Vegas! 

Service is on point, they are very attentive and thoughtful. Overall it's still pricey, but great for a date night."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight. We had never heard of this place until we saw an offer through Groupon. The place was pretty empty when we walked in. Service was still a little slow. However, everyone was very friendly and we weren't in a hurry. Everything that we ordered was really really good. My boyfriend and son loved it! We're in the neighborhood so I can definitely see this becoming a frequent stop for us. I have my favorite Mexican place that I've been going to for about 35 years. El Mescal did not take their spot in my heart but they are a close second!"}
{"text":"This s my second visit here and had to write a review. 
It's a family run business offering authentic, warm service, quality Mexican food in a clean environment. First visit, I had the carne asada, today I had the chicken mole. Both equally delicious.  The bathrooms are clean, fully stocked and lit up, that is important to me."}
{"text":"Came by for dinner and everything was excellent. The guacamole was delicious as well as the cheese dip- must try. The portions are rather large which isn't a bad thing. Service was awesome and they pour Pepsi- fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best waitstaff very polite and unrushed. BUT WAY WAY OVER-PRICED FOR THE AREA MOST EVERYTHING IS $ 16.95 and up...lowest priced item was the Cheeseburger @ $8.00...taco & enchelada beef was very poor mushy quality like taco bell with absolutely no taste or seasoning whatsoever. Tipped nice waitress $6.00 because of their pleasantness which made up for the expensive and dull food....sorry   wont be back, even if someone treats me...restaurant was totally empty...also    ummmm?????  ? You might have to go out of business like every single joint off the strip does...."}
{"text":"Came here to have lunch and a margarita with a friend. The mixed up our drink order, but we still enjoyed the margaritas. I ordered the fish burrito, which came enchilada style and was pretty good but a little pricey. The wait staff seemed nervous and unsure of what they were doing. However the decor is nice, open and there's patio dining available. Will have to return to give better review."}
{"text":"We ate there last Tuesday. Its in the old spot where Chuy's used to be. We were greeted by the friendliest staff members. I wasn't sure what I wanted to order, there were so many good choices. I got the Al pastor tacos, and my boyfriend got some combo for one, that had steak, chicken and shrimp. He said it was delicious. My tacos were very tasty! Everything we had was delicious. We will definitely be coming back! Food was authentic and delicious, staff was friendly and checked on us frequently."}
{"text":"Pablo Is Awesome, The Entire Staff Is Awesome This Is A Hidden Vegas Secret, The Best Part Is That It Is A Family Owned Restaurant And Their Food And Drinks Especially Their Margaritas Are On Point You And Your Family Will Not Be Disappointed. This Establishment Is How Small Family Businesses Should Operate By Setting The Standards And Leading By Example, One More Note The Chips And Salsa And Cabbage Dip Are Also Off The Hook."}
{"text":"Great food and that fried ice cream you need to come for that too .
Homemade style Mexican food 
Just like my abuela (grandma) makes its."}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot.  I love the chips and their margaritas are great!!!!!!! The food was good, but I only got 4 shrimp when I ordered camarones al mojo de ajo, which was a HUGE bummer.  I was actually  taken aback.  The Flan was ok, nothing memorable.  I will probably go back because the employees are very nice and welcoming. I won't go to eat, however."}
{"text":"My family & i love this place! We've come here multiple times, food is amazing and the waiters/waitresses are nice. The food tastes phenominal. Prices are good."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant, but it's a little on the pricey side.  We initially came for happy hour (which is only on beers and margaritas), so we ended up ordering regular entrees as suppose to discounted dishes we thought would be available.  Not much wrong with that, as the margaritas were on point, but I'm just saying that it had the potential to become a nice post-work outing type of place.

As you sit, you're served chips and salsa - the good kind!  Chips were warm and definitely done in-house.  With the salsa, the combo is addicting.  For our lunch/dinner, we ordered some of my favorites; chicken mole and ceviche tostadas.  The plates were large and really yummy!  It kind of reminded me of places in Old Town San Diego. The tostadas had an extremely generous portion of shrimp.. it was so fresh! 

While I was more than full and satisfied from this order, I would recommend to go during their lunch special (until 3pm).  Most things on that menu are about $10.  The mole is there, but I didn't see the ceviche. The restaurant itself is nicely sized inside AND outside.  Looks like it could be great for large parties.  Also, the staff/family who runs it do a good job welcoming you here.  If I had the authority to claim this place authentic, I would.

TBH, I'm conflicted because it's delicious food in a place ran with love by a caring family, but then the price hits and it's not that the food isn't worth it, but it's just not fitting.  I feel like a family-friendly restaurant like this should be a bit more affordable.  With it's price point, I would claim this as an occasion type place, but it's really more of a frequent go-to spot.  The $$$ and lack of a happy hour food menu are my only concerns with this restaurant."}
{"text":"My search for good Mexican food in Las Vegas continues. I wanted to like this place. Reviews seemed good, pictures looked nice, love finding hole in the wall places... But unfortunately I was disappointed. 

The service was pretty good. Waitress wasn't overly friendly and though she didn't check on us often, her fellow waitstaff did check up on us every once in a while to make sure we were okay. The restaurant was really empty on a Monday night at 6:30pm. Besides the birthday party they had of approximately 20 people they had maybe 3 other tables including us. 

The food was not my favorite. I'm from San Antonio and know good Mexican food. I was raised on Authentic homemade Mexican food so yes, my standards are a little high. When I saw menudo on the menu I was super excited and a fellow yelper's photo of the menudo looked to die for. So I asked if they had it on a weekday and to my surprise they did (for those of you that don't know, menudo is usually served on weekends. Kind of a brunch thing). I thought $13 for a bowl of menudo was pretty pricey but I just had to give it a try. Well, maybe I was too excited because when I tried it my smile went to a frown. First off it didn't look right and looked nothing like my fellow yelper's picture. The broth was thin and brown. Usually when menudo is cooked right the broth has a nice thick, orange-reddish color. That's when you know the flavor is there. The flavor was lacking in their menudo, I tried adding the onions, cilantro, seasoning, hot peppers and lime to the soup to get it to where I wanted it but nothing helped. I ended up eating a couple spoonfuls before deciding to just push it aside. $13 down the drain... I decided to try my man's chicken poblano. That too was nothing spectacular and for about $15 a plate, I'd expect better. The chicken was a super thin cut of meat. The rice was okay though, it had good flavor and was moist. But honestly for an average of $15 a plate and not even being on the strip, I'd expect phenomenal food. Oh and when they brought out salad they brought packets of ranch and blue cheese dressing to the table. They didn't even ask what kind of dressing he wanted for his salad and besides packet dressing at a restaurant that charges $15 or more for a dinner plate? That's questionable. 

Yeah we had a groupon for $20 but our bill still came out to a total of $44 plus a $7 tip for 2 people. That's kind of pricey in my book for the quality of food we received. 

I wanted to like you but the flavor wasn't there and the price is too high to frequent this place often."}
{"text":"Food, service, drinks everything was amazing!!! Definitely will be back :) yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 or 4 times and each time the restaurant has very little guests, so the atmosphere isn't great. We really like the Margaritas. The food is pretty good but I've had better Mexican, but after a margarita, the food tastes even better. Did I mention how we really enjoy the Margaritas? During my most recent visit with friends we shared the mushroom appetizer.  Not something I would typically order at a Mexican place, but I must say they were very tasty. I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were good. However, my friend's shrimp was delicious. I was surprised how fresh it seemed given the lack of patrons and not sure how fast they go through shrimp. Perhaps Sundays are their slow day. I hope business improves as we enjoy meeting our friends for good Mexican and really good MARGARITAS! hehe."}

{"text":"Yum! I got the spinach enchilada, which I liked a lot! Their salsa is great!!! My brother got the carne Asada burrito that he said was seven on a scale of 10, but for him that's like a 10...(he's VERY picky)! We are now trying the sopapillas."}
{"text":"In fairness, I only tried the house margarita, chips and salsa, and the tortilla soup.  The rather plain location along with some of the glowing yelp reviews, wants one to like it (root for the underdog), and I certainly entered the door with that attitude.  the staff was unpretentious, as was the inside decor.  the chips and salsa, standard fair; the margarita, was ok, more in size than taste, but i've certainly tasted worse.  the tortilla soup was served in a large bowl, plenty of grilled chicken to be seen, but can't honesty say that if I was ill, I'd be calling out for my loved ones to go get me a bowl to make me feel better.  would i order it again, nope.

so like so many restaurants, i wanted to really like this one, and maybe i didn't give it a fair swirl given my limited order, but i'm unlikely to give it a second chance.

sorry fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"I was with family when I came.
First of all really good service the waiter and other staff were always checking up on us. Second the food was amazing and very low price too . The only thing you you have to worry is about is if you need a box for your food because it's too good to waste ."}
{"text":"We were looking for a hole in the wall Mexican place. We found a yummy, but slightly expensive restaurant that was way better than Juan's. the Margarita was really good with no commercial sweet and sour. The beans were exquisite.  I had Camerones Poblano which were a tiny bit bland but really good. The Mexican hamburger was almost as good as The Farmers Inn Lasalle, CO. We will come back."}
{"text":"I gave it 1 start because I couldn't rate it less then that! I went there today and order 1 chicken burrito and 2 tostadas. The burrito was very small, like a taco and very bland! The tostadas was swimming in clear liquid, and the tostadas was soggy and yucky looking. I asked the waiter could I have 2 fresh tostadas without all the liquid in the plate, he then brought me out 2 plane tostadas (just the hard shell) that wasn't even warm. I explained to him I wanted a whole new plate and he wasn't willing to make me one so I didn't eat any of it. I just left out! I was HIGHLY disappointed and upset because I passed a few of my favorite Mexican restaurants to give them a try and the food and service was HORRIBLE!!! My phone was dead so I could not take any pictures which I really regret!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great place!  Food was delicious with an almost a bit of smokey flavor. Generous platter of food. Enjoying Fried Ice Cream for desert."}
{"text":"Found this little Mexican place on accident. It's really close to our house so we decided to give it a try. We ordered the one thing we order no matter where we go, chile rellenos. They have 2 options here, regular or crsipy. We ordered the traditional ones. No bueno. They were tiny, dense and the wrong cheese is used. The beans were AMAZING. Addicting I would say. The rice was pretty good. The shredded chicken sope was delicious. The chips and salsa were ok. Service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. We will be coming back to try a few other dishes but we will make sure to stay away from the chile rellenos."}
{"text":"Good restaurant with a wide selection of food.  They have much more available then most Mexican restaurants offer.  The atmosphere was nice,  very easy going and great for kids."}
{"text":"Our family has been coming here for about a year now. Very consistent quality food. I've had so many different things there it is hard to pick one out. Oh, the Tostadas (A+) The food is not too spicy. You can add some hot salsa if needed.

I concur with other reviews the staff is top notch and attentive. 

Our family, including a seven year old, likes coming here.

It is really economical also."}
{"text":"Nice big clean family Mexican restaurant with good food and drinks. The staff was also great!"}
{"text":"Service not so good. Food was ok and the house made ice tea tasted horrible.  If you going to charge  $2.75 dollars for ice tea, don't use tap water!! Not recommended"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend for a great place to have authentic Mexican food. Seems to be family owned. Staff are wonderful. I'm going to take a nap now."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Nice to have a GREAT neighborhood Mexican restaurant. Margaritas were very great as was the food!"}
{"text":"Excellent service ! Great food. I've been looking for a New Mexican restaurant in the valley. This is it !"}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place. Super friendly staff, and the food is pretty good. If you've ever been to macayos, I would say it's a bit better than that place. 

I had the 2 item combination with a chicken enchilada and a beef tamale. The chicken was pretty moist. The tamale was a little dry, but not bad. They also bring out chips and a salsa and some sort of Spanish style coleslaw. The slaw was pretty yummy, but a little difficult to eat with chips. It would be way better if the cabbage was chopped finely. The salsa was good, but not enough heat for what I like.

Overall, I'll definitely be back when I'm in the mood for some decent Mexican food, and don't feel like going far from home."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you \"root\" for and hope they stay in business.

This is a family owned and run place. Dad is your host, Mom usually takes your order, and their daughters try and anticipate your needs for refreshment and other services that make dinning enjoyable.

The food is almost \"authenitic Mexican\". It's a little bit Gringo, and I attribute that to the area. They don't want to scare off the Gringos in the area, and orient themselves to Mexican Beers and a Margarita, that they try and talk you into ordering. After all, there lies the profit in this business. 

I did find the food good, and I have visited it some six times. I finally had to give them up. Not because of the food or the service. It is certainly better than Pancho's, Macyos, or any of the other Gringo oriented chains, but it is very pricey. 

I find for the price of a decent house special burrito, I can go to other places and get a higher quality meal. If you can stick to the Daily Lunch specials priced around $8, and fill up on the chips, this is a good find. 

I wish the family well and hope they succeed. I just wish they would bring their prices more in line with other Gringo Oriented Mexican places, so I could afford to take others there, not simply eat alone, and look like a loser who just got dumped by his girlfriend."}
{"text":"The food was awesome  ,services in the restaurant sucks.Its took them a long time to take our order.Wanted desert, did not want to wait forever .Told the waiter to just bring us the bill."}
{"text":"Went on a groupon.  The restaurant is located on the corner of a strip mall, behind a convenience store.  Arrived for dinner about 7pm and were seated promptly. 

Ordered the house margarita which I was pleasently surprised has hand juice lime/lemon, because I saw and heard the bartender, who was also a server that night.  it was tasty and huge!

They serve chips and a \"pace\" salsa, which was still tasty and pickled cabbage which we weren't really fans.

Kids shared the 3 taco plate with rice and beans, and the hubby and I shared the Molcajete.  Both were delicious. 

The mocajete is a big bowl of carne asada strips, grilled chicken strips, a thin pork chop, 2 fried pieces of tilapia fish and a few pieces of grilled shrimp plus at the very bottom of the bowl was some very tasty chorizo and white cheese with green chile strips.  Each of us got a plate of rice and beans and a side of tortillas.  The meat was tender and very flavorful, you could tell they marinated it and grilled the meats.

We were so full and so satisfied, definetely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 
Service 4/5
Overall Restaurant 3/5
The food we ordered was great. Super burrito with carne asada 5/5. The chicken taquitos were really good too, 4/5. They put a red enchilada sauce on both dishes that was to die for! We both asked for extra sauce because we loved it so much. The service was good but the host and waitress did really should interest. I was the waitress go to the table in front of us and the gentleman sitting down complained because his plate was extremely hot and he was very polite about it, even said a joke or 2 and tried to engage in conversation but the waitress just seemed disinterested. (their plates come out extremely hot like they were cooking on a volcano!) The overall restaurant we have to give a 3/5 because inside the restaurant was so hot! Granted I know it's summer time in Vegas but the inside of the establishment shouldn't be. I had to stop eating my yummy food to fan myself, yes it was very warm un there. 
But overall 4/5, the food was delicious, the service wasn't bad but staff could be a bit more lively, and please set the AC temp down a little more."}
{"text":"This gringa loves being greeted in Spanish right off the bat.  Makes me feel as if I'm back in Mexico, my one-time home away from home.

An hour before closing we were almost the only customers there, and five minutes later, we were just that.  Our waiter, Pablo, was friendly and attentive, but a little bit absent-minded.  

My margarita was filled almost to overflowing, and that one drink was enough to keep me worried on the drive home.  Granted, I have a very limited capacity for alcohol, but this one was a heavy hitter.  Maybe it's just me, vertically-challenged as I am.  

We both ordered chicken:  Pollo Asado for me and Carnitas de Pollo for Herb.  We also ordered a dinner salad to share, but that never arrived.  I was afraid that the very thin slices of chicken in my dish would render them tough and dry, but they were moist and obviously well-marinated.  Very tasty.  I didn't try Herb's Carnitas, but he said they were good.  But the guacamole that was supposed to be added to both dishes was one lonely teaspoonful on mine, and completely absent on his.  The waiter obligingly brought us a small dish of the stuff, and it was quite unlike any other guacamole we've ever had:  some light-colored binder was holding the avocado together.  It wasn't mayo.  It wasn't sour cream.  It was unidentifiable (and I didn't ask).  It did nothing to enhance the very bland avocado creation I normally adore.

Normally I leave a Mexican joint with enough food to have a second meal.  Not in this case.  I cried uncle at the very last small piece of chicken.  It wasn't enough for a carry-out box, but luckily the Herb I'm married to often has the surname Hoover, so he sucked it up.

Was it good?  Yes.  Was it great? No.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and authentic. Staff was all really really nice. New fav Mexican food spot."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and finally had the chance to try it out. You know from walking in the door this place is authentic by their greeting in Spanish.

My boo and I were quickly seated at a booth and told our waiter would be right with us. Soon enough our waiter came to take our drink order and ask if we had any questions. He also brought out some heaven in a bowl aka salsa which was to die for. He was very friendly and welcoming during the whole meal and even helped us with our questions we had on using a groupon.

We initially didn't order any drinks but after seeing how everyone else raved about the margaritas I had to try one. I was certainly not disappointed. I had he mango marg which was super fresh and delicious. My boo had the 1800 which he said was great too.

For food we shared the fajitas for two. I thought it was very good but felt there could have been more meat than peppers. I did enjoy that we each got our own tortillas, rice and beans though.

Overall I thought this place was great but the only reason for a four star was the prices. I felt it was quite expensive compared to other Mexican restaurants near by. I'm sure I'll still be back soon anyways and can't wait to try something new!"}
{"text":"Finally a awesome Mexican restaurant! I'm from Okc and we have some great spots there but I have yet to find a quality place out here until accidentally finding this place! So so good! Authentic is the key here! I live in Henderson and will come here for my fix from now on. Highly recommend! (:"}
{"text":"1 Word:  Amazing!  Food was so good! I had the Chicken Enchilada & chicken taco lunch combination & I couldve licked the plate lol not really but sooooo good!"}
{"text":"This is one of those great family operated spots with great original mexican food. Authentic but has home made recipes with just enough unique style to be relevant. No frills, just a great spot to eat mexican without hating life the next day."}
{"text":"Family owned. Very good food and full bar. Very friendly and attentive. Try it and support small local business."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, authentic, and very filling. Staff was great! Prices are reflective of a good, sit-down, large portioned meal. No complaints here whatsoever!
LV, SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES! :)"}
{"text":"This place deserves SIX stars both for the food and the service! I went here because I had a coupon from my entertainment book, otherwise I would have never known it was there since it is in a mini mall kind of back far from the street. It's on Durango which is very close to my house but I don't travel Durango often so I've missed it. There were three of us. My dad had a huge margarita to start off with. Their salsa is delicious - the very best in Vegas. They also serve a tasty marinated cabbage appetizer which was great. Our server, Pablo, was the nicest guy! He made sure we had everything we needed and was very friendly. I had the super enchiladas which was on special for $9.99. I got chicken enchiladas which were marinated perfectly and so tender. This dish comes with rice and beans and guacamole and sour cream! That's something you don't normally see on an enchilada! My dad got the super enchiladas as well and he ordered the pork. His were very flavorful with a wonderful green sauce on them. My husband ordered a combination which was a chimichanga with shredded beef and and enchilada with shredded beef. He said it was very great with just the right amount of spice. We cannot wait to go back and are bringing my daughter to eat there this weekend!"}
{"text":"Very bad service. Ordered fajita for 2 and meat tasted spoiled. Cups ran empty. Small portions. Will not be returning. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Well being Mexican myself, this place not authentic at all.  I ordered tacos al carbon with rice and beans on the side,my rice and beans were cold and my tacos were soggy because they pour some kind of sauce over them that's not good at all.  I didn't finish my food and their prices are high.  My fianc√© had a beef burrito and it came back as a wet burrito that also look disgusting and he didn't finish it either. Their customer service is like they're trying just to hard.  It was annoying. Also while we were there another family came in and sat but they ended up walking out which we should of done too."}
{"text":"To be greeted in Spanish was a wonderful feeling and such an awesome touch as to be the cherry on top. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was actually very comfortable and welcoming. Very very clean also!! I wish I could give more feedback on the food. I had a cheese enchilada and beef taco lunch combo. The food was ok. I'm sure there are many delicious dishes to enjoy. I wouldn't mind returning to enjoy a margarita and an actual dinner and possibly try out one of their desserts. I'm sure they wouldn't disappoint."}
{"text":"We love the restaurant, the atmosphere, the food and the people. The owner and the entire staff are the most sweetest people and so kind and remember us each time we visit. My husband loves the fact that they offer whole beans too as so many mexican restaurants only offer refried. The food has always been delicious, the margaritas are awesome and whenever we have a family celebration or guests, we take them to El Mescal. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome staff n amazing food! El mescal enchiladas n tacos al pastor will keep us coming back!"}
{"text":"We were craving fajitas and wanted to try something new and authentic and based on reviews we visited this place.

I have to say the service was great..everything else was really really bad I don't understand where these reviews are coming from..
**Menus were greasy 

Appetizer: Carne asada cassadilla, generous portion of meet (beef tips) with barely any cheese, flavorless & very dry..

Fajita for 2, steak and chicken (very small portion)
Steak was (very low quality) overly  marinated with odd flavors and vinegar, couldn't eat it.
Chicken was dry and overcooked. 
A lot of bell peppers and some burnt onions. 
Came with rice (dry and flavorless) ,beans (ok), sour cream, guacamole and lettuce.

Dessert: we ordered their signature dessert..it had no flavor...no sugar..only the ice cream was edible
very disappointing, worst mexican food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Several friends had eaten here and said it was pretty good. I ate dinner here this week. It's very clean, which I liked very much. They serve chips and salsa and those were good. They gave my son free rice and refried beans, which were pretty good. I thought this was a very nice of them. I ordered the pollo fundido which was chicken breast covered in melted cheese.  I did not care for it. The cheese was waxy and tasted like white American cheese, the square Kraft kind I haven't eaten since I was a kid. My husband got the carne Asada quesadilla and he didn't like the flavor of the meat, but it was pretty big and had a lot of meat in it. I thought it was a little pricey, but I probably feel that way because I didn't enjoy my food. My plate was $15.50 and my husband's was about the same. The staff was really nice and friendly though and they checked on us often.  I don't have any plans to return at this time."}
{"text":"Food is decent but overpriced for what it is. Unfortunately it's hard to look past a roach walking across the dining floor..."}
{"text":"Awesome new restaurant! Yummy margaritas made by a very friendly Pablo and fresh, delicious, real Mexican food!  My new favorite place in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Cheese dip and guacamole were dangerously addictive. Reasonably priced, friendly service and nice, clean dining room. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, and drinks! I had the tacos rancheros and the meat was really good. The dish could've used a bit more salt but other then that it was delicious. I also had the perfect margarita which was perfectly crafted. Choose your margarita size carefully, I had the medium and I had a good buzz halfway through. The salsas are also good. Can't wait to try different dishes and margaritas next time!"}
{"text":"Exelente servicio. El lugar muy bonito y muy rica la comida. La locacion esta un poco escondida pero vale la pena burcarlo. 100% recomendado."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!  Pablo and Stefanie are delightful.  We both enjoyed shrimp entrees and our food was delicious.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First, the \"medium\" margaritas are HUGE! And delicious!! Next, they have lunch specials  from 10 to 3 everyday; $6.99 for a wide variety of plates. Then there's happy hour from 2 to 5 where you can get their \"medium\" margaritas for $7.99; you'd be doing good if you can put back two. Last, the food. It was amazing!! I got crispy chile rellenos and they made me moan with pleasure; I like that in a food. Will return to El Mezcal."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Fast friendly service.  The cheese enchiladas were delicious."}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times and each time I've been looking for something negative to say about this place, I can't! The food is outstanding. The Margheritas are great, the staff is attentive and friendly. I love this place. The menu is typical of a Mexican place and the prices are reasonable, you definitely get what you pay for. No gimmicks just really good family friendly food. It is refreshing to see a family owned and operated restaurant in a world of chains"}
{"text":"Food was descent but not to die for. I've had better. The waiter was nice and did a good job. The prices are way too expensive for this quality of Mexican food. Everything is $16+. I've  been to cheaper Mexican restaurants and the food was better"}
{"text":"I really liked this place and I was disappointed there was only one other couple eating when we went.  90% of Mexican food in Vegas is inexplicably bad, but this place hit all of what makes a place good for me: 

Queso (could use some hot peppers but still good)
Choice of whole beans rather than refried
Non boring non meat options
Free chips

I had the Burrito El Gordo, which is a burrito full of a crispy chile relleno. The waiter recommended I change the sauce to the chipotle sauce which was actually spicy and really good. I am looking forward to going back and trying other things. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the salsa, but otherwise one of my favorite Mexican in Vegas.

Also, the comparisons to Roberto's are super weird because Roberto's is so bad and not even similar."}
{"text":"I came here to meet up with a friend who wanted to celebrate with some margaritas. Or margarita, to be exact. 

And because I was semi-hungry, I ordered a shredded meat quesadilla. This stuff was actually really good, and the only thing that I can complain about was that it had TOO much shredded meat inside? It was more like Meat and no cheese quesadilla. But, I shouldn't complain, right? 

The salsa was legit. Really good flavors. Strawberry margarita was too sweet, but the mango margarita was VERY good. 

The place had NO ONE except us two girls, but it could have been because it was 1.5 hours before closing time. I also didn't think it was a great sight to see a kid and mom (perhaps related to the owners or workers) running around in the entrance area and playing on the floor. Let's keep it classy, people!"}
{"text":"Good food yes a little bit overpriced the online menu looks so good they really  invest money on that one
 but just a just a regular eatery no music my food was very good steak and shrimp with melted cheese on top I never saw this cheese but the sauce was awesome good portion even the steak  was paper thin  and small shirmp other dishes are serve with prawns well maybe maybe those are Mexicans lol
 just a large shrimp a great team work everybody was checking on everybody good thing even they got really busy with that big party 
We may comeback."}
{"text":"Just like grandma makes it 5stars, will come back for drinks and awesome guacamole:)))))"}
