{"text":"I randomly went here when my friend and I were hanging out at the Boardwalk. I got the Kung Pao chicken and it was pretty terrible. I had to force myself to finish it. The rice was cooked well at least and the sauce wasn't too bad. 

The waiter that got my order ready for takeout was completely hitting on me, but he was really nice and quick with my order. 

Good service but bad food. After that terrible Kung Pao tofu, I never came back."}
{"text":"House of Leng's food has consistent and good quality. The ingredients are always fresh and the menu has the standard traditional american \"chinesish\" food offerings. The decor and atmosphere is modern and clean and it is a good size restaurant for their business volume and it is in very convenient location to a lot of offices and homes. Now for some of my wife and my favorite dishes. The pork lo mein is good but has some faults. There are no bean sprouts and it has a little too much brown sauce, but the pork was the southern style sweet \"choshu\" - delicious. The sesame tofu is excellent. This dish is fried tofu cubes with a sesame brown sauce over it. We order it with the sauce on the side because the tofu comes straight out the deep fryer beautifully crispy. If you do not order it with the sauce on the side they drown it in sauce destroying the crispiness and the sauce is overpowering. Another winner is the \"house special\" soup appetizer for two which has whipped egg whites floating in it. I have has the chow fun in the past and it was very good. Also their crispy scallop dish is very good as well. Most of their dishes have the same brown sauce as a key ingredient, which wont annoy most patrons because most wont be ordering 10 plates of food to entertain a large party with variety. Again, the strength here is that the quality is consistent and the ingredients fresh and the taste is good to excellent on average."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for dinner.  Service and prices was good.  Had the moo shu pork.  it was good.  husband had the scallops w/ garlic sauce.  good, but could have a bit lighter on the brown sauce.  Very generous on portions. gave us 2 generous bowls of rice.  which all chinese restaurants  never do.  Springs roll was good.  

Yes, we will be back again !"}
{"text":"Good food, with big portions. Went on a Sunday afternoon, ordered a spring roll, lettuce wraps, scrimp fried rice, and a noodle dish. Their plum sauce is a good compliment to the meal. Ate off of this food for 3 days. I will be back!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to go when I want Chinese for lunch. I work at the nursing home right across from the boardwalk so I just call in and pick up. Not to heavy on the stomach , but fills you up. Sesame tofu is what I always get. Very good and for a decent price too. You can't go wrong with the is place ."}
{"text":"Tasty food. I recommend avoiding this place on the weekends. It's crazy and the staff do not know how to work efficiently. They brought our food to the wrong table. The flavor was lacking. Go here during the week when it's not busy."}
{"text":"Average beef and broccoli dish. I didn't like the extra charge for fried rice with meal, any choice of rices are included at other Chinese  restaurants."}
{"text":"When we visit Atlanta, we really love to visit Chou Lee for Chinese/Asian food.  Chou Lee makes their own duck sauce and offers several vegetarian options.  Now that our visits to Atlanta have decreased, I really long for Chou Lee's Mongolian Tofu.

Well, I think I have a local fave to satiate my cravings...House of Leng - University.  Although the dish does not come with the broccoli, scallions and onions served at Chou Lee's, it's pretty close ($2 charged for the  extra veggies).  The servers are consistently attentive and pleasant - never had a bad experience.  Add to the fact the portions are large enough for leftovers later, this restaurant is worth the trip.  Visit H.O.L. when you want a fast casual dinner and maybe with a cocktail to boot.  If you have last minute guests, their takeout is way better than your local pizza delivery - and I cannot count the times H.O.L. has come through on a weekday night.

Enjoy the food, service and drinks - and you surely won't be hungry two hours later  (serious myth lol)."}
{"text":"The food here is like bad Chinese takeout except you get it on a plate instead of in a white box.  Super greasy and stale tasting.    The restaurant was busy and people were being shuffled in and out like cattle.  Waiter was more interested in getting our order fast and getting us out.

Large portions though if you are into greasy Chinese food.

There is a better Chinese buffet across Harris Blvd.  Same greasy Chinese type food but fresh and buffet style."}
{"text":"Very good food. Wait staff sometimes takes a minute to show up when you want to get check or refill but other than than it was good. Would come again"}
{"text":"It's a standard Chinese menu restaurant. But... OMG - five minute to go order and your order is ready! Totally recommend if you about to pass out of hunger. 

But if you are not so hungry, they have good food too."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed eating here.  My family and I were visiting the weekend and found this place on Yelp.  Delicious.  They will change dishes at request where we had the mangolian pork instead of the beef and it was bt far the best dish.  The apps were good, especially the tofu lettuce wraps.  The shrimp and vegs had jumbo sheimps and they were cooked to perfection.  Our server and staff were attentive , speedy service.  The restaurant was clean and located in a nice outlet with lake in the back, just wish it had a lake view.   Great will come again if ever in town."}
{"text":"There is not really anything special in there. The service is really really nice though. But the food is neither standard American Chinese food nor real Chinese food.

I do like their cheese cake."}
{"text":"The crispy tofu and crispy noodles are yummy and portion sizes are huge- enough for lunch the next day. I love the avocado boba tea as well- they use an entire fresh avocado to make it- yum!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in area. Every dish I've eaten has been wonderful. Entr√©es are big enough for two people or another meal for home. Prices good."}
{"text":"Parking is not good here especially if there is concert . The food on mallard creek taste better. i love you guys and i eat there every week.  Any one say  anything bad about you guys are just plain crazy in the membrane"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of House of Leng. They have a nice variety of dishes though sometimes it can be slightly greasy. The veggies are crisp and flavorful. Leng is my go-to spot for chinese food when I'm in the area. They have all of the traditional dishes and some you won't find at other restaurants. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"After checking into the Hilton, we walked around the Boardwalk to check out what restaurants are in the area. Honestly, we smelled Chinese since we went outside and was searching for it. We finally found House of Leng.

It's nice and cozy inside. I ordered Orange Chicken with Fried rice. When it came out, it was more brown than orange. It still was yummy. The food portion was huge and I was unable to finish it. My niece ate the rest of my chicken. The staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food at a very good price. Staff was very professional and attentive, food was solid and atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"Love this place! It may seem a little pricy but especially if you eat in the portions are HUGE. I love going here the food is so good and they use fresh veggies so I can actually get something healthy (ish)."}
{"text":"pun leng is very unproffesssional and lacks business ethics. she wanted to purcahse advertisement then failed to respond to emailed invoices and phone calls to pay for her requested ad. i would not recommed this place to any one!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok you cant go wrong with house of leng guys, from Crispy scallion chicken to tofu in garlic sauce this place is the most consistent i have ever seen a restaurant be. I have been coming here for years lunch/dinner and they are clean, quick and great food. They have two locations they are both great!"}
{"text":"I've visited House of Leng in the University area a few times for lunch.  They offer a great, simple Chinese meal experience at great lunch prices, and everything is served quickly so I can get in and out within my lunch hour.  

Although the restaurant doesn't have much of a \"Chinese\" feel, it's modern and clean, so it's great for dining with friends,colleagues, or kids, but not so great for a romantic or intimate atmosphere.   

The only downside is that I leave stuffed and then feel like I need to go back to work and take a nap. :)"}
{"text":"Nope, I will never go back to this place. Food was just crappy. Service wasn't that bad although my server could've informed me more on items i ordered.  The shrimp with chili sauce was AWFUL. Tiny shrimp that weren't \"cleaned\" with this terrible thick red sauce and huge onion slices all over. I expected some yummy spicy chili dish---
i also ordered seafood dumplings - LAME! They were rubbery and just a piece of shrimp inside. I was thinking like a medley of seafood, ya know? 
my friend ordered general tso chicken- sauce was thick and dark, not what our ideas of this dish would be. Eggrolls? Terrible. Way too expensive for being unsatisfied, 40$ for two bites. Nope! That was my first and last time."}
{"text":"I went for dinner here and the service was horrible!! We ordered the seafood dumplings appetizer an order of Sesame chicken and General Tso's (half spicy and half not because they didn't have a kids menu for my girlfriends daughter to chose from). And not only did we not receive our appetizer at all, the General Tso's was spicy and there was no second plate that we asked for. The food was ok nothing spectacular. It tastes like they cooked the chicken over an open flame. It was kind of charred. Needless to say it was a bad first experience and I will not return."}
{"text":"Lunch is not as cheap as it is at a lot of places.  Portion size was enough food for lunch but, I'm used to having leftovers.

I had some errands to run in University and I was hungry.  I've got a \"go to\" Chinese spot about 5 miles in any direction from here but, didn't have the time today, so here is where I ended up.

Its right near the lake, along with Ciro's, Zapata's, Boardwalk Billy's.  The decor is nice but, nothing special.  They have some booths and some tables.  I was promptly seated in a pretty much empty restaurant in one of the booths.  My waiter was quick and polite.  I wasn't extremely thrilled to not see a single meal for under $6 and that they didn't come with soup.  What can I say, I'm spoiled.  I went with the beef and broccoli.  It came out within 5 minutes.  The broccoli was barely cooked but I liked it.  The little pieces of beef were in a brown sauce that was quite salty.  My egg roll was leaking a Valdez style pool of oil in this over-salted sauce.  I've seen this before, when the egg roll has a whole and it and it just soaks up the oil.  My waiter was quite attentive but, nothing was going to save this meal.

If in a hurry, you can grab a decent bite for under $10 for lunch.  But, as soon as I left I saw that Zapata's has a $6.99 lunch special including drink next door, Ciro's is good Italian food, and of course if you really want Asian there's always Thai House across the street."}
{"text":"I have had takeout from here and I've eaten in the restaurant. For whatever reason, the quality of the food seemed better when dining in and the portions seemed bigger. That doesn't make any sense to me, but that's been my experience.

While the food is very good, each time I've eaten in the restaurant they brought out our meals as they were ready, so everyone was not served at the same time. I asked about it and they said they bring it out as it is done so the food doesn't get cold. Very few dishes are finished at the same time in any restaurant, but it's normal to bring everything out at once, so I found this really odd. Overall, the service was just average, but the food is good enough for me to go back again.

So far, the dishes I've had that were very good are the twice cooked pork, garlic chicken and the Saigon noodles with chicken."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant.  The staff was very courteous and hospitable. The food was delicious. Unfortunately my 8 year old liked my food better than hers and she ate a lot of mine. Fortunately the servings were more than generous so it didn't cause too much trauma."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my daughter. They had a 96 sanitation grade. The place was clean. Food was just ok for the prices. Service could've been more attentive. I was without drink a couple of times. I actually had to call them to get a refill. Overall I give this place 3 starts because it wasn't bad. Wasn't great......wasn't bad. Just ok."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised !!! The prices were amazing and the food was delicious. Came in on a Friday night with a party of ten including children and we were seated and served quickly! The entire party enjoyed their meals. I ordered the house lo mein and it was simply delicious. Great portions too!! We all had to take a to go box home :)
The resturant appeared clean and the ladies bathroom was also clean."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this restaurant at least 5 times.  It's a little pricey, but the food quality is awesome and the portions are decent.  I don't like using Grub Hub since they always seem to deliver leaky bags, etc."}
{"text":"House Of Leng has become the go-to place for chinese food for me and my husband. Their Crispy Scallion Chicken dish is our absolute favorite but everything we've ever tried on the menu has been delicious. The veggie Lo Mein and pork Lo Mein in particular are great. As for appetizers,  their dumplings,  spring rolls and calamari have all been good. We don't always necessarily order appetizers so I haven't tried that many items off the appetizer menu..but what we have had has never disappointed us. 

Service is good and attentive - they don't hover around you too much so that you get your privacy (which is something I always appreciate when dining out and trying to have a conversation) but they make sure they are always close enough to serve you when you need them. Food comes out quite quick and it's always super fresh. Prices are very reasonable considering the size of the dishes - we always leave with a box of leftovers because the dishes are so big, which makes for yummy next day snacking:)

We've tried two different locations - the University City one and the one at Mallard Creek - and I must say that though both have been good, the Lengs in University City is better. Definitely a go-to place for spicy(ish) chinese style chicken!"}
{"text":"Granted, we went on a Saturday night with a big group....but the service was atrocious. Entrees took about an hour and came out at different times. Apparently Peking duck takes an additional 30 min, but we were not forewarned. Food was good, but not worth that wait."}
{"text":"After trying the Mallard Creek location we decided to give the University location of House of Leng a try this weekend. The dining room is spacious, which meant that even on a Friday evening there were plenty of empty tables and we were seated immediately. All of the staff was very friendly and attentive, quick to refill drinks and frequently checking to make sure we didn't need anything. The food was quick to arrive, hot, and the flavor, while not super exciting, was nice enough. I do wish both entrees were less greasy. And none of the flavors really stood out as dominant in the Szechuan Twin Twist that I ordered, but I did appreciate that they had a number of dishes that included both chicken and shrimp.

All in all House of Leng was a positive experience when we were looking for a quick, casual, easy dinner out. Not the best Chinese I've had in CLT but certainly not the worst."}
{"text":"I ordered just a side of steamed vegetables with general tso sauce & it was over $5.  However it was good, & they did give me a huge tub of the sauce.  Compared to most places the sauce was not as thick/gooey, & it didn't taste spicy at all, which I liked, but just depends on your preference."}
{"text":"Service was quick, food was excellent
We ordered 
Beef and broccoli 
Sacha shrimp
House special fried rice 
House special Lo mein"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Crispy scallion was as good as I've ever had,  wonton soup was superb (needs more wonton dumplings though) and egg rolls were delicious. I love Chinese food but find it difficult to get good fare in North Carolina.

House of Leng does not disappoint! 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Came here thinking it may be pretty good....ordered the General Taos chicken had to send it back because it was fried so hard...yuck it was crunchy and hard as hell felt like I was chewing on small rocks...I swapped it for sesame chicken...well it came out almost as hard fried as the General... but it was tolerable... now the spring roll was delicious... overall I would not come back to this joint."}
{"text":"We have been to the restaurant about 4 times in the last four weeks.

The food is good but not always consistent. We ordered the orange chicken a couple of weeks ago. It was so hard we could barely chew it. Needless to say, we did not eat it all.

My issues are:

1. The owner is always trying to nickel and dime us- if we ask for sauce it's an additional cost. The waitress tonight said it was a dollar extra. Ok, no problem. The bill came it was two. We asked about it, and she said I'll take it off. We heard her ask the owner if the sauce was $1 or $2. She came back, placed the bill on the table, and walked away. We checked the bill, and the $2 was still there. We asked her about it, her response was... \"oh, I just said I was going to ask about it.\" Okbecause we didn't hear you clearly say that you would take it off! 

2. If you order the fried rice and eat in the restaurant the serving is much bigger than if you order it to go! We absolutely tested this out.

There are few other minor issues but, I digress.

We were already teetering on whether or not to patronize this business again. Tonight confirmed that we will not return."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. Caleb Register was a very attentive and helpful server. Will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"OK folks this is the best sit down Chinese restaurant in town. They have the best house special fried rice, the best sauces on their food you can find, great service, friendly staff and owners. I really can't say enough good things about this place. I've been coming  for years and have never been  disappointed. And if you like pork dumplings order them deep fried they are delicious and they are better that way then pan-fried or steamed"}
{"text":"Had supper at House of Link tonight. Food was okay but the service was very poor and slow. Had to even ask for silverware. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very nice staff! Food wasn't amazing though. It wasn't bad food at all, it just wasn't great. I'd rather have eaten at a shopping center Chinese place. Also we made reservations a month out & they were unsure of the day once it arrived. Great location, not too crowded."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and ordered the chicken fried rice. It was absolutely DISGUSTING!! The rice was old and hard. The chicken was dry and hard. The entire dish tasted as if it was sitting out over night from the day before! I will never, ever eat here again!!"}
{"text":"I would have eaten there but I was told there was no public restroom. I wanted to wash my hands first. It seemed like a nice place. ...too nice not to have a bathroom. Odd."}
{"text":"It was one of my worst experiences. Don't get me wrong- i love Chinese food but i would rather go for those Chinese take outs instead.  We had two dishes and they both lacked flavor and were just swimming in a pool of soy sauce. It was extremely salty and just had no flavor other than the soy sauce. I would rather save some bucks and go to a Chinese take out - hence the two stars!"}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese resturant. I keep looking for the same floral green chairs, fake water paintings, and buffet line but, none of those can be found anywhere.  I went close to closing and the staff was still warm and inviting and assured me that I wasn't putting them out and that I should order. I've driven by a couple times and it always looks busy and I under stand why. Although prices are a little more expensive than standard Chinese, the entree size more than makes up for it. I got pepper steak and could barely finish it which says a lot. The egg rolls were crisp and the take out traveled well. If you are looking for elevated Chinese this place is the perfect spot without uptown pretension."}
{"text":"I had to come a second time before writing a review. The first time was too good to be true. I had The Sesame Chicken w/ Fried Rice and Two Eggrolls! EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! On this second visit I tried the Seafood Lomein and it tasted SO MUCH different than what I am used to, however it was the absolute BEST Lomein that I've ever eaten! The Seafood was cooked to perfection and the portion was hefty! This is my new Chinese Restaurant! There's no reason to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious. My wife and I are new in town and this is easily better than the best Chinese where we're from. The General's Chicken had a nice crispy texture and the broccoli was full of flavor. The crab rangoons were perfect. Service was on point and overall a great experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I remember thinking this was the best chinese food in town by far. The last two times were terrible. Maybe they've since fell off. Last visit I Had house special singapore rice noodles and the time before that had the seafoood noodle soup. Both were bad. My sister had orange chicken last time and we hated it. It didn't seem like actual meat at all. it was the worst. My nephew likes the sesame chicken but he likes everything. the sauce for it is good so i usually have some of that over some white rice. Would give 1 star but i do remember them being really good. I dont know what happened."}
{"text":"I had high hopes that this would be a killer meal mainly based upon photos and reviews House of Leng has but I may have set my expectations too high. I didn't have the pleasure of dining in, so take-out may have kicked the quality factory. The food was presented tastefully but fell flat in the actual flavor tasting oddly bland for the amount of ingredients in the food. This may have just been a one-off experience, I just don't particularly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food is great! I've eaten here three times and I haven't been disappointed yet! And beware, if you order a large bowl of soup, they go above and beyond and serve you an extra large!:) great portions for your money! The service is great too!"}
{"text":"I've been going to House of Leng since it first opened! I come here about once a week! It is always good, its my go to Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!

Recommended Dishes= Sesame Chicken, Sesame Tofu, Scallion Chicken, General Tso. w/white rice & spring roll.

This House of Leng is very consistent & friendly!"}
{"text":"I love the Asparagus Beef and Mongolian Beef. When I'm feeling it's appropriate to discipline my diet choices, I stop to be served my Chinese over a buffet I like on University City Blvd. 
I'm annoyed that HoL charges $2 for brown rice when no other Chinese (including Baoding and Dragonfly in SouthPark) do."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I visit House of Leng in the University area on a regular occasions for lunch. They offer tasty, simple Chinese dishes at  low prices (for lunch anyways). The service is always very good and the food takes only a few minutes to come out. 

The atmosphere is lacking that oriental feel but I have no complaints regarding its modern styling ques; Very open and inviting. 

Overall, its a great place that I enjoy time and time again!"}
{"text":"The food was great the service smh not so great maybe they were having a bad day but I would eat there again"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on recommendation from a coworker and have been four times in under a month's time. For some reason, I'd never paid much attention to this place whenever I was in the area running errands but now I cannot stop raving about it to others. My personal favorites are the General Tso's chicken, veggie fried rice and the egg rolls.  Delicious, affordable chinese food!"}
{"text":"I've met my boyfriend at the House of Leng for lunch once or twice, since it's within walking distance of his office. It's pretty standard Chinese fare. At least at lunch, the prices are reasonable, and you get a lot of food for your money.

The last time we went, I ordered the General (Tso's) Chicken. It was fairly tasty for the most part, but it got really salty at the bottom of the dish, so I didn't quite finish it. This is unusual for me; read what you want in to it."}
{"text":"I live in South End Charlotte currently and have been searching for a Chinese takeout restaurant since I moved to the area July 2016. I have tried many places but after being over charged for the quantity ordered, having an upset stomach from food poisoning, and general concerns of cleanliness of establishment I had all but given up on Chinese take out in my area. 

While House of Leng is in the university city area (about 20 minutes away) I frequent the area visiting friends and other stores, which is how I found this establishment. I have been twice in the span of a week and ordered chicken fried rice both times - the second time because I enjoyed it so much the first time. They give you large portions for a very reasonable price and they are large enough to share with family and even save for lunch the next day. I can't wait to go back to try a couple more items from their menu! They have my business!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and we ended up at House of Leng for lunch on our final day.

The parking situation isn't great. As part of the larger shopping center, you can easily end up with a decent hike to get to the restaurant.

They were able to easily accomodate our medium sized group with minimal notice. The service was reasonably quick but the food did take some time and didn't come out together. There was at least a five minute gap between the first plates coming out and my food coming out.

The food was pretty good, we had a fair mix in the group, I got the eggplant chicken and enjoyed it. The eggplant especially was well cooked. The portions were generous and each entree was about $7-$8.

The food is good but nothing special but for the price, the quality and quantity are tough to beat."}
{"text":"We ended up trying this spot out because I was having a random craving for Singapore Noodles, and it being Sunday, options were limited!  I went to Yelp, searched Singapore Noodles and this was the closest option!  I also had a coupon.... so it was a no-brainer!

This place is in the boardwalk in University.  We have been to the Mallard location once, which is a little nicer, but this location was much bigger.  The first floor has large booths and tables, the second floor is all tables.

Service is pretty attentive and they seem to be on a teamwork serving rotation so most servers can help you with what you may need.  We liked both our appetizer (steamed dumplings) as well as our meals (we both got the Singapore noodles with chicken).  Huge bang for your buck- 8.50 for a TON of food.  One star taken away for the chaos of the restaurant... it was a little loud.We will be back!"}
{"text":"We used to come here more often but not so much recently as it feels like the quality of the food has declined over time. 

That being said, the moo shoo pork is still one of the best (if not the best) on this side of town."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for fresh authentic Asian cuisine. My favorite dish is the orange shrimp which is fried crispy and completely dipped and covered with orange sauce served with white or brown rice"}
{"text":"I had previously had success at University location and decided to try this one out. I was pleased with the demeanor over the phone. When I arrived the clerk was friendly and ensured I got what I ordered. She even made sure I got extra sauce packets."}
{"text":"House of Leng is a great place to eat lunch with decent prices and fantastic food. The Chicken with Cashew s is great. They have some of the best sweet tea in Charlotte. The Staff is friendly and very attentive to their patrons.

I eat here very often and i plan on returning very frequently.

Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This place is great. Never too crowded, nice atmosphere. Dinner will cost about $10 a person but it's well worth it. The food is great and they give HUGE portions, I can never eat more than half! I highly recommend this for anyone who loves great Chinese food."}
{"text":"House of Leng is a great spot if you're looking for more than take-out Chinese food. The quality here is excellent with classic dishes and homemade sauce. The sauce sets House of Leng apart.

The inside is pretty spacious and always clean. The service here has never been anything but friendly. The recipes here come from a family who has been doing it for 20+ years. I was introduced to House of Leng a few years ago by family friends and they refuse to go anywhere else for Chinese.

This is a pretty convenient location near the UNCC area and located at the boardwalk in university area. Be prepared to shell out more than your typical take out prices, but it's very reasonable. The portion sizes for dinner are too much for one person, so prepare to have  leftovers. 

5 stars for quality food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and this is one of my favorite Chinese places. I love the location and the food is great. I normally get House fried rice or House Special Lo-Mein. I love their eggrolls. I have never had any complaints and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is consistently good, and everything that I've tried from here has been delicious. I could eat it everyday.

I'd recommend the choice of two (I get shrimp and chicken, add spice), and the shrimp fried rice is really good, too. The portions are a good size, and I've never had a problem with requesting slight changes to my meal if I wanted (more sauce, add spice, no onions, etc).

The restaurant is clean, and it's nice for a date or outing because it's right in the boardwalk area. The customer service isn't anything to write home about, but it's not bad either."}
{"text":"Well everything that shines isn't gold. I decided to try this location of house of leng out. Going to the location on mallard creek has never been a problem, but here we go At 1st glance I though the place was packed it wasn't we were quickly seated and our order was taken we start noticing people coming in and then leaving couldn't figure out why but maybe it was because they said they were out of chicken wings! But that continued for 45mins then we noticed snow peas all over one table as if they were being cleaned or something. Then we noticed people coming for there pk up orders and waiting just as long as we were sitting. And lastly my food came and I was amazed at how it looked at smelled until I dug in. I ordered house special chow fun w/chicken shrimp and beef snow peas, bean sprouts. What I thought was an abundance of chicken was wonton noodles tossed in.  So ridiculous we just paid our bill and left SAD!"}
{"text":"Their Crispy scallion chicken was impressive. Good food with value for money. Wish they had this Option of white or fried rice with entree like other places without having to pay extra to upgrade to fried rice. But this restaurant is definitely in the list of go to places !!"}
{"text":"Wow. Avoid this place. My wife and I went here after work. One of the severs say us in the main dining while another was prepping prepping peas at one of the other tables - clue number one. A server finally came over after seven or eight minutes to take our drink order. We placed our appetizer order that took over twenty minutes to get there. We ordered bbq ribs that were almost impossible to eat. Super dry and very tough not to mention no sauce on them  at all. Our meals came out around ten minutes later with no rice (showed up much later). I ran out of iced tea and try to get the attention of our server who had returned to picking peas and texting on her phone. I mean really, what a joke. We will certainly never be going back here again."}
{"text":"Been in the Queen City  for 5 months and finally found a great Chinese food option!!! Huge portions - modestly priced- fast service - clean place and most important good food!   

You can't go wrong with Hunan Shrimp  or Kung Bo Chicken  or Mongolian Beef !!!!  I've had each one now and each was a winner! 

Rich sauces - full of flavor- served fresh - and the spring rolls are good too!!!! 

Definitely will be in my regular rotation!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food Ive ever had. My mom refuses to eat Chinese, says it all tastes the same and for the most part I agree with her but their food is good quality and you can taste the flavors. Well worth the drive to pick up since they dont deliver. **Disclaimer**Dont order the crab rangoons...at close to $1 a piece, they are a HUGE rip off. Nothing but wrapper, basically no cream cheese filling and no sweet and sour sauce comes with them. Id have given 5 stars if the rangoons were good."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food! The staff is always accommodating and friendly! I love the beef and broccoli and the crispy scallion chicken! You really can't go wrong with any selection. The location is also very nice. After dinner you can shop at surrounding shops then walk around the nice pond or even ride paddle boats!"}
{"text":"I will not be returning here. They are way expensive. An order of General Chicken with a spring roll is $14! You can get double the food and better food at the at other local places. I am a huge fan of Chinese and this is one of the worst. The General Chicken had a bitter taste and was not sweet. There were more vegetables than actual meat. Every place I have been gives you two spring rolls for $1.50. Here they charge the same but for only one. The food was fast but that's about to it. I would certainly look elsewhere. There is better Chinese food at better prices."}
{"text":"The food was only OK. I would have marked them a 2 star if it weren't for the service."}
{"text":"They gave my to go food away to the wrong person. Instead of telling me their mistake, they made me wait and come back 15 times before I finally caught on. Then when I asked her why she didn't tell me about the mistake, she tried to tell me I wasn't getting my food. THEN the cash register didn't work for anyone during the whole time I waited for my sub par food. This place is a joke. They think their shitty Subpar Asian ways will fly in America. DONT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Not as good as the other HOL.  The reason i say this is that my companion ordered less sauce and got something so saucy she couldn't finish it.  They have the same menu and the staff all seem very nice.  I think I will return and give them another chance."}
{"text":"For american style Chinese food, I think they overall do a good job with the dishes.  The issues I've had are more with servers and any requests.  If you ask for a spicy dish to be mild, it's about a 50/50 if that happens correctly.  They seem to have a team serving concept where different servers are assisting you, the problem is you have to flag them down for everything, refills, check, boxes, etc.  The staff is always friendly, they are trying their best, just need a little management intervention."}
{"text":"We used to eat at this location a few times a month for several years when we lived less than a mile from it.

The food was always good, the waitstaff always great, and the prices were about what I expected for the restaurant's ambiance, etc.

When my daughter was little, the waiters always made a fuss over her. She loved it."}
{"text":"Dinner was good but I dials agree with automatic gratuity of a party of 5 and you run out if dessert in the morning I really was looking forward to the key lime pie!"}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of this place.  Usually get the Orange Chicken to use that as the bar, and it was horrendous.  I think they bought frozen popcorn chicken, and put a gross glaze on it.  Service was great, in it was extremely quick.  Only saving grace for them..."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location, by the water where you'll find paddle boats when the weather permits and next to several restaurants and shops. 

Came here with friends for a quick lunch during work hours and they did not disappoint. Chinese food cooks quickly anyway but I'm convinced they must have woks searing food in 3000 degree flames! Our food came out piping hot 3 minutes after we ordered - and that's during the lunch peak with a packed house! If you're on a time crunch, come through. 

The menu is larger than most places. So many options and even a few photos for those who eat with their eyes. It's not an authentic Chinese spot but with such a large menu, I was secretly hoping they'd at least have a few authentic dishes. Oh well. 

Onto the food! 
We had shrimp fried rice, beef and broccoli and chicken Singaporean noodles (mei fun)
I must say - the mei fun here is extraordinary. The curry flavor is strong without overpowering the noodles and veggies which were cooked perfectly. And the portion is huge enough to share with the table. The shrimp fried rice was ok. I didn't order It but had a taste and It was pretty standard. The beef and broccoli was a hit. The broccoli was cooked just enough to take off the raw bite but not so much that you lose the crunchy texture. There's nothing worse than soggy broccoli. Their brown sauce is unlike anything I've had before. It was so savory and had an umami type essence - MSG perhaps? I'm not opposed to MSG so it's fine with me. The egg roll was also delicious. Fried crunchy on the outside and filled with cabbage and diced pork. I hate getting one rice grain sized piece of meat in my egg rolls - this place packs the meat in. Lovely! 

My only gripe is with the condiments. You'd think with egg rolls, they'd either have sauce on the table or give you sauce with it. It's like getting fries - ketchup must be available. But no, we had to ask for it. Even then, they came out with ONE tiny bowl of duck sauce for three people who each had an egg roll. Come on now. We asked for chili oil and were given the same amount. We asked for more of both sauces and was given the same amount again - we asked for more a third time and again, the same amount. Really? Just bring us some sauces!!!! 
One star off for that. I mean, they gave us sauces each time we asked but the second time, we made It clear we're saucy people (pun intended) but they made no change to their portion. We would've asked a fourth time but the servers didn't seem too happy. 

Overall, we'll definitely go back but will make sure to ask for FIVE portions of sauce beforehand."}
{"text":"Seafood delight was okay. The rice tasted like it was reheated a few times. Overall, the food and service was just okay"}
{"text":"Has the best chow fun here. Very large portions and excellent service 
I go at least twice a month"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in town (IMO). The take-out service is pretty accurate to the pickup time that's given when I call in my order. The sweet n sour chicken with the sauce on the side blows me away. The food is super fresh and hot."}
{"text":"The food is decent and it comes very, very quickly, as did the after effects."}
{"text":"I've been to House of Leng a couple of times. I've ordered the shrimp and broccoli and the chicken and broccoli at both lunch and dinner. The lunch  prices are decent for all that's included. The dinner prices not so much. 

While they are the best choice for Chinese in the area with great service and fresh veggies, their food is often too salty and heavy on the sauce.  Dishes that most places serve saut√©ed (like the aforementioned) they serve fried which isn't necessarily desirable for a moderately healthy option. 

The interior is always clean and the staff are always pleasant, attentive and prompt. It's a great option for a quick lunch with a few specifications (i.e. Sauce in the side, not fried, etc). 

Still hankering for a go to Chinese restaurant in the area. Hopefully I'll stumble across a great one soon. For now I'll settle for House of Leng."}
{"text":"Well, I'm so disappointed in my service and food from house of leng I don't feel like being extremely detailed in my review :( 

No one in my family enjoyed their dishes , everything seemed old and tasted the same and we all ordered 3 different meals. What happened they use to be yummy? How do you mess up orange shrimp, why call it orange if the sauce is dark brown ? Why was the walnut shrimp the same as the chili shrimp with tons of walnuts laid on top of it ?

Enough ..."}
{"text":"Really? 5 times? Yelp says I only checked-in 5 times, but I used to go to Leng's all the time. In fact, my wife and I love some of the stuff on their menu so much, that we drive from downtown for 20 minutes to eat there on weekdays.

Thee dishes: Crispy Scallion Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Veggie Lo Mein. They are insanely good. Prices are reasonable, they have Asahi, and everything comes out hot in good portions. I recommend these guys all the time."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience here.  I came on a weekend night and got sat right away.  The service was prompt.  There was no wait on getting the food and it came out hot and fresh. 

My lo mein was a decent size portion for the price.  The egg-rolls taste great And I was overall happy with my visit and would try again."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food around Charlotte. Right next to a nice little lake, pretty good for dates. Wine vault is close as well. 

I recommend the chicken eggplant! Hard to get this item from other places. Please give it a shot."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting this restaurant. I ordered the general tso's chicken and an order of crab Rangoon.  The crab Rangoon was adequate. It wasn't bad but definitely not the best I've had. The general tso's chicken was kind of chewy and my glass with my drink in it looked very dirty. However, the service was very good."}
{"text":"AWESOME... pretty much addicted to their pepper steak.  I order through foodie call and they never dissappoint, food is always fresh and delicious!!"}
{"text":"this is my absolute favorite chinese place. every year i come to charlotte this is my go to place and i always buy extra to take home and freeze. i highly recommend it and its fairly cheap!"}
{"text":"General Chicken is the best dish ever; I can have it everyday. Other ones are also good."}
{"text":"This is the top Americanized Chinese food in charlotte. It comes out slightly slower than others, but the sauces have more flavor and variety and the tofu and veggies seem slightly more fresh than Taipei south. The crispy scallion tofu is the best, but there are tons of options for veggie dishes here."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and they are usually good... Today I ordered Crispy Noodles for lunch and that was a BIG MISTAKE!  I usually get Crispy Noodles at a nearby Vietnamese restaurant and it is really good, so I decided to try it here.  That won't happen again..  The noodles were 'extra crispy' in some areas and the noodles in the middle were oily and inedible.  I meannnnn its not like I wont eat here again, because I know I will... Its just I was really looking forward to some tasty golden fried crispy noodles."}
{"text":"Great food. Average service. A bit overpriced. Worth it when you want quality Chinese food."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorites. Order delivery from here through both seamless and postmates. Delivery is terrible from here. Called to explain concerns with items missing from the order and condiments and placed on hold a terribly long time waiting. Customer service is the cornerstone of any successful business and they're definitely lacking it. Unless this is fixed this will be my last order from them..."}
