{"text":"The Arizona Balloon Classic SUCKED. This Arizona Balloon Classic was Advertising 50 Hot air Balloons there was 15, a little sort. What a waste of time and money $7.00 to Park and $10.00 to get in the gate to watch 15 Balloons go up and float away and land in less about 15 to 20 Min. What a Waste Extremely Disappointed.  Never doing that again.  Just 12 Venders a lot of Dirt and mud. If I was the Wild Horse Pass I would be so embarrassed or is this typical for the Wild Horse Pass to put on such an Expensive Crappy Event.
 I would stay Clear of Wild Horse Pass Events they are a waste of Your MONEY and Your TIME.
Who Ever Writes they had fun is involved in the event. This Event WAS A BUST"}
{"text":"So fun. Was visiting 2 years ago some family in town and we went here. Get a sarsaparilla as you watch the young kids in your family ride the donkeys. Really cool, especially since there isn't anything like this where I live. (Not that NB isn't a bad place to live!)"}
{"text":"Steak ok, overpriced, pecan pie almost inedible"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to check out rawhide and while the atmosphere and theme of everything was pretty cool, the food wasn't that great. We tried the rocky mountain oysters since I've never tried it before. It had no flavor to it other than the breading and even that wasn't anything spectacular. The steak was bland althought cooked correctly to my request (med rare). The ribs were ok too. They had a sweet glaze to them not the usual BBQ sauce. I did enjoy the corn on the cobb, Texas toast, and smashed potatoes."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. From the show, restaurants and fun attractions. Good family fun for all ages"}
{"text":"Saw a news story on local FOX station this am and decided to try Rawhide for dinner while we were in Arizona. 

Made reservations and had no wait. Plenty of room and open tables. Great service! Had ribeye and it was good.  Real horseradish.  Fried pickles were excellent.   BBQ chicken was moist. 

Kids meals available. Preteen had the kids steak and it was more than enough. Teen and I couldn't finish our meals, 

Best part of meal wasn't on the regular menu. The kids menu had s'mores on it. They bring a small pot to your table so you can roast your own marshmallows, then assemble. Kids and adults loved it!

Bought all day wristbands to ride stage coach, climb rock wall, ride the bull and watch the gun shows. Loved the Christmas decor and seeing Santa. Everyone that worked there was extremely friendly and helpful.  We were really surprised at how few people were visiting, but it may have been due to the cold.  They had cool fire pits setup everywhere to stay warm.  Our teen son said he had the best time! So glad we went during our trip!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE BLOWS. They are playing Mexican music on 4th of July... Not even speaking English. There is stuff for sale and over priced food. Weight limit on everything. Horrible waste of money"}
{"text":"One star is generous! Do not waste your money or your time here. Went here for Easter lunch and shows. Got suckered into the Worst buffet in Phoenix. Wish we knew that they had bar food 100 yards past the steakhouse. But it probably sucks too! All the employees were rude and clearly did not want to be there. We had a party of 7 which gets 35% gratuity added on for terrible service. I know its a tourist trap so they don't have to impress but this was just awful. The guy at the rock wall was mean to the kids, the guy at the gold panning was rude to everyone. When some moms parked their strollers by his booth he said \"I guess this is stroller parking\" what a jerk. 
If you want great food and ambience go to San Tan Flats. If you want cowboy shows either drive to Tombstone or just watch the movie."}
{"text":"Pretty neat place! 
I went with my wife to check it out. We didn't see any of the shows, or eat, but a very cool place nonetheless. They have some retired movie set fronts there, and its set up like an Old West Town. 
A place we will go back to for some of the Western Shows and dinner. 
I'd say a very cool place to take kids and out of town friends. 
Parking is $5, entrance to the town is free. 

***No Firearms Allowed***"}
{"text":"SANTA is there this year! And I know they will put on a spread this year for Thanksgiving, so if you don't have plans for Thanksgiving day, this is the place to go. They do a great spread, and have a wonderful show, with an AMAZING Santa, who has been there since they were in Scottsdale. They even have a photo company now, so you don't have to take your own pictures (though the pictures are a little pricier than I like, $10 each, so bring your credit card!). 

Great atmosphere, including roasting marshmallows, and cowboys roaming around. Bring your warm clothes, including mittens and hats, as the temps get into the 40's at night, and colder into the Christmas holiday. I loved my evening, and even tried the rattlesnake. (Brave me!)"}
{"text":"We ate at the saloon and it's was by far the worst service we have ever had. The servers never even look in your direction. It took 35 min for our food. We waited forever for our bill and I finally walked up to the bar to get our bill...there was no one at the bar and they kept walking by me. My husband complained and they took 10% off our bill. Will never eat there agai n!"}
{"text":"So much fun!
We went on a surprisingly cooler evening in July, and it was almost empty but still really fun. I was told that it gets very crowded in the winter months. We didn't get the wristband, but if you're staying for a few hours it's probably a good idea. The stores and attractions are pretty reasonably priced. We got \"married\" for $10, and the ceremony actually lasted longer than some real weddings I've been to! Also bought some beers, fudge, and souvenirs. It's very kitsch, but if you let yourself get in the spirit and have fun, it's a blast!"}
{"text":"The worst 4th of July EVER!!!

They don't let you bring in any food and beverages, yet YOU HAVE TO WAIT 2-3 HOURS IN LINE TO GET A BITE OF FOOD!!!!!

There are only 3 locations to eat: Steakhouse (avg wait time 2-3 hours), pizza place (the line was as long as the grill), the grill: We waited 1 hour in the line, when we made it to the cashier, we learned that we have to wait another hour to get our food!!!!

We had to feed the little one with popcorn, yet we had to wait in line even for that!!! Our 4th of July celebration was literally waiting in the line...

I had good memories with Rawhide in the past but never again... DON'T PAY TO GET INSULTED!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my husband for dinner. We waited 1 hour for a table. We were finally seated at 8:30pm. The place was not busy at all. Half the restaurant was empty. So not sure why the wait. There were 4 hostesses standing around and several very bored looking bus boys. They failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option. Ordered a steak with loaded bake potatoe and sauté mushrooms. When food was brought out, they informed me that they were out of potatoes and mushrooms. A steak house with no potatoes. Really???  So I paid full price for a very sad steak dinner. My plate consisted of a very good steak and a piece of soggy Texas toast."}
{"text":"The Steakhouse at Rawhide Western Town, Wild Horse Pass provided the best food! Truly not what I expected from Rawhide but what a pleasant surprise. I have now eaten there 4 times and each time it has been tasty and good, I highly recommend it and if they have the rattlesnake you have to try it!"}
{"text":"Can't say anything about the food - we got the activity pass and it kept the kids pretty busy.  Saw a simulated gun show (spoiler - the guy falls off the roof), climbed a wall, rode a donkey, panned for gold, got horsehoes made at the blacksmith, watched my son cry when he fell off a bull and was humiliated - great times!  I will say that we were not thrilled with the gold panning - we've done it at another place and actually had to dig in and find little bits of gold.  At this place they stick about 4 big chunks of fake stuff in the sand for you to find - it's great for a three year old but my 8 year old budding geologist wanted a little more."}
{"text":"First, they should've changed the name when they moved to the Chandler location. It's not the same fun-loving old west town that it use to be. Very few employees in character, there is no spontaneous wild west action because all shows are scheduled and cost, the shops are modernized, and there is little to see and do. The sweet shop has delicious fudge and chocolates but has lost all of it's old west charm and has given into commercialized brands. There really is no consideration given to capturing and maintaining the Old West Rawhide.
We went to the Blue Collar Beerfest & Backyard BBQ, which in itself was a disgrace to the beer and BBQ world. (One BBQ food truck and I will spare you the tacky beer details) There was no country music, grunge rock bands played. Even in the saloon they were playing top rock hits! While I love rock music, it was not befitting to the supposed theme of Rawhide. There were even timeshare vendors and massage chair kiosks set-up in the town! We ate in the steak house since the BBQ selection was minimal and the line was extremely long, about 40 plus. My fiance had to return his \"smoked\" chicken because it was very mushy. There was no hint of smoke to the chicken, it was in the sauce. He did enjoy the sides though. The salad and rolls reminded me of cafeteria food. Yucky...However, my prime rib was as good as I remember it though and the waiter was great. I was happy to see some of the artifacts from the old brought here to the new location, like the bar and saloon entrance.
We will not return. I do not want my memories of the wonderful Old West Rawhide ruined."}
{"text":"The website should have something saying if there is rain they are not going to open.  We drove 45 minutes from a hotel to find out cowboys don't go outside in the rain.  When I called to see if they were going to open, they said the following day.  Since this is a tourist place, most people can't return.  At least make a daily voicemail, and put on the website to call to verify hours and if the place is open.  Too bad you can't give negative stars."}
{"text":"This place is great for families with children. It's a replica of an old Midwestern town and theres actors that put on gun shows, but just remember to tell the kiddies it's only make believe lol. The food was average nothing over the top which I wasn't expecting it to be. The menu mainly consists of burgers, BBQ, steak, salad, shrimp ect. I had the salmon with veggies, it was good.  Because it was about 20 of us, we got seated in a room with a bar and a band. The kids loved it because we were the only people in the room and the singer allowed the kids to dance next to them. Everyone had a great time, it's a place though that u only go once to, and I'm glad we went."}
{"text":"I thought it was sort of strange to hear gunshots without the accompanying sound of screeching tires.  But hey, I can adapt.

This isn't exactly Disneyland, so if you're looking for something that'll amuse you and the kids all day, that probably isn't Rawhide.  But it is still a fun place for the kids to burn off an afternoon while you stroll up and down the dusty Main Street and try to avoid getting jailed.

You'll find margarita stands, fine food, an old tyme saloon, and guys going by \"Tex\" and \"Dutch\" shooting at each other.  This can alarm Grandma, so make sure she's forewarned.

The performers here are uniformly terrific and constantly in character.  Kids love this stuff, and they make it fun for playful adults as well.  Activities include burro rides, a train ride, gold panning, and the like.  There are shows that vary in time, be sure to grab a flyer by the entrance that gives you a rundown of what show is at what time.

There is no fee for parking or for entry.  You pay for tickets to the various attractions, meaning you can meander around and enjoy the ambiance without spending a dime if you're a real cheapskate.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)"}
{"text":"Went to the steakhouse the meal was average but the atmosphere was fun with live music.  Then went to the western town/amusement park had grandparents in from out of town and kids with us.  They were having a \"Dirty Disco\" there that night the \"street\" was literally filled with hundreds of teenagers walking around dressed extremely inappropriately, yelling back and forth about doing drugs and rave music blaring in the background.  Left after an hour was not a family friendly environment nor worth the money for armbands etc."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Rawhides Doom Town last Friday night and it was so much fun. We did both haunted houses and the \"Train of Terror\". My 10 year old daugter was so scared before we even got into the 1st haunted house but then she had such a great time although she got a little scared at times. If you want a truly scary experience this is not for you. It is great Halloween fun for familys. My favorite part was the train ride. There were houses and buildings set up like a ghost town with dead people and eery lights. It was really fun."}
{"text":"Howdy. My 4 year old and 2 year old loved it. There was a lot of activities for them to do: train rides, mini roller coaster, swings, petting zoo, pan for gold, wagon rides and much more. The all activity bracket was perfect for hem. The gun show was entertaining. I wish it was a little longer but they have multiple shows that are all different. Some of the snack stands closed early which I wish we would have known."}
{"text":"Before I moved out, I had read about Rawhide in the tour books.  It was different from what I expected.  Not different-bad, just different.  First, it's for kids.  I didn't go with kids, but you probably should to get the most out of it.  All the shows and the little stands (like the mechanical bull and the rock climbing wall) are geared toward the under 10 set, and it would be fun to see it through their eyes.  It is also much smaller than I expected.  The piped-in music played the \"Rawhide\" theme over and over, which I kind of loved, since I had been singing it in my head the whole drive over anyway.  I guess my final answer is this:  It's a cute theme experience, and it's something you should definitely do once, but I don't plan on going again.  In fact, when my extended family comes to visit this fall, they want to see cowboys, but I plan on finding different cowboys to show them.  Tombstone, maybe?"}
{"text":"I love Rawhide! My family can spend the entire day there watching the shows, visiting the attractions, and just hanging out and watching people go by. The margarita guy is great and don't even get me started on the fudge! It's always affordable, we usually spend less then $100  a day, which is pretty good for a family of three and whole day off food and entertainment!"}
{"text":"This was such a fun day for our family.  Lots of fun for the kids.  They couldn't decide whether they liked the panning for gold, petting zoo, hayride with fun stories or the rock wall the best.  My favorite was the shotgun wedding we set up as a surprise for my boyfriend.  The kids got a real kick out of the judge, I.M. Mental.  They have several different things you can set up for a surprise like the shotgun wedding.  Just go into the jail and ask.  So fun!

All the employees were amazing and friendly and I think the live western shows were better here than at the OK Corral in Tombstone.

Hats off to a fun-filled fantastic time!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Themed to the old west. The food was great. Wait staff were genuinely nice and in character. Live music was average, but they take requests. Great place to take large groups, a lot of open space. They had a private party area that included a game room with a cowboy themed pool table room."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Rawhide so I was not sure what to expect. $20 got me pretty much the run of the town. The gun fight show are awesome and looked real with added humor!! Was not sure if 9 year old daughter would enjoy it but she did so we will be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Nowhere in the materials online or in our travel book did it say this place is closed due to inclement weather.  Would it be so hard to put a \"ticker\" on your website with this information if you do in fact close?  AZ has so few days of really poor weather, I know... but for those few days, help a tourist out, right?

Needless to say, deciding to brave the weather, my fiancee and I drove down from Scottsdale (a 45 minute drive from the north end of town) only to find a \"closed\" sign on the main sign.  The outside looked nice--I'm sure it is a stellar place-- but will never know.  :(

The had on their website closed for an event that evening, so the closed for the day due to weather is a no-brainer.  Sorry Rawhide..."}
{"text":"town grill that has the footlong dogs and,burgers has not the best service. extremely slow waited 30 mins for hot dogs, people after us got their food first and he didnt even remember i
our order.... 1 guy taking orders and making food. not,ok"}
{"text":"Just brought my family out here for thanksgiving! What a blast! All you can eat thanksgiving buffet that was absolutely phenomenal, live shows, bull riding, train rides & pictures with Santa! The kids had such a good time! Had to practically drag them out of there! Definitely a great place for the whole family! 

P.S. The steakhouse is must if you're ever in town! And the live cowboy shows are awesome, they have some very talented actors!"}
{"text":"Closed,  except for special events.   We just made a trip out there from mesa, az, and we talked with the security guard.   What a shame."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the Rawhide Doomtown. I would not recommend going on a Thursday night.  $14.95 per kid for the wrist band to do all the activities except the Kidz Zone with all the fun stuff for kids was not open on Thursday and the Hayride was not open on Thursday.  To see any show adults would have to buy $5 tickets each to go in with the kids.  Also to ride the stagecoach the kids couldn't go alone so that would have been $5 more per adult.  The shooting gallery was extra and the coffin ride was extra.  Lot's of hidden costs and closed attractions that they did not disclose on the website.  The restaurant seemed overpriced as well so we left and ate somewhere else.  I'm normally not a cheap person, but this place seemed like a rip off.

On a positive note, the actors dressed up and walking around were great.  Very scary and realistic."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night about 9pm and it was 30 seconds before we were seated. I ordered a prickly pear margarita and it was gone in about 5 minutes. So good!! Coconut shrimp was SLAMMIN' good, wedge salad with chipotle blue cheese dressing delicious, and our steaks were better than Schula's. 

Our server DOC :) was professional and attentive. He was around when we needed him and not breathing over our necks during our mean. Our food started coming out in 10 minutes after our initial order and everyone was so nice. 

We will def be back soon! One of the best restaurants we've been to in a while."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our vacation.  There was a beer and wine tasting event the night we were there that really ruined the atmosphere.  The food at the steakhouse was ok for how expensive it was.  The stores had the usual western flair but also very overpriced. The western show wasn't too bad, good for kids."}
{"text":"I was in AZ for the thanksgiving weekend and we checked out Rawhide.  It was really fun.  Lots of nice stuff in the gift shops but expensive, as it usually is.

I felt like I was a kid again, panning for gold and rock climbing.  I even rode a mechanical bull for the first time ever.

My kids loved it and I'm glad I went!"}
{"text":"I use to go here all the time once it opened in fall.  Now I learn that it is closed except for special events or holiday special events . Whoever is in charge just buried this ghost town AGAIN......This will close due to lack of vision .  You can't promote something if your closed all the time.   Really.......,Invest in this place, this use to be a great place 5 years ago.  Gone down hill every year ......"}
{"text":"-0 if they had it.   Standing On line for the Freestyle concert.   VIP too.  Doors open led at 1pm and we have been standing in line to get through front door for 1 hour.   Great way to treat vip people.  Disgraceful.  At least bring water out to all of us waiting for you to get your crap together.   Show has started and we are still waiting outside"}
{"text":"Absolutely unacceptable. 12 AM. Been going on for hours and will go on another couple more. All of ahwatukee and surrounding areas are being pounded with the noise level from the music fest. And no law enforcement will do anything. Shame on you rawhide. People have kids. People have jobs."}
{"text":"Attended the beer/wine fest a few weeks ago. All of the staff was pleasant. The Santa photo crew was very accommodating. Everyone created a fun and joyful Christmas-western environment.   Overall - a great time!"}
{"text":"If you're torn btwn taking out of towners btwn Rawhide or another event, I'd say pick the other event.  This should be the backup choice, when all has been seen or done and you want to pass an evening with no high expectations with them.  You can read the rest of the reviews of what you are in for.

If there are small kids involved who are still crazing on Toy Story, then I'd lean here."}
{"text":"This place is cool. It has a lot to offer compared to just a regular restaurant. It's an old western little town with a dirt road, shoppes, and a steakhouse which has live country music. There is also a straight up saloon that makes even the biggest city slicker feel like Clint Eastwood.
But wait, there's more! Cowboy sunset cookouts, gunfighter shows and Bull riding! Thats my kind of fun, and still very family friendly. 
1 downside- the rocky dirt parking lot. No heels or flip flops- way too much dirt so pull out those Cowboy boots & have fun."}
{"text":"Just a heads up, they don't publish it, but they will make you throw e-cigs and juice out the door when you come to an event. Screw this place for not publishing this info online before hand. Never returning and filing a formal complaint"}
{"text":"We came here for the Mother's Day Brunch, and it was outstanding!  It was the first time ever that my 1 and 2 year old actually sat through an entire meal without screaming or having to be escorted out before the meal ended.  They played live country music during our meal, which captivated our toddlers.  The tiramisu was among the best I've had in the USA.  Their steak medallions were fantastic - medium to medium rare, tender, and not dry.  Everything I had at the buffet was great, but those two things really stood out to me.  My kids loved the macaroni and cheese, tater tots, pbj sandwich, ice cream sundaes, and cheesecake.  My husband enjoyed the medallions, as well as the prime rib. This is a great family restaurant, and the food was good, to boot!!"}
{"text":"Clearly a fun place to take a big group or the kiddos.  Don't come here for the food.  You come for the atmosphere.  Real old-timey cowboys and gunslingers walk around with serious faces and guns.  The staff is dressed as cowboys/cowgirls.  There's a big dance floor and and old Kenny Rogers looking man on stage strumming a guitar.  I was two large tables of people from work and we had a great time.  Everyone enjoyed singing on stage and dancing to the old country and classic tunes.  At 9pm we made our way outside to watch a gunfight and then everyone took turns riding the mechanical bull.  There were hay bales to sit on and fire pits for warmth.  

As for the food, we had a special menu created for our large group.  We had your typical boring starter salad.  The highlight was the little jalapeno cornbread muffin that came with it.  For my entree I tried the salmon/filet combo.  Both were tiny and overcooked.  My med-rare steak was more medium and my salmon was black and crunchy on the bottom.  The automatic sides were a bowl of beans (which I did not try) and corn on the cob (which I did not get--assuming they dropped it on the floor because there was a greasy spot on my plate from where I believe it had once been).   There was also a piece of toast which I also did not try.  After all that, I decided to skip the apple pie and drink my dessert."}
{"text":"This place has an excellent restaurant! I can't tell you about the other attractions, because we went so late they were all closed. They had friendly staff and nice, live music. They serve steak and other western foods, including rattlesnake. The performer was very nice and let us go on the stage because it was so late and no one else was there. The rooms were nicely decorated relics from the old west."}
{"text":"I want to be a salaried employee here since they are never ever open. True ghost town now. Raves at rawhide? Wth?"}
{"text":"We took out of town guests there last Thursday night.  There were not many people there at all so going through the town was not very exciting.  Dinner at the steakhouse was good.  We made sure to do the rattlesnake and rocky mountain oysters and were rewarded with certificates of completion!
They only have one vegetarian choice which did restrict what our vegetarian could have but it was a huge plate of grilled vegetables of all kinds.
The magician cowboy that came over to our table was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Found out they are now open during special events. Very disappointing. Had a blast last time in 2014. They should open for Spring break the first 2weeks in April. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"If you like to take a few amatuer photos for fun, this is a decent place since it is completely free during days that an event isn't scheduled. We went on a Sunday when there was not a special event scheduled. Parking was free and plentiful but almost nothing was open. Even The steakhouse/saloon was closed for a private church event so really, there was nothing to do for adults except take a walk through and \"see\" the facades. 

There were 40 or so people walking around and no vendors were set up. Only the general store, a saloon with mechanical bull (which was one of the attractions offered), and the old-time photo booth stores were open. All the other attractions that I saw were geared to children under 10 and we would not/could not parttake in. I give it 2 stars because I imagine that really young kids might enjoy it but if you are kid-less you will be bored to tears after 10 minutes. I'm glad I was able to get a refund from Groupon. No need for me to ever go back."}
{"text":"the steak looked gray ... not a good looking steak for the price Applebee's has better steak then this place .... the place is packed not enough servers ... we got minimum to no service at all had to get up and get him to bring us some water ... I give it 2 stars only bc I really enjoyed the band"}
{"text":"Nice place.. We went there for a corporate event and it is a huge place. Pretty much a whole tone dine in western style. The street has little stores for souvenirs and treats. There are people in character to help with the western theme. We spent a few hours between the train ride and petting zoo plus other things so there is enough to keep a family occupied. Diner was better than expected we had barbecue chicken, salmon and it tasted better than it looked. For dessert we had apple cobbler with ice cream. Though it was more apple than cobbler in it. Overall it was a nice time, don't know about prices or other menu items but looks like a near place for a family to send a few hours"}
{"text":"Flat iron steak was darn good at a nice price. Only reason it isn't a 5 is because the beer selection stinks and the saloon was dead."}
{"text":"It's okay,  It's a fun adventure for the kids and families not for a date."}
{"text":"The place itself is cool, food was pretty bad.  Our waiter clearly doesn't like his job.  The live music was good and just as we were about to leave, a magician showed up at our table and he was totally incredible.  I've never seen anything like it in person and thought that stuff you see on tv was staged. I guess it's not.   He had us so confused.  He made that visit a 3 instead of a 1.  Probably won't go back, but will recommend that magician for a work function.  I still can't get over how great he was."}
{"text":"The center cut sirloin was perfectly cooked medium rare and the green beans were SO good! The rosemary crusted prime rib is to die for.
Calli always makes my jalapeño margarita perfectly!
The service is always very friendly and the food is so amazing! We love making s'mores at our dinner table, too :-D"}
{"text":"$5 parking. And the \"rides\" are not cheap. There's a $15 wristband. But there's not much to get on or do. And they charge for the some of the shows. The town itself is really sad. 

We asked the guy by the mechanical horses for change. He was funny and talked my dad into getting like $10 worth of quarters. My dad being a nice guy went along with it. Come to find out none of the horses worked. He saw all the kids on them. I know because he made a joke about them being on Siesta. Jerk."}
{"text":"Rawhide Steakhouse was awesome!
My daughter was visiting from out of town and we decided to go there  before she left AZ  :)
We are so glad we did! :)
The 'town\" is cheesy but you have to expect that from an \"attraction\". We thought it was a couple of notches better than Knott's Berry Farm Calico Gold mine area.
The Sheriff and company made us laugh and the town was a quick walk through but it is a small venue and we think it would probably be better during the weekend with more folks roaming around.
We skipped the wristbands and shopped and explored. It was very nice.
The Steakhouse was WOW!
It was a rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. Checkered table clothes and gas lamps for lighting on the table.
We were seated quickly and must have gotten there at the right time for dinner since 5-10 minutes later lots of people showed up.
Our server was quick and brought the salads really fast. Not to self: Skip the salad since the entrees are rather large.
I ordered the Veggie platter thinking $13 was a tad expensive for a veggie platter (the only real option for Vegetarians) but it was DELISH! There was LOTS of asparagus on the platter with all kinds of seasonal veg and the veggies were not frozen!
My other half ordered a rib eye thinking he would never find a decent piece of steak again and was pleasantly surprised. LOL, I am so used to him turning down steaks due to chewiness and fat and this one he said  had flavor ,was very tender, was seasoned perfectly and cooked as ordered. Best steak he has had in years.
 He regrets not ordering the Porterhouse but thought it would disappoint.  It is definitely next on his list to order there!
My daughter had the chocolate cake. It was moist, rich and filling. No complaints.
We even enjoyed live entertainment! :)  Hubby was extremely pleased when he heard Ghost Riders being played.
Yes, we will be back for dinner again, most likely on the weekend. 
If you have out of town guests, it might be a bit typical of an attraction, but the people that work there made sure we were all having fun and the food was great. You might want to give it a try!
I'm glad it took my special visitor for us to finally stop talking about going there and actually doing it!"}
{"text":"I remember when Rawhide was way up north. It seemed more fun then - especially when this wild west lady was following our group around and heckling every single one of us. Came here recently for the Riverwalk Wine & Food Festival @ Rawhide. That was a complete clusterfarkle requiring most people to stand in the hot sun for an hour just to purchase tickets to get in. Line was so slow moving we thought every customer got a \"happy ending\" before proceeding to the festival grounds. Every staff member associated with the festival complained how disorganized it was. We didn't stay too long - just long enough for me to get fecal-faced enough to shout weird things out the window at every pedestrian on our ride back - or so they claim. But really the Rawhide folks aren't to blame - in fact they should be commended for entertaining us in line when they weren't actually even part of the festival. One of the Rawhide guys let a prop gun go off loudly - startling everyone around and blamed it on a car nearby backfiring. LOL. I thought it was hilarious. 
Enough about the \"festival\" I came a little while back with a co-worker to the actual Steakhouse and we had some pretty good steaks. For appetizers we had rattlesnake fritters and mountain oysters. They give you a lot of both. Waitress claimed we were being brave that night. LOL. My co-worker just kind of had a bit of both so I ended up eating most of the apps. I had so many balls and pieces of snake in my mouth it was like I was at a lemonparty or something. LOL. The band playing country music that night was pretty good too. I'd go again if I had an out-of-town visitor that wants the whole wild wild west experience. Lots and lots of dirt parking."}
{"text":"Never disappointed, with the service , the people and of course the food..I absolutely love the live country music playing while your having dinner"}
{"text":"I don't give poor reviews unless it's really deserved. This is definitely deserved. Went to the lights of the world lantern festival at rawhide with my wife and elderly Aunt. Didn't have high expectations but my Aunt really wanted to check it out. It was an overpriced Asian experience that cost extra for everything. Parking was even extra. And the ticket price didn't include tax. A real rip off."}
{"text":"Our first time there to visit.  Went for the Easter brunch. We made reservations. We looked online beforehand for different menus and restaurants to visit when choosing where to go for our holiday meal. We were very excited by what was presented online. We were however disappointed after the experience. The service was lacking, little help for the amount of people there., and wait staff was slow.  The food/ buffet was set up in chafing dishes and open so some of it was cold and the steak was tough and overcooked.  They had an omelet station but only two people to help for the dozens of people, making the wait almost 15-20 mins for some people.
The waitstaff were nice but slow and inattentive.  The town had a lot of great activities esp for the kids however, we will not spend our holiday there again."}
{"text":"Family and I had dinner at Rawhide on a Sunday evening in late June, not crowded at all. We decided to experience everything offered, so we bought wristbands for the kids and show tickets for the adults. I really enjoyed this place, food was very good, I ate half a rack of ribs, corn on the cob, and baked beans-no complaints whatsoever, the food was very good. Walking down Main Street (I believe the path is called Main Street, feel free to correct me) and each side of the \"street\" has shops all appropriately themed. There was a gun fight as we walked in, highly entertaining. The kids panned for gold, climbed the rock wall, spent some time in the petting zoo, visited the blacksmith, and then had me arrested at the local jail. Very entertaining and fun. We finished the evening at the show which was corny, but, very fun. Audience participation is highly encouraged and helps move the show along. We spent about 4 hours at Rawhide and did not get around to every shop. I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I really like Rawhide. It's a cutesy, western themed fart in the middle of nowhere.

It's free to get in, and you can buy a wristband for all the attractions. My 3 year old totally digs it. 

We've eaten once in the restaurant (pretty good, but expensive) and once in the little cafe (pretty good, too!). Your best bet is to eat somewhere else, then come and go crazy in the candy shop. Oh, dear, sweet Jesus, they have every kind of candy you can remember. Everything! That's mommy's favorite part. 

It's usually pretty empty, which is nice. We usually feel we have most of the place to ourselves.

Their show in the saloon is loud, but pretty entertaining. 

Be careful around Halloween with the young ones. They don't mind scaring the shit out of kids, plus their train tunnel is full of scary things (I just told mine \"quick cover your eyes! It's covered in POOP!\")."}
{"text":"This review is for the Steakhouse only.  By the time we got there we were too late to tour around the town.  The Steakhouse was okay.  We came because we had an out of towner and thought this would be a good place to try something \"Arizonan\", ie. Rattlesnake.  Well, we ordered the rattlesnake appetizer, and I can't say we could even tell it was rattlesnake.  It was deep fried, and a small portion.  It basically looked like mini popcorn chicken. We each ordered a steak (they are known for their T-bone), and it was again okay.  Nothing great, but not bad.  It was nicely seasoned, but definitely doesn't compare to some of the nicer steakhouses in the valley.  You get a much more \"rustic\" feel to the steak.  The restaurant wasn't super busy, yet the service was still slow. So, be ready to slow down and take in the Wild Wild West and not expect speedy fast paced service."}
{"text":"I visited Rawhide recently and was less than impressed. The little town is a shadow of what it once was and you are hit with having to pay for every single part of the experience. 

The worst part is they now have loud tecno parties that run into the early hours and are quite annoying."}
{"text":"Not your average tourist trap, no sir. Shee-oot this place was fun. Five stars for a lot of different things, but mostly the fact that these folk are in period dress and character, no matter how many degrees over 100 it is outside. That is dedication right there. This charming old west town has a lot to offer travelers, from fresh margaritas (\"25 year old original recipe!!\" bellows the guy from the shop window, as he lays into his dinner bell.), to taking your picture on a replica electric chair, to watching wild west shootouts in the street. 

\"We've been here 10 minutes and already someone's been kilt,\" lamented my host, tour guide, and resident bf of the bff, as we moseyed into the general store. I was looking at shot glasses for myself and my gentleman caller and cat babysitter back home, when one of the \"locals\" snuck up behind me and startled me by asking if I was planning to steal anything. HA. Hilarious. They never break character. I appreciate how the general store is the first stop, and inside you can also ask questions and buy tickets for the attractions. You can purchase a ticket for each attraction, or a bundle for a bunch of them. As it was roughly one thousand degrees outside (or \"normal\" as the locals insisted), we opted for the outdoor show and a mechanical bull ride. 

I lasted about 25 seconds on the mechanical bull, and was offered two more tries, one of which I used. I had never done that before and having the chance to was great! No matter how hard I failed. The live entertainment spectacle was pretty fun. Lots of cheesy humor and gunfights. There was even an opportunity to get flyers autographed by the actors. Cute. I was told I couldn't have one because I was wearing a Giants jersey. I said 1889 World Series Champions FTW and made the guy laugh.

It was really too stinkin' hot to do much else, so we made our way over to the Rawhide Steakhouse for some grub. This restaurant is actually really nice and offers some good food along with some....err...novelty items. We ordered fried rattlesnake and Rocky Mountain Oysters, with a side of jalapeno coins and delicious jalapeno cornbread. The \"oysters\" (read: fried bull testes) were actually kind of good. Chewy, but good. Rattlesnake was reminiscent of calamari. They even gave us little certificates to showcase that we ate these things. For dessert, we got to roast our own smore's!

All in all, Rawhide may be cheesy for some or seen as a tourist trap, but they really pull out all the stops here to deliver an enjoyable unique experience. I almost feel like I got a legit time travel trip to the PG rated Old West!"}
{"text":"My family and I drive over half an hour to get to here because we were told it's a nice place and it was CLOSED on a Saturday. We called and the hotel we were staying at called to make sure it's open and the recording said it's open. We got there and it was deserted! I can't believe how unprofessional a place can be to not have a recording properly state closures. We basically wasted half of our day! Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Rawhide at the new location it is nothing like it was in Scottsdale. Yes they have more space, but no people are even there. Please know that my husband and our grandsons enjoyed the few hours because they are 5 years old and they always like a new adventure.
Rawhide please check your Yelps. Your Steakhouse House the food was fine, but the Server that we had was fair at best his name was (Ty) Tristan. I gave him our completed bill with cash
he waited on the table next to me and took all of there orders on (7) customers, then he never returned with our change. My husband took our very well behaved grandsons outside because they had become to chilly in the dinning room. They were outside for 20 minutes, my husband comes back in to find out what is taking so very long to just pay for our order. He was able to get the attention of another employee to get our change. I have lived in North Scottsdale for (13) years I have never ever seen this type of behavior.  
***Also at the Front I do not see that Rawhide is that busy that you need reservation to eat at The Steakhouse.***"}
{"text":"The pulled pork BBQ is outstanding and comes at a very reasonable price!

If you combine excellent food with great value AND the old west ambiance this re-created town offers the combination = EXCELLENT!

This is a great place for the family (i.e. petting zoos, hay rides, shootouts, etc.) or a group of adults who want to enjoy some BBQ and beer. 

Give it a try!  You'll enjoy the day."}
{"text":"I haven't been to rawhide since it was at it's former location. So I was shocked at how they dumbed this place down. You don't have as many actors, and thing to do with the kids like you used to. It is much smaller. But the Christmas lights and music were cool, and there was hardly any one there. Which was nice for walking, but bad for business. We were charged for parking. That's new too. .....sigh........"}
{"text":"Total. Waste.of.Time.



The Rawhide western town was an old-school attraction in way north scottsdale years and years ago, then it moved to the gila river indian reservation about 8 years ago, and it is NOT the same. The old rawhide was three times the size of this one and had way more attractions and things to do, especially as a kid. 

Went to this new location for the first time with company...it was lame, bordering on pathetic. This rawhide at wild horse pass is tiny, it is basically one big steakhouse, with 4 little overpriced gift shops down the dirt street. The petting zoo is tiny and boring, the games are boring, the old west shows cost now, and everything requires a \"wristband\" that costs 15 bucks. For what?? the two rides you have? No man.

The old rawhide had free shows, free attractions, and a lot more atmosphere, this place was sad and a ripoff. The parking costs 5 dollars, god knows why it's just a big dirt lot, and everything inside is hotel-markup price.

Total waste of time, unless you are 3 years old you will not enjoy this place. Skip this place and rent \"tombstone\" on dvd, it's worth the time and money, unlike rawhide."}
{"text":"This is such a strange place.  It has so much potential... I was expecting west world & kinda got the bare minimum of old west.  So we walked in on a Sunday afternoon... the place seemed to be decked out for Christmas so that was fun but it was a serious ghost town.  I saw a couple of guys dressed up in western gear but wasn't sure if they worked there or not.  Nothing seemed to be open.  I've heard they're starting to hold concerts & festivals which seems really weird but I guess it's hard times for rawhide.  Why are the chainsmokers performing here?  This is not Vegas.  Oh well, stick to tombstone."}
{"text":"I haven't been to rawhide in many years. Even at it's newer location it is still is a great play to take out of town visitors. Where the pavement ends and the west begins. The town and people look like they are from an old west movie. Rawhide is like stepping back in time. It allows you to forget all your troubles during your visit. 
 ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 
4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 
3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH"}
{"text":"Tried to go to Rawhide tonight but they have a sign that says it's closed til September.  The website says it's open. I'm disappointed and now searching for somewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Had a fun day! Gun fight show was fun to watch."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have known about this place if it weren't for an organized event from a conference I was attending in Phoenix. On a Thursday night, we pretty much took over the place. 

The inside decor was what I'd expect it to be with historical pictures and such. Food portions were beyond generous. One of my favorite parts were the \"cowboys\" whether they were \"real\" or not, did a fantastic job playing the role and conversing with each table. I even took pictures with them!

Since we were such a large group, there were ample activities throughout the night. After dinner, folks had the opportunity to line dance as the dining area was converted to a dance floor. Free lessons provided. 

I chose to explore the outside festivities after eating such a hearty meal. Since I went around the holidays, Santa made an appearance, as well as making it snow! \"Real\" snow was blowing off the rooftop. As I kept walking, 2 cowboys were having a draw and bang bang, 1 is on the ground, but soon after back alive!

Mini museums with cool artifacts and \"jails\" made for fun photo opportunities. My favorite part was the petting zoo area. I got to make new donkey friends (Lena and George.) They were nothing but friendly! 

All the staff members I encountered were happy to be there, service with a smile. This venue is off the beaten path, but I'd give it a whirl. I also saw lots of coupons for Rawhide from various tourist brochures/marketing materials."}
{"text":"Great Steaks! My favorite is still the T-bone... Also order the jalapeno muffins."}
{"text":"Not for everyone. Although I think kids would have a decent time here, for 2 adults looking for something to do, Rawhide doesn't have much to offer. We paid $5 for parking and spent about 30 minutes walking through the \"town\" and took a few pictures. But we really could have gone without. I wouldn't recommend putting this on your to do list for the area but if you're really into the western theme, I suppose you'll find town interesting."}
{"text":"The place is fun and really appeals to the cowboy or cowgirl in ya but, the menu is packed with high fat options and is more like cafeteria food than a good restraunt.Too bad they can't provide a more current pyramid selection of foods, entres to match a fresh and healthy alternative and  taste."}
{"text":"wow, we came down for spring training and was looking for something touristy to do that we could bring our little boy to. Admission was free and it as we were walking in this family gave us their armbands they didnt use. Infact they didnt even check our armbands. We didnt eat at the restaurants but did the attractions. Its great for families though."}
{"text":"Worth the wristband price if you have kids 4-12. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. I would recommend it if you're already in the area and are just looking for something to do, but don't travel to go. Here are the good things about it, with the \"bad\" part too. Not really bad, just letting you know what to expect. There were 2 train rides. One was small like the one inside the mall and went in a circle in the middle of the small place. It lasted about 2 minutes. The other one was bigger but just took you along a pond and turned around. It lasted 8 minutes. Neither had tracks. It's free to walk in and see, but if you have kids you should buy the wristband. For the 2 of us, $30 didn't seem too bad and we did actually spend about 2 hours here. It allowed us into the petting zoo that only had 5 animals, the 15 minute gun show which was funny, a mechanical bull ride that my 8 yr old liked, gold panning that was kind of fun for him (basically standing at a horse trough sifting through cold water and dirt for fake gold, but we thought it was cool), access to a room where they told a jail story while another patron was put in jail (to be a participant the guy asked for $15- don't pay that, just be part of the crowd), oh and there was a four person circular swing where the kids sat in it and a guy twisted them around in a circle that moved them up in the air and let them spin down (my son liked this one the most, the attendant was friendly and entertaining as well, not to mention there was a little campfire going by the waiting bench so I just relaxed and watched while he drove the guy crazy because he rode it about ten times, the guy didn't mind either), wall climbing was ok, Santa story and tree lighting, Santa shop and photo with Santa. We did not eat at the restaurant, but only because we had reservations somewhere else. Overall I liked it. Don't pay per attraction, just buy the $15 wristband. Adults, if you see 2/3 of the gun shows it seems worth it. Everyone there was nice, friendly and helpful except the guy in the jail attraction who could care less about you if you didn't want to pay the $15 extra so basically he smiled at one family(not the guy telling the jail story, the one behind the photo counter)."}
{"text":"We were staying at Wild Horse Pass and went to Rawhide for a late dinner our first night in town.  Food and service were very good.  It was not crowded at all.  Walked around the cute 1890's town after we ate but they were closing for the evening so we didn't get to see too much.  I'd like to go back when the town is in full swing."}
{"text":"What a total disappointment. Nowhere as good as the original. IT seemed like a set rather than an actual town. The night we were there not much was open or going on in this place. A couple of store fronts were open with nothing of interest inside.

We also had dinner there that night. Oy vey what generic crap  they were serving. The place feels like an old gym made in to a restaurant with much too loud of music playing. If you were not deaf before you went in you would be for hours after you left.

Man just so disappointing."}
{"text":"This rating is for the park only. 

My wife and I were staying in the area and Rawhide was advertised in many locations. We were free on Sunday morning so we took a short drive to look at the \"old west town\" only to find that it didn't open until noon. We ran a couple of errands and went back to the hotel before going back to Rawhide at noon. Parking and entrance was free.

The \"town\" itself is basically 1 street with some shops on both sides. The gift shop had some unique items and the candy shop sold some decent chocolates and interesting nostalgic candy. Candy was a little pricey but it is a tourist attraction. The blacksmith had some unique items also and we decided to by our teen children engraved leather bracelets ($10 each). The jewelry store seemed to be quite pricey.

As others have said, this is geared more toward children or toward events where the park is just the background. My wife and I spent an hour there and were able to by some candy and a couple of gift, but that was enough time to see the whole \"town\"."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with our lunch at the steakhouse. When looking at the menu posted outside we decided we wanted the prime rib sliders which was on the main menu. When we went to order the waitress said those aren't available for lunch but she would ask the chef. She came back to say they couldn't make them, it was too early. BOOOO The sweet tea had black gook floating at the bottom for starters. Fished it out with my straw and it looked like black slime. The manager came & apologized & offered 20% off our bill,  which was nice. I then ordered a bottled beer to be safe. For food I ordered the Caesar salad with chicken. Way too much dressing on it which made the salad very mushy and the chicken was extremely dry. The croutons were very stale and not crunchy at all.
 My mom had the potato skins which were good, although you could tell the potato had been held at temperature for quite sometime. Didn't taste fresh. 
My son had the kids cheeseburger with fries, which all in all was just OK, nothing spectacular. 

A couple was seated in the booth behind us and asked if they could order the coconut shrimp from the main menu...guess what...they were able to. 
We liked the tourist atmosphere but they seriously need to dust the back of the booths and up the food quality. Our waitress Tammie was great and checked on us often. 

After a few sights & events my son saw Icee Machines at one location & was so excited to have that treat. Buuuut the machines were broken. BOOOO

The gun show was cute, for kids especially. Would like to see more interaction with the crowd.  The petting zoo was lacking. Especially for a $5 entrance fee. 

The bathrooms were clean & well maintained. Shops are WAY over priced and with a $5 parking fee I would have liked to have seen more of the characters interacting & mingling."}
{"text":"One of our family reunion's functions was held here.  This was the only planned outdoor event, being that it was July in Arizona, where the average temp is 130 degrees (or something like that).  So we all got into the spirit of the Ol' West and purchased straw cowboy hats from Walgreens for $5.99, knowing full well that a tourist trap like Rawhide would charge three times that much for the same cheap hat.  I wanted to use the money I saved on my Walgreens hat to ride the mechanical bull, the train, and the stagecoach-supposedly $5 for each \"attraction\".  I'm a tourist trap's dream customer wherever I'm away from home.  I love all things cheesy, touristy, kitschy, campy.  So I did love the idea of Rawhide.  Lots of photo ops in front of covered wagons as you approach the entrance, \"rollin', rollin', rollin\" Rawhide song blaring over the intercom, and men dressed as cowboys, greeting you with \"Howdy, Partner\".  AWESOME.  I can imagine during the Phoenix vacation season (would that be winter?), this place is equivalent to a small western Disneyland.  Unfortunately, the night we went, it was more of a ghost town.  Besides our group of 50, there was hardly any other patrons.  We headed straight for a building reserved just for us and promptly got our dinner served.

Our BBQ dinner was better than average.  A quarter chicken (mine was a bit dry), a small piece of steak (delicious), baked beans, corn on the cob, and Texas toast (cold).  A small side salad would have been a nice addition to the meal, but it was plenty of food nonetheless.  We went to the margarita kiosk and got a surprisingly strong cup for $6.  A few of us got the margarita in a boot for $8.  During the speeches and music after dinner, we noticed the wind started picking up outside.  A lot.  The place is all dirt, so it produced a mini dust storm.  Wild.  Then the lighting and rain started.  No one told me that July was monsoon weather in Arizona.  As we were making our way through mud to the parking lot, one of the cowboy staff said, \"Yup, the town's shuttin' down.  There's a storm brewin'.\"  So we missed out on all the \"attractions\", including the gun show, which sounded like a lot of cheesy fun.  The only thing I got to see was an \"arrest\" of another tourist.  You can pay $10 to have someone \"arrested\" by the sheriff and put in jail.  They made the poor guy run around with a stick horse between his legs.  I thought it was pretty funny."}
{"text":"Rawhide was reopened on 3/22 for a Welcome Reception & Dinner for the 2018 Spectrum Superstars event. Upon arrival via shuttle bus from the Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass, we were immediately greeted by employees in Country Western attire which was the theme for that night's festivities. Live entertainment from Loop Rawlins, the lariat/trick rope artist and best known as the \"One Man Wild West Show\", was so amazing. He really captivated and engaged the audience with his spectacular performance.

The western-inspired buffet was surprisingly pretty good and the caterers made sure to refresh items that were low in quantity. I especially loved the campfires that were scattered around the venue where you could relax fireside in wooden rocking chairs complete with a DIY s'more station. There was an open bar, but those \"pink\" alcoholic drinks the servers were passing around were a hit for the ladies in our party and got us lit.

Each guest had a choice of a free Stetson or Resistol cowboy hat to complete our Western outfit. We were also given $40 in vouchers to spend at any gift shop or restaurant inside Rawhide. The only con was that the lines were so long everywhere that we just gave ours away since we were tired from our trip and didn't have the patience to wait.

Overall, my husband and I really enjoyed ourselves. Thanks Spectrum and Rawhide!"}
{"text":"We took our of town family to see Rawhide and had reservations to eat at the steakhouse at 7:30.  By 9:30, we had only received our original drink order and appetizers. After asking several times when we would receive our dinner and being told over a half hour or so that it would be in five minutes, we got up and walked out.  First time in my life I have ever walked out of a restaurant.  We were so starved, we stopped at Arby's.  Our plans to look at Christmas lights after dinner were scrapped since it was so late.  Last time I will ever take anyone there."}
{"text":"I have to break this review down into 3 sections to do it right: Farmer's Market, the Wild West Town and the Steakhouse.

We started out with the Farmer's Market - a great collection of vendors, some amazing fresh veggies (mmmm, green tomatoes!) and fry bread!  The best deal in town for a huge breakfast! Steak, home fries, eggs and Texas toast for only $5.00!  You can't beat that with a stick, but a fork will do just fine.  That breakfast stayed with us all day.  The only thing they really need is more shade - we ended up eating inside the bar, because there is NO shade at the outdoor seating area.  Fine at night, but this time of year, a little too uncomfortable.

We were so impressed, we decided to come back for dinner when the \"town\" opened up. I'm not sure if it's because it's off season, but the town itself was not that impressive.  Yes, the buildings are cool, and they did a great job setting everything up.  It was just....well...boring.  The moved all the action into the \"stage\" area, and there were very few people in costume walking the streets and interacting with the guests.  It felt more like a ghost town then a wild west town.  

Of course, this wasn't the reason we came back, which leads me to the third and final part of my review, the steak house.

We were seated right away, and a pretty decent C&W live band was playing, with lots of classics by Roger Miller, Johnny Cash and other classics.

The servers were friendly and helpful, and we took our time deciding what to eat.  We all decided to try the Rawhide Amber - a nice, well balanced beer.  We also started with the fried onion strings and fried green tomatoes (couldn't wait to cook ours up.)  The onion strings were great, and as a starter, the basket was plenty for 5 people to share.  The fried green tomatoes were good, the feta on top really tasted great, but the breading wasn't the best I've ever had.  They also brought out little cornbread muffins, the best I've had that my mom didn't make, and a jar of delicious bread and butter pickles.  Honestly, I probably could have walked away satisfied after just the starters!

Side note:  We didn't bother with the rattlesnake, as we are all natives, and have had it before!

On to the main course, the three ladies ordered the Fillet Mignon, and the guys ordered one of the Sonoran Chicken specials and the Yellow Bellied Cowboy.  Sadly, I can't tell you how the Sonoran chicken was, as about 5 minutes before they served us, the waitress came to tell us that they were out.  We were left to wonder how long it takes to figure out you are out of something.  It turned out just fine, as they took the whole order off the check, but still brought my grandfather his side items, and we all shared with him.   It's not like we were running low on food...  The fillet was one of the best I've ever had, juicy and flavorful, cooked to perfection.  On a lovey bed of mashed potatoes that became infused with the juices of the fillet.

My mouth kept saying eat! Eat! but my stomach screamed for mercy, so I had to request a box.  We couldn't even think of dessert, but it sounded amazing from the descriptions on the menu!

I'd go back for an awesome steak meal anytime, and plan on hitting up the market frequently, but I wouldn't build the town up to out of town guests.  It's fun, as long as you aren't expecting too much, save that for Old Tucson."}
{"text":"Came here for Easter! Would definitely do it again! It was warm but they did a nice Easter egg hunt for the kids and served up one of the best Easter Lunches I've ever experienced! From prime rib to baked potato bar, salad bar, ham, chops, they had it all! And it's all you can eat which I am not a buffet girl but man I would come here every year with my kids! They also had a live country band it was just all around fun! Would recommend to anyone with family and kids or just couples! Fun!! Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"I was able to have a very good gluten-free meal (filet, salad with dressing, mashed potatos and corn salad) with minimal explaining (turns out I was the second diner that evening with the same server). 

The dining area is noisy, but the house band plays great country music.

Otherwise, although it was a slow night, the amusement park was very enjoyable.  Likely a good bet with kids or with older adults (my dad had a blast)."}
{"text":"Rawhide used to be a great place and tradition to visit in October to celebrate all the October birthdays in our family. The food and music was good and a walk in  the town was fun, especially this time of year.
The menu has changed and my favorite (flat iron steak) is no longer available. They give boring  dinner rolls with dinner now instead of the yummy corn bread. My husband thinks the new menu is better. I disagree. 
During this visit we hadn't even had a chance to order our drinks before the pedaling magician was at our table doing tricks for tips. The kids enjoyed the tricks, but we would have appreciated if he let us get settled in first.
Now they charge $5 to park in their empty lot and the town is no longer decorated for Halloween, no more headless horseman or coffins. They don't even do the haunted  train ride anymore. The food is mediocre and the town is boring and expensive.  It is easy to see why Rawhide is now a ghost town."}
{"text":"The food was just okay- not spectacular at all.  However, the apple pie was delicious!  The little town was lots of fun and our daughter got an adorable personalized horseshoe.  The boat ride back to the resort was so convenient and fun as well."}
{"text":"THE WORST \"2015 4th of July Event Ever\". Tried to get a refund the next day after I bought my tickets to see the Kumbia Kings & firework show and they never emailed or called me back so I ended up going. The firework show & concert sucked. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This was our first stop in Arizona. It's touristy and silly but we still had fun. No fee to get in but many of the best things cost money. We skipped the wrist band (which gives you unlimited access to the attractions) and just purchased two attraction tickets so we could see the gun show. In the meantime there was plenty to occupy us that was free.

We looked around the museum, checked out some of the cool gift shops (my favorite was probably the blacksmith shop) and ate some delicious fudge. The five dollars per person for the attraction ticket was totally worth it for a twenty minute show. We got our seats early and were entertained by one of the actors. After setting the scene they were off. It was an enjoyable (if not totally cheesy) time. 

For the young ones there is rock wall climbing, burro rides, gold panning and a petting zoo. (Who am I kidding!? I LOVE petting zoos!!) While Rawhide is definitely geared more toward children it was still a good way to blow an hour or two. I probably wouldn't go back just by myself but if I had a kid in tow and wasn't on a strict budget I would enjoy this cowboy(girl) town like no other."}
{"text":"4th of July - BIG YES!  New Tradition!

Entrance fee $10 per person for full access to the grounds, including petting zoo which kept my kids happy for 30 minutes. Probably other stuff too but  I didn't check.

Casual atmosphere, fun for kids to run and play and be loud and nobody cares. They had a store set up for clearance items $1 - $5 keeps the Tourists happy!

Fireworks were 100% in the air this year so ANYWHERE was a good spot to view!  Reasonably priced beer ($3 domestic) and beverages.  Free parking. 

You can pay upscale prices at the sit-down restaurant or drop around 8 a plate at the other locations.  EIther way, support a good recreational site, don't be stingy, its expensive to keep up these places with staff and facilities."}
{"text":"HAUNTED HOUSE THEME REVIEW

There are several other reviews on this so I'm going to stick to the Halloween themed stuff ... I looked all over yelp for these but came up short. So whatever I find I'll write about. 

Obviously it's a set tourist attraction but fun. The whole street had scary characters roaming around - Headless horseman on a horse, etc. MH was lassoed while I was in the restroom - damn I missed it! and despite my pleas he refused to get lassoed again. The horseman actually sent the teenage girls back into the restroom screaming.

The train and truck rides were ok - more kid friendly and not scary. The haunted houses (Asylum & Crypt) were pretty cool. Lots of shower curtains. Lighting a bit disorienting but that's to be expected. Just in case anyone wants to be prepared.

What impressed me a lot was how enthuasiastic the players were - so many places you go the characters seem bored and not into it, but here they seemed friendly and like they really enjoyed what they were doing. Wait, I feel a \"Priceless\" commercial coming on but you can fill it in ... Admission Cost $24. Misc Food & Beer $12 Enjoying enthuastic performers ... you fill in the blank - 

Expensive - $24 for everything - in retrospect I would have just paid for both haunted houses. Which you were only allowed in once with paid admission, unlike the other stuff which you could ride endlessly.  

Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I took my Euro visitors here.
I got them arrested
I made them ride the bull

We went to the restaurant and I made them eat rattlesnake

FYI- The restaurant was excellent, had very tasty food, and awesome management and servers

So while I wouldn't come back here just any random day... next time I have visitors that want some cheesy souvenirs and rattlesnake... here I come Rawwwwwwwwwwhideeeee!"}
{"text":"Went to the Taco & Tequila festival on 1st of October. Arrived and sign in staff was very friendly. They were still setting up the venue when we arrived. Comes to find out that there were only 2 whole booths out of the whole venue that were giving tequila and it was the very cheap disgusting tasting tequila. The tacos were sold out of a small hut and the employee's did not speak English. Taco's were 1 for $3 or 2 for $5....they were disgusting and when they made my husband's wrong they didn't understand us when we tried to ask them to fix it. For our group at $32 a head this venue did not give quality at any time of the visit... It's a cash only venue unless at a shop, happy to point you to a huge fee based ATM... Made no attempt to provide shade or seating areas out of the sun for public and of course gauged all their prices."}
{"text":"The coolest make believe Wild Western town in Phoenix.  Is it the only one in Phoenix?  Anyway, my son is always in awe of the shoot outs in the middle of the town.  Santa was even there during holiday months!  What more can he ask for?  The steakhouse has his favorite barbecue chicken with a side of fries. Live Country Western band play old tunes you can dance to.  They do have a KID'S MENU.   The town has a Pony ride, petting zoo, train, Old Western Photo and a mechanical bull!  Check out their website for events.  Just plain fun for little cowboys and cowgirls."}
{"text":"Never been, but have always been secretly lured by the neon lights and the little ball of activity that is Wild Horse Pass.  Out of towners are here for Christmas and I figured this will be our little local flavor for this visit.  Yes the prices in the steakhouse is pricey - BUT, they will split the plate for an additional $5 no problemo.  We had the City Slicker NY Strip medium rare and it was pretty darned tasty; I didn't eat myself into oblivion--thank Heavens!  Guests followed suit with the T-Bone.  We scanned through the cute little stores and the different attractions.  All of the attendants were very cordial :)

I'm a little interested in visiting in the spring when it's a little warmer."}
{"text":"This is where you go when you want to pretend you're a real life cowboy.

The funniest part of this place is the plaque on one of the cannons actually used in the movie \"Wild Wild West\" and that they're proud of it... authenticity be damned, this cannon was used in a movie that involved the Wild West and a giant, robotic spider."}
{"text":"Well, you would think that I would learn my lesson.  I should NOT be doing anything before reading the reviews on Yelp first!  

We had friends in from out of town over the holidays, and we thought we'd take them to see some of the \"old west\" and have some fun.  

Sadly, it ended up being pretty lame to be brutally honest.  We did have some fun having our husbands arrested, and they had some fun drinking a whiskey at the saloon, but other than that, Rawhide is definitely meant for kids.  EXCEPT for the super strong margaritas at the Margarita Bar.  ;)

Unless you're taking kids, skip Rawhide and take your out of towners to Goldfield Ghost Town in AJ instead."}
{"text":"Food and service was underwhelming! Went for mother's day and the buffet was disappointing: Steak, chicken and potatoes both mashed and sliced were good. My biscuits would have bounced off the floor they were so hard and the waitress failed to ever bring me my A1 sauce, had to fetch it from another table ourselves. Plus, Pepsi products= bleh and 18% gratuity at a buffet when a plate is $22 per person?!"}
{"text":"Farmers Market on Saturday mornings! I've been twice to the  market supported by local farms, butcher and artists. Loved it. Where else do they have live music and delicious steak and eggs or roasted vegetable omelet topped with goat cheese for $5?  I found gorgeous fresh fruit and vegetables dirt cheap!  If you go don't miss the Pink Lady apples from a Wilcox orchard. 
9-12 a.m. Every Saturday."}
{"text":"It was so fun!  We went there Saturday night and we're in Phoenix for 1 more day...can I tell you?  I'm tempted to go again!  I say get the $15 pass that you can use throughout the day.  The gun show and mechanical bull were both memorable.  We didn't go on the mechanical bull but we imagined we did...through the people who were courageous enough to do so!  The stores...awesome (if I weren't tired, I'd write more about what's there...but seriously, there's so much stuff there)!

We also had dinner over there...LOVED IT! 1 1/2 lb porterhouse $28.  Rattlesnake $16...it's breaded and about a foot long.  When you eat it, if you didn't know it was rattlesnake, you'd think it's chewy chicken w/lots of small bones in it.  They even give you a certificate after you eat it.   we didn't eat it though!

All I can say is that coming w/a 5 year old...this place was so fun!  They even had a band play throughout the evening.  Some people got up to dance."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!
Got to ride the stage coach, the train and enjoy a great gunfight/stunt show.
Food was great, and the Roughriders were the best.
Super friendly and all the kids seemed to like it.
Definitely a must do if you have time in the Phoenix area. Get the park pass for $15."}
{"text":"This is for the Zombie Warz Halloween attraction at Rawhide...or at least it was advertised at Rawhide. First, the Rawhide website advertised zombie wars being here but it was in an area with totally desperate parking and no one seemed to know this at Rawhide. When we got to Zombie Wars it was okay. The guides were a bit overly aggressive (think boot camp) and loud. In addition, the zombies were so far away, the paintballs didn't even reach them. Once was enough for this attraction."}
{"text":"Worst concert experience of my life! The artist was great, but no artist in their right mind who cares about their fans would ever decide to play here. It took us over an hour to get out of the \"parking lot\" (aka: dirt field) and onto the main highway (which, mind you...had I walked it--would have taken the same amount of time. No exaggerating here. Map it!) Saying Rawhide needs to work on their parking and traffic control logistics (not to mention- provide more police to help with this task) is a god damn understatement! I will NEVER see a concert at Rawhide again. Yes, it was that bad."}
{"text":"Well I remember the 'old' Rawhide in North Scottsdale and apparently, the good reviews are from people who have nothing to compare it to. I Went to this one for the first time a couple of weeks ago and was not impressed. Not sure if I missed something, never saw the mule and you would think there would be more employees in character walking around for the kids, we didnt see anything but vendors and some bored visitors walking around. Seems vendors selling stuff is the big attraction and there seems to be very little for kids to do. There was a small shooting gallery and no coin dispensers anywhere so we had to go to one of the stores and ask for change so the kids could shoot. Seems the shooting gallery needed to be re-calibrated and some more needs to be invested in some of the activities like that. Candy store didn't seem to have much, and the gun shows cost extra and those were minimally entertaining. Would be nice if more artifacts were on exhibit also. Sorry to be a buzzkill but when someone told me that this 'new' Rawhide was a disappointment I know exactly what they meant."}
{"text":"I was here for a conference event, and I think the whole thing was rented out for us. We had a buffet with a couple different things, and I thought the tri-tip was really good, along with the sides.

I bought a couple things from the gift shop, and thought the \"town\" was cute to walk through, but it was quite a bit on the cheesy side. I think they could do better trying to come across a little more authentic.

Watched one of the \"shows\" in the theater, and the young, over-the-top type of little-child humor was funny, even for all of us being adults.

I don't know how much business they get during the week (seems like the place might be a little too big for I imagine not a WHOLE lot of business), but it was fun.

If I were a three-year-old child obsessed with cowboys and Indians, this would be my favorite spot in the world. For adults without kids, though, it's campy and would be a place to visit once and that's it."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill since relocating from Scottsdale. The food is over priced and poor quality. Spend your money and time some place else."}
{"text":"We love the Rawhide Steakhouse! This venue is perfect for all types of family gatherings. My extended family and I took our moms here for an early Mother's Day dinner and needless to say, the moms were wowed. Everything about this place is phenomenal. We tried the Rattlesnake and the Rocky Mountain Oysters for appetizers and we each had an entree. The steaks were cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Service from beginning to end was impeccable, our server (I think her name was Whitney), was knowledgeable and helpful when making our selections. The Rawhide Pale Ale is definitely worth trying! 

Aside from the courteous service we received in the restaurant, I cannot believe how spot-on the band was. The main singer sang All My Ex's Live in Texas almost better than George Strait himself. They played all of our recommendations (Kaw-liga and other Hank Williams hits), and I would return to the Steakhouse again just to see this band. 

Overall, it was such a wonderfully pleasant experience I cannot wait to take my out-of-town visitors here. I highly recommend the Rawhide Steakhouse to any one looking for an unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get FAT and POOR. 

I came here for the first time in about 15 years because my mom said we could get in for free. They have actual sets from movies like Wild Wild West and the Rifleman. Good photo ops. 

However, I'm not sure anybody would want to pay to get in unless you're Canadian or from back East. There's not a lot to do. By waiting an hour for a stagecoach ride I missed the gunfight. It wouldn't happen again for two hours. They have burro rides. Ugh. A children's rock climbing wall that only goes 40 feet high. Whatever. 

The whole town is basically shops and restaurants. You can pay big bucks for a straw hat (yeahh!), for western toys like trains or you can go to a restaurant and pay $20 for a steak and potatoes (yee ha!) If you want ice cream, it's at least $3 and the person that takes your order barely speaks English. A burger is $6. I don't know what the admission price is for the \"privilege\" of going here."}
{"text":"We decided it would be fun to check this out.  Make a day of it.  I won't spend any time on the \"town\".  Suffice to say it was disappointing.  Little kids might like it.  When they say \"admission to the town is free\" it's not really true.  Yes, you can walk down the street for free, but if you want any of the attractions they will charge you.  Be warned.

On to the steak house.

The ambiance is not bad.  Very rustic.  There was no band when we were there, but they do have a stage for one.  Not sure that would help.  

They have no bread service.  So after you order you have nothing to munch while you wait.  And you will wait.  They weren't very busy but we waited.  You would think they must be cooking it fresh, right?  Well...read on...

When the food came it looked like typical fare for a steak house.  The steak was a bit tough, but pretty good.  Not $21 good (yes, it was $21), but pretty good.  They appear to use real fire (which is a plus!).  But for $21 I expect a LOT more.  Frankly, Black Angus or Outback are just as good (or better) for less.  The fries were lukewarm.  Definitely not fresh from the oil.  And now comes the puzzle.  The chicken was cooked through, but still cold.  Not COLD, but not even really lukewarm.  Did they really cook this fresh?  I don't see how or it would have been HOT.  I suspect it was reheated.  And before you think maybe it was a fluke, the neighboring table had cold chili.  Yes, that's right.  Of the half dozen or so occupied tables at least TWO of them had cold meals.  Something is fishy here.

They did take the chicken (and the chili at the next table) back and replace it.  But I don't buy that it was a fluke.  I think they are reheating old food.  And doing a poor job of it.

If you want this sort of food (steak, chicken, etc), there are a lot of places you can go that will do it better for cheaper.  This place is all hype, but they don't perform.  We won't be going back.  They get one star because the steak was pretty good, and because YELP doesn't allow zero stars."}
{"text":"The whole family LOVED this-- grandparents, parents and kids (3 &6 yr olds) a like.  Not only was the place awesome but the people/staff were, too-- and that is what really makes the place.  The blacksmith, the sheriff and the Arizona Rough Riders were our favorite people/places. 

My only suggestions would be to 1) improve the old-time photo shop. I really wanted to do the old-time photos but that shop lacked information and timeliness. By that I mean that it took the staff over 10 minutes to approach us at all (to say hi or anything), and when they finally did we were told it would be another 10+ minutes before we could be helped... we finally decided we didn't want to waste any more precious time there.  They were nice enough but lacked motivation in getting us to purchase at $30+ photo. And 2) make it more apparent where in the town to get attraction tickets.

There was so much to do in the town, though, that we weren't without other options.  In fact, we didn't get everything done that we wanted to!  We ended up eating at the hamburger/hotdog \"stand\" (which was great)-- can't wait to try the steakhouse next time! The kids are already asking to go back."}
{"text":"We had a WONDERFUL a lunch at the Rawhide steakhouse Sunday!  Staff was friendly and welcoming.  The food and as delicious.

The reason for only 3 stars, you ask??

The WHOLE reason we paid $5 to park our car in the nearly empty lot?  Our college daughter was home and we were all healthy and available to take a family photo at the Old Fashioned Photo place where you all dress up in period clothing...

We walked in, ready to take our family photo and we were the ONLY ones in the shop! Streets had maybe 3 other people wandering around. BUT no one in the photo shop except us, Santa Claus, and at least 2 employees standing there.  We asked to be photographed.  They say they were only doing Santa photos, not historical photos.  Of course we could see all the period clothing hanging right there on the wall...Again, NO other customers anywhere...

They said they only did period photos by appointment.  Could we get an appointment, we asked?  No.  No appointments available today.  Hello...???

No \"I'm so sorry Ma'am.\", no \"Very sorry for the inconvenience...\" We had planned to have these photos as presents for the grandparents this year.  I'm sure would have spent a good amount of money in that shop if ONLY they had accommodated us. NOTHING!!! Customer service completely lacking!!!

No where on the website does it mention that the photo shop had any change in the type of photos taken!  I checked before getting the family dressed and out the door.  Getting my 17 yr old son and my 20 yr old daughter motivated, showered, dressed and out the door for a photo is hard enough without getting there and having a complete let down waste of time.

To say I am disappointed is an understatement!  The 3 stars are NOT for the photo people, they only belong to the staff of the steakhouse for good service and for the nice girl in the candy shop.

I will find another place for our photos and I will be sure to let everyone else know about my experience."}
{"text":"We had a large event dinner and show here and it turned out good.  The food was okay.  They had a line for BBQ chicken and beef.  I wished I had stayed in line for for the beef, but it was just too long so i switched.  A very big piece of chicken that was okay.  The sides were good.  The show was great."}
{"text":"Wish I didn't even  have to leave one star. As someone else said, that's generous.

My family used to go to the old Rawhide with all our out-of-town family, and it used to be great! They were fun and friendly, and it was a great time.

This year, we took our little one for the Easter fun, and what a DISAPPOINTMENT!! Every single staff member, except for one girl in the Blacksmith shop, was incredibly unfriendly and rude! The girl walking the burros didn't seem to like animals or kids, and was very rude and unfriendly. The petting zoo, and panning for gold people were just as bad. I understood that it was a hot day, but this is your JOB and people pay to have fun at this place.....so unprofessional and maddening to see such unfriendly people working with the public!!

The prices wouldn't have been too high if the people had been friendly, and made it an enjoyable experience, but we couldn't get away from there fast enough!! 

I just used to love going as a kid, and the cowboys and cowgirls were so friendly, and made it fun. These people today were truly awful!!

We WILL NOT be going back anytime soon...and based on these reviews I'm sure glad we didn't get the food....which also used to be wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Howdy Cowpokes!

Western themed town just outside of south Phoenix and chandler Arizona...

We saw the six gun show and the Arizona Rough Riders made an entertaining show. 

Cool live music and friendly entertaining staff do their best to amuse you. 

Our little blonde waitress Melanie was friendly and nice. 

We got a monster sized bowl of steakhouse chili for $7 that was huge and good!

Good T-Bone steaks and sweet potato fries with some sweeeet ice as tea.

Stop in for a good night..."}
{"text":"What a disappointment 

I can here for an event and payed online before coming

They didn't have it on the site that they charge for parking. Cash only. Not mentioned on the website. 

I get in get my tickets and find out that if I want to buy more its cash only (if you guessed that good job). 

So after having to drive back to Chandler and find an atm. When I got inside I had to use the restroom and was told by one of the employees that there are no Port a potty's inside and that I would have to walk to the other side of the park to use the restroom. 

Typing this outside the restroom. Can't wait to see what else will happen."}
{"text":"i took my dad here because he loves western stuff and i thought we could see one of the shows they do there. 

it was free to get in, but parking is 5 bucks. there weren't many people on a sunday so we were able to meander in and out in about an hour and a half. we did watch one wild west show and it was well done. very comical, 4 bucks per person. they do several throughout the day. 

the town is mostly tourist shops with stuff for sale. there's a steak house on site, and lots of large group areas for corporate events. a small museum is on premise and was the most interesting part of the place. 

good for families with kids too."}
{"text":"Raw Hide western town is reminiscent of all the cool places you went to as a kid with your parents-  not 6 flags or anything-not quite a county fair.  If your kids are ages 2-10 (and a very kid like 10) perfect; have fun for pretty cheap price.  If your kids are more mature then it will be lacking. Most of the \"rides\" are designed for preschool to elementary age. The few that are for a 48\" kid is 2 types of mechanical bull ride and a small rock climbing wall.  The gun fights and western shows are quite childish, albeit rather funny for those juveniles in the crowd.  Overall for parents with a young family go for it - and there is beer and wine so my favorite was the saloon."}
{"text":"If you want a fun, wild west experience, Rawhide is the place!!  Workers are in costume and in character, perfect combination of cheesy and charming, and a fun place to bring the kids!  The food is great too!  Just make sure you are on good behavior or the sheriff might just throw you in jail!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Thursday Evening in April for dinner and some entertainment.  I think it was a great time to go because there weren't too many tourists there, except for us.  :)    I think most of the people there were locals. 

First, we ate at the Steakhouse.  I would definitely recomment the BBQ ribs.  They were finger-lickin' good.  My husband had the T-bone, which he liked.  While we ate dinner, we listened to the tunes of a live band.  I loved when they played me some Johnny Cash.    

We walked around.  The attractions are great for a younger age group (under 16).  We had a nice time walking around, taking pictures and all."}
{"text":"A new tradition starts this year ! Santa at Rawhide ! The family had a great time with a tree lighting ceremony and a visit from Santa. The kids loved Santa ( real beard included), sat in his lap and we got a nice Polaroid to boot. Definitely better that any Department Store wanna be. Rawhide did a great job. Looking forward to next year."}
{"text":"My 5 kids loved this place.  They rode the mechanical bull over and over again.   We arrested their grandmother and they got a kick out of that.  Some of the things weren't open.  They loved the rock climb.  Theres a weight restriction on the Burro rides which is under 90#.  The gunfights were great and fun.  It was a cool town."}
{"text":"Rawhide Event Center was terrible! Attended a concert there last night (6/19/18). Getting off the interstate was a nightmare, zero traffic control. Took more than an hour from the exit of interstate to parking lot. Parking was $10 for a dirt filled lot, security lines were insane as guys and girls were separated though many electronic tickets were together and people got lost from each other, the \"red barn\" was insane where you first entered. The drink lines for alcohol called for a wrist band which we weren't told till we got to the counter to order in which we had to go get in another line for the wrist band. It was a circus, pure circus! I will never again attend a concert or any other event there again!"}
{"text":"We had so much fun at Rawhide. We just went from store to store, had some things made at the blacksmiths, bought a cowboy hat and some jewelry, Had a wonderful dinner at the steakhouse, I recommend the prickly pear margarita and the house merlot. Food was excellent! We also did old west pictures and that was fun! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Was staying at a resort just a boat ride away, so thought we'd check out Rawhide on our last night. We enjoyed the live action show put on by the Arizona Roughriders - what a fun, talented group of stuntmen/women and actors! Aside from that, the experience was pretty much what I expected it to be. Probably the most fun for kids ages 5 and under. Not including any insight here in regards to steakhouse (will review seperately.) I have; however, removed 1 entire star from this review for one lonely mini horse I saw in the petting zoo, who has so obviously foundered, with very long, unshorn hooves. They may be treating it, but it looked so uncomfortable, with no relief in sight for him. I hope when he isn't on display, he has some soft straw he can rest on, as his feet looked to be in quite a bit of pain."}
{"text":"Everything is great here, the atmosphere, the service and most certainly, the food. Even though my food was delivered 30 minutes after everybody else, my food was amazing. The steak had great flavor. I did come with a party of about 20 people so I can understand why this might of happened. I would really recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went for the Sangria Festival.  The lines were a thirty to forty minute wait for one tasting.  You would not be able to taste all the different Sangrias due to the line length. The majority of the time you just spent standing in ridiculously long lines.  Complete rip off.  I do not recommend this event."}
{"text":"Went there last weekend and loved it. I use to go to this place as a kid and I still loved it as an adult. I have three kids ages from 5-17 and they all loved it. I took them for the experience and they absolutely loved it here. Not a crowded place at all. We did pay $5 for parking but that is not bad at all. We splurged and bought the wrist bands for each of us which was for unlimited activities and shows and we made sure we got the most out of it. We went to every show and did every activity multiple times. The kids loved running around and interacting with everyone. We did not eat at the steakhouse which I wish we would have but we still had a great time."}
{"text":"For those who like the kitchy type experience, this is a place for you. We were allowed access on a rental basis for a conference that we were attending. This is an old west town where you still have the wood sidewalks and the dirt right down the middle of town. Places to eat and places to spend your money, this is a good place to spend your time and money."}
{"text":"We had went to rawhide Aug 30 and to celebrate my 10 year anniversary and to try the rattlesnake. First of all it started ok until the new waiter spilled water all over my Dad's back. I understand he was training but the only comp we got from them was \"oh sorry he was a trainer\" and we got 2 baskets of  cornbread. What kind of comp  is that?  They did not even offer to get his clothes dry cleaned or even dried off. 
Next the food ... Rattlesnake was no different from popcorn chicken. It was not what I expected. The steak and prime rib was dry and the sides were not good. And I got sick the next day with diarrhea and vomiting. 
I  spent a lot of money and was disappointed with the entertainment. Overall my experience was 1 one star. Not a happy customer"}
{"text":"This place is cool in a cheesy, fun way. 

Cowboys, shoot outs and your drunken uncle are all roaming around. Not kidding there's a guy pretending to be a drunk cowboy. He's great comic relief. 

The shoot outs are pretty regular and entertaining. Heck if you're standing close enough  they will probably use you as an extra. 

I think I ate half a cow for dinner. The beef ribs were tender and seasoned perfectly. The tri tip was delicious! I could cut it with a butter knife. I also tried their baked beans which were ok. Beans are just a filler anyway. Back to the meat. The BBQ chicken required a bib-just the way I like it. Don't tell my grandfather but their BBQ sauce was better than his! 

The comedy show featuring Wild Bill was cheesy. I'm sure my little nephew would've done a better job jumping off the roof in a death fall. I didn't expect Michael Bay special effects so the show met my expectations. 

Overall fun for the whole family."}
{"text":"We spent 6 hours here 01/03/15 and it was amazing ! We brought 3 children under the age of 10 and they loved it. In order to get your monies worth you need to purchase the activity bracelet for $15 per person. The bracelet allows you into all the shows (there are apx 8 ) and you can do all activities as many times as you want . (There are apx 8 activities) . The kids favorite was panning for gold . I highly recommend staying until dark because it's lite up beautifully. We ate dinner at the steakhouse which was overpriced and just ok. I figured I was paying for the atmosphere . The best part was that this trip
Inspired a curiosity in the old west, and in Doc Holliday for the kids"}
{"text":"Alright so this particular night and experience was a complete joke. I have been to Rawhide a bunch of times and have been coming to this venue for at least a decade. They had a special Holiday Beer and Wine Festival there this weekend. Purchased the tickets ahead of time, read all the fine print. Get to venue and $5 to park. Dont accept debit card or credit card for parking only cash (no signs about that anywhere and the event website mentioned nothing about additional cost for parking). So i ask what do you advise we do. He says, \"drive down to the chevron and there is an atm\". So go to the Chevron and NO atm. Long story short, i have never one time at Rawhide paid for parking. ..it has always been free. If you are going to advertise a special event then make sure to advise parking is extra because people who have come to this venue before would assume its free and people who have never been either 1. Dont carry cash and 2. Making me people drive to the chevron who dont know the area or are from out of town and just visiting to a place with no atm...very frustrating and a huge waste of time!"}
{"text":"Under whelming, really nothing to do here. The main attraction was a rock climbing wall and a donkey ride that went about 100 feet total. I would skip this and spend my money in the Casino. We took our seven year old and she was ready to leave after twenty minutes. Forgot they have a mechanical bull"}
{"text":"Cowboy up people, this place is all about the old west. Gun fights in the streets, horse rides, jails for the spouse, its got something for everyone. I told my kids there and they had a ball. My son loved it with his boots and hat and cowboy gun. Its a excellent place to go for the whole family. Yee Haw."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for the kids. Its' cozy size (there really is just the Main street) and overall look worked wonders for the kids, they felt they were transported to the Wild West. they loved seeing the \"real\" cowboys.

In the evening it's perfect because it's cooler and they light campfires at both ends of the main street. For a $15 dollar pass (a bracelet) you can do unlimited activites. Do three activities and it's paid for. We did the train ride, rock wall, gold panning, gun fight show, burro ride and mechanical bull.

this place is probably better suited for younger kids, there might not be enough to interest teens.

This place is a little rough around the edges but what old tymey western town isn't? Go for a casual slow paced night out with the family."}
{"text":"It was my first visit here. To my surprise a great place to hang with the old western gunslingers. Nevertheless they told me the girl who was with me was way better looking than the one I brought last week ;) Twice!
Zip line , souvenir shops, jail, cowboy shows a complete western town, BBQ and steakhouse and much more, I thought I was in a John Wayne movie. Real cool experience. Thank you Karen :)"}
{"text":"Fun place for kids n fam. Food is amazing n constant walking cowboys challenging u to a gun fight.. Gotta feel the old western town . yall must come out, it is pretty cooo."}
{"text":"Yummy Thanksgiving dinner; all you can eat; walk-in. It was delicious and nice weather to eat on patio. Something for everyone--prime rib(carved), pork tenderloin, turkey, steak, and more. Lots of sides and soup/salad bar. Dessert too!"}
{"text":"The place is a little bit campy but great for first timers to the Phoenix area. Food seemed a bit pricey but the \"town\" ambiance makes up for the increase in price. Also the staff is super friendly and helpful, even when it was over 100 degrees with annoying kids running around and the staff dressed in full leather. Especially the town sheriff, glad to know there are good people still out there."}
{"text":"I would have never chosen to go here but my buddy made me go! 
He was looking for an old Western Town and his parents went here years ago.  I hated to tell him that there was no mechanical bull back in 1888. 

When we got here there were families celebrating birthdays with kids and large groups of people coming in on tourist buses. It was kind of like a tourist trap. 

The musical act on stage was uninspired...seemed like they were just playing their music set, taking long breaks and collecting there check. The food was okay...an Outback Steakhouse would have tasted better. My drink came in a cracked glass...how does a bartender not see that before they pour a drink? Answer: Someone who is bad at there job and collecting there check. 

The fun parts of the evening:  the Rattlesnake we had for dinner. It tasted like Calamari. And the actors in the old western town.  They were in character and it was funny to have conversations with them. It reminded me of that episode of South Park...when the boys went on the field trip to an old western town...I think the creators of the show might have come here for research. 

If I had kids I would go back here because it would be fun for them.  I would not go here for the food!"}
{"text":"We went to the town and had the kids arrested by the town Sheriff . It was really funny!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Great for families.  We enjoyed the large portions and live music while dining. The menu doesn't have many options, but had some good stuff to choose from.. They have a nice salad bar too. Waiter was pleasant and attentive. We enjoyed the 10 minute gun show, its free for the young bucks and $5 for adults."}
{"text":"I was fortunate to be in town during Memorial Weekend so I could check out the Farmer's Market and the $5 breakfast. FYI, the Market is closed for the summer and will re-open in October. We got there a little after 9am, but there was only a handful of vendors.  That was disappointing, but maybe we got there too early.  Since I didn't want any jewelry or honey, I went to stand in line for breakfast.  You actually pay first at the cashier line, then take your receipt to the breakfast station, so if it's crowded, you'll be standing in 2 lines.  A little annoying, but the breakfast station line moves fast.  I had the veggie frittata w/goat cheese, which came with Texas toast and potatoes.  It was ok, nothing special.  Other choices included pancakes and steak.  Not too much to do in the morning.  No mechanical bull, no activities.  The sundown hay ride and cookout might be more fun, but I was pretty disappointed. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Short one... 

Really fun, Characters are fantastic. Definitely see the gun shoot out and the old time photos are worth the kinda expensive price. good time for all ages."}
{"text":"My husband and I had so much fun at Rawhide! We stayed at the Sheraton and took the boat ride to and from Rawhide. Everything looked so authentic to the time. The food at the steakhouse was Delish and affordable. We saw the AZ Roughriders perform they are hilarious. We will definitely go back the next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is strictly about the event center and outdoor facility.
It's a very nice place for being dusty and dirty. It wouldn't be my choice for any event since they don't water the grass and with thousands of people walking around it's an unbreathable environment with all the dust and debris in the air.
If you go during a windy day take a dust mask."}
{"text":"Yep, definitely for the kids. If you want something resembling a ghost town head to Goldfield or Tombstone. 

Rawhide's full of kids' rides and shows to keep them entertained. 

Although I was impressed by this one trick-shooting show where the star challenged the audience to be able to clap before he could draw, shoot, and reholster his gun. No one was able to do it."}
{"text":"My only experience is Mother's Day Brunch, but it rocked! Probably the best BBQ buffet I've ever had. Very Vegas like! The filet medallions were probably the best meat I've ever had at a buffet. The kids loved the live country band. I just wish it was open earlier before the sun started beating down. I'd definitely go there again if passing through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here for Thanksgiving dinner. 18.95 for adults and 8.95 for kids. The adults and kids plates were exactly the same, the only difference was a small (and I do mean small) salad that the adults got. The food itself was good, not home cooking but hey you're not at home right? The steak was good as well. The service at dinner was all but not there. We had waitress who was too busy to actually answer questions and be a person, never checked on us for more than a second it was passing by so if you needed something good luck!

Atmosphere was cool. The characters that roam around and the other stuff outside the steakhouse were cool too. It was too muddy for some stuff to open since the rain storm hit a week ago and flooded the area but they made the best of it.

I would go back, but I don't think I would eat here. The prices for food like any other \"amusement\" area are crazy high but you're not far from the mall and cheaper food. Over all for no admission costs and tickets/wrist bands it was a great time. It would have been 4 or 5 stars if the service in the steak house was there."}
{"text":"This one is specific to the steakhouse. While the prices are a bit high, it is expected since it is a tourist attraction and does have the additional cost of being a \"Old West\" attraction.  That being said, they had a $10 - 10oz deal on fillet or strip steak.  The sides are not the most exciting, but the steaks here have a great flavor and mine have always come cooked to temp.  AND you get great live music (mostly country and western, but they throw in some others). I would recommend taking the kids and enjoy all Rawhide has to offer.

Note- call and make a reservation, sometimes the place is wide open, others booked to capacity (tourist buses), so planning can help make sure you get a seat."}
{"text":"Call before you get here. I am very angry. I went to the website yesterday to confirm the time the place opened. And it said noon. We get here today, only to be told that nothing opens until 2. I have for little kids who are hot and cranky with nothing to do. This would not be bad if Rawhide weren't located in the middle of nowhere and we could just leave and come back. This is totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place is fun for a couple of hours but not all day and certainly not at full price. We got unlimited wristbands on Groupon and we were really glad we did because full price would have been a rip off. We really came here for our 4 year old daughter and she thought it was fun. She liked the roller coaster and the spinning ride that they had. The pretend gunfire scared her at first so make sure you explain to your kids what to expect as there was many kids who were crying because of the loud bang. Overall, a good place to check out once but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"We ate dinner at the Steakhouse which was actually the best part of the whole town. We walked around \"town\" and looked into the shops which were unimpressive. You needed to pay for all of the attractions too. There were hardly any people around which made it kinda sad. Better place for kids than adults."}
{"text":"We had reservation at 7 pm it arrived at 6:30. Hostess was very accommodating and we only had to wait about 10 minutes. After we were seated waitress came very quickly. Our food arrived in less then 15 minutes after we ordered. Wife had prime rib daughter had tri tips and I had barbecue sampler platter. The food was very good. Only complaint was the corn on the cob was a little over cooked. Waitress was very good about refilling our drinks and asking if we needed anything else. Overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"This place was pretty much dead when I visited. The dirt road and fires were kind of cheesy to be honest but entrance was free and it's a unique environment. The gun show was the saving grace. For only $5, you get to see quite the performance and there's many different shows to see."}
{"text":"I took my family during their birthday celebration because it was free.  It was a great deal.  My kid had a blast!  She loved it and still talks about \"the cowboy hat.\"  They have a nice petting zoo with quite a few different animals.  Also, burro or mule rides (we passed on that) were available.  The town is pretty cute with a couple of different things going on to entertain you - shows, bull rides, games.  There are a couple of different shops to buy some food but we opted for the restaurant.  Food was mediocre at best and the selection was very small.  Service was only so-so.

Finding a little bar and getting a margarita and beer to walk around with was a welcomed surprise.

Bottom line, this place is pretty cool and a great place to take out-of-town family.  I am not sure that I'd spend the money on the admission then spend the money on each \"attraction.\"  I think we would have been disappointed but free is always a good price for trying new things, if they offer free admission again I'd probably go again.  I definitely wouldn't recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow it was THE strip mall carnival of the Wild West. Not my scene, but may be yours and families. Steak was decent. Margarita was possibly the worst I've ever had, sent it back for some pretty bad Chardonnay. Front staff were very sorry to see us and expressed it in as many was as she could w/o losing her job. We were apparently the last table at 8:00pm! Seriously ?!  Server was sweet and attentive. Music - lmao! The guy was pretending to play but was singing along to karaoke!"}
{"text":"We can't say anything bad about the food but the hostess wouldn't even take our name down for a table, she rolled her eyes when we asked her how long for a table, we basically had to beg her to put our name on the list, she took our name and phone number and she said she would call at 7:30, it's 8:00 and she hasn't called, we will never go back to try the food, the service stop us at the door."}
{"text":"I didn't get to see the prices, because my wife paid for everything. But the steak....the steak! THE STEAK! It was thick, succulent, packed with flavor, marbled with slivers of fat, and just.. STEAK!

I loved the folks who work here - who literally just walk around and hang out around town. They're not so in-your-face, they just blend into the background - you really feel like you've been transported back to the old days.

And the restaurant serves rattlesnake! I thought there was too much batter, but overall it was good. Tasted like popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"You know, I grew up going to the old location for Rawhide when I was a kid. We went every single time that we had company visiting. I remembered it being really great then, but as an adult... maybe it's just because I've been there so many times I just wasn't as enthralled as I was in my childhood. I do have to say that I appreciate getting a hat tip from guys when walking around, it's always a nice compliment.

My family decided to get old west photos taken while we were all together, and the set up they have in their studio here is pretty impressive. Most places that do western photos only have one back drop, this place has several. They have tons of items to choose from when dressing up. The staff is pleasant and friendly.

The shops in Rawhide were a little sparse to be honest; I was kind of surprised they didn't have more stuff in them. It is apparent to me this place is feeling the sting of the economy, especially because it is free. It is, none the less, relatively entertaining. I don't know if I would go back again if I weren't on a picture taking mission, or wanting to feel a bit of my childhood memories. It is probably best as a first time experience."}
{"text":"I came here for my husband's office Christmas party and I had a wonderful time!  The Christmas party was held in the Adobe room and as we walked in to the grounds of Rawhide we were greeted by employees dresses in period Western costumes and a roaring fire pit.  There were festive Christmas lights and decorations lining the main street of Rawhide and it was a lovely sight!

We were directed to the location of our event and we entered the old fashioned salon style building to see a huge beautiful tree in the main lobby, and old western antiques and beautiful period art everywhere.  The antiques and theme artwork really lent an old west ambiance to the place.

We were served steaks, bbq chicken, baked potatoes, beans, salad and garlic bread in a pass-thru line and it was extremely efficient, plus the food was outstanding.  You could look into the open kitchen in the back and see the employees cooking the steaks and chicken over an open pit suspended grill.  It was neat to watch.  The dining room servers were all in western costumes and were friendly and efficient at clearing plates.  There were two cash bars set up and the friendly bartenders were serving perfectly mixed cocktails in addition to beer and wine.

This party had a DJ and he did a good job of keeping the party lively and MC'ing the event.  My only complaint was that his mic wasn't turned up quite loud enough for us to hear every speech given buy the managers of my husband's company because we were sitting in the back on the banquet hall.  Aside from that I have no complaints or observations, just that I had an outstanding time!!"}
{"text":"Lots of different things to do!  The sherif was hilarious!  We had him arrest two of the guys in our group which was very fun!  Steakhouse was so good.  Summer night hayride was actually really nice."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful. Reasonable prices.  Drove 45 min on a Saturday at 1pm only to find out they had a private party and wouldn't open until 4pm. No signage indicating that they were closed. The entrance gate was justbclosed.  The website says Fri - Sun (Sat and sun open at noon),  yelp shows wed-sun 5-10. I recommend calling first and hopefully someone answers.  Frustrating."}
{"text":"I think most natives have been to the old Rawhide that was located on Scottsdale Road, but unless you've had tourists in town like I have, you probably haven't been out to the new location yet.

My cousins from Switzerland love anything that has a western theme, and where better to take them than Rawhide?!  It's the perfect place to take out of country (or town) guests that want to experience a little bit of the cowboy life, but I think it would be great for children's birthday parties, group functions and even those that just like cowboys and cookouts and all that jazz.

Rawhide itself isn't that big, but it's really cute.  They made the shops look pretty realistic (but then again, I am only assuming as to what an 1880 saloon would have looked like).  And they have staged gunfights at certain times during the day.  They also have stunt shows, a shooting gallery, petting farm, gold panning, stage coach rides, camel rides, live music and a steakhouse. 

The actors were really great with my cousins and they made the whole experience really memorable for them.  Their sundown cookout was a lot of fun too. I even had a good time and I really thought that I wouldn't.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"What a massive disappointment. When Rawhide was in Scottsdale, it was such a magical place. They painstakingly ensured that everything was true to the 1880s. Now the train is pulled by a golf cart and the stage coach is just a covered wagon pulled by a modern tractor. The animals are few and far between. What a sell-out. I never need to go back. My cherished childhood memories will stay in Scottsdale. This is a cheap tourist trap looking to make a buck."}
{"text":"A GREAT Place to take Mom, Dad, Granny, Gramps and the Kids. What fun to have this place so close and for it to be so fun. The Kids had a blast and It was great family time enjoyed by everybody. Just hated that we were charged 5 buck to park."}
{"text":"This restaurant was an experience in food and entertainment. The food was great, the mixed drinks were fresh, and the servers were attentive. The entertainment (singer/musician) was very talented and engaging with the crowd, but not over the top.  

On the way in, I stopped by to ride the bull. It was a really cool experience to set the tone. The setting is like an old western movie and very interactive. A great place for large groups or families with kids."}
{"text":"clearly RAWHIDE makes an effort to keep things family friendly -- like $2 water (which i paid $6 the day before at a baseball game). the kids had a blast climbing the rock wall (JULIANA made it nearly to the top), riding the train, the stagecoach and the burros. 

WYATT was completely fascinated by the blacksmith and watched him work for over an hour. for me the hi-lite was when the four-year old got arrested (for breaking hearts) and tossed in the RAWHIDE jail. he couldn't stop giggling. 

JULIANA panned for gold until her fingers looked like skinny, white prunes. 

i think the kids could have spent the entire day in the petting zoo with the pot-bellied pigs, the baby goats, the llama, the sheep and the chickens.

the gunfights were high drama !!  we splurged ($40) on an 8x10 sepia photograph of the TATUM clan as outlaws and saloon girls which we christened the \"HOLE-IN-THE-HEAD GANG\" ...

three days later and the kids are still wearing their hats and sherriff badges. great family fun on a shoestring budget."}
{"text":"I live and Chandler and found a gem for the kids to enjoy. we go once a month to get our \"western\" fix."}
{"text":"We have been taking our kids here for 2 years now. They love it! This is more for kids than adults. We always let them do the rides but never have had the food there. The photo shop is expensive but worth it. They give lots of attention to each photo and its super fun. The gun show is funny and the actors really work with the audience. We will be back and hopefully get to eat there."}
{"text":"I've been to Rawhide several times.  The shows are geared towards children and the restaurant is ok.

Going during the winter months was my best experience.  They light up their whole town.  

They even had a mechanical bull one time that I went.

Worth checking out for sure.  Yee Hah!"}
{"text":"We came late on a Saturday night. and had dinner at the Steakhouse. The service was fast and pleasant. The dinner salads were very good. The blue cheese was the best I have ever had and the little corn muffin was perfect.

My husband got the prime rib. It was seasoned fine, but I am of the opinion that they use lower grade beef. You just cannot roast a choice or select prime rib and have it come out so tough. The sirloin I got was tough and grisly as well. The beans and corn were prefect as were the baby back ribs. They need to work on the sauce, but the ribs were fall apart tender.

I did get to go into the shops and listen to some music. It was nice, but corny and campy like a tourist trap should be. I rather like them and Rawhide is a fun place to while away a portion of the day."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!

A friend of mine and our two kids (ages 13 and 16) dropped by this place because we were at an event right next door and had heard something about a Western Town so we decided to check it out.  It's easy enough to find and has a HUGE dirt parking lot.  I've read a lot about $5.00 parking but we didn't have to pay anything - I assume that they only charge during big events.

As soon as you walk in you are greeted by an older prospector who likes to say \"Howdy\".  You turn into the town and you see nothing but an awesome open dirt road where a gun fight should be taking place surrounded by 1880's western buildings.  I immediately felt as if I were in the 1880's and I was keeping an eye out for a lonely tumbleweed to float by or a saloon girl or an angry cowboy to start walking around in front of me. 

They have a cute little gift shops that have some trinkets that are somewhat reasonably priced.  (Since the town is so \"one of a kind\" I'd actually pay more for some of the items.  They have a mock jail with an electric chair out front and a blacksmith shop with actual fire where you can purchase custom horseshoes for your home or garden.  

At the back of this one street (and one horse) town, are some kid rides and a climbing wall.  They also have a Steak House which we did not try due to time constraints.  

I've noticed a couple of these reviews are about the Steak House which is annoying because the Steak House has its own review page - this one is supposed to be for the town only.

The best part about our little visit was watching the live show/gun fight.  I believe it was $5.00 per person to watch this 20-30 minute show and it was super fun:
This particular show was about a bounty hunter and his over the top funny friend bringing in a criminal for a reward.  It included real gun shots and roof top fights.  It gave me a giddy happy \"like a kid\" feeling.  Even the 16 year old and the 13 year old were smiling ear to ear!  I would recommend to anyone and everyone to visit this town at least once.

I think it would be super fun to open a hotel in this town and allow adults to make reservations in the Saloon so we can drink and get lost in the \"old west drunk\" feeling come night fall.  They could do this once a month or something. I'd totally pay for that."}
{"text":"This review references just the steakhouse. We really only had time for our meal here, so I'll leave the rest of Rawhide to others.

Rawhide produces a decent steak, most of the time. On this night, me and one of my friends both ordered a NY strip, medium rare, that essentially came out medium well-to-well.

Overcooking a steak is just something you don't do if you're a steakhouse. Devise a system. Time your steaks right. Do whatever you have to do not to screw that up. We were a bit pressed for time, so we didn't send them back, but they were tough, although had a bit of flavor to them.

My vote was 2 stars, but my cohorts without overcooked steaks enjoyed their meals alright. The sides are somewhat standard fare, nothing spectacular or amazing by any means, but they bake a potato as well as the next budget steakhouse.

On that note, the budget isn't terribly cheap. I think my steak was pushing $25, which is fine for a NY strip if you get it right. 

The corn on the cob was disappointing (likely frozen and then warmed/briefly grilled?) and that's something you shouldn't try to cheap out on.

For dessert, we had a lovely pot o' stearno-powered table-made smore kit, which was fun, and a good $3. 

Overall, unless you're making an old west evening of it, you can clearly get a much better steak for cheaper at some place like Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Fun to visit this old town!

Lots of ambience and things for the kids to do.

Food is mediocre,  so eat elsewhere is you're a Foodie!"}
{"text":"I went once when it was up in Scottsdale and I probably wouldn't have gone again (Old Tucson is a lot better), but there was a huge group going and I was invited to do the Sundown Cookout.  I'd never gone before, so I thought I'd give it a little try.

First off, it's $45 and if you want first dibs on a table, you have to go early.  The first wagon rolls out at 6pm.  If you're going with a big group like I did, you'll want to reserve a table for the party.

To start the party off, you get a little short hayride pulled by horses or mules.  It was a beautiful ride watching the sun set, just a little shorter than I thought it would be.  Once there, everyone gets a straw cowboy hat and red bandana.  

For food, you get your choice of steak, ribs, or chicken.  You also get a baked potato, piece of bread, and cowboy beans.  There's free lemonade, iced tea, or coffee.  After the main meal, there's apple pie and marshmallows on big long skewers that you can roast at one of the firepits.

The steak was perfectly done - extremely tender and had a good flavor.  I had the ribs and they were fall off the bone good without being too mushy.  I didn't get to try the chicken.  Everyone seemed very happy with their food.

The apple pie was pretty good.  The roasting of marshmallows was a nice touch.

I'm wavering between giving this place a 3.5 or 4 stars (I'm erring on the positive side) because it's quite expensive.  We also had to wait for a table and weren't the only ones waiting.  Beer was about $4 a bottle, soda was $2.50 a bottle.  

There was also live entertainment and a little poker section as well as a play area for kids where they would pretend to rope cattle.  The band was actually pretty good.

At one point one of the actors was shooting off his gun, and one girl that must have woken on the wrong side of the bed wrinkled her nose and said that he needed to stop that.  

Hellooo, we're supposed to be in the old west....ever see Tombstone?  Maybe if you didn't wear high heels in the desert you wouldn't be in such a bad mood.

But I digress.  In the end, we had fun and since I'd never been, it was a good experience.  I probably wouldn't do it again unless someone visiting from out of town really insisted and begged to see it.  

By the way, I know I mentioned Old Tucson...but the benefit of Rawhide is that admission is free.  You only pay for food, drink, and souveniers...and of course the Sundown Cookout."}
{"text":"Visited this place twice or three times... can't remember.  I know people find \"fake\" western towns cheesy.... I rather enjoyed it.  But then again, I go on days that there are no entrance fees.  The restaurant is average in food, but I enjoyed it.  Love walking around and watching my kids run around the dirt roads.

It's a great place for kids, IMO... and if you, as an adult, like western towns... I'd at least stop by for pics and a stroll.  But remember it's \"fake\".  

Old Town Tucson is quite nice, if you compare the two... but I would never pay as much as Old Town charges again.  One time solo is enough for this gal."}
{"text":"Rawhide is a cute little ranch on the grounds of the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass and Resort. From the resort, there is a small boat that will take you over to the entrance or you can drive to it yourself. They have a general store, saloon, jail, blacksmith, and variety of other specialty stores. They even have a simulated gun show at 9PM (must buy a ticket to see though). When I went it was pretty cold, so there were fire pits set up all around the ranch. I bet if you were to be there in the summer it would be just beautiful with the live music and picnic benches. It's a cool little place to visit if you're staying at the resort, but I'm not sure why you would go otherwise."}
{"text":"Cool place if you have family from out of town visiting but it sucks now. They charge for parking now.  Really?  Those are the little things that makes me not go back to a place. Just little details that ruin everything. I'm not cheap but as we can see they lose that attention to details and makes them look cheap and opportunistic."}
{"text":"We came here on Friday with some business associates from San Francisco that wanted a \"taste of the southwest\" so someone in the group suggested we dine at the steakhouse at Rawhide.  Not my idea, but I was just along for the ride.

We got here right as they opened and were seated immediately and a live country band was already blasting the music.  Personal reparations must have been due, because I was in my own sweet hell.  On the flip side, everyone else seemed to be enjoying the country music.  Kids were dancing and people were shouting out requests.  Our friendly waiter came over pretty quickly and took our drink orders, brought those out then took our food orders.  (HUGE bonus.  The waiter carded me, he sure knows how to work the ladies, I made sure the husband left him a big tip.  I realized though that if I did actually look 21 - I know, I'm dreaming - and the toddler just turned three, that means it appears that I had him when I was 18 and possibly even got knocked up when I was 17?  That's white-trash-tastic!)   I ordered some cut of steak and a quarter chicken to share with the toddler.  I ordered it medium rare but on the rare side (the steak, not the chicken).  Now I don't want to order it rare because they say it will come out cold in the middle so shouldn't medium rare come out just warm in the middle?  It always seems to come out more medium, just a tiny bit of pink in the middle.  Anyway, we got our iceberg lettuce salads, they were fine and some corn muffins with jalapeños the toddler horded then the entrees came out.  My steak was cooked OK.  More towards medium but not totally.  It was seasoned pretty well and the toddler liked the chicken.  It came with some thick, chunky mashed potatoes and a sweet, soft corn mixture.  I skipped both of those.  It also had a side of grilled asparagus which was nice.  I didn't expect that here.

All in all, the food is OK, the priced are high for what you get food wise but I guess you're paying for the experience.  Outside the guy giving burro rides was going to give a free one to the toddler because he thought he was a cute little girl (he has long, curly hair) but the toddler chickened out (then of course regretted it and ran after the burros) so that was nice.  Everyone was very friendly and it seems like a place children would like.  I don't think I'd come here again willingly, but there sure are a lot worse places I cold have been."}
{"text":"I had some extra time with my friend and we decided on a whim to check this place out. It is off-season so there were not a ton of people around. Had some snacks and it was like walking around an old Western town. It is fun and worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"This is the place to bring out of town visitors. It's a version of the old wild west.  You will find saloons, gift shops, restaurants, a petting zoo and lots of other unique and fun things to do. 

It is all outside so plan on wearing shoes that will get dusty and don't go on a hot day.  Otherwise, you will be sidling up to the bar, having a cerveza and riding the bull.  Which is what my group did.  Does make for some entertaining facebook posts!

Be sure to buy tickets for the \"attractions\", but if you plan on doing more than a few you are better off getting a wristband.  On the Friday evening that we visited, a lot of the stores were closed. I think because it was Cinco de Mayo and they were competing with all the Mexican bars/restaurants.

Anyhow, it's scenic, it's free to get in and it's something to do. A lot of good photo ops are here.  It's worth checking out if you are looking for something to do."}
{"text":"Reading these reviews, I find it hard to believe people go to Rawhide for adult events. Rawhide is, plain and simple, for kids. And our kids (8 and 10)  LOVED it. They rode the mechanical bull, they took the burro, stagecoach and train rides, they watched the sharpshooter and gunfight shows, and yes, we all had the not very good but not very bad steakhouse dinner together.

They asked to go back again the next day. Enough said?

If you are looking for dinner with friends, an office party, a wedding rehearsal dinner, or to get engaged, this is definitely not the place."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the first time, its a fun place with lots of fun things to do and good food too!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and fun. However, they had half the buildings closed to private events, so there was next to nothing to do."}
{"text":"Rawhide is quite the experience for a local!  It makes you realize what people expect to see when they come to Arizona on vacation.  A claim to fame is the canon used in the film \"Wild Wild West\" starring Will Smith.  My mom, boyfriend, and I went to the Steakhouse just inside the gates of Rawhide.  The service was prompt and friendly.  The restaurant is enormous, with both booths and tables available.  The cook wears a cowboy hat, and the servers are in costumes.  I paid $10.95 for a Ceasar salad with no meat, and it was pretty good.  The Sonoran Chicken platter received rave reviews at my table, and the Gambler, which is a fried appetizer dish, was also tasty.  I'd probably stick with the cafe on a future visit, but it was a good experience.  The candy shoppe is amazing!  They stock everything from Pez to SIxlets, and everything in between that you can't find anymore!  I must've spent $20 on the old-fashioned candy, and I've enjoyed everything I've eaten so far!  I would not go out of my way to come here again, but I will definitely be making time for a visit whenever an out-of-town guest is staying with me.  Oh and the best news of all is that I was able to avoid getting very dirty, even though the whole place of separate buildings stands on sand."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cheesy (okay super cheesy) but still ended up being fun and charming somehow!  I came here for a food festival, but at the end of the night I walked through Rawhide to see what it was all about.

The whole place is set up like a big main street in an old Western town from the 1880s.  They have a general store with quirky, cute, and probably overpriced candy and trinkets.  There is also a free tiny museum of the West with some neat old artifacts.  There's also a replica of a jail and jail cell.  One of the favorite parts was the blacksmith shop, where a real blacksmith was working and making branding irons.

This would be a great trip for out-of-town visitors, especially kids.  They'd get a big kick out of it!"}
{"text":"Oh dear, what has happened to Rawhide and the Steakhouse?!?!  I've been taking my kids to Rawhide for Thanksgiving for the past 3 years, and always had a wonderful time.  This year, the kids wrist bands to go on the rides/attractions were still $15, but the train is gone and the Stagecoach was MIA for 2 hours, so we spent $15 per kid for them to ride a burro.  The service at Thanksgiving dinner was the worst I've ever seen.  Hungry kids waited an hour and a half, to get Kraft mac-n-cheese and cold chicken strips.  My Thanksgiving dinner was so cold I sent it back.  The waiter brought out bill (at the 2 hour mark) without ever offering us coffee or the pie that came with dinner.  Three conversations with a manager got us no better service.  Sadly, this was the year I brought 10 friends with us.  So a party of 15 left determined to never return."}
{"text":"It was a warm October Friday night when I was literally blindfolded [something I wasn't to thrilled about since I  just had eyelash extensions done and it hurt so bad to have the fabric rubbing against them], thrown into the backseat of a car, dragged across this old western town still blindfolded and in heels, only to be released and freed when I was standing in front of a few dozen close family and friends for our rehearsal dinner.  Talk about  a surprise!

The in-laws threw us a very memorable rehearsal dinner filled with lots of different appetizers, salad, juicy steak, fluffy mashed potatoes, and way too many strong strong drinks.  The hosts were nice, the bartender was friendly, we got to keep some cool cowboy hats, and were dragged to their in-town prison for photos and an arrest warrant for \"gettin' hitched.\"  There might have been a mechanical bullride at the end of the night and I recall riding around on a children's wooden horse but like I said, the drinks were flowing and it was our rehearsal dinner so why not?  Huzzah!  Lots of out-of-state and out-of-country friends and family all had a lovely time out here in the desert and it was great times.

5-stars for the funnest rehearsal dinner ever!  Although really... don't wear heels to this place while blindfolded.  It was such a work-out!"}
{"text":"Overall we enjoyed our time.  The town is downright cool looking with all of the people in costume walking around.  They really stay in character and it makes it very fun.  We got a margharita right away and walked the town area, watching shootouts, etc.  We got my Mom arrested and then had dinner at the steakhouse.  Afterwards we had smores by the fire and talked.  My only complaint is that you literally can't hear the shows that they put on all over town (free ones) because they don't mic themselves.  Other than that we loved it and will be bringing our parents back when they visit in Feb!"}
{"text":"The food is literally some of the worst food I've had in Arizona. My company had their Christmas party here last year and it was a disappointment all around even though it was free. 

In the future save yourself some time and grill your own steak and watch a western movie at home."}
{"text":"Western Town with fun for everyone - great western store too - and homemade fudge!  Kids are never, ever ready to go home.  We've been back time and time again - wristbands for the kids = hours of rock climbing, petting zoo, burro rides.  Margaritas from Pete are the best - dinner in the Steakhouse is always extraordinary!"}
{"text":"I really liked our visit here (minus the steakhouse). The town is cute and really beautiful at Christmas.  Santa and the soap bubble snowfall and the lights and little stores are all very nice. I also like that they have plenty for the little ones to do, from the log ride (like bull ride) to the train to the hay ride to the horse rides to the petting zoo and beyond, there is lots to do...and for a $15 wrist band it is well worth it. My only complaint is the very limited operating hours. 5:30-8/9 f-sun. THREE DAYS ONLY and only very limits hours. We didn't get to do everything we wants to do because they were closing early on Sunday. I would recommend going right when they open that way you will have time to do most of what you want to do. 

PS: don't try to call this place. They don't answer their phones or return phone calls."}
{"text":"A friend recommend this place since it's a very touristy thing to do. I'm no BBQ expert, but the food at steakhouse was forgettable. 

Scouts Half Rack Ribs and 6 oz Top Sirloin (2 stars) - I was torn if I should order steak or ribs so I picked something that had both. The ribs were tender, but there was too much of the not so special BBQ sauce. The Top Sirloin didn't have sear or grill marks on the outside and just tasted bland and chewy. The sides were just okay. You can't really mess up corn on the cob, but I just didn't like the beans and Texas toast. 

Orange and Peach Cobbler (3 stars) - It was good dessert to end the dinner. It wasn't too sweet. The fruit was fresh and tart. 

Service (4 stars) - The entire staff was very nice and friendly. They were welcoming to regulars and tourists. 

There's live entertainment, which included only two people in a band playing country music. 
 
I will not be back if I'm in the area, and I don't think it's something to experience at least once. It's more ideal for families. It wasn't very busy for Saturday night. There were free shows outside. It's probably busier during the day. It's cute layout with different shops to buy a cowboy hat or dress up for a photo op."}
{"text":"I went to Rawhide with my ex boyfriends parents for a get together thrown by their company in the event room. They threw a great gig for that, and the food was well prepared. I remember it being so delicious and moist. I ate steak, a baked potato, there was bread, and then they did ice creams. I wanted to take my family down here for the experience, and was sourly disappointed.

Meh.

My steak was cooked okay, but nothing amazing. I've had better at Sizzler for tons cheaper. My boyfriend ate the rattle snake fried crap in a basket, and that was pretty disgusting. I guess it taste's like chicken (??? no thank you). There was no bread served with my meal, as I thought would have been when reading the menu.

The only perk I can say with this place is that they have good jalapeno corn bread muffins. I'm sure I can make those at home. Other than that, it's very Sizzler to me."}
{"text":"I go to Rawhide a couple times every year when I feel like steak.  They have a pretty good steakhouse.  

I also like the kitsch of the place.  The employees are always in character and they are really fun.  

On my last visit, I was there for the Easter Egg Hunt.  Parking was $5, which for dinner is no big deal, but for just an egg hunt was kind of annoying.  Then we get inside, a good 45 minutes before my kiddo's age group is supposed to go.  There was a line from nearly the entrance to about halfway down the main drag.  There were HUNDREDS of families waiting to get into this egg hunt.  The egg hunt was held in a small, closed off area where they typically have shows.  Children were only allowed to pick FOUR eggs.  They said they had more people than anticipated.  They should have sold tickets and limited the number of entrants!  I convinced my kiddo to skip it since it was super hot and so poorly planned, but I had to agree to walk around a bit.  We spent about $10 getting bottled water and an Easter cookie (which she still has not eaten).  Rawhide, the egg hunt situation was NOT cool.

I will be back again for dinner, but I won't go back for special events."}
