{"text":"Best Thai food ever!  I've had almost everything on the menu (it's quite small) and everything is delicious! My favourite dish is the Sukho Pad Thai. The fragrances, the taste, makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Get the garlic chicken as an appetizer - garlicky goodness!  I took away one star because it is absolutely impossible to get seats in a decent time on Friday or Saturday night (we waited almost 2 hours one time and theres nothing in the area to go to so you're standing outside the restaurant) Long wait for food too when you get seated. And even if you call to order food for pick up, it takes an hour before you can come pick it up."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food itself.   Minus a star because of the inconvenience of their delivery service. Sometimes it can take 90 mins for a delivery time to open up.   With that being said, this is - in my opinion - the best Thai food in Toronto. Their Tom Yum soup is ridiculously good; such a density of flavours, it just blows your mind.   Also the best Green Curry. At *medium spicy, it's the perfect marriage of sweet and hot.   The interior is smaaalll and the decor is very simple, clean, straightforward. Nothing to really remark upon. Getting to its location is an adventure in and of itself."}
{"text":"Terrible service  Came in with a group and most of the people at my table were done eating before I even got my food. Then I had to eat alone while 7 people stared awkwardly at me.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant around the area ! I've been impressed with most if not all the food I've tried here. It does get packed during rush hours. Khao soi was super delicious (and filling)"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a decent Thai restaurant...or at least I've had a hard time finding that perfect chicken and shrimp Pad Thai in Toronto. Sukhothai is the best I've come across so far...I always ask for extra peanuts tho.  I'd give the Pad Thai a solid 9/10.  My friends rate their meals a 10/10 (I forget what they order exactly...a coconut curry something).  We only do delivery."}
{"text":"Been there at least 7-8 x in the last 3mths. You folks are GUILTY of making a super wow chicken broth vegetable noodle soup that's spicey enough to incinerate my innards!!!...... And a very kind 'thank you' for that   Keep up the super fast service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Really delicious Thai Food, with great lunch specials.   Their spice levels are pretty intense, so unless you like it really hot, go for medium spice and that is more than enough.  They've done a really good job with the decor, much nicer than the previous restaurant that was in this spot.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I've found this food to be pretty good as far as Thai food goes. The wait staff is very friendly and the food comes out very quickly. The decor and location are both very nice with standard outdoor cafe seating during the nicer months and plenty of indoor seating. I've been there twice now and it's my standby restaurant if I want some good Thai food in the Laval area of Montreal."}
{"text":"Went around 5pm but the place wasn't too busy. Pad thai and kao soi were good. Got them spicy and they were manageable."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this location. The food was ok, but the service was crap. The table was sticky and dirty, they forgot my drink order, forgot to mention there was gratuity included, and took forever to bring my friend's change back. The waitress was very rushed and abrupt- unapologetically apparent in her annoyance that we were there. Hey man, I know it sucks working til 10 on a Saturday night, but try not to take it out on the rest of us."}
{"text":"Have eaten here sitting down as well as take out. We got fresh shrimp rolls, fried rolls, green curry (shrimp Thai spicy), and Sukho Pad Thai (chicken medium) the last time I was here. The Thai spicy is properly spicy so if you are on the fence in any direction you can always ask them to throw some fresh chilies on the side, the dishes get hotter over time if you do put them in. Green curry was great but the Pad Thai was fantastic, not too sweet, noodles weren't drenched or greasy, and had fantastic flavour. The rolls are also pretty impressive here. The staff is friendly and take out comes pretty fast. Finally the portions are big and with two starters, the two of us could have shared one main, we did not finish both. I will absolutely continue to go back here."}
{"text":"Great food! I had Khao Soi Chicken, Green (curry) Veggie & Garlic Beef all by myself. I couldn't finish all of them especially as each one has rice/noodle included. But all of them were really good.  For me, I like yellow curry the most, so Khao Soi is my dish. I love the rich, creamy flavour. It also has generous amount of chicken chunks inside that are surprisingly tender. I ordered the delivery, so the noodle and curry were separate.  Garlic Beef isn't bad. I'll probably order again because I love garlic flavour and meat made of red sauce (could be soy sauce). It isn't in a tender version though, beef slices are quite hard with probably no fat inside. I chose green curry for veggies. It was good also, glad to find it even has bamboo shoots inside. But after tried both yellow and green, next time I'll stick at yellow. The delivery charge is $5 plus tax. Isn't too bad for a winter night. I will order delivery all the time instead of dining in."}
{"text":"I like to go here for lunch. Best Thai restaurant near the financial district."}
{"text":"Not for Gluten Free or vegetable loving diners. The Khao Soi tofu takeout from Wednesday night was truest disappointment and still lingering with me-  The noodles were wheat egg noodles!! There were NO vegetables (unless we count 4 minuscule rounds of scallion)! When arriving home w takeout and excitedly opening containers, the noodles looked suspiciously of wheat. I called requesting noodle ingredients and received so much attitude of how inconvenient (on a Weds night) it was to check. Yep, wheat so I tossed them.  I ate the coconut curry broth which had fair flavor but no vegetables then immediately had a horrible whole body reaction. No, I had not done anything or eaten anything unusual in the previous 48 hours.  At pick-up I glanced at plates on tables noticing a dearth of vegetables.  Never returning, veggie-free/wheat noodle using Thai cuisine? What!! gluten intolerant and/or traditional Thai cuisine loving travelers beware."}
{"text":"Went to Sukhothai (Wellington location) for the first time last night after hearing great things.  Booked a table for 6 and changed it last minute to 10 people.  They were jammed but still made sure to accommodate the group.  Service was friendly and food was amazing. Everyone in the group loved their choice.   The biggest surprise came at the end when I asked for the bill (expecting one big bill to split) and the server asked me if I wanted split cheques. AMAZING. I covered three people's meals (including one beer) and the total with tip and tax was under $60. Not bad at all. Definitely looking forward to going back again to try something different. The only thing I would change is maybe lower the music a bit (hip hop which i generally love) while people are eating because when it's packed it's already pretty loud. Otherwise, perfection:)"}
{"text":"The BEST Thai food in the city (yeah, I said it).  I consider myself a regular at this Regent Park gem, and although I've tried almost everything on the menu, the main the reason I keep going back is their take on the popular Thai dish, Khao Soi. The quality of the ingredients used is best demonstrated by the tender beef, which just melts in your mouth. The curry-like soup/sauce is packed with coconut milk and spices, which results in a thick, rich, flavourful  broth, and is the perfect complement to the egg noodles and beef.   My other favourite would have to be their take on Pad Thai (appropriately coined \"Sukhothai Pad Thai\") which gets a lot of its flavour from the tamarind paste which is made in-house and distinguishes itself from most of the bland, flavourless, and dare I say it, ketchup-infused Pad Thai dishes offered by other establishments in the city.  Ask them to make your dishes \"Thai Spicy\" if you think you can handle it."}
{"text":"Lovely. Came here with two other friends and we all enjoyed our meals. I got the tom yum soup and khao soi with beef. I found that the tom yum was a bit grainy for my liking... I like the one at Pai a lot better. The price is also a bit steep at 6 dollars for a side bowl. The khao soi was filling and flavourful. I think the portion for this dish was plentiful and that there was a good balance between noodle and protein. Overall, the  service was good, the restaurant is bright and clean, and the food is yummy. Don't let the outside of the restaurant fool you!"}
{"text":"I've ordered several times from Sukho Thai through the app Maegan. Usually, the food is good, but the wait is long. Today, my order came, as usual - took about 90 minutes. When I received the food, I opened the package and noticed the curry was spilled all over with the lid popped open inside the bag. I called Sukho to ask them about this and all they did was blame Maegan saying its not their fault, don't call them back. Food is okay, but rudeness and service, 0 stars, averages at 2."}
{"text":"This location is a big improvement from the Parliament location. The food is presented better and the wait staff are better. The tofu is a little bit to soft for my tast but hey, that's just me. Will try again soon.  We have been back a few more times and upgraded our rating to four stars, nice place and busy."}
{"text":"Food was great, small menu. Not so friendly staff, but hey, I was not looking to marry them! Will go to the Dundas West location next."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Thai food but absolutely hate the wait times at most Thai restos downtown.This place is the perfect middle ground for good Thai food, a nice and spacious atmosphere, and good location.   Was it the best Thai food I ever had in my life? No. But on a Friday and Saturday, you best believe I'll go here over 2 hour wait times anywhere else. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Its good and reliable. The portions are fair and so is the price. I ordered tofu pad thai for pick up and the person on the phone was really nice and spoke perfect English . They seemed really busy when I got there and neither of the two wait staff paid any attention to me. To be honest it was kind if a turn off and I felt a bit uncomfortable just standing at the bar waiting to be greeted... The interior is really nice, its definitely a nice semi casual place to go. I wished that they included a lime chunk and some sauces with my order though.. And that they had been more attentive."}
{"text":"Food is average. Worst and most Rude service I have ever had in a restaurant. Firstly they don't come to your table for the longest time after they give you the menus. Yes they are busy, I understand that but I saw waiter/waitress just standing in a corner trying not to look around. Then when it was time for closing the waiter kept hovering around us as if \"you've to eat faster and leave\". Then He made a face when asked for take out box. The worst was when I was paying he looked at my receipt and saw me adding no tip he insisted saying \"mam that bill does not include tip\" YES he just asked for the tip for such shitty service. I was with someone so I had to tip. But will never ever go back to this place. Trust me people there are 100 Thai places in Toronto and the GTA, this shouldn't be the one to try. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"In celebration of a friend's birthday, I was invited out to Sukho Thai, the elder sister of Khao San Road. Being thirty minutes late (I know, my bad), I hustled my way around Little Portugal looking for the restaurant with the big elephant. A stranger from a far kindly pointed me towards the restaurant and claimed it was the best Thai restaurant he's ever been to. Quite skeptical, I deemed it as an overstatement.  The interior was covered with plenty of dark wood, intimate lighting and a rustic vibe. For a party of 20, we were all scattered around at different tables, as it was a fairly petite restaurant. Although this might not hold true for their other two locations.  Sukho Thai specializes in Northern Thai cuisine. Every dish brought to the table was full of pungent flavours, a kick of real heat and a comforting texture that surely succeeded in hitting many high notes on my taste buds. I ordered the Khao Soi and Gaeng Panang curry. It was funny because all their dishes have authentic Thai names so as we were asking each other what we ordered, we spewed out names we could barely pronounce. Luckily a precise description of each dish was described on the menu.  The Khao Soi was listed as one of Sukho Thai's specialty. It was a bowl of yellow al dente noodles submerged in a thick and creamy curry gravy splattered in coconut milk and chili oil with cubes of beef mixed throughout topped with deep fried crispy noodles. It was a dish packed with exotic flavours, tolerable heat and a combination of chewy and crunchy textures. I was so in love with the thick curry sauce, I ordered a second bowl of jasmine rice to make sure every bit of that sauce was devoured. It was truly a soul warming bowl of curry, perfect for a cold winter night.  The second dish I ordered was the Gaeng Panang Curry. It was a plate of panang curry (a type of mild curry in Thailand), kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, red and green peppers cooked with coconut milk and chicken. This curry is unlike any Thai curry I've had before. It's very fragrant in smell, rich in flavours, more savoury than sweet and absolutely delightful with a bowl of jasmine rice.  With all their dishes, you have the choice of different proteins such as beef, chicken and tofu and different levels of heat ranging from mild, medium, spicy and Thai spicy. For both of my dishes, I asked for spicy and I would say it was a considerable amount of heat given my strong tolerance for spiciness. Portions were on the smaller side but I was caveman hungry so that could just be biased."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about this restaurant at first but don't let the appearance from the outside scare you off. I admit, I was thrown off by the frontage and the tiny establishment, but thankfully I still stepped inside. When seated, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao, the texture of the noodles were perfect with great seasoning. It wasn't soggy or greasy which was definetly the highlight for me. I was also blown away by the authentic taste of the Gaeng Garee and the Gaeng Panang (both curries btw). They were packed with a lot of flavour and were very delicious. The Casava Cake is also a definite must dessert to get! (not too sweet and very tasty!).This place is really authentic and is a great place to get Thai food! To my surprise, the service was also very friendly as it's run by a traditional Thai family. They gave off the impression that they genuinely appreciated my patronage.. so Thai food lovers, do yourselves a favour and check this place out, it'll be a great experience. Truly a hidden gem. Too bad it's out of my area.. :("}
{"text":"So I still hadn't made it to the original location, but was glad to see one open up fairly close to me.  We went on a Friday night just days after the opening.  The place is trendy and has an open concept seating plan, which is nice.  The shrimp chips, which everyone talks about,  were nothing special in my mind.  I couldn't handle more than two!  The best dishes were the special Sukhothai pad thai and the green curry.  I've been to Thailand, and I make a kicker pad thai myself, but I LOVED this.  Not too oily, but well flavoured and the perfect amount of spice.  The green curry was good, but not comparable to authentic thai in Thailand!  The main complaint would be the staff.  They are clearly out to lunch.  As soon as you walk in they appear confused.  When you sit down, before you even take your jacket off, the waitress is hovering to ask if you want a drink.  I was starting to get irritated fairly quickly.  Then she was coming back every 30 seconds until we decided our order.  We ordered starters and a main meal, but she brought everything out together and we felt rushed.  Then, when I needed her to refill my water and to ask for hot sauce, she was no where to be found.  Initially, I thought it was just our waitress that was like that, but it seemed like everyone was just on another planet there.  This place has potential, but they really need to improve their customer service."}
{"text":"A lively place on a Saturday night...environment was modern and open concept, the noise level was high, at times it was likely you were yelling to the person across from you.  Had the garlic chicken app, which was jammed packed with garlic...make sure you bring a breath mint if you Plan on ordering this,   The khoa soi was very much like the Khoa San restaurant dish. I understand the chef who created the menu at KS is the same one at the sukho thai restaurant...but I was expecting a bit of variety.  Overall, after having been to Khoa San a few times, felt the food I ordered at this place was good but did not stand out all that much."}
{"text":"The food is an excellent, been to this place since they opened years ago. Probably the best Thai food in Toronto and my favourite place to go as well. The wait a bit longer but can't complain since the food is too good."}
{"text":"When we arrived to Sukho Thai on Dundas, they  \"had no record\" of our reservation for an 8 person party, and didn't apologize about the inconvenience. We waited an extra hour beyond our reservation time for a table. One of our drinks didn't arrive, and it took 45 minutes to get the drink without the server acknowledging the wait time. Nobody brought water despite the fact that the host/manager was often looking around the room and bussing tables. The server was quite rude. I suppose that's the type of service you can give when you know that there is a large party gratuity included. She managed to smile and act human with smaller parties for her tips.        It is likely a reflection of the poor management that the staff are so unhappy and unprofessional. Awful service that is not worth withstanding for the average food."}
{"text":"This place rarely ever disappoints.   If what you're in the mood for is good, tasty comfort food then you've come to the right place.  The green and red curry are yummy. The Pad Thai is not made with ketchup (yuk!). Most of the dishes on the menu are delicious and very filling.   The only downside is how fattening the food is. It can sometimes be overly greasy and the cooks should probably turn it down a notch with the sugar and salt.   You should definitely try it out. Chances are, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Spring rolls: yum. Shrimp rolls: yum! Must sample again. Tom Kha Gai: yum!! Good heat level, ordered spicy."}
{"text":"MMM this place has some very tasty food. We always get the fresh rolls with peanut sauce, some coconut soup, and the special curry noodles (with lots of rice on the side because the 'soup' is like a rich sauce). My mouth is drooling as I type this.   Excellent food aside the location is wonderfully decorated and cozy and the prices are very fair."}
{"text":"It's tasty, but it's inconsistent. It's yummy, but it's pretty average. Sometimes it's a little to greasy or salty. But overall, have always had good service going there."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city! The Sukho Pad Thai is to die for - every time I go I always order it. I haven't even had the chance to try anything else on the menu, the pad Thai is that good. This location is great for lunch, but it's always busy so come early.  Service is always great and food never takes too long to come out. Lots of seating and overall amazing place."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the city. Authentic food, great service, comfortable space. Have literally tried everything on the menu and never been disappointed.   Khao soi, yellow curry and obviously, Pad Thai are all excellent here."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai is a Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto. I came here for iftaar during Ramadan. Turns out I was not the only one. About two other parties were there for the same reason. We ordered the Kao Sey (please excuse spelling errors of there are any) and the Pad Thai. It was phenomenal food! The service was excellent and so was the environment. I 100% recommend this place for you and your family: Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner as a group of 10. Food was good. I tried the Panang Chicken curry. Was surprised that there was very little sauce and was served on a flat dish and not a bowl. The red and green curries that my friends ordered had more sauce and were in a bowl. Nevertheless, the food was amazing. Great flavors.   Service was efficient, our server told us upfront that for a group of 10 on a Friday evening he would not be able to do separate bills. 15% gratuity was included.   Good food, full of flavor, reasonably priced. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Couldn't get into Pai at 9:30 on a Saturday night so came here instead. Not a bad alternative. We were seated right away and the food came out promptly. We had Panang salmon (wonderfully cooked and presented) and the garlic beef, which was flavorful but a tad over-cooked. Spring rolls were passable."}
{"text":"Good food but long waiting for the dish to be served. Like the curry noodle here! Full of meat and strong curry flavor."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are obsessed with this place.  When they first opened, we came in at least once a week.  I've read some reviews here about there being horrible service, but I've had only good service there.  The staff is always really friendly.  Not to mention they have the best calamari in the city."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I'm really disappointed with this location because I always liked the Sukhothai chain. This is my second visit to the location and apparently they can't tell the difference between chicken and shrimp. I paid extra for my shrimp."}
{"text":"It's a busy restaurant, but it's always worth the wait. The best Thai restaurant in the city that I've tried. The staff are well aware of various food allergies, such as gluten intolerance. This location is better than their newer location on Wellington Street."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in the city. I have had nothing but great customer service and great food. For the first time in ages, I don't have to add additional chili to my food when I ask for \"Thai spicy\". I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I like the Red Curry with Squash (served with rice).  This dish reminds me the meals I had in Thailand."}
{"text":"First came here with my girlfriend, immediately after arriving in Toronto for vacation. Service was a little slow, but the restaurant was packed, so I can forgive that. The meals were were quite good, with no complaints on this matter. The atmosphere was fine, certainly better than the gaudy Asian-themed establishments I have witnessed elsewhere. Not being from Canada, we were not familiar with the payment machines in use, and the staff were friendly in helping us navigate the system.  On our second visit, because we were hungry and didn't want to venture far for a meal, service was greatly improved compared to the first time. They politely requested that we switch to another table, to make room for a large party. They thanked us for the trouble with a free appetiser.   Overall, a good value for the food and service."}
{"text":"Best Thai food outside of Thailand. Period.  It's also a pretty good place for a date!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall. Thai iced tea was delicious and all the food we ordered was so good. Reasonable prices and good portions. Friendly staff and fast service. Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"Long wait.  (1.5 hours!!!) a cold breeze rushes in every time the door was opened.  I ordered their chicken pad thai and garlic fried shrimps.  Pad thai was mediocre while the garlic shrimps were hardly authentic.  It was not worth the 1.5 hours of wait time.  If you're looking for good thai,  try Kinnare by ellesmere"}
{"text":"Unbelievably fresh ingredients. Amazing decor and very nice ambiance. One on the highest end Asians in Laval"}
{"text":"Ive tried everything on the menu. It was all amazing. I just love the food here and make it a routine stop at least twice a week. I bring and tell friends and they are there as often as me now. The people are friendly and the environment is pleasant. I forgot to mention that before Sukhothai I never really cared for Thai food. Allot of other venues soured my apetite. Sukho did the opposite. A must try in Toronto..."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of THE BEST service I have ever received.   The managers and waiters we're extremely on point and provided my group with excellent customer service.   This team here has the utmost integrity and makes amazing food!!  I recommend the coconut curry tom yum - REALLY good if you're a soup fanatic such as myself. The shrimp fresh rolls were well crafted and the ingredients were FRESH! The Thai ice tea I found it to be delicious, I do however have a sweet tooth, if you don't I would suggest asking for half sweet, or dilute it with water like my friends did. Their Khao Soi specialty was delicious as well. It had just the right amount of textures incorporated to make it a satisfying dish. They don't cheap out on the portions either.   Definitely my number 1 spot for some hardy, real authentic thai food with amazing service."}
{"text":"I rarely give five stars unless the food is that deserving. You absolutely have to try their Khao Soi!  If you're looking to upgrade your Thai experience, look no further than Sukho Thai for amazing combinations in flavour and aromas. My friend and I ordered their shrimp chips, fresh shrimp rolls and Khao Soi. Note: The fresh shrimp rolls are the best healthy appetizer option and the vegetables together are colourful and have a nice crunch to them.   The presentation and generous size of our Khao Soi is also noteworthy.   My only minor complaint would be the curry to noodle portion could be adjusted; more noodles would be better, as you literally have a soup of curry left afterwards. Tip: This makes for great leftovers! Their packaging is also great - no crappy styrofoam - just sturdy plastic containers! I'm not the biggest fan of curry, but their food has won me over - for their richness and creaminess.   To top it off, our server (the girl with the arm tatts) was courteous and attentive, refilling our waters, and that just complimented the amazing food. I'll definitely be back to sample their other dishes!"}
{"text":"my review is not about the food, which has been good most times I have been.   I went in to get 3 dishes and an appetizer for takeout for company eating at home for a late lunch. Told it would be ready in 15 min, stepped out because no place to really wait, it was full. Returned in 25 min, only to find myself locked out. Waited, and after a few glances at me, no one came to the door.   Luckily I did have my cell phone with me and found their # posted on a restaurant review pasted on their window. Called and explained I had come to pick up my order and door was locked. Muffled conversation, and finally someone came to open the door, puzzled that I was hear to pin up an order. Anyways to make a long story short - after confused looks all around, they totally forgot about my order and told me it was still coming. I finally found out - it hadn't even been ordered yet and they were just putting it thru then. I mean this is a tiny place with a handful of orders at a time. I was very disappointed because I specifically came hear after telling my out of town company that I would bring them some nice Thai food. My money was refunded and an apology was given. But it didn't help me and I went rushing elsewhere to get some takeout! I am surprised at such a small place's lack of organization in their service.  Moral of my story - if you order takeout, don't leave, stay around counter until your food is in hand."}
{"text":"Love their pad thai n garlic chicken.. This is probably the best thai food in toronto by far.."}
{"text":"Food is great my favourite Khao Soi.  Service is terrible ! Need improvement I ask for extra lime with my pad Thai but I was told they can't give it to me cause it doesn't go with that dish. I understood the concept but I said its my preference I will pay for it. They agreed to give me the limes. When I'm food came out the limes didn't. I constantly have to remind them to bring it out for me."}
{"text":"I have tried Sukho Thai a few times before and wonder if the quality has decreased. They recently changed their menu (increased prices and changed some items). The mango juice used to be a thicker, almost slushie-like bigger portion and now it resembles something poured out of a can or carton in a smaller glass. On this visit, the deep-fried calamari was crispy and seasoned, came with a sweet-chili dipping sauce. The panang curry with chicken was tasty, but I wish they served it with more curry in a bowl rather than a plate (makes it hard to scoop onto the accompanying white rice). The shrimp pad thai had five large shrimp. The taste of the pad thai was good, a slightly sweet, sour and salty flavour.  The atmosphere is lively, good for a group (as long as you speak loudly). The exposed brick causes sound to bounce off the walls quite a bit."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I'm here at least once a month for sure. By far the best thai food in Toronto!!   I've tried most of the food here and my favourite is the garlic chicken and red curry. The garlic chicken just has the right flavour and it's a must try. The red curry and panang are amazing and have a good spiciness to it and it's so yummy!   The place is very affordable and the portions are huge so they are great for sharing."}
{"text":"The food is always, and I mean always consistently excellent!! This is probably the best Thai food I've ever had.  The sukhothai pad Thai is a must try!"}
{"text":"Simply awesome!!  Went there for lunch, good service. Looks like a well kept secret in Toronto, probably due to their location east of the financial district.  Shall visit again."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUKHO THAI =D it is my favourite thai place so far.  we had 2 starters, 2 main dishes, 2 desserts.  2 starters:  - Shrimp Chips with tamarind dip ($2.50) - the portion is pretty big. It taste pretty good! - Garlic Chicken ($8) - I LOVE it! it's so crispy! however, not much garlic flavour in it.  2 main dishes: - Pad thai ($10.25) - It's authentic! the most yummy yummy pad thai I have tried so far in Canada. It's not another \"tomato sauce\" pad thai at other thai places.. It's a bit spicy and sour.. it's just soo good! =D - Panang Curry with basil leaves (with chicken) and rice ($8.75) - it's also pretty good, but i prefer the pad thai. nothing \"REALLY\" special about the curry.  2 desserts: - Cassava Cake ($2.50) - made from cassava, coconut milk, and coconut strips. It has a strong coconut taste, it's pretty good!! I like it!! - Tapiocca with coconut milk ($3) - I LOVE tapiocca so I ordered it. It's nothing special but it's yummy yummy!  The place is pretty small and packed. I went there at 5ish PM and around 6ish, there is already A LOT of people waiting outside for a table. So better get there early!  The service is really good, the waitress is friendly! They would explain and recommend dishes to you.  And the prices are pretty fair! Fair price & good food! You just gotta go there & try it out!!!"}
{"text":"i LOVE this place. obsessed really. actually, our entire office is obsessed with this place. correction, obsessed with the food - the place isn't so great since it's a tiny whole in the wall with hardly any seating and at least 1.5 hour wait during peak lunch time for pickup and don't even bother with delivery.   however, that only took away one star because the food is THAT fantastic. all of their curries are flavourful and rich with coconut milk and spices unlike soupy bland curries of other thai places in the city. my favourite dish is the paneng red curry, i get it mild and ask for chillies on the side because sometimes medium heat comes blazing hot and other times not quite so.   you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. pick your favourite thai dish be it the curries or pad thai or appetizers like spring rolls and you'll find them all perfectly done."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai a.k.a pretty darn yummy. Hands down the BEST thai food I've had in Toronto, though admittedly my forays into thai cuisine have not been very extensive. However, a short-lived #1 is still better than nothing in my opinion :).  I fell in love with the green curry at Sukho Thai, and consequently Sukho Thai itself, due to the multi-dimensional flavors that seem to be infused within the curry, a feat which I have not experienced in any other Thai restaurant.   To compare the best with something not so great, I very recently had green curry chicken at Asian Bowl near Yonge and Dundas and it was not only too sweet to be green curry (since green curry is known to be the spiciest of thai curries) but when i asked for extra spicy, they simply added more chilies to it. So in effect, the flavors of the curry were not as one, but more segregated - the sweet curry on one hand and the spiciness of the chilies on the other. It tasted flat and bland and representative only of the coconut milk itself, so compared to Sukho thai, whose curry was a marriage of its different dimensional qualities, Asian bowl's was more of like a divorce, or a separation waiting to be one.  I've had the pad thai as well at Sukho Thai and it was O.k, not the best in my opinion, so I continue to be on the lookout.  But as for the green curry, I think I've found where green curry dies and goes to heaven."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with many different options. Pad Thai is great - personally I stick with the original kind since I find it tastes fresher. Try the nua gra teaum. It's the beef dish served with egg. Good for those looking for more meat."}
{"text":"Stumbled into Sukho Thai on a sunny weekend for lunch. The staff was more than accommodating for our party of 10 plus. For our large party, the ambiance was quite intimate and service was efficient and on point. Ordered the pad thai and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty mediocre.  Pretty bland and not much flavourful.  Would not go here again.  PAI is much better"}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner for 6 people. There was a 30 minute wait but there is a beautiful fountain outside so we just went and hung out there. Came in and they got us all seated. Most of our party ordered beef khao soi and loved it!! It was slow Cooked. I had masaman curry with rice. It was creamy and had peanuts. Typical thai flavour.  Overall nice place to go to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is over hyped. The food tastes good but it's not worth the price.   My friend ordered the chicken pad thai and they forgot to put the sprouts and green onions on it. So it came out looking like a brown blob of noodles with a few pieces of chicken and no vegetables. It didn't look appetizing at all.   I'm a vegetarian so I can't have any of the curries since they have shrimp paste. I was able to get a veggie pad thai without the oyster sauce. It tasted alright but I was asked if i wanted tofu or vegetables. Why the hell can't I have both?   I felt like I was being chinced. Two mains, an appetizer and a 10% tip the total came to $40 for lunch. For that price I can sit in a much nicer place like Golden Thai where they'll make something special for a vegetarian and I won't leave feeling ripped off."}
{"text":"It's a local fav of mine and I can't stress how good the food is.  Thai spicy is VERY spicy!  I love it.  And if you're going get an appetizer I would suggest the Tofu bites... they're delicious!   The portions are decent and it makes it easy to order a bunch of dishes to share amongst friends."}
{"text":"Personnellement, je suis un gars de carry et j'ai vraiment aimé le leur!"}
{"text":"Some friends who visit regularly had very good things to say about Sukho Thai so I was eager to try it out myself. My dining companion had made reservations for dinner on a weeknight, but the reservation was not in the books when I arrived. There were lots of tables available, so I was seated right away. My dining companion arrived only a few minutes later and we were served water immediately. Overall, the service was quick and attentive. The menu is much smaller than most Thai restaurants in the city. Some typical signature dishes, which I found to be just average. Overall, the food is lacking in flavour and presents as a bit bland and mediocre.  Would I visit again? I'd like to give it another chance as my visit may not have been typical."}
{"text":"Tons of flavour. Highly recommend the Khao Soi ($13). The Masaman Curry is also good, but the tamarind was a tad bit overpowering. The Thai Iced Tea was awesome, highly recommended.  A little bit more expensive than Salad King, but worth it.  Can be crowded, the flooring could be better (whenever waiters walk by, you can feel it), and can be noisy at times."}
{"text":"Their Sukho Thai pad thai is one of the finest in the city. If you want to spice it up, order it thai spicy and be prepared for chilli happiness."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment Monday last week for dinner with a couple of friends.  The ambiance is warm, and we were seated by the window, which was nice.  I had the tofu masaman curry, which was very flavorful, served with rice.  My friend had the Sukho Thai pad thai, which is one of the best pad thai's I've ever tasted.  The only thing I thought could use improvement was the mango salad.  It was decent, but not spectacular.  My other friend ordered a soup (I believe it was the guaytiaw, but I'm not sure) and wasn't too impressed.  Since I did not try it myself, I cannot base my review on it, but figured it was worth mentioning.  Would definitely be back though :)"}
{"text":"This place serves actual authentic Thai food...I have seen employees from other Thai restaurants, such as Papaya go here when they are done their shift.  The garlic tofu and the curries are amazing!  The soups are well made as well.  If you want decor and exceptional service than look elsewhere- if you want real Thai food than this place is a must!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times, and every time, the food does not disappoint!!   The service is hit or miss, especially during rush dinner services, but the delicious food makes up for it. The shrimp rolls are delicious, and the pad thai and massaman curry is crave worthy!!! (Mouth is currently watering just thinking of it)  Will definitely continue to visit and recommend this place to anyone who craves thai!"}
{"text":"Very good food for the price point. Our server was extremely sweet and friendly. One of the best parts about this restaurant is that the service is super quick. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Long line ups and pricey as well. After you eat, everything you paid for will be worth it. Must eat this place"}
{"text":"Sukhothai is owned by the husband-and-wife duo, Jeff and Nuit Regular. Having brought us other popular Thai restaurants around the city, they've got some serious cred.  What went in my belly:  Thai Iced Tea ($4) - Tasty but very sweet and creamy. Don't order this if you want something light and refreshing.  Shrimp Chips - with tamarind dip ($5). They were really, really addictive. They tasted great on their own but I also liked the sweetness from the tamarind dip. They'd make for a great bar snack!  Garlic Chicken ($9). The bite-sized pieces of chicken were nicely fried and weren't greasy at all. Crisp and garlicky with a bit of sweet and sour sauce. Another great sharing appetizer!  Tom Yum Kung - hot and sour shrimp soup with herbs ($6). The server asked us what spice level we preferred and decided on medium. It was actually quite spicy but so. damn. good. It had a strong cilantro flavour and was easily one of the best tom yum soups I've had. Don't miss out!  Khao Soi - yellow noodles in curry gravy with beef ($14). If you've ever had the one from Khao San Road, this dish is almost identical. Sweet and rich with chunks of tender beef and topped with crispy noodles. Delicious!  SukhoThai Pad Thai ($14). One of the city's best pad thai's! Not the goopy ketchupy stuff that I've had a few too many times.  Gaeng Panang - panang with Thai basil, tamarind sauce, onions and deep fried shallots ($12). We ordered the tofu version and unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan of this. Easily the least memorable dish of the meal. It was just...bland. Maybe it was cause was ordered tofu?  Cassava Cake ($4). It was soft like a rice cake and had just the right amount of sweetness.   Overall, I really enjoyed the food at Sukhothai. Being a fan of all their other Thai ventures, Jeff and Nuit Regular can seem to do no wrong!"}
{"text":"I regularly order take out from this location however the inconsistency has been less than stellar. The first few times I ordered Gaeng Panang, it came in a 500mL container. The most recent time (before tonight), it came in a 375mL container; I assumed this was a mistake.  Then, tonight it came in a 250mL container. This small size and standard flavour is not worth $13. My boyfriend and I both agreed tonight that it's time to find a new go-to Thai restaurant in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The green curry, red curry and pad kee mao are my favourites. Always make a reservation, the wait can br long."}
{"text":"By far, the best Thai food I've *ever* had!  Sukhothai's menu isn't huge, but every morsel of food we put in our mouths was pure deliciousness! We shared Pad Thai (which was *real* pad thai and not ketchup-y), mango salad, tom yum kung, and an order of egg rolls. It was all very fresh, perfectly spiced, and simply delicious. To top it all off, the staff was extremely nice.   I rarely take the TTC and, while there is some parking on Parliament, there were about 5,000 cabs parked there (it must be some kind of taxi hub), so finding a parking spot was slightly difficult. Still, if you are a fan of Thai food, you should make every effort to eat at Sukhothai. It was FANTABULOUS!"}
{"text":"Excellent Guaytiew (thai pho) and friendly and welcoming service.  The cook from northern thailand has a great philosophy on cooking wholesome thai food.  Will go again."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai, it was actually better thai food here than in Thailand. Love the Khao Soi, garlic chicken, shrimp rolls, spring rolls and the tom kha gai (soup). Husband love the pad thai.  Only downside is portion sizes, fairly small."}
{"text":"I echo previous sentiments: Best Thai in Toronto.  Highly recommended - Sukhothai Pad Thai & Khao Soi. Great value."}
{"text":"When a chef who worked for 9 years at Scaramouche, my favourite restaurant in the city, I listen. And when he wrote about this place in the Globe & Mail, I had to check it out.  The Gaeng Masaman is by far the best I have ever tasted and my wife had the Red Curry. Not as creamy as uptown at Joy Thai, but exceptional none the less. The warmed tapioca and coconut dessert dish was delicious and the spring rolls, although fried, were anything but greasy and positively perfect.  After years of flat, uninspiring chain food like Spring Rolls, this place makes flavours jump to life.   The service can be a little bit erratic, but it's pure Thai in its serving culture and style. Don't even think about waiting. Go."}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing the food here because my boyfriend and I got takeout recently. We ordered a pad thai and green curry. Both were stellar! Didn't have the issue of having an overly sweet (or dare I say, \"ketchupy\") padthai that you get from some places, and the green curry was flavourful and complex tasting. Would recommend this place in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Read a review in Tonic magazine for this place so headed down to the Parliament St. location with expectations for hot, fresh delicious food. Yikes!  Spring rolls looked suspiciously perfect (food service product?). They came to the table at room temperature. Had to ask for them to be heated up. Waitress okay but definitely not friendly.  Deep fried tofu was the best dish we ordered. Hot, fresh looking and tasting and light batter. Nice.  The vegetable pad thai was awful. Chewy undercooked greasy noodles, very few vegetables - lame.  The vegetable curry dish was served at slightly warmer than room temperature. Thick goopy curry sauce. Not particularly tasty. Very small portion.  The white rice was good.  Over priced. Not reflective of the poor quality of the food or the \"we slapped it together ourselves\" decor.  My wife and I both suggest going elsewhere for your thai food fix."}
{"text":"After eating 3 different dishes here 3 different times (2 delivery, one in restaurant), I can now say this place makes truly delicious food."}
{"text":"The most authentic Khao Soi I've had all day! Make sure to get the Thai Iced Tea as well! It's so sweet like the managers that helped."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai is by far the best thai food I've had in Toronto.  The restaurant is small and clean, and absolutely unassuming. You might never wander to Parliament and Dundas, and even if you do, pass right by this cozy little shop.  But you would be missing out on some incredible food.  I went with a small group, and we ordered some curries and noodle dishes to share, I was able to try the Panang and Masaman curries as well as the Pad Thai and an amazing curried beef-noodle dish.  Everything was of impeccable quality, and served on quaint little teardrop plates and bowls.  The tofu is really well done, firm and tasty and cut differently to match the dish it's in.  Made fresh to order, you choose how hot you want your dishes ranging from mild to \"Thai Spicy\", and they are happy to provide a home made chili infusion if you need more kick.  The shrimp chips with spicy tamarind paste started the meal off, and we finished with some lovely tapioca pudding.  For more food than we could possibly eat, we walked away for a scant $12 plus tip.  The service is great, and the take-out line was busy the whole time we were there. For an authentic Thai experience, Sukho Thai cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Comfortable seating and atmosphere but definitely not authentic Thai food. I ordered a Red Curry and there was so much squash in it I felt like I was eating squash puree/soup.   Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Thai food but great prices and excellent selection!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! One of my favorite restaurants. Good pricing and great taste. Highly recommended! A++"}
{"text":"Must try their Sukho Thai Pad Thai. If you like spicy choose the med spice , otherwise mild.  The best dish in the restaurant and one of the best pad thai with exploding flavours."}
{"text":"Still great, but prices have increased.  Main dishes are now over $10/pax."}
{"text":"Back again.. this time I tried the tofu green curry, and it was delicious, but I didn't find it as memorable as the red curry with squash.   The green curry has fewer vegetables - mostly just bamboo shoots and peppers, but lots of tofu. I'd recommend kicking it up a few notches on their spicy scale (the owner will definitely review the spicy scale with you) - I got medium and it was pretty mild!   We also shared an order of spring rolls. They were deep friend and packed with mushrooms.  If you can, eat early! When we arrived at about 5:15 p.m., every table was empty, and it remained fairly quiet until after 6 p.m. Takeout did seem pretty hectic though."}
{"text":"The food here is 5 stars, seriously. The flavors are complex, the dishes are well portioned and priced right. But mostly the food is amazing! Tried the sukho thai pad thai which had peanuts and tamarind as pretty dominant flavours, the NUA GRA TEAUM which is thin strips of garlicky sweet beef served with rice and a fried egg. Lastly the massaman curry which was what tied the meal together. Peanuts and coconuts were the main flavors. Its amazing and I ended up spooning it over my pad thai because im a pleb and also because it was delicious. The garlic chicken, while still good, was forgettable.   HOWEVER...try calling this place. They answer on average on the 7th try bc they are so busy so it is understandable. The place is always packed when I go and wait times for the dish can be a bit long, but its worth it. The servers run around with chickens without heads though. Forgetting/not refilling water, forgetting cutlery, just sloppy service."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, though the specials seemed a bit light on the vegetables--I ordered the fish special, which came out of the kitchen as a slab of battered fish, a mound of rice, and a tiny bowl of mango salad.  I wish there had been more of the salad, as it was delicious, and the rest of the meal was too heavy by far.  Service was friendly, but the noise in the room made it hard to hear my dining companion.  I really wanted to like this place, but I don't know if I'd eat in again--I hear that takeout service is great, so I'll probably take advantage of that next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Sukho Thai a few times for lunch/dinner and always had a great experience. The meals are well portioned, easy to share family-style, and the service is always excellent, which is very rare in Toronto. The atmosphere is really nice although it can get loud in the evenings."}
{"text":"This a very loud, busy, and popular restaurant, so make sure you are okay with waiting (or make a reservation) before you come by. It seems to attract a 20s-30s professional crowd. I ordered the Sukhothai Pad Thai and it was probably the best pad thai I have ever had. My friends also enjoyed their dishes, although there was one comment that the spiciest option wasn't as spicy as expected. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I get delivery from here. You can't go wrong with the house special pad thai, and the garlic tofu is amazing! I had the casava cake once and it was heaven. I am never disappointed when I order from either location."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto and read (via Yelp) about this place before arrival. My dinner guest having traveled to, and studied in, Thailand several times proclaimed it as 'close as it gets to the real thing'-echoing similar sentiments found throughout other's reviews. For me, it was a SPECTACULAR introduction to a food i'd never tried, served by people who actually CARED and knew what the hell they were talking about. It's a small, simply decorated, straightforward space you'd be forgiven for walking past if you didn't know to look for it. LOOK FOR IT. It's WELL worth it!"}
{"text":"The food here is really, really tasty and they usually have on some old school hip-hop playing which helps with the vibe. Definitely the best thai food I have ever had and a place every torontonian should visit!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but I prefer the hole in the wall experience of the Parliament location better than the bar-turned-resto down on Wellington.  One tactic that seems to work for us is to order for takeout and if a table opens up while waiting for our food they'll seat us and plate our dinner in the restaurant.  Win win because I live nearby so bringing the food home is just as good in case we can't be seated.  Otherwise, prepare to wait a long time for a table.  The food is amazing, I've gone enough times to have tried everything on the menu.  It's hard for me to pick a favourite dish - I love them all.   Definitely go to Parliament and not Wellington, that's my only tip."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the city. Suko Thai is our favourite Thai place in Toronto and is the best Thai we ever had. Fresh flavourful and to die for Thai food. Service is great as well. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Kept we waiting an extra 20 min for pick-up and since when do they use crappy chilly flakes? Really going downhill"}
{"text":"If you're in Toronto and looking for Thai food, this is the place to go. It's at Dundas and Parliament... not the best of neighborhoods. Order the sukhothai pad Thai (chicken or beef) on your first trip. Go mild... they can be a little unpredictable with their spice levels.   Service is crap... but really, best Thai food."}
{"text":"Bad service, mediocre food. Especially server Paul made me never want to go back to this place again. Long story short, manager eventually apologized on his behalf and wanted me to justify for his bad attitude because Paul is Thai. What kind of excuse is that? If you enjoy good food and good overall experience, this place is not for you.  **ordered green curry and it need more curry paste, all I can taste was coconut milk and salt. I've had better."}
{"text":"Keep going there and every time I wonder why.  Probably, the first few times, it was good.  But I can confidently say that it is not good anymore.  Went there for lunch today (for the last time) it was awful.  Not much to do withThai food, more cheap American Chinese.   The place was also empty on a Friday noon...  Should tell you something.    For three of us for the lunch menu: $140+ tip - one bottle of average wine.  It 10pm and I am still feeling the food.  Not a good feeling..."}
{"text":"I just went last night. Had the Garlic chicken for an app- it was cooked perfectly, with a little warmth balanced from the sweet sauce; larger than i expected, definitely no problem sharing. Then I had the shrimp pad thai, and requested medium, and was immediately glad I did, because I LOVE spicy food, but any hotter and I don't think i would have enjoyed it as much. It was sweet without being overpowering, and the taste was awesome."}
{"text":"Went with co-workers on a Friday. We got to the restaurant at about 11:30 or so. Gave in our orders. We didn't START getting our food until about 45 mins later. Worse part is that the food didn't arrive together! They served food by meal. The khao soi got served together then the curries got served together, then the fried rice, then the pad thais. When I say together, I mean for a bunch of tables, not just ours.   I understand being busy but serving tables by food type is just plain inefficient. No wonder there's always a line. It was either wait for everyone's food to arrive and eat your dish cold or start eating and wait for the people to finish.   My pad thai was great but the service took too much out of the experience.   As we were a party of 7, we had to pay 17% gratuity. I don't mind paying tips but I don't think the service was worth 17%.   The taste is worth a try but I wouldn't really go back if given the option."}
{"text":"In summary, I agree with the rating and the quality of the food. The only problem I had was the portion of Khao soi...   The front door wasn't too impressive, mixed in with well with the surrounding neighborhood. But once you got in, its like another world as the restaurant was recently renovated and with loads of waitress/waiter bussing in the restaurant.  We ordered two noodle dishes: - sukhothai pad that - the portion was huge and we can taste loads of fish sauce. I would say it's more of an acquired taste. - Khao soi - noodles with curry sauce, very tasty, but the portion was tiny. Both noodles and chicken chunks (approx 5 pieces)....  However... if you mix the pad thai into the curry sauce from Khao soi. .. it tastes deadly good!!!!!!!!! So good that folks next to our table followed :)  Service was average comparing to similar restaurant in this price point."}
{"text":"Definitely the most authentic green curry I have tried in Toronto! Everyone in my party liked their food. Service was good. Prices were not expensive at all."}
{"text":"I know. Sukho Thai doesn't need yet another rave review. But it certainly deserves it.  The food is excellent. I've been there several times, and earlier in the evening, you can actually get a table without waiting in the cramped ground-floor area - they do have tables downstairs. Every dish I've ordered has been delicious - I'm slowly working my way through the menu.  Did a take-out from here when I had some friends over - large portion sizes meant we had plenty of food, enough to satisfy three hungry people and still have left-overs."}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable delivery experience. There are at least a dozen Asian/noodle/fusion restaurants within 2 blocks of where I live, so you know the food at Sukhothai has to be something special for me to order from there.  Yes, we order the pad thai as well, but the star of the meal is always the curry. The people who answer the phone are very knowledgeable about the food, and are happy to talk you through their menu, so ask away.  A note of caution about ordering - typical delivery time is around an hour to 90 minutes. Can't be helped, given the size of the business and its popularity. DO ask at the end of the order how long it take, because your mileage may vary from mine.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed!  I have been eating here since it opened and today I ordered my usual tofu Khao Soi and it came with under cooked tofu, barely warm (I was there right as it came out of the kitchen) but worst of all with NO (zero) vegetables.  I called when I got home and noticed and they said the menu has changed and vegetables are now $3.50 extra.  They have not updated their website .. the person on the phone said they are not in charge of their website. WHAT?!  They said they would give me a free dish but only if I got it within 2 weeks BUT I am travelling and will be away which I told them and they said OH WELL.   What kind of customer service is this?  This place has gone down all the hills.  P.S. The shrimps chips were also over cooked almost burnt.  After 6 years of supporting and LOVING IT I won't be back.  And that hurts.  Has the ownership changed hands?  Have they overextended themselves?  I'm not sure but I am truly disappointed and not have lost a favourite restaurant."}
{"text":"The curry was good, but service was terrible. Waited about 30 minutes for the food to come out while I saw the tables both in front and behind me get served their entire meals before us. Very funny considering we sat down 10 minutes before either of them and ordered the same dish as one of them.   When I was ready to order, I tried flagging down the waiter but he ignored my initial attempt. Thankfully, one of the waitresses directed him to assist us.  Probably not coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"There is not much more I can add to the already raving reviews. This place is simple the best Thai take out place in the city.   I eat at this place on a regular for the last year or so and I've never been disappointed.   The Pad Kee Mao is out of this world! The Gaeng Garee is a must try. It's the best yellow curry I've ever tasted.  Khao Soi is excellent as well. I don't think there is anything bad here. I adore this place."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch with a reservation at 12:30pm. Ordered the Khao Soi which tasted great but had no time to enjoy it. The wait was 45 minutes for us. Hope they figure out a way to reduce wait times."}
{"text":"LOVE their SukhoThai Pad Thai... a bit pricy but great for those birthday/celebratory dinners."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!   Sukhothai pad thai: It tasted like regular pad thai. Meh.  Gaeng kiaw wan (Green curry): I had it with chicken. The flavors of the coconut and basil were rich and fresh and oh so wonderful!  Khao Soi: The broth was creamy, rich and flavorful, and the beef was so tender!  The only cons: It's really hard to call them for reservations or take out, and the cassava cake is always sold out."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5! Better than most Thai restaurants in the area but not as good as Khao San Road! The stir fry is average! I recommend the Sukho pad Thai and garlic tofu! Green curry is similar to KSR $$"}
{"text":"Had a great lunchtime meal.  The menu appears to be short but there is more than enough choices.  The food was very, very tasty and the service excellent.  Definitely adding to my lunch time choices."}
{"text":"Very good Thai restaurant, ranks among the top 10 in Toronto, always consistent and delicious. Personal favorite, the green curry and the mango salad."}
{"text":"So happy to have this new location open- my favourite thai food in the city! Their yellow curry is to die for."}
{"text":"Out of the way, but a gem amid many other non-descript places on the block. Pint size so go early for dinner as it can get. Freshly prepared from limited menu. You may want to ask them to spice things up a little once you get use to their Spice Rating system. Family run so good service. Encourage patrons who have visited Thailand to bring photos for their wall display."}
{"text":"We were a party of four. All of us had different meals and we all enjoyed them immensely. We went on a Saturday night, there was an excellent piano player giving great ambiance to the place. When he wasn't playing though, the music was a bit too loud for our taste. The service was not great but not bad either. Just average, a bit long but we were not in a hurry. I would definitely recommand."}
{"text":"Amazing thai food. However the food is not spicy even if you ask for thai spicy, which is their highest form of spicy. I was not the only one who thought that the food was not spicy enough. The place has limited seating so make sure you make reservations, otherwise you might be waiting a long time until you get seats. When you do get seats, it takes them a while to get you your food. It is not a wheel chair accessible for those interested in that information; it has about 4 steps to the sitting area.   The food is amazing though and worth the wait. I would recommend getting the beef in green curry; that dish is amazing.   The restaurant is not situated in the best of neighborhoods; beware of insane people that shout at you even after you give them money."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here tonight (on a Wednesday in cold February). We ordered the chicken pad Thai and the garlic beef with fried rice. We ordered mild but got hot sauce on the side - their hot sauce was super spicy, even for someone who likes a bit of spice. The food tasted delicious and arrived on time. The waiter was pleasant and checked in on us regularly. Got pretty noisy as the dinner rush began around 7pm (we came much earlier) but I guess that is something that comes with their popularity. I would expect lunch time to be more suitable for a small group outing.  Short walk from subway but a bit tricky to find. Great evening overall!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place and finally got there last weekend. I always had heard it was a dive but was pleasantly surprised to see that there are tables and its really quite nice inside. Staff seem to have a hard time managing the people waiting for tables and those coming in and ordering takeout. Ordered the Khao Soi and Penang Curry. Yum! Very impressed with how they pack your takeout - sauce is packed separately from noodles so limits potential for leakage! Now I have to go back to try the pad thai......"}
{"text":"We ordered take out and I was surprised how quickly they were able to have it ready considering it was lunch rush. We ordered chicken pad Thai and green curry chicken and everything is fantastic. It's all hot, fresh and flavourful. I highly recommend the green curry chicken. So yummy."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout through the maegan app from Sukho Thai.  Was able to pay & tip online.  Paid street parking available but you have to vie for spots w/cabbies as there's a taxi garage nearby.  Receptionist was none too friendly but perfunctory in her duties while the rest of the team seemed pleasant & busy packing up food & attending to customers.  Iced thai tea hit the spot!  Yum! Sukho pad thai was tasty but still a sweet vs savoury dish.  I wouldn't order the regular pad thai knowing that it is sweeter but I prefer my Thai food less sweet.  Portions were generous.  Will definitely go back to try a curry sometime; would be sooner if I knew whether or not they could accommodate my GF SO."}
{"text":"I came by after reading all the reviews here on Yelp.   I do have a disclaimer tho: having grown up on this type of cuisine, my taste buds are very particular to pick up the slightest divergence in seasoning.  I was a little confused at first since I wasn't sure whether we had to order at the counter or whether a person would come by to get our orders. After waiting for 10 min, I went up and asked if someone is going to take our order. Someone eventually did 5 min after that.  Starving, I ordered a (1) Sukho Pad Thai (some kind of special sauce) (2) Pad Sew   The food was decent though I felt the portions were a bit on the small side. I would do the upgrade to shrimp if there will be a next time (they looked better than the chicken / beef). The taste was good though I am not so sure if I like the special sauce all that much. I would try the traditional pad thai instead. I can be a traditionalist when it comes to comfort food - don't mix the formula if it is not required. As for the pad sew, I didn't really like the flavor. I feel as it is missing something ... the best ever was in a noodle shop in LA (thank goodness I am heading back in Nov). This one seems to be lacking tangy bite / sweetness to it. Not quite there.  Overall, a good experience but I am not sure I will walk the 20 min from Dundas Square the next time. And the service wasn't that great - very abrupt. The décor is very minimalistic."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. I've had the beef Khao Soi so many times, the beef is so tender and succulent, and the coconut gravy is smooth and creamy. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Perfect combination of very good food, smallish number of dishes, nice decor and friendly service. Dishes come in Thai-spicy, medium or mild. I've had the tofu Sukhothai Pad Thai (very generous portion and very good), the spring rolls (also good) and my favourite there so far, the Panang Curry with tofu, very light and perfectly seasoned. Yum. Oh yes, and the prices are very reasonable.  December 2016 update... Hadn't been back in two years and sooo looking forward to a good Pad Thai. What a disappointment. Medium spicy Pad Thai was dry as a bone and only tasted of whatever spice they put in plus cheap oil. Barely edible. Veggie spring rolls were still good. Want to give two stars max for the awful Pad Thai, so averaging with the tasty spring rolls, ok service, the previous five stars and a lot of  hope."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place and after having tried Khao San Road recently, I had to try it. The place was very small and narrow, service was very slow, and the food was average at best. I would probably go to KSR again, but not this one."}
{"text":"This is the place you should go if you are craving Thai food, i have been to Thailand so many time to eat just a PAD THAI. they have really friendly staff.great location and also good price.  Especially,sukho thai pad thai with shrimp is so yummy!! it actually taste better than one in thailand!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular but since this place change management it has gone down hill....I asked what plate was and he said that if could see the pic. The pics should tell what it is and I don't need to ask. Later I asked water ( as we were not even asked) and he throw two glasses on the table like he was mad for my request. When he brought the appetizers he didn't bring small plates. Again we  had to request them. He brought them all damp. In that point we didnt even told him. Pointless..   When we asked for the management to explain the bad service.  We were told it was the rude server. Not wonder why this place is so bad now!! He didn't apologizes for the bad experience and dared me to complain with the owner.  In summary an awful experience. Two starts for the guys on the kitchen who still try to make this place decent."}
{"text":"Started coming here 4 years ago when the ambience was like a grandma's kitchen. This have change with some upgrades to decor, franchising out but food is consistent. Prices have gone up and option in TO are plentiful. Padthai still great but the khao soi has become one noted. Curries are OK, but there are better places now. Hopefully, they maintain a niche again for me, but for now its still a decent place that I wish was the same as 4 years ago."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout. the lady warned me it would take 2 hours, which i was fine with. the food arrived on time and was great! the garlic shrimp were still crispy and totally delicious. the panag curry was flavorful and the pad kee mow was equally wonderful . I had specified spicy, and it wasnt an overpowering spiciness, it was just right.  all in all , great experience."}
{"text":"Food was okay - we had the pad thai and the khao soi. However I do think it's overrated and it seems like they were insanely unorganized: It was Friday lunch, we and some other customers have waited in the front door area while two waitresses passed by and gave us a \"just one minute\" gesture, one waiter wandering around aimlessly in front of us without paying any attention to us, two waiters chatting and giggling in front of the bar...and we've waited for a good 10-15 minutes when the restaurant was only about 60% full and visibly had many available seats! Food came very slowly...our entire meal lasted 1h 45 min and we simply ordered a pad thai and a khao soi! We've resisted the urge of not tipping at all and tipped a very small portion, hoping they would realize and make some improvements to this situation."}
{"text":"I was riding on the bus one day smelling a heavenly aroma (unexpected on public transort) so wonderful that I had to ask the lady where her food was from. She swore it was her and her children's favorite takeout in all of Toronto. So as an enterprising tourist, I made plans to eat there next day.  I can't describe the silky fragrant goodness of their green chicken curry. How refreshing to eat at a place that lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"It's pretty big in there. Green curry was no better or worse than anywhere else in town. The shrimp chips are awesome with tamarin sauce!"}
{"text":"The phad thai I had today was SO GOOD. I ordered a tofu/veg, no fish and no egg (vegan).   The only downside of this restaurant is the neighborhood. You may get murdered/robbed on your way to getting your phad thai but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I frequently try to make the trip downtown to eat here. I think that this is one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto.  My favourite dish here is the Gaeng Masaman and I tend to always order the Shrimp fresh rolls as an app. I think chicken goes well with the Gaeng Masaman, and I would recommend getting at least medium spicy level since the tamarind balances out with the spiciness.  I'm looking forward to my next trip here!"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I've had in or outside of Thailand  If you go for dinner be prepared for the people who order take out to sit on your table and in your food. Not the restaurants fault rude people eat here. The food is that good"}
{"text":"I first found about this place through a friend when I mentioned we were moving into the area and was excited to try it after hearing how amazing the food was and when I visited the website to read about the charming story about finding love and amazing food overseas then bringing it all back home to Canada, it peaked my interest to say the least.  After trying it for the first time, the food was indeed hands down the best pad thai I've had so far. Unfortunately, the service was absolutely awful. I figured it was busy so it was to be expected. I came back a few times afterward and each time there was *Always* an issue. Slow service, misunderstood orders, forgotten orders, and bringing out food so late that 10mins after my friends finished their food, mine finally came. Really embarrassing when you bring along friends after recommending it so highly.  Hearing reviews about how great the busy atmosphere is, I was surprised how tiny the place was and having being seated in a very depressing bottom floor (basement) that felt like someone's sad apartment, I noticed that everyone working there weren't even from thailand. Who cares right? No one can expect the owners to be there all the time but in every instance I've been there, I have *never* seen them - which leads me to believe that this story is either a sham or that this place is under new management with the same recipes.  Their lovely website frequently gets taken down and sometimes the only way to find out their contact information, is to do a google search and find a raving review (possibly from the golden ages of its existence). It's sadly turned into a place full of snippy disgruntled employees who seem to not care at all about the level of service, quality control, keeping up the raving reputation this place once had or even want to smile, look you in the eye, or sometimes even say thank you for that matter.   OK so dining in is probably not the way to go (even during non-peak hours) so let's eliminate the bad service and just focus on the food by simply ordering take-out. I guess they're trying to be as authentic to the heritage by adhering to their time zone because when we finally came to pick up the food at the time specified, we waited so long that it seemed that people who just came in and sat down got their food before ours. To top it all off we came home to realize that they gave us chicken vs beef pad thai (luckily I don't mind either) but the worst was finding peanuts a dish we specifically requested extra care be taken to because of a severe allergy. One epi pen later and a half-assed apology over the phone, we decided to never eat there again. Such a shame because the food is pretty good, cheap, and close by but sometimes I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"one of the nicest halal restaurants downtown - the space is great, the ambience is BUSY  - its always crowded. I would make reservations although they messed up ours but were accomodatinh.  I had the khao soi and it was delicious the first time. And it wasn't as great the second and third time. The Penang curry chicken is good but not memorable."}
{"text":"The Padthai is really good!! However, consistency is still the issue. The last time I ate the padthai, it was too sweet and plain. However, overall, it still the best pad thai I've ever had in Toronto"}
{"text":"This is a good spot. Quality thai dishes, decent prices. Predominately have curries and noodle dishes and the few times I've eaten there they've been all good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my recent visit here. This place is pretty huge and there wasn't a wait when I got here or throughout the night. The lighting in here isn't bright, but it's not that dim either. It's like American/Canadian restaurants with a bar inside. The chairs are comfy and the table space wasn't tiny. That's important to me because I often feel there isn't enough room when I'm at a 2 person table.   We ordered the fresh spring rolls and it did not really taste thai like. That is up to you if it bothers your or not. The vegetables were extremely fresh. You could tell by the crispness and bright color. It cleared my palette to prepare for my entree.   I order the guaytiaw sukhothai - which is a soup noodle. There was A LOT of meat - which I appreciated. It's a plain soup noodle with some unknown ingredient to give it a kicking flavor. I don't usually cook thai so I am unsure what it is! It's similar to tom yum soup without the spiciness. Oh and I ordered this non-spicy. It was delicious except it felt like it was missing something. I think the missing thing was just the spiciness. I'm sure if I ordered it with some level of spiciness it be perfect.   Lastly I'd like to say the service was pretty super! It got really busy after we got in but our waiter was super nice! We told him in the beginning we would like to order something to-go later on and he remembered that later on and came to check-in about it."}
{"text":"Really good thai food in a small, popular spot.  Four of us all very happy with what we ordered, all different items.  Service was a bit slow but very friendly so forgivable for a busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"Went on a very busy cold Friday night.  The place was packed.   The Sukho Pad thai was excellent.    I will return on a less crowded weekday."}
{"text":"Ofc the place lives up to its name. Absolutely Love the tom kha gai,  khao soi and the pad Thai.. Don't think there's any place that does khao soi like sukho Thai!  The pad see eew is also quite good"}
{"text":"This has become my favourite local take out place, so rich and delicious, I often find myself craving it!   Expect to wait 35-40 minutes (I call and order in advance), but this is because they make everything fresh!  My new favourite dish is the Khao Soi, by far the BEST Thai food I've ever eaten. If you order it mild, even those who don't like spicy heat, would enjoy this dish. Rich, full of texture, and if you order the beef - huge, tender chunks of braised goodness."}
{"text":"Great Food.  We ordered the Khao Soi with Tofu, Gaeng Garee with Chicken, the Tom Yum Kung soup (which was actually very spicy and we like spice), and an order of fresh shrimp rolls. The food was fantastic and full of flavour. Very filling and creamy dishes. My only con was the peanut sauce that came with my fresh rolls was rather chunky and not the creamy consistency that i enjoy when dipping fresh rolls. Other then that a great place to order in from!"}
{"text":"Food here is brilliant.  It was a very cold and snowy night and we were in town for a visit. The place we were staying recommended this place so thought we would give it a try.   So what to say, the food was really good, having spent time in Thailand I am a bit more fussy about what passes as proper Thai food and this place really delivered, one of the best Pad Thais I've had in ages, also the portions were generous, which for me is also useful.  Just one word of warning - they are generous with the spices, maybe knock it down a notch fro your usual level when they ask how spicy you want it"}
{"text":"This past March I spent four weeks backpacking around Thailand. A highlight of my time there was the week I spent in the small and out of the way town in the hills, Pai. The food there was the best in all the country (better than Chiang Mai, even): cheap, flavourful, and to my tastebuds, authentic (no ketchup or other western flavourings!). Imagine my immense delight when I realized that the family of the Curry Shack in that idyllic town operated a Thai restaurant here in my own neighbourhood.  SO HAPPY!  Tonight I ordered from them for the first time. Even though they were busy, I had piping hot food at my door within the hour. I ordered Pad Kee Mao with chicken, and my cousin the Sukhothai Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. I make a pretty mean PKM, so Im used to how I make it, so I wasnt over the top thrilled with my dish, but my cousin's was out of this world. Simply extraordinary.  In addition, we ordered the shrimp rolls (deep friend yumminess) and shrimp chips. Our entrees were large enough though that we didnt really need the appetizer.  I will 100% order from them again, and look forward to making my way through their menu."}
{"text":"Wow.  What to say about the disappointing dinner at Sukho Thai.  It's like being a kid and seeing a present shaped like a guitar that you've been coveting under the tree, to only find upon opening that it's your grandmother's hand-me-down robe.  It's really that disappointing.     When its extremely crowded upstairs, they have creepy seating downstairs in the basement.  Great.  The menu is extremely limited.  You have two noodle dishes, four curries and two random entrees to choose from.    I ordered the Sukho Pad Thai (when I asked why it was different than regular Pad Thai, I was told there were \"special spices\", peanuts and lime mixed in.  Sounds like normal Pad Thai to me...) combo meal.  This was supposed to come with a salad and drink.  When I asked if vegetables could be mixed in (fiber please?), I was told they didn't have any.  *sigh*  My husband ordered the beef entree that came with jasmin rice as a combo as well.    The salad was julienned mango, cucumber and peppers in rice wine vinegar in the smallest bowl i've ever seen.    When our entrees came out, we were starving.  The \"special spices\" on my Pad Thai was lots of salt...and something funky.  My husband's beef was also pretty salty.  His came with an egg that looked like it was fried last week.  We ate as much as possible to avoid passing out in Regent Park, asked for it to go and left.  We trashed it once we realized even a bum wouldn't go there.    I haven't tried the curries.  They could be the mind blowing and totally authentic somewhere in Thailand, but don't expect Bangkok.  You'll probably get Chiang Mai.  With that said, our search for our favorite Thai restaurant continues...."}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely the best Thai take out I've found in Toronto, and trust me, that's a lot of trying! I always order vegetarian dishes and they are always flavourful and fresh.  The curries especially are awesome."}
{"text":"This is my first Thai restaurant in Toronto but I think it's setting the bar really high for others to beat.  The Khao Soi is a yellow egg noodle in a creamy curry broth. It's very flavorful, rich in coconut and hot curry. It's well balanced. The coconut didn't over power the curry flavor. It had a small teaspoonful of hot red chili oil on top. Make sure you mix it well with the noodle and broth. It gives it the right amount of kick to the flavor. It's perfection.  The Sukho Thai Pad Thai is very authentic. It has a sweet base flavor from the tamarind sauce. It's not sour like the common \"Ketchup-ish\" Pad Thai you'd get elsewhere. Sprinkle the roasted peanut on top to round out all the flavor. Don't skip it unless you're allergic to peanut. We ordered chicken with it and we get generous amount of chunky tender chicken. The chicken is slightly just a tad less juicy than I'd like but it's by far the best chicken Pad Thai in GTA.  Oh the green curry! Creamy oh so creamy coconutty green curry! Need I say more? Surprisingly the coconut, bamboo shoot, bell pepper, and curry flavor are all well balanced. Individual flavor comes out progressively in my mouth and also burst out happily together.  Love it! If I have a XXL stomach, I'd have tried out all the curry.  I round out tonight with the Thai ice tea and cassava cake.  In my humble opinion, the chef put a lot of thought into the menu. The choir on the menu is limited but each dish is prepared and crafted with love and sincerity.  If I were to nitpick a little bit, they could improve a little bit at seating people and handling the line of people waiting for table. All the people picking up take-out, paying for take-out, waiting for table and paying for the dinner are all on the same line. This makes for quite a hectic dining experience for an otherwise perfecto dinner."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai was great at accommodating my gluten free diet. The waiter was kind enough to tell me which items I could eat on the menu, and the dishes they could modify to be gluten free.  We had the Fresh Spring Rolls, Pad Thai, and Green Curry. Everything was delicious! I would probably ask for things to be a tad spicier next time around though.  I shall return!"}
{"text":"Food: 4   Service: 3.5  Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.8 / 5  I've been to this Suko Thai location twice - once with a friend and another time for a birthday with a group of 10. As other Yelpers have already mentioned, this restaurant is owned by the same people who opened Khao San Road.  My main reason for going here instead of Khao San at times is to avoid the 15-45 min wait. As far as I can tell, most of the food is basically the same with a few variations here and there.   First thing I noticed when I walked in was that the location is definitely better for bigger groups. I found the lighting too dim but that can be said about so many restaurants. I only ever order the Beef Khao Soi which is my absolute favourite Thai comfort food -- Pad thai doesn't even come close for me. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the creamy coconut curry was the perfect canvas for all the complicated Thai flavours that usually go in this dish. Most of the people in my party of 10 enjoyed their food. Some thought that their rice dishes were not as good as the pad thai or Khao Soi and that their Thai Iced Tea was too sweet.   Overall, the food was good, their service could have been better (the waiter had difficulty attending to us as I think they were short-staffed that night) and they could definitely improve their lighting (or add more candles to their tables).  I give this place a 3.8/5 - great place to take friends/family who have never tried authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Food was great, we ordered the Khao Soi and Pad Thai in lunch portions and we wanted more of it.   It is quite busy during lunch hours but it's good that they do take reservations (unlike Khao San Road)."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've had (and I, like many, have been to Thailand as well as other Thai places in the city). My favourite is the Tom Yum (mild is HOT!) soup and then Panaeng curry. I can't say I've tried many dishes because I keep going back to my favourites. I've also tried the Pad Thai, crispy spring rolls, Tom Kha and Gaeng Masaman (only dish I would avoid, too sweet). Prices are pretty decent. Good size helpings. Everyone I've taken here loves it as well."}
{"text":"I really don't think Sukho Thai needs me to write another complimentary review since it's pretty obvious that this place is super awesome, but my dinner was so awesome that I can't help to write something really nice here.   I had the spicy Thai noodles, the one with basil, sorry I can't remember the name, it's the one that's below phad thai on the menu, seriously, it's the best thai basil noodles i had in Toronto. I once told my friends that I don't know how I can survive without Salad king's thai basil noodles, but I know how! Sukho's thai basil noodles is a lot more flavorful than Salad king's.   Phad Thai is great, best Phad thai ever, most Phad Thai i had at other places were too sweet and too sour, Sukho's sweet and sour flavour is just right amount, and the noodles were soft but still chewy enough.   Panang curry, oh gosh, where do I start with this one, I only had one bite (was my friend's dish), but this totally changed my opinion about curry, I think I like curry now, I never liked curry before.   They only had the coconut tapioca today, and it's good as usual, very rich but not too sweet. I also liked the shrimp chips, $2.50 for a whole plate, you can't go wrong with that.   Service was good, our waitress was very busy but she did a good job handling the whole basement area. The washroom floor was sticky, and this is the only thing that annoyed me a little, but really, with the amazing taste of the food, I really don't care about anything else.   I'm so grateful that my best friend just moved to Parliament and Dundas, so I can visit Sukho all the time!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is so good! I like that they give you peanuts on the side so that you can control how much gets put on your food. The taste of the food is always consistent.  The price has increased a fair bit since my last visit though."}
{"text":"Delicious food every time. Great menu, good prices. Halal too. Love the pad thai and curries."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. We got take out last night and everything was still really hot when we brought it home. Portions were large, food was flavourful, and everything tasted fresh. Gluten free oprtions!"}
{"text":"First of all, the ambiance is really nice. It gives you a very nice first impression. Nice decor and service is really good! If you like Thai Food, it's a 5 star restaurant!  Very friendly staff! Two thumbs up and yesss, food is awesome though I don't like Thai Food!  Imagine!?"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out after the reno. It's still small, even after pushing the kitchen back. One wall needs some decor. The service is good. Their pad thai is amazing. But no cassava cake to try. Second time already. They really need to make more of this."}
{"text":"The was my second visit in the past year.  Came here on a Friday night, and it was pretty busy (waited about 15 minutes to be seated).  I tried calling earlier in the day to make a reservation, but they said it was first come first serve only, and that the wait was about 15 minutes.  I actually wanted to go to Khao San Road, but when I called them, they said the wait was 45-60 minutes, so I decided against it.  I'm glad I came back to Sukho Thai.  ORDERED:  Spring Rolls:  Comes in an order of 3.    These spring rolls were good.  But then again, its hard to get this dish wrong.  Shrimp Chips with Tamarind Dip:   Order this dish.  Its $2.50 for a huge plate of these chips.  Really fresh with a subtle shrimp flavour.  10 times better than the normal Chinese shrimp chips.  I didn't like the Tamarind Dip though.  Khao Soi:  This is my favorite dish.  You dunk the crispy noodles in the sauce and let it settle for a few minutes, then enjoy the soft/crispy texture in a rich creamy curry sauce.  Note that this dish is very rich, my dinning partner could not take more than a few spoonfuls before tapping out.  Gaeng Phed and Gaeng Panang:   Soft, tender meat and a nice curry sauce.  No complaints.    This restaurant is pretty small, I'm guessing they can only seat around 30 people (15 on the main level, and 15 in the basement).  They seem to do alot of take-out.  Know that I'm not an expert in Thai food by any means.  Also, if it makes a difference, the cooks/servers are Philippino, not Thai.    Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Came on a weekday night for dinner with my hubby and the food was delicious. I got the Guay Kow Suhkothai (rice noodle soup with beef in it) and he got the Pad Thai Sukhothai.   The  beef noodle soup had a generous amount of beef in it, I honestly didn't think I would be full when I ordered it and was going to order more food if that was the case, however I was full because of the generous amount of tender beef in the soup. I got it medium spicy and it had a great kick while not masking flavor. I got the combo meal so it came with a can of soda and a small serving of mango salad which was refreshing.   I tried my hubby's pad thai and was pleased that it was cooked with tamarind and not ketchup. It was very flavorful, but a bit \"one note\", the tamarind was a bit heavy handed and while the initial few bites were tasty, my hubby found it monotonous and overpowering half way through, I think in the future we will share this dish so one person does not have to eat it all. The waiter carried curries for other tables and judging from the scent and look they seem great so I am going to try those in the future.  The space is small and they have a lot of foot traffic from a steady take out crowd. There are additional tables in the basement, the street level where we dined only have about 6 tables. We biked there and there was no bike rings around, so we locked our bikes by Freshco one street up.  Edit: Went again tonight (weekend) and the suhkothai pad thai was EXCELLENT, it was well balanced and complex and the tamarind was not over powering today , love the thai leeks they added to it (not present the first time we had it). Different chef? Also tried the massaman beef curry and the red curry spicy and both were good but the massaman was better than the red."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service and the food came out very quickly. It was easy to street park near the restaurant. Highly recommend sukho pad thai and garlic beef. I also really enjoyed thai iced tea. I only took off one star because of the lack of 2-people tables. I thought it was a waste of space to put two people in a 4-people table especially because I had to wait for a table to open up. Other than that, really enjoyed my experience here"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! We arrived around 8pm on a Friday evening. We waited about 30 mins for a table - but left and came back after getting a drink down the street. The service was quick and friendly and food was awesome!! Loud and fun atmosphere. Definitely a great place for Thai!"}
{"text":"I have been to sukho thai at least 40 times by now, so its about time I write a review! It is absolutely the best thai food in Toronto! I have brought everyone here (coworkers, family, friends), and they all love it and have become regulars! I've tasted almost everything on the menu, its all amazing, but my favourites are their spring rolls, the tom kha gai soup (I usually order this with rice as my main course, its the most delicious soup!), the sukhothai pad thai (i like it with shrimp) and the panang curry (with chicken).. but everything here really is delicious and authentic (other favs include garlic chicken, masaman curry, and my bf loves their khao soi). Their dishes are always consistent, their portions are huge, their prices are very reasonable and they also deliver!"}
{"text":"Sukho Thai just made us wait almost 90 minutes for our delivery order before calling to inform us that they we're outside the delivery area. I spoke to two employees and they were completely unwilling to do the right thing.  This is not how you run a business, folks!"}
{"text":"Sukho Thai is a tiny restaurant, in a questionable neighbourhood, that always has a lineup spilling onto the street. It serves authentic, delicious Northern Thai Cuisine. The owners are a husband and wife couple. He is Canadian, and met and married a Thai women who ran a Curry restaurant with her family in the sleepy town of Pai, in North Thailand. (North of Chang Mai.)   Having lived briefly in Thailand, there are a number of things that bring me back in an instant. Gaeng Masaman and Gaeng Penang are two of them. These are the less popular curry styles, that are just not to be found on menus in Toronto. Penang has bite provided by Kaffir Lime Leaves, and Masaman has a Tamarind, Peanut and Potato Sauce. Both make me terrifically happy. My favorite part is that if you order spicy, you get spicy.  Ka! Spicy Ka!  The spring rolls here are ridiculously flavourful, and handmade.   I have never found a time where there is not a huge lineup. They have recently opened the downstairs with a limited amount of seating, but no windows, to help with the overflow. Go to the cash to pay, they take all methods of payment.  The service tends to be authentically Thai as well at times. Food comes out when it is ready, not when your order is all complete. Sometimes you have to wave your servers over, sometimes they forget things.  Be Patient. Its Thai Time.  I would dock them a half a star for not having reusable chopsticks, but I noticed most people around me were using cutlery anyways. And the food is so authentically Thai it warms my heart.   Sap Sap Aroy Dee!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto*.   The place itself is not welcoming. It's tiny with modest furnitures and tacky wall decor. Blaring music from a boombox accentuates the chaos in the open kitchen.    The food, however, is a different story.  The Tom Yung Goong is the tastiest one I've had; it's thick, sweet and has rich fusion of exotic flavours with large chunks of tomatoes and mushroom and fresh, medium-sized shrimps.    Don't be put off with the dull, brownish sukho pad thai (sans the catsup)- The noodles are slightly oiled and not dry and has a fine balance of sweet and spice.  We usually have either the panang beef or other curries. All of which are satisfactory.  The cassava cake is usually good, especially when it's warm and freshly made. Not consistent, though.  I also recommend the garlicky fried rice, generously served with slivered chicken.  Getting parking around the place is challenging that's why we usually pick up or order a delivery (plan 1 hour in advance though so you don't get too hungry waiting).    (*My previous favorite, the Lao-Thai Van Vanipha around Kensington has long shuts its doors unexpectedly much to my dismay.)"}
{"text":"Ordered from uber eats. They took over an hour to make my food before the driver could even pick it up. I have so many regrets ordering from here. The calamari is good, but not a big portion AT ALL. The container is small and filled halfway with chips. I really hated the pad Thai, despite it being one of my favourite foods. Not sure what all the fuss is about, to be perfectly honest."}
{"text":"Suko thai is probably one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto.  It is not a high end place, but the food is authentic and flavorful, which is what Thai food should be.  My favorite is the coconut soup and panang chicken.  The kao sai is also great.  Anything on the menu is wonderful.  Also the staff here are amazing, very nice, seems like a family run restaurant.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The khao soi here and at Pai tastes the closest to what I had while I was in Thailand and brings back memories every time! Sometimes I switch it up and order the pad thai if I want something lighter.  I personally find Pai and Sukhothai to be on par in terms of taste and portion for their khao soi. I just end up going to Sukho Thai more often since it's closer to my office."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  I have not had better Pad Khe Mao anywhere.  Their beef Gan Penang is to out of this world and highly addictive. Sukhothai Padthai Unbeatable.  People are complaining about post renovation Sukhothai, I disagree, place is still fantastic.  Most other thai places in the GTA do not even come close."}
{"text":"Food well above average yet, hard not to note the acknowledgement of poor service superceding the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"finally some better Thai in Toronto. the tom yum soup was awesome (it's a bit spicy but the flavour is amazing and is highly addictive) and the curries are much better than the usual Thai curries in the city, with a lot more depth.  service was a bit slow the day I went but maybe it was just a coincidence"}
{"text":"My go to place for Thai Food. While I am across from their sister company, Khao San Road, I just find the food to be better. A bit of a sketch area, but it's easy to get on their waitlist (queue for 30-45 mins on Friday night), go down to the distillery district for a drink or two, and then come back up!"}
{"text":"I recently moved away from the St. Lawrence Market and the one thing I miss the most (besides the market, of course) is Sukho Thai. I've ordered their Sukho Thai Pad Thai an embarrassing amount of times - hands down the best pad thai in the city. I don't even bother trying it anywhere else (with a few exceptions: Khao San Road and Pai) because nothing compares. The portion size is very generous so I usually take my leftovers home... and finish it an hour later."}
{"text":"Tried out Sukho Thai after frequent visits to Khao San Road and Pai and wanted to compare the quality.  Great space with large open windows that make it perfect during the summertime. The Thai iced tea was very good but have to say that the gaeng garee yellow curry chicken was amazing! Well flavoured and balanced between the curry spice and the coconut milk, I devoured it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Probably my favorite Thai food in the city, good service and awesome vegan options."}
{"text":"ARROGANT......... This afternoon i went to the restaurant around 1.30 pm..restaurant had 8 tables vacant with patrons leaving after lunch. I was single was told that as they did not have a \"deuce\" they could not seat me and that I had to eat at the bar or wait for 1/2 hour..........really! You are so ARROGANT that in-spite of having tables available you treat your single customer in this manner especially someo"}
{"text":"The Sukhothai Pad Thai was really good. I would have preferred it to be a little more saucy, but that's just personal preference. Also got the Thai Iced Tea, excellent! The perfect blend of tea and sweetness.  There was about 3 tables occupied when my party came in. The shop fills up pretty quickly. Service was good."}
{"text":"Find this hole in the wall and go there. You won't regret it. We made last-minute reservations for dinner that afternoon and just barely snuck in for an early bite.  Seating is comfortable enough, the atmosphere of the place straddles something between a restaurant and a takeout joint (though, doesn't every Asian restaurant?!), but it doesn't matter. Starting with the too-cheap-to-be-true shrimp chips and moving on to two wham-bam thank-you-Siam noodle and curry dishes, my dining partner and I were blown away.  Undoubtedly some of the best Thai food in the city."}
{"text":"Recently ordered green curry with chicken. If you are hungry I suggest you requesting MORE rice. They literally give you two spoons of rice (take out). Ridiculous. Rice is the cheapest ingredient in your menu, please be more generous Suko management."}
{"text":"Did take out here. Food was ready before I got there - exactly in the 20 minutes.   Pad Thai was very good as were the spring rolls and curry flavoured chocked dish.   Food: 4/5 Ambiance - didn't dine in so I'll skip this  Service - didn't dine in  Food to Price Value: 4/5"}
{"text":"Usually always do delivery through ubereats.  They used to be on their game and i always was happy.  That qualified them for a dedicated customer and about 13 uber eats orders in the last 6 months at 50 to 60 bucks each.   Lately as of the last 2 orders they have consistently been late with food and had to microwave it due to temp.  Today is probably the last time i order and put this place to bed.  1 hour late for food... and so bland!  Red curry tastes like water.. and even consistency is water... pad thai order with hardly no chicken and mostly noodles... jeez.  Way to flush $60 down the drain!  Its been a ride but you guys are on the slide and i aint going down with the ship!"}
{"text":"We've been both to the restaurant and have ordered from it using ubereats, It's got very tasty food. We've ordered the green curry, the khao soi and one of the pad thais. The green curry was pretty creamy but would have been better with a bit more coconut flavour but the meat in this dish was generous. The Khao soi is very pleasant. The portions are very generous. The restaurant seemed pretty big and able to accommodate larger parties. The service was decent but no extra flare/attentiveness."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on our anniversary - we are low key people who enjoy a good meal and we definitely got it there. So delicious! I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I went to the Parliament old store and was directed to the new location.  Surprisingly the décor is so much different than the previous location.  It is modern, yuppie like with comfortable seats.  Brick walls to retain a feel of the historic old days.  I can see that it can be competitive in the downtown core.  We lined up and was asked to wait for 20 to 30 minutes and advised to go out for a walk with -4C.  Not a very good suggestion! We waited a while and decided to leave by the time the waiter had come to us that there was a cancellation, so we had our table instantly.  The environment definitely worth the wait.    We order the Shrimp Spring Rolls - vegetarian rolls with shrimp, glass noodles, mushrooms, carrots and beansprouts.  Though it is not wrapped tightly but it tastes very fresh.  I love the peanut butter sauce on the side.  Next is the Guaytiaw Sukhothai - a Northern Thai version of the Guaytiaw, it is totally different from the Cantonese Guaytiaw.   I found it not much special than a beef Guaytiaw noodle soup.  Then comes the Sukhothai Pad Thai.  I highly expect this one as I found it to be one of the best in town at both KSR and this previous store location.  It is just too wet and sticky for the Pad Thai.  What a disappointment.  KSR is so much better.  The last is the Chicken Gaeng Garee - Yellow curry with potatoes and coconut milk.  The curry is yummy.  If I am not full, I will order more rice to consume the curry.  The  Cassava Cake  dessert made from cassava mixed with coconut strips and coconut milk is divine.  But I got a feeling that it went into the microwave a bit too long that the cohesive texture is destroyed and is too soft.  For the decor here is the place.  For the food, I still remember the old days at Parliament. As for the service, we miss one set of cutlery and has to remind a few times before it is being given.  No matter why the ratings is lower than before!"}
{"text":"Finally after reading so many reviews about it, we come to try it out.  From the outside look, if it is not with the address, I will surely miss it while passing by.  The store is a very narrow building.  Once you walk it, there are a few tables along the wall.  There are tables in the basement as well.  The order counter is at the end of the hallway.  I can see there are many take-outs to be picked up.     We order the special SukoThai Pad Thai with shrimp, Gaeng Garee (Yellow curry) with chicken and Cassava Cake.  The Pad Thai is very good though personally I like the Pad Thai at Khao San Road a bit more.  The potatoes in the curry are yummy.   The potatoes actually take over the chicken as the focus.  The dessert cake is made from cassava, coconut milk and coconut strips.   The coconut strips add the chewy feeling.  The dessert is sort of like sticky rice with a special taste from cassava.  Although the food price is a bit cheaper than Khao San Road, I like the environment better in Khao San Road.  The service in the restaurant is a bit slow. It may be due to long line up of take out customers"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing thai food and absolutely appalling service.  Do not try between 12 and 2pm if you're trying to have a 1 hour lunch.  4 people waited 45 minutes for food.  If you go, go off peak hours."}
{"text":"Menu have very few selections, though what we tried was actually good though a somewhat overpriced.  However, they don't even have coconut rice.  We were waiting for a long time at the door before someone bothered to welcome us.  Our server was very friendly, but the service in terms of getting the food to our table promptly was quite poor.  Half the table finished their meal before the other half got their food.  Appetizers came last, ironically."}
{"text":"We stopped to check this place out because it looked so cool and lively from the street. We were instantly greeted by the manager and promised a table in 15 minutes on a busy Saturday night. We were seated within 5. Love it, under promise and over delivered.  We ordered crispy spring rolls, beef khai soy and chicken pad thai. Within minutes we realized that we were eating in one of Jeff's restaurants. He bought Thai food cooking and authentic eating from Thailand to Toronto. This is the real stuff!!!! We usually go to Pai on Duncan and Jeff always finds us a table in his signature restaurant where getting a table is near impossible and making a reservation is usually 3 weeks out.  Check this place out or one of his other restaurants. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has good food but appalling service. At the end of our meal, the server basically put the card machine up to my face when I was occupied with something. I asked him if it would be ok for me to pay within a minute so I could just finish what I was reading. His response to that was to slam the card reader on the table. I decided I wanted to pay immediately so told him I was ready (he was attending to the table next to us and was standing there anyway) and because of the attitude he kept giving, I decided to not tip. He responded by slamming the machine on the table again, followed by doing the same with my receipt. The time between that and going to go speak to the manager was extremely uncomfortable as he kept looking at us weird. Both my friend and I were at a loss for words.   Initially I was intending on coming back here and I hate to say it, but never again."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars to anything, but this DEFINITELY deserves it! First and foremost, it is HALAL! hurrahh!!   The menu: Limited, yet they have perfected every plate they serve and I think that is the most important part. We get the Sukhothai Phad Thai every single time and never regret it. The garlic chicken appetizer is unreal...just...mouth watering. The spring rolls are deelish.   Prices: Veryyy reasonable  Size: Place is definitely small, but I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a spot.  Service: Friendly service, incredibly fast! You order and the plate appears in front of you just a few minutes later. I guess that's the plus of having a short menu :)  Parking: Street parking, can be annoying but worth the aggravation lol  Cleanliness: clean store, plates, glasses and cutlery. Never had a problem here. Even their washroom is relatively clean.  Definitely try this cute hidden gym out, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Usually I never write reviews, but I was greatly disappointed with the ten minutes I stood in this restaurant.   We came in with a large party of 15 people, with reservations made, for a surprise birthday party. We were informed over the phone that individual bills will not be provided but we still went with the reservation. Although we were looking for a 6:30pm reservation we had to cope for the 6:00pm, and only 10 minutes were allotted to reservation holds. We made sure 80% of our guests got there on time and the rest were on their way, by 6:20 our tables were given away despite the fact that other tables were available. With only the birthday boy and two friends missing as this was according to plan, we asked to get our table back and an extra chair as we received three extra guests. The manager was extremely rude about accommodating to our guests and was going about losing the opportunity to other customers he had to serve. At the end we chose to walk out, which surprisingly got the manager fist pumping with joy.   We might not be your average Bay Street professionals as we're all university students, but all of us clearly understand the logistics of customer care and we certainly felt assaulted with the rude and disrespect we received as being guests.   I personally felt that we were accommodating to the restaurant's needs instead of the other way around."}
{"text":"After many disastrous experiences with Thai food in Toronto, I have finally found a restaurant that I'd like to experience again.  I'll even going to go out on a limb and say that the Sukho Thai experience is much better than that of Khao San Road (which I gave a one star review). Sukho don't try to pack so many people in that you can't move, they don't make people wait outside, there's no \"well we're Khao San Road\" attitude, and when you order take-out, it's quick and efficient. Even getting reservations and a table (without reservations) seems to be easy and painless (for the couple of times we've tried).  There is nothing pretentious or snobby about the restaurant. Like another reviewer mentioned, the atmosphere is not as trendy as some places (it's almost pub like), but at least you can get a seat, good service, and great food.   The Khao Soi is one of the best I've experienced. The beef is tender, the curry has just the right amount of heat (and if you want \"thai\" level of hotness, they give you chilli paste to go with your dish), and the portions are well sized.  Thanks for changing my opinion of the Thai food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Halal Thai, please be mine.  I got a chicken pad thai, but we also ordered a coconut thai curry and a green curry. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food.  Even the leftovers tasted amazing!  This place is really small and is often jam packed (and loud), and if you aren't looking for it, you will walk right past it.  The food was overpriced, but portion sizes were ample. Still a place I'll visit again once I'm back in TO."}
{"text":"This place is pretty packed, so perhaps plan ahead or call in before making the trip. Also, the prices are rather steep for what you get.  I had the Sukho Thai Pad Thai with chicken, and my friends had a white and green curry which both came with rice. Silly me didn't try either of their dishes, but they seemed happy with their choices.  The Pad Thai was was okay, rather standard from what you'd get anywhere in the states, there definitely seemed to be some flavor component missing that I just can't put my finger on.  Nonetheless, I'll probably try something else from their menu if I'm in the area, but this didn't seem the place to me to go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Wellington location review:  The food, and the green curry chicken in particular, is amazing! Some of the best Thai food I've ever had. The service, however, has been bad on occasion and is never all that good at the best of times, which is why it only gets four stars.  Service complaints include ridiculously long waits (and watching all the tables around us get their food before us, even when they arrived after us), dirty utensils, waiters who never come by to follow up or provide the bill, and finally, their refusal to answer the phone so that take out orders can be placed. Every time I've tried calling lately I've been unable to get through. The guy who seats people is really nice and seems to care, but the wait staff could definitely use a lesson in customer service.  At the end of the day I keep going back because the food is that good."}
{"text":"i used to visit this place often when i lived closer a few years ago and the food was always really good. it was my first \"real\" thai food experience. since then i've eaten at or ordered takeout from the wellington location (they don't deliver) - the food is consistently delicious.   yesterday i decided to order delivery from this location through uberEats and the food arrived quickly and was super hot which was great. i ordered green curry and pad thai (my faves!!), however, they got my order wrong: veggie pad thai instead of tofu pad thai - served me large cruciferous vegetables on top of a cake of oily-but-dry noodles and the green curry was inedible due to the thick layer of oil sitting on top from the time it arrived, thin and oily and majorly lacking flavour. couldn't stomach it. hugely disappointed.   the meals aren't cheap but i won't complain about the price because when it's good it's great and worth it. uberEats refunded my order, great service, very grateful to them for that but i won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Always loved the food but oh boy! Went to pickup after said time and stood there with a bunch of other very irritated folks while waitresses and waiters complained and swore as they walked by.  Ended up getting a refund because I had to go.  A refund that was not graciously given.  Why not just tell me it's going to be an hour guys?"}
{"text":"Good authentic Thai food.  Place is more of a cafe than a restaurant and service is sincere but haphazard.  It's not in the nicest of neighbourhoods, so I'd suggest getting a cab after dark.  Food all served at once, which made for a fairly hectic meal.  My colleague and i enjoyed it, although it would have been nice to have washed it down with an alcoholic drink.  They are not licenced for sales of alcohol.  All in all, a good Thai cafe which is great value for money.  $40 cad inc a generous tip for two."}
{"text":"Thai food amateur reporting in.  Experience consists of Thai Fusion, Thai to Go, and other grab and go or imitation styles (Spring Rolls).    This is the best and most authentic Thai restaurant I've ever been to.  Parking is found on the street or in the school parking lot across the store.  Neighbourhood is safe - there is some construction at the moment but a taxi dispatch centre (24hrs) and a cultural supermarket nearby.  This place is well lit and popular enough to attract hipsters/couples/city officials.    I had spring rolls (appetizer ~$4), Sukhothai (main dish ~$11), Gaeng Masaman (main dish ~$8), and a coconut pudding cake ($3.5), totaling ~$35 for two.    -The three spring rolls came out fairly quickly, but I didn't find anything  special about them.  It was left whole (not cut in the middle).  -Sukhothai is a flat noodle dish with a distinct flavour of spiciness and sweet lime.  You choose a meat complement of beef or chicken (or shrimp +$1).  - Gaeng Masaman is a curry that comes with a bowl of white rice.  The curry is nutty and light.  You choose a meat complement of beef or chicken (or shrimp +$1).  - Coconut cake is fresh.   Staff are courteous and do the best they can manage.  They do take-out and the seating could be awkward and spoil your date.  However, I recommend you come here for the quality of food they offer."}
{"text":"love it and the only thing I don't like about them is they are not located closer to my area ... now this is what I consider great take-out if this place was on my way home it would just be amazing they need to open a location in Corktown"}
{"text":"Customer service was great. They were very attentive and friendly Bonus: I was able to watch raptors and cavs play. That being said it can get a little noisy in there  We ordered 6 dishes. My favorite was the khan soi with beef. It has  a sweet coconutty and spicy flavour, perfect combination. You can't go to an Asian restaurant without ordering fried rice and Thai fried rice with shrimp didn't disappoint. Panang salmon was a little over cook. It was dry but the sauce made up with the dryness of the fish. Veggie rolls was surprisingly good. Veggies were definitely fresh and the peanut paste complimented it well. Chicken satay skewer were tender and tasty."}
{"text":"The Thai food here is very fresh and flavorful. We started with the vegetarian spring rolls. They were crisp and tasty and were not overwhelmingly greasy like spring rolls at most restaurants. Our table split the special pad Thai and the vegetable Penang curry. Both were good but my favorite was the pad Thai. I'm not a huge pad thai fan but it tasted great and packed a punch. The highlight of my meal was definitely the cassava cake. I'd never had it before and it was so soft and gooey and sticky and the top was lightly caramelized. It was so good. It is quite rich and decadent and sharing it amongst three of us was a good idea."}
{"text":"Really really ridiculously good thai take-out.  My bf brought home the special pad thai and green curry with chicken for dinner this week. Scored a few brownie points with that one.   Curry was not at all greasy and had a great amount of spice. The 'special' pad thai was quite special - nothing ketchupy about it (I like ketchup but not in my thai food). So flavourful. Hearty portion - more than enough for 2.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just like in thailand;) the curry is very creamy... They offer thai spicy which means just like thai locals love it... The service is fast... All in all a very good culinary experience;)"}
{"text":"Came here after a wine event. I ordered a coconut soup with chicken and it came with rice. I got it medium spicy and it wasn't' spicy at all; same thing with a companion's medium spicy dish. Another companion's \"spicy\" dish was too spicy, \"spicy\" was the next level up from \"medium\", so I think this restaurant is pretty inconsistent with its spicy levels. I expected the coconut soup to be somewhat creamy, but it wasn't, it was soupy (ie. watery). I guess I should have ordered a \"curry\" if I wanted something creamy.   If you want good Thai food, go to Pai. It's slight more expensive than Sukhothai ($2-3) but well worth it."}
{"text":"Really disorganized service. We were given the worst table at first, in an empty restaurant, because the other tables weren't wiped yet. We changed after 5 minutes.  The Pad Thai was really good, although when I asked for salt and pepper, the waiter smiled saying \"we don't have salt and pepper here\", as if it was the fanciest thing on Earth. No alternative offered. I doubt they don't use salt in the kitchen. A little container with salt would have been perfect..."}
{"text":"their menu is very similar to Khao San Road. probably because it was started by the same chef.  we ordered a delivery of Vegetable Spring Rolls, Sukhothai Pad Thai, Chicken Khao Soi, Vegan Khao Soi, and Tapioca pearls with coconut milk.  1) Vegetable spring rolls- hmmm i have to say it's a-ok. not that special but it still tastes good. crunchy, nice sweet and sour sauce to accompany them, the glass noodle filling is a nice touch. I would order the Garlic Tofu the next time i'm here.  2) Sukhothai pad thai - tastes awesome. boom. with a distinct nutty flavor.  3) Chicken khao soi - didn't try the broth.. but the egg noodles that goes with is fresh and it tasted awesome!  4) Vegan khao soi - i asked them if they can make their khao soi vegetarian because i was abstaining from meat consumption. the server said in the phone call that they were experimenting with it and said she'll give me a try so i went for it. it tastes AMAZING despite being vegan, even without any shrimp paste or meat broth. the curry was sooo yummy and was really rich. i couldn't finish it and had to keep the other half for my next meal.  5) Tapioca pearls with coconut milk - ahhhh it was sooooo yummy!! though i felt kinda overwhelmed with the curry khao soi + tapioca coconut milk combination. it would be better if you ordered something else without coconut milk before devouring this dessert."}
{"text":"Love the thai food here. Their spring rolls and Kai Soi Beef were spicy and delicious. The thai milk tea was a little too sweet though.  We came for lunch on the Friday before Christmas. The place was jammed packed. Line-ups formed right after we got seated. Even with the amount of people the hostess was still very helpful and accommodating.  The service was fast but the food was very very slow. The server kept coming to apologize for the back up in the kitchen cuz they were under staffed and didn't expect this many customers. I was starting to feel bad for her. When the food finally came it was so delicious our table just went silent.  This location is awesome, I won't have to go all the way to Adelaide for my thai food anymore."}
{"text":"I order from here WAY too much! Sukho Thai is hands down the best Thai food I've had. I've tried a few other places and nothing else has come close. I always get the green curry and my husband loves their cashew chicken. The cassava cake is delish!!"}
{"text":"Comforting spot in a shitty neighborhood.   Had the Sukhothai Pad Thai combo (with the smallest mango salad in the world...possibly 2.5 oz) and drink for ~$11. Got it Spicy (but not Thai spicy). It wasn't very spicy (or I'm that much of a man).   It easily stands out as being more memorable compared to other places' Pad Thai...wasn't ketchupy/saucy - noodles weren't heavy....there was a delightful amount of fresh cilantro used. Large portion...only a big fatso would want more on their plate.  Good spot- service was slow but friendly."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on March 23, 2018 and ordered the green curry with spring roll.  Within 1 hr of eating it I developed major indigestion and then shortly after, puking my guts out along with diarrhea all day.  I'm very certain I got food poisoning.    I'm writing this review, as I'm eating bland piece of white toast, so that the staff will hopefully see this review and ensure that safe food handling practices and/or products are thoroughly reviewed for freshness to prevent this from ever happening again.  Lucky I am not pregnant or elderly as this could have turned into something very serious.    I don't want this experience to taint my opininon of them because it is a common place I go to with colleagues."}
{"text":"Good food and resonably priced. Had the green curry and house pad thai, both were awesome."}
{"text":"I rather walk 30 mins and stand out in freezing cold for an hour to get a shared table at Khao San Road than ever go back to Sukhothai.  I ate here almost 3 times a week. The past month, they messed up each and every one of my orders.  Today, not only did they predictably mess up my order up again, one of the servers who happened to be passing by (i.e. not even our server) had the nerve to blame me and for 'not being specific enough Bro\".  How is \"Vegan Tofu Sukhothai Pad Thai, Thai Spicy' not specific?  As a once frequent customer, I urge the owner to try this to improve consistency.  Sit your servers and your chefs down, and get them to each write down what ingredients make up 'Vegan Tofu Sukhothai Pad Thai'. Maybe then my frustration will become apparent.   They just lost a regular customer, and an evangelist for their food. Despite the fact they are right across the street, I will never be stepping foot there again. At some point, giving away free meal just does not make up for loyalty."}
{"text":"This is the real deal!  No ketchup!  Owners who trained or are from Thailand. I'm thinking how can this tiny joint do so well in this neighbourhood?!    Small seating area but there is a downstairs area too.  Walls are decorated with photos from Thailand.  I had their signature Northern thai noodle dish - Sukhothai Pad Thai. Generous portion size, perfectly seasoned and I will be back to try something different."}
{"text":"I have been a regular since 2014 and have brought many friends, family and colleagues here. I always recommend the pad thai and red/green curries. It isn't WOW but it's up there. Taste is consistent, portion is generous and they have gotten better over the years (introduced new dishes, portion got slightly bigger), except that their Thai Spicy is now more muted in flavour and they increased their prices last year (+$1).  All in all, it is perfect if you're looking to have fun, relax and enjoy a night out. But it is not ideal for having deep conversations as the music is on full blast in the evenings. I would recommend going for lunch or Mon-Wed for dinner and calling to reserve for Thurs-Sat as it gets packed quickly.   Despite the glowing review, there is one thing that has been bothering me for years, but it has to be said: I find that some hosts/servers are racist and will give preferential treatment to white guests. Many times, I was refused a booth seat while walk-in guests were immediately offered. Service is inconsistent but mostly inattentive-to downright rude if not in a company of white guests. Every time it happens, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth and it really ruins the full experience. Food is awesome but they really need to up their game in terms of treating everyone with respect and courtesy."}
{"text":"Delicious! Khao soi was great as always and the pad thai was very flavourful. Service was slow but it was super friendly. Was really pleasantly surprised by the tamarind whiskey sour, so delicious. I'm glad it is nearby as I will be able to come back soon. Based on other reviews I will try to avoid prime times."}
{"text":"One of the best thai places in the city. Stick to their curries not pad thai. This location is cozy and small."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the better places for thai food in toronto, and they are not too expensive as well which is amazing! Service is quick and friendly and it's not too hard to get seats (which is both a good and bad thing).  One thing  to note is that their spice level may be different from other places, while I like my spice, I found medium to be a good level."}
{"text":"Prior to going to this restaurant the best Thai food I had ever eaten was in Barbados, a decade ago, at a restaurant that no longer exists.  The meal I had tonight surpassed that.  Everything my girlfriend and I ordered was absolutely fantastic.    The garlic chicken was delicious and moist and just spicy enough. The dipping sauce was lightly sweet without being cloying and added another wonderful note of flavor.  The basil curry was superb and had a fantastic blend of flavors.  The spring rolls were perhaps the best either of us have ever had - a mix of shredded vegetables and delicious mushrooms.  The dipping sauce for the spring rolls was a bit too sweet for either of our taste, but we simply dipped then in the other sauce and in our curries.    My favorite item however was the house specialty khao soi with noodles and chicken - recommended to me by our very friendly and helpful waitress.  It was like nothing I've ever had before - a unique blend of lemon grass, curry, chili, coriander and other flavors that mixed together to form something truly special.    The service was quick and our waitress was both very friendly and very helpful.  I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Don't be put off by how it appears from outside, inside this small place is clean and nicely decorated and the food is simply tremendous."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! The location is small and quaint! I used to really enjoy this restaurant unfortunately they have allowed their costumer service and ambiance to decline - BIG PROBLEM! The couriers constantly coming in and out of the restaurant picking up orders for Uber and such, walking straight through the dining room where people are eating, totally grossed me out."}
{"text":"If it isn't apparent I love successful family run operations. This family run wedge of curry-ness is a winner.  Make a reservation or expect to wait in a puddle of your own drool. Space is tight even with the addn'l space in the basement. Service is excellent and conversational. Food everything is excellent.  Get the shrimp chip starter ... something about that yummy dipping sauce that takes it over the edge. It's our go to for everyday Thai dining. Mmmm mmm mmmmmm."}
{"text":"I went this place twice, from previous experience I went back because their pad thai is good. However, second time I went (yesterday Friday 19th around 5:30pm) I had the worst experience ever.  Firstly, they don't greet the customers right away. Secondly, the waiter was the rudest waiter I've ever experienced. He rushed our meal the entire time. I felt like we were getting pushed to leave. The restaurant was not packed, and it was not that busy at all. I felt very uncomfortable eating there, their service is horrible. They do not even thank the customers who leave. I will never go to this place ever again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a convenient location. The place has nice decor. Definitely a busy restaurant - we still had to wait ~ 30 minutes around 9:15pm on a Friday night. The food overall was pretty good!"}
{"text":"So often I come on to Yelp to voice my discontent with an establishment, so I feel like I got to go ahead and buck that trend. I haven't done too much travelling in my life - certainly not to Thailand - so it may appear as if my word means very little... But this is the best Thai food I've ever had. And it's not just me - every person I've shared food with here agrees.  I don't know if it is authenticity that makes the difference, but there is a lot more going on - flavor & texture-wise - than your run of the mill Thai-for-white-people places around town. I usually get the Khao Soi with the beef, but everything else I've tried has been stellar as well."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Sukho Thai Cuisine: Thai Location: St Lawrence Market Address: 52 Wellington St E Price Range: $10~  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4  Service: 4  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Second location of Sukho Thai * Owned by same people who opened up Khao San Road and Sabai Sabai * Open for lunch and dinner * Good for big groups  I've been to Khao San Road couple times after my first visit. But my complaint everytime was how long I had to wait and the limited number of seating. So guess how happy I was to hear that they opened up bigger restaurant that serves exactly the same food as Khao San Road and is only couple blocks from where I live! I had to check it out for sure.  My friends and I went for dinner on a Tuesday night around 6pm and found the restaurant to be half full. Yay for not having to wait!  Ordered: Thai Iced Tea  * Glass for $4 * This is not your regular iced tea * It's bright orange and very creamy + sweet with bitter tea aftertaste * Honestly I didn't really like this the first time I tried it but it kind of grows on you  Ordered: Garlic Chicken 3/5  * Deep fried breaded garlic chicken served with sweet and sour garlic sauce for $9 * I remember being impressed with Garlic Tofu from Khao San Road, so I decided to give this a try * Chicken pieces were good bite size pieces with a crunch * I didn't find it to be anything special though, I personally prefer Garlic tofu  Ordered: Garlic Beef (Nua Gra Teaum) 4/5  * Stir fried garlic beef served with fried egg, cucumers and rice for $13 * This is similar to what you can get from Vietnamese restaurants * The key is to mix everything together with fried egg   Ordered: Beef Khao Soi 5/5  * Yellow noodles in curry gravy with green onions, coriander and light crispy noodle topping for $14 * You can choose chicken or beef but beef is highly recommended * This is something I found to be quite odd when I first tried it back at Khao San Road * However, this dish def grows on you and I really enjoy the creamy curry gravy * Beef pieces are very tender and it soaks up all the curry goodness * Noodles are chewy and cooked al dente  Ordered: Chicken Pad Thai 5/5  * Northern Thai version with peanuts and herbs for $13 * Dare I say that they serve probably the best Pad Thai in Toronto (most authentic as well) * It doesn't have that typical (Americanized) neon red color which is a big No-No! * This is a must order  Summary: If you haven't been to Khao San Road, make sure to give Sukho Thai a try. I would recommened going with couple people so you can order and try as much as possible. Although they do have more seats, they do fill up closer to dinner time so make sure to get there early. They def know what they are doing and you will leave with your belly filled and taste buds fully bursting with flavors of Thai."}
{"text":"Dinner visit. Seated immediately. Service was very good. Waiter worked efficiently and accurately. Ordered Islamic Noodles and Green Curry Chicken. Both are a hit for us and we keep going back. I highly recommend and will continue to return"}
{"text":"Every busy place, and for good reason, the food is delicious.  The veggie wraps were fantastic. Good combination of fresh  with flavors of cilantro, and as part of a complete bite with the savory peanut dip I would come back for this appetizer alone.   The Pad Thai was another winner with lots of flavor but not overwhelmingly so. Looking at other tables this was the most common dish I saw ordered while I was there. This plate had a lot of food. Most people ordered this for themselves to eat but the serving was generous and could feed one and a half people.  I also shared their yellow curry dish. This was simply amazing, and really demonstrated the skill of the kitchen blending spices. The curry was not an overwhelming flavor, more delicate with layers of other spices appropriately paired and mixed in a way that one didn't overwhelm any other. Pleasant amount of umami flavor.  I would recommend sharing a few dishes if you come here so you can try different things. You will come away very well fed.  Also, I came on a Friday night and it was very busy and had to wait. If you don't have the time to wait or want to bring a big group I would highly recommend making a dinner reservation. Also, it was incredibly loud at dinner time. I would not recommend this place if you are looking for a quite dinner place. Sitting with my dinner partner I could hardly hear them speaking from accross the table.."}
{"text":"I generally like it here-love the sapporo steins! food is decent and prices are good so what the hey ambiance is pretty cool mango salad on my last visit lacked the components of a mango salad-peanuts, peppers, red onions and cilantro-I guess its like a winter Toronto mango salad with sugar and cabbage and not too ripe mango- Whaddya gonna do when its winter?  Dishes are sometimes a bit one note-but you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"I went to the Wellington Street location of Sukho Thai, and it was a good experience with great flavors and a bonus is that it serves all halal meat."}
{"text":"Went here for friend's birthday the other night and I can't remember for the life of me, if I've been to one of their other locations before.  I feel like I have, though. Anyway, I'm gonna treat the other night as my first time and with a fresh tastebuds.    Shrimp Chips - Not your regular shrimp chips that you'd get with your crispy fried chicken from any other Asian restaurant.  Theirs had more density to it and also came with a flavourful tamarind dip.  Mind you, the chips on their own were already good but the tamarind dip added a nice kick.  Was nice to start off with or if you're also feeling a bit peckish. 5/5.   Calamari - If you love calamari, theirs is also an app to try.  The batter was very flavourful, squid was cooked to perfection and it wasn't greasy at all.  One thing was that although the presentation was pretty, it portion was a little deceiving. It was served on top some fried noodles, which again, looked nice but who really eats the fried noodles? Other than that, it was also one of the most delicious calamari I've had. 5/5.  Khao Soi - Normally I would also choose either red or green curry but since I got curry with this dish, I figured why not.  Plus, it's what my friend had recommended and kept raving about.  Although I can handle spice, I opted for just a mild one and also with chicken.  I must say, it was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  The presentation was beautiful and the serving was very generous.  Quite generous that I had some leftover which I utterly enjoyed the following day.  And yes, it was even more flavourful, as most dishes are the following day since the flavours just enhanced more.  I would definitely go back here just for this dish. 5/5"}
{"text":"Pros:  *Best pad Thai I ever had! It was flavourful and not drying.  *Their fried fish platter isn't dry at all. Very crispy on the outside and juicy on inside. The batter is much better than fish and chip's fried fish. 90% fish, 10% breading   Cons:  * $3 lemongrass iced tea tasted like water mixed with syrup. It was also too sweet and I had to mix more water with it.  *Service was a bit slow but that's understandable since it was a Saturday evening.   Wait time: 10 mins."}
{"text":"Wow!   Finally I visit this gem of Thai restaurant. What had I been waiting for? Not sure but my sister was in town and we decided to go for some Thai, so why not the claimed-to-be best Thai food in Toronto?   We walked in around 1:30 on a Wednesday. People has clearly just left and we were the only ones around for a sit down meal. We sat, ordered, and let the games begin. First, with a fresh vegetarian roll. The rice paper held up very nicely with red pepper, mango, lettuce, rice noodles, thai basil and cilantro inside. The peanut sauce was unreal. The best I've ever had, warm and fresh. When we wanted some more for our last roll they said, no... Because it's made to order, I suppose.   Also we tried the Sukho Thai Pad Thai. It was yummy with a kick and great noodle consistency. My favourite was the red curry, by a long shot which just shows how great this was, since I loved the other dishes as well. The red curry is rich and flavourful with all the expected vegetables, plus squash! Acorn squash? It was a wonderful combination. The textures complimented each other extremely well.  We got medium for both dishes and were satisfied with the spiciness. There are also ample leftovers in the frige since the portions are a hefty size. As I paid the bill, I was asked what I thought of the meal and it was so genuine. I was very glad that I could say how delicious it was (in Thai, they write key words on a chalkboard) and really mean it. I will definitely be back for a sit down or take out."}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about this place but I was disappointed with the Khao Soi. It was SO THICK! Didn't seem like a soup, more like pure coconut cream. It was way too rich. I ate a lot of Khao Soi in Thailand and the broth was much thinner. I can't eat pure cream like that.  That being said, others at my table ordered green and red curries, and those were both delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent Thai food. A serious hole in the wall GEM. I have easily passed this place about a hundred times but never went in until recent through a recommendation from multiple friends. Make sure you keep your eyes peeled when deciding to go to Sukho Thai!  The curry dishes are amazing (I am in love with the Panang and the Green curry). The Pad Thai is also amazing! You can choose your level of spicy-ness... Try the medium if you can handle spice. I am usually pretty good with spicy so I got spicy and found it a little too spicy for my liking.   The service is great but it's a small restaurant. I would recommend going in and ordering take-out. They are super busy so they aren't always able to answer their phone."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Service was mediocre and servers when asked to recommend something from menu, they stare at you like your from Mars and then awkwardly say, everything is good! We asked for 3 pad thai, 1 mild and 2 medium spice. They came all super spicy and we couldn't eat the food. This place is good for cheap quick and low quality food and service. Even Salad King is way better! Do not recommend unless there is nothing else open and make sure you ask no spice at all; you can add it yourself later if you must."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: 8.5/10 Service: 7.5/10 Overall experience: 9/10  If you're like me and you live north of Toronto, the best places to eat are usually around Union Station. Grab food, hop on a GO bus. For your needs, I would definitely recommend Sukho Thai.  I ordered the khao soi, which is egg noodles in a curry. The dish is topped off with crispy noodles that you can dunk into the curry to soak up. My friend ordered their pad thai, which I was happy about, because it gave me a chance to try two very classic Thai dishes that every Thai restaurant should be held to.   The khao soi was really great. I opted for the \"spicy\" level of spiciness (on a scale of mild, medium, spicy and Sukho Thai spicy). If you can handle your spice, and like a kick, would recommend this. The coconut milk in the curry helps to tone it down, so it's not as bad as you would think.  The one bite I had of the pad thai (my friends are greedy with their food) was also good. Sweet and with a strong peanut flavour to start, the noodles were soft and the flavour was definitely there.  The service was average. Nothing to write home about, but the waiter got the job done and earned himself a regular tip in the process.   Bottom line: if you're looking for tasty, decently priced food near Union Station, go here."}
{"text":"Ordered here from Uber Eats. Food took 1 hour to arrive. Most of the dishes were warm but not hot. Ordered Tom Yum Kung starter, Guaytiaw Tofu noodle soup, fresh shrimp rolls, masaman shrimp currt (sweeter tamarind flavour) extra steamed rice, chicken satay appetizers, spring rolls, andSukho pad thai chicken.  Must order dishes are: Fresh spring rolls, any pad thai, and the massman curry. Skip the spring rolls and soups.  Problem: They have different spice levels from mild, medium, spicy and thai spicy (heat spectrum .. We ordered 2 dishes to be thai spicy (tom yum kung soup and the pad thai) however there was a huge difference in heat levels. If we order both to be thai spicy, we dont expect one to be crazy f'ing hot from thai spice and the other to be medium. It threw me off and I got confused about which was the real heat. Overall, the lady over the phone was nice and helpful with menu suggestions, and she was indeed correct when suggesting the pad thai as the best seller.  Check this place out"}
{"text":"I heard mixed reviews with this location, but both times I've gone, I've had a good experience.  It's quite busy due to the after work crowd, but never felt rushed while eating."}
{"text":"I've been to this place tons of times and you just can't go wrong with the food. The cherry on top is that it's halal.   We were a party of 6 and we walked in without resos. We were seated pretty quick. The server ( her name was Peggy) was super helpful and polite. She dealt with all our requests with ease and was super fast.   The place lost a star because it took an hour to get our food to us. They compensated us by giving us free shrimp crackers. Because we were in a group I guess time went by in conversation.   Anyway everyone has an off day. The food was still delicious."}
{"text":"Last night I took my family of 8 to Suhko Thai for my moms birthday. I suggested the place because I really like the food and thought they would too.  So first thing that I wasn't happy with was that my favourite dish(the fish which I was raving about) was not properly cooked. It was borderline raw, wet and cold at the thickest part). We were only able to eat about a third of it. At the end of the meal, the waiter took off half the price. We basically paid $8 for rice, a little mango salad and a third of the fish. Not a big deal. Then when it came time to paying the bill, the waiter never mentioned that the 17% gratuity was already on the bill, so I ended up paying tip twice. He also didn't give me the itemized bill until after when I asked him for it. When I realized the error, he only returned the original tip which was less than what he actually should have returned since the second tip was on the full amount. Again just $6 so it's not that big of a deal. I understand it's my fault for not thoroughly checking. I should have triple checked and said something but 1. I've got baby brain at the moment 2. I was embarrassed to have to go back to him multiple times regarding the bill while my family was watching. In the end, I paid more than I should have. The amount doesn't matter but the principle does. Which is why I don't think I will be returning to this restaurant. Paying for a bill shouldn't be that complicated and now I feel like I have to check my bill from now on since the same thing happened at a dessert place later that evening. Is it just me or aren't waiters supposed to inform you that the gratuity is already included?"}
{"text":"this review is for their takeout only.   i never dine-in at sukho thai, and since this location is the closest to me, i mostly just order and pick up. the pad thai is DIVINE- i have dreams about it. it's the perfect balance of tangy, savoury, and sweet, and never done with tomato sauce like some other more westernized thai places. this is fish sauce territory.   i've always had a good experience ordering here. the food is consistent- always ready in under 20 minutes. the one bad thing about this location is that the street that it's on is a little seedy."}
{"text":"I first heard about this Thai restaurant through work. The department would order delivery almost every other week.   I ordered the  Guaytiaw Sukhothai with Beef - This was probably the best beef i've had. It basically melted in my mouth. I'm not sure how long they cook it for but  the texture was amazing. The soup base was pretty good. I think the only thing i would say is the portion size was a bit small for the price i paid. But i would definitely order it again for the beef.  I decided to go actually go to the restaurant with my boyfriend after work on a Friday night. It was packed. Waited almost 40 mins for a table. I would give the decor a 2/5 - There were some cute pictures from Thailand and probably the owners. -   It was worth the 40 min wait. I ordered the Khao Soi with Beef and Pad Kee Mao. We also saw a couple with dessert and i decided to give that a try too. Boy the Khao Soi was AMAZING. The sauce was perfect and again the beef was so tender. I really enjoyed the dessert tapioca with coconut milk. -- I would probably just go there for dessert."}
{"text":"I've been here about 20+ times and it's been on a slow decline every time. I think it's because the owners have just opened a new restaurant and are not as diligent with running this one. Regardless, here are the major points: - Service is much slower now (took 30+ minutes for 2 dishes) - Khao Soi which used to be my FAVOURITE dish had only about 1 bowl worth of noodles... what were we to do with the rest of the curry? - Khao Soi beef was not tender and almost inedible - When you call to make a reservation, expect that they will be rude to you. I have called every time I've gone and each time, they are rude rude rude.  - Pla Taud is yummy and has been consistent - Sukhothai pad thai is more traditional than other restaurants (ie. more like what you'd find in streets of Thailand) but very greasy and lacking peices of protein   I'm hoping once the other restaurant is looked after, this place will start to get better again. Til then, only 3 stars...."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Possible my most favourite thai restaurant in Toronto. Their khao soi is almost always my first choice for order, and the pad thai is a close second! always busy, but worth the wait sometimes. Go there all the time, for lunch and dinner, and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous service. I used to come here every week and haven't been back for a while. Now it takes about an hour to get food after ordering. That's after the ridiculous wait time, waiting for the server. 2 stars is being generous... and rounding up... 0 stars for service, 1.5 star for food being decent."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  After trying out several Thai restaurants, I feel like this is the 2nd best Thai restaurant in town (Best might be Pai).  I tend to order Beef Khao Soi, Chicken Thai Fried Rice, Beef Pad Kee Mao, and Chicken PadThai because they are delicious with generous portions. You can choose the ingredients (tofu, chicken, beef, shrimp with extra cost $1.00) but I love how you can choose the spiciness from mild to thai spicy. If you love spicy food, you gotta choose thai spicy or else, you'd be disappointed. Their fried rice might not be as spicy as you'd like it to be but they give fish sauce to compensate. PadThai is like the sweeter version of Pad Kee Mao with different vegetables so bear that in mind. I like how it (Pad Thai) doesn't taste like ketchup.  As you might know, when you fry something, garlic is the mandatory ingredient in most cases and I like how you could literally taste it on their fried rice. I also tried their several curry dishes and even though they were tasty, I felt like the portions were so small to the point where I tend to not order them.  warning: Their noodle dishes (especially Pad Kee Mao) are somewhat inconsistent.  UPDATE: In terms of taste(& quality), Pai might be better. In terms of quantity, Sukhothai takes the cake."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had, and I really prefer this original location to their new one in St Lawrence Market.   The only thing is don't try to order delivery unless you want to eat in 1.5-2 hours. Much better to pick it up yourself.  The vegetable fresh rolls, which I've found to not always be on the menu but are always available, are incredible! As is everything else I've tried."}
{"text":"i don't even know why other thai places in toronto are still in business, beyond the sad fact that some people are happy tolerating receiving garbage when they paid for food.   there's no point in eating thai food anywhere else in this city, especially after they opened up their second location on wellington. srsly everything is good. ask for fish in the curries, because i don't think it is listed, but they will sub it in for you.   delivery and service sometimes takes forever, especially at the parliament location, however. they would benefit from hiring some more delivery people, and like, a full-time person just to answer the phones, because they literally never stop ringing.  another downside is that they aren't open on sundays at the parliament location, so we were forced to eat horrible food from another thai place (see my review on the friendly thai)."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai restaurant...I work nearby and I can say that several of my coworkers are developing unhealthy addictions to Sukho Thai take out. My fave dish is the Pad Kee Mao. This place definitely rivals Khao San Road in my opinion - but take out is the way to go because it's not much of an eat-in place!"}
{"text":"For years I have loved everything the original Khao San Road chefs have come up with. But this time it wasn't the taste that frustrated me.   I went to Sukho Thai with a group of friends, one of which suffers from Celiac Disease. He is clear to tell everyone about his allergy when he dines out. Luckily for him Sukho has a variety of options for him. He ordered the fresh rolls which the manager assured were fine. They came out and it wasn't until mid way through the meal that he was informed that a mistake had been made, although the fresh rolls were fine their sauce was not in fact gf.   I know that mistakes can happen but this one is not okay. Celiac disease is not a gluten sensitivity or intolerance, it is a severe gluten allergy that can cause a body serious damage. This mistake is unacceptable.   To top it off no discount, no major apology and no remedy was put in place to correct this mistake. It was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, we would get it once a week for lunch at work, but last few times I've been there it's felt like the quality has been slipping. The pad kee mao is my go to dish but they do very good curry as well."}
{"text":"Had their vegetarian green curry - it was just ok. I had their vegetarian red curry with squash- it was ok too. Their springrolls are good but there has been occasion when they serve them to me when they were not fresh. It's expensive for what you get, especially in consideration of their location - not the most convenient. Place -a bit run down."}
{"text":"I feel like if there is a required eating list for Yelp Elites, Sukho Thai would definitely be near the top!  This tiny place serves up some of the best Thai food I've had in the city. I'm completely addicted to the Khao Soi. I think you are supposed to split it between two people, but I end up eating it on my own.  Then I swirl my chopsticks around the curry sauce...aromatic and thick, hunting for any noodles trying to escape..  I debated whether to pack sauce. Just the sauce.  ...But I figured, I'll just order more curry to-go and have it for dinner.  Gaeng Masaman isn't as popular as some of the other curries, but I really like the peanuts.  It's a nice sweet curry with potato and it's freaking good.  Even when you reheat it hours later.  I think the food here is fabulous, but admittedly, I'm a fan of their sister restaurant  KSR.    I'm just not a huge fan of the location of Sukho Thai.  I wouldn't really want to park my car there.  While waiting for the bus, I had scary teenagers asking me how to get to Regent Park.  I told them I didn't know and then I stood next to hipsters with dogs who looked more robbable than myself.  I'm just a girl with a take-out bag of curry, I don't want any trouble."}
{"text":"Wow. I'd slap my sister for this stir fry beef. Excellent food. Nice atmosphere. Come here."}
{"text":"Was introduced to SukhoThai 2 years ago and have been a handful of times to the locations on Front and Dundas.   Am a loyal customer because the food is consistently delicious! We like that SukhoThai can vegan-ize a lot of dishes so this is a place we can take all our friends to!    - Best pad Thai in the city, with the right combo of sweet, tangy and spicy  - Fantastically flavourful green curry with chunks of squash and just the right thickness to the sauce  - Delicious coconut soup that makes my taste buds so happy. A complex symphony of flavours! - The spring rolls are delicious! Filled with mushrooms not just cheap cabbage.   We have been to the Wellington St. and the Dundas St. locations. (Tip: Both locations get super loud on the weekends.)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch because I'm a fan of the original sukho thai and khao san road, and while the food was good as usual, the service was not, and ended up with us having to rush through lunch to get back to our offices for work.  It may just have been our server, but there were several major issues. First, we waited a very long time for our food, at least 20 minutes. Second, they forgot one of the dishes but still charged for it on the bill.  Third, the server was really aggressive and weird; three of us ordered the exact same dish (Sukhothai Pad Thai, medium spicy) and when I tried to pass the plate he gave me to my friend next to me, who I knew had ordered the same thing, he wouldn't let me and insisted that dish was MINE, not HIS.  There were a few more awkward moments with our server, which just made us feel uncomfortable every time he showed up.  Because of the long time we had to wait for our food, and the screw-up with our bill, we were rushing at the end of the meal to wrap up and pay.  We rushed out of the restaurant an hour and fifteen minutes after we started, which considering the restaurant is in the business district, is a little bit unacceptable.  Two hour lunch, anyone?"}
{"text":"I had only heard of this place after learning about Khao San Road, and so I was pleasantly surprised to find the food is pretty much the same and just as good. The main differences between the two places are in decor, and I believe the different types of pad thai are at least named differently, but most of the other dishes are the exact same. This place is more of a \"take out\" place: smaller and more run down, and with far less seating. Although, any time I go to Khao San Road I can't even get in the door, so effectively, this place has more seating.  The place was pretty empty at the time we arrived for a late lunch, so we sat down instead of taking out, and the one lady serving the place was very nice and could practically read our minds; she even brought us our take-out container for leftovers just as we turned to ask her for it.  As I mentioned, food was fantastic; as good as my five-star review of Khao San Road.  The reason for one less star? The price was the same as Khao San Road (at least for lunch, not for dinner). If I'm eating at a \"take out\" place, then I expect the prices to reflect that.  Other than that, it would have been five stars."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty but the bathrooms were kinda gross. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. It was satisfactory but nothing special."}
{"text":"First time, not good. Second time, bad. Food court quality Thai food."}
{"text":"We visited here based on words of blogs by Japanese residents of Toronto. Had Pat-Thai, fried rice, yellow curry. Every dish was decent and delicious. Only downside is that it is a very busy place in dinner time and you have to wait half an hour for your mains to be served. It was not particularly kids-friendly, though it was too busy a place for any guest around to complain about our kid. ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I visited with my friends. We were a group of 3 and the server asked us to sit by the bar or at a 2-people seat because it was busy. I was not happy because there was a table with 4 people. Also, other 4-seaters appeared soon after but they never offered us to take those seats. The food was great. Every dish was packed with flavour and various spices. I especially liked the fish with mango salad, which was huge. The servers were extremely busy and I had to ask multiple times for a fork and the bill. I think this place scores high for flavour. Unfortunately I would need to be convinced for a second visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. I ordered the Khao Soi with beef the  first time and it was very tasty! The portion of the Khao Soi was very good for one person.   I ordered the green curry in the second time and it was also tasty. However, the portion of rice was very small and an average adult would need 2-3 portions of rice which you have to pay extra for.   I also recommend the Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"This place was closed for 3 months and recently reopened. I read an article about it's reopening yesterday so I gave it a try last night for dinner. I had been here once before and wasn't that impressed but decided to give it a try since it typically gets rave reviews. Again, not impressed. The service was awful - enough for me to not want to return. The food was ok - but I found it too rich and too salty. There are so many other great thai places in the city that I will never go back here. I guess if you live in the area, it would be a convenient restaurant but definately not worth the drive from the west end."}
{"text":"Located on Wellington near the St. Lawrence Market, Sukho Thai is the more upscale version of Pai Northern Thai.    The prices are a smidgen higher (by roughly $1-3), but the as some of the dishes here aren't available at Pai, I'm willing to chalk it up to possibly the cost of ingredients or more assembly time.    Another marked difference is the ambience, which is not quite as casual and street-style.  Sukho's dishes are served on white, teardrop plates or classic square whites.  The interior is a dark wood, and the lights are dimmed.  Fancier pants, y'know?  Yet not so fancy that you can't wear jeans or something.   The first time I came here, I got a crispy-fried fish (basa?) served with a small dipping-sauce amount of green curry.  It's yummy, and I appreciated that they were served up in separate dishes to maintain the height of crispness of the fish.  I don't think it's on the lunch menu though, so my lunchtime go-to is the panang curry with fish.  Less liquidy than the other curries (i.e. red or green), the panang is thicker and more pungent on spices than the predominantly coconut milk flavour that you get from the others.  The fish, in case you were wondering, is not fried.  When ordering, just remember that there's the usual mild, medium, hot, but then there's a THAI mild, medium and hot.  Thai mild is what we consider medium here.  If you accidentally ordered a step too spicy, I suggest that you order the Thai Iced Tea, a black tea that's been super sweetened by condensed milk.  It will put out that fire in your mouth in no time."}
{"text":"Went last night with a party of six. We had a reservation which was a good thing because it was very busy.  The food was amazing - fresh and well prepared. Best Thai food I have had anywhere in Toronto.  Service was good... a tiny bit slow but they were very busy. The food came quickly and the wait staff were helpful and attentive.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Normally, curry means vegetables and meats cooked in aromatic spices. I ordered Yellow Curry Beef at the dundas location and expected the beef to be cooked in the curry. It is bland boiled potatoes and gray looking beef with a curry sauce over rice.  Way over priced. No vegetables, but the bland boiled beef was awful.  Their pad thai is good but this was horrid"}
{"text":"This is one of my lunch haunts that won't break the bank. However I have to knock down a star for service because they aren't very attentive and food takes a long time coming out. Larger auto-gratuity for a larger party always rubbed me the wrong way. I really feel like when there's an auto-gratuity involved the service goes down further."}
{"text":"Fantastic Signature Pad Thai. This is a MUST have. For $15 I was a bit worried about the portion, but it definitely generous enough for 2 people unless you are extremely ravenous! The flavors were exquisite, and this is definitely one of the best pad thai I've had thus far in the GTA. I could go on eating and eating this.  I would recommend getting your spice to either mild or medium unless you are going beast mode. Spicy was apparently REALLY spicy, my friend could not finish his and it became an unpleasant experience.  Dock 1 star because ordering and service was slow overall (and not that attentive) even though the place was busy but not packed."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food, but my complaint is the atmosphere. It's definitely a hole in the wall. Feels like you're dining at a dingy food court with waiters. I will go back, but it is not my favorite in the city!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend going to this location. We ordered three cashew chickens and the dishes came without any cashews. When asked why a chicken cashew dish doesn't have cashew, they were oh we forgot to add it and just went to the kitchen and brought us plain cashews to add to the dish. They didn't apologise and acted as if nothing happened.  The service was very slow and not good customer service."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of Thai food places and I got to say that this place has good Thai ice tea. It's not as sweet as most places but still not as great as a night market but still better than anything downtown. I ordered the Beef Khao Soi since everyone was raving about it. It's worth the hype! I really enjoyed it! The portion was good and I think it was worth the price. The place is really cute with a lot of fairy lights; good for a date ;) This place is really busy so service was a bit slow but I hope that when it isnt, it would be bomb."}
{"text":"Not sure why this is only 4 star. It is arguably the best thai food in he city. The physical space is not the best physical space  but the food and the friendly staff make up for it."}
{"text":"While the food was good the service was terrible. The server berated one in our party for spilling on the menu and then after waiting an hour for our food  we asked where it was since no one had come to say anything they said they were running out of noodles and were portioning the meals. Then when everyone but two had been served their food, the two left were informed that they had to choose something else because they had run out of noodles for them. The server did not care that they had not communicated anything to us and refused to comp the people who had to go without food for 1.5 hours until several minutes of debating that this was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Soooooo yummy!!!!! Everything was sooooo good! From the pad Thai to the Penang and the green curry! The coconut soup and the mango salad were delicious and the coconut tapioca desert and the Thai iced tea were the best thing I've ever tasted!!! I can't wait to eat here over and over again!!!!!! The service was also very nice! We ordered take out and got lost but they still waited after closing time to give us our food and we're kind enough to help carry the food to the car."}
{"text":"I heard this place was supposed to be as good as Khoa San road, however the food I got didnt compare. The Penang curry had hardly any curry to it, their pad Thai was ok and I actually ended up feeling sick afterwards. The vibe and the sfaff is pretty nice - maybe better for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai place. The food is absolutely amazing and the portions are huge. The customer service was alright. The interiors and decor is very authentic and nice. The washrooms are clean but it is very loud inside. I recommend this place for anyone wanting to try authentic Thai food. I got the pad Thai and it was the best pad Thai I ever had. The prices are a bit higher but worth every penny. A good place for a date or to hang out with friends and its halal for all the halal foodies out there."}
{"text":"Food is well balanced and carefully prepared. Worth every penny. Service was problematic when they first opened but has improved drastically. Music is awesome. Order the tom yum kung and shrimp chips with tamarind."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in Toronto! It's always our go to and their khao soi is to diiiiiiiiiiie for."}
{"text":"Still the best Thai food I have ever tasted. You can't go wrong with the Khao Soi and I love how they use actual chunks of chicken instead of thin slices - it really adds to the dish.  I went with my friend Matt tonight and we had the garlic shrimp to start. It was pretty good but it's the tasty Khao Soi that hits the spot for me every time.  The service is pretty good and the prices are very reasonable. Get there early or you will be in for quite a wait. They also offer take out but don't bother with delivery, it apparently takes forever and it looks like they only have one or two delivery drivers."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing. Our previous go-to Thai resto was Mengrai Thai (which is pretty amazing and hard to top) but Sukho Thai does it. Their Khao Soi and Massaman curry are exceptional. The only thing that wasn't was the shrimp chips - not because they are bad, but the tiny serving of tamarind sauce is disproportionately small relative to the quantity of chips. That aside, the one critical piece of advice for those wanting delivery is to order 2.5 hours ahead of time (seriously) as they are insanely busy - otherwise known as consistently understaffed. Overall, Sukho Thai is exceptional."}
{"text":"Sukhothai had been recommended to my boyfriend and I several times. We absolutely love Salad King and we were told by a few people that they thought Sukhothai was even better. We have been there 3x now and I have to say, it's just ok. But let's backtrack a little. The staff are always super friendly. In fact, the first time I went there was a clearly inebriated individual (it was like 5pm but ok) who tried to physically fight the manager, and the manager handled the situation like a pro. The decor is gorgeous. But the food is just ok. I've had the pad Thai, pad Kee mao, garlic chicken nuggets, red curry (lunch special) and Panang curry. The only items I'd get again would be the red curry and the pad Thai, which is disappointing because I absolutely love Panang curry usually. The flavours are just missing in the dishes I find, and I've gotten some medium and others spicy. But, it is decent, hence why I do occasionally go back."}
{"text":"Food here is not bad; it's easy to get to after work (near the heart of the financial district), and usually has a table for a small group at peak hours. Menu has the stereotypical thai dishes (pad thai, khao soi etc), and tastes quite average. If you're craving some legit Thai food, I would recommend walking 10 extra minutes and going to Pai on the west side, if you're not in a big rush."}
{"text":"Thai tea was good, apetizers was good....we got the garlic shrimp. The entrées were good too. My bf got shrimp pad tai which he absolutely enjoyed. I forgot the name of what I got as it was recommended by our waitress. It was tofu and noodles in some kind of curry sauce, it was pretty good though. Lastly, the service was great which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Taste: I ordered the khao soi with beef which was delicious. You can also get it with chicken or tofu. Sad to say that it was my first khao soi dish so I can't really compare it to any others. It was creamy with the perfect amount of spices and coconut milk flavour. There was a generous amount of beef and it was so tender! Loved the crunchy noodles on top because it adds different textures to the dish. The khao soi is must try! I ended the meal off with mango sticky rice. It was nice and rich and the rice was the perfect warm temperature.  Service: The service was the only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars. It wasn't bad, but our server just seemed a little lost overall. When we ordered the mango sticky rice, he wasn't sure if it was available. He did mention that he hadn't worked here in a while... maybe he was just having an off day.   Value: Great value for what you get. The khao soi was $14 and had a lot of meat in it, and I left full and satisfied. The mango sticky rice was $6.  Ambiance: Very nice with a relaxed feel. Fun background music that really complimented the place."}
{"text":"Ever since my local favorite Thai restaurant (Vanipha Lanna) closed, I've been looking for another restaurant to fill the void. I came across Sukhothai after a few Google searches and browsing through Yelp.  A little far from where I live, but I was in the mood to explore.   I took my time getting to the restaurant thinking that they would be open throughout the afternoon. After finding this hole-in-a-wall restaurant, my heart sank when I saw the closed sign. They are closed between 2:30-5:00, so for anyone else who frequently grabs a late lunch, arrive before 2:30. We were lucky, as the door was still open, so we  went inside and  somehow managed to convince them to serve us.   The physical decor of the restaurant is nothing to write home about. It's located on Parliament Street, in a somewhat run-down (although up and coming) Regent Park neighborhood. The restaurant is tiny, with seating capacity for maybe 14 people, and looks like a townhouse converted into a restaurant. From what I can tell, their take-out business is as busy as their dine-in business.   We ordered a spring rolls, mango salad, chicken green curry and a shrimp pad thai. The food came out promptly. First thing out was the mango salad. It was actually part of a combo, where you pay $2 for a drink and salad. Nothing terribly exciting or fancy. Pretty standard mango salad consisting of sliced mangos, red peppers, green peppers and cucumbers with a trace of lime and fish sauce. I was disappointed by the lack of peanuts and cilantro, but that's nitpicking. For an extra 2 bucks, it was a pretty decent and fresh salad.  The deep fried spring rolls arrived next. I found it \"odd\" that they came out with 3 rolls, but 3 is better than 2 I suppose :). I'm not sure if they're made in house, but regardless they were quite tasty. Perfectly crispy, stuffed with mushrooms and clear noodles. I would definitely order them again.  The chicken green curry was the highlight of the meal for me. It's a dish that I always order at Thai restaurants, so it serves as my frame of reference. It had the perfect consistency - not too thick and not too watery. It was served with basil, bamboo shoots and green peppers. Just the right amount of coconut milk and a trace of lemongrass. Not to mention a decent size portion enough to feed two, if you count all the sauce and a serving of rice. I will have to try their other curries next time.  Next was the Sukhothai Pad Thai. Don't ask me what the difference is between this and the regular pad thai, because I have no idea. It cost a dollar more and had the restaurant's name in it, so I figured it had to be better. We ordered it with shrimp. Just like other reviewers have mentioned, it has a good balance of sweet and sour. It tastes as if they use a real tamarind base for their sauce, unlike some other Thai restaurants i've been too. Definitely, one of the best pad thais i've had. Actually, today I had pad thai for dinner which paled in comparison to Sukhothai. It actually made me a little sad inside. Again, generous portions almost enough to feed two.  I went to Sukhothai with high expectations and my expectations were met. I can't wait to go back to try other dishes. Everyone's been raving about the Khao Soi, Shrimp chips and Tom Kha Gai. I also somehow overlooked the dessert section. What was I thinking? This is one of those restaurants where I literally want to try everything on the menu. I'll give the restaurant a 4.5/5. Not a perfect 5 just because of its location and physical decor. I encourage everyone to swing by if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation from a friend , I decided to come here for an early dinner on a Saturday night . There were surprisingly many amount of tables occupied when we got there around 5:30pm.   Food 3.5/5 We tried the tom yum soup ($12 dinner size with rice), chicken khao soi ($15), crispy shrimp rolls ($10), garlic shrimp ($9) and the Thai iced tea. To begin, the tom yum soup was very flavourful. The soup had a spicy kick with a hint of lemongrass that wasn't too overpowering.  Each spoon was full? of ingredients such as shrimp and peppers which definitely added value since they didn't skimp out.  I appreciated that the photos in the menu were genuine representations of what was presented.  Service 4/5 We did go fairly early in the evening so the server was fairly attentive. He regularly checked up on us and was quick to answer all questions."}
{"text":"The food here has changed as the original cooks were moved to their new location. Very inefficient wait service because a lot of time people are confused where and how to line up or to wait. It's also weird to see the TD bank guy on queen and parliament walking in and out the kitchen like a headless chicken. ??? Anyway....I left the restaurant after knowing that I had to wait for 20-30 mins and seeing that this lack of management place."}
{"text":"I'm relieved to know that it wasn't just me that had a HUGE issue with the customer service and disorganization of this establishment.  I had a very similar experience as the previous reviewer, ST.  When I asked to speak with management, I was told by the young FOH staff that they were not available.  What kind of management hides behind their waitstaff?  On top of it all, their food is only mediocre.  I ordered the tofu pad thai and it tasted like dozens of other pad thai's I've had over the years.  Nothing exceptional about it.  Toronto is a food mecca and not only do you have to have quality food, but exceptional customer service as well.  I wish I could erase my memory of ever patronizing this establishment."}
{"text":"This place used to be a Mexican restaurant that was actually pretty good.. first time going here since Sukho Thai became the new face.  Quite the difference in decor that's for certain.  The menu is pretty simple with about a half dozen options of dish types which can be ordered with various main ingredients.  Like soup, fried rice, noodles, stir fry, and a couple more.  Which can each be ordered with vegetables,  tofu, chicken, beef, or shrimp which makes for a decent variety.  We tried the ginger chicken appetizer which is breaded fried chicken nuggets and comes with a nice spicy dip sauce.  Very tasty and great for sharing I'd say for up to 3 people.  Mains were good too.  We had stir fry veggies, chicken fried rice, and noodles with beef. Everything was good.  And quantity was just about right for 3.  I especially liked the fried rice and would have it again for sure.  Didn't make it to dessert this time but they have some cakes and a couple other options. I'd say I'll come back here again.  The food was so flavorful I could still taste it later.  Hint, have some gum if you have a meeting to follow :)"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and have it quite regularly. I've been here a few times and have to say their food is pretty mediocre. Their Pad Thai which is my favourite order when I go to Thai restos is below average. The main issue is the noodles are soggy and drenched in Pad Thai sauce. The sauce is also pretty bland so it just becomes a mouthful of soggy bland noodles. I had beef Pad Thai and their beef was extremely chewy and overdone. Their curry is Ok, nothing special. Tasted like Thai Express food court Thai food. Overall I would not recommend because it's way too overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"It is HALAL! (You can google it)   Such an amazing place! I only wish I had a better picture!   Top left: Thai Fried Rice  Top right: Gaeng Masaman Center: Khao Soi  Each dish was friggin' delicious! But by far the best was Gaeng Masaman - literally blew my mind how good it was!   Not sure what I was expecting, but it was definitely not this!  Definitely going again to try diff things!"}
{"text":"Well, I just tried calling for delivery for my first experience at 9 pm on a Saturday.  I asked for just that and was told, \"No, we're not taking any more orders for delivery tonight...\"  *click* Hello? You just hung up on me? Wow."}
{"text":"Probably best to avoid take out from this restaurant. On two occasions I was given the wrong curry, didn't bother going back.   Today I ordered at 730P, was told the food would take 20-25 min. I showed up at 855. Wasn't able to leave with my food until 812P. The whole point of calling ahead to order was to reduce the wait time in a busy/hectic environment. Finding out while I waiting that a large party was in the basement delaying food orders, understandable, I guess. It's frustrating, by now management should be able to properly manage food flow at busy times. Prices at the restaurant have gone up but the quality and service have been a problem. My order for today was not worth the additional wait or price. Browning lettuce in my wraps. Curry with very little sauce and the rice was mush.   I need to stop ordering from here out of convenience."}
{"text":"We got a pad Thai and pad kee mao takeout. Both were so bland and uninteresting - as if the chef didn't even try.  It used to be so much better, sad, but we're probably not coming back."}
{"text":"The food is really great here but the service is lacking. I've only been once but the people I was with echoed the same sentiment from previous visits. Very slow, orders get mixed up and it's close to impossible to grab a servers attention."}
{"text":"Like Starbucks, there seems to be a Thai restaurant on every corner.  Many are mediocre.  Sukho Thai stands out...it is excellent.  85 previous Yelpers can't be wrong!  ;-)  Try the Garlic Tofu...delish!"}
{"text":"After 3 years I finally ate here and I fell in love. I was so full but I didn't want to stop eating. Ha. The staff and service was great!"}
{"text":"My server informed me that the only differences in the regular pad thai and the Sukhothai pad thai are peanuts, lime and coriander, but I'm pretty sure the secret ingredient is crack.   I had only patronized the original location once and I haven't been back since I had a kid. But then I discovered that the new location has high chairs! My server was very accommodating to me and my child. The lunch time crowd, on the other hand, seemed to find it surprising to see a toddler in their midst. But around 12:30, the entire restaurant was pretty full and the noise was enough to drown out any toddler mewling. FYI parents: though there are high chairs, there is no change table in the bathroom.   I ordered a mango salad, a mild Sukhothai pad thai and a lemongrass iced tea. I'm still daydreaming about all the delicious flavours! Be wary if you're very sensitive to spiciness, as the mild pad thai still had a bit of a kick. Everything came to about $31 including tax and tip. The service was friendly and efficient, but the food was a bit slow to arrive. Hopefully that's just a new opening kink they will be able to work out."}
{"text":"It was as good as I expected it to be!!   I came here for my birthday and had 9 people in the group. Everyone got a different dish so that we could each try a bit of the menu!   The food is sooooo good! You can tell the ingredients they use are of high quality! And the way they make the flavours blend is just perfect! Also the food came out at a reasonable time.   The service was just ok. There was nothing wrong but they just weren't as enthusiastic about their job. But the food was too good so that didn't matter."}
{"text":"Love their food ....absolutely delicious !!! Their garlic chicken is always perfectly done. Tom Yum soup is an explosion of flavors !!!  Tom Kha Gai is equally good. My personal favorite is their Green Curry with fish. Not a great fan of their popular Pad Thai though...noodles were a bit dry and undercooked. I like their creamy Khao Soi and spicy Pad Kee Mao more. Their sour sweet Massaman curry is worth trying !!! Only two dessert options .... Cassava cake and Tapioca with coconut milk... Simple and good but nothing inspiring..........Not very impressed with the restaurant interiors. Crowded most of the times....Service can get bit confused and inattentive !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!   The Sukho Thai padthai is the most amazing padthai I have ever had! So authentic and delicious. The garlic tofu is heavenly! If a restaurant can make tofu taste so good, imagine what they can do with everything else!   One of the best kept secrets in Toronto!  It gets very busy on the weekend and it takes a while to find seats. I've been the Wellington location. Nicer decor, hip crowd, easier to find seats :)"}
{"text":"Rat Spotted.  You read correctly. A group of friends and I had just finished dinner when we saw a large Rat running around inside of the Wellington location. Though I've been here in the past and the food is good, I was very disappointed with the way they handled the situation. We spent about $80 + and left half our food (instead of packing it up) and all they did was offer us a $30 gift card!! We obviously will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant in Toronto! I have tried numerous Thai restaurants all over the GTA (only 2 being my favorite) and have always said not one restaurant can compete with any local restaurant in Thailand. However, the dishes here resemble the most to the food in Thailand in terms of its texture and taste.   I  usually get the Khao Soi, but since I have opted for vegetaranism I order their AMAZING Pad Thai. Their Pad Thai boosts of flavor, has the right amount of sauce and that close to perfect authentic chewy texture  (un-like those soggy, acidic orangey pasta you get at most chinese owned restaurants...yuck!)  I suggest coming here for lunch because it gets very packed during the evenings, so be prepared to wait longer than 15 minutes if you do."}
{"text":"Amazing khao soi, must try if you're a foodie. The service while they try to keep up is definitely lacking in terms of numbers and the servers can lag behind sometimes, not their fault but rather management needs to bring in more servers."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous customer service. The food kept us coming back, but that's not even enough anymore. We waited an hour and a half for our takeout, only to return home and half of the order was missing. We tried to call back, but since they are incapable of picking up a phone we had to walk back. The girl at the front was rude when we explained the problem. She just handed us the rest of the order without even apologizing. We have been a customer for 2 years on a weekly basis and will find a new Thai place in Toronto."}
{"text":"First review was a 4-star (probably overly generous then), and after reading all of my thoughts again from the first experience, I found that there haven't been improvements and I have the same complaints as the first go.   Khao Soi though tasty, but barely luke warm. We darn near sent it back, but since lunch was during work we didn't have the luxury of time.   My friend had the Pad Thai which was pretty good.   I had one of the specialty dishes \"Nua Gra Teaum\" which is stir-fried garlic beef with a fried egg on jasmine rice. This dish was no better than any beef dish found in a standard food court. In fact, had I went to the food court, I probably would have gotten something much better and for less than $14. The beef was lean, over cooked, and tasted of a poor quality cut... plain white jasmine rice and a regular fried egg. I was extremely disappointed with this dish. It was just not good, sadly.   Combine the lack luster meal with the 'status-quo' service received, it really doesn't feel like this place is trying. There is no focus to aim for great service here, nor quality of food. Based on that feeling I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered ubereats from this place, and just got the Tom yum soup starter because I was really feeling for some soup. At $6.50 for a small portion, this starter was ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH its price tag. At first sip, there's something off with the soup flavour. While Tom yums should be sour, sweet, tangy, and a mix of complex flavours, this straight up tasted like diluted ketchup. Although there were a variety of ingredients like peppers, mushrooms, shrimp, kaffir lime leaves, cilantro, etc., the off-putting flavour couldn't be saved. I felt ripped off and my soup cravings were not satisfied. :("}
{"text":"Tucked away in what use to be a house, this is the best Thai Food I have ever eaten. Ever.   Sukho Thai prides themselves in their authenticity (which I can't comment on never having been to Thailand) but what I can comment on is their food is phenomenal.  MUST ORDER:  Khao Soi - This is the most delicious dish I've had in months, no seriously, it was just divine. Creamy, rich, full of flavour, a little spicy, everything cooked to absolute perfection. I'm trying to figure out when I can get back to this place to order more. It's also a big portion so I have left overs in my fridge. Yeah! (Check out the pictures, it's the one in the tear drop shaped dish.)  ALSO GREAT:  Pad Kee Mao - This is a variation on Pad Thai (noodles, sauces, veggies) and it's absolutely delicious. The texture of everything was just right and unlike some Thai noodle dishes at other restaurants this was just packed full of flavour.   A note about the spiciness. Your options are Mild, Medium, Western Spicy, Thai Spicy. We nervously ordered the Pad Kee Mao 'Thai Spicy'. If you're a spice lover, don't shy away from this option, it was a nice kick without killing you.  No music, completely normal lighting, no windows in the basement, very standard service, nothing interesting on the walls...sometimes a great dining experience just comes down to great conversation paired with exceptional food. This is one of those places. No doubt in my mind, I will be back."}
{"text":"I've only been once but their pad thai and thai iced tea were delicious. I felt that portions were generous considering it's located in downtown (doesn't look like much from the picture but I had leftovers and had the rest for dinner). Ambience was nice, though it did feel a bit crowded. The pad thai was very flavourful and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this place authentic exactly, but the flavours are very good and ingredients pretty solid. Very consistent from month to month. Light on vegetables so more of a guilty pleasure after a long work day, or takeout for an indulgent TV night."}
{"text":"Had the pad Thai, green curry and mango salad here. It's okay, I've had better. The curry in particular was more creamy tasting and was lacking some spice, even though we had ordered medium spicy. Perhaps the spiciness levels were more catered to western tastes."}
{"text":"I really love their Sukhothai Pad thai. You must eat in. Although this is my go to thai food delivery place, it just doesn't taste the same when delivered- especially the pad thai.   The kao soi is superb here as well. Definitely one of my top 3 Thai restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Picture this, I'm sitting at home mid-day, mid-week, hungry and waiting for groceries to be delivered and realize I have nothing to eat. Realizing this I now begin the process of vetting the usual suspects for lunch time delivery (Pizza, Chinese, Swiss Chalet, etc). I then decide to check out UberEats and see what I can get delivered to my little corner of the world.  Success!  Not only do most places deliver to my door courtesy of UberEats but I can get Sukho Thai from their Dundas location. Score!  I was under the assumption it would only be 1-2 items available but it ended up being the full menu (or close to it). Knowing how much I enjoyed (and have been craving) the Khao Soi in the past at Khao san Road I went with that.  45 minutes later I met the driver in the lobby of my condo building and took my treasure upstairs. Nice thinking on behalf of the restaurant to keep the curry and beef in a separate container than the cooked noodles and the fried noodles. Upon arrival I merely had to re-assemble (Cooked noodles, curry/beef, topped with fried noodles) and I was having a restaurant quality lunch without having to contend with line ups or even leaving my house - this is the life!  My one suggestion (which I made to UberEats already) was that, despite their ebst efforts, my meal was slightly warmer than \"luke-warm\" and needed a jolt in the microwave. I think a temperature controlled cooler bag might have helped here, rather than the paper bag it was delivered in (looked nice but not practical when it takes 30 minutes to arrive).  No comments on the location itself but the food was tasty (and nicely spiced at the 'Spicy' level). I'll be ordering again - and soon  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"My friend was raving about Sukho Thai and so we decided to have our Friday dinner here. The restaurant atmosphere was very lively, people chit-chatting and having a good time.  We were seated fairly quickly considering we did not make reservations and it was  Friday night (around 8:30 pm).  I ordered the chicken curry with noodles and my friend ordered the spicy chicken curry with rice. Our food was delicious and the serving was quite large (I would say enough to share between 2 people). We also got the coconut tapioca dessert which is ABSOLUTELY delicious! Warm, coconut-y and just tasty!   The only downfall was our waiter. He ran off before we could complete our orders, thus having to order our drinks when he walked by our table again. He spilled water while pouring it in our glasses and my food was also spilled on the table when he transferred it in the take out container. Was not friendly and did the bare minimum.. sloppily.   This does NOT speak for their overall service though, as on my way out I asked a waitress for a bag to carry my container in. She put it in a bag for me, tied it up and even put it inside by purse for me so it would not fall! Absolute sweetheart!"}
{"text":"I was invited to a private party in one of their karaoke rooms. The service was great and the food was okay.  I really enjoyed the peanut butter chicken and crispy spinach."}
{"text":"It was not good. The pad thai was not flavourful. The masaman curry was not cooked enough, the potatos were hard, the beef was hard, and they used the cheapest cuts of stir-fry beef instead of hearty chunks of brisket. Everything was underwelming for me, Pai does every dish much better."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp!  I would have never known of this place had it not been for yelp.  This is possibly my favourite thai restaurant in Toronto - so far ...  We ordered the Tom Kha Gai - get the full entree size  - totally worth the extra few dollars.  Extremely delicious.  The coconut balances out the tartness of the tamirind (i think) soup base.  Trust me, its yummy!  Pad Kee Mao - my absolute favourite!!!!  the kind of dish you just want to wear sweat pants for and gorge on.  hmmm .... the chewy texture of the noodles, the spicy, the basil ... sooooo yummy!!!!  I would eat this every week if I could.  Khao Soi - quite tasty but I do not think I will be ordering this again.  The sauce was little too oily and rich tasting.    There is the option to upgrade your dish to include mango salad and a drink for an additional $2.  We did this with two of our dishes and I personally do not think its worth it.  The mango salad was just a little dish of pickled mango and other pickled veggies.    The restaurant is quite small.  I would make reservations.  We did not and had to wait about 20 minutes.  I do not think this place is handicap accessible.  There are a few steps leading into the restaurant  - I do not remember seeing a ramp ...  Left the restaurant with our coats infused with the food smells from the restaurant.  My husband complained that his coat still smelled 2 days after - even though he walks to work!    Great restaurant!  We will probably be back but will be ordering take out :)"}
{"text":"So we came here after the Jay's game and we were seated very quickly, there were a few open tables.  First time here based on Yelp reviews I had read.   I liked how clean the restaurant was but didn't like how close together the tables were. I couldn't really focus on the conversations at hand because everyone around me was so loud and distracting.   the server was okay, she was was kind of pushy and wanted us to order right away. she had no patience to answer questions or deal with coming back. I was pretty annoyed by that.  after we ordered she never came back to ask how things were going, I had to flag her down to order more; again I found that pretty rude.   When we asked for the bill, it was instructed to go to the front to pay. I know it was an honest mistake because I even asked my bf how much he tipped and he said the standard 15% for her doing her job. She came running over with the bill to say \"only 1% tip, wow\" - now I understand she was taken aback by it, but that reaction was just rude. when he apologized to say can we swipe my card again her response was \"you know that's not possible.\" we literally put whatever change we had together to leave her more of a tip but just the way she went about it was so uncalled for. One can blame it on culture; but the purpose of my rant is that it's not right.  ON to the food: it was delicious, I had the veggie pad thai with peanut sauce (extra 50 cents) and he had the chicken curry with noodles. food was full of flavour and presented very nicely. I even took my leftovers the next day and it was still as good."}
{"text":"Really delicious food with great service. We went on a busy night but the servers were calm and friendly. They recommended some great dishes to our table of 6, and we all really enjoyed our meal. The Khao Soi was by far the best dish. The sauce was creamy and there were lots of noodles and meat.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I want to say this is been one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever been to.  The food is very spicy and when I say spicy I mean spicy which is good for me :)"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Their signature house Sukho Pad Thai was bland, I had shrimp on the aide and it lacked seasoning.  The presentation was sloppy from what I expected from a place like this, it was like they just dumped it on a serving plate from a rice bowl.  The Chicken Gaeng Pnang was not bad, the chicken meat was tender and moist, but the portion was rather small.  The Thai Ice Tea was nice, but the entire glass was fill with ice right up to the rim.  In my opinion it's not worth the 30 min wait, but at least they take your number and call you instead of you having to wait there the entire time."}
{"text":"The food is disappointing especially if you've eaten at the one on Parliament.  The Pad Thai is sweet very few vegetables.  The curries nothing but cream.  Awful. I would not order from here again unless the food improves."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot but recently ordered Pad Ki Mao, Pad thai and Madsamum Gai and it was a disppointment.  The noodles were all stuck together, there were very few vegetables in the Pad Ki Mao, the Pad Thai was a bit on the sweet side and the Madsamum Gai was awful.  There were chunks of potato -- like almost half of a medium size potato! -- and the chicken was tasteless and the sauce thick and sugary sweet.  Don't know what is going on here but I wouldn't eat there again.  Paid almost $50 for food that was awful."}
{"text":"By far the tastiest pad thai I ever had in downtown TO! Will be coming back for the curry dishes, & another plate of pad thai (& another to go). Only complaint is the uneven floor where our table got a constant shaking as people walked by. Be prepared to expect a full house (about 8 tables if I remember correctly) come dinner time so if you can't wait, just order a take-out instead."}
{"text":"My friends took me here for my birthday and I absolutely loved it. The portions were a pretty good size, definitely had leftovers for the next day.   I would highly recommend this place to any one who is looking for good pad Thai."}
{"text":"Only ate here twice (fall of 2013 and summer 2015), but love it.  Dark, simple, modern atmosphere.  Friendly service.  Excellent food.  The Sukhothai Pad Thai: \"Our \"Sukh'ed up\", Northern Thai version of the Pad Thai is a must to try.  You will find a slightly different take on Pad Thai depending on where you are in Thailand.  This is a taste of our Chef's hometown goodness.  Extras:  made with peanuts, more herbs and a small-town, northern-style, authentic-Thai twist\" is perfect and I could eat it daily, the tofu version anyway.  This is differentiated from their regular pad thai, which is the same only without the peanuts, herbs and secret flavors.  I'm sure it's just as good, but I will stick with anything that is quote to have more flavor.  The spring rolls are pretty basic, but tasty.  Good portion sizes and you will be full.  Next time I'm in the city I will try a different dish though, which will probably be just as good."}
{"text":"Tried the Shrimp Pad Thai at lunch.  Shrimp was cooked nicely, however I was really looking for the layers of flavour in the pad thai, instead mainly tasting overwhelming sweetness.  To me, there wasn't the balance with ingredients that were in there.  I would not order this dish again."}
{"text":"Service is atrocious. This place is constantly understaffed (my third time with such an experience) but the food is good enough to keep coming back. No more!! Our poor waiter was servicing 10-12 tables on his own and was clearly not able to cope. We asked for hot sauce with our pad thai's which came after we finished eating. We ate our entire meal without water - took 15 minutes to get our glasses refilled. I berated the manager to no avail (whom I had to seek out on my own near the kitchen). She did absolutely nothing, didn't even bother to come speak with me or my folks. Never going back. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Haven't been back here for a year because the service was horrible the last few times I went last year, however, new renovation job, new servers has made a vast improvement in the overall atmosphere of Sukhothai first location!  I always used to tell myself I won't come back to a restaurant who had snobby and rude servers, but I couldn't get enough of the best Padthai I've ever had in toronto. The food is made with fresh herbs and ingredients. Kudos to the chefs who have mastered their craft. I love the shrimp Padthai med spicy, the curries, the khao soi...The garlic chicken as an app is amazing. Spring rolls is mediocre but mainly everything on the menu is freaking delish!!  The second location on Wellington is also great and has more room to host bigger parties but although the menu is the same, I find the food made in the first Location just better. I'm so happy that the restaurant has real servers who smiles when they take ur order rather then just be abrupt and rude.   This restaurant is a true gem.. Food was always amazing, and now they have great servers to go along with it. Let's just say I been good every week just because u truly can't get enough!!"}
{"text":"Rated R for obscene deliciousness.  Khao soi, with beef. Don't ask questions, just get it. This curry gave both my friend and I mind-blowing foodgasms, which we expressed with barely intelligible exclaimations of delight as we stuffed our faces. It was, dare I say it, even better than Khao San Road, last time I checked. And that, my friends, is no mean feat.  Pad Thai was also yummy. My friend declared it the best pad thai she'd ever had, but I think Khao San Road may have won that title for me.   The place is small and busy (of course), but the servers are friendly. It's nice enough for a simple date, but nothing fancy (and the neighbourhood is a wee bit sketch). Protip: they do actually take reservations, which I would strongly recommend unless you like waiting with smells from heaven's doors wafting under your nose.  I will be back when craving Khao Soi better than I could imagine."}
{"text":"Amazing Had the fresh shrimp spring rolls, red curry chicken, chicken pad thai, and mango sticky rice  this place is one of THE best thai places I've ever been to, if not the best."}
{"text":"If you can get a seat at Pai during dinner hours, I recommend coming here as a back up.  My party ordered the crispy spring rolls, chicken pad thai and the beef khao soi. The crispy spring rolls were a bit of a disappointment. It came with 3 and I thought the taste and flavour were just average. The khao soi was amazing. The soup base was definitely my favourite part of the dish. It complements with the noodles and beef very well. A must try if you come to Sukho Thai. The chicken pad thai was also great.  I definitely will come back and have some more of that khao soi next time."}
{"text":"Our visit was a major, major disappointment.   It may be telling that after airing our grievances with (who we assumed was) the manager, he agreed.   I don't know what his name is but the tall, silver-haired waiter was shockingly rude to us and for no apparent reason. Either because we were Asian or we were clearly gay but something had him set against us the moment we walked in the door.   Full disclosure: we were in a hurry to catch a movie so I was not exactly sending the most relaxed body language when I walked in but at the same time, as we walked in there were 3 empty tables and no one to seat us. I asked 3 separate people for a table and the tall guy stood behind me doing absolutely nothing (really, he wasn't even waiting tables) and told me to wait for a host.   After we were finally seated by the manager (friendly Asian guy with shaved head), the tall guy fastidiously ignored our table, not offering as much as water. Finally, I flagged him down to place our order and he dismissed me by saying \"I'll be right with you\" and took the order of the table beside us, even though they were still hemming and hawing about what to get.   As I said, we were in a rush. If we were to be served in a timely manner, we had no choice so we flagged down the manager again to place our order with minimal fuss. After that, perhaps because he was annoyed that we \"went above him\" to place our order, we never once heard from the tall guy again. He circled our seating area, filling waters for all the tables around us, making conversation and asking \"how is everything?\" in an apparent attempt to slap us in the face.   In the end, after an insulting dinner service, my partner asked the manager who was our actual waiter: him or the tall guy. It was the tall guy. We told him what happened and he seemed genuinely upset about our shoddy experience, apologizing and saying that they're ironing out the kinks. He said he had three tables walk out that same night because they simply weren't served. Pretty representative of the kind of service you'll get at the Wellington Sukhothai.   I'm only giving 2 stars instead of 1 because I feel for the manager and he was sincere with us. The nice decor and decent food don't really make up for this mess. To be fair, the rest of the wait staff that served us were fine but this blight on the wait staff at that location completely ruined our night. Sukhothai has the dubious honour of providing me with the most blatant and discriminatory dinner of my life."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai, I want to give you five stars, I really do. Your food is delicious and authentic, both spicy and tangy at the same time. Your owners are lovely and have orchestrated a great menu. But your service sucks, I hate to use that word, but its true. It really really sucks!  I was worried when I visited your restaurant and it took you 10 minutes just to come say hi. More perturbed when you forgot half of my meal and then didn't bring my drink...ever.  But the thing that makes it so hard for me to order from you again, is the 19; yep that's right 19; phone calls I made in one night trying to get some food. First to order (5 calls) , and then the additional 14 calls to find out where the fricking delivery driver was 2 hours later. Just a note, I never got thru in 14 tries.   This was my second experience trying to order for delivery, the first one ended in a drive that I took to see you which also ended in disappointment. Not only is it impossible to order from you, if I do in fact go in to sample your wares I can't get what I want because you are far too busy to make it.   As a restaurant I'm sure you are happy with your constant business, but take a hint from other business owners and hire an order-taker for crying out loud.  Otherwise I just can't buy from you anymore.  Let's face it, Thai restaurants in Toronto are a dime a dozen, and I will just take my order to elsewhere!  Bottom line...I'm taking an undetermined hiatus from this bustling Thai shack."}
{"text":"I met friends here for dinner and the food was delicious. I had mango juice and pad Thai with chicken and it did not disappoint. You receive large servings here so if you're looking for gourmet sizes ask for a half order. It's a casual atmosphere and the servers are very pleasant and approachable. Highly recommended for the Thai food fan!"}
{"text":"My visit here had some highs and lows.  Our server was very friendly but he seemed stretched rather thin.  When my entree came (gaeng panang beef with rice), I reminded him that i hadn't received my appetizer yet.  He apologized and went immediately back to the kitchen (whether this was his fault or the kitchen's fault, I can't say).  I had my tom kha gai soup during my meal which is something I found rather inconvenient but I will give them credit for their food as both my gaeng panang beef and tom kha gai soup were absolutely amazing.  Everything had layers of different flavours playing off of one another which made for a satisfying meal.  The tapioca dessert was also fantastic.  I'd be willing to come again in spite of the hiccups."}
{"text":"overall: for all of you out there looking for that awesome thai flavour experience, keep in mind that when you come here you might get it or you might not. This is because this is the sukho thai post renovation, redesigned, flavorless and inconsistent.For those giving it 5 stars, have not gone here enough to tell whether it is consistent or not. So my review below is on the new sukho thai (NSK), and a comparison to the old sukho thai (OSK) is drawn.   meal that I always get (30 plus times): khao soi, sukho thai pad thai  service: 3 ok, both for old and new the service is alright. I don`t really go here to be charmed anyways so this criteria carries very little weight in the overall rating.  food: 3 I always get khao soi and sukho thai pad thai. in the NSK world, the pad thai is lousy, no flavour and is a shadow of what it used to be. I cannot really figure out why, I think the sauce base has changed, the amount of cilantro is decreased, and little nuts. Khao soi has remained consistent throughout SKs, so that a plus.  price: 2 in OSK, the prices were still high considering the run down place and the ghetto location that you would have to treck to to get yoru food. so in the NSK world, this place has deteriorated the amount of value it brings per dollar since all the prices increased, so now you went from ok price and ghetto place, to higher price and better place, but the location is still ghetto. so overall its downhill in terms of value.  portion size: 4 about same portion OSK vs NSK, somewhat sizable.   bottom line: so basically, once in a while this place does the trick to satisfy tthe hai craving, but I will be on the lookout for other places to find the bold flavour for a better price!   maybe it has to do with the chef that keeps running from OSK to khao san road to sabai sabai... i dont know, but just stick to one place already and let us enjoy your food...."}
{"text":"Got take out from here for the first time, and we loved it.  There are few good Thai places in the city.  My wife would ask for Thai more often, but it had always ended in disappointment.  This time, she upped her game, made me drive further for this, and it's definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, but the service is, to be frank, sh**ty.  Had a reservation for a fairly large group. Big enough for Sukho Thai to want to tack 20% tip. Some people came a bit late, and they have a policy to not hold reservations unless everyone is present. I get where they're coming from, but it still leaves a negative impression, especially when they make your party of 9 cram into a space meant for 6 at most.   The server was not particularly friendly or trying to cater to our group. I guess when you're guaranteed 20% tip, you don't care about needing to work for it. He was absent a lot when we needed things, but he made sure to let us know about the mandatory 20% tipping policy even though we were stuffed into a tight space with little service in an area where we could barely hear he person sitting next to us.  Not sure where this mandatory tipping policy came from though, since minimum wage here is higher than in parts of the States where tips are necessary for a living. There are better food joints in the city that offer better service for the same price range and know how to cater to large groups.   Bottom line - good place for takeout, terrible for dining in. Experience was bad enough that I'm not likely going to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in toronto. The location isn't the best but it's worth the visit. I've never been disappointed. The spring rolls are perfect."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned by the negative reviews, but my husband and I were really tired and hungry after a long walk around this area, and we decided to give it a shot. We actually liked it alright. The Khao Soi was way too sweet for my taste, but the braised beef in it made up for it. The meat was deliciously tender and falling apart! The gaeng was good too. Service was surprisingly quick, despite how busy it was.  Tip: The wellington location and this location have waaay better ambiance than the Parliament St one. Frankly, I wouldn't take friends/family to the Parliament one. The prices are the same at all locations. I get the feeling the reason Parliament Sukho Thai has better reviews than the others is because it's the oldest one, and probably had significantly lower prices when those reviews and news articles were posted."}
{"text":"Me and the girlfriend were really craving some Thai food the other day and decided to try Sukhothai, based on the many great reviews we have seen.  Our experience was a mixed one, but ultimately Sukhothai was a very enjoyable experience.  We started with the garlic chicken which was good but nothing really to write home about. It just seemed very generic and plain.  The Sukhothai pad Thai was up next followed by Gaeng kiaw won (green curry)  and the Khao soi.  The Sukhothai pad Thai was delicious but I found it to be a bit to sweet for my liking, but overall very tasty....but I've had better in the city.  We both absolutely loved the Gaeng kiaw (green curry). The curry chicken was extremely tasty and paired really well with the rice it was served with, a really great comfort food dish. Next time I come back here (and there will be a next time) I will be a bit more adventurous and try this dish with a bit more \"heat\" as I found the level 2 (of 4) to be too mild for my liking.   The absolute highlight of the night for the both of us was the incredibly tasty/hearty/sinfully delicious Khao soi. I would recommend this dish to anyone coming to this restaurant. The sauce was so thick and flavourful and everything worked so well together. It definitely is a heavy dish best enjoyed shared and with with their great Thai iced teas.  The night wasn't full of positives, as the service left something to be desired. We waited an extremely long time for our food to arrive and the entire time waiting our server failed to check up on us to freshen our drinks or just to let us know that our food was close to being ready or what not.   I would never fault a place for bad service, because ultimately I'm there for the food... But this service experience was enough to knock an almost perfect night down a rung.   Sukhothai has great food that I would recommend to anyone who asked me for great Thai in the city... A definite must try to anyone looking."}
{"text":"sukho thai is a godsend for for people who keep it zabihah/halaal and are looking for something trendier and upscale.  not to mention the place doesn't break the bank.  4.5 stars and i'm rounding up.  food: most important aspect right?  *what i had* was great, and i had the yellow curry and chicken pad thai.  TONS of chicken (HALAAL chicken suckas!) and lots of potatoes.  a little light on the noodles, rice and sauce.  my friends and i chased it with tapioca pearls.  my friends are fans of that, me?  not so much.  but it was fine.  i was looking forward to a mug of thai iced tea but they said they were all out.  i died a little inside but thats okay, i'll get it the next time around.  i'm used to slightly bigger portion sizes in california but apparently that's the crux of america's obesity problem.  whatever.  the spice level picks up quickly so if you're an ABCD like me start with the mild.  overall this is a GREAT gastronomic thai experience short of an authentic thai meal.  and the only way to get THAT is to set aside substantial vacation time and air miles (anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar).  experience (crowd, location, atmosphere, service): i'm big on this.  and am willing to accept slightly less tasty food for a good experience.  and i had a great time here.  *ambiance/atmosphere*, the location is *uber* trendy with that exposed brick loft thing going on that i really like.  importantly they have lots of floor space so if there is a lineup you don't feel rushed or crushed.  the art is weird but its on sale so it likely changes on a regular basis.  lighting is a little dim but it varies so you can go for the romantic corner or the i-wanna-see-whats-on-my-plate.  lighting by the bar is blue.  bathrooms were clean and functional with cool fixtures.  lots of energy from all the people and the music (not intrusive or loud, but hip hop for some reason, out of place and not my first choice).   *crowd* is middle class/upper middle class, young, educated, professional, on a date or in groups of friends, dressed non-douche-bag trendy, and friendly.  not pretentious.  and lined up into the lobby.  so call ahead for reservations.  *service* probably the weakest aspect of the experience and it wasn't that bad.  they were slammed and our waiter was new.  food was a LITTLE slow coming out but it arrived hot and he kept my water up.  over-watch comes around to make sure we're happy and whip any nonperforming waiters.  back to experience: awesome.  the combination of all the above aspects leaves you with a great restaurant that is high energy (we went on a saturday night) with a cool crowd and good food and no bruised egos."}
{"text":"This small Thai restaurant is located on Parliament and just south of Dundas East. Walking in is a long narrow room lined with tables along each wall and 2 flat screen tv for those who like to eat & watch. I had the Pad Kee Mao, a noodles stir fry with beef, green peppers & basil, mmm delish. For $14 it was tasty and satisfied my hunger. Will definitely come back and try their Khao Soi."}
{"text":"Very small little restaurant, but delicious food. I almost always get the khao soi with chicken at medium spice level. It's AMAZING.  Only wish their hours were a bit more flexible."}
{"text":"Sad to see this place only has 3 stars because it's the bomb! Did I just say that, what year is this 2002? Anyways I had a great meal here and I will for sure be back.  I went out of my \" always go for yellow curry\" comfort zone and went with the Gaeng Masaman and I'm glad I did. Really full of flavor and so much food. I didn't even finish it and that's very unlike me.  The decor/atmosphere is really great too. Cozy and classy all at the same time.     There are three locations to choose from and if you're near any of them totally check them out! ( or order in because who really wants to leave their house)"}
{"text":"About Delivery:  First off -- my girlfriend and I are in love with the dish named 'Khao Soi'.  This coconut milk, yellow curry, noodles dish with choice of Braised Beef or other (of which we don't even consider besides beef because of how good it is) is simply amazing.  Best of all is how they handled it for delivery. I didn't think they would do a good job of taking care of this dish but they even separated the cooked noodle and dried noodle with the beef and curry in another dish. This is love love and attention to detail!  Do not hesitate to order delivery from this location..  Top Notch Food."}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing and spot on, they have a few items on the menu but they do those items right. Today I had the beef khao soi usually I'm a pad thai kind of guy and tend to stay away from the curries but today I was feeling adventurous, and damn did I make a good choice. The curry was very hearty and rich just the way I like it and it had a very subtle and refreshing hint of coconut milk, not too overpowering but just enough to help subdue the heat of the curry just a bit. The beef was cooked to my liking not too well done but also not to rare (which you don't want in a hearty meal like this). I just wish they would of cut the beef mutton into just a little bit smaller pieces, as sometimes I was ripping them apart with my hands. The food here is always great and fresh tasting and the staff are always so kind, even though they sometimes tend to forget about the customers as they are talking amongst themselves, but I don't waiting a little while enjoying the nice pictures of exotic Thailand they have on the wall. My only drawback is I wish the menu was a bit bigger, I understand the concept of having a smaller menu and doing those few dishes right, but I just wish there was a bit more to order off of. All in all this place is a great hidden gem in the beautifully revitealizating community of Regent Park and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Okay...so I've reviewed Sukho Thai with 1 star and a review saying I will never go back.  Um, I have been back a number of times since and while the service is absolutely horrible (not unfriendly, just totally devoid of customer service).  The food is really good if you can get it for take out.  Plan on waiting twice the time they suggest."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying, Thai food is usually not my first choice. However, a friend of mine brought me here in the spring and I've been here 2 more times since (and will continue to go).  The first time I went I ordered the Sukho Pad Thai. It's a more flavourful version of the original pad thai. I always order chicken and tofu. There is a $2 charge for that, which I don't mind.  They have 4 different heat levels and I ordered a medium. I throughly enjoyed it!  When my cousin visited from the UK I brought her here. We ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer dish which I found a bit too greasy for my liking but the dipping sauce was nice and hot with red chilli pepper flakes. I had been craving the Sukho Pad Thai so I ordered it hot this time. The waiter convinced me to go Sukho Hot. Although I can handle heat in my food, I was hesitant. He said it is not too hot. When the food came, I took a couple of bites and I was in tears. There were bits of freshly chopped red chilli peppers mixed in with the noodles. It was UNBEARABLE. I didn't want to take it back so I ordered a new one but asked for medium. The waiter didn't even offer to take it off the bill out of courtesy even though I was willing to pay for both.  Needless to say, I wasn't happy on my second venture there.  I hit the jackpot the third time I went (food wise). My friend had made a reservation for 16 for 8:30 pm. We didn't get seated until 9:30 pm because the people who had our table sat around talking well after they were finished their food. We know that you can't ask people to leave but they didn't even bring out their bill to expedite the process. Most of us didn't mind standing around chatting and catching up but the music was very loud and we were straining our voices trying to have a conversation.  When we were finally seated,  I wanted to try something different so I ordered the Nua Gra Teaum which is garlicky beef on a bed of rice served with a fried egg. OH MY! It was delicious. Two of my friends also ordered the same thing and they loved it too! In my mind, you can't go wrong with love egg in anything. It was a mild dish with hot sauce on the side. I would definitely go back for it."}
{"text":"Ordered the tofu sukho pad, chicken gaeng panang, and garlic shrimp appetizer. The portions are fairly decent sized. Shared two mains and one appetizer between three people and it was just filling enough. First time at sukho thai and the workers are very friendly and food came in a timely manner. Would definitely come back to this restaurant to try the rest of the menu. Also really liked the vibe as it can accommodate families, big groups, and also intimate dinners. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of Thai food, save and except two dishes: Tom Yum Kung and Green Curry. Even then, I never thought anyone did justice to these dishes.    Enter SukhoThai. Two people, in love, with one goal: to \"make real Thai food\".  Halleluiah.     I heard the buzz (and there's a lot of it) a while ago, but forgot about it - life's been busy.  Course destiny had it that I went this past weekend. A random phone call from one of my favourite friends led to a happy gathering of hungry faces at this downtown joint. The place is small, but cute, and although it was busy, service was attentive.   Sukho Thai lived up to its reputation and then some. This family-run restaurant is friendly, and the food is outrageously good.    We sat, we ordered and we gorged...a lot. Six mouths ate two orders of shrimp chips with tamarind dip (greaseless shrimp chips...chomp chomp), two orders of spring rolls with sweet and sour garlic sauce, three curries, one noodle, one special, and of course, my absolute FAVOURITE, Tom Yum Kung.      Tom YUMMMMY Kang This soup is a winner.   Gone are the days I say \"I hate Thai food\", so long as it's Sukho Thai."}
{"text":"Tried this place and loved it ! Service was right  spot on quick to the table but didn't rush you. The beer selection was good and the draft super cold. The food was delicious, try the shrimp. Nothing in this place wasn't fresh. We had a nice time . Atmosphere was fun and buzzing. Go early or be prepared to wait ; it's worth it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a good review, but our experience wasn't the best. The two stars are for the food, but service was horrible.   Keep in mind:  - Tables of 6 and over cannot split the bill, and a 17% gratuity is added. - This place is super popular, but medium sized. If you come at peak hours (7PM) there will be crowding and quite a long wait. You might have to wait on the stairs.  - Try to call earlier in the day to reserve a table, especially if you're in a big group!   Service: Made a reservation for 7PM. When we arrived, we were told we would've seated in a few minutes as they were setting up our table. 20 minutes pass, and we ask for a status update, in which the hostess apologized and said it wouldn't be too much later. At 7:40, we were seated. After another half hour, a waiter came to take our orders. Another 40 minutes later, our food arrived. It took almost an hour and a half for us to finally get our food, which really dampened the mood as my group had been waiting all day to eat at this place! My experience was almost identical a previous Yelper's review of the service. Two tables beside us were seated, served, and left before we had finished our meals. The waiter ignored us and didn't check up on us at all, or come over to take our order! We had to flag him down every time!! We were really put off by the 17% gratuity because it was not deserved at all but paid anyway as it was getting so late and we needed to catch our trains home.   Food: The dishes were great, and I wish we didn't have to wait so long to finally get our meals. I ordered the chicken Pad Thai with mild spice, and it was absolutely delicious. I also ordered a thai tea, which was the perfect mix of sweet and creamy. The calamari was delicious, and my friend's curried noodle soup was beautiful - a balanced blend of spice and creaminess.   Tldr: service was so slow (1.5 hr wait until we got our food), waiter ignored us, but the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"When the parliament location scared the bejesus out of me I trekked to this wellington location instead. I was seated after a short wait to a open window in the middle of scorching summer heat. No A/C but I really didn't mind. It was nice but would prefer a fan at least. Loved the window seating and the food was great. I really liked how authentic the food was and my thai specialist friend even said it was just it would be back home. The price point is good value and service was quick and the staff were friendly. I really recommend this place over Khao San Road. Where the latter is over hyped, Sukho Thai is a gem."}
{"text":"Worth a visit. Choices I've enjoyed have been: Phad Thai, veggie stir fry with beef, chicken tenders, spring rolls and traditional Thai tea. All of which were delicious.   The service is fast, fresh and cooked perfectly! The flavours are complex and spicy if you ask for medium.   If your ordering Uber delivery it can be a bit pricey, but take-out and eat in are both great deals for the quality."}
{"text":"Went here on a late Wednesday evening for dinner as a group of 3, it was moderately busy but we were seated right the way. However service was a bit slow and it took quite some time for the server to get to my table. On to the food! My group and I ordered the garlic chicken nuggets, hicken Pad Thai, Beef Khao Soi, Lemon Grass Fish and Thai Iced Tea. I would say the food was more than enough and it was shared amongst us comfortably. My favourite dishes had to be the Garlic Chicken Nuggets as they were delicious and crispy and the Chicken Pad Thai. The other two dishes weren't quite my taste but my friends loved them, except for the lemongrass fish we regretted getting it as it had an odd sour taste. I would definitely recommend going easy on the ice for the Thai Iced Tea to avoid a watered down flavour as the ice melts. Overall, I would definitely come back here for the Garlic Chicken Nuggets and the Chicken Pad Thai"}
{"text":"Garbage food. Garbage place. Tacky as hell, poor service by owner-operators. The place should probably be visited by a safety inspector. If you enjoyed Asian buffets of the 80s then this place will transport you right back."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai has been a takeout staple for me during my time in Toronto. They do inexpensive, uncomplicated Thai food that's really tasty. I always order the same thing: the house Pad Thai (probably the best pad thai I've had in Toronto, it certainly destroys Thai Express, etc., and comes in a big portion) with some spring rolls and the delicious red curry with squash and tofu for the girlfriend. It has never disappointed! If you order your dishes on the spicy side (they will ask you how you prefer each dish to be spiced) expect a real kick in the mouth. The actual physical restaurant is nothing to write home about: it's small and spartan and tucked away down a grimy stretch of Parliament. But they do make some delicious food!"}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai and vegetable green curry. The Green Curry was horrible!!  It tasted nothing like cu MN green curry.. Was watery and not enough vegetable milk. Only had 2-3 pieces of tofu and times of butternut squash.  No other vegetable.  Safe yourself some grief.. don't go there."}
{"text":"After having made two failed attempts at getting food from here, I finally found success with my third time.  The first time, they didn't deliver as far as Leslie and the second time, we attempted to get take out on a Saturday night. It would've taken over an hour to get the food so we opted for Thai To Go. I mapped out a plan to pick up my food right after work. Around 5:30, you have a better chance of getting your food right away. I ordered the garlic tofu appetizer and the pad kee mao.  The garlic tofu appetizers were a bit of a letdown. I was hoping for more crispiness but it was just breaded tofu and they only give a tiny little container of sauce to accompany it which isn't enough. At $8, you'd expect at least a larger container of dipping sauce. After eating the garlic tofu, I was pretty full so this meal had to be eaten in two parts. The pad kee mao was a little on the dry side though the noodles weren't overcooked so it made for a good reheat meal.  The dry nature is pretty much my only complaint. The dish itself tasted good although I think I overkilled it with the garlic tofu so i couldn't handle any more tofu in my dish. Next time, I'll go for the spring rolls. It's not the cheapest thai food (garlic tofu and pad kee mao came to about $21) but I'd be willing to give it another chance (if I'm strategic in my visiting plans)."}
{"text":"Tied for the best downtown Thai (with Salad King). My favourite off-menu dish to order are the Fresh Rolls with shrimp. Fresh and tasty, it comes with an amazing peanut sauce that will keep you ordering it again and again."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in downtown last Sat and went to Sukho Thai. We actually picked this place by Yelp reviews (thanks Vincent) and they were right on. The food was really good, we shared Pad Thai and Red Curry and loved both. I think it was one of the best Pad Thais I have ever had! It was very tasty and rich in flavours.  I was trying to decide between 4 and 5 stars and finally decided on 4 because of very slow service - though the place was packed so they were quite busy..."}
{"text":"Want a bad Thai experience, then this place is for you. With only a 3.5 star rating meaning 70% of their customers are not happy. Everyone knows less than 4 stars and look out, don't expect much. I don't seem to learn. Even at the best of times the service here is bad and I keep coming back in hopes it gets better. Now, I know I won't be back because they switched there chicken to pieces from China. The quality is way down, the service has never been worse and the waitress laughed at me when I complained about waiting 30 minutes between 2 dishes (her words \"everyone has to wait, not just you\" BITCH!).  Sukho Thai once owned the market on Thai. Then the service got bad and they were still able to hold on because the food was good. Now that they switched suppliers for their chicken, no reason to come back here at all!  Portion sizes at this location is much smaller as well. Success is when you think you are so good your customers won't notice the quality change. WRONG. Soon they will be so desperate I expect they will be hosting Yelp events. That's how you know the writing is on the wall and they are going down.  I have never been so insulted in my entire life. Good luck with the Distillery location, you are going to need it.  I WILL NOT BE BACK TO THIS LOCATION and if they switched the supplier at the other location then I am done with this place."}
{"text":"As the price continues to climb and this becomes one of the more expensive thai houses the quality, service and food continues to fall. I was a regular and would come once or twice a week, now I only drop in ever few months in hopes that it will satisfy me the way it once did, and of course it doesn't. Still busy running off its past reputation. I use to love the red chicken curry, now it is mostly liquid and very little substance, they only serve white rice with no options. They discontinued the free wifi which can be important. I prefer no wifi in fine dining establishments, in run of the mill places like this, I depend on it and will have lunch in places that offer it. It's a shame to see good places die, this one is have a long drawn out death simply because it use to be one of the best."}
{"text":"At a friend's house for movie night last week, he introduced me to this Thai joint. We decided on delivery so we looked online at what they had to offer. The menu itself if a real gem. There are many visuals and the website is clean and concise (not the usual overwhelming feeling I often get from delivery menus)  I would normally order Chicken with my pad thai but I decided to venture outside my comfort zone and tried the beef with medium spice.   Let's just say that It was a definite treat for my taste sensations.  I would definitely recommend giving this place a go. I highly doubt you will be disappointed"}
{"text":"Top-notch pad thai, khao soi, and curries! Definitely one of the best thai restaurants in the city - and best of all, they take reservations (*cough* Khao San Road *cough*)."}
{"text":"Best thai food in the city. Thought I wasn't a fan of thai food until I ate here. Wouldn't go anywhere else for thai. Everything we've tried has been delicious. Pretty much the only place I eat at every time I'm downtown. Khao Soi and garlic chicken are incredible. Best pad thai I've had."}
{"text":"The food, which really matters the most, is simply stellar.  Consistent, tasty and fresh every single time... some of the best I've had for sure.  I don't LOVE their spring rolls, other than that, the mains are to die for.   Problem is they simply haven't dealt well with becoming the talk of the town.  Very slow service, unaccommodating attitudes, and at times down right irresponsible in the way they answer (or don't answer) their phones, close the doors at one location without telling pickup orderers this fact on the phone...that sort of crap.  We frequently order from this place at work and we love the food so much we put up with it, but be prepared to be disappointed by the overall service.  They do make up for it in great strides with the food though, so 4 stars it is!"}
{"text":"I used to love Sukhothai and go there all the time. It was so delicious and pretty affordable. The quality has TANKED in the past six months. The food I used to get is now unrecognizable - way overcooked rice, three pieces of chicken in the curry. It's so sad - it was one of my favourite places in the city and honestly the food is pretty gross now."}
{"text":"Sukho thai is one of my go to places in the downtown Toronto region for thai food. I came here on a weekday around 6:30 pm and there was about a 25 min wait for a party of two.   We ordered the garlic chicken and sukho thai pad thai with chicken and mild spice level to share.  The portions were decent and the service was attentive but not overbearing. I've been here quite a few times and I would definitely recommended it."}
{"text":"I'd say this is one of the better work day lunch locations.  Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity you get.  The lunch choices are only $1 less so you might as well go for the full portion though.  Pad Thai was my regular go to dish, never goes wrong.  Green curry was good but I never get enough rice to be full lol..."}
{"text":"Came around 2:30 pm on Saturday.  Only one or two other tables with patrons, others the place was empty.  The good: interesting location.  Will do well there, no real strong Thai competition.  Bathrooms were so nice!!  No wait.    The okay: service was good but very obviously new.  They ran out of Thai Iced Tea:( when we were there - seems like something you shouldn't run out of.  They brought out food but not really good serving bowls that made sense, despite us asking.    The food was okay but now with the competition market for Thai food, and the expectations attached to the Sukho Thai name, I think Pai is way, way more interesting and varied in their dishes.  That being said, again, if you're in that neighbourhood, not a terrible choice.  I wouldn't go back though, mostly likely, because it is very far for me.    N.B. Shrimp fresh rolls were VERY good."}
{"text":"Heard so many great things about Sukho Thai. So tonight I went and ordered takeout for my family. Was told 10 to 20 minutes. Ended up waiting 50. Then they tried to make me pay for someone else's more expensive order. After much confusion, finally, they found my order sitting behind the counter. Who knows how long it had been there? And... in the end I paid full price. I was expecting maybe a discount or free dish or something, but no. The Pad Thai was awesome. The Khao Soi was supposed to be mild but was so spicy it was almost inedible. Said mild on the receipt so...   All around, not great experience."}
{"text":"Not sure where to order from, I got on Yelp and found Sukho Thai... Pretty good reviews, and boy do I love thai food...  We placed our order at 5...  At 8:15 it arrived. So late. We were so hungry. It took so long.  But to be honest, when we tasted it- we didn't care anymore... It could have arrived an hour later, and the truth is, it's amazing.  The Pad thai was awesome- we got spicy, and it was perfect. So was the red curry. Oh wow awesome. So ya, it takes a long time- but seriously, good things come to those who wait."}
{"text":"What great food! After coming back from a month in Thailand, I have been sorely disappointed with Toronto Thai restaurants. Pad thai with Ketchup, and nothing interesting on the menu.  Sukho thai had great Pad Thai that is the real thing. The Khao Soy is amazing (a regional favourite in Chiang Mai)...and I have been dying to have it since I got home.  I'll be back again and again to make sure I try the entire menu. If you want real thai food come here.  At the advice of the other reviewers we got a reservation, made for a good meal with no waiting in line...the wait came in waiting for the food to arrive ...but well worth it when it did."}
{"text":"One of the better thai food options in the city.    Extra star because it's halal and there's so few really good halal options.   Their pad Thai is probably my favourite in the city and I really like all their curries and the garlic shrimp.   Also a great location to take kids, I've taken my two nephews who are 5 and another that's 10 and they are great at accommodating.   Overall, lovely experience and it's definitely on my rosters of take out or good cheap eats"}
{"text":"The food here is always great. My go to's are the garlic chicken, veggie fresh spring rolls, chicken pad thai (Thai spicy), and steamed rice to cool my mouth. It's always good (omg, I have to knock wood).  Its always good. The chef is always ON. we're never disappointed with the food and I'm sure I've ordered from here more than 10 times. This is unheard of. I don't want to jinx it *crossed fingers*. Amazing food. It's a small cozy spot you should definitely try :)"}
{"text":"What took us so long to come back to the original location?  This place looks waaay better than before and they've really maximized the use of space.    We ordered two noodle dishes and the spring rolls.  All dishes came out within a short period of time.  Delicious.    I think I need the fried chicken and the papaya salad next time!"}
{"text":"really good, authentic Thai...after years of lamenting the Thai food situation in Toronto, I am happy to say that Sukho Thai is now on my favourites list...having traveled in Thailand I can say that this is the closest I have had in North America...if you love Thai food, go there."}
{"text":"Came here in the summer for Thai with friends. Everything was fresh , well spiced and delicious. Worth a visit !"}
{"text":"Heard there was a new thai restaurant in the neighbourhood and since I love thai food I went there today for the first time with two other friends for a late lunch.  Initial impression from walking in the restaurant was that it seemed like a young, relaxed environment- darkly lit with reggae music playing loudly. We were immediately greeted by friendly staff and seated at a great table in front of the large open windows which overlook Wellington Street.  I ordered a standard Pad-Thai with chicken. My friends ordered the Curry of the Day and Tofu Stir-fry.   My Pad-Thai was very sweet and overly saucy -tasting nothing like Pad-Thai.  My friend's curry of the day was uneventful and the tofu stir fry was basically vegetables in a bowl of broth. (It went uneaten).  When the waiter came by to collect our plates he didn't ask why my friend hadn't touched his stir fry, or much less if we had enjoyed our food or if we needed water, another drink.... anything?! Minutes later he was sitting at the bar himself!   More time had passed and finally another staff member came to our table to ask if we needed more water- at which time we asked for our bill. When he returned with the bill it - we were charged for the uneaten stir fry. It was explained that my friend hadn't eaten his stir fry and that our waiter hadn't questioned why he was returning a full bowl of uneaten food to the kitchen.... and to top it off, be charged for it. The staff member apologized for not knowing about what had happened. We never did see our original waiter again.   The whole experience was disappointing. If the service was better I would consider giving it another chance but considering we were practically the only customers there at 2:30 in the afternoon - I doubt it would be much better at dinner."}
{"text":"Came here with my good friend Tarim a and we had a nice time. This was some quality Thai food. I read this is the sister resto from khao san road which is pretty cool. They both are quality Thai good for decent pricing. The portion was big and there was enough for leftovers too. Beer pricing is quite fair. Very relaxed atmosphere, and nice music selection, it's overall a nice night out for a quick bite but note to come when your not rushed just because it wasn't the fastest service in the world but everyone was super nice and friendly. If definitely come back."}
{"text":"You know when u decide to try a new spot than regret it? If so you should know how I'm feeling right now, if not go try out this spot called restaurant. I would love to come eat here again with Gordon Ramsay see what he thinks. The only good thing about this place was the waiter super cool guy. The decoration of the place gave me memories of high school when I tried mushrooms for the first time cause I'm confused the inside feels like a mix of Narnia and Enchanted Forrest heading to see the Wizard of Oz. Anyhow don't go in there's a Harvey's not to far from here you're better off there."}
{"text":"Was meeting a friend who lives right near here and so decided to grab a bit before meeting up.  Have never been in the space but it's unassuming from street level.    Huge points off for atmosphere and decor.  It's almost like cafeteria style feel, but with restaurant style prices? Hard to explain. Chairs were falling apart, tables were shitty quality.  Noise level so loud that we were seated at the bar but we couldn't hear the bartender at all.  Water served in plastic glasses.  Tacky overall.  Food presentation is also like a cafeteria; food slung on plain white plates with no care or thought into what it looks like.  No chopsticks; fork and spoon (but for all guests, regardless of race, luckily).    Food was good, average enough that I'd return if I was in the neighbourhood but wouldn't make a separate/specific trip.  Pad thai has two choices - tofu or vegetable - tofu comes with no vegetables so we ordered vegetable version.  Came piping hot and continued at that temperature throughout the meal.  Basil chicken was good but not enough basil, just a few leaves.  Shrimp cold rolls didn't match their dipping sauce well...I prefer a dark sauce, not a peanut sauce, for my dipping.  Neighborhood joint only."}
{"text":"I had  popped in here on my way home from work the other night to pick up a pad thai, i just didn;t feel like cooking and i was in the mood for Pad Thai.   Sukho Thai was strongly suggested by friends at work as one of their favourite Thai places, and since my favourite Thai place had closed (chef retired :(... ) i was on the look out for a replacement.  This place did not let me down, i had the house pad thai \"Sukhothai Pad Thai pad thai\", the pad thai was superb, it was almost like the pad thai i had in Phuket. very fresh, very tasty. The wait time was a little long though, and i was just left to mill about the front of the restaurant while i waited,  but overall i'll return for more take out and likley some dine in visits.   My only concern was that their food is fairly highly priced for Thai food, for one Sukho thai Pad Thai Pad Thai cost me just about $16 after tax.... where as most places charge round $9 or $10 plus taxes.. so be prepared to pay a premium for some good thai food."}
{"text":"If you love the Sukho Thai or Khan San Road food than you love the new Sukho Thai, why? Because it tastes just the same!  Been here twice since it opened couple of weeks ago. We get our usually faves, Kai Soi Beef and Pad Thai. Both times the Kai Soi Beef was super amazing with tender beef chucks and plenty of it. Sauce was creamy with the crunchy dried noodles. Pad Thai has always been good. Last time we tried a potato curry dish but I forgot what it was called. It came with rich and it was really good as well.   We also ordered the Kai Soi Chicken and my issue is that it came with too much chicken and not enough noodles. Some might say that's a good thing.  I had higher expectations for this location because it's their 3rd location and should have enough experience to have a more complete ambiance, the place is nice but missing the design touches from a professional designer. It was designed by Jeff's brother. We mentioned that it felt really cold because the overuse of dull black/dark grey and metallic silver. Jeff said they are working on that.   As well the service wasn't on point because everyone was new there. They have uniforms now and think they will improve in time.   Tip: If you come after 10pm you can feel and hear the bass on the floor from Reservoir Lounge. Maybe sit on the west side of the restaurant? This place is still busy at that time.  Overall it's a really good experience and love that it's in an area I frequent often. Will be coming here often until it gets busy with lineups like the other locations, and it will get to that point soon!"}
{"text":"This is officially the best Thai food place in Toronto. This is sooo good. I always get the Khao Soi which is made to perfection. Crispy fried noodles on top of creamy coconut beef stew.. mmm..... I prefer to go when they are not busy because when they are busy, they are really busy!  I also get the Thai ice tea too. It's extra good because I rarely have sugar in my diet. yummy!   It's small with few tables that gets really cold during the winter time. But they have a downstairs. Not great but the food more than compensates for it. What really good is the price. Nothing beats it."}
{"text":"The most overhyped thai restaurant in Toronto. No, seriously. There's line ups if you go on a weekend, you have to book a reservation or you will be waiting for hours for a table. Uber eats also delivers this - so they are busy from that sense too. Word of advise - if you're hungry and can't wait 1-2 hours for your food, skip this.   So I got the pad thai. Which was OK. It wasn't bad, but it was pretty much on par with any other pad thai I've had.. and sometimes at half the cost. The one thing I did like here though was the Thai Iced Tea - if you haven't tried this, you have to! It's delicious and would be the only reason I'd stop by here again."}
{"text":"Been here many times now, excellent food overall and very good value. Their pad thai is truly special."}
{"text":"Dinner on Wednesday July 8 @ 8pm. Great food. A bit pricey for cheap ingredients. Service was the biggest problem but there is not much you can do to fix that until management realizes how to properly staff a busy restaurant. I chatted with my server Paul after paying my bill asking to speak to the manager.  A party of two who ordered multiple selections of each section of the menu plus wine. The server wasn't able to suggest or recommend anything and when questioned I was dismissed as he was busy with a party of 20 behind us. The issue was after completing dessert we sat for 30 minutes waiting for someone to recognize use despite using hand gestures and subtle methods. It was not Paul's fault but my experience was completely ruined after the hype this place has received. Paul offered to comp some of my bill after paying but I was not complaining to get something for free. Food is always good but the experience is key. FAIL for me."}
{"text":"It's a great atmosphere to have lunch or dinner with friends and family! It's clean and waiter is friendly. food is good as well as the music! They bring the classics back :)"}
{"text":"Went here early on a Friday night.  They weren't busy at the time so we got a table immediately.  We started with shrimp chips and fresh shrimp rolls to start.  The shrimp chips came in a big bowl which was big enough to share with 4 people.  The chips were okay but  the tamarind sauce was great.  The fresh shrimp rolls were okay, nothing special.  What blew me away was the Khao Soi.  It's an absolutely delicious noodle dish in a creamy,  soup-like, curry sauce. The flavors blended well together.   I thought they could have put more chicken though.  Overall,  I would go back for this dish."}
{"text":"I really really really liked Sukho Thai. I had lunch here by myself at the bar and the service was great. I ordered the small size Tom Yum Soup which was super spicy and amazing. The little bowl had 2 shrimp in it and lots of veggies, mushrooms and chilies.  The Pad Thai is similar to that at Khao San Road-- very good. Me likeee!!  I would give them 5 stars, but I'm still very sore that they don't deliver to my area. It's actually not that far away-- most people could walk it in less than 15 minutes. If they start delivering to the south end of Bathurst St, I'll give them a 5."}
{"text":"What? Just tried to order delivery to King and Bathurst (only about 10 blocks from the Wellington St location) and they only deliver as far as Peter Street! BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FACTOR!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. Still my favorite Thai in Toronto after many years. The Tom Kha Gai, Khao Soi, Green and red curry are all great."}
{"text":"The food is sooo delicious!! I got the khao soi with shrimp, spicy  and I also tried the gaeng masaman with chicken. Both were so good! The shrimp was great, but the chicken was amazing! It was moist and just didn't have that \"chewy\" taste at all! It came with these crispy noodles on top that added a great texture. They are creamy, spicy and just the perfect meal for a cold winter day!"}
{"text":"The ambience here was great. I liked it better than its sister location at parliament. It was roomy and spacious. They had great 80s music playing. Our server was Liam and he was fantastic, an absolute delight to speak with. The food was great too. We had the shrimp chips, sukho pad thai and the green curry and they were all delicious. The red curry was not as great. Overall great experience. Will definitely return to have Liam wait on us again."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday night but were seated right away. We ordered the mango salad, pad Thai and Khao soi and all three were delicious. The food, atmosphere and service were all top notch but the best part was the company."}
{"text":"One of our takeout indulgences. The food is delicious and consistently good. The prices seem a little high, but that never seems to deter our repeat cravings.   Takeout can take a while from ordering to readiness, but they've always been ready when promised. Phone lines can get jammed, so recommend the app if you have access."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had!! Everything is amazing here. My absolute favorites are guaytiaw sukhothai, sukhothai pad thai, khao soi, and their tapioca with coconut milk!! Delivery is super slow and so is the service but the food makes up for it all."}
{"text":"I would rate this an easy 4 out 5 but...  *It took  over 40 min to get our orders (2of us.) *I didn't particularly enjoy the type or volume of the music.   It drowned out most of the conversation.   *awkward waiting area:you're pretty much standing next to seated patrons waiting for a seat.   Uncomfortable  for both parties."}
{"text":"This is a casual place that serves authentic, traditional food quickly. It is owned by the same people who own the successful Thai restaurant on Duncan and King. My sole complaint about this place is that their spice levels can be inconsistent, and each chef will interpret what you mean by mild, medium, hot, and very hot differently. For me this is a non-issue since I eat practically all levels of spice. But someone who is sensitive to spice might be a little resentful."}
{"text":"Had the chicken curry. Very good flavor. Wait staff actually talked me out of a side dish and weren't the friendliest but food was really good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I like it :) I came here for the first time yesterday evening to break my fast with two friends. Popular place during Ramadan, which is totally understandable as I wouldn't know of another halal thai place around the city. The ambiance is vibrant and lively, the decor homely and not overdone. The service was a bit inconsistent - two of the servers gave us somewhat dissonant messages about when we should come sit in order to have our food at the precise time we needed, but I'd forgive that easily because once we were seated a new waitress who took care of us for the night was really friendly and wonderful!   Food was great - I had the Khao Soi (an orange coconut-based curry with rice noodles and fried noodles on top) which I found really tasty. The only thing about the dish I didn't particularly enjoy was the meat, which I thought was served in really large chunks and wasn't especially tasty (to be fair, I'm not much of a carnivore to begin with..). My friends ordered the pad thai (really, really good - nice and sticky with lots of peanuty sauce, which I dig) and a Massaman(?) curry which, somewhat unusually, pairs beef with a tamarind-y sauce but works! I would recommend my dish or the pad thai as both are extremely flavourful. Beware, though, the portions are enormous (though they might not look it). Would love to come back here to try the Sukho Thai pad thai later!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed by their pad Thai.. one of the worst I have had.. lacks flavor and beef tastes like rubber.. I ordered though UberEATS so I don't know if in store it's different but won't be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"The most chaotic, slow stressful dining experience. We ordered take out and showed up at the time told, and it wasn't ready for another 30 minutes on top of that. No explanation, no apologies. The food is good but not worth the overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Went back again, service was great, got the right food and it was hot this time. : )  Guess we just got a bad night, I'm glad to update this with 4 stars. Removed one star because it just isn't the best value (that still goes to Khao San Road over Sukhothai!)."}
{"text":"Previously my favourite Thai restaurant (hands-down) in Toronto, and possibly my favourite restaurant period. Unfortunately, ever since they started doing Uber Eats, their quality has gone drastically down to just average. It's still good, but there are dozens of good Thai restaurants in the city. The consistency of the dishes is lacking, and quality seems to have gone down overall. Just visit the restaurant one evening, and pay attention to how many bags of Uber Eats deliveries the push out. There is no way a small kitchen like that can handle that kind of volume without deteriorating in quality. If you're in the area, it's worth a visit and it is definitely enjoyable. But I would not go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. SukhoThai is my absolute favourite restaurant in Toronto, hands down. As a relatively new appreciator of Thai food, I can safely say that the wonderful chefs of SukhoThai had a lot to do with my new-found love of this cuisine. I tell everyone about this place and have yet to hear one negative review about it from anyone I know.   Let's start with the original venue: Sure, the Parliament location is in a neighbourhood that not too many people would like to venture to, but it's still very conveniently located for anyone in the downtown core/any TTC users. Patience is key when you arrive, but believe me, you will be so greatly rewarded for the long-ish wait times. In fact, I often luck out and get a table right away. The key is to avoid peak dining times. Get in either super early or a little later (9ish). I disagree with all the negative posts about the service. I always find the original staff to be very friendly and attentive, even when the restaurant is packed. The food is of course amazing (yum) and sure, the venue is small, but it feels like home.   The new Wellington location: This is even more conveniently located for the downtown folks and I've heard can accommodate around 100 people. I had to try it on the first day it was open and was a little disappointed to see that it was pretty empty. Granted, it was a Monday night, and not everyone is as SukhoThai-obsessed as I am (note: I also went again a few days later and the place was almost packed). The new venue is definitely \"swankier\" but I do miss the cozy atmosphere of the original restaurant. I'm hoping the Parliament renovations aren't too extensive! I was happy to see the original staff at the new venue, but I must say that I'm not too big of a fan of some of the newer staff, (maybe I'm biased?) some of whom acted as if they had better things to do than wait tables. As a non-drinker, the liquor license doesn't really affect me, but I'm worried that the bar at the new location (kind of lounge-like) might add a bit of pretentiousness to the down-to-earth restaurant I so love. The prices have gone up a bit at the new Wellington location (and will remain the same once the Parliament location reopens) but for the amount of (delicious) food you get, the new prices are still absolutely worth it.   Now the most important part - the food: I think I might have tried almost everything on the menu at some point, but I do have my favourites.   1) The SukhoThai Pad Thai is a must. Our group will always order at least one chicken ST PadThai (medium spice) for the table to share. The tamarind adds a wonderful complexity to a dish that is often done so wrong by other restaurants. 2) Massaman Curry (chicken, medium spice). Sweet, oniony, peanuty deliciousness.  That is all. 3) Khao Soi (BEEF, medium spice). There's no other way to go with this but to order beef. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't order it that way. The meat is so tender and just melts in your mouth. This is such a beautiful dish, with so many textures and flavours that just seem to work together. Tender beef, smooth curry, crunchy and soft noodles. My mouth is so happy when I have this dish. 4) Panang Curry (chicken, medium spice). If you like basil, this is a must. Again, so much flavour in this simple dish. A definite must-try. 5) Appetizers: crunchy (and non-oily) Shrimp Chips (with the best tamarind dip I have ever tried), Garlic Tofu (and I don't even usually like tofu) which melts in your mouth, flavourful Shrimp Fresh Rolls (with a delicious red curry-infused peanut sauce)  6) Dessert: if they have the Cassava Cake, you must try it. It's warm, somewhat spongey (in a good way), and deliciously coconuty. I also just tried the Tapioca in Coconut Milk and that also had a really nice flavour and texture.   So, if you took the time to read this essay, hopefully you're excited to try out this gem of a restaurant. It's definitely a culinary experience you don't want to miss! I'm partial to the unpretentious original venue and staff, but I did still enjoy my experiences at the new location. Make sure you try it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was packed! Although the restaurant was full, our wait for a table was only 30 min. Usually when I eat Thai food i play it safe and order pad thai. This time I took a risk and tried the Khao Soi curry gravy noodles and i was blown away!! The \"gravy\" is so smooth and luscious with all the great flavours of thai curry. The chicken in the dish was poached and sooooo moist and succulent. the only thing i didnt love about the dish were the egg crunchy sticks on top, they were okay but in my opinion there were too many. The dish was filling so we didnt order dessert but im sure I will find myself back there with more friends so I can try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Best Massaman Curry I've had in at least seven years. Crunchy, complex, thick sauce and well proportioned serving.  Friendly family-run restaurant, teenage waiters (sons?) dawdling at cash register talking w each other & young woman cashier. Has unmistakable happy atmosphere - laughter in the kitchen, easeful conversations between staff. The cashier just jogged into the kitchen giggling and saying, \"oh my God...\"  Nice low-maintenance decor, a bit noisy. Good quality food served in a sweet atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied with the food at both locations, though I tend to order the same combination of dishes every time. Favourite Dishes: Tom Yum Soup, Vegetarian Fresh Rolls, Gaeng Phed (Red Squash Curry) and Pad Thai. Try the chili oil that they make in house, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Understaffed.  There was nobody to greet us when we arrived.  Otherwise, amazing food - the best Thai in Toronto by far and we tried multiple Thai restaurants.    Fresh vegetables, tasty curries that dreams are made of, and dishes specialized to patrons.  I still crave the Panang.  For some reason the Thai spiciness scale in Toronto is much lower than NJ.  I asked for the absolute highest spiciness in each restaurant and received the equivalent of maybe a 6 out of 10 in NJ.  Must be the metric conversion.  The shrimp summer rolls were light and fresh."}
{"text":"I've come to this location several times and the food has never been disappointing. My usual go to dish is the massaman curry, but I've pretty much tried everything on the menu and my new favourites are the pad kee mao and green curry. My last visit I had the khao soi and it was so creamy and flavourful. The noodles were just the right amount of chew and the perfect addition to this dish. I wasn't a huge fan of the crispy egg noodle on top, but I can see how egg lovers would like it. It literally tastes like egg yoke. There was also a ton of beef in this dish which was soft and fell apart as soon as I took a bite. My husband ordered the pad thai which was perfectly cooked. It wasn't too dry or saucy and just the right amount of sweet and sour. My brother in law ordered the nua gra teaum which was this garlicky beef cooked in a sweet sort of soy sauce. I tried a bite and it was delicious and he thoroughly enjoyed it. As other yelpers have mentioned, service is really a hit or miss. I can't tell if the poor service is due to management, but in one of my previous visits, I've seen the manager yell at one of our servers right in front of everyone. It was embarrassing and we couldn't wait to get out of there. Other than that one time, I haven't had much to complain about in terms of service. This place will continue to be a go to lunch spot."}
{"text":"Situé dans le Centropolis, ce restaurant semble changé de propriétaire régulièrement. Je fut surpris lors ma dernière visite de vour une table d'hôte italienne. La différence de la qualité de la nourriture entre ma première visite (il y a 18 mois) et ma dernière était malheureusement très grande. La qualité des ingrédients, la cuisson n'était la du tout satisfaisante. Le service aussi est laborieux car nous ne comprenions pas plus le serveur que lui nous comprenais. Finalement, on ajoute les prix élevé et on a la recette parfaite pour que je raye cet établissement de ma liste."}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets in Toronto--tastes like you're back in Chiang Mai. Tofu & veggie pad thai is delicious, but word of warning, portions are huge. Green Curry is as good as it gets. You can also ask to make certain dishes vegan :) (& leave out the fish sauce)."}
{"text":"Got here on a Sunday night, and oh were we hungry.  We ordered our food, and it took over an hour to show up.  The food was amazing, I got a Khao Soi with Beef spicy, and it was the perfect blend of heat without losing flavor.  The only reason I wouldn't give them a 4 or 5 star is due to the length of time it took for the food to show up."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night without making reservation, my husband and i had to wait for about 30 minutes before we were finnaly getting our seats. Foods were very tasty, we tried beef khao soi and chicken pad kee mao. Staffs are friendly. We had seen many people come with children and family too. Great atmosphere, too bad it's on a little pricier side."}
{"text":"Foods we ordered: Khao Soi with Beef, Tom Kha Gai and  Gaeng Kiaw Wan (green curry) with tofu. Khao Soi and the soup were really good. Very flavourful and the soup was really appetizing. Green curry was not bad but not as intense in flavour. Very casual atmosphere and good for friends hangout."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai is a staple in the community. It's solid portions and pricing make it very affordable for the quality of Thai that you're getting. I always get the pad Thai here with medium spice, it's the perfect amount for me. It is definitely a top 3 Thai spot in the city and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Such a bad experience..  I understand that waiting happens when you don't have a reservation at Friday night. However we waited more than 45 minutes while the waiter told us it would take only 15 minutes. It was obviously understaffed (or not well trained), and it took 15 minutes to have the table set. The restaurant was half empty when we finally got to order, but we waited more than 30 minutes before the food was served.   Food quality was poor as compared to other Thai restaurant in the city . Panang curry was watery and plain, much worse than I tried at Khao San Road. The salmon was over-cooked. Massaman curry was really really sweet. Khao soi was ok."}
{"text":"Omnomnom.  Order the Pad Thai and Tom Kha Gai.  They taste like happiness."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here, and you won't be disappointed, but perhaps not the best either. The place is extremely well appointed, and unfortunately I think we end up paying a little more because of the decor. I had a pretty traditional Thai dish, which was presented plainly but well enough, and was spiced just about as I would have expected (in terms of heat) from the number of chilies appearing next to the name of the dish on the menu, so order with confidence. The beer selection is sorely lacking, but the wine list seems to be OK. This might be a good place to go before you catch a movie at Colossus; pricey date, but it's the ambiance, you know.."}
{"text":"Fabulous Thai food including northern dishes typically not found in other restaurants, you may have to fly to the Land of Smiles to find better ones.    The original location is great for take-out; this one makes a nice dine-in spot.    Khao Soi is THE dish to order here, so many flavour buds dancing harmoniously on the tongue.  If you can take the heat, order it \"Thai spicy\".    Tom Yum soup is another not-to-miss, aside from tasting delicious it purportedly has immune-boosting benefits.  I'd be happy to drink a gallon.    I am getting hungry just thinking about their food."}
{"text":"Just, YES. Everything about this resto since inception has been nothing but amazing. I don't know what I was eating before this restaurant when it comes to Thai food, but this is the real deal! Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"The original location! Although it's located in a sketchy part of Toronto, this location has so much character! I think it says a lot about authenticity that the owners of this successful franchise have maintained this original location over the years!   The ambiance is charming interior, quieter than it's other locations, and good service! It is a MUST!   And, the FOOD is TOP NOTCH! (obviously!)  Ps. Don't forget dessert!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Probably the best Thai I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"After looking for great Thai in the city for a while, I read about Sukhothai and when we went to try it, Sukhothai definitely lived up to the hype.  Everything was flavourful, crispy, with totally great portion size.  The place was a bit loud, otherwise it would be 5/5.  Everything we had was delicious.  And they deliver!  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"So yummy. But also getting so pricey and long lines. Hard to swallow such a price increase when Thailand is so so cheap.  Everything is good except for massaman curry."}
{"text":"I could literally walk by this place a million times without taking any real notice of it.  I was brought there for a lunch date by a colleague and boy am I glad he took me there! It's small but adorable, and yummmy!! I like thai a lot, but I've never had an incredible Thai experience.  I didn't have one at this place either but it was really solid, and there were appetizers I hadn't ever seen or tried at other Thai places. It's slightly more expensive than other Thai places I have been to, but I wasn't paying so it's okay! :)  I wouldn't say it's the best Thai I've ever had, but I'd say it's definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is location! If you work in the core financial district of Toronto, it's hard to find a good Thai place that's within walking distance and can get you back to work in time (whether it's lunch or dinner...for those folks who work long hours).   I don't think it's as good as Khao San Road or Pai, but you can usually get a seat decently quick, it's close to the core and it's still amazing! Their pad thai is what I usually order when it comes to noodles, because they don't have pad see ew, which is easily my favourite Thai noodle dish ever.   It might just be me, but I think their spice levels are less intense than other Thai places. If you're a frequenter of the other 2 restaurants in Toronto, you should probably level up here."}
{"text":"Impressed with everything I've had, I think this is one of the better Thai restaurants, maybe among the best. I've been here three times, and every time I can say It was great. I'd say I've really tasted some really fresh, complex tastes here. Best in the area for sure, among my top 3 Thai in Toronto. I may have to give this place 5 stars after trying more of their food. Lemongrass tea was lovely.   Definitely keen to go back here, and would recommend this place to people."}
{"text":"No doubt the food here was great. I tried the pad thai and khao soi, both of which were extremely flavourful and aromatic. The pad thai was stir-fried in a delicious nutty and savoury sauce, while the khao soi was swimming in a creamy and rich \"curry gravy\" broth.  My only critique is that their price point was a tad higher than other downtown Thai restaurants. As such, the $15+ dishes were proportionally larger than a \"regular portion size\" and I find that to be a struggle for the average eater. Do you force yourself to finish everything and suffer from heartburn? ... or do you pack it to-go but hate yourself for having to lug it around with you for the rest of the day? I personally have a strong dislike for restaurants who \"encourage overeating\" by only offering larger-than-normal portion sizes..   All in all, I want to give this place a 3.5 for the food but I'll round it up since I was delighted by how attentive and polite the service was."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious thai food!  Only downside is the location, not really convenient for parking and it's not close to a subway station so you have to take a streetcar."}
{"text":"it's a tiny place. very family like. they only have few veg options but the menu in general is short. Both my friend and I found that curries don't have enough veggies in them. my friend's order was chicken curry and there were only few bits of carrots and greens, mine was tofu/potatoes curry - which was mostly tofu. still yummy and the sauce is delicious but a bit more veggies would be good to have. they offer a cool thai tea - cold ice tea with milk and condensed milk. it's very very sweet but an interesting experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food, affordable prices and great atmosphere! Try the Tom Yum soup, it's straight from Thailand"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a few of my friends, and my friends heard about this place from their friends so we finally tried it out.  The food was amazing!  Everything tasted just a little more creamier than other thai places so it gave it that super yum flavour.  It's a small low key place that looks like they do a lot of delivery as opposed to dine in, so don't expect a fancy sit down experience.  We had the Spring Rolls, Khao Soi, Sukho Thai Pad Thai, and the Red Curry -- all totally delicious.  What I like best is their menu is compact, there isn't a gazillion things to have to choose from, they just have a handful of things that they perfected.  Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Came with a large group for Monday evening. We had reservations and got our table right away even though we arrived early. Luckily we made reservations as the place filled up quick.   I ordered the Thai iced tea and the Khao Soi with beef. The Thai iced tea was really good. I was very hesitant to order the Khao Soi as I have tried it at Khao San Road and did not like it. But I'm sooo glad I did. It was amazing! They gave a lot of tender beef, and the curry was nice and rich. I cannot wait to go back! Too bad they don't make Basil Beef (Pad Kra Pow). The service was great and our waitress was very friendly.  Unfortunately, the restaurant was pretty hot that day. There was not enough AC and eating spicy food did not help.  An issue I encountered there was my girlfriend and I both asked for our leftovers to be packed up - the male worker was nice enough to offer to pack it for us even though we just asked them for boxes (we both got the Khao Soi). I knew I had more noodles left and she had more curry left. When he handed them back to us, we double checked ourselves, and it was definitely switched by the worker by accident...  Also, they charge 18% gratuity since the table had over 8 people. I definitely agree with this and don't mind this at all. However, I think it would have been more respectful if the waitress would have mentioned that when giving the bill - or when giving the machine to whoever was paying."}
{"text":"We scouted out bar seating, as the wait for a table exceeded thirty minutes.   The drinks were great, lychee martini flavoured cocktails.  We had a green curry with chicken and a red curry with beef.   Both dishes were flavourful and tasted very fresh.   Price tag exceeded what I would normally pay for thai in a bar, but I am going to blame the $$$ on the location and the brand name of this restaurant and the reputation it carries.   Would go again."}
{"text":"My favourite place to eat Thai food in Canada. The food quality is amazing and the serving is great ( I'm a big guy who eats a lot!).  I've taken countless friends and family to this restaurant and not once I've had a bad experience (Food wise).  The food is very reasonably priced, entree ranging from $14 to $20. I've tried everything on the menu by now and each item is fantastic. My favourite is the chicken pad Thai, my brothers favourite is the beef pad Thai, sisters favourite is the garlic beef, moms favourite is the green curry chicken and dads favourite is the panang shrimp curry.  I usually get my food Thai spicy. It's a good amount of spice but not as much as Pai.    The pad Thai and the Khoi soi are to die for."}
{"text":"Went here Thursday night and it was quite packed.  The restaurant was quite loud so keep this in mind. Makes it a bit difficult sometimes to converse but great energy!   Despite this, we were seated very quickly. The service I would say is not very personable but they get the job done.   We ordered the Khao Soi with chicken, medium spicy (my favourite) and the Masaman Curry, mild.   The Khao Soi had a lot more 'curry' flavour than I've had before in this specific dish, where coconut milk seems to be the star. But I dig it! The portion was also good, great meat to carb ratio. One thing however I found a little off putting was that it was not very hot when it arrived. Definitely warm, but it gave me the impression my food had been sitting there a while before I received it or maybe its not that fresh...  I've never had Masaman curry before so I cannot compare it to anything but it was a really interesting taste. Much tangier than any other curry I've ever had. The sweet and sourness makes the meal feel a lot lighter. I thought the portion for this dish however was on the smaller side. And similar to the Khao Soi, it was not very hot.   Overall GREAT flavours, fine service, and prices are more or less on par with other Thai places downtown."}
{"text":"Ill start off by saying the food here is incredible. Definitely the best Thai in the city. Pad Thai and curries are all on point and very authentic.   The service however, is lacklustre. I base this on repeatedly being disappointed by staff who are seemingly annoyed and not very detail oriented. Wrong dishes brought to the table, then corrected, drinks forgotten, no check-in to see that we're enjoying our food. That is all to say that I go back for the food and ignore the service since I now know what to expect. It would be great to see them make improvements with their staff."}
{"text":"We normally come here for their Chicken and rice noodle soup and sautéed beef in garlic sauce with a side of fried egg. The restaurant is busiest on weekends with a line outside some times.   Food quality is decent to excellent specially for the dishes mentioned above . We have tried menu out of our regular and have always found them to be more of a disappointment then any thing else.  In general the restaurant is very clean with clean restrooms and cordial staff.  Type of crowd is younger demographic from downtown area and at instances can be loud with loud music playing in the background.  Taste of food rated good to excellent taste in music is bar style for the younger early 20s crowd."}
{"text":"I came here with automatic comparisons to Pai, my favourite Thai restaurant in the city. I'm happy to say, this is comparable and definitely a good alternative.   I asked some people who had been before what their recommendations were: they said not to get the pad thai, but get the pad kee mao and panang curry - both were amazing!  The pad kee mao is comparable to Pai's pad thai noodles, and the panang curry was nice :)   The only downside to this was a bit slower service, but otherwise I'm happy to come back or order take out via uber eats or whatever other delivery service will do.  Definitely a recommendation!"}
{"text":"Great place! Not too big and not too small, very cozy and clean. Food is easily one of the best thai in Toronto. And that Pad Thai is so delicious!  Good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and appetizers:)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place as I love Thai food but it was really disappointing. The pad Thai was really fishy tasting and the basil beef wasn't really flavorful."}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel that my Yelp addiction works against me.  Sometimes when I hear so many good things about something, it builds my expectations up to an impossible level of deliciousness.  Or at least that's what I tell myself when I'm slightly let down by a dish that's received raves.  Not because it's bad, but because it wasn't as amazing as I was expecting.  This has happened many times over, and I've noticed that the people I bring with me to these restaurants usually enjoy the food more than me - because of those darned unrealistic expectations.    Sukho Thai's Khao Soi was my latest victim.  Delivery probably wasn't the best option.  But we were just far enough from the restaurant on a frigid evening that I didn't want to make the trek.  We were told it would be an hour wait, which was fine.  I started to worry though when my boyfriend had to spell Front St for the person taking our order.  Luckily, it (along with the house Pad Thai and three spring rolls) arrived in just over an hour.    It was good, it was tasty, it was flavourful.  But it didn't knock my socks off, and after reading so many reviewers comment that this particular dish is one of the best things they've eaten all year - I was a little disappointed.  Maybe it's because I had it delivered - maybe I put it together wrong.  I did add the crunchy bits before I poured on the curry which made them a bit soggy.  I think it would have been better with that crunchy texture.    The pad thai was good, as were the spring rolls, but again weren't exceptional.  All in all, it was a very tasty Thai meal, but unfortunately my expectations were set a little too high so I'm going to definitely try it again with more realistic expectations.  I feel like I'm going to have to keep watch over my shoulder at the next Elite event...I'm nervous of the repercussions of this review."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for a while now, I finally got the opportunity to pay this place a visit.  As you can see it's highly touted by yelpers and \"the elites\" alike, but when a good foodie friend (a writer, who'd be a great contributor to Yelp! *wink wink*) of mine suggested coming here I bit at the chance.  I am truly happy that an establishment like this is located across the street from the infamous Toronto project, Regent Park.  It's one block away from my old stomping grounds where I spent the first 10 years of my life and never would I have imagined voluntarily coming around here to eat, more or less get some terrific authentic and unique Thai food.  My family spent most of those years working hard to try and get out of this place, and now I was back.  That's like going to Compton or south side Chicago to grab a bite.  For better or worse (much better in my opinion), the Park is changing and gone are the days of the awful run down red bricked low rises.  The gentrification process has officially begun.  Although brand spanking new high rises are in it's place, the neighbourhood is still gritty and very obviously working class.  So what does this have to do with the food?  The fact that this place is pulling in Yelpers and patrons who obviously don't live in this neck of the woods to \"da hood\" says it all.  Not only are they coming here, they're willing to line up and wait outside where back in the day, this stretch of street was notorious for a car jacking (an incident about 10 years ago right in front of this place), gun shots and drug deals.  Those days now seem long gone, and the only drug here is a bang on my palette, and at the risk of causing even greater line ups, I'd recommend you take a shot here."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer to sukoThai. My colleagues and I order from this place 1-2 times every two weeks. I'm a big fan of the family establishing a respectable Thai restaurant. I've got to say I don't feel the same way about the new location on Wellington. I would have rather eaten at McDonalds last night than at the new Suko Thai.  1) The service was subpar. The servers made us feel as if they were doing us a favour by serving us. The previous location had wonderful service it was like coming home to a family meal. This new spot felt like inexperienced servers who were pushing you through an empty restaurant.  2) We had an issue with the food and apparently the wait staff was afraid of the kitchen. Their response to \"this food is not good\" was \"let me talk to the chef and see what he can do\". At any reputable restaurant this would not have been an issue. Even after we returned food (uneaten) to the kitchen we only got $2 off our bill.  3) The food tasted awful. I got the Pad Thai and it tasted like ketchup. I've had this dish so many times here that I was insulted to receive such terrible food. Regulars of the previous restaurant beware - the spice levels are also different than the previous location.  Lets hope this place shapes up. Disappointed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Let me get this straight. I've been a huge fan of Sukho Thai and have long been spreading the gospels of the amazing food.    On a monday evening, I'm craving  sukho thai again! (yes, these do happen often). The Pad thai was excellent as is the Panang curry.   The shrimp chips, however.... The shrimp chips used to be $2, then it went up to $3, then $4, and now it's $5! The portion has since halved and they only give you one half fulled tamarind sauce. Which, to be honest, the price of this is mostly going to the sauce. Are you expecting your customers to be economical about the way they dip the chip into the sauce?   I'm writing this while my shrimp chips are hanging out drying themselves hoping to be eaten some day."}
{"text":"With toronto being such a huge destination for food now it's hard to not walk by a thai resto in downtown toronto. We just so happen to be in the st lawerence area and thought to try this raving restaurant.  Coming in at prime time on a Saturday night, we had to wait approximately 10 minutes. Service seemed to be quick and server's were popping dishes out quickly.  Got our seat and immediately was asked to order. We split the calamari and the shrimp spring roll. Both were good but stingy in portion size considering the price. Shrimp spring rolls came out hot and was mainly filled with shrimp meat. Calamari size is a little smaller for 10$.. It came with 2 different sides (one a fish sauce and the other a pickled veg).   My sister and I ordered the khao Soi which is basically a yellow curry broth with egg noodles and crunchy egg noodles and your side of protein. Both of us got beef and found that it was super rough and not tender at all. Usually in chinese cooking you use this meat while slow cooking the tendon... But it was overly rough and not that great. Hubby got the pad thai spicy and it definitely did not come spicy... So the server had to bring chilli oil out and he said after it was good.  We also got the thai iced tea and that was a little too sweet for my liking but still tasty.  Overall I've had better thai food before but the service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"After reading other people's reviews on this restaurant, it is safe to say that it is pretty inconsistant.  So if you want to experience it to the fullest, you have to go try it yourself. I personnally loved the service: quick, kind, always there and didn't forget a single thing! The restaurant wasn't full, so maybe that may enter in consideration.  The menu is very appealing and I had a tough time choosing what I wanted. I finally chose the salmon and bok choy and it was delightful!  Even the overall vibe was soothing and nor too bright, nor too dim and the style of seats and the booth are comfortable and clean.  I would come here again with friends, that is for sure!"}
{"text":"1. As others have experienced, the service is pleasant, but slow. It took a while to be acknowledged after being seated and at least another half hour for the starter soup tom yum kung to arrive. We weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a big deal but it was to the point that we wondered if they had forgotten us altogether. The restaurant was quite full when we were seated and half empty by the time we got our appys.  2. I got the khao soi which had incredibly rich and tasty curry gravy. But the chunks of beef were really dry. I would have gladly traded the beef for more noodles to soak up that glorious sauce!   Overall, decent, though I really wanted to love the food since it looked great and the prices are reasonable for the area. Damn!"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday October 17, 2009.  Smallish place that seats about 14 people comfortably.  Tastefully done, not spectacular, but comfortable.    The female matriarch/owner was not there, but her son and his wife, along with other friendly staff of family and friends were.  We dined in and after an initial wait of about 20 minutes, we were not disappointed with our choices.  The 3 spring rolls were fresh, light, and tasty.  Not dripping in oil.  About 15 minutes later the Shrimp Pad Thai was the best I've ever eaten in Toronto.  An extra squirt of a lime was all that was needed to wolf down the sizable portion in short order.  No complaints about the serving size.  My partner had the Pad Kee Moo and was delighted with the taste of flavors and the size of the serving.  We also had the Goeng Kiow Wan, which was a curried coconut taste sensation (comes with sticky rice).  We were so full we had to get a doggy bag.  Overall, we were impressed with Sukho Thai!  We will be back, but next time we will call ahead to pre-order if we're going to dine in.  They deliver too.  \"Kop Koon\" (means \"Thanks\" in Thai) Sukho Thai!"}
{"text":"Love the food at The Parliment location, and food here is just as good. The Gaeng Garee and Sukothai Pad Thai is absolutely the best in town.  Dare I say better than the current Khao San Road (now that Nuit does not cook there anymore).  The Wellington location is more spacious and good for larger parties."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are big fans of the Parliament location. Since it is currently closed for renovations we tried their now location on wellington last night. Unfortunately after the experience I must say I am a bit disappointed.  As usual we had the penag curry which tasted great however it was accompanied by a very small side of rice that was cold. The spring rolls also seemed to be wrapped in a wonton like pastry instead of the typical phyllo pasty. I prefer the ladder.   Finally, it took six phone calls and a hang up to finally get someone to take my order not to mention that it was 7pm and they next delivery time was 9:20pm! Luckily I live close by and did takeout instead.   I can't wait for the Parliament location to open back up! Hurry up Jan 18th."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and consistently so: I've been here with family and friends over and over, and the food is always on point.   The food: Haven't had a bad dish yet! Get the Khao Soi for something rich and sweet (the beef is super tender); the basil fried rice for a simpler, flavourful dinner; or panang curry...  The good: - delish food - fun, buzzing atmosphere  The not so good: - busy, hard [read, almost impossible] to get a last minute table (no reservations) - slow service overall *redeemed on my last visit by an awesome younger guy serving us.   Overall a reliable place for Thai eats with deep flavour."}
{"text":"I've been to the Wellington location of Sukhothai but not this one.  As a matter of fact, I didn't even know Sukhothai had expanded so much in the recent years to now have four locations in the GTA!  Wow, great job, Nuit and Jeff!      Luckily, G had called ahead of time to reserve us a table because even though it was only a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was packed when we walked in.  To my surprise, it was a much smaller location than the Wellington one.  There were 8 to 10 people waiting for a table when we walked in.  We waited about 10 minutes before we received a table which wasn't too bad and I was grateful that we had called ahead of time to reserve a table.  I chose the Pad Thai with just veggies and not the usual chicken or tofu or shrimp or beef.  The portion was big!  The peanuts were served on the side.  I already knew that I wasn't going to finish the entire dish.  The noodles had a slight sweet and sour taste characteristic of Pad Thai.  T had Lemongrass Fish.  We tried a piece of the fish and it was very nicely fried and crispy!  I was impressed with the size of the fish too."}
{"text":"Like previous reviews, I have very mixed feelings with this place. The food here is decent, not exceptional. The slow service and the unhappy staff, however, make it difficult for me to return.   Food: Khao Soi is your must order dish if you can only try one. It's their most popular dish and it's the best return for your money. The flavor is rich and the crispy wonton strips add another layer of texture to savour the soup sauce. The sauce itself is slightly on the mild side for its spice. Interesting presentation with the crispy wonton strips but the large oil drops really turned me off from wanting to dive into the soup. I had to stir it quite a bit before wanting to taste it.   Shrimp is a key ingredient used in many of Sukho Thai's dishes. We only found out about this because my colleague is allergic to it and could not order any of their curries, soups, pad thai, or even fried rice. If you have shellfish/seafood/shrimp allergy, this is not the restaurant for you.   Service: Always make a reservation before you come or you will end up waiting at least 30-45minutes. Even with reservation, be prepared to wait half an hour for them to make the food and serve it to you. I came with a group of 7 people (myself included), for our group reservation at 12noon. We got here around 11:50 and the food did not come till after 12:20. Also had similar experience another time when I came in a slightly larger group size. I think if you want faster service, come here in smaller groups.   Aside from waiting for the food, it's also really hard to get the attention of their staff for ordering, for water or more beverages, and for bills. They did not look happy to be there and when we asked for clarification on the food due to my colleague's allergy, most did not know. Finally the manager came and was shouting (yes the environment is pretty noisy too) that most food contained shrimp. He even suggested for my colleague to go order from somewhere else.    Price: Their price is slightly higher. With large groups, they automatically charge a 17-18% gratuity fee. My last group meal was charged with 17% and I've also had 18% gratuity for a group larger than 8. I don't really understand this gratuity fee structure but it seems like you have to pay a lot to and wait a lot to come eat thai food. On top of this, they use a system that does not split bills. Bring exact change if you are coming in groups.   Sukho Thai means Dawn of Happiness. Hmm...I think I'll find my food happiness somewhere else."}
{"text":"My hubby insisted he wanted Asian cuisine in downtown Toronto so we did a random pick after some reviews.   Parking on the street was not as congested as expected as the location is a little off from the heart of downtown, which works out perfect for my preference.   We had the Sukhothai pad Thai noodle with shrimp and medium spicy, Tom yum soup starter size and green curry chicken with rice.... Which turns out to have take home portions  as a lunch meal.   Price: very reasonable  Size: Enough Taste: better than standard Ambiance: clean and modern"}
{"text":"Food was very greasy last night (similar to Manchuwok mall style). And the service was nonexistent - the food was dumped, server MIA, and towards the end had to wait forever to ask someone for the bill. Hopefully this was a just a bad night."}
{"text":"Waiter seemed rushed even though it wasn't that busy. The food was great. I had their signature dish: KHAO SOI with shrimp. It was pretty good but wish there were more shrimp and smaller medium sized ones. We asked for it to be spicy and it wasn't spicy at all."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place - after much buzz - I thought it was all right.  They know how to make a killer pad thai, but was it worth the trek to the sketchy neighbourhood?  For mains, had the BEEF BASIL and the PAD THAI, the beef basil could use a bit more flavour, the beef was a bit weird.  The Pad Thai was amazing and delicious.    Overall, I liked it, but didn't love it.  I prefer Khao San Road, for sure.  They should also get their liquor license!!"}
{"text":"This is really a five now in my books considering that I'm here at least once a week- and I gotta say run, don't walk here before the press gets bigger! Sukho Thai delivers on tasty, authentic thai food in Toronto.  Their chilies and fresh ingredients will leave your mouth happy and buzzing on each and every visit. My favourites still include the pad thai, the fried fish plate (a crispy chunk of fish fried to perfection) and the tom yum kung-their hot and sour shrimp soup-a dish that is so bright and lively. One in awhile they offer specials showcasing less obvious dishes. I sampled a non coconut milk based curry here once and it was savoury, intense and comforting. Really the perfect cure to a harsh winter night. Another time I sampled a wonderful purple rice pudding laced with rambutan, a soothing tropical endnote to a wonderful meal.  Only drawbacks is that this place is tiny and there are often lineups due to the scores of  customers looking for their spicy thai fix. But call ahead or come on a weekday. With the gracious and warm service at your call and the outstanding food, you are in for a treat."}
{"text":"Food is nicely presented and tasty but portion sizes are way to small for the price.  The veggie stirfry came with a cup worth of veggies the majority being red and green peppers this was disappointing given the $14.00 price.  If a more robust mix of veggies were used such as eggplant, courgettes etc..I would not complain but the overuse of red and green peppers is in my opinion cheap.  My Tom Yum soup came with a side of rice. The soup was a nice balance of hot and sour.  I counted 4 medium size shrimps in the soup. Spring rolls were very mediocre the wrapper was hard and chewy and the straight from a bottle dipping sauce that came with it was a let down--they should make their own.  Every table was occupied during the lunch hour we visited so service was sporadic.  I would probably seek to satisfy my Thai craving somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty.  The service was fast and great. A must try. Having halal food is a big plus."}
{"text":"Sadly, this restaurant is NOT what it used to be. The location on Parliament st is still ok, but this location has always been terrible. The food is still damn good, but the service is horrendous. I just called at 4:45 pm to place an order for pickup, and a snooty girl tells me 'you need to call back at 5 pm, we don't take orders now' I said that is in 15 min, why can't you just take my order now. She replies 'if we take your order now, when we open at 5 pm, we will have so many orders that there is going to be too long of a wait' ..huh?! So if I call at 5 pm, and you take my order, HOW is that going to make it better for you? You still have to prepare my food. Not sure what she is thinking. I told her I don't need my food ready right away, in fact I was hoping to pick it up much later, so can't I just place my order now? Their takeout service is terrible. Often you wait for food much longer then you are told, orders are mixed up, and they treat their customers very poorly. I'm not ordering here ever again."}
{"text":"Great Location and interior space. Atmosphere is laid back, friendly and so welcoming. Food is simply Fantastic, esp the Khao Soi!  Best bang for your buck in the area. Summertime drink specials are a definite must try*"}
{"text":"I've been going here for many years.  5- 6 years ago I discovered this hidden gem in Regent Park. I had the sukhothai padthai and yellow curry. Holy cow it was delicious. I would order from this restaurant for take out literally 1-2 times every week. I tried every dish on the menu and loved it.  I didn't write a review at the time because the service back then was friggin horrible. Rude waitresses that didn't know how to give adequate customer service. I always said to myself that I would not go back because of the service..but the taste and flavour of the padthai was so distinct and good that I kept coming back like a drug addict looking to get her next fix.  I give this restaurant a 5 stars because after they renovate it, opened a 2 and then 3 location...the food was still amazing but the customer service got immensely better! The waitresses/waiters would actually smile! Love khao san road too and I always got superb service there, but sukhothai is closer to my neighbourhood so Im glad I stuck around to see the great service changes there. Good job to the management!  Must tries are to get the garlic chicken deep fries bites as an appetizer, and my favourite mains are the shrimp padthai, pad kee mao, khao soi, and even their version of \"pho\" is freaking delicious. Honestly...theres not one single item on their menu that I dislike..and I tried it all..many times. LOL."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE LOVE sukho thai. So much that I used to go atleast once a week for couple of months but lately..their food in both locations have been just meh. Somehow the food is just not the same. I noticed this change couple of months back and honestly I am not sure why the change.  Still..I wouldn't say the food is bad but not as good as it was. Considering that the food used to be way cheaper and the price still increasing (twice since this location closed for reno), I won't be eating here for a long time."}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful evening out here. The food is truly authentic Thai and absolutely incredible.   The spring rolls were crispy and not very greasy. The crispy garlic chicken was served with sweet and tangy garlic sauce. The khao soi was the hit of the night. It consisted of delicious noodles drenched in curry with green onions and garnished with crispy noodles. The flavour is just out of this world! You also can't go wrong with the Sukhothai pad Thai. You can order it very spicy with red chilies and it also is cooked with a flavourful peanut sauce.  Although service is friendly, it is also incredibly slow. However, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"****1/2 stars Ever since Laura C. and Tony F. have been questioning the validity of my Elite status due to the fact that there are so many Yelp namesakes that I haven't visited - I've been trying to knock names off my \"how-dare-you-trudge-around-as-an-elite-if-you-haven't-eaten-here\" list like an overly eager Speed Dater!  The icky weather made me want to eat something that would stoke my internal oven.  Sukho Thai was just a hop, skip and jump away from where I was - and why not kill two birds with one stone? Warm up AND get bragging rights so the next time I encounter my 2 disciplinarian teachers (ahem Laura, Tony) that I could score at least an A on my report card.  I arrived a little earlier than their 5PM dinner service time.  I was about to seek shelter elsewhere from the rain while waiting when one of the staff nicely gestured for me to enter and came to open the door for me.  Thank you for having pity on me!    They ARE closed between 2:30-5PM.    The decor of the restaurant is pretty bare bones - more functional than decorative but who cares?  You aren't coming here for their decor - you're coming here for the Khao Soi and the Tom Kha Gai!  As a child growing up I used to LOVE noshing on shrimp chips... From the store-bought bags, to the ones that accompanied the Fried Chicken dishes at Chinese restaurants - I just adored them!  So for the sake of taking a trip down memory lane I just had to order these.  They were served with a side of Tamarind Sauce.  I have to warn you that these are quite filling and although its hard, just try to put them aside and save some room in your tummy.  They were not as \"styrofoam\"-y nor oily - I would say a little more dehydrated than most shrimp chips I've encountered - but I'm definitely not saying that like its a bad thing! The Tamarind Sauce was more like a thick paste, which meant a little more effort required to get it onto your chip.    I also ordered the Tom Kha Gai (appetizer size).  This was a silky smooth broth-like soup served with chicken and mushrooms.  The mushrooms were served slightly raw, which I am not a fan of - but that was easily ignored when I consumed my first spoonful of soup.  It was citrus-y, creamy and spicy all at the same time.  I definitely recommend it!  The chicken was also very tender.  It seemed I was following the \"Silk Road\" today with my menu selections as the Khao Soi was also velvety smooth.   I have a proclamation to make... are you ready for it?  Sukho Thai makes the best curry I have tasted in Toronto!  I was a little adventurous and ordered this dish spicy.  Being spicy-sensitive my initial spoonfuls had me grabbing for water - but it was a pleasant kind of spicy that left me wanting more.  Being unfamiliar with Thai cuisine, I thought that there was no starch to soak up all the wonderful sauce and proceeded to order a bowl of rice - alas, I would later learn that underneath the crispy fried noodles would rest a bed of noodles.  The rice was not a waste for there was lots of sauce left-over and made for great leftovers the day after.  You do not want to waste this flavourful curry - you won't even need the \"there are famine problems in other parts of the world\" adage to convince you to doggy-bag it!  This is a more broth-y curry, and not thick and dense which is great as it won't leave you feeling 10 lbs. heavier.  I believe Sukho Thai is a family-run business, and mom came over to briefly chat with us - asked us what we ordered, chatted a bit about their dishes.    It did take a little bit of perseverance to get our water glasses refilled and one of the staff kept coming out with squared-foam trays that would ensure that I would have only a few drops of Khao Soi sauce left from spillage to finally get a round plastic container... so that's why I deducted a half star.  This is a place that serves high quality food.  My bill was around $21 before tax and tip.  If you haven't been to Sukho Thai - you better bookmark it!"}
{"text":"This is one my favourite places to go for Thai food. I'm never disappointed with their quality of food. Usually order the Thai fried rice and green curry. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Good thai food downtown, nice and spicy, service was good and turn around was quick, portion was a decent size. nice flavours!"}
{"text":"Been here on multiple occasions and I've always left fully satisfied! Hard to get a table sometimes because the restaurant is always packed but eating at the bar isn't bad either. My go-to orders are the Calamari and Beef Khao Soi. The calamari is delicious, crispy and comes with 2 equally good sauces. The beef khao soi is to die for! I believe it's made with a coconut curry base (don't quote me on this), super creamy, rich, full of flavor. The beef is always tender and soft. Comes with noodles in the soup and crispy noodles floating on the broth, you can order rice on the side as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was super anxious to try this Thai resto because I heard many great things from a few friends. But, I guess this location in particular (since many favoured the Parliament location) did not meet my expectations in comparison to the great experience I had at Khao San Road.   SERVICE: mediocore, it took about 15-20 minutes for the waiter to come over to take our order  AMBIENCE: nice and relaxing with many tables but no air conditioning so the windows had to be opened which didnt help because it was already 40 degrees outside  FOOD: overly disappointed with the SukhoTHAI Pad Thai dish i ordered; overall lacked flavour, was really oily, beef was cut improperly (either chunky or thin) and was dry  After this experience, I highly doubt I will come back to this location, I MIGHT try the other one."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with a friend. I got the khao soi with chicken and the garlic chicken nuggets. Garlic chicken nuggets hit the spot - not too spicy, not too garlicky and just the right amount of crispiness to tenderness ratio. The presentation of the khao soi was impressive; however, the garnish biscuit like noodles on the top actually hindered the process of eating it. You have to wait until they get soaked enough so they become soft to chew it, but even then they have a weird texture in your mouth. Better to just take it off right away. Also had the Thai iced tea which just tasted like concentrated sugar with milk. My friend's pad Thai looked and probably tasted average, most of it became leftovers for the nex"}
{"text":"Average food with non-existing service. There were incidences where servers gave us looks for ordering food. There are better places to be for this price."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great meal and excellent service! I had the curry and my wife had the stir fried vegetables. Both were excellent and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've been to Sukho Thai twice in the last two weeks and I find the food and service very average. I've tried the Pad Thai and a tamarind sauce curry with tofu, and friend spring rolls. The dishes are OK, none of them was outstanding. The service was OK, nothing memorable. The price was OK, not too expensive not too cheap. An average experience overall."}
{"text":"The food is great here! I got the pad thai and a thai iced tea, and also got the khao soi and garlic chicken to share. Definitely recommend any (or all) of these dishes. You can choose your level of spicyness, and trust me when I say that their spicy is hotttttt. Someone at my table ordered spicy and their lips were swollen and sweating the entire time.   The only downfall is the service. They're pretty slow and not very attentive, but that's okay because the food definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"I've been to Sukho Thai many, many times. The green curry with fish (again, because I don't like bamboo shoots, I've asked them to remove it.) This dish never disappoints me. It is always very consistent. I would have given this restaurant a solid 4 stars for the fish and past experience. Today, when I ordered the shrimp roll, I decided to share this appetizer with my co-workers, and after one bite, my friend asked me if the shrimp was uncooked. I said yes as it was still clear! So, just to be certain, I took one off the plate and took a bite to double check if other shrimp rolls were like that, again it's the same uncooked shrimp inside. It was a very disappointing experience. They took it back and cooked a new dish for me. While other restaurants would have taken this dish off the bill, the $9 shrimp roll was still on it. Anyways.. After today, I've changed my perspective on this restaurant-a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg. I had Khai soi here and I'm in love. Very tasty and generous portion. Went Sunday night at off busy time. Service was ok but food was amazing. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"If you're Vegan this is the place to try. As a vegan family it's hard to find good vegan food that would satisfy the entire family. Especially having a 9 yr and 12 yr old. Their eyes almost fell out of their socket when they tasted the food. In unison and excitement they said, 'oh my God this is sooooo good' I should have taken pictures of the food but it tastes phenomenal that I devoured it before the food can say, 'vegan cheese.' The wait staff was very attentive to our needs. As for some people complaining that the food takes too long is because high quality restaurant have real chefs that cooks from scratch. Most ordinary restaurants have pre-packaged food that takes seconds to microwave. All those big chains like Applebee's, Olive garden, Casey's all have pre-package food and not vegan friendly. If those chains have real chefs then they should be able to veganize the food but because it's pre-packaged they can't. The food at Sukho Thai is worth the wait. To top off out wonderful evening we found out that the chef was vegan as well. Would definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"Good soup. Try the Tom yum soup. It can be made very spicy. I can eat spicy Sri Lankan and Indian food and this was very hot.  They use red chillies. Lots of flavour. Also recommend the massaman price point is very good and the ambience is cool. Great if u like Thai food at a good price point."}
{"text":"That's the power of Yelp. 52 reviews, and it brings in more customers than ever, including me, who would have never heard about this amazing little place if it wasn't for Yelp  And I'm sure glad I did.  It's small. But you can make reservations. For Wednesday night at 6pm we didn't need it. By the time we left at 7pm, it was packed up stairs.  The downstairs room seems to fit a few more tables.   The food was delicious. The Khao Soi , yellow curry with noodles was heaven. We got it in medium spicy, which for a sensitive to spice person, was at my threshold. It was good, but would have liked it another notch down.  It was like Dan Dan Noodles but exponentially better. We got it with beef, it was so tender.   Mix the sauce with rice! Or take it home, don't waste it!  The Coconut soup was very flavourful without being pungent. I really liked it surprisingly.   We also got a phad thai, very tasty, but doesn't compare to the Yellow Curry.   They deliver and they offer takeout. I'm definitely back again!  For 4 people, spring rolls, dinner portion of soup+rice, Khao Soi, Pad Thai = $42.00 about, NOT BAD!!! I love restaurants with a good value for the quality and quantity.  There is free parking after 6pm on the west side of Parliament! Perfect!"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night at around 7 pm with one other person. Walked about 5 minutes from King station to where the restaurant was. Had no problem getting a seat without waiting. Their menu was simple and short.  Food *** We ordered the shrimp chips, chicken pad thai (spicy), and the yellow chicken curry. The shrimp chips' portion was decently big and came with a delicious sauce. The pad thai and the yellow curry also came with generous portions, enough for leftovers the next day. However, I thought the taste was just ok. Nothing special, especially for the high price that it was attached to.  Service **** Waiters were nice and were quick to take an order, refill water, etc.   Ambiance **** Really digged the decorations for the place although not sure if their air con was broken or it didn't exist.   Tips/Closing comments - Sukho Thai is a decently good Thai place to try with big portions albeit a bit pricey and just tasting A-OK."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend. Modern decor with a comfy feeling and not too far from the heart of downtown. I ordered the green curry and my friend got a noodle dish (pad sew?).  Food was good and came quickly. There was a deal on $5 summersby so we got that too. Good green curry, presented nicely. Not the best I've ever had but decent. The waitress came back like 3 times having forgot our orders which was a little weird but we all have off days... later as we were going to pay the waitress heavily played her \"single mother/poor me card\" which was kind of annoying. We both rolled our eyes and gave her an adequate tip. Frankly I don't want to hear about your c-section..."}
{"text":"I will never understand the hype this place has.  The long wait times, unwarrented snooty and inattentive attitude from workers, and average thai food.  A very \"meh\" experience indeed."}
{"text":"Review on takeout:  ***check your food before you leave the restaurant.   Ordered about $50 worth of food on a Fri night. When we got home, we realized that noodle was missing from beef khao soi (!) and they also forgot to put rice in the bag for the green curry.  Mind you, it was way past dinner time and the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  I was asked to come back to pick up the missing food item when I called. After persuasion, they sent a delivery guy with the missing food and some spring rolls as an apology (took 45 minutes).   Food was good but we weren't blown away. Small portions for the price."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, and service was great here. We were able to find a table for 2 on a Friday night after work without making a reservation which was nice. Usually at Thai restaurants I'll go for a meat dish, but this time decided to try a vegetarian option - I tried the tofu green curry and it was great! The curry itself was rich and flavorful, and the tofu was cooked perfectly. The portion sizes here are pretty big, which kind of justifies their slightly higher prices than some of the other Thai restaurants around. I was stuffed by the end of the meal and didn't think I had room for anything else, but was told by my friend that I couldn't leave without trying the Thai iced tea. I'm glad I listened because was amazing! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Their reservation policy is insane. Every single person has to be there at the exact same time or they will give your reservation away. And they act like they're doing you a favour by reserving a table for you more than 24 hours in advance. I wouldn't go here with a big group unless you want to feel like you're a burden to the restaurant.  *Edit: I seem to have had the exact same experience as Lea G. below. It's really off putting to have the manager discourage you from making a reservation for your group.*"}
{"text":"Having returned from a visit to Asia, I had to get my Thai fix. Sukho Thai sure did just that!  We ordered the shrimp spring rolls, Khao soi soup , and the Panang curry. Each dish was excellently prepared, the heat levels bang on , and portions just right. I did have to order an extra steamed rice as the one with the curry was a little small for sharing.  Prices are comparable and the variety of dishes enough to give you that Thai fix you are looking for."}
{"text":"Yum! One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in the city!   I absolutely loved the set-up. The service was ok - could be friendlier but they were fast and attentive. I had the chicken pad thai which was so yummy that my mouth is salivating right now! My partner had the fried fish with rice which was also very delicious! It was battered to perfection and had such a rich, authentic taste. We also shared a mango salad - very classic, and a side of calamaris which were so good! I've never been served calamaris that seasoned! They were spicy little poppers, battered and crispy, served with a plum sauce.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others and will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious Thai food. The green curry, masaman curry, khao soi and padthai are my favourites.   I usually order from here once a week."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today. The food was delicious. I got the shrimp chips and a spiced out gaeng massaman curry with chicken. Tonnes of savoury flavour and the spice levels were just right. Portions are more than the pictures indicate. All in all a good dining experience with friendly service and I'm happy to add a Thai restaurant to the weekly work lunch rotation. :)"}
{"text":"Not sure why so many people think this place is so great.  I went from a review in the Now Magazine. Difficult to get in because of construction.  Definitely a hole in the wall.  Ordered the shrimp chips while waiting... had to ask for them 3 times.  Tasted nothing like shrimp chips and came with a tamarind sauce that just didn't work.  Ordered a big thai soup.  What came was a Vietnamese soup.  Big chunks of overcooked beef instead of thinly shaved beef.  No fresh mint  or been sprouts on the side.  Sadly the worst Vietnamese soup I have had and certainly not Thai at all.  Won't be going back.  Hopefully I just totally missed the boat.  Go around the corner onto Gerrard st to Thai To Go.  They have great Thai and especially hummy Pad Thai"}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to try the food. The management here made it incredibly difficult to accommodate a group of people. I've planned a fair amount of parties the past, so I'm aware that there are time limits to using a table and the importance of showing up in time for your reservation etc. On the day of my reservation I got a call from the manager where he proceeded to frantically try and stress the point that if the majority of my party was not there 10 minutes after my reservation, I would lose my spot... he went on and on about this fact ... like dude, I know...relax...   It was to the point that I cancelled my plan there for my party because he seems so insecure about the restaurants ability to accommodate a group that didn't arrive all together.   Super bad first impression! Stop panicking about my reservations!  I won't try them out; ridiculous."}
{"text":"Ordered Tom Yum Kung and gaeng kiaw wan (green curry chicken) for dinner. They tasted okay but have been westernized, I e adding sugar. Not really authentic enough. Perhaps I should have asked for extra spicy if I don't have other options."}
{"text":"Tsk, tsk, tsk. My favourite restaurant in Toronto (Wellington location) clearly has an issue with the chef at this location. Ordered garlic beef and red curry fish. The beef was cut thicker than primary location without any wok hay.... not good. Any the curry fish was so watery it could have been a soup. Get your shit together."}
{"text":"Still the one.... I really don't get why KSR gets hyped so much.. sukho is way better and less pretentious... I could swim in the Khao Soi and enjoy myself.."}
{"text":"Not much can be said that hasn't already been said. The food is always great. The only downside is you can wait a long time trying to get through on the phone calling in for  pickup. Their Sukothai Pad Thai and spring rolls are a must."}
{"text":"I ordered take out food all the time here. Food tastes great. They are always busy at night and i don't have to time wait. Someday i might able to try to get in. Price are quite expensive for small portion. One thing i notice is the food doesnt taste as fresh as i make them at home. Staff are not too friendly."}
{"text":"I love the food here. If you're a fan of the food at Kao San Road you will enjoy the food here as well. The seating is much better; however, the service can be terrible at times. They get packed quickly but because there is so much more seating than other hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurants in downtown, you're more likely to get a seat.   The Thai Iced Tea is phenomenal and their food dishes are great! I've had several of their dishes: spring rolls, garlic chicken, kao soi, pad thai, and Thai friend rice. All of these dishes were amazing.   Would recommend going earlier or booking a reservation."}
{"text":"We had a great time there. The place is open, modern, and they display art on the walls. The waiter was awesome; polite, attentive, and friendly. Although, there was a big group in our area, he never missed a drink, and our dishes arrived at the same time. The quality of the food was excellent, so as the presentation. They give you big portions too. My cousin ordered the Guaytian soup. Simple and delicious. My sister asked for the Sukhothai Pad Thai. We all tried it and loved it. It has lots of shrimps, flavor and wonderful consistency. My husby ordered the Gaeng Garee curry. Which he loved. My dish was the only one that kind of disappointed me at the beginning. I ordered the Pla Taud. It looked like a little kids fish meal, not Thai at all. However, it tasted fresh and the sauce was spicy."}
{"text":"Spoiled from having super delicious and cheap Thai food in Thailand... this place is good!  This is another one of Nuit's restaurants. Same family as Khao san road, Sabai sabai, Pai, Nana.   Usually go for their pad thai or khao soi. Portions are decent but obviously it'll cost you a lot more than in Thailand.  The lights are a bit too dim.  They get a lot of office workers for both their lunch hour and after work so you may want to get there early (not sure if they take reservations)."}
{"text":"I've had a good experience here before but this time wasn't great at all!   The food was alright, we ordered a few appetizers, the beef pad Thai and the red curry. The curry was extremely bland this time, but it's been great the last time we came, so it was a disappointment on the consistency side.   The service was terrible. The waitress was very nice but she kept avoiding our table when we needed something. Took us about 25 minutes for water and for her to take our order. After we ate our main courses, we ordered a dessert. The waitress did not clear our table of the main course dishes and we were left with the corners of the table for our desserts. The table was stacked with dishes and looked so dirty. The appetizers, main courses and dessert dishes were all piled onto our table.   I also believe that the dessert that was brought to us was microwaved. It was a tapioca dessert. The bowl was extremely hot, but the dessert itself was cold under the first layer.   Not a great experience and not sure if I'll be back to this location!"}
{"text":"I started frequenting this place when it just opened almost 3 years ago under the ownership of Jeff and Nuit who now run Khao San Road. They took a lot of pride in the food that they put out, they wanted Toronto to experience what real Thai food was all about. Jeff is filipino and Nuit is Thai and from what I remember, Jeff said he met Nuit in Thailand.  I think about 1 year ago they sold the place to Jeff's father, who now runs the place and employs ppl he knows.  The food is more or less the same because Nuit passed on all the recipes to the cooks that are currently at Sukothai but the reason why I only gave it a 3 star rating is because even though the food is fantastic they consistently have service issues whether it's take out or dining in. People cannot say the service issue is a Thai thing because the employees are not Thai.  The way I see it is because it's super busy because of the cheap prices and fantastic food particularly the Khao Soi, the current owner is not overly concerned with providing good service because people will still frequent this establishment even if their service isn't good, just as long as it's not downright atrocious and I'm sure he knows this. If Jeff and Nuit still ran Sukothai you wouldn't have as many service issues because for them it wasn't only a business but something they created with their own hands. Hence the difference in service you receive at Khao San Road and Sukothai"}
{"text":"I LOVE Khao San Road so I was excited to try this place when I heard it was affiliated.  The atmosphere was really nice, the food was great as expected as well as the prices but the service was definitely lacking.   I went with a group of 9- we even made reservations. Once we ordered the waitress brought out one appetizer first before the others. We were done our shrimp chips before anyone else even had their appetizers. Then for the main course all of the meals were mixed up- she gave the wrong dish to the wrong people and one person had to wait even longer for theirs to come.   I really like the food, and maybe it was a fluke but I think I might just stick with Khao San Road.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"When someone said this was their favorite Thai restaurant in the city of Toronto, I HAD to try it.  When I read that they are related to Sabai Sabai (my favorite Thai place in Toronto), I was here for my next meal.  I even dragged my team members with me.  In case you were wondering about the name, Sukhothai was the capital of the first Kingdom of Siam in the 13th and 14th centuries.  It also means \"the dawn of happiness\".   The restaurant was nicely decorated and was inviting.  We were seated in a comfortable half booth table.  As I looked over the menu, I could see the similarities between here and Sabai (e.g. shrimp chips and tamarind dip and the khao soi).  Their most popular dishes are the Pad Thai and the Khao Soi.  In addition to their regular menu, they offer a lunch menu including everyday specials and daily curry specials.  The price range on the lunch menu is $9-$14.  Sukho Chicken Pad Thai - $13 - I asked the waiter what the differences were between this and the regular pad Thai.  He said the Sukho one comes with peanuts, herbs and lemon.  I guess it's like paying an extra $1 for condiments.  The portion was quite large, but that was the only thing I was impressed with.  It had good flavoring and I like the bits of tofu in it.  What ruined it for me were the soggy noodles that were sticking together.  Could it have been the lemon that did that?  Thai Iced Tea - $4 - This is the bright orange kind.  Pretty good, large sized glass, but pricey.  Although my first experience here didn't win me over, I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Love sukho thai for my thai fix!! I think its the best thai food in Toronto, from what I've experienced.  Can't wait to compare their food to real thai food in Thailand this summer! :D  Gets really busy and its a small place. During peak hours they dont take reservations either!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai food in town. Even though I'm not from Thailand, I can definitely taste and appreciate the extra layer of flavour in the dishes that puts Sukho Thai a level above the competition. Loved the Sukhothai Pad Thai, Gaeng Panang, and Gaeng Masaman. Bit pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! I have enjoyed them for many many months since they opened. I think that they're doing a wonderful job and making sure that customers are treated well and that they go above and beyond to provide good service. I will say however though that at times I think they miss the idea of how important is to have good customer relations. I paid a bill today for $35.03. I did not have a nickel but wanted to pay in cash. A good establishment knows to take the money over a credit card. I was really unhappy when the cashier insisted on the $0.05.  Note to management learn to recognize your good clients."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai place in the city. Wife loves the Chicken Pad Thai and o love the Beef Khao Soi.   Ginger Beer (Non-alcoholic) is my drink of choice here."}
{"text":"I used to live near the Church location, and I love that place, so while visiting some friends, we swung by the Wellington location for a quick lunch.   We ordered a few appetisers, the Fried Shrimps and the fried Tofu. While really good, they were dipped in the same batter, which was good, but made everything taste the same.  I ordered a pad thai spicy, could have been spicier, but it was decent. Next time I'll order it Thai spicy. It could have been a tad dryer too.   Might return for nostalgia sake next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great food! Tastes great and great portions.  The first time I ordered take out and the delivery guy had no change and forgot one of our dishes. The manager apologized on behalf of the delivery guy and offered me a discount for my next delivery. He personally came to deliver my second order and brought a big bag of chips too!   I've been in the restaurant as well and also had a great experience there too. Friendly waitresses and cute decor for a narrow space.   I always order their Pad Thai. Their spring rolls and shrimp rolls are big in size and so tasty. Amazing management, amazing food. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"The food is so good. I could care less if they are indeed understaff. Yes, it does get annoying when you try to seek for attention and no ones there. But, once you get your food. You'll feel as if it doesn't even matter. That fish filler I ordered was one of the best fish fillets I've ever had in my life. It was soooo crispy on the outside. So soft that it melts in your mouth on the inside. And to top that off with a thai iced milk tea. You'll realize that the reason why you work so hard is to eat. Agreed?!"}
{"text":"While chowing down at Khao San Road, I was referred to Sukho Thai, Khao San's sister restaurant. During this recommendation, I was lead to believe Sukho Thai was a dingy, hole-in-the-wall takeout joint with amazing food. Not true. Sukho Thai is a perfectly lovely little restaurant with great presentation and absolutely DELICIOUS food. I ordered a veggie pad thai, and was presented with a mound of noodles and sauce that could have easily fed two people (and it did). We were there quite late at night, and had the chance to chat with the owners and some of the kitchen crew, heightening the experience because they are all SO NICE. They're planning another location somewhere on Wellington, so downtown core, GET READY FOR FLAVOUR."}
{"text":"My friend was catching up with his friend and I came along for the ride.  We were craving Thai and his friend lived a 12 minute walk from here.  Sukho Thai it is!  We probably should have checked the hours before walking here, but we got here at 4:30pm and they didn't re-open until 5:00pm.  Dammit.  So make note people.  We walked around the area until 5.  We were the first ones there, but by the time we left an hour later, the place was packed.  I ordered a chicken pad thai, and both my friend and his friend ordered the cashew chicken.  Food came out at a reasonable time.  My pad thai was piping hot.  I had ordered it without the oyster sauce, just to make sure, as I am allergic to shellfish.  So it did taste a bit different, like something was missing.  But I think it was still good and they are very generous with the chicken.  I even had my left overs the next day, and it was still pretty tasty  My friend also agreed, that the lack of oyster sauce made the dish taste a bit off.  All three of us enjoyed the cashew chicken.  Really well done and VERY generous portions.  I feel like the dish can easily feed two people, but my friend and his friend easily ate it to themselves lol.  Sooo, it depends on which two people you're trying to feed.  Service was great.  While we were sitting waiting for the food, my friend's friend dropped his spoon and before we could even ask for another one, they already had a clean one at our table.  Dayum.  That's service lol.  Our server was super friendly and sweet but all the servers that night we encountered were very nice.  Anytime we had asked for anything, it was done quickly.  I've had Sukho Thai bookmarked for awhile, so I'm glad I finally got to come here.  I will definitely try the yellow curry or khao soi next time."}
{"text":"It can sometimes get packed, but this place never disappoints! My go-to's are the signature Pad Thai and the green curry. I've tried about everything on the menu and they're all tasty! I've taken a star off for long wait times, but this doesn't keep me from coming back!"}
{"text":"Is it worth walking from Yonge to Parliament? Through the scrappy loud angry Ladies J-walking?  Through the Hobos sleeping at the Church doorways?  Through the Cop cars zooming by?  YES!  Opened the door to see a table of LADY customers hiding behind the wall at 4 pm, otherwise it was simply ME and other walk-in pick-ups from time to time.  As the lady patrons went on their way, I was left with 6 other ladies.  The 6 ladies in the kitchen laughing it up enjoying themselves in their workplace and singing to Avril Lavigne on the radio.  Tom Kha Gai(Starter Size $5.00) came first and was absolutely INCREDIBLE with Coconut Milk, Lemon Grass, Button Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, Cilantro, Kaffir Lime Leave and pieces of succulent White Meat Chicken.  At this time I saw the other table got a refill of Water while I was without any, so I asked for it.  Khao Soi ($10.25) as the MAIN, yellow Noodles in Curry Gravy with Beef.  The Noodles were plenty and had just the right bite which is nice with the Curry which was a whole boat full.  The Beef was probably the Shank parts and was cooked as needed.  The crispy Egg Noodles on top gave texture contrast.  Comes with a Lime wedge, although this item is not my favourite it still was A-OK as I was probably just taken back by the price for an individual Noodle item.    At this time I still don't have my Water and it's a good thing I didn't listen to \"SOMEBODY'S\" advice to get everything spicy as I only had mild because even the mild gave me a bead of sweat.  It was a good thing that the whole place has 3 fans going that targeted the middle of the dining area which is where I sat.    Got my water once asked again, however I was the only customer so missing this service was not really an excuse.  The staff did apologize but it was too late as my 1 bead of SWEAT could not be recovered.  Tapioca w/Coconut Milk ($3.00) was typical of what I've had as a Chinese DESSERT with Coconut Strips.  It was kind of room temperature, while I was thinking it might be better as a cold item.  Overall I was HAPPY to get this chance to try something this good.  Sukho Thai was actually the reason I found and started using Yelp, so in a way I gave them 0.5 *Stars* while taking 0.5 *Stars* away for the lack of Water service."}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand for most of my grade school and all of my high school years so I can confidently say that Sukho Thai makes awesome food. My boyfriend and I often order delivery, but have never eaten in.   Our usual order consists of the following: Shrimp Chips with Tamarind Sauce, Sukhothai Pad Thai, and Khao Soi with Beef. The Tamarind sauce that comes with the Shrimp Chips is so good. The Sukhothai Pad Thai is different from the typical authentic Pad Thai, but it is good and not ketchup-y in the slightest (a huge blunder when it comes to some restaurants' Pad Thai.) The one dish that truly stands out is the Khao Soi... it is addictive! We always order extra noodles so that there is enough for all the delicious sauce. Everything is always delivered well packaged and the Shrimp Chips are always nice and crispy upon arrival.   Delivery usually takes longer than your average delivery time - usually around 1 1/2 hours, I think, but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Not an expert in Thai Cuisine, but I have eaten Thai from over 20 places in Toronto and hands down these guys are my favorite. I have only tried the Pad Thai, but it's the best I have tasted in the city. It is the first and only choice when I need a Thai fix... if you like spicy try the Thai Spicy and enjoy..."}
{"text":"This, I believe, is review 101.  That's a fair number for such a little shop.  Now, I cannot attest to decor, or service, as my experience is only with delivery.  Maybe I'n not \"street\" enough to be hanging out in that 'hood, or, maybe I'm just lazy.  Or, simply, I enjoy having the food come to me, as I have better things to do in the meantime.     As for the food, it's pretty fantastic.  Arguably, the best pad Thai I've had to date, and quite a large portion of it.  The medium has just enough spice to enjoy without feeling overwhelmed, however, next time I'm ordering the hot for good measure.  If it is so hot, it induces chest hair, I'll go back to ordering the medium.  Aside from this, I had the pleasure to enjoy the Panang curry, and it was so good, I become convinced, even more so, of a higher power.  This, because said higher power is apparently working in the kitchen at Suko Thai.  Yes, that good.  I almost went to church the next day, and that never happens.  So, yeah, believe the hype."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to my Asian cuisine, so my friends had to convince me to even dine at Sukho Thai in the first place. Fortunately, I don't regret coming here at all. The food is the main attraction here - and it looked great, smelled great, and tasted great. They serve generous portions at this restaurant (and we may have ordered too much), so we weren't able to finish all of the food. Nonetheless, I left with my belly full and a willingness to return here in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Sukhothai the other day and  what a complete turnaround my experience was from my previous review. The music was lowered to a reasonable level, the service was fast, and the food was incredibly delicious! Our waiter (his name was Brandon) was great. Very friendly and efficient.   For starters we had the crispy spring rolls. They came out almost immediately and they did not taste old or reheated. Very crispy in the outside. The spring rolls are filled with seasoned veggies and are served with a spicy plum sauce to give it a bit of heat. Very yummy and something I would recommend to others seeking a decent spring roll appetizer.  For the main, I ordered the same thing as last time (Sukhothai pad Thai with tofu) and it tasted just as good. I inhaled the entire thing.  My husband had the Khao Soi and he said this item is also featured in the KSR menu... It tasted similar - very delicious, very spicy, and it continues to be his favorite dish.  In summary, it was a satisfactory dinner. I definitely noticed some changes to their service as it was remarkably faster than before and our waiter was very attentive. Their food has never been an issue for me as it has been consistently delicious! 4 stars! Huzzah!"}
{"text":"food is super mediocre, just nothing special. There's definitely better Thai food DT Toronto.  service is also not good. Seem to have a very inefficient way of serving customers. Sat down for 15 min and didn't even have a waitress, then proceeded to wait 30min + for our order to arrive. The place wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"Stop frequenting Spring Rolls and get your bum to Sukhothai now! Wholesome food, appropriately-sized portions, delicious prices. The following is a review of menu items I've tried at Sukhothai thus far, with the recommendations of a friend named Marianne :)  GARLIC TOFU easy on the batter, garlic flavour is evident but not overpowering, light and crisp in texture, soft-medium tofu texture is pleasant, house-made sweet & sour garlic sauce is drinkable! just joking. you know what I mean.  SUKHOTHAI PAD THAI (w/ shrimp) tender yet aldente rice noodles http://bit.ly/bBFeZ2, plump and juicy shrimp, crunchy beansprouts and even crunchier chunks of finely-chopped peanuts http://bit.ly/bBFeZ2, requested level of spiciness mellowed out with the squirt of 2 lime wedges!  PAD THAI (w/ tofu) didn't find a huge difference in flavour between this dish and the \"Sukh'ed up\" version above, but was told the Sukhothai Pad Thai has more herbs and has peanuts mixed into the stir-fry. hmph.  GREEN CURRY (w/ chicken) bamboo shoots had just the right amount of bite (for me to reminisce upon filipino dishes from childhood), fragrant coconut milk broth is drinkable (not joking this time), thin chunks of chicken were extremely tender (perhaps pounded to tenderize?), would have prefered this dish with brown rice instead of white... and wish the restaurant would start offering brown rice as a side dish alternative!  TAPIOCA w/ COCONUT MILK coconut milk liquid seems somewhat thinned out; the dish tastes less rich but still satisfying, on a scale of 1-10 the sweetness of this dish is at a 6.5 or a 7, small tapioca pearls are less daunting than the humungous tapioca pearls most bubble-tea enthusiasts are used to, yet this dessert remains mediocre to me; I wouldn't order it again.  More Sukhothai menu item reviews to come... Holla!"}
{"text":"I am new to Thai Cuisine and Sukhothai has delivered in every way: taste, experience, ambiance, and presentation. Everything was great from the Pad Thai to the Tofu Nuggets and the Beef. Great place to get some real authentic Thai food in Downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Managed to get in just before 10pm which is when the kitchen closes.  Friendly staff.  Massaman curry with chicken is not the typical mild golden curry.  This one had lots of tamarind ànd peanuts.  Peanuts were nice.  Sour flavour was good but not really what I was looking for.  Lots of crispy fried onions on top which was nice.  Also got a Tom something soup which was really good.  Sweet and sour and tomatoey. The mild is spicy but I got medium which was very spicy but manageable."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and don't be afraid to try the 'Thai spice' level. The service isn't great. Would recommend reservations as this place gets packed. The menu is pretty standard for a Thai place and taste is good. Would recommend"}
{"text":"The red curry with tofu here is amazing! Along with the Khao Soi. The best Thai food I have had in Toronto. Have eaten at the restaurant and the service was excellent! Ordered delivery through ubereats and the food was still warm when I got it and a very generous serving size. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here for team lunch on a Wednesday. We ordered Khao Soi, green curry, pad Thai, and Calamari.   The Khao Soi was definitely the winner. The curry soup was so creamy, rich, and flavourful and the bits of beef was very tender. I also enjoy the mix of the wet noodles in the soup and the crispy dry noodles on top. Green curry with chicken was quite mediocre. Wouldn't order this again.   We ordered all of our dishes with medium spice, and we can definitely feel the kick from the dishes. Pad Thai was the most spicy out of the dishes, but delicious.   Service was slightly below average. We had to wait a long time for a cup of water and the waiter did not allow us to split the bill.   Overall verdict: Go to Pai instead, same great food with better service and ambiance"}
{"text":"It pains me to say this but... Meh,  I don't see what the big deal is about this place.  And I really really did want to love it!! I live in the area so like to support local businesses and what's not to love about the story here? That being said, the food was just ok and the service sub-par.   The first time I had veggie curry and rice. It was good but forgettable. It tasted pretty much like the many other versions of this I've had elsewhere. Except that it was very heavy tasting. Not  a good thing.   Next time I had a veggie guaytiaw noodle soup. I asked if they had a completely vegetarian version (i.e. no meat or chicken stock in the soup). The waiter kindly went to check and yay, they did!  While I appreciate the attempt, the uninspired broth tasted pretty much just like water, salt and lime juice. Way overpriced at $10. Actually I find all of their menu items are  much higher than other thai restaurants.   My husband had the beef guaytiaw soup. While it looked amazingly delicious, he said the big chunks of beef tasted like they had been cooking all day.   The spring rolls ordered with our meal never arrived. Fine, I get it, mistakes happen. What shocked me is that there was not even the slightest attempt at an apology. When we went to pay, the spring rolls that never arrived were on the bill and we politely said that we never received them. The staff person then took our bill, blankly punched in things on the computer and then wordlessly handed us a new bill minus the spring rolls. No apology. Not a word. NOTHING!!! I was stunned. It was obvious that she just didn't care. Such an obvious lack of concern for your customers is unacceptable. It's as if they know that people are going to keep coming because of all the hype and they really don't care if a few people walk away unsatisfied. What a shame."}
{"text":"I've eaten at all Sukho Thai locations going back when they only had the Parliament location.  I was always a big fan of the original location it was some of the best Thai I've had in this city.  This review is based on my recent takeout order.  Ordered: -Pad kee mao 1/5 Reason: Bland, lacked flavour and ingredients were not the freshest.  Ordered this at Spicy spice level.  I've ordered from this location before and found the standards to be lower than the other locations. -Spring Rolls 4/5 These were fine tasted on par. -Casva Cake 4.5/5 Very good dessert and would happily order again.  Overall I'm would give this location another try in the future and hope the kitchen staff has improved."}
{"text":"Picked up take out and everyone in the group was happy.  All the dishes were as good as expected, but maybe a little less spicy than anticipated.    Its a close second to kho san road."}
{"text":"Solid Thai spot in the core. Started out with the crispy spring rolls which are unbelievable.  Their mango shake is also very tasty. Although the Sukho Pad Thai is a signature dish there,the Khao Soi was even better. I don't think I've ever had a better thai curry than the one here.     I've waited 20 mins once, 40 mins the other time, and did take out within 15 mins of calling.  The place is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was lucky to have stumbled upon a review for Sukho Thai once I had returned from my travels (including thailand). This is the most authentic Kho Soi dish I've had since being in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand.  The chef, Nuit, and her husband are great people and a pleasure to deal with.  I'll continue to recommend this place and I wish them all the success they deserve."}
{"text":"Would give 0 star if I would but the one star would be for the food, which was delicious but the service was just so horrible that not matter how good the food was I would never return again.   I have never experienced service as bad as this. First of all, we made a reservation ahead of time, got there on time but was made wait more than 30 minutes. Asked host how long it would take multiple times, never provided an answer. I understand that you are a busy restaurant and not all reservations can be met on time, I'm fine with that but the attitude was just horrible. Finally sat down after waiting for almost 40mins, food took another 30 mins to come after ordering. Food was very yummy so we brushed it off.   Finally at the end of the meal I asked to speak to someone in charge to provide some feedback. Person I spoke to said he was in charge and I explained the situation and told him our experience. He was very pushy and cut me off several times before I could finish my sentence. After being so fed up I said that I didn't think you deserve the 17% tip that you automatically added to our bill, to which he responded \"you guys should be more careful when you are tipping next time.\" Excuse me??!   Horrible experience... would not return."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 4-5x in the past 18 months (3x for lunch and 1-2x for dinner) and it has become worse and worse. Food is good but service is not.  Service: I feel like they are perpetually understaffed. I understand the restaurant gets really busy, but management should know that and staff accordingly. Whenever I'm here I feel like I am often looking for our server (or any server) but they are all rushing around and seemingly avoiding eye contact. I mean, they aren't rude, but they are adequate at best. Water didn't come until our appetizer arrived and I had to remind our server about our other drinks when our mains came but our drinks hadn't. Wouldn't be a big deal if it happens once, but I feel like service is always lacking here.  Tonight's dinner consisted of:  Crispy spring rolls: 3/5. They were fine, nothing special. We wanted the fresh shrimp rolls but they had run out of fresh mango for the night so they couldn't make it. On the same strain, I would assume they also couldn't make their mango salad. Mango seems like an important ingredient to be stocked up on at a Thai restaurant, no? It was about 7:30 on a Thurs night so it wasn't that late either.  Nua gra teaum (stir fried garlic beef with egg and rice): 4/5. I liked my dish. It was tasty although maybe a bit plain.  Gaeng phed (red curry with chicken): 4/5. BF had this dish and he liked it.   But really, I'm pretty disappointed with the service and this is probably my last time at this location. There are many other Thai places in the city that I would rather spend my money at."}
{"text":"I've eaten almost everything on their menu. My favourites are: shrimp chips, pad thai, pad kee mao and khao soi. Bonus is that it's also halal which is so inclusive in a multicultural city.   Place gets very busy in the evenings so make a reservation. Chill ambience, great for dates or just catching up with friends. The wine list is also pretty decent. I enjoy the malbec with their meals.   Every meal is delicious and service phenomenal."}
{"text":"Went to Sukho Thai with a girlfriend after the gym yesterday. We arrived around 7:30/7:45pm and were seated quickly.   What we ordered:  Fresh Vegetable Rolls - nothing to write home about. The rice paper and noodles were nice and soft, but there wasn't any seasoning in them. The peanut sauce on the side had good flavour, but could have used more heat. There was mango, red pepper, Thai basil, iceberg lettuce and rice noodles in the rolls.   Pad Thai with Tofu - $13 - my friend ordered this with medium spice and she liked. The noodles were nice and chewy, but she found that it was a bit sweet.   Sukho Pad Thai with Shrimp - $14 plus $1 extra for shrimp - I really enjoyed this dish. The server said that it wasn't as sweet as a traditional pad thai and had more cilantro in it. I love cilantro and didn't find there was a lot of it in the dish. Noodles were also nice and chewy, there were six shrimp in the dish. It was more savoury than the regular pad thai.   Thai Iced Tea - $4 - It was really, really sweet. I have a major sweet tooth and even found it was too sweet. I left it until the end to let the ice melt and dilute it.  Service: The hostess was very friendly and we chatted a little as she was seating us. She wiped down the table, but there was a bit of food left on the table. Our server noticed when he came to greet us and said he would come wipe it off again, but never did.   It wasn't overly busy so not sure why service was a bit slow. We were greeted in a normal amount of time, but it took a while for him to come back to take our order. The food did come pretty quickly after we ordered. We didn't see our server again until about 3/4 through our meal. The other two tables next too us were pretty much done their meal so maybe he just spaced out a bit.   We were done food for probably 15+ minutes before he showed up again to clear them. After we paid and were putting our coats on, he cleared our glasses before we stepped away from the table. Not a bit deal, but it seemed a bit odd for him to be MIA for so long and then to pounce on clearing our table before we had left.   Decor/Atmosphere: The space has been nicely renovated from when it was Hernando's Hideaway. Exposed brick wall, mix of banquette/regular table/high top seating, two raised seating areas in the front by the window. There was interested art work on the walls, the music was at a good volume and the lighting was good.   Overall: I will be back because the food was really good. Our server seemed pretty \"green\", I would have rated this place a 4 star if the service had been more attentive."}
{"text":"I had always been impressed when going to the original Sukho Thai on Parliament Street, but admittedly since moving back to the west side I've been sticking to home delivery from another thai restaurant. But sometimes having food delivered to the house isn't going to cut it and you've got to take someone out to a restaurant to impress them, right?  Well this place did the trick. For one the location is much nicer than the Parliament location. There is more dim lighting, less people crammed together at tables, and a generally more intimate vibe.   And yes, the food is good! I can vouch for the pad thai and the green curry as both being consistently delicious. Also, on this visit we started with the Garlic Chicken Nuggets which are more like chicken cylinders with a surprisingly tangy dipping sauce. Really good! Definitely a good sharing dish too (whereas the spring rolls are a bit awkward being served in orders of 3). On the drinks front, between the more-so impressive crafted cocktails and the not great but adequate beer options (Beaus is the only craft option, but they have Sapporo and a couple of their subsidiary brands like Okanagan Springs as well), it was a pretty satisfying meal all in all.  While I'll stick to my other place for delivery, Sukho Thai is probably my favourite thai restaurant to sit down in the west end."}
{"text":"Ever have a review sitting as a draft for 4 months because you expected to go back and be able to review more? Unfortunately, I've since moved away from the east end  and will simply submit what I experienced last fall.   It's a small menu, but this place seems like the kind of place that would rather do a few things really well than trying to be a jack of all trades with a sprawling menu that probably would dilute the authenticity of those items on the menu. After reading reviews online, I decided to avoid ordering delivery and called in an order for pick up. 15-20 minutes later I arrived and everything was ready to go, and upon returning to the house, I was quite happy with the experience. It was a simple order of spring rolls and pad thai. Essentially what my entry level experience is at most thai places. Spring rolls were okay, but the pad thai was really unique in being of the authentic tamarind, and non-ketchupy kind.   I'm going to give this place 4 stars even though it didn't convert me into a regular customer, as it was money well spent and a satisfying meal (based on memory and a half written review on the pad thai and spring rolls)."}
{"text":"As everybody else has confirmed with many words, Sukho Thai is absolutely fantastic and is easily the best Thai in the city for the money. Tips: 1) If you're trying to get take-out and no one picks up the phone, no fear they're there, just busy. Still go, don't worry they cook it quickly! 2) Try out the basics, the Pad Thai is fantastic. 3) The mango salad is good, if you eat in, get the combo!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing non-stop about this place, and KSR. Obviously, I came here because its cheaper (duh).   Anyways, we arrived here at like 7.30 on a Tuesday...I had called earlier, and they said they were full up on reservations...it was empty. Lol.   We ordered the shrimp chips to start, while we waited for our other dinner guests.  The chips were good, though I wasn't a fan of the dipping sauce. I just didn't like the texture.  Also had the lemongrass iced tea, which I found to be a bit..underwhelming. I feel like they downplayed the lemongrass. Maybe that's just because my brother overloads on lemongrass when he cooks...but thats another story (lol)  Anyways, once my friend came, we ordered:  1. Khao Soi with Beef - I had this. It was good at first, but I grew bored of the flavours. It was a bit too rich, and had no vegetables. I wish there was. The beef was tender and juicy and delicious. It wasn't too spicy for my taste (I had it thai spicy) but my dinner compadre's were freaking out. Cute.  2. Sara KP had the Khao Soi with Chicken (read her review)  3.My other friends had the chicken stir fry, super mild. It was really flavourful.  4. The Tom Yum ...so GOOD. OMG. WOW. PERFECT SHRIMP AND PERFECT BROTH. I was surprised that it was a bit more tomato-ey than I expected, but in a good way.  5. For desert, we had the casava cake and the tapioca pearls. LOVE THE TAPIOCA. The cassava cake was really good too, had a really cool texture..kinda like this dish called mwitumbwa from east africa...I'm pretty sure its the same thing now that I come to think about it...   Notes:  1. The server we had (bald guy + labret piercing) was SUPER DUPER NICE and awesome  2. On the other hand, we all got our mains...and my soup (a starter) showed up towards the end of the meal...  3. The portion didn't look huge to me at first, but boy, there was still a lot left over! (Obviously I ate up all the beef first, before leaving anything else. I mean, how can you leave meat on your plate. That's like a crime against humanity or something)  4. The food here's Halal, so I can bring a few friends here who won't eat otherwise!   5. Total bill, with above + some wine, was like 95 dollars? Not bad @ all.   6. I want to go back, and try some other things next time. Otherwise, kinda underwhelming."}
{"text":"Ok, THIS is a place you have to try! it's between a 4-5 star for me!  Khao soi spicy with either beef or chicken - AWESOME spring rolls - awesome GAENG KIAW WAN - awesome tom yum kung spicy - okay too spicy but very good sukho thai pad thai - okay, had better pad thai  Still more things on the menu to try but so far most things I like! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Giving this place a second chance tonight after last time's cockroach incident... Even worse. Waited 50 min for my food tonight. Sweet and sour pad Thai was also terrible on my taste buds - tamarind paste overkill.   Never. again."}
{"text":"Yes I went back to this place because my friend who works around the area couldn't stop bragging about how good the food is after it's been bought and turned back into thai food instead of Chinese like it used to be. Once again love their decor and I think they added fish tank. The fish tank is a real beauty. So me and hubby ordered two drinks. I had their Sukho thai mango drink in coconut cup. Deliciously awesome, flavor and presentation, his tom yum martini disgustingly undrinkable. So we ended with another glass of wine. I had spicy tomyum soup that was Luke warm and salty but still pretty good. His coconut milk soup was also Luke warm but flavor was very good. Again like an idiot, I tried Amok steamed in banana leaf (it's my favorite Thai or Cambodian dish) hoping to find a different version from my favorite at la petite Mangue. My man ordered duck in five spices sauce. The duck came out really tough and seemed like it was frozen before. The sauce was really sweet like hoisin. The vegetable was whatever. It was just not good for a $33 entree. He was so excited about duck. My amok smelled way too fishy before the waitress even put it down on the table. I had four pieces of fish in there and the rest was just slimy onion and basil leaves. I think I'm giving up trying this this at any other Asian restaurant. The waiters were nice and friendly and the soups were good but I give up on Sukho thai. It's definitely not worth $100 something for two"}
{"text":"Come on Sukho Thai, get it together!  We waited almost an HOUR for our meal, and the people next to us said theirs took almost the same time. Since we're regulars at Sukho Thai on Dundas, since it opened we were extremely put off by the loooooong wait. Uber Eat orders get priority as does take out, so forget it if you don't want to wait forever for your food. Once you get it, it's fine. After three complaints including one young server who said \"Five minutes\" after a half hour, meaning they hadn't started making our dinner, and then another complaint, they finally gave us some cold fresh rolls straight from the fridge, with a lot of stodgy peanut sauce, far too thick. If there was an owner on the premises I would have comped the meal and written it off to bad timing but the service needs ramping up, and the kitchen cannot cope with both streams of revenue."}
{"text":"Came here as a party of 4 for 8pm dinner without a reservation and was seated immediately. We had some very special guests tonight with us, and they loved the ambiance - called it hip and loved the exposed brick wall and string lights. Also commented on how the volume of the background music was just right, soft enough for conversation.   Ok, the food. Amazing Thai curries can be found here, but not as stellar as curries at Bangkok Garden on Elm Street IMO.   Garlic tofu nuggets (appetizer) - Nothing too spectacular, basically just crusted tofu deep fried. Quite addicting though to mindlessly munch on while waiting for our mains!  Gaeng phed (red curry w/ squash) - $15. This was my order. I loved the squash, the firmness and buttery flavor. The curry base itself was very (coconut) milky, but not as dense or creamy as the base I had at Bangkok Garden, which I loved. The curry base here is too oily. The spice level here is definitely tourist friendly. I asked for a medium spice level and found it very tolerable, i.e. no pain tomorrow morning.  Gaeng panang - My partner ordered this one. Don't order this - he was disappointed by how small the portion was and how nondescript the food turned out.   Gaeng masaman - Swap in basa filet (fish) for an extra $1.50, do it! The fish was sooo tender and boneless of course. This curry is thicker and heavier than the others as it features potatoes, which thickens the base into almost a gravy-like quality.  Tom Yum Kung - $12 for the large... Which was still quite small. TBH I've had the small size tom yum kung here before and was never super impressed because of how tiny the portion was. The soup itself I also find too acidic. Though compared to fast food Thai tom yum soups, this one is not as laden with cheap cooking oil or MSG."}
{"text":"Lacked flavour - spring rolls were the only good thing.   The worst part about all of this, I have been sick for going on 3 days from this food. Proceed with caution....."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. We went recently for my husband's birthday and the food was delicious and came quickly even though it was busy. We really appreciate that they can make the pad thai vegan. Our server was very friendly and he didn't rush us even after we had finished our meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"PROS: - this location serves halal - their peanut pad Thai is to die for - the venue is really nice   CONS: - no parking - every time I order the garlic chicken nuggets it's undercooked - they open super late, last time I got there at 5:30ish and they were still closed  - staff isn't the nicest.   Over all I'd probably still go there for the pad thai"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's usually quite a busy Thai restaurant. If you are looking for good Thai food, this is your place. For starters, we ordered the Crispy Shrimp Rolls and Veggie rolls. They are served nice and hot and tasted very good. They definitely make their Shrimp rolls well. As a staple of any Thai restaurant, I always order the Thai Ice Tea and it tastes quite good. Definitely worth ordering for any Thai dining experience!! For my entrée, I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. It was good and cooked well with the right seasoning. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are looking for a good Thai restaurant, give it Sukothai a try."}
{"text":"Delicious! For those days you want good thai food that is also not fast-food. I ordered their Gaeng Masaman (came with rice) and Sukothai Pad Thai (tofu for both) over the phone, and picked it up within 30 minutes to enjoy at home. Highly recommend those two dishes, whether or not you get it with tofu. Reasonably priced, and great portions."}
{"text":"If you want good thai food without the lineup of Pai, then Sukho Thai is your best bet!    I came here with my girlfriend on a Friday evening and we barely had to wait at peak dinner time. I was told that their food is comparable to Pai but if you're incredibly hungry and craving good thai food, waiting is the last thing you'd want to do. There comes a point where a minimal upgrade in quality of food doesn't necessitate the wait.   We ordered the pad kee mao and the khao soi which are the classics here and they did not disappoint. The khao soi was flavorful, rich, and very creamy. The beef here is meaty with a nice chew, they are the chunky kind but not too tough. The pad kee mao was tasty although I'm not sure if it was peppery and herby (basil) enough as the flavor profile indicates - there was a lack of bell peppers. We also had the fried shrimp appetizer which was nice a crispy straight out from the fryer but I'm not sure if I'd order it again. I'd really recommend the thai iced tea which is a straightup flavor punch, you can taste the intenseness of the tea and creaminess from the condensed milk. Portion sizes were sizable and we were stuffed by the end of the meal.   The restaurant is very simple with a bar area yet also a bit rustic with an entire brick wall on one side. Service was acceptable and was fairly quick and efficient."}
{"text":"After coming here a few times, I have decided that Sukho Thai is officially one of my favourite restaurants in the city.   Their food is so good that I am willing to forgive them on their lack of attentiveness (during lunch) and the long wait to get seated. Overall, in terms of service, staff were friendly and seem to cope well under the pressure of serving so many people. Our server for dinner tonight was lovely and very accommodating.   ST's take on the classic pad thai was really good - it was just more flavourful and tasted fresher than any pad thai that I've ever had. My absolute favourite dish so far (even though I've only had a few dishes) would have to be the chicken khao soi. One of the best dishes that I've had in a very long time period. The curry had the perfect consistently and had just the right amount of richness without being overwhelming. The chicken was very tender. The noodles at the bottom of the dish tasted so bomb because they soaked up all the flavours of the curry and the crunchy noodles on top made the entire dish look so elegant. For $15, I would say that getting the khao soi is a really good deal! I couldn't finish it all so I ended up taking the rest home. Forreal though - if you ever do come to Sukho Thai, order the khao soi!  ST exemplifies quality - they make up for their small menu by making the quality of their food so good that people coming here regularly are willing to get the same things over and over again. I look very forward to returning and trying out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"THE BEST Authentic Thai in the city. Do take-out, don't dine in at this location - If you're looking to dine in go to the wellington location. A must try!"}
{"text":"I am a Thai lover and place was a big disappointment and if you consider the price it is even a bigger disappointment. The ambience is like a fine dining & so are the prices but the food isn't even worth 2 stars. The veggie Pad Thai was watered and tasteless. Any of the dishes except 3 curries do not come with rice. The price range from 12-17$ each.  My veggie red curry was thin like water and all I could taste was sugar. The quantity of food was good but the food was not something I would visit them again ever."}
{"text":"So much hype around this place, and I get it, its a great Thai treat for Thai fans. I thought I liked Thai food cuz I love Chinese food and well, all Asian food is alike right?! I dont want any flack about that remark cuz all y'all asian restaurants serve spring/egg rolls! I've eaten Thai rice at Peking Express (a block away from Sukho) and that rice was easily a 453 times better than this authentic Thai rice!  I just don't get it ppl, I eat and I eat and still, I just can't find a locale that gives a damn about MY taste buds... The rice was just OK (hence the 3 stars) and I sampled the Pad Thai and I can't tell you how big the sigh of relief was that I didn't order THAT. I know that everyone loves the Pad Thai, but I wouldn't care if the Dalai lama hyped this place up; I wouldnt go back. I could tell that all of their food has a similar flavour..    I did like the atmosphere, the whole family vibe was nice but I could not care for that rice if I tried.  The rice tasted like they boiled it with Mr Goudas soup base.  I'm conflicted cuz I don't wanna bash this place, but I don't wanna lie either...  It wasn't terrible, I personally just didn't like it so up it's! Oh!! AND the price did a number on my wallet!!  It was NOT cheap.."}
{"text":"Best Phad Thai in Ontario so far.  Limited menu selection means almost all of the food are great."}
{"text":"Went to Sukho Thai for a mid-week dinner with some friends.  The Parliament location of Sukho Thai restaurant is a small, hole in the wall kind of place with few seats and a small, one page menu.  There was only one server and the restaurant was packed when we arrived (we waited around 10-15 minutes before getting seated), so don't expect top notch service.  Our server was slightly impatient due to having to attend many customers, but our orders were taken correctly, our waters were filled up and generally all our needs were met.  After browsing the menu, my friends ordered a Pad Thai and some rice dishes and I ordered a Pad Sew (noodle with chicken, red and green peppers, and mushrooms).  There were several options for spicy-ness at the restaurant: not spicy, mild, medium, and hot.  I ordered the not spicy and got a little bit of hot sauce on the side.  The pad sew was large and very yummy.  Overall, Sukho Thai serves impressive, large portions of food and it tastes above average.  As long as you don't mind a tight, cramped restaurant with not much service, it is worth checking out.  3.2 / 5.0"}
{"text":"I never knew how good Thai food could be until my cousin took me to Sukho Thai. We had the Gaeng Kiaw Wan and it BLEW MY MIND. So flavorful, instantly warmed me up on a cold wintry day, and the spices...just wow. No words. After each bite I had to stop and revel in it."}
{"text":"Editing my review from below. They have picked up their game and this location is now back up to par with the other     Really must say that I love the original location. But this new location is just not as good. I ordered food from them last night and none of my favorites were up to snuff. My second try. I'm only writing this review in hopes that the owners read this and improve their expansion. The Parliament location is much better but even that one hasn't been as good as it used to be. I wonder what's happening. I usually love it. The parliament location was a 4 and now is about a 3 and this one just doesn't pass. Sorry Suhko Thai."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was packed. We managed to get a table after waiting for five minutes. My friend asked our server what the red curry was, as she genuinely didn't know the difference between that and the green curry, and the server said \"it is curry that's red.\" Wow, thank you, so helpful. Otherwise, she was prompt in refilling my water and the food was delicious, fresh, and came in large portions. I had the Veggie Pad Kee Mao, which I recommend but I will probably get medium instead of spicy next time as it was very spicy. The daily specials are $9 so those are a great value, and they have different curry on the specials list. I will definitely be trying one of those next time as my friend's was really good, and I'm usually not a curry person."}
{"text":"Please make a reservation for this place! It was jam packed on a Friday night. Arrived at 7PM and waited for a good 45m-1hr until getting seated for 3 people then another 40min for the food.. but they did not disappoint. It tasted GREAT. The pad thai wasn't the fake ketchup ones you get in most places and the green curry was simple with bountiful amounts of chicken and bamboo shoot. I got the tofu veggie stir fry and all the ingredients were super fresh and tasty. It was worth the wait + hype. The price point is also spot on, affordable high quality food for your buck! Would return here again but would definitely make a reso ahead of time."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in the city. Baly far bar non. I can't help but keep coming back. I get serious cravings."}
{"text":"I've only eaten in the restaurant on Wellington, which is clean and pleasant, but I order delivery from Sukho Thai at least once a week. It's hands down some of the best Thai food I've eaten in Toronto. My favourite dish is Gaeng Phed, a red curry with squash, kaffir lime leaves and red pepper. I get the fish as my protein option and order it spicy. It's to die for."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered takeout from here - but here's what my experience has been like:  - food is ready pretty quickly (20 mins or 30-40 in busy time - comparable to most places)  - Pad Thai is great! Ive had it a few times and it's good and you get a lot. Would totally recommend.  - Spring rolls and chicken nuggets are same as you'd get anywhere. Small, tiny. Nothing gourmet about them. I could get better from the freezer section in my grocery store sadly (this is where a star is lost)  - Price is somewhat expensive for what you get. For the pad Thai, worth it. For the other app-like items, not at all worth the price. So, I always end up feeling like I spent more than what it was worth altogether.  - Menu doesn't have a whole lot to choose from but the main items are good and again a good portion size.  - Parking is doable on the side streets right next to Dundas, for free. Dundas is also accessible to park as long as it's not during rush hour. All good!"}
{"text":"I order takeout from here all the time. It's great!   Very consistent.   Really though, I wanted to write a review so that I could reply to another review that I completely disagree with.    In reply to Lea G's 1 star review about booking a large party:  You can't give a restaurant a 1 star review because they asked you to be on time for your reservation.  Small restaurants require that the tables be sat more than once in an evening dinner service, so when you make a reservation at 6:00 and the entire party doesn't arrive until 6:30, you are affecting the flow of the entire night, not only for the restaurant staff but for all the other guests as well.    This behaviour puts undue stress on the staff to rush your order so that they may accommodate the other group that will be occupying your table later in the evening.  Even though you are given a time limit, the staff can't kick you out if you haven't finished your food (and you know this) so you act like you aren't aware of the time limit and the next Group that made a reservation has to wait on you.  How would you feel if you were that group?  You'd probably write a 1 star review because you were on time for your reservation but had to wait 30 minutes for your table to be ready.    You showing up late affects the staff of the restaurant, the other diners both around you and ones that will arrive after you, and lastly you and your guests.  If you don't have the experience you were hoping for and you are late for your reservation, you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Stop being so entitled and understand that even though restaurants are all about hospitality, it's not their job to accommodate you and your late friends while ignoring the rest of their patrons.  I'd also like to point out that after checking out Lea's other reviews, she clearly cannot be pleased."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place for dinner because we both were craving Thai.  It was an early dinner on a Wednesday night, the place wasn't too busy which I was happy about. I ordered the Tofu Pad Thai with a mild spice level, which wasn't spicy at all but the waitress offered chili oil on the side.  All in all my meal was mediocre to be quite honest, but I would go back and try some of their appetizers and curries.  The service however was excellent very attentive and quick, also I really liked the decor and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Best pad thai I've had outside of Thailand."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly service! Came here for dinner with a friend and we both loved it. The garlic tofu was crispy, delicious, and really satisfying for an appetizer. We split the masaman curry and the sukho pad thai, both of which were amazing. The curry was very flavourful and hearty, and the pad thai was spicy yet sweet. We got up feeling full but not heavy. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The food is great here, authentic Thai food. The service is fast and efficient. It's a busy place. I was there on a Friday night and the place is packed.on busy nights I would strongly suggest a reservation. In terms on entrees I suggest the Pad Thai and any of the curries.  Something's that the restaurant can improve on are:  The music was too loud, it's not a club, I would like to have a conversation without having to yell at my table mates. In addition the person who took my reservation was rude, he needs to work on his customer service skills.  However I can overlook these minor issues and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Overrated.  We went to the newer location and my friends ate 1/4 of their food.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Was at the Parliament venue first and decided to take family to the Wellington restaurant for better ambience. Food was a bit disappointing. Ordered Khao Soi and Lap Salad and they were too salty. Nothing compares to quality of Parliament store. Lemongrass tea, both iced and hot, had no taste. Was quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Edit, since their food is soo good, i am giving them an average of 3 stars. -------------------------- EXTREMELY DISORGANIZED during rush hours!  I am very disappointed in you Sukho Thai, you have lost me as a customer.  We were a group of 8 people, came as walk-in during rush hours and were told to wait for an hour. Before we started waiting, i made it clear to the staff that we can definitely split into two groups and sit separately, we don't need to sit in one place.  My family was waiting on the other side of the street 2 minutes walk away and i was in the restaurant.  So some time passes, every other customer who walked in with me has been seated and now new people are coming in, i see two tables free beside each other, both have spaces for 4 people, the person managing the table comes to me and says \"Call your family and we will get you guys seated\", my family came, and she is like wait we are waiting for people to leave.  I said what table, why are we not sitting at these 2 tables which are empty, she is like i can't sit you guys there coz of some \"service area\", and i will get you seated as a group, I said i told you we don't have problem splitting the group just give us these tables, she said no sir i can't give you this table.  Listen Sukho Thai, why should a customer care how you handle your \"service area\", i said treat us as a two different groups, you got two different groups of 4 seated in those tables before us, why?  I complained to the manager about this, and he was apologetic, but he still didn't give us those tables, we had to wait another 15 minutes, he gave us free appetizer, but that's not even a band-aid.  I loved this place enough to bring my family here, and I was pretty disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Simply the best pad-thai in town.  Having tried almost all the top-rated Thai kitchen in the city from Mengrai, Bangkok Garden and the sister restaurant of Sukho Thai (Sabai Sabai, Khao San Road) - must say that Sukho Thai did not fail to impress.  Pad-thai was definitely the highlight of our dinner (we tried their Sukho-Thai Pad-Thai instead of the regular one). The noodle was cooked perfectly with all of the character of a great pad-thai present (sourness, spiciness, sweetness) and come in a great serving size as well. The flavor was really there and I can't recall the last time we had such a great pad thai in Toronto.   The service was great as well - our server was very attentive, very quick and food arrived promptly despite the restaurant being busy.  Overall - was really impressed with Sukho Thai and as of the writing of this review, the best Thai restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in the city. I have been to both locations (other one is on Parliament ). Service is great and food us consistently delicious.  I always order their Panang Curry. It is quite spicy but so flavourful."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Food is fantastic and the vibe is great. We always take out of town guests and they love it too. Only issue is the wait to get a table and if you are doing a takeout order on the weekend it takes a while to get through on the phone."}
{"text":"There are a few location in the city where Sukho Thai is available. When I think Thai, I will most definitely keep this place in mind. Though far from being fancy near Dundas and Parliment, Its the service and food that makes this place a hidden gem for Thai food. With plenty of seating, great service, reasonable prices, portion and great menu selection we were ready to roll!!!  Service was superb, fast, friendly and efficient.  By the clientele you can tell there are a lot of repeat customers with the reputation they've got. As for food we started off with their Crispy fried shrimp spring roll; fried to a lovely crisp on the outside and warm in the inside, great starter. For mains we tried their Khao soi with beef and Gaeng Masaman with tofu and chicken.  Both presentable, their portions were a lot, but the broth...ahhh was comfort.  Overall both entrees were a hit and filling!"}
{"text":"Great food, great location! I've tried almost everything on the menu, and it is all amazing."}
{"text":"When I'm in the area, this place is one of first places I think of to get food. The prices are reasonable and the food is great.  The Khao soi is a staple that I always have. A generous portion of the curry with noodles. But the flavour in this is complex, the picture on the website is a little bit misleading, lot more curry than goods. that or the bowl is bigger.  I really like the garlic chicken, but the sauce that comes with it has a bit too much kick. Unfortunately the garlic tofu is not as great, they use a firm tofu and the taste is not as profound.  Red and Green curry are both nice, I am partial to the green curry as the basil has great flavour.  Tapioca with coconut milk is as described, also does not look like the menu because of the way it's served (in a bowl), but a nice way to end the meal.  I like this place because it feels more mom/pop, not too hard to get seats (though sometimes you gotta sit downstairs which is a bit dingy), and the parking around here is much cheaper than many other places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai is as authentic as it gets. Run by a young thai couple, who had a restaurant in Thailand, they serve fresh delicious dishes. Everything is made to order with superb ingredients. The space is small and designed mostly for takeout. Order in advance. Swinging by is well worth the drive. A new favorite!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto. Everything you order here is pretty authentic so you can never go wrong. For dinner, we always try to come before 7 pm coz it gets busy after that."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants. But lately, the quality of food has deteriorated. Penang chicken too salty, while the Pad Thai too sweet. Their management barely acknowledged it when we told them about it. Sad but all true."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get Thai takeout.  If you can handle the spice, order \"Thai Spicy\" and they will deliver.  I like ordering the Khao Soi when I'm in the mood for something substantial (it's creamy and thus pretty heavy), but there's so much good stuff to select on the menu.  A friend of mine recommended the lemongrass drink with sugarcane - which was super sweet and refreshing.  I also like the mango salad.  If you're looking for fast and delicious Thai (esp. takeout), there is no place better than Sukho Thai."}
{"text":"My goodness! This food was absolutely incredible. Everything we are was amazing and you will not regret eating here."}
{"text":"The food is great so is the ambiance. Make a reservation if you're planning on going to this place on a Friday or Saturday. It gets packed and there's always a long wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Short Asian guy at the counter doesn't know how to talk to customers. He was impolite. When your mood is spoiled the food doesn't taste that good.  Please teach your staff how to do customer care or just don't put them on a customer-facing job."}
{"text":"Worth the walk from uptown.  The items on everyone's plates (politely scanning the restaurant), all looked good!  I had chicken khao; very tasty (could have been a 'bit' hotter).  Interested to try the cashew chicken (looks great), was rough on my stomach afterwards (spice). Other than the EXTREMELY annoying woman who made sure EVERYONE heard her awful, vapid, complainy conversation; it was a good visit.  Would return."}
{"text":"I was a fan of the original Sukho Thai and they recently moved to a new place in Wellington. Pud Thai was good though a bit sweet for my taste. The Shrimp Chips are good starters. Location itself was ok. You could tell that it was occupied by a former pub. A bit too dark especially for a family restaurant."}
{"text":"Not going to lie... i was excited. I love KSR and I have heard great things about Sukho Thai on Parliament so hearing that there was a sit down resto on Wellington was a big win.  When my friend suggested to eat here, I felt like she had read my mind because I was  thinking of their food. At 6pm, I walked in a lovely large open space that fit groups of all sizes.  We were greeted by the waitress and told her we weren't quite ready yet but that was when it started going sour.... she didn't come back for what seemed to be about 10 minutes.... I was starving so I wish there was someone I could make eye contact with, but there was really no one around our section or to place I order so I patiently waited.  Second sour note, There was only one dish I wanted to get but wanted to get more information first - the 1 NON Pad Thai dish... the waitress knew NOTHING about it and could not offer any input except that it was a popular item... well DUH aren't all their items popular?  I just trusted my instinct and went with it.  Third Sour note - this dinner was for two people. My dish comes out first... and my friend was told her dish would be right out... it was probably 2 - 3 minutes before it came out...WRONG... how hard is it to mess up an order for two?  Fourth Sour note - I had asked for my noodles to be medium spicy... which definitely met my expectations... but there was WAYYYY too much pepper to the point where I was coughing quite a bit because the pepper were really bothersome and took away from the overall taste of the dish.  All in all- the food was really OK... the service was really non existent and even when I asked for water, I felt I was inconveniencing the waitress just by the look of her face. We were also rushed out of the restaurant and even as we were walking out, the lady in the front pretty much walked into us to go clean up the table for the next group.  Good thing I had great conversation with my friend :).. i think i'll stick to take out at the other location."}
{"text":"I had to give sukho Thai a poor rating due to the cleanliness. My glass of water had a dark residue in it and I only realized after I started to drink. Not sure if I would come back after this experience .."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. We ordered green Curry and yellow Curry noodle soup. This place is usually packed and you might have to wait. And the food came out a little slow but just get some appetizers and you should be okay. It's worth the wait. I really likes the Curry noodle soup. It was the first time I had this and I have had many other thai dishes. This is definitely one of my favourites now."}
{"text":"We went around 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and the place quickly filled up. We ordered crunchy spring rolls, medium spice pad thai, and cashew chicken.  Spring rolls: they were crunchy indeed! They were mildly spicy, and the shiitake mushroom flavour was not too overwhelming and just right.  Pad thai: The noodles were chewy, and it wasn't one of those ketchup-tasting stuff at all. One of the best pad thais I've had. They're gentle with the spice levels. The medium spice that I got was really not that spicy.  Cashew chicken: also very good, and it comes with jasmine rice and some sweet and tangy mango salad. The flavours were strong, but well balanced with rice.  The portions were generous. Service was friendly. Parking was a challenge though - only street parking was available."}
{"text":"real thai food, so good, been coming here for few years now, never disappoint"}
{"text":"If you're into fancy looking restaurants, this is one fancy restaurant.   The prices are kinda a bit expensive... but the food is okay. I went with a friend and we wanted to go for Thai food and it was pretty darn fast on how the service was despite it being really busy during dinner time... and we got a table, which was nice.   I got the Pla Taud, and the fish was effing amazing, but the rice was kind of bland and dry and the mango salad was not something of my tastes. The sauce provided too was really spicy so I tended to avoid that lol... but other than that, it was alright."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai serves some of the best Thai I've ever had. Try the veggie cold rolls, suko thai pad thai and the green curry. The coconut tapioca dessert I my favourite dessert in the city. This place gets really busy, but go early and you shouldn't have a problem. This location is really nice too (compared to the one on Parliament St). Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Sukho Thai and am so glad I did. Great food and great ambiance! We ordered chicken pad thai and the cashew chicken dinner. Both dishes were delicious and unique tasting in a good way, though my cashew chicken could have used some heat (hey, just cuz I'm a white girl doesn't mean I don't like it hot!)   Service was confusing and disorganized at times, but I wouldn't say it was bad. We had no issues with our meal and found everyone to be nice and accommodating. For example, the Cashew Chicken comes breaded, but they had no problem making mine without the breading. Overall, we had a really nice time and will definitely be coming back. It's so nice to have great thai in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I had been to Sukho Thai before for dinner and I had ordered delivery from them before, but this was my first time going for lunch. This review will be based on my lunch experience.  I came with two other diners, one if whom was both vegan and following a gluten-free diet. Our server was very good about informing her which dishes she could have and she went back to the kitchen to ask if she was not sure.  The dishes we ordered included the Thai red curry with tofu (vegan and gluten-free), the curry lunch special of the day (comes with chicken), the Thai cold shrimp rolls and the mango salad.   Everyone really enjoyed their meals, and my two dining companions who had not been to Sukho Thai before both agreed to return; however, there were a few small glitches that prevented Sukho Thai from receiving the full five stars on this review.  1) The lunch curry special of the day cones with a considerably smaller portion of curry than you would receive with the full sized portion. Granted, it does cost less than the full sized dishes; however, when it is promoted as the special of the day, you think you are receiving a deal or good pricing. It would be nice if the lunch menu indicated that the servings were lunch sized portions.  2) One diner ordered the Thai cold shrimp rolls and the mango salad as their main course. This dishes arrived about five minutes before the other two dishes, which isn't a big deal because they are cold dishes so don't need to be eaten immediately, but it's still a bit awkward to have them sitting on the table while you wait for the other meals to arrive. These dishes could easily have been held back in the kitchen until the other diners' meals were ready, and then all of the meals could be brought out together.  3) While service was attentive during our meal, we had a hard time tracking down our waitress once she had cleared our plates and we wanted to pay our bills.  Overall it was a satisfying lunch and I will return. I would recommend making reservations before you arrive - you don't want to disappoint your Thai craving if you are faced with a wait!  One bonus of Sukho Thai is that it does take reservations and has incredibly similar (if not identical) dishes to Khao San Road (as they used to be owned by the same people) which does not take reservations and you may encounter a two hour wait for a table there!"}
{"text":"I must say that the Pad Thai at Suhko Thai is some of the best I've had in Toronto, but this place is not good just for its pad Thai. The service and decor is great. I really felt as though the servers cared, and our server was definitely very well informed about the menu. The only thing I can dock off points for is the noise level, it was very very loud! That's not enough to stop me from going again though, I highly recommend everyone try this place!"}
{"text":"I came here with a larger group who had been here before. Oh my delicious goodness. This place is GREAT! I ordered the cashew chicken and could not finish it! They serve a very generous portion for $15! I asked for spicy and they delivered!  I took a look at the other dishes and I know I would not be ordering the fried rice (generous portion though), Gaeng Masam dish, but I will be trying the pad thai next time."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here per verbal assurance from the staff. Perhaps we ordered food on an off night, since although the food tasted good, everyone in my party who had the yellow curry (with chicken) ended up with serious stomach issues that night.  Besides the yellow curry we ordered the Pad Thai (good), fried rice with beef (also good) and the Chicken Satay (tasted a little bit different from what I'm use to but still good).  The price was also a little on the high side (over $60 CDN) for our take out order.  May give this place another try when I'm back in the area, since it's gotten a lot of positive reviews and perhaps we all happened to get sick from something else?"}
{"text":"It's one of the places where you gotta eat when craving for Thai food. This place is worth 5 stars due to it's service and food quality. Our order came in less than 10 minutes within ordering. The restaurant itself is nice and cozy but a little small. It's a great place to take your friends to after work or just to chill. The atmosphere is amazing though it can be loud at times. I recommend this place to anyone who loves Thai food."}
{"text":"One of the better Thai places I have been to. You must try the khai soa. The noodles on curry. It was very good. They also had very good fried shrimp rolls. Normally shrimp rolls all taste the same or similar. This one was very flavourful and had a hint of spicy kick to it. As much as they had taste dishes they also had dishes that missed. Their Panag curry was way to sweet. So was there coconut soup. They also may have gotten a hire rating from me if there staff was a bit more attentive. Don't get me wrong they were very friendly and help full when they were there. It was hard to get their attention. Maybe they were short staffed."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, and it is AMAZING. The food here is very well made, the flavours are rich and spicy (to your taste) and authentic. It's one of those places you just don't tire of. Be sure to try the Khao Soi - my favourite so far. The Pad Kee Mao is also very good. Another favourite is the Garlic Shrimp - just the right amount of crisp and flavour. My friends and I always try different things off the menu, and haven't yet been disappointed. The best Thai in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The food is really good.  All the flavors are spot on.  We got here at 5:00 on Sunday night and the service was very good as well.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Like most Thai enthusiasts, I'll be comparing Sukho to Khao San Road (and the new Pai). The servings are a little larger, the pad thai has a tangier flavour, and the menu has a bit more selection/variety. Our waitress was slightly inattentive, but I noticed that the other waiter working that night was very friendly, so the service could be hit or miss. We didn't have a reservation, came right when it opened at 5:00 on Saturday for dinner and were seated immediately. Cassava cake for dessert was big enough to split between 2 or 3 people. Overall, a great alternative to KSR, without the 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"My colleague suggested we try this Thai restaurant for lunch today.  I am glad it is located just within walking distance from our office.  The restaurant is not big but very nicely decorated.  The space between tables is wide enough so I don't feel crowded at all.  The servers are very friendly.  I ordered the Wednesday $9 special...gaeng masaman (chicken curry w/peanuts, tamarind sauce, onions and deep fried shallots with rice).  My colleague ordered a pad Thai.  The portion of the curry special looked tiny but actually it was just enough for me. The pad Thai was not bad but my colleague said that the pad Thai in Canada is always a bit salty.  We got very delicious complimentary spring rolls as a compensation for a 30 mins wait for our lunch.  Well, this thing happens.  The kitchen possibly screwed up our orders.  The server came to apologize and handled the incident very friendly.  The food there definitely worth the wait but hopefully not 30    something minutes again as promised by the server lol.  I will go back for lunch or dinner when I am craving for Thai food again for sure:)"}
{"text":"The food is good, in fact great. But I'm not coming back because the cashier was trying to pass $977 bill for a $77 dinner without saying or even showing a sign of being sorry. It's really hard to believe it was a typo both from the distance of 7 and 9 on the machine and her annoying look that it was discovered. Without integrity no business lasts very long."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. They are too busy to care about customer service.   I have ordered takeout from here a dozen times since they opened as they are located down the street from me. And 80% of the time they make a mistake with our order. They never say sorry or try to correct their mistake. In fact they make you feel bad for asking that they correct the order.   Their food is average and the experience is poor. I will not be going there again and I anticipate that many people will stop going there for the same reasons. There are too many good thai places in the city to waste your time eating here!"}
{"text":"There are a few places that come to mind when someone asks me for recommendations on Thai food. However, I must say that despite the average rating of 3.5 stars for this place, this is the place that I recommend the most, when compared to the other places (I'm sure most people can think of at least two other Thai restaurants that I am talking about).  The main reason is consistency. Food here has always been delicious. I've tried at least one item per category (apps, soups, mains, curries, etc.). While I have my favourites, I can honestly say the flavours always come through.  My top recommendations: garlic tofu or chicken nuggets, khao soi, tom yum kung, and the Thai fried rice. I ALWAYS order the fried rice when I am here. I am a huge fried rice fan, and out of all the popular Thai restaurants, this is the place to go to have your fix.  Four stars, and not five, because of the service. I don't experience rudeness or anything, but they are slow. Perhaps I have a pretty long fuse, but I generally come here knowing that they will be a bit slow. Something to expect and keep in mind when you are out and have other plans. Recently, I've noticed an improvement in service (I was there last week during lunchtime on a Friday), and we didn't have to wait too long.  Bottom line: Food is consistently delicious and will not disappoint, but service could be a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Really good pad Thai!!! Best I've had in a long time. And the ambiance is beautiful... all good vibes!"}
{"text":"Sukho Thai has excellent food and I've already eaten there twice since I discovered it last week. It would have been thrice but they were closed on Sunday. Like almost everyone else here I got the Khao soi which was excellent. I remember Khao Soi being served in a slightly different way in India where they would give you the curry and little bowls with the 'toppings' on the side and you could add whatever you wanted to it. Nevertheless this version tasted great and I wouldn't really want to change anything about it. To be honest the location is a bit crap especially if you don't have a car and have to walk through the shady neighbourhood and the restaurant itself isn't too great either. However the food makes up for it and the service is great too. The staff tries its best to make sure you are well attended to and even though dishes can sometimes get delayed, the important thing is that the staff is trying really hard and not just standing around being lazy which is a lot more annoying. The restaurant is not the fanciest place but I guess its OK considering how good the food is."}
{"text":"Came here for a GNO dinner :)  THAI ICED TEA 3/5 It's yummy but be warned - it's very very sweet! My friend asked for less ice and thought that was a bad idea haha   KHAO SOI (with chicken) 3/5 Very rich in flavour. There are crispy noodles up top and regular soft noodles in the noodle bowl. The display is very cute ad colourful. It is also so filling! I couldn't finish the whole thing!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came at around 6:00PM in the evening. We were a group of six and it only took us about fifteen minutes for us to get a table. Mind you, every other group ahead of me were groups of twos and threes, so perhaps we were lucky to get this table. I suggest you call in and make a reservation if you don't want to be waiting around!! It gets crowded at the door very quickly.   My group ordered the khaki soi, massamun curry and each of the soups that was offered. The best dishes were probably the soups, particularly the guay thiaw! Other than that, I thought the food was great, but it wasn't out of this world either.   It took a while for us to get the bill, plus we found out that we could not split our bill when we got it. They also automatically add a 17% tip for parties more than six. If you're going on a big group, I suggest you be prepared to pay back someone who will cover the entire bill"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. On the one hand, the food is pretty good! On the other hand, service and atmosphere were not so good everytime I came by... The only time we enjoyed our sukho thai dinner night was one time when we ordered take out.   If you're looking for good thai food, give this place a try for sure. No doubt you'll be getting some really flavour packed foods and that Khao Soi is amazing!! Spicy broth, rich and creamy, full of noodles and meat. I would avoid beef. The last few times I had it, it was always dry and hard. :( I was hoping it was just one bad night but nope. Maybe try chicken? But definitely consider take out if you live nearby.  My sister ordered thai ice tea which tasted great! We also got some type of a fried rice and the mango salad and calamari apps. Everything tasted great and were presented beautifully at reasonable portions.   I think the price might be a bit higher than the average thai place and the service is always hit or miss. There's not much consistency in that aspect.  So one time we made a reservation because we had a table for 8 and we knew it would be a busy night. We get there and though many staff saw us, none greeted us... they just told everyone to wait.. But I saw an empty table to the back and figured it must be for our reservation because there's no other table of 8 standing around. We waited for a while and finally just walked up to a staff and said we had a reservation and no one was greeting us. She pointed to the table at the back and gestured to have a seat... It was also right next to a big birthday party. They then proceeded to tell us it would be a 30 minute wait at minimum for food tonight so we placed our orders quickly. The dessert in the end was forgotten and so we cancelled it before we would be told its another half an hour next to this extremely noisy party.   The dinner experience was not so great. Food is good, but everything else is avoidable."}
{"text":"By far my favourite thai food place.  Been there over 5 times, and ordered a few times as well.  My favourites are Tofu Suko Thai Pad Thai and the green and red curry dishes.  Also getting the garlic tofu (for vegetarians) is a must.  No complaints about this place, will always be one of my favourites.  Look forward to trying out Khao San Road"}
{"text":"Ten to the T, to the IME. If your group of ten is craving Thai food and don't want to wait for hours on end to be seated (in comparison to many other popping Thai places in Toronto), this place is your gig. For food to arrive may take a while longer, but what's the rush when you have a large group and can chit chat your way till your stomach grumbles in protest?   Pad Thai at Sukho Thai is what I buy, now will you try? Man, I missed my career calling as a rapper. Haha! I'm sure the music industry is thankful I missed that boat. At this restaurant, the curry isn't as thick and flavorful in comparison to other sites in town so I stick with pad Thai. Caution. Spicy is no joke. We aren't talking about Canadian Spicy. We're talking about Thai spicy that can keep you mouth hot bite after bite. Could add a dash of lime, but the noodles are very flavorful, well balanced with bean sprouts that add a slight crunch, topped with peanuts that add to the presentation and texture, mixed with well cooked chicken that is slightly on the dry side but I haven't had juicy chicken in pad Thai before, even in my days visiting Bangkok.   The shrimp is seasoned and crispy, a dash of spice that adds an authentic flavor to the magic dish. Cashew chicken is also very tasty. Chicken is well cooked but juicy within. Then again, did you really expect a bad review for deep fried dishes? Who are we kidding... deep fried dishes are usually a win for many of us.   Overall is a restaurant that I come back to here and there, but not a restaurant that I crave over. Mind you, took 1.5 hours before our food arrived. Would recommend if you're around the area, but not worth a special visit if you're looking for jewels in the city."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had anywhere, hands down. I have not had anything here that has not been amazingly delicious, but I keep going back to the pad thai as my mainstay.  The biggest downside to this place is the service. Nearly every time I've gone here at least one person at my table has had their order messed up. However, the staff is usually friendly and apologetic about it."}
{"text":"I like Sukho Thai. It's solid and dependable. I'd give it 4 stars for food even, because the food is good, above average Thai food - but the service here is universally terrible. If you go here with 4 people, for sure, without fail, they will forget someone's order or bring someone's entree 20 minutes after all the others. It's just how they do.  Even worse than that, they don't answer their phones, so you can't really order takeout. I live in the neighborhood, and I find it disgusting that I can't call for takeout. I've brought this up with the restaurant, and they said \"oh, you can just order on the Maegan app\". Which I would do, except that Maegan doesn't work on my phone - a Samsung Galaxy s5. What kind of app doesn't work on that? It also doesn't work on my laptop, or tablet. So the app is basically useless, just like a Thai restaurant that you can't phone for takeout."}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time with this restaurant. Does it matter how good the food is if the service is terrible and the whole experience is stressful? We have successfully ordered only once, and it was on Valentine's Day. For this reason, I thought the crazy delivery time of about three hours was understandable. I didn't realise this was business-as-usual. I get that they're very busy, but why offer the service if you really can't deliver (no pun intended)? On V-day I had set my heart all week on ordering in from Sukho Thai. Being pregnant, waiting for food is a challenge. Eating at 9:30 at night is painful. So that part of the experience was very disappointing. We ordered the signature pad thai, crispy spring rolls, and the khao soi with beef. The pad thai was ok, but not as good as Khao San Road (which is what I was expecting). The spring rolls were absolutely average. The khao soi was delicious, but there were literally five pieces of beef in a giant tub of curry sauce. Is that normal?? I don't know, but I thought it was a pretty poor performance. We tried ordering again this past week but declined to wait for almost three hours for our meal. I don't think I'll try it again. All said, I'm hugely disappointed in this place; I'll have to save my thai nights for trips down to Khao San Road."}
{"text":"The good: - The food was incredible. - The prices are very reasonable.  - You can order anything, and it will be amazing. There's a limited menu, which makes ordering a lot easier.   The bad:  - took 2 hours of standing, waiting for my pre-ordered take out! 2 HOURS! (i still can't believe it ..)  - the service. yeah, there is none of that here. Good luck getting a table if you're submissive or overly polite. It won't happen, as the staff doesn't know what's going on either. - prepare for a 'couples' fight', if you're unprepared for the uncomfortable 'don't know what's going on' factor. During my wait, I witnessed 3 couple-fights over, 'go ask what's taking so long!'. If you and your significant other end up arguing at IKEA, then stay far away from Sukho Thai. - Watched 4 tables get completely incorrect orders. Food was moved around for a good 15 minutes, up and down stairs, back up stairs again, that food had seen all corners of the very cramped restaurant.  - 2 tables left, after not receiving drinks after 35 minutes.  - When other reviewers stay this place is small, they're not kidding. My 6'5\" boyfriend had to wait outside, as he was (literally) hunched over in the main area of the restaurant. With that being said, the ceiling are low!  - I watched so many ethically questionable customer service actions during my 2 hour wait, I'm not sure I'd ever return.    But it was so tasty ...  But the service was sooo terrible ... Why must you tease me, Sukho Thai :("}
{"text":"This place was fabulous. Ever since returning to Toronto a couple of months ago, I've been looking for a good, reasonably priced Thai place in the east end of the city. This is the place. I can't give an overly comprehensive review since all I tried was the Pad Thai, but this one dish was fabulous. I'm not generally a Pad Thai fan (I usually opt for a curry), but upon the suggestion of my friend I order the Chicken Pad Thai. It is definitely the best Pad Thai I've had in recent memory.   Our server was amazing. He was personable, friendly, understanding, and quick. I made a special request to have no egg in my Pad Thai. My meal was a bit delayed compared to my dinning partner's meal and when the server noticed his promptly addressed the issue with the kitchen and I received my meal in no time at all. He was also great at suggesting other great dishes from the restaurant to try next time.   The food here was great, the service a pleasure, and all at a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"Literally the best Thai food in the GTA. This is associate with Pai (I had this and it's just as good!) and Kiin (I'm booked to try it next week!). The chef is a freaking god! Best food ever!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai place should have pad kee mao and also able to make really spicy dishes.   Disappointed that's not on the menu. This is during ritual eats week so I ordered a chicken pad Thai with Thai spicy on the app.   It's so plain and not spicy enough. Doesn't taste much better than food court quality Thai places.   Not enough protein and too much rice."}
{"text":"Last year I have been to Sukho Thai for a few times, it was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, the food taste and quality has decreased. I just wish they haven't changed. Their curry used to be creamy and full of flavours. I just had a beef massaman curry few weeks ago. It wasn't really good. The tamarind sauce overpowered other flavours and the curry sauce was water downed. The beef quality wasn't as good as before. I also tried their Sukho Thai Pad Thai. Again, before it tasted amazing and now... :(."}
{"text":"Great location, great ambiance, impeccable taste sensations and an all around enjoyable experience. Try the khao soi , it's unreal. Just bring an appetite."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai. Great for business lunch. Reasonable pricing. They can make it spicy!!!  5/5 *"}
{"text":"Walk--in for 3 people Friday night 8pm. The wait was only 20 minutes so that was a plus. We'd been here once 2 years ago and were unimpressed yet we decided to give it another try since the friend we were meeting lives around the corner.  We ordered two apps and the mains at the same time. The apps came within minutes of being ordered then the mains took almost half an hour. Our server was OK but somewhat spread thin and inattentive. Being a vegetarian I didn't want fish sauce in my dish yet I love pad kee mao so I asked if they could sub the oyster sauce for soy or something else. When the food came the server apparently took it upon himself to just order me pad thai like the two people I was with instead of the dish I wanted with the alteration. For $15 for a noodle dish you'd think they could make that happen. Plus there were only 2 choices, I found it rude for the server to not mention that I was ordered something else. Overall the pad thai was good and big enough portion to take half home. Also if you can handle spice the medium there is next to nothing. I'd recommend checking out Sabai Sabai over Sukho for sure."}
{"text":"This is solid comfort food if you are looking for Thai in Toronto. The restaurant is quaint, tucked into a small store front on Parliament street just south of Dundas. Pictures of customers who have visited Thailand adorn the front wall when you walk in. Sukho Thai restaurant is owned by a husband and wife team who also have a restaurant in Pai, Thailand, a small town in Northern Thailand close to the Myanmar border. Authentic flavours here, no ketchupy pad Thai. Varying levels of spice available for adventurous diners on the restaurant's concise menu. My brother had the Pad Thai with shrimp (add $1) and chicken with the spiciest level of chillies you could get. He was a fan. I had the Pad Kee Mao- a Chinese inspired Thai dish (from the Chinese people living in the north of Thailand) using broad rice noodles, soy sauce, oyster sauce, tofu, peppers and basil. The portion was big and the basil was fragrant. It really made the dish. I would go back to try some of the curries."}
{"text":"The Vegetarian Green Curry was incredible   I asked them to a little asian eggplants, snow peas with the Tofu Puffs.     They were very open to my requests  They even had a couple of lichee in it.   I wish I had taken a picture !   Presentation was excellent.   We took table D'Hôte ($28 person)  Friday night it had a nice crowd and nice clientele.  My girlfriend is vegetarian but I liked it and would eat this regularly!  Be sure to also order the Thai Salad!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely staff lunch at this place today. I had the veggie pad thai which was pretty good although I wish I had gone up a spice level (I had medium but think I could have handled spicy) - if you're a peanut fan this had a really nice hint of peanut in the sauce, but I did have to pick out the lemongrass because it was overwhelming everything else.   We also shared a plate of the spring rolls which were great, hot and fresh with a nice hum of spice in the filling.   For a cocktail, I had the \"ruby\", which is a delightful mix of lychee juice + Soho Lychee liquor and vodka (plus whatever makes it pink, I can't recall!) This is a really solid thai place, although it does get busy at lunch so think about making a reservation. Cocktails are a bit on the priceir side, but the lunch menu is a great price, and portions are large."}
{"text":"This place is overrated.   I tried their Khao Soi and Sukhothai Phad Thai - neither really stood out to me. Perhaps my expectations were set too high, but their dishes tasted just like that of any other thai restaurant.   I mean, the food is not bad, but it is definitely not worth the trip to Dundas East."}
{"text":"Longer wait time but the food came quickly. Not the best phad Thai ever but still decent enough .  Portions and sauce were perfect. But missing a lot of key ingredients. Might try the curry next"}
{"text":"The Food was amazing, we had Sukothai with a few friends over the weekend and it was delicious!   Pad Thai and Spring rolls were the real deal !"}
{"text":"Green Chicken Curry (Medium) is still my go-to dish. Creamy, coconut sauce with tender chicken breast, green peppers, bamboo shoots & basil. Perfect mix of sweet & spice. Good portion, doesn't skimp on ingredients!"}
{"text":"Oh baby, is this place ever freaking good!!  What an opener, huh? But hey, when it's this good, you just gotta' let people know!  Now, I know what neighborhood this is located in. I should anyhow, I lived there for almost 6 years. And I realize that 'character' might be a small understatement when it comes to the decorum of Regent Park. But things change, and one of the changes that has taken place in the hood is Sukothai. And that's a good thing.  I like to give reviews that I think everyone can find useful, so let me start by saying fan or not of Thai food, you should believe in this place. I've had  a few negative experiences here. My ex girlfriend and I once waited almost 50 minutes for our take out food here. The staff sometimes had a bit too much swagger to them. But general, they are on point here, they're friendly and the food is off the hook AWESOME. It makes you regret every other Thai meal you've had at any other Thai restaurant before you ate here. It makes you annoyed when you see Thai Express in the food court and they boast about their food. Please. Step aside, third rate.  I've had a few dishes here. Most of the time I order the Sukothai Pad Thai, medium spice with chicken and get the spring rolls on the side. It's something else. I've also had the Khao Noodle (sp?) and the coconut curry chicken on rice. All are outta' this world.  Lookit, I have to stop typing here. Talking about this place is just making me hungry for it and I'm gonna' start twitching if I don't get to eat some Sukothai soon. Just go, your stomach will thank you.  Side Bar: DO NOT go to the location on Dundas West. NOT GOOD. A shame it has to be the same name cause it ain't the same food. Parliament only, there are NO substitutes!"}
{"text":"From reading the yelp reviews, I was expecting the food here to match that of Khao San Road's. To my disappointment, the food turned out to be just OK.   I ordered my favourite Khao Soi dish but was immediately let down by the mediocre taste. I mean it's not bad, but it's not great and there was something amiss that I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe I happened to have a bad batch, but I can say that it is not comparable to its equivalent at Khao San.  If you are on the fence about going to either Khao San Road or Sukho Thai, I would recommend, 100%, to go with Khao San Road if it is not too out of the way."}
{"text":"Not very impressed.  A large group of us went for a meal here. We arrived quite late on a Friday night. They let us sit down and order, but to be honest you could see they had zero care factor in providing a good service.   The food itself was ok. I ordered the prawn rolls and red curry. Long after the order was placed, the waitress came out and said that they had no prawn rolls left. This theme continued with us being told after the fact food was not available. This then got worse when they forgot half our orders. Then to our astonishment they started carrying out some minor building work in the middle of our meal. Weird.  By this point we were really pissed off and asked for money off the bill, which in fairness was given.  This place has potential, however the rubbish service left us with a sour taste in our mouths. I would like to go back here for another try, but being as I live the other side of the world, I'm only left with the memory of a bad meal.  Granted we arrived quite late, but I would have appreciated being told service was over, rather than given a rubbish meal which we paid a lot for as a group. In my opinion, once you are allowed to sit, service standards should be the same no matter what time it is. Plus it was Friday night for Gods sake!   Overall must try harder."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in the city but I would not dine in - its more a takeout place. I was not impressed with their bathroom! They are very consistent with their food and delivery is pretty fast. The garlic chicken fingers are a must order!"}
{"text":"Food was very yummy ... Well at least my golden curry was. I tried the prawn chips with tamarind... Maybe the tamarind was a touch tool authentic for my pedestrian tastes but it definitely reminded me of. Hint of shrimp paste... A-la Filipino bagoong  ( fermented shrimp paste that tastes heavenly but smells horrendous)  Back to the pros... The golden curry was flavourful but not spicy... I'm sure you can get it butt burning hot but I'm a bit of of a wuss...  We got there around 1130 and by the time noon rolled around there was a lineup out the door.  I'd definitely recommend reservations if you're going during the lunch rush"}
{"text":"Had the chicken curry with noodle and it was just ok. I can make the same dish at home easily. Nothing special. We came here on a Friday this week and it was way too busy/packed during lunch time. Service was just ok and server was not that attentive. It took them 30-45 for our food to arrive, way too slow since we only had 1 hr lunch. The Phad Thai and Green Curry seems better."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai is the sister restaurant of Khao San Road, which came after and has a similar menu. Sukho then is equally as good as Khao, and the portion sizes are even larger it seems - it's just the setting is not nearly as nice. First of all, the resto is located in a pretty shady hood and the building itself is what could be described as a 'hole in the wall'. Quite a contrast to the modern, clean setting of Khao."}
{"text":"Love it here, get take out quite often but the service in restaurant is great too. I adore their yellow or red curry, as well as the Sukho Pad Thai with shrimp!"}
{"text":"Hate to do this,  but service has seriously been declining here over the years. Just had a really salty bowl of soup,  and the server would have known this had she bothered to check on me.  I had to ask for water twice on one of the hottest days of the year. And I'm still waiting on my bill..  Been waiting for 15 mins now,  while everyone is in the back chatting.  Disappointed since the owners are amazing.  Told them about the soup and was offered hot water.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends. Got here at 7pm and was told it would be a 30-45 min wait. We were seated at 7:40 and were rushed by the server to place our orders. An hour passed by and still no food. Was not offered any complimentary apps or drinks for the long wait.   At 8:45pm, server told us the food was being plated. 10 min passed and we finally got our food.   When we got the bill a 17% gratuity was added since there were 6 of us. Told the waiter we didn't feel we should pay for it due to the long wait. He said he couldn't do anything about it. We asked to speak to the manager and he said he was the manager. Then he walked away and came back saying he took off 10% from the bill.   Food itself was decent quality but service is extremely poor. Go to the parliament location unless you have a LOT of patience."}
{"text":"Yes. Best thai food in Toronto. I have never tasted khoi soi this good in my life. Even people from Thailand fly in to Toronto to try it. It's that good.  Okay that last part was a lie but seriously, all the items on their menu (limited items) are packed with their unique brand of flavor that sets it apart from all the thai restaurants I've tried in my life (includes NYC). And for the price? A steal. Authentic or not, you could argue however you want but one thing is true- this place is GOOD!"}
{"text":"Went into the restaurant and nobody even took our orders for 30 minutes. As we were walking out the owner asked us how our meal was and we told him that our order wasn't even taken. He seemed apologetic, but that was about as far as he would go. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Tried the shrimp pad thai but  it was waay too spicy. Garlic chicken  appetizer  was good though."}
{"text":"This place is teeny tiny, and they don't take reservations during the weekend, so just know that you'll be waiting a while if you decide to come here. That said, the food is pretty good! Not the best in TO, but it's no wonder why the lines are long and the uber eats take out counter is stacked with orders ready to be delivered.  Thai Iced Tea - BEST THING OF THE NIGHT! If you go and you don't order this... No. Whyyyyy?? Do it. 5/5  Garlic Chicken Bites - pretty good! Fantasticly crunchy and the dipping sauce is quite sweet. Nothing too special though 3.5/5  Mango Salad - yummy! It was really heavy on the fish sauce though, so if you ain't a fan of that... Skip this 4/5  Tom yum goong - man I was so excited for this but it was just meh. I'm not really a fan of the sweeter versions of this soup and this one is one of those. 3/5  Pad Thai - REAL GOOD. On point. Bravo. More peanuts please om nom nom 4.5/5  Khao Soi - okay y'all can hate, but this just didn't blow me away. The soup base, while tasty, is too rich... Making the whole portion hard to eat alone without feeling a little icky about it afterwards.The beef was super tender though, and the lime on the side is a MUST. It really cuts through the richness 3.5/5  Thai fried rice - gooooooood! Get the shrimp, I think it's worth the extra buck or two 4/5   Overall I would say the food's good, so you should definitely give this place a go. One note would be to ignore the warnings about the spice levels... We were scared into the medium spiciness level and I felt no heat. At all. But obviously, do as you wish! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty average Thai restaurant with trendy prices in the financial district.  One of my friends swore their parliament location was the best Thai in the city, but since it was closed temporarily, I ended up here, twice.  The FOOD: Big portions and big prices.  I can't say that there's anything to write home about here.  Good, but not great flavors.  Nothing terribly authentic.  Muted spice levels.  BTW, the Sukhothai pad Thai, is just how every other restaurant serves it...you're paying an extra $1 to get the herbs and condiments that are standard everywhere else.   The soups are decent but without that amazing rich taste you get at places that really work it with the galangal, lemongrass, and herbs...smaller portions. 3 stars.  The SERVICE: Adequate.  Bit slow, not fatal flaws though.  Not much enthusiasm. 3 stars  The ATMOSPHERE: I do not know what they are going for here.  They have a speaker set-up that looks like they're ready for a Metallica concert at a large outdoor venue.  The club beats were so loud last time that neither one of us could wait to escape.  The bar also has some pretty serious lighting design issues.  Overall, a rather dark, industrial space. -1 star.   I've given it two tries.  It is most definitely not the best Thai in Toronto...in fact, I don't think it's in my top 5...please message me if you can tell me where the best Thai is here!"}
{"text":"So, the food was pretty good and well priced. I had yellow curry and enjoyed it. The service however was very below what should have been. We could hardly get water. It took 30 min to get our food and I could tell it had been sitting. It's a Tuesday night so you would think that the kitchen could manage the business but it's not the case this evening."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had since Thailand!  I went on a bit of a Thai food tour in Toronto this fall and this was definitely my favourite.  Before I start, it's not a fancy place - just a small restaurant on Parliament street - so if you're looking for a classy dinner for a first date, it may not be ideal, but the food is amazing.   We had the shrimp chips with the tamarind dip to start, as well as some spring rolls, both of which were quite tasty.  I had the Beef Khao Soi for my main, and it was probably the best and most authentic Thai food I've had since I was in Thailand; it was the perfect mix of spices in the curry and reminded me of Chiang Mai.  I obviously loved it (so much so that I cannot even remember what my friend had) and highly recommend trying it.  Sukho Thai - incredibly delicious food at a very reasonable price. You should go. Maybe even right now."}
{"text":"The food is not bad.  We had a variety of dishes and they were all within the expectation of this popular and reputable Thai restaurant.   Service? Let's break it down:  1) don't expect to get much direct eye contact or acknowledgement when you ask for anything.  If you repeat yourself politely, an abrupt, \"ya, I heard you\" will be thrown back at you. 2) 2 people from our group did not arrive on time on a quiet work night before 6pm, but we were impatiently questioned twice within 15 mins about when we would be ready to order.   3) we didn't order our food immediately (again, while it's still quite quiet and empty in the restaurant) so we received a SARCASTIC remark from our server about how \"oh, you are in a hurry to leave too? Well, that makes it even easier for me!!\"  4) as a group of 8, we were obliged to leave 18% tips, so as we paid, we asked to speak to the manager regarding the rather rude service.  Plot twist: our server WAS the manager.   We left while wondering why we were made to feel like it's our own fault for getting such horrible service, was it because we chose to come to this restaurant?"}
{"text":"favourite thai place ever. not sure how mengrai gets all the hype that it does, i find sukhothai way better! can't think of anything to say that's different from he other 300+ raving reviews. uhm. yes the khan soi is delicious, the mango salad is awesome, the shrimp chips and tamarind sauce is a fun fizzy app to share, and the vibe is very down to earth and friendly. take out is really great too, had khao soi to go and they separated everything so when i got home and \"assembled\" it, it was almost exactly like eating it there! really great! oh if u uber eats this place they charge a premium cost cause it's so popular though"}
{"text":"Take it from someone who has lived in Thailand and loves Thai food...this is a good place to kick your Thai food craving. This place serves no nonsense Thai staples. I recommend the Khao Soi if you like a creamy curry based noodle soup. The Gaeng Kiaw Wan (green curry) is also super tasty! Remember to ask for fresh chilies to add to your dishes to control the level of spicy heat! Unfortunately the apps are mediocre and not that interesting."}
{"text":"I ordered fried rice with beef (mild) and Pad Thai. They were delicious and pretty good Pad Thai. It is very difficult to find Thai restraunt with good Pad Thai.  It was late dinner and people were flowing in after us and the lineup got longer.  I had to wait for 20minutes and servers were very friendly and hardworking. Very good food."}
{"text":"I once thought this place was great, but with my recent experience, I can no longer support their business. I now understand why they have mediocre review. It is because their customer service is garbage. I ordered for pickup through their affiliated app, Maegan on New Year's eve. Considering it was new year's eve, I was ok that my order took 45 mins to come out and I was ok that it was later than what Maegan quoted. What I was not ok with was that when there was a missing item in the order, they were no where to be found. I called and no answer. I contacted Maegan which contacted the restaurant and they received no answer. The take out food was already sub par as compared to our previous experience. The missing order was not even that much. It was the shrimp crackers with tamarind sauce which was only $5. It was more of the principle I was after. This is despite a pretty decent tip I put in on my order (10% on pickup). Completely unacceptable in my opinion. If you are looking to go to this place, take your money elsewhere. ISAAN DER on Keele and Dundas is soooooo much better! It's my go to place. At least they pick up when customers call."}
{"text":"First off, the line and wait was ridiculously long even with reservations. The wait area is terribly designed in the middle of the restaurant. Food was salty and the service is extremely bad and slow. When we complained to the \"manager\" about the service, he was basically arguing with us, instead of trying to resolve the issue. Would definitely not go there again."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 15, so the food took a bit longer to come. They were friendly enough to give us complimentary shrimp crackers though. The service was decent, waiters were polite.  I ordered the Khao Soi which I really liked. The curry soup was creamy, rich and authentically coconut-flavoured. The dish is also Instagram worthy! It comes with a tower of crispy fried noodles on top that eventually sinks down as it soaks up the soup.  Other people ordered the pad Thai, garlic beef, some other noodle soup, fried rice, etc.. I don't think my peers liked their orders as much as I liked mine, so I recommend all readers to get mine"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Thai place in this city. Or possibly my favorite Thai place anywhere, period. The only bad part is that Sukho Thai has ruined pad thai for me - theirs is so good that I can't bear to eat it anywhere else now. Seriously delicious. So delicious that I have to order exactly the same thing every time I go there. I always get it mild, but a friend of mine decided one time to try it spicy, and here's a warning - spicy means SPICY. He loves spicy food, but it was so spicy that he couldn't finish it.  Their tapioca with coconut milk for dessert is delicious as well, and the ambiance is pretty good, although it can take awhile for food to arrive. They also offer delivery, but only at set times throughout the evening, so you might have to wait an hour or two to get your meal. It's worth it, though. Having Sukho Thai's pad thai in the comfort of my own home = heaven."}
{"text":"It's EXCELLENT! Well worth getting over the location and small frontage - plus there's free parking on a side street right across from it - bonus!.  The recommended Pad Thai and Khao Soa were both amazing. So lusciously and fragrantly aromatic...... with a touch of heat. But just fresh tasting and lots of it - leftovers yeah!  We had reserved at lunch and they were full upstairs but opened up our own private dining room downstairs so don't be daunted by a full house, there's more space downstairs which is nice.  I'll be back with more friends. Thanks YELP! I wouldn't have found this without you!"}
{"text":"Went for a work team lunch, the environment and food were both excellent!  The waiter was witty and service was great.  Would definitely return in the future!"}
{"text":"I love the food, tasted better than any other Thai place in Toronto.  However the one star is given to the service & wait.  I have never ever came this close to leaving the restaurant before.  An hour wait for food is not acceptable!  Especially for lunch time :("}
{"text":"I really cute restaurant with good food. It's a very cozy environment really good for group hangout. Very authentic- price is good for dinner."}
{"text":"Ah, Sukho Thai. It's an unhealthy relationship. They'll keep us waiting for hours (literally, not figuratively; delivery often has a 2-3 hour backlog), but we tolerate it. Love the flavours, the textures (mmm chewy pad thai noodles), and the spice. I thought pad thai was a gross ketchupy mess until I tried it at Sukho Thai and now I am hooked. I haven't found another thai restaurant that I love as much as Sukho Thai. Even their sister restaurants are good, but not as good. Maybe I'm a masochist?  Now we live at Yonge and Eglinton and they won't deliver to our neighbourhood. We've debated renting a car just to pick up our order. I have flashbacks of Elaine Benes trying to pick up her food delivery from the street corner. We need a solution :|"}
{"text":"Great place to eat Thai food......Try their garlic beef fry......good quality food and great service.....Thai ice tea....also"}
{"text":"I've been to this Sukho a couple of times and regularly order from them off UberEats. They are very consistent performers, whereas I've had mixed results with delivery from Pai. The most recent time I came was a Friday night and I made a reservation because we were a group of 8. I'm glad I did because the place was packed to the max with scores of people waiting for tables in the entryway.  Being so busy the place was really quite loud but our server did a good job. Our group included my two vegan parents, myself and another friend as vegetarians, one gluten free and one pregnant (who wanted to avoid MSG and raw items). Our server did a good job answering questions about what each could order and I had confidence that the vegan dishes I shared with my parents would turn out as such. And, for the record we did have two dining companions with us who had no special dietary requirements!!   My parents and I shared veganized green curry and pad thai. Both were excellent. I really enjoyed the green curry and my parents raved about the pad thai. It was actually a huge dish but they managed to chow down on a lot of it. In fact, I don't think there were any leftovers. I also tried a vegetarian spring roll as my friend ordered a bunch and couldn't finish them all.  Since this visit to Sukhothai I've started hitting them up on UberEats and also tried the veganized versions of the red curry and panang curry. Out of those two I think I preferred the red. Yellow curry, you are next on my list! Also, useful note that the green curry portion size is much bigger than the red or panang when it comes to delivery. Interesting. Note: the masaman curry can't be made vegan and the satay sauce for the fresh spring rolls has fish in it.  Anywho, Khao San Road has been closed for so long that I've forgotten what it tastes like and Pai is extremely hard to get into. At this point Sukhothai is the strongest contender for my go to Thai fix. That green curry got a flavour that won't quit and I'm going to keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I went to Sukhothai with my friend Justin for an impromptu meal and as usual, it didn't disappoint.   When it comes to good Thai food in Toronto, there are only three places to go and they were all created by the same people: Khao San Road, Sabai Sabai and this one - Sukho Thai. Khao San and Sukho are basically the same place. Essentially the same menu and all.  We started with the garlic shrimp, which was a solid OK. Butterfly breaded shrimp with a sweet garlic sauce to dip. Nothing remarkable.   For anyone new to Khao San or Sukho, I want you to picture the best pad thai you've eaten. This is 50 per cent better. I opted for the Sukhothai veggie pad thai, which was loaded with noodles, tofu, julienne carrots, green onions, cilantro and their savoury 3-flavour pad thai sauce.  Nothing ketchup-y about it. So delicious and packed full of flavour.   The medium spice has a kick, but it's completely manageable. And the portion size is pretty big, so I brought some home for tomorrow's lunch.   Justin got the Khao soi which was also top notch. The coconut curry sauce is out of this world and any leftovers make for an awesome stir fry the next day.   Tip: Ask for extra veggie if you get the veggie pad thai. I really wanted some broccoli in there.   Tip 2: There are two pad thai's on the menu: Sukhothai pad thai and the regular one. Don't even question it. Just go for Sukhothai."}
{"text":"OMG -- our new fav \"go-to\" place for Thai food.  The Khao Soi is to die for - fantastic curry gravy --- and go for the beef -- it melts in the mouth.  They tell me that it is more popular than the chicken. My hubby says he wants their Pad Thai weekly.  In the time we are there -- it is revolving door for take out, and also the tables turn over quickly. Sure sign of a popular local spot.  Service is quick and friendly.  We'll going back next week."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. There isn't much to say other than great delicious food, good ambience, and friendly staff. I Always looking forward to my next visit. Beef Khao Soi is a must-try dish. It's super delicious."}
{"text":"One take out and one eat in experience.   Based on those two experiences, meh, is my overall impression.   Service is good but essentially they give off the sense they think they are a cool, hip restaurant but really, they are closer to cheap, average university fare.   Okay, far from great."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little Thai restaurant. We ordered the spring rolls - the non fried variety. It was even better than at good Vietnamese restaurants. Ordered 3 vegetarian curries - Green curry was outstanding. Massaman and Yellow were very good in flavour but had too many potatoes. The curry included rice in the price which makes this place very attractively priced. Ended with mango sticky rice which was also excellent. Be warned - the place is very small and the decor Spartan.  But the food is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken khao soi, the place was busy on a Friday night. Food is good, service is decent. The chicken khao soi has no vegetables, not sure if that is intentional or accidental. If I went back I would definitely pay extra for additional vegetables. Good enough since I'm in the area, but I prefer other Thai places in the city."}
{"text":"Not rating it completely 5 stars yet since I have only tried 2 menu options: Beef Khao Soi and Thai iced tea.   Overall the ambience was great! It's perfect for a date night as well as a family lunch/dinner. They do not take reservations so make sure to go there early. Weekends are always packed! Staff are pretty quick with food and please don't forget to bring an appetite. Their portions are fairly large.  Added bonus for me was that the meat was halal."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night around 6pm, it was already busy. We put our name on the list and came back around 6:30pm. It's a small place so make reservation or get there early.  We ordered spring rolls and sukho pad Thai and Khao soi. All were delicious. I found my pad Thai was a bit oily but still quite tasty!   By the time we finished, a big line up to get in. Felt a bit hurried to pay and leave."}
{"text":"One of the best pad thais I've had in this city, although I found that they might have overdone the sauce by just a bit. My companion had the khao soi and it looked amazing; his feedback was astoundingly positive.   The service was fine albeit slightly awkward and slow at times (maybe a slight language issue?). It took us awhile to get our drink order even though it was simply for tea and water. Food took a little while to arrive too but not a dealbreaker by any means.  I don't know what ambience they are trying to create but I find the restaurant unnecessarily dark and, coupled with the beats going off in the background, feels strangely more like a bar or pub than a Thai restaurant. I can understand that type of setting during dinner or happy hour, but for lunch? It's a bit bizarre. Place was almost full during a weekday lunch service so I shudder to think about how busy it gets during dinner and weekends. Setting was loud but never too loud to make conversation difficult.  Prices are a touch higher than what I'm used to paying for Thai food, and although the food is good, I'm a bit iffy on whether the premium is justified."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. It tastes good, but not too special. I've visited several times and have tried the curries and the noodle dishes. The feel of their noodles in the pad thai dishes are definitely worth a try, they are soft and fresh tasting.   I have a less-than-good feeling for this place because of the service. It takes a while to be acknowledged when you first enter the door. There have been times when a member of the staff is not in the process of serving customers or running the food, just standing by the bar, and yet we still received no acknowledgement. Some staff have always given me a sense of combativeness, which makes me want to ask questions or requests less.   For example, once I ordered some chicken appetizer and said I didn't need to have the appetizer to be coming early, and I wanted it to come at the same time as the meal. Instead of acknowledging my request and say something along the lines of they'll try, they gave me a whole spiel about how it was out of their kindness that they bring the appetizer early.  Also, during the course of that meal, another staff member came and removed one of our tables. I feel that this kind of service does not match the price we were paying for the type of cuisine.  For that, they also slapped a mandatory 17% gratuity.  There are much better thai restaurants around with more friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Curry was good and portion is pretty decent.  Long wait for table even though we made a reso."}
{"text":"Not a bad place and the food was ok with big servings but it lacked ...... authentic flavor I think. Also lunch was like $12 or $14 Plus tax so not cheap. Lunch with a beer and tip was $28 which was ok but I expected a tiny boutique place to have more authentic flavor for some reason. 6 out of 10. Likely it was off day and they can do better so might try it again soon."}
{"text":"Love love love loved this place!The Thai food was beyond expectations. I have never been to the east end to eat and when i was invited here by my friend to try this food I was in for a surprise. They do have several options and the servers are friendly and had some good suggestions to make.  I tried the Khao soi, green curry and red curry -- oh and it was oh so good! It was spicy and oh-so-delicious!  I will definitely be returning to eat it again and try their other offerings!"}
{"text":"An absolute must have!  While I live in Orlando, I am in Toronto every 4-6 weeks and when I can I make it here...it's mmmm mmmm good!  I should have written about this place long ago, but was just there and had their spicy pad thai...delish!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend. We didn't have reservations, but luckily we went pretty early (~5pm) and they let us stay (it was pretty empty when we arrived).  Love the food here! I'm Chinese so my idea of shrimp chips are the crispy, colourful ones you'd find at any Chinese restaurant. The shrimp chips at Sukho Thai, however...blew my mind. They're crispy, oh-so-very flavourful, and come with a tamarind sauce that just makes them perfect. And the garlic chicken. Need I say more? And those are just the starters. The pad thais and curries are always delicious! Definitely check them out.  The service is great, too. While we waited, we looked out the window and saw someone picking up their take out order. They drove up in a car, and made a server go outside in his t-shirt to hand the food over. Keep in mind this was mid February in Toronto, so it was FREEZING! The poor server had to stay out there for at least 5 minutes waiting for the customer to sort things out. I felt so bad, but that shows the dedication of the employees. After our meal was done, we decided not to get dessert. However, they served us complimentary ice cream! It was delicious - had some chunks of real coconut in it. After we paid, my boyfriend surprised me with a rose from behind his back. This was so strange, because I swear he didn't have one when we walked in! ...I was right. The server took care to hide it from me when he handed my boyfriend the bill (& rose)! They had an entire basket full of single roses to give to the girls for Valentine's Day. Small gesture, but it really enhanced the experience.  The one negative I'd have to point out is that they play the music really REALLY loud. Not the best for groups if you're looking to have some in-depth conversation. This doesn't take anything away from the food though so check it out, even if it's just for take out!"}
{"text":"Great food! I could not decide what to order so I went for the pad thai. I was not disappointed. Probably one the best pad thai dishes I've ever had however it was a bit on the sweet side. It was a huge portion as well, I had enough for two big meals. I also ordered the thai iced tea which was delicious. Service was great and prices are reasonable. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Sukho Thai has been quietly spreading it's empire across the city, and in my eyes, they can't spread fast enough. The food is always fast, tasty and well priced. The take out and delivery is always my go to, but I've done dine in as well.   This location is a bit smaller than some of their others, but does the trick for a nice casual meal. The mango salad and the Khao Soi are both the pick of the bunch for me. But you can't go wrong with their Pad Thai or any of their curries.  The next time you feel like a warming bowl of Thai spiced flavour, check out this place."}
{"text":"This is a quality Thai restaurant that packs a good deal. The Khao Soi is amazing and close to what I remember from my visit to Thailand. The guaytiaw soup was equally great!   There's tons of space and they offer reservations if you're fast enough.  Only downside is the open windows can cause a cold chill in the fall months."}
{"text":"Food is great. But really slow delivery. After trying a few different delivery companies, I think it is actually the restaurants issues. They probably only do hourly pick up for drivers or something.  Every item I've tried from their menu have tasted great. The Thai iced tea, guaytiaw soup, green curry, lemon grass fish are notable. Fried rice is only ok"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with colleagues last night. Here's what I/we had:  Shared:  - Crispy Spring Rolls  - Vegetable Fresh Rolls w/ Peanut Sauce  Main:  - sukhoTHAI Pad Thai w/ Shrimp  Drink:   - Mango Juice  The starters (rolls) came out pretty quick. Actually, it came out really really quick. The rolls didn't stand out too much - the crispy rolls were crispy and the fresh rolls were fresh.  In terms of the main - I had the pad thai. The portion was generous - too generous though. I am a pretty heavy eater and can usually finish a big bowl of noodles, but in this case it was very starchy tasting and really felt like it was sticking to my stomach. To add, the shrimps seemed to be overcooked - which really missed the mark with my expectations.  Maybe I'll stick to the Khao Soi that I had the last time I was there."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for 15 people the other day which was really just an excuse for me to try as many things on their menu as possible...and everything was amazing!   The surpise item that everyone LOVED was the Pla Taud (Fish Platter)...I was lucky to get a small piece before it vanished. Not something I would usually think to order but glad I did...highly recommended!!  All the curries and noodles were cooked to perfection and were a big hit with everyone. My personal favorite of the curries was the Masaman with the Panang Curry running a close second. The Red Curry with squash seemed to be another crowd favourite.   I have no issues with the location or the ambiance...personally, i think it adds to the charm of this restaurant but I have to agree (and share in the pain) of others who have had difficutly getting a real person on the phone to order take-out. They truly tested my patience but I eventually managed to have my order taken. The good news is that the order was prepared right on time. It probably helped that it was a Tuesday night and not quite as busy as usual. A few weeks ago I tried to order takeout on a Saturday night and was told they just couldn't do it as they were too busy. If this happens to you...don't get mad...just take a deep breath and call/visit earlier next time! It's well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Rave reviews put this little thai resto on our must-try list. So we went. Oh la. Spicy & flavourful...just the way we like it. Masaman curry was delicious. Fragrant & sweet, with a heat that lingered. High expectations for the red curry. Will always be that way after Mengrai. And...it was close.  Stand-out dishes: Gaeng Masaman {Masaman curry with peanuts, potatoes, onions, shallots, coconut milk & tamarind sauce}  Gaeng Phed {Red Curry with squash, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, red & green pepers & coconut milk - with tofu}  Sukhothai Pad Thai {Authentic stir-fried rice noodles in a light tamarind-based sauce with a choice of chicken, beef, tofu or shrimp}  Honourable mentions:  Gaeng Panang {Panang curry with kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, red and green pepers and coconut milk. Choice of chicken, beef or tofu and served with rice}  Spring Rolls {Crispy vegetarian rolls with glass noodles, mushrooms, carrots & beansprouts. Served with a sweet & sour garlic sauce}"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I ordered the Sukho pad thai. Really flavourful and extremely large portion! Perfect balance of noodle to sauce. My friend ordered the Khao Soi noodles and she found that there was a lot of curry broth relative to the noodles.  Customer service was spectacular. The waitress came back every now and then to ensure our glasses were filled with water.  The restaurant was dimly lit. I felt that it could have been a little brighter. Otherwise, no real complaints."}
{"text":"We've loved getting takeout from this Regent Park Thai place and have tried most of the dishes, which are uniformly delicious. Sukho Thai has been our longtime default favorite when we can't think of what to have for dinner.   But the other day I found a 2-inch piece of knotted cotton string or twine in my spring roll and almost choked on it. Not pleasant, and potentially dangerous.  We'd ordered the food via Ubereats, and when asked for feedback, I wrote to them about this problem. Never received any response from Ubereats or Sukho Thai.   This has made me hesitant to order from Sukho Thai again. Looking for a new Thai place."}
{"text":"A little rain won't stop me from coming here after hearing all the positive reviews.  I arrived yesterday at around 1:30pm, and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. However, I agree that the place is horribly understaffed. During the time I was waiting for a table, there were no less than 8 people who came in to order take out! With only two ladies on hand to serve, nobody came to clean my table until about 10 minutes after I was seated. They explained how it was a busy day with several people ordering take out/delivery due to the rain, and I understood (though hinted that they should have more staff).  In terms of food, I ordered the pad thai, mild. I considered their sukho pad thai, but $13 was a slightly steep price for the budget I had that day...perhaps next time. Anyway, the pad thai was extremely delicious! The noodles were chewy, just the way it should be (I hate it when the noodles fall apart so easily). The sauce was just the right amount and delicious as well, and it was just the right amount of spiciness I can take. I was even impressed that the portion was quite large; I sort of expected quality where quantity is a little lesser than normal, but I only barely finished it. At the end, I ordered veggie fresh rolls to go, as I figure I would give them a bit more money since they were so overwhelmed yesterday.  Definitely a place I would recommend, on par with Khao San Road (of course, they're sister branches, but still)."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice atmosphere. Doesn't really matter what you order, you can't go wrong! If you like Thai, this one is a must-try. Definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Delicious food. They're always packed with a line for seating and you can never get an answer on the phone for delivery/pickup. A bit annoying but just goes to show how good the food is. This one is not as nice of an atmosphere as the one on Wellington but it stands way above other choices in the Dundas & Parliament area."}
{"text":"To be very honest I always stick to the Thai fried rice and panang curry(I wish it had more curry) at this spot. Tried the pad Thai before and that was pretty good too. If you don't manage to get a reservation at Pai, Sukho Thai is a must try!!! (Wow that really rhymes )"}
{"text":"I was the first to arrive from our party at 6 on a Saturday night. At this time, I was the only patron sitting in this very small establishment. Looking at the 'Reserved' card on our table, I thought that making a reservation was completely unnecessary ... boy was  I wrong. As my dinner companions started to arrive, so did other patrons of Sukho. Within a half hour, the restaurant was completely filled and there were no empty tables. The weather wasn't too nice with sporadic rainfalls along with strong winds, but something must have been a hook for all these people to come thought I.  I was quite impressed with the food selection and found everything to be delicious (and reasonable).   The spring rolls were crispy with heaps of meat-less fillings. I especially liked the accompanying dipping sauce as it added a little 'kick' to the spring rolls. We also ordered the deep-fried, breaded garlic chicken as an appetizer. These dishes went well with our Thai Iced Teas that we ordered.   As my main, I ordered the Gaeng Masaman, which was so, so, so good. I have had Thai curries where the ratio between the coconut milk and curry sauce was completely out of proportion. Fortunately, the different flavors within the curry was well-balanced to result in a delicious meal.   We were completely stuffed that ordering dessert was not possible... next time, though.  The food is fabulous at Sukho Thai and I have nothing, but praise for it. Sukho isn't situated in the best of neighborhoods so hopefully when they expand, there will be locations that don't have me sketched out.   The service was on the slower side. Having to ask for a couple of things twice or thrice was also somewhat annoying. In addition, I ordered the Shrimp Chips and it never managed to arrive.   Change the location and speed up the service so that Sukho Thai will be a five star in my books ~"}
{"text":"Bit overrated: Ordered Ubereats:  Khao Soi--Beef - noodle dish w curry beef. beef was way too chewy. tossed half of it  --Fresh Rolls - not bad Tom Yum Kung - broth too thick bit expensive not all that"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and find the food excellent here. I highly recommend the Khao Soi and Pad Thai which are both my favorites. Most of their appetizers are pretty tasty too!  You should also probably get a Thai iced tea while you're here, always a treat.  The location is in an older part of the city and not really noticeable. Nothing special with the interior.  Overall, I'd recommend and I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! The ingredients are so fresh. The masaman curry has a flavor unlike anything I've ever before experienced. They've recently opened up a new location on Wellington that unlike this Parliament location is in a posh area (that in my opinion has equally delicious food), but this location on Parliament remains fantastic and a classic."}
{"text":"Sukhothai was my go-to. I've had dinner here for take-out or dine-in the most out of any Toronto restaurant in the past year. It's a short walk from my place and I've enjoyed nearly all the food that I get from there. Decor is awesome too. However, my experience from last night was...  CRAMPED TABLE First, I was glad that they were able to accompany us, a party of 6, into a usually 4-person table by adding 2 more foldable chairs. It was a little cramped but given it was a Friday night, we understood. We apparently had taken the reservations of 4 guests who didn't show up.   TOOK THEIR TIME The food took about 40 mins to come. This is not the first time Sukhothai took so long, so I was kinda used to it.  CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT A PRIORITY When the food finally did come, our server mixed up one of the orders and I asked for it to be taken back delaying us eating for another 5 mins. He came back saying he did write down the right order (good for you buddy!), just didn't bring out the right one.   It's only fair for me to mention that at this point, our server notified us of that he'll only bring one bill for parties of 6 or more and that tip will already be included.   VERY NITPICKY PAYMENT METHODS  (I.e. Waiter who is just itching to get out of his shift) My friend asked the waiter for a take-out order. Get this: the server refused to take it and told my friend to walk over to the take-out waiter by the cashier and order there. Apparently, for some reason, it has to be a different transaction for the same customer in the same restaurant.  Now, we were fine with one bill. In other places though, we'd do the math from the one bill and we'll each get our credit cards charged. But nope...waiter said, \"Our policy is one bill which obviously means one transaction otherwise why would we have only one bill?\"   RESTAURANT MANAGER ASKED US TO LEAVE After our food took forever to come, we ate normal pace and chatted. We weren't being loud or disruptive in any way. The manager interrupts us saying that we have to go because other people who reserved are waiting. He was kicking us out. My friend who ordered take-out over half an hour ago still hasn't gotten his food. So we stayed there for another half an hour until he got it. The whole time the manager took every chance he could to give us his crazy eyes look lol.   Summary: Self-righteous waiters who hate their jobs and take out their misery on customers Terrible managers who kick customers out of their seats once they've paid and stare them down evilly if they don't go. Great Thai food which can be eaten from other restaurants nearby with much better customer service (Thai Dish, Sabai Sabai, Khao San Road, Pai Northern Thai)"}
{"text":"Comparable to Khao San Road, but I enjoyed the pad thai I had at Khao San more than the khao soi I had at Sukho.  I might just not be a big fan of the yellow noodles (egg noodles..?), and I wasn't sure what to do with that crispy topping so I dipped it in curry... and it tasted funny.  Unfortunately :(  However, while the chicken was sparse it tasted delicious with the curry, which was sweet and slightly spicy (I requested medium)   There is also coriander in this dish but even if you are one of those really averse to its flavour you can just pick it out :P Can't taste it in the actual curry   My friends' panang and pad thai looked delicious though.  I would probably go back to try those next time I'm on Wellington"}
{"text":"Classy thai restaurant with good vibe. It was very packed for a weekday but excellent service and food."}
{"text":"The food was very well made so tasty and yummy.nice staff Try the coconut shrimp soup soooooo gooood"}
{"text":"This is a classic case of a business letting its success getting to its head. I live nearby and have subsisted on Sukho Thai's takeout for a while now. The flavors are decent: Pad Thai is inconsistent, but Pad Kee Mao and Pla Taud are superb; portion size is respectable. Dine-in is super cramped so I avoid it unless I'm super desperate. Now, the beef I have: lunch cutoff time on Maegan is 2:15, and nobody at the restaurant ever picks up the phone, so even though technically they can still whip up a Pla Taud before 3pm, unless you walk in, you're screwed. Very rigid and unfriendly to customers. Secondly, 2 wks ago I paid $14 for a dish, all of a sudden today it's $16. Guys, you're in Regent Park. Come on. Your worth lies in quality and value. I'm done with this place for now. Ubereats and Foodora can take over all they want."}
{"text":"Went back after it was renovated . The menu is short and sweet but that doesn't make it any easier to choose from it cause everything looks good on it . Hard a hard time choose from pad thai and curries . Just means I need to go back some time ! End up having Khao soi I have had tried this dish in many Thai restaurants and I expected to be rich . Rich curry  sauce with egg noodles crispy noodles for garnish  and braised beef . The beef was tender and also has some texture to it . The flavor is complex with lots of layers I had to ask for extra lime wedges and coriander to help cut down the richness of the dish.  Which lighten it up big time I did some research afterwards saying not suppose to finish the sauce . Well that make sense it's like 35% cream with lots of butter kind of rich. Luscious creamy home made curry sauce . I'd say this is one of the best Khao soi I ever had.  Very happy with their new menu would pay next visit soon !"}
{"text":"What the hell.  So I made an order on ritual, which after I put it through told me that it would take 35 mins instead of 20mins. So I walked in and there was a seat at the bar. I told the hostess and asked for the food to be delivered to the bar and said I would order additional things. Sat down ordered a garlic shrimp and a glass of wine. Hostess comes over and says free soda is only with take out so if I want it i need to pay. I said that's fine.  I don't care about the free soda, I have wine. Then she comes over again and says if you order take out you can't eat in. To which I said, I'm ordering additional items (which by the way, cost more than what I originally ordered, so sitting in actually benefits them), what's the problem? Spoke to their manager and he was again reiterated that he was doing me a favour by allowing me to eat here. Who treats their customers like this? Are you worried about not being about to include the ritual order on your service charge? Thanks for ruining my meal and ensuring that I will NEVER come back. Pai is a much better alternative anyway."}
{"text":"I really like the food here but I probably won't come for a while. It's always packed and noisy as fuck. And you need to wait a long time for a table.   But food rating is a solid four."}
{"text":"I had a Khao Soy here and I can tell you that's a load of curry that you never thought you would enjoy. The place is nice but the service is a little on the slow side. Slow enough to cost them one star in my review."}
{"text":"I ordered the khao soi with chicken and it was delicious. The curry was very rich, which paired nicely with the crunchy noodles, giving it some extra texture and dimension to the dish.  To pair up the meal I also ordered a Thai iced tea, which if you haven't tried before, I would definitely recommend! It's a combination of the refreshing iced tea but also the richness and milkiness that you find with milk tea. It was a very interesting drink that pairs nicely with spicy food.  The customer service was spectacular, the staff was friendly and provided great suggestions. I would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my friends after attending the Gourmet Food & Wine Show on Sunday, where Chef Nuit cooked. My friend watched her and raved about the dish she made, so I had to try it.   Items Ordered: Spring Rolls, Phad Thai, Khao Sol, Tom Yum Kung with rice, Yellow Curry with Beef  The spring rolls were fresh and tasty, though I think I prefer the vietnamese style more (I guess i like some pork in my spring rolls!). I had the Khao Sol, which is the dish Chef Nuit made at the show, and I liked it. It was sort of sweet with a nice coconut taste. My friend said the Phad Thai was a bit dry, and it was, but I did like the flavour of it, and it's different from other Phad Thai's that I have tried. The curry was a take-out for my boyfriend and he liked and found it very filling... so much so that he feel asleep afterwards!  Overall, I thought the food was solid here, and the service was good. However, I guess after all the rave reviews I had heard, I was expecting to be blown away, but wasn't. But I would definitely go again if I was ever in the neighborhood, and order from it... if only they delivered to my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"3.5/5. I frequently order from Sukothai at work and my go-to's are the Khao Soi or Pad Kee Mao. However, I have not visited this location in a while and actually tried something new this time around. Normally I've heard it gets quite packed during dinner time but we came on a Monday and it was quite empty. I the soup noodles (guay tiaw) with beef and was pleasantly surprised. The broth was very tasty and they gave a generous amount of beef. I was expecting pho beef but instead there was very tender beef chunks. For my drink, I had to order my favourite - Thai milk tea! I found it a bit too sweet and had too much ice. Overall, food was good but I thought service was very mediocre. The waitress came up and asked us if we wanted to pack the food very early on in the meal which was quite rude."}
{"text":"Although the previous reviews are inconsistent and varies, I had a decent experience.   I came here on a Friday night, and was seated and served pretty quickly. The place had some cute Asian decor but certain lighting (neon) and techno/house music did not match. While I ordered the chicken with peanut sauce and crispy spinach, my partner ordered the classic chicken pad thai along with a 10$ appetizer/sides of mango salad, 2 imperial rolls and 2 dumplings. The food arrived pretty quickly, the appetizer first then the main course right after.   Although the small mango salad and dumplings were pretty good, but the imperial rolls lacked flavour and tasted like the frozen packaged rolls you can buy in Asian grocery stores. The best dish was the chicken with peanut sauce served with rice and crispy spinach, having a very generous portion and flavourful sauce. The chicken padthai was a fail, although it came in a big portion, the dish lacked Thai flavours and instead tasted somewhat a mixture of ketchup.   I'm giving this visit 3 stars because the padthai was a fail, the ambiance of the restaurant was confusing and the price of certain dishes were not worth it. But on a good note, our service was quick and if you were to come visit, the chicken with peanut sauce is the best choice!"}
{"text":"Great pad Thai, super spicy and delicious. However, they are literally the slowest take out spot in the city. You should never get take out. Only go if youre planning to drink while you wait an hour for something as simple as pad Thai. Also, really slow delivery service. That's why they get the low rating."}
{"text":"My second time here since 3 years ago! Nothing really changed much, the food is pretty good and service is pretty fast too.  I ordered chicken Pad thai and it's a bit too sweet but still tasty. The shrimp chips' still a bomb!! Super good! Thai ice tea is my all time favourite.   Will definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get Khao soi beef in the city. I like it so much I also order delivery through the Maegan app.   Okay, we ordered the shrimp chips, garlic chicken nuggets, khao soi (noodles in curry gravy) beef, and cashew chicken. So like I said, you MUST order the Khao soi. You won't regret! The cashew chicken is surprisingly delicious too. Everything else was decent. And you can't go wrong with Thai iced tea. Service was good."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for an opportunity to go to this restaurant! After an afternoon at the Distillery District, my boyfriend and I walked to this restaurant to try out some authentic Thai food. I got the Sukho Thai Pad Thai which has a more unique I think sour flavour to it than the regular Pad Thai. My boyfriend got one of the curries and absolutely loved it. He was not accustomed to the unique flavour in my Pad Thai and didn't liked it but I absolutely enjoyed my dish! I also thought that his curry was very flavourful. Maybe I don't have expert taste bud but I do not find that the food here tastes any better than non authentic Thai food places. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my experience here and I would love to come back here!"}
{"text":"I've tried their red curry, gaeng masaman, spring rolls, and fried chicken appetizer, and sukko pad thai.  everything was standard except for their fried chicken appetizer and sukko pad thai (NOT their regular pad thai) were amazing!!!!  it's a bit on the pricier side for thai food though.  i've been there a few times now and their service has been superb so star."}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of a friend (who actually recommended the other location, but we were near here).  When we walked up to the door and heard Yeezy I knew that it wasn't going after an authentic thai experience, but I'm open to modern thai as well so we went in.  The restaurant is dark with an industrial feel which actually fit the music pretty well.  It wasn't particularly crowded, but had the feel of a place trying to be a scene (perhaps more likely at night, but we were here for lunch).  We promptly were given a menu to look over.  Truth is it has a very stripped down menu, again nothing wrong with that if you do everything well.  We ordered a mango salad, pad ke mao, and a red curry with vegetables.  Mango salad: Had no heat, no real acidic kick, mostly just a plate of diced mango with fish sauce and a few tomatoes (no peanuts either).  I like mango and I didn't hate this, but it wasn't anything special and I'd never order it again.  Pad ke mao (tofu) - We ordered this dish medium and it really had no heat (though the partner seems to disagree and says it had some). It came with thin pad thai noodles instead of the wide rice noodles that you usually get. It also didn't have the strong basil taste that I usually love about this dish.  It was ok, but nothing great.  Red curry with vegetables - The curry itself was tasty, though a bit thin.  It didn't really stick to the vegetables and this was made worse by the shape of the serving dish.  It was in a very long flat dish so there was nothing submerged and it was hard to actually scoop the curry onto your plate or onto your rice.  The veggies were slightly underdone.  Squash was a bit off (hard or mealy, depending on which of us you believe), and the cauliflower slightly underdone.  Nice flavor on the curry sauce but it just didn't work.  After being attentive to start the waitress promptly ignored us after we ordered.  (Our section actually closed down in the middle of our meal so I think this was part of it). Our dishes came out at different times and our curry, which came out much later, was not super hot when it did arrive. It was also difficult to flag down our check to leave.   Finally, the prices were high and the portions were small.  We easily killed off $40 worth of food for lunch and it wasn't worth that.  It definitely has an ambiance, but I wouldn't be willing to pay for it again."}
{"text":"We usually get take-out from the one on Parliament - this place was not the same quality - the thai fried rice was bizarre, a big mound of rice with nothing in it, and I mean nothing, it was just rice,did they forget stuff??? Mango salad seemed to lack any dressing, was just sliced up mango with a bit of chilli - beef curry panang - grisly overcooked beef and a far too sweet sauce....and the pad kee mao, overcooked and limp vegetables. won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm from San Francisco and I've has my fair share of thai food.  I had the Pad Thai with chicken and it was       the most flavorful pad Thai ever.  My cousin loved his beef soup as well."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place. It wasn't that busy the two hours before the lunch hours were over. I ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp. Huge portions!  Well worth the 20 dollars (after tax) spent. Couldn't finish it so I took left overs home. It was the best pad thai I've ever had."}
{"text":"Ordered the dinner sized tom yum soup which came with rice, while my friends got the khao soi. The tom yum was really good, a little sweeter than i expected, but comforting with a bowl of white rice. It was surprisingly filling as well. I tried my friends khao soi which was also good, a little heavier, but very flavourful. The chicken in the khai soi was nice and soft and not dry. Service was lovely and our food arrived relatively fast. Ive also had the fried fish dish here with the mango salad another time, and that was delicious!"}
{"text":"Try the cocktails - mojito - ruby has lychees - yum - not normally pad Thai fan but you MUST order the pad Thai. Curries yummy too."}
{"text":"Great food! I've tried all their curries, their pad Thai, and thai fried rice. I love their curries and they have the best pad Thai I've tasted. Never disappointed by the food. Great ambiance. Window seat has a nice view of the street.  Only downside is that it gets super busy sometimes and there's a decent wait to get a table but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Note: don't come here during the lunch rush.   I came here with 2 friends on a Friday around 12:30pm, and it was packed! We had to wait half an hour to get a table. But the food came out quickly, and it was pretty delicious.  Two of us had had the Sukhothai pad thai with tofu ($14), and the other person had the mango salad ($6). We all ordered Thai iced teas ($4) as well. My meal was definitely worth the price, and my friends I was with have been to Thailand before and said the iced tea was very authentic.   Anyway, I'd definitely come here again. Just not during peak hours. :)"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and consistent. Although on more than one occasion I've had to wait for my food while my dining companions ate theirs (and in some cases finished). There was an instance where I ordered spring rolls to go and had to wait an extra 30 min after finishing our meal. We even watched as other tables got their spring rolls. The poor service is not on par with the great food."}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this place for a while after everyone I know recommends it all the time. Finally back in Toronto and I went with a co-worker. It's open late, great atmosphere, nice mix of people and the service was spot on. Loved the food, lots of nice portions to share. Recommendation - order every kind of curry. Worked for us and we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite dining experiences here in Toronto, during a far too quick 4 day stay,......very clean flavors that shine thru and a staff that is friendly and very accommodating, they will make you food exactly how you want it.......... hope they can manage to work their possible upcoming schedule conflicts to keep a great little restaurant with awesome food going strong.  They have a tiny kitchen and have to cook each order individually and to order, so make sure you call in advance or have a little patience...but good food is always worth waiting for and this fantastic restaurant is no exception."}
{"text":"I read the reviews,but still ventured in with 13 people including children. I was pleasantly surprised that the service was really good! They gave us a private room downstairs and totally hooked us up. The tom kha gai was wonderful! We ordered quite a few dishes and they all arrived pretty much together and were all warm.   Danielle P.. give them another chance!  p.s sooo soo much better than salad king!!!"}
{"text":"I really like that Sukho Thai takes reservations!  Food was tasty although a bit pricey. The red curry was very good and extra spicy is a nice, comfortable spice for those who like heat. Staff was friendly and pretty chill.   I don't know if I'll go out of my way to come again but I would definitely suggest it to a friend looking for Thai food."}
{"text":"Best green curry ever. Aloy mak mak. I go here a few times a month.  The service is prompt and friendly and the older Thai lady that works there is hilarious.  I lived in Thailand for 2 years so I was excited to find some delicious authentic green curry in the city. The khao soi is also to die for, the beef is so tender and the sauce is rich and perfectly spicy."}
{"text":"I made reservations here 2 months ago for a group of 6 people. We had a basketball game to watch (NBA) at 7:30pm, so considering the proximity, I thought we had just enough time to eat and then uber over.   We got to the restaurant at 6pm and ordered all our food right away. By 6:45pm, none of our food was here, so I asked the waitress to check up on our food. At this point, I was getting anxious and was watching the clock because I really did not want to miss watching the Raptors. I kept on asking our waitress and she insisted that our food was coming. My friend even suggested getting up and walking out of the restaurant because we've been waiting almost an hour for our food.  Finally, at 7:15pm, all our food comes out. I scarf down my bowl of soup and we finished within 15 mins and asked for the bill.  Our waitress gives us ONE bill (because apparently for a group of 6, they don't split the bill) AND there's a mandatory 18% tip, which is ridiculous. Not only did we wait 1 hr 15 mins for our food, there's a mandatory tip imposed on us. She also didn't tell us about the mandatory tip, so my friend, who paid the bill by card, almost tipped on top of that before I stopped him.  TIP FOR SUKHOTHAI (and plenty of other restaurants who do this): DON'T force mandatory tip upon your customers, esp. after they waited over an hour for their food. They will resent you for it.  The food itself was medicore, so there is no reason to ever come back.  Note: I realize it was not the waitress' fault that it took so long for the food to come, but to the customer, they do not care (I actually worked as a waitress for 2 years). The customers tip based on the overall experience, so expect less tip if the kitchen staff is slow - that's just how it is."}
{"text":"Food is great here but the good luck trying to get a table. Hostess says about 25 mins and been waiting for more than 45 mins and there are more than 3 tables open. She said its for reservations, but no one coming to claim the tables or doesn't even have a reservation tag. While everyone is just standing around waiting and waiting but tables still not getting filled ... Honestly they need a better system here. Not a happy camper. Make sure you either make reservations and hope you'll get a seat or just order take out!   Update: empty seat was vacant for 30 mins and now the hostess finally puts us at the exact table.. Like wtf!"}
{"text":"This place is like a bad Thai joke. I mean what kind of curry looks like watery soup with swimming oil on top? Ugly. I ordered veggie and tofu curry (they did not have Pineapple Curry) that arrived almost an hour late and the food was not as expected. The curry had rarely any veggies, mostly hard tofu pieces and hard pumpkin. Yuck. The sauce was very watery and bland. We also asked for extra peanut sauce for Fresh Rolls but they included only a tiny amount - half of the small one. So disappointing. Note to myself - never order from here again."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Khao San Road, and frequented there often. It still is the best pad thai I have ever had, and I am completely addicted to their Khao Soi. Because of this though, when I went to try Sukho Thai, I could not try something new as I had to get my Khao Soi with beef fix. It tasted the exact same as the Khao San Road dish, and the only thing different was the shape of the bowl. The space seems to be a decent size, and on a Friday night I didn't have to wait for a table! The more places that are serving up this quality of food in the city is a good thing. I'm not sure why people aren't showing this place the love on yelp because it is just as good as Khao San Road. Oh, we also got the puffed shrimp chips which come in a very generous portion, and the tamarind sauce that comes with them is quite yummy. The flavour of the shrimp without the sauce was quite overpowering for me though."}
{"text":"Food was good and the flavour was present, which is not a surprise because they are part of the Pai family but of course when people decide to begin an empire and do multiple locations the food is never as good as the original and so Sukho Thai is just a little shy of the food at Pai. Still, everyone thought their food was good to very good. My Gaeng Kiaw Wan (green curry) with bamboo shoots was good. Another good things is that one can choose the level of spiciness (medium had no spice I would say though and spicy is too hot!) and choose shrimp, beef, chicken or tofu. Options is good. This reminded me of the system at Bombay Bhel.  Quantity-wise the food was just right and no one left hungry. On the down-side they were out of Tum Yum soup on a Tuesday noon.  They lose points for service. Being left standing at the door for a few minutes with no acknowledgement is not caring at all. There was no quality check or follow-up either. Not to make excuses for them, but they looked understaffed as we only saw two waitstaff, a man and a woman. Smiles and politeness are likely extra as they were not forthcoming.  They lose another point for the washrooms. It was not very clean and the floor was sticky. That alone is always the second biggest turn off."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant by walking down the street in our first cold night in Toronto. We had soup and curry beef with jazmín rice. The food is delicious, the service is fast and very attentive. I will definitely come back if we visit Canada in the future."}
{"text":"Had the curry lunch special today. It was so bland!! it was just chicken in coconut milk, no thai basil, no taste of coriander, no kafir lime, no spices..nothing! I couldn't even tell what type of curry it was: red or green.. or maybe they invented a new \"white\" curry :) It was bland and it was awful."}
{"text":"I've been told that Sukho Thai Parliament is the original location of this 3 location restaurant. The restaurant itself is very small and cramped inside, and the feel is a little more old. If you're seated near the front (narrow hall), you will get the occasional breeze of cold air from the door opening.  The food itself was okay. I tried the Shrimp Chips - they are basically a bunch of deep fried crackers that are puffed and light. I did have plenty of chips left over and the staff kindly brought extra sauce in a to-go cup to pack it with.  For dinner, I had the Gaeng Phed (Red Curry) with Chicken at spicy level. Everything tasted fine but tasted like every other Thai restaurant I've tried. Curry tasted good and the squash was soft but the dish was not anything to remember."}
{"text":"I was delighted by their menu and the warm lighting in the restaurant. The service was fantastic the whole way through and our server didn't rush us even though we took our own sweet time.   I tried the spring rolls as a starter and they were perfect. Not too oily and the filling had vermicelli which was really cool. For my main I tried a noodle soup that came in a very flavourful broth and a generous amount of vegetables.   Everyone I was with had vegetarian foods and we were all delighted by how perfect the food was.   It's the perfect place to go as a group and relax and enjoy! Love the variety they have for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"*Sukho Thai is sorta the more upscale version of Pai, which is actually their sister restaurant!  *The prices here are definitely higher and the ambiance isn't as casual or street-style like Pai.   -shrimp fresh rolls w/ peanut sauce - $8 I liked how well crafted the rolls were, I mean, don't you hate it when the rolls fall apart while eating?! I would have liked it more if the vegetables were pickled or there were more seasonings on the shrimp to add more flavors, or more heat in the peanut sauce would be even better!  -sukhoTHAI mango salad - $6 I was fairly disappointed with the mango salad from Sukho Thai. The mango was soggy and limp, and it was too sour as well. The salad didn't have the balance between the sweetness and acidity of the lime juice, nor did it have any heat from the chilies.  -gaeng kiaw wan(beef green curry w/ bamboo shoots, Thai basil, green peppers) - $14 The beef pieces were very tender and soaked up all the curry flavors. However the curry arrived lukewarm, the consistency was quite watery and in term of taste, it was not as flavorful as the one in Pai. There was less curry paste and there should be a bit more coconut milk to add a nice touch of sweetness. I was also surprised to see how mild this dish was! In general green curry is the spiciest out of all the curries (Red is second then Yellow), and I ordered spicy so they seriously toned down the heat of this a lot.  -Thai fried rice - $13.50 My friend said it was just a typical fried rice, nothing special."}
{"text":"When I went for dinner tonight with two others we all had a good experience. I will start by saying that our server was great, very personable and informative.  We ordered the garlic shrimp, fresh rolls and soup to start. All delicious and fresh tasting!! To share as entre we had the Pad Thai and another dish I forgot the name of. We ordered medium heat because she recommended but quickly asked for hot sauce seeing as it wasn't spicy enough.  Overall a great experience,  and my next visit will sure be at the original location on Parliament."}
{"text":"This place is in my top 3 for favourite Thai spots in Toronto... next to PAI and Khao San Road. Quality is great for the price you are paying. I come here whenever I'm in the area. The Khao Soi here is the best I've tasted yet. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've overlooked the customer service to enjoy the quality of their food for the past few years... The time has come where even their quality of food will not bring me back.   Over the past few years there have been a few instances where their customer service could have been better, last night unfortunately was the last straw.  I ordered pickup for myself and two others and was told that it would be 1.5 hour wait... It seemed like a much longer wait than usual, however, I discovered that they were recently added to the new Uber app. It made sense that there would be an increase in volume.   I showed up at 7:25PM (order pickup time 7:30PM) and was informed it should be a few minutes. I left the restaurant with my food at 7:45PM, little did I know this was not the end of our interaction. Upon arriving home at 8PM, I discovered that it was an incomplete order and two sides were missing. I attempted to call them a number of times but due to their volumes was unable to get through to anyone at the restaurant. I departed my condo to receive the rest of my order upset and hoping that they would be able to make it up to me and retain my business.  Upon reentry to the restaurant it was evident that the volume was catching up with the individual working take out as she seemed flustered and not in the best spirits. I realized that it was no fault of hers that my order was incomplete and was as calm as possible. I explained my situation and asked for either my siders, or possibly for a new hot order as my friends would have all eaten by now and mine would be cold. Her response was, \"I will grab you rice.\" She headed in to the kitchen, grabbed the items I had not received, placed them in my hand and walked away without saying a word. I did not receive any sort of apology for the inconvenience or even a well wish. After arriving home with a half order of rice, I was finally able to eat my cold meal at 8:40ish.   Before taking to Yelp to provide an unsatisfactory review, I wanted to provide management an opportunity to hear my story and to get their feedback on the situation. Unfortunately, their website does not have the ability for me to send an email and retell the events.  I can now say that after visiting Sukho Thai weekly for the past few years, I will now be more than happy to take my business elsewhere to somewhere it may be appreciated and tell my friends to do the same."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often, and every single time the food never disappoints. Always here in the mornings, so the food comes out pretty quick. I always order the Tom Yum soup, and my boyfriend gets the Cashew Chicken. Their fried banana and ice cream dessert is an awesome way to finish the meal."}
{"text":"To start, we didn't get to place an order (group of 2) until maybe 10 minutes in, and this was by another waitress who told us she would take our order even though she wasn't our server.   We got the crispy spring rolls, pad thai, and pad kee maw.  The spring rolls came out 20 minutes later, the main dishes came out more than an hour after we ordered.The entire time, the girl who first took our order (who wasn't actually our server) was serving us the entire time. When we were done and wanted 2 containers to go, we asked that same girl for the containers and the bill. She proceeded to say no problem, I will get you the containers but can't get your bill because I'm not your server. So we had to eventually flag down our \"server\" even though we had no idea who it was because they hadn't served us for the entire meal.   This place is extremely understaffed, seems like both front of house and in the kitchen.  I am very grateful for the other girl who kept serving us and just extremely disappointed at this restaurant's management because the food was actually pretty good. However, I would not come again due to the service."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have ever eaten, period.  Get the Pad Kee Mao, and be prepared to fall in love.  Everything on the menu is fresh, and so flavorful, and oh god, now I'm really hungry.  Just go.  The food is out of this world."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed with this place. The food is okay. The khao soi is much better at khao San road. The flavours weren't as strong / bold. The spring rolls were like any spring roll you'd get at a westernized place and definitely nothing special.   The servers are a bit short with you and don't really listen. They walk away before you even finish your sentence.   There was no wait on a Wednesday night so we got seated right away. The place is pretty nice and clean."}
{"text":"The food here is really tasty but the prices are really high considering what you're getting. It's not the most gourmet of ingredients or the classiest setting. I know they do it well, but by all accounts, the menu items are Thai street food...yet the bill always shocks me a little every time. The service was always a little lackluster and I always chalked it up to their busyness. Well, the last time I was there they weren't as busy and I got the same curt attitude and sour faces from the ladies so it may really be my last time going ever."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is delicious. The Khao Soi is my favourite, but I also love their lemongrass coconut soup. I haven't had anything from there I didn't like.  However, there's not too much seating, and it can be a bummer because there's not much else to do around there if you want to wait for seating.  Delivery also takes a LONG time. They give you a long estimate to begin with, and then usually it's a little late. If you're going to get take-out, you should get pick-up."}
{"text":"I read so many good reviews about it, but when I went there I really didn't like the main course forgot the name noodles and shrimps. They only gave four shrimps in a 14 dollars meal ??? Even in a large soup there were 4 shrimps. Food is just average nothing wow ! One time visit place nothing else"}
{"text":"Khao Soi with chicken with Thai level spiceness...waited 35 minutes for this delicious meal. Not sure why this restaurant has only a few servers working.   The meal was huge and packed with chunky chicken and lots of flavour. The crisp noodles were my favourite to eat with....fun to play with your food. The curry reminds me of Guyanese curry mixed with coconut milk."}
{"text":"I agree with the reviews that the service is painful. The food is fantastic. But I sat waiting for about 30 minutes before the wait staff noticed me and they only have 6 tables. I had to wave three times! It is great when the owner is your host but the rest of the staff are painful."}
{"text":"My friend and I went on a Friday for dinner. Both of our meals were not great. I had pad Thai and the flavour wasn't great and the noodles were actually oily. It was not what I was expecting. My friend had curry and it was kind of dry.   We had desert as well and the fried banana had an artificial tasting over sweet sauce. I don't remember what my friend had but it wasn't great either.   The only thing I liked about this place was the openness of the space. Kind of rare in Toronto to have so much space between tables.   I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night and I was fairly disappointed. The menu was similar to what was at Pai or Khao San Road, so I was expecting it to be comparable.  The mango juice tasted just like the kind you'd find in 7-Eleven, only in a plastic cup with a generous amount of ice in it. Spring rolls didn't seem like they were freshly made either, they didn't come with any dipping sauce and I'm suspicious that they were the kind you'd get from the frozen food section of the grocery store.  The noodle soup was OK I guess. I wanted to ask for chopsticks, but the server didn't really pay attention so I gave up trying to flag them down. It also took a while to ask for the bill.  Not going back."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst pad thai I have ever had. It was dry and tasteless.  I was starving as well so my tastebuds would have been most forgiving at this point.  I would never order from them again it was that terrible.  I can't say anything for the service as we went through Uber eats."}
{"text":"Decent thai food and rich flavours. Menu is rather small, and so is the restaurant. It's not the best Thai i've had in Toronto, but it's cheap and cheerful for sure."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is average. I was so excited to have a Thai place in the neighborhood but this one was a disappointment. The food was mediocre at best. The service was decent but not extraordinary. The dishes out server recommended based on our preferences were nothing special. The quantity was good as we had left overs....but we may have had leftovers because we didn't love the food."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai is a fairly faithful recreation of the sort of place backpackers frequent in Thailand. This sort of food is everywhere in Thailand and isn't that hard to make but for some reason it's impossible to find in Toronto.  Sukho Thai is now tied with Khmer Thai (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/khmer-thai-restaurant-toronto-2) as my top Thai restaurant.  The menu is thankfully small and very well designed with lots of photos. They dispensed with all the crappy dishes no one wants anyway and stuck with the backpacker favourites.  I went straight to the curry section of the menu and was pleased to find five great options: red, green, yellow, Panang, and Masaman. Each can be made with either chicken, beef, or tofu and varying spice levels and they're all $7.50. Best part is the price includes rice; it baffles me that this isn't the case at most Thai places.  On this visit I tried the Masaman Curry and Red Curry, both with tofu. The Red Curry was the better of the two mainly because it came with more vegetables including peppers and squash. The Masaman Curry was also excellent but it was mainly tofu with a few pieces of potato. In both cases the curries would have benefited from a higher ratio of vegetables to tofu. Also, I'd like to see the spice level kicked up a notch; I asked for \"spicy\" but didn't taste any heat whatsoever.  Don't bother with the Spring Rolls ($3.50 for 3), they're nothing special.  The service is a little slow but it's all part of the experience.  Sukho Thai ain't perfect but it's about as close as you're going to get in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends on a Friday. Thankfully we made reservations so we didn't have to wait (otherwise it would have been 30+ mins during dinner time). Despite the restaurant being very busy we were served quite quickly and our server was very helpful. I ordered the chicken pad kee Mao which was delicious with big chunks of chicken. My partner who is vegetarian ordered the gaeng panag which she enjoyed as well but wished it was more spicy (she had to ask for more hot sauce). For desert we split an order of cassava cake which is a bit small for sharing but was a nice way to end the meal. Overall I would come back, it was a nice environment and the food was great."}
{"text":"Ambience is alright, a little bit louder than usual. Price is reasonable. Food was\"meh\", and lacks the vibrant colour you see from Southeast Asia food. When there's a line up at the door on Saturday night, they will print out the receipt soon after one person in the group finishes the meal to drop you a hint that you should vacate the table soon. Men's urinal in the washroom was broken and the faucet lacks warm water. Not good from public health's perspective"}
{"text":"I got the Khao Soi $14 - this is one of the more interesting plated dishes due to the crispy noodles on top of the yellow curry. You can customize your level of spiciness which is great.   The prices here would be considered on the lower side in downtown Toronto for a nice and casual restaurant.   But overall I just thought the food was okay, nothing too special to attract me into coming back again."}
{"text":"If you like Thai cuisine, you must check this place out.  The location is a short walk from the financial district. A group of colleagues and I went during the lunch rush. We were promptly seated. A gentleman stopped by to give us a few minutes to place our orders.  The menu is small but it is filled with items that are traditionally Thai - Guay Tiaw, Nua Gra Teaum.  I went with a delicious red curry (Gaeng Phed) with shrimp. Extra spicy, of course.  The dish was flavourful with the right amount of coconut milk, bay leaves, squash and plump shrimp. It comes with a side of white rice.  All tastefully presented and displayed.  The ambiance is quite nice and cozy.  Definitely a great spot for lunch. I hear the pad thai is awesome. I will be sure to check it out during my next visit."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious!! I ordered the beef pad Thai (spicy) and hubby ordered beef khao soi (medium spice). Both dishes were amazing! Neighbourhood is a little sketchy and the restaurant wasn't very busy when we first got there...but it started to fill up as we began to eat; around 6pm on a Friday evening. Definitely going back to eat again and may even try the other locations."}
{"text":"No split bills for groups of 6 or more. Um..that's when you need the split bills!! 17% gratuity added, which is totally fine. But the no split bills is insane. For a group of 6 or more this just adds 20min of calculation time.  We were grabbing dinner between shows and some members of our party needed to leave earlier than others, so we ended up going to an Indian place near by that does do split bills (even can split shared dishes in half). So lovely and hassle free.  This no split bill thing only happens in Toronto restaurants and I don't understand why??"}
{"text":"Had pad thai wasnt a fan, had way to much peanut sauce in it, if you're a fan of that you may like it. Have had better pad thai at other places"}
{"text":"I've read a lot of reviews about the service at Sukho Thai not being the best until I experienced a small situation recently. I placed an order for pick up on a Friday night which was said to be ready in 40 minutes. I only placed the order for pick up because I figured it would be extremely busy and the wait time for a table would be long. I got to Sukho Thai about 5 minutes after I placed the order to inquire on the wait time for a table and luckily, there was no one before or after me waiting to be seated. I saw some tables for two empty which would have been perfect for me. I asked the hostess if it were possible to just dine in instead of take out. Instead of hiding behind the truth, I told them that I had an order for pick up and they immediately refused to seat me without any hesitation. I could've easily cancelled the pick up order as it was going to take another 40 minutes to be ready...  Instead I waited for my order and left. I wasn't pleased with being rejected to dine in. I don't think any customer coming in to your establishment should be blown away and told that they're not allowed to seat us because we placed an order for pick up. It ruins the experience for the customers and simply leaves a bad image for the restaurant. At the end of the day, I love Sukho Thai. I love their food, drinks and dessert - but their service is something that can definitely be worked on and ensure that customers aren't denied to dine in rather than take out.  Food Reccomendations:  Spicy - Thai Fried Rice with Chicken (The hot sauce served with this dish is amazing and really adds a kick to the rice)   Shrimp Tom Kha  Chicken/Beef Khao Soi  Tapioca Dessert is phenomenal as well"}
{"text":"I don't get the fuss about Sukho Thai.  I think Mengrai Thai is definitely much better,  It's a pretty small, drab space in a pretty sketch part of town. Their website is much more attractive than their physical space.  We went for a late-ish lunch, and the restaurant was pretty empty. The waitress wasn't too happy to see us, I guess we were cutting into her lunch time.  We started off with the garlic chicken, which was pretty dry and didn't feel garlicky enough. We weren't able to get through that one plate.   We split the Khao Sol (with chicken) and it was smooth but very thick, felt pretty heavy on the stomach. Just too heavy; I've come to realize I am not a big fan of thick sauces. Making the yellow curry spicy felt very weird; the hot factor felt very out of place in the  curry base.   There's nothing wrong with the food, it's just not as stellar as people make it out to be."}
{"text":"So, it's been a little while, but this much I remember.  The menu is a bit sparse. The Pad Thai was really good. Actually this place would get 4 stars except that their \"fancy fried rice\" which was just about awful. Whatever you do, don't subject your stomach to this unfancy fair of rice!"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero, I would! Although the food is the same as other locations, this location has horrendous service. I came here to get a take out order and got the dish. I called back and they insisted that I was given the right order. I told them that it was the wrong order and the least they could do was apologize. This location delivers but they said that they would give me the right dish if I brought it back?!!! Definitely not going back! This location ruined it for their chain. I'm not surprised it only has 2.5 stars on yelp."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times since I really like khao San road and the original sukhothai on parliament. The menu is almost the same and also very good. I like the curries the best. The green and red are the best!   The garlic tofu and garlic chicken are also good choices for appetizers and you can never go wrong with appetizers. Fried to perfection!   Haven't had the chance to try their Thai milk tea yet but the lemongrass tea is a very option for those who want that instead of the regular pop since the choices for drinks are not that large.   The best thing about this place is that they take reservations so you can avoid the long line ups at khao San road."}
{"text":"Updating the last review because they seem to be less busy these days, and last time we called we were actually able to get through, and got our food within about 40 minutes. It was fine, but I still don't get all the rave reviews... it's decent Thai food, nothing more nothing less. We ordered a curry, pad thai, the crispy garlic chicken and a Sukho Thai salad. Everything was fine, except the salad. On their online menu it says this has \"mango, carrots, peanuts and coriander\", but all I got was a small styrofoam container with...mango. In some dressing. That was pretty much it. Tasty enough, but would have been hella more tasty with all the other stuff I was promised!  Anyway, not bad, but still very far from being as stellar as other reviewers seem to think. Hopefully they are less busy now that Khao San Road has opened and is drawing all the Thai food obsessives away."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Have waited a long time for food. Had to intercept a server several times to order and get the bill.   Food was randomly taken away before I was done while not looking with clearly more than 1/2 left, and they told me it was my fault for not asking for it to stay or be wrapped up.  Food however was great and is the selling point for this place."}
{"text":"My previous review was for the parliament location. This one for their Wellington. BIG disappointment. The Penang curry was soupy rather than thicker in past. Penang should be thicker than an average red curry and frankly, i couldn't tell the difference between the Penang and the Gaeng Phed when I did a comparison of the sauces. And after loving the sukho pad thai in the past, this was so disappointing. Soggy and too sweet. Reminded me of Spring Rolls. The beef in the Lap salad tasted stale too. The service was average and the music too loud (by too loud, anything at that decibel before 9 pm while trying to enjoy a meal and conversation is too loud). I really hope the owners get this place straightened out because the Parliament location was such a gem."}
{"text":"Not bad. I ordered pad thai. Its good but swollen up.   Except that everything is okay."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Thai food in Toronto - and for the price...a total steal! Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water! I like a little spice - but not too hot and my husband is a huge spice freak and they manage to keep us both happy!   Nothing fancy here - but great service, fantastic food and personally I like the noisy boisterous energy of the place! (It's noisy & busy! If that's not your deal get take-out or something because otherwise you are missing out on some amazing food!)   My favourite is the masaman curry with beef (medium), my husband's is the green curry with chicken (spicy) but we have ordered all of the curries and they are all sooo flavourful and different and it's just...so refreshing! The Sukho Thai Pad Thai is also to *die* for - seriously. This place has ruined pad thai for me everywhere else. It's savoury with a little hint of sweetness and this amazing depth of flavour. Just...total mouthgasm!  They do *some* reservations depending on the hour/day (call and check) - but it's limited so make plans early otherwise expect to wait! OR you can order take-out. The turnaround time for takeout orders is generally around 45 minutes but on busy nights that can sometimes turn into an hour or and hour and 15 minutes. The food is worth the wait but just something to be aware of - order in advance!   And honestly, the neighbourhood isn't really that bad -  the whole Regent Park area is going through this gentrification and there is a playground across the street and lots of people walking around (lots of cabbies too lol!) - don't let it's location scare you off!"}
{"text":"I love my thai food, and will definately be back.   The spring rolls were nice and crispy, the mango salad was wonderful, the chicken satay skewers were also great.   The Tom Kha Gai was a dream, the cashew chicken was tasty but the lack of viewable cashews left me wanting. Don't get me wrong through it was delicious.   The Pad Thai was top notch, the Kha Soi was great - I'd recommend away from the mild route.   All in all this was great and I'll be back"}
{"text":"The food itself is no doubt worthy of a full five stars. The Sukho Thai pad thai (distinguishing itself from the regular option with extra herbs and peanuts for a little more than an extra dollar) was amazingly fragrant and full of delicious vegetables and cubes of fried tofu. The gaeng panang with basil which was at first sight a shock of oiliness, proved to be just as tasty as my favourite competitor's saucier version and a perfect complement to the sticks of smooth creamy tofu it covered. My first Thai iced tea was indeed sweet and creamy as our server had described it and provided a nice balance to the hot and spicy flavours of the dinner.  Besides my complaints, (i.e. it took a long time plus a reminder for our water to arrive, the oscillating fan blasting in my face was irritating, the cheap single-use chopsticks kept breaking into smaller parts, the table wasn't cleared for ages, and the bill took forever), they made a big mistake in delivering us a super spicy chicken pad thai with peanuts when we had been careful to emphasize our vegetarian preference and my dinner date's peanut allergy. Despite our attempts at getting someone's attention, it wasn't until I went up to the counter later that they realized the mix-up. They were sincerely apologetic and quick to replace the dish with the correct (and incredibly delicious) one, so since everyone was okay, we quickly brushed off the potential incident.  There is little more inspiring than the view of such a warm, open kitchen crammed full of happy cooks and mounds of freshly prepped ingredients to a foodie. I look forward to trying as many dishes off of the concise menu that Sukho Thai has to offer, although I would probably be wise to do so by calling ahead of time for take out."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai is a great place to go for Thai food; however, it is quite expensive for what you get. I have only had the green curry, the khao soi and the thai iced tea.   Green Curry (5 Stars) - If you are having a difficult time deciding, this is the choice to go! One of the best curries in Toronto! Very flavorful and absolutely delicious!  Khao Soi (3 Stars) - Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. I was expecting the meat to be moist and tender, but it was dry and chewy. To be honest, I felt quite disgusted after. It was like drinking thick curry gravy, which was overwhelming and heavy. Will not be getting this ever again.   Thai Iced Tea (4 Stars) - Really refreshing and delicious. If you never had Thai Iced Tea before, be sure to order one for the experience! I enjoyed it but nothing out of the ordinary.   Recommended to anyone that is craving curry in Toronto!"}
{"text":"How did I miss doing a review for a place I go to or get take out food from at least once a month?  The food is delicious, and because of this they are always crazy busy, especially for dinner and extra especially on weekends.  The one thing we noticed on our last visit is that they actually answered the phone so we could place a take out order... In the past they would be too busy to answer the phone.  And the food was ready in 30 minutes when in the past it would take more than an hour.  Was it a fluke?  Time will tell.  I love the garlic chicken - they are like chicken nuggets for grown ups with tons of garlic flavour, breaded in panko and fried.  You can not go wrong with the Sukho Thai version of Pad Thai - but if you are like me and don't like cilantro, ask them to leave it out.  Hubby loves the Pad Kee Mao - rice noodles sautéed with lots of Thai basil, veggies and your choice of protein - shrimp is perfect in this dish but if you don't like the licorice flavour of Thai Basil, skip it.  Another of his faves is the Khao Soi Beef, tender chunks of slow braised beef in a rich sauce that has a great depth of flavour - but one of those flavours is cilantro so I let him have it all.  The red curry is our fave, but he likes it Thai Spicy (which is only for serious spice lovers) and I like it medium, so we get 2 orders.  It has a lovely coconut milk base and pieces of squash that absorb the tasty curry sauce.  The tapioca dessert is a great way to cool down the palate after the meal - not too sweet and with strips of young coconut in coconut milk, the tapioca soaks up the milk perfectly.  Whether eating in or taking out, be prepared to decide how spicy you want almost every dish, including the Pad Thai... But be warned, Thai Spicy burns going down and the next day with ring of fire!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. Order here all the time and it is always perfect, my order is always flawless (important since I have a nut allergy and Thai food has lots of cashews), the food always tastes fantastic and fresh. It's definitely my favourite Thai restaurant. Even the plain white rice is tasty!  Their cold rolls are so good - NOT full of iceberg lettuce like most places. They're always fresh and full of deliciousness like mango, basil, veggies.  Fried spring rolls are soo tasty as well but it's hard to get them too wrong... they do it so right though.  Pad Thai is done right with delicious sauce and the noodles are not overcooked but have a nice amount of chewiness that I'm addicted to.  Red and green curry are amazing... so tasty, creamy, with fresh veg/meat. They have squash in it too and it's amazing!   I've also tried their coconut chicken soup and it's really good - perfect balance of flavors.   I literally have nothing bad to say. Just be sure to call 30 mins ahead for pickup. It sucks they're closed on Sunday! Also the restaurant is pretty small and always looks busy when I pick up my food so you may find it hard to get a seat."}
{"text":"I tried Sukho with an open mind as I (for once!) did not look at reviews before going!   We ordered the pad Thai, panang curry shrimp, the khao soi, and fresh rolls, and everything was SO delicious and flavourful. Like seriously, yum.   Now this review comes with a warning. Everything we ordered was medium spicy, and my spice tolerance is not great, but I figured I've been working on it, so medium will be fine right??? NO. It was so spicy, heart burn out of control! The one thing is it was so delicious I ate it anyway. Next time, MILD.   You've been warned."}
{"text":"A must on anybody's Toronto best eats bucket list. Can't speak for any other location to get Sukho Thai but this little restaurant tucked at Parliament and Dundas had all the charm and cozy for me to want to go back stat. Small and just shy of hip, has you focussing on the food rather than the decor. Serves mean Thai cuisine, right up there with Pai and Khao San Road.  Chicken pad thai ($15.50) - amazingly delicious. Recommended dish for everyone, way different from the mall foodcourt dish you're used to. Sweet, savory, flavorful. Complicated combination of ingredients but all you can taste or think of is perfectly cooked noodles... enough for you to dismiss the cost. 5/5  Beed khao soi ($15.50) - also amazing. Soup was heavy with amazing flavour. Taste notes and textures diverse. Had me going in for the next bite before I finished the one I was working on. 4.5/5  Thai iced tea ($4.50) - served in a large mason cup, dense, orange tea topped with a thick layer of condensed milk. Drink slowly to allow the ice to melt some into the drink. A must! 4/5  Very happy with this dinner decision! Service was quick and accurate. Overall rating 4.5/5"}
{"text":"A coworker and I decided to swing by for a quick lunch on a Thursday as something different than our Brookfield Place food court.   We mentioned when we arrived that we would like to order and eat quickly as we had to get back to the office. This request was definitely noticed and our service was expedient.   We decided to share the fresh vegetable spring rolls and chicken pad Thai. The spring rolls were crunchy, refreshing and delicious with a perfectly paired peanut sauce. Consistent with other Thai restaurants and did not disappoint. The pad Thai was lacking in the vegetable department - very noodle heavy. I would have appreciated more sprouts or something to lighten it up a bit. The flavour however, was spot on.   I will definitely be back for another go round - next stop the soup and mango salad. Other true staples of Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been to Sukho a few times now.  The sukho mojito is amazing!!  It's a spicy, gingery version of the classic mojito.  The fresh rolls are a fantastic appetizer but my favorite dish remains the Khao Soi.  Packed with flavour - this is the dish I always order.  The service is always friendly, not always quick but always friendly.  Visit Khao Soi on Wellington!!"}
{"text":"This appears to be the next fave next to Khao San Road, which might I mention the line up is ridic. The ambience of Sukho Thai isn't as 'trendy' as Khao San, but there is more seating that I expected (they have basement seating) and service is pretty efficient. The waiting area Parliament location) though is a bit tight since the entrance is small. Good luck waiting outside in the winter.  All the basic Thai dishes were flavourful and authentic; definitely a lot of spices in the cooking process. The curries are deelish - I had the green. Pad thai was normal but the colour seemed like they used a bit of ketchup... hope not. Perhaps one of my fave Thai dishes is the Tom Yum soup, which was pretty good here with all the flavours you would expect. Only down side is the size which is definitely not enough to share. The mango sticky rice can do better, but not to say it was terrible. Mango sticky rice is a must have at the end of a Thai dinner!  The dishes were not expensive, but definitely not cheap. The place is cozy which is very different than its rival. Depends on your taste but this is definitely one of the spots to visit downtown when it comes to Thai food."}
{"text":"Super fun and busy atmosphere. The yellow curry is to die for but the staff can be a bit cold at times."}
{"text":"Given the recent shake-up of events at KSR, my Yelp bud Abbas & I decided to finally make a date at Sukho Thai's to taste and experience what all the fuss was about.  The interior of Sukho's is pleasantly modern, with dark woods exposed brick and has MUCH more room to move than Khao San.  Service was fairly quick and friendly, as it should be given it wasn't the mad house that KSR can be.  Menu wise it is fairly close to KSR , but sadly Sukho does not offer the squash fritters   :(   On the plus side, you can actually make a reservation at Sukho's and not have to wait an hour to mope around the entertainment district to be seated...that's  certainly something of a leg-up on KSR.  I ordered Lemongrass iced tea, like Abbas states is pretty underwhelming if not a tad too sweet, pretty much like glucose pimped out water, but the real shocker for me was that it was that Abbas ordered a virgin drink???  The Khao soi chicken was good, and the curry itself was so creamy rich and filling.  My problem is, I had to spoon out a huge dollop of chili paste/flakes beforehand as I had specifically asked for MILD, NOT SPICY!!!  I was not impressed, but remained quiet about it like the nice Asian I can (sometimes) be.    Okay, here comes the bitching...How is it that I went to Khao San two weeks earlier and was able to order THE SAME THING in an environment where the music is cranked at concert like decibels, where it is packed to the gills and the staff is worked into a near frenzy/riot from the skirmishes happening near the endlessly crowded doorway from the anxious folks all lined up, acting all cracked-out waiting to get in and yet my order came EXACTLY PERFECTLY MILD like I asked, yet at the serene calm quiet and seemingly controlled environment of Sukho Thai, not a single fuck was given toward my request for mild?  We finished off with a duo of desserts which was the Tapioca with coconut milk and the incredible cassava cake!  The tapioca dessert was alright, but the cassava cake was the clear winner as it reminded me of a much more decadent and creamy flavoured version of mochi with coconut flakes...okay so a small victory for Sukho's.  In conclusion, I have to agree with a good portion of previous Yelpers and say while the food is on par if not rather excellent in quality, the service at Sukho Thai NEEDS to be FINE TUNED.  Yes we all have PMS days and yes sometimes customers can be picky as hell, but if you wanna be bigtime and roll with the likes of Khao San, a very simple request for not spicy should not be overlooked."}
{"text":"I walked in on the second night and the place was EMPTY. It worked out for us because the server was super fast and friendly.   I got the Guaytiaw - it was similar to most Pho but on the sweeter side. The Shrimp chips were nothing special. Going back for the Tom Kha Gai though, that stuff is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I'm eating chicken pad thai as I'm writing and I have to say...its a little bland. The food is way over priced for what i'm getting. The amount is a good portion of food but it still isn't worth $15. I'm sure other items on the menu are good but haven't got around to trying them yet. I want to like this place, I do, however the bang for your buck is just not there. $15 for chicken pad thai is outrageous. The food cost on this dish is $4.00 max. The noodles are overcooked and the effort just wasn't put into this particular night's dish. If they dropped their prices 10-20% I would become a weekly customer."}
{"text":"I came to Sukho Thai for a late lunch and after craving Thai food for several days, it did not disappoint! My boyfriend and I shared Tom Kha Gai soup (chicken in lemon grass/coconut milk broth)-- it was his first time having it ever and he fell in love! It was a very fair sized portion- the chicken was generous and the vegetables were fresh.   I got the Khao Soi which was equally amazing. It comes topped with crispy noodles and is definitely Instagram worthy. My boyfriend got the yellow curry. We definitely enjoyed the Khao Soi more and thought that the portion size for the curry was a bit small for the price (15 for a bowl of curry and side of rice), but enjoyed it otherwise. Our server was kind but because we came in around 1:30 PM, the restaurant was about to close and we were rushed. She also gave us a bit of an attitude when we inquired about spice level.. although I can't say I blame her because it is difficult to quantify spice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good thai food I would highly recommend Sukho Thai. Their dish 'Khao Soi' is amazing and flavourful with a strong thai curry and spice flavour. The consistency is good, and the beef was cooked just right (soft and tender) and falls apart right when you bite into it! If you can, take the sauce home and you can use it for many other things. I also recommend the Thai iced tea. Not too creamy and not too sweet. A little bit on the icey side but overall great!   The service was good, just a little bit slow when it's a full house (but that's normal compared to any other resto). Overall great experience and accommodated a group of 9 last minute. So kudos to them!   TIP: if you're not a spice fanatic get mild. Thai spice is a little bit more spicy than you would expect! But if you like spice, go medium-spicy and you're in for plenty of flavour!"}
{"text":"the love affair is back on... the past two times I've ordered, my delivery window has shrunk down to a reasonable hour, and both times they've been before the 60 minute mark - they are on to something good!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious lunch here! We shared four dishes (beef khao soi, cashew chicken, fried rice, and pad thai) and each one was cooked perfectly. The place itself is nicely decorated and the service was excellent. I will have to come back and have their $9 lunch special as that seems like a great deal!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with friends.  The place has a good ambience although our waiter was clueless when it came to thai food.  The pad kee mao we ordered came with pad thai noodles instead of the expected/desired flat broad noodle.  You could tell they just make a bunch of pad thai noodles and for the pad kee mao mix in bell peppers and tack on an extra buck to the price.  Beers were also fairly overpriced at appx $7 each.    Vegetable fresh rolls were excellent and full of assorted veggies.  Hot sauce provided on the side had an excellent kick and mixed in well with the meal.  Would likely avoid next time and hit up a more traditional thai place that focuses on food over image."}
{"text":"Excellent food and take away. Their delivery sucks though. Must order at least 90 mins before you want to eat. Not really conducive to a last minute meal when hungry. When I explain this to person who answers phone they could care less. Kind of takes away from the kind Thai image they want to project. If they force you to come pick up the food since delivery is virtually non existent then there should be a discount.  Takes away from customers experience. Very disorganised at pickup.no name on order to verify what you have etc. Too bad because the food is great"}
{"text":"My go-to spot when I'm craving Thai food, and one of my favourite restaurant in the city.  Food: Delicious food with a good portion size. By the end of the meal I'm usually in a food coma. Their curry's are pretty good (especially the green one), but their best dish is definetly their Khao Soi with beef. Large chunks of beef in a rich yellow curry that you just want to drink up.   Service: The staff is friendly. It can get quite busy sometimes so service can slow down a little.  Atmosphere: Busy place with a mix of business people and casual guests. It can get quite loud sometimes."}
{"text":"I loooooooveee this place! I did not realize what I was missing by eating any other Thai food. I could never understand why basil cashew chicken never did it for me and now I know why. Their beautiful, deep and complex curry's warm my stomach and bring a huge smile to my face. My favorite is the red squash curry. I love that I get to chose how spicy I'm feeling that day as well. Big thumbs up to Sukhothai"}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Thai food I've ever had. Everyone I know of who have tried it love it, and always want to go back. I always get one of their curry dishes and my friend always gets the pad thai. We love it every time.  The price is amazing for the food you get. There's always a long line of people waiting for take out."}
{"text":"Shrinking portion sizes and low quality..... That's my most recent experience with their delivery. Wait of 90 mins plus late for 40 mins (I live in regent Park) = over 2 hours... Cold food. Small portions. Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Used to be my favourite Thai place but the quality has gotten pretty bad. Also the takeout portions have gotten so small. The pad Thai and pad see ew is always soggy. We added  chicken but had literally two pieces in it. Also ordered gaeng panag and didn't come with rice like it used to. At least tell me so I can order the rice now. The garlic nuggets are still good though but It's time to move on unfortunately."}
{"text":"I love Sukho thai! It's also my mothers favourite! We go there- Must have Gaeng masaman and garlic shrimp!"}
{"text":"If you are used to Pai or Khao San Road's quality of Thai food.. I wouldn't recommend this place.  Khao Soi:  - the sauce was watery - noodles were overcooked and soggy - barely any meat in there  Crispy Shrimp Roll: A-ok  Food: 2.5/5 Service: 2/5 Ambiance: 3/5"}
{"text":"A very loud bar atmosphere. The food was decent but it took a while and the service is slow but then again, this place is super busy."}
{"text":"I usually get take out. I KNOW it will be a 45 minute wait from the time I place an order, and I never complain, because the food is always wonderful, rich, and fresh. I have to get two orders of garlic chicken appetizer or my kids threaten a coup d'état. Not a fan of the spring rolls, but that is just me, everyone else I know that has had them raves. Green curry beef, yellow curry chicken, suk'd up pad Thai chicken, feeds us for a couple of meals. When no one is looking, I make a container for lunch and sneak it into the freezer."}
{"text":"Other than the amazing authentic Tom yum shrimp soup I've had in Thailand... Here is almost just as tasteful and yummy hehe. Love the thai tea too!!   Pad Thai is so much better than many other places  And the pad sew"}
{"text":"The Chicken Pad Thai was Verrrry good. I ordered thai spicy and it had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The peanut oil complimented the dish very well and each bite was delicious. I also had the opportunity to try the khao soi which was an absolutely delightful coconut gravy with cardamom. The food was 10/10 but the service was very slow and the host didn't pay very much attention to us. The service was below average so despite the food being amazing, I'm giving this restaurant 3/5."}
{"text":"second time i go there. first was quite promising but not second!!  could be much better ranked for me whether they paid more attention to the customers eating there rather than to the ones taking food out. I had to wait hours to be served and even to pay so I can eventually leave from the place!  otherwise food is quite good but quite expensive also, especially for such a bad organization.  close the restaurant and make it a take-out-only or make some effort!!"}
{"text":"Amazing thai food. The green curry was amazing and they also know how to make Tom yam! It was pleasant and satisfying. Servers were very active and professional. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the city in my opinion. Although I havent explored their menu beyond the pad thai's and shrimp rolls - So I can only give my opinion on those dishes. The option for spice level is pretty accurate. I've dined in and also ordered take out from this location on numerous occasions and the food is consistently good. I'm looking forward to trying other dishes... but Im currently sticking to what I know wont disappoint. I dont care too much for the service, or the miserable looking person at the take out counter. But 5 star for the food!"}
{"text":"I came to Sukho Thai for lunch.  Sukho Thai is located near Pravda and Reservoir Lounge.  This will be my third visit but first time writing the review for this restaurant.  Lunch hours are quite busy so make sure you make reservations. It was packed and a long like up when we got there.  Good thing I made reservations.  We got seated right away.  I wanted to try the coconut water or mango juice but was told it's not fresh and out of a can so I forgo that and stuck with water.  First couple times I pretty much had the same experience. Very consistent.  Service was good.  It was pretty busy so I would say whatever we ask for came pretty fast. We ordered the chicken nuggets as an appetizer it was pretty good. For our mains I got the pad Thai with chicken and my friend got the Thai fried rice.  The pad Thai was good and portion was huge.  I kept eating and it felt like there was a never ending pile.  My friend has the Thai chicken friend rice. It was a little soggy for me but it was flavourful because you're suppose to pour fish sauce over the top of the rice. The side fresh chillies fish sauce was amazing.  All in all good food. I would come back again."}
{"text":"6/25/15: I believe this was overall one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eaten at.  Not only was the food good, the atmosphere was clean, crisp, and modern, just like the plating of the dishes.  Hole-in-the-walls are great, but sometimes you just wanna give your eyes something..... new.  Love the fresh feel here, from the decor to the food.  Unfortunately we ate here more than a month ago, and typically I'd have detailed notes and scores for all the dishes, but I can't remember much anymore except that everything was awesome...  1. Mango Juice C$6.00:  Can't remember much except it was delicious.  The small jug is about enough for 2 people.  2. Mango Salad C$6.00:  This is the one item I do remember very well!!!, which means it was totally badass.  I've had various salads from Thai places and while okay, they were, well, salady.  This one has tons of perfectly ripened mango, not just the green type.  Very sweet and savory at the same time.  LOVE this salad.  I would say it's a must get.  10/10  3. Pad Thai with Shrimp C$13.00:  Sorry, no memory.  4. Nua Gra Teaum (Garlic Beef) C$13.00:  On this one, I remember that the beef was pretty overcooked and dry.  I think this was the one disappointment here.  Lots of awesome stuff here--try something else instead.  5/10  Trust me, you'll love this place if you like Thai food!  5/5  #canada #thai"}
{"text":"The food was good but the wait time was ridiculous; we waited 20 minutes for our (one) appetizer and another 40 minutes for our two mains (a curry dish and fried rice).   I've definitely been serviced a lot faster at the other Sukho Thai locations, so I'm going to stick to those and choose not to return here again.  The staff were nice tho.  Highlight of the evening was hearing the 2 seater table beside us complain about their wait time for food, I felt like we were in it together."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very tasty food at a very reasonable price. We are becoming regulars. Highly recommend the panang curry with fish, and the Pad Kee Mao. Delish!"}
{"text":"Good food, ample portions, good service, reasonable price especially for downtown and the only option that worked for my Halal fellow diner. I might go back."}
{"text":"Sigh sigh sigh. I thought I'd give Sukho Thai another chance since the new location is convenient for me. I wasn't a big fan of the original one to start with.  Waited for 45 minutes on a week night at 6:30pm. Surprisingly for this area, the restaurant had more college students than office folks. Anyhow. After being seated, we got water after a LONG time. Then someone came to take our order after a LONG time. After an even LONGER wait, they put someone else's food on our table. Finally, all confusion being cleared, we got our food. The medium spicy was a good level - not very spicy but good enough.  But the food continues to be heavy, creamy and greasy. Halfway through my khao soi, my stomach started churning. By the time I dragged myself home, I was feeling miserable, and couldn't stand the rest of the evening, feeling sick and miserable. EVERY time I visit Sukho Thai. So its not me, its Sukho Thai.  I wish they'd use lighter and fresher ingredients. I'd be able to enjoy this flavour. I know I'm NEVER risking this again. Sticking to my usual thai favourites."}
{"text":"I'm still confused by what people like in this place. Service is so fantastic, that once we waited an hour for food before getting up from our table and asking for a server. Guess what we were told... our server's duty was over for the day so he left without passing on our order. And nobody seemed apologetic or bothered by this. And this sort of absurd waiting time, not being able to grab the server's attention and rude staff has been the standard during my mutiple visits.  Food is rich and greasy and leaves me feeling sick after. Not the fresh spices that make up GOOD Thai food. It's a dingy, greasy kind of hole in the wall that doesn't make the real thing at all. It's one of those that has to load on the grease and spices to mask the unfreshness of it all. Maybe some people like the food and that's great (choices do differ), but I don't think anyone will argue the lack of atmosphere and terrible service along with bad attitude here. Do you REALLY want to keep giving business to a place that thinks it can get away with rudeness and treat you like they're giving you free stuff, when in fact you're paying more than this atmosphere is worth?  I have a code that I follow - bad attitude does not make up for a good product. There are others who treat me better and deserve the business more. Even if I loved this food (which I do not), for this amosphere, service and attitude - no way!"}
{"text":"Normally Sukho Thai is good. The food is decent. However, they're now officially on the blacklist because they screwed up a takeout order beyond belief (I was missing half of my food). When I went back to ask for a refund they took forever to work out precisely the value of the food that was missing. The thing that they don't understand is that when you leave out a significant portion of an order, it messes up THE WHOLE MEAL. The service guy at the pickup desk was terrible at trying to figure this out. He blamed the kitchen and said it wasn't his fault. Note to Sukho Thai management: train your customer facing staff to be polite and solve problems. Your food is good but your service ensures I will not be back."}
{"text":"Khao Soi was the  favourite of the three dishes we tried. The curry gravy was so silky and fragrant. The noodles were chewy and cooked al dente. The beef was very tender albeit it only had a few pieces. As good as it was I still think the Khao Soi at Khao San Road is much better. The red curry and  tom yum soup were above average but not sensational. As a side note, I really didn't like the  rice. The portions were not enough for the curry dishes and it was really dry and crumbly."}
{"text":"Wow! This is the best Thai food I've had in Toronto. I ordered the khao soy (chicken and green curry with egg noodles) and it was heavenly. The line ups can be long on weekdays after work or on the weekend; up to 30-45 min wait for groups of 3-4. They do take out but the wait is a bit less. Small venue but the food is simply phenomenal. Authentic Thai food doesn't get any better the this. The fried fish is also very delectable. Go now if you've never been. Pro-tip: if you go late in the night, almost close to closing, they are quiet so if you want a late night snack, this is the place to go. Pro-tip 2: the neighbourhood is sketchy but just ignore the hobos."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check out the new Sukho Thai location (which just opened on December 3!), as I love Chef Nuit's cooking. Walking in, the latest incarnation of Sukho Thai looks much way bigger and much more modern than the original location, with sleek black walls and a minimalist approach to decor. Definitely an upscale vibe, I felt almost underdressed...  Anyway, we were greeted warmly and led to a table. Red curry is my usually my favourite, but I'm not a huge fan of the large chunks of squash that they include in the red curries at Sukho Thai and Khao San Road, so I opted for the green curry instead. My boyfriend ordered the Khao Soi with beef, and we shared the garlic tofu to start.  Our food came out quickly, and the first thing I noticed was that some of the plates were chipped and there were obvious greasy fingerprints around the edges. My restaurant philosophy is that if Gordon Ramsay wouldn't let it pass in his kitchen, it's not good enough for me! Just kidding...but it was a bit strange for a new restaurant and an unpleasant start to the meal.   I found the garlic tofu a little bit too dark for my liking, with an almost burnt flavour. My green curry came with chunks of squash, which hadn't been specified on the menu -- if I had known that both curries came with squash, I would have just ordered the red! My boyfriend's Khao Soi was lukewarm at best, and when he told our server, it was taken away, microwaved, and brought back with a lacklustre apology. We both agreed that we've had better at Khao San Road.  Also, our server seemed like he was scared of us, as I saw him approach our table and then turn and walk away on several different occasions. He didn't really check in on us to ask how everything was, and we had to ask for the bill after it was obvious he wasn't going to bring it over any time soon. Even after we asked for the bill, our dishes were never cleared away, and our half-eaten food sat in front of us until we got up and left.   Having eaten at Sukho Thai and Khao San Road numerous times before, I'll chalk this experience up to opening kinks, but expected a lot more from this restaurant considering its popularity and success. From all the positive reviews, maybe I should have checked out Sabai Sabai instead!"}
{"text":"Hands down the easiest place to get a reservation out of the popular Thai restaurants (yes you should always reserve ahead of time). But that doesn't mean it's not as good, because this place is owned by the same owners as Pai. It's spacious so you won't feel like your conversations are being overheard by the table next to yours.   You can't go wrong with the pad Thai or khao soi. I've had both several times and they are amazing each time. For those who can take a little bit of spicy, I recommend ordering the pad Thai with a medium level of spice. The tiny kick gives it more layers of flavour compared to the mild.   I've also had the massaman curry, which is a peanut based curry and is one of my favourite curries. It's a sweeter curry, so it's perfect for those who don't take spicy very well. You can't find this everywhere, so be sure to give it a try! It's definitely better than the red and green curry.   And of course, they serve cocktails but you'd be a fool to order those over the Thai Iced Tea. If you really want an alcoholic drink, you can head over to a bar in the area. The Thai Iced Tea is to die for."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant, based on reviews and from what I've heard about this famous Toronto Thai institution. The service and food fell short of all such expectations.  We had the pad thai and a green curry. The curry was average at best, and the pad thai was awful. The noodles were way too thick and undercooked. I understand that rice noodles in pad thai needs to be a little chewy, but this was not just a little chewy. This was unappetizingly chewy. The pad thai sauce was flat in flavour- I tasted the tamarind, but that's basically all I tasted. Not salted enough, not sour or tangy or anything- just sweet tamarind. Also, not a generous serving of vegetables with the pad thai.   The worst part was the service and the noise. We arrived shortly after they opened and it was already packed and LOUD. My friends and I were shouting across the table at one another in order to make conversation. The music was terribly loud and there was a TV, too. This forced patrons to shout in order to communicate.   Our waiter rushed us and made no effort to show the slightest sense of hospitality towards us. I understand it's a busy restaurant and the staff feels rushed, but I don't think I'm wrong in having expected just a bit more pleasantness. When it came to the time of paying our bills, we asked for one bill but then quickly changed our minds to separate ones (note that we were being rushed in this process), which prompted our waiter to very rudely say \"OH? you want separate bills now?!\" He walked away and shot us a terribly cruel look while mouthing the word \"f***\". He thought no one had seen this, but I did. We paid and got out of there as quickly as possible.   There are SEVERAL Thai options in Toronto. Save your money, time, and vocal chords and avoid this place. There's no need to give your business to establishments who treat you as more of a burden than as a customer to welcome and treat. Awful."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about my pad thai and despise when restaurants try to serve me ketchup + noodles instead.   With that said, Sukho Thai makes a pretty good pad thai - perfectly flavoured with bean sprouts and tiny chunks of tofu and protein (chicken for me). I really liked that you could choose the level of spice for your dish - something I'm not used to when it comes to pad thai. I also tried the thai iced tea as everyone suggested and it was good, but I was surprised at how sweet it was because I was expecting something similar to bubble tea."}
{"text":"This isn't your traditional Thai place.  It's traditional with it's a twist.  So if you're looking for the traditional stuff, maybe this isn't your go to place on a Tuesday night.  If you love Thai and are open minded, this is your place to try some great flavours!  The portions are generous and the food is delicious.  And they mean spicy when they say spicy!    They don't serve alcohol, and you will likely have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Loved it. We were seated in probably the most awkward table in the place on a busy, chilly night, the one near the door and next to a line of people waiting, so basically we felt like we had an audience... and there was a tv screen right in the direction I was facing, but someone's waiting head was always blocking me from watching the Cubs game.. however, I'm only saying this because that's the reason for only four stars instead of five. The food was so tasty, I mostly didn't care!  I had the Masaman Curry with tofu, and yumm, the sauce was so tangy and delicious, I keep thinking about it. My cousin had the pad thai and liked it, though it was unusually spicy for pad thai that she requested as mild. For such a busy night, the service was still pretty good. If I lived in the area, this would definitely be my go-to Thai spot!"}
{"text":"I love me some Sukho Thai.  My biggest complaint is that everyone else loves them too! You can never get through when you call and the place is always packed. They have a ton of staff working too in that tiny little place.  My default dish is the green curry. YUMMAY!"}
{"text":"The food quality and prices are great but I had to give it just a 3 star rating because of the consistently slow service and delivery time. It is also extremely loud and you have to practically yell for the person beside you to hear you.   On a positive note though, I have had the Thai iced tea and several of the curry dishes and Pad Thai on separate occasions and they never disappoint. My favourite is the green curry with fish. Their dishes are not as fancy as Khao San Road or Pai but you are getting larger portions at lower price ranges."}
{"text":"Angelica L.  is right.  The fish fillet is amazing!  Even if it's take out.  It was still crispy after 10 mins!"}
{"text":"Quality thai restaurant in west end.  I've been to original location and the food was great so I was excited when as new option was available closer to home.  BUT the menu options are limited and reflect more of a mom and pop shop than a full restaurant (see pictures of menu or online). They didn't have pad see ew (seriously?!?) so we got the other 2 noodle dishes on the menu - pad thai and pad kee Mao and both were great!  Soft, chewy, flavorful noodles and good portions.  They cover the basics in entrees.  2-3 options of noodles, curries or rice dishes. On the plus side, the prices are very reasonable (about $12 for entrees).  And the decor is modern and hip.  Brockton village is west of ossington and there are other hip restaurants but there isn't much else going on in that area... Like another reviewer said, prob not worth the drive if there are other options closer to you. But quality, price, hip and fun vibe (and for me close to home) it's my new go-to place for some Thai classics!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star  There is nothing too \"Thai\" about Sukho Thai aside from the food they offers.   I do like this new location much better than their first one on Parliament. Close to King Subway Station and take reservations! The inside is really roomy but the deco is more modern pub like and not that hole in the wall vibe.  We were lucky to arrived right before the lunch rush. There were a party of over 20 that  came in for lunch gathering and we rushed to put our order through, if not I cannot imagine how long would be the wait for our food!  Larp Gai ($12) Sukho Thai Pad Thai ($14) Beef Massaman ($12)  Thai Spicy was requested but it was a little weak for the spice level. I was digging around my larp gai looking for fresh chili pepper and could not even find any. However, the Massaman though not spicy but the flavour was really balanced and complex.  If you looking authentic Thai food, Sukho Thai is good choice comparing to a lot of other Thai restaurants in the area. I will say go for it!"}
{"text":"If not for Yelp, I would have never ever go to Sukho Thai! I cannot imagine a Thai restaurant located in this neighbour!  We dropped by on a Monday evening and this place is packed!!! We were lucky to have a table right away. We were seated fright in front of the counter, so we did get great service.. since we were right in their face and they cannot ignore us.  Our server is this young owner and he was really polite and friendly. He helped us with the menu selections... my friend ordered the Pad Kee Mao with tofu (not spicy) and I ordered the Gaeng Panang with beef (thai spicy) and Thai spring roll to share.   The spring rolls were nice and steaming hot! fresh from the fryer... and the sauce that comes with it tasted so good.. I have to say those are not something from the bottle....  The Pad Kee Mao with tofu was really tasty too... of course I would rather has the thai spicy version.. My curry was not really thai spicy but is good enough! They put in fresh chili pepper to make it more hot... the beef is nice and tender... and the gravy is just perfect to go with rice... (I wolfed down everything so fast.. and even help myself with my friend noodles!)  Can't imagine how busy this place will be on a Friday or Saturday night!   I will definitely be back again to try out other dishes on the menu! And for sure THAI SPICY!!  They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac!"}
{"text":"The best Thai I've had in Toronto!  I've been to this hole-in-the-wall on Parliament and have ordered delivery from them several times.    All the curries, pad thai, and spring rolls are great and the prices are low.  I usually get the panang curry but I've tried the red and green and they were both stellar too.    Others to Trai: Garlic tofu: Delicious deep-fried firm tofu bites.  If you're doing delivery, try dipping the leftovers in sriracha or dijon, mmmmm.  Pla Taud: This is an offensively moist and tender cut of fish--seriously worth trying.    Living about a 25-minute-walk away, I've had to wait between 45-90 minutes for delivery--but it's well worth it if you're laze.  As for the in-house experience, it's no-nonsense decor and service.  The food is the main event!"}
{"text":"best curry soup base that ive ever had.  highly recommends: khao soi , shrimp chips (the sauce is out of this world!), mango juice"}
{"text":"Weird tasting pad Thai, decent fresh spring rolls. I definitely don't understand why people said this is one of the best Thai places they have been to. Pad Thai tasted like curry which was completely not expected. I wouldn't go to this place again. If you like curry, maybe you may find the tastes interesting but that's it for the most part"}
{"text":"Busy restaurant on a Saturday night. The ambiance and decor is sleek and modern.   The food was fantastic. I started out with the fried spring rolls with plum sauce. I must say they were some of the best I have had in a long time. They had the perfect amount of spice that balanced well with the plum sauce.   For my main, I got spicy Green curry with bamboo and rice. The curry had good flavor but fell a little flat for not being rich enough. The tofu was a bit too soft for my liking.   My friend ordered the Panang curry with beef and really enjoyed it.   They have a four point scale for spice level so you can get mild to very spicy.   Finally my friend ordered a Tamarind lime cocktail which tasted fantastic. It was quite sour though so if you like sweet cocktails then stay away! Also they have Thai beer so definitely give those a try as well.   The service was slow and that's why they lost a star. Will definitely come back to try different dishes."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant yesterday. The interior decor and ambience was pretty neat. The service was very slow and sometimes confusing. The food was alright, nothing crazy, won't be going back."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place on the Thai food alone.  But alas I can not.  I went for lunch today after being there a few times in the last few years.   They have some of the best Thai food in the city and offer combo lunches with an entree, drink and a green mango salad, Yum! I really like their Mussaman Curry lots of crunchy peanuts in this thick creamy curry served with perfectly cooked rice. Their biggest fault is that I had to wait almost 45min for the curry and my lunch companion who ordered the Pad Thai (Which is quite stellar also I might add) had gotten and eaten his entire meal by the time my curry finally arrived.  As well as the 2 other tables that arrived after us had received and almost finished their meals as well.  At least I could have been told what the delay was but I was not.   It pains me to give you a lower rating, but come on get the kitchen sorted out and don't let orders go out until the whole table is prepared. The FOOD IS SO TASTY but the service needs to improve.  I guess the answer is to just order take out next time."}
{"text":"Hands down, best delivery Thai food in the city. Which is why, some days, it can be impossible to get an order in.   I remember waiting some nights in excess of 2 hours for my food. Other nights I will call and call, and always get the busy tone (JT FTW). But people, I keep ordering, because it is WORTH IT.   Everything I have had here has been amazing. There is an order I stick to from personal preference, but everything I have ever tried here has been masterfully executed. Drumroll... Sukhothai has no bad days. It's wonderful.  All I would ask is that they open up a second location with delivery. (Khao San Road, are you listening?) There is certainly enough demand for it!"}
{"text":"Sukhothai recently opened up their third location on Dundas St. W, replacing the brunch spot, The Guild. They now have three locations to their name throughout the downtown area. A couple of months back, a friend and I decided to eat at the Wellington location around 6 pm. We chose a good time as we were immediately seated when we arrived, but they did get busier as the night went on.   Walking on Wellington Street E, you will see a plethora of restaurants in the area. However, it's not that hard to miss the giant dark green sign with an elephant logo on the storefront. This location is much larger than their original location and can accommodate more diners.  The decor was a mix of rustic and modern with its exposed brick and comfortable seating. It differs from Khao San Road's communal styled seating. As for the menu, it was a simple two pager showcasing main dishes between $10-$15 and the appetizers are roughly $5-$10 per dish. The prices may be slightly higher than the average Thai establishments downtown but the quality of the food is definitely there.     I ordered the shrimp sukhoThai pad thai ($15) - included peanuts, long leaf and lime, and it came out nicely presented and was good sized portion. The flavor profile was definitely there as I thought that that the Pad Thai had a good balance between tangy and spicy. Additionally, they use tamarind in the paste which is so much better than ketchup which a lot of places use as an alternative.   In regards to the service, our server was brisk but he was friendly. We didn't wait long for our orders to be taken, and the food arrived in a timely manner."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai restaurant in the downtown core. Love their garlic shrimp, Khao soi, pad thai, fried rice and delicious green curry!"}
{"text":"This has become a daily lunch addiction for me. I first found good thai food in Toronto at Khao San Road. The food was excellent and it had a cool trendy ambiance, but getting a table can be frustrating as they don't take reservations other than at the door.   Having tried the Sukho Thai on Parliament I realized that there were some great hot spots that had the incredible sukho flavour without the fuss.   The latest location on Wellington is definitely a hit. Located near Berczy park enjoying their delicious 'lunch curry of the day' al fresca is a great option.   Inside the decor is dark and tasteful with a loud sound system speaker. My only criticism would be that music is concentrated in parts of the dining room that can make it too loud for a casual lunch.   A lot of the friendly staff from KSR were here and the food tastes excellent. Risking the 'thai spicy' Kho Soi the first time there was a big shock to the senses and slightly overwhelming with kick, going for the spicy the next time on the curries was a better call and let the flavours shine.   Very fresh taste with a bite that comes straight from North Thailand. The curries are rich with coconut milk and make the flavours linger. The green curry (gaeng kiaw wan) is great, but I found the gaeng massaman has too much potato for a lunch order and they don't soak up the tamarind curry enough to make them worthy- good taste on the curry though.   All in all Sukho Thai always delivers on a great meal with A+ customer service."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sukho Thai for years. I have a single complaint, and it's a big one: The staff. They never smile, are always completely lacking in personality, and seem aggrieved to be there. Who hires these people, and why are they so miserable? Thai food is fun and delicious. Why is the staff so darned dull and miserable? Ten minutes as owner and I would fire every person I have there as staff. Smile! Be friendly! Be fun! Your job doesn't go any faster if you're miserable. Actually the opposite. Dear owner: I would go there four times as much if the staff was better. It's so much damned work to get a simple smile or some personality. There are so many options on the street these days."}
{"text":"I had the green curry \"Thai spicy\" with tofu. It was so delicious! I can't think of a time where I've had better Thai food. The prices are reasonable and the place is so cozy and friendly. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Way overhyped. First off, the service was terrible as expected. No big deal. That was expected. The worst part was the food! Most of us got pad thai or the sukhothai pad thai. It was TERRIBLE. Dry and overly sweet. Maybe I need to try the curry next time because the pad thai is certainly nothing special."}
{"text":"Points for:   + The veggie fresh rolls. Stuffed with veggies and mango slices and noodles. Excellent thick and creamy peanut sauce for dipping. When I asked, I learned they come with cilantro BUT they are made to order so this can be easily left out. I am one of the unfortunate souls who is genetically predisposed to think cilantro tastes like soap, so I appreciated this detail very much.   Not as many points for:   + The Massaman curry. I'm sure this would be other people's jam, but it's not my favourite. Just thicker and sweeter than I was expecting. I've only had this dish one other time, from a roadside restaurant in Thailand, and the curry then was a little more spicy and soupy and less like a sauce, which is what its like at Sukho Thai. But again, this might be just what you want from your Massaman.   Next time I visit I'm going to check out the classic green curry and the garlic tofu bites because those sound delicious."}
{"text":"If you roamed through all the reviews on Yelp about this restaurant, you may have noticed that it varies a lot!   If you love to experience new flavours and explore the limits of your taste buds, this is one place to go to!  The menu gives you quite many many choices. The plates are all beautifully decorated and the atmosphere is very welcoming!   Two things are important when we go to a restaurant: the service and the food.  FIRST, the service! They're awesome! Really kind, really neat, really polite. And all of that with a smile :)   SECOND, the food! The food is the important part of the important part. The chefs are expert chefs. Thai food is their domain, so if you want to try the real thai food, this is one of the places you want to try! I've had way too much food when I went, so I can't describe one by one... But I can descrive my experience in general! I enjoyed every single dish even though I was about to explode. That ought to explain how good it was!!!  My oncle once said: \"When you're full and you still want more, that is when you start to appreciate all of it\"."}
{"text":"Ridiculous customer service. Might as well be a self serve restaurant as you need to stand up and flag the servers down or you're sitting there without even water for 15 min. Staff is extremely rude. Food is mediocre. Chicken and beef that comes with the pad Thai very dry. The shrimp is not fresh and is soggy/fishy. Would NOT recommend"}
{"text":"The food is generally good here and the price is ok  I have been here more then a few times as I live in the area.  Earlier this evening, I ordered a noodle dish and the chips to go. The cashier warned me about the wait time.  No big deal since I have my iphone with me so I can check the news and answer a few emails.  I waited, waited, and waited.  After 40 minutes, I finally got my food. When I got home, I had to microwave my noodles. The following is the summary of my observation: -Lots of ppl was placing take out orders via the phone; -The place was not full for a change; -the person who responsible for packing the take out was also responsible for the phones... as a matter of fact, the cashier was also responsible for the phone... One of the wait staff was also on the phone... - the take out counter at the back was full of take out to be bagged.  Restaurant is a very competitive business and you have to be on top your game.  There are so many choices out there."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night. Was quickly seated by the server. She asked us for our drinks and came back with them in a few minutes. When she came back we were ready to order. We asked for the shrimp rolls and I ordered the panang curry with chicken. The server then almost walked away without even taking my boyfriends order. We stopped her before she walked away and my boyfriend asked her whats a popular food dish on the menu and she suggested the pad thai. So he said between the panang (because thats what he initially wanted) and the pad thai which do you recommend. She recommended the pad thai and he said okay i'll go with that and she said okay and left. She brought out the shrimp rolls which were bang on delicious. Minutes after she removed our plates from our app she brought out the pad thai with 2 plates. We were a little confused why only one dish came out but we thought the other dish would come out soon. Boy were we WRONG! After about 10 minutes of my boyfriend eating his dinner (me sitting there just nibbling off of his plate) we finally were able to wave down the server and we asked her where my order was. And she said but you only ordered the pad thai... She didn't even apologize for screwing up. I was so sad. We don't come downtown often to have dinner but one of the few times that we did we get not so great service not to mention that I get to starve while i watch my bf eat. I don't know how she had misunderstood because we never said \"cancel the panang and give us pad thai only\" and we didn't notice anyone else sharing their plates with each other so I don't know why she got that impression. Just an overall bad experience with the service. The panang was okay but maybe would have been more enjoyable if the both of us got to eat our dinner at the same time."}
{"text":"For take-out only.  The food lives up to its reputation.  But the room's horrible.  I ended up in the basement -- six tables, dark, depressing."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night for dinner. There was a line up, which is expected. Had to wait 30 mins then my table was given to someone else? The waiter called my name I answered but I guess my name sounded like someone else so they answered too. He took the nearest person! But I got my table in the end. Ordered my food....then it's all downhill from here. First they inform customers they ran out of rice?? Seriously!! Then give our food to the table next to us! Those ppl just started to eat!! Then the waiter came back realizing they have the mistake. Too late... I like their food but I'm not coming back as there's more out there minus all the bad experience!"}
{"text":"The Green Curry and Garlic Chicken? Nuggets were good. The chocolate cake was dry AF though, so you may want to avoid it. Service was great, and the atmosphere was very lively. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Get the pad Thai and thank me later! Amazing Thai food in the city with different options for different palettes. The location is a bit sketchy, but once you get inside, you realize how crowded it is, and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Our small group of friends had dinner here on a Thursday night; restaurant was fairly busy for a weeknight. Food was good; very flavourful however a bit on the salty side for my liking.  We had calamari for appetizer. Portion was a bit small; tasted okay for calamari, nothing exceptional. I probbaly won't get this again in the future.   For entrees, we had: 1) pad Kee mao (basil noodles) with beef. We were happy with the choice, both noodles and beef had good flavours.  2) curry, gaeng panang with shrimp: curry sauce was delish, shrimps were too salty and not that fresh. I was disappointed with shrimps considering you have to pay extra $1 for it.  I would recommend getting this with chciken instead of shrimp. 3) Thai fried rice with chicken. We enjoyed the fried rice, well flavour and very filling.   Great location, good quality, decent portions (we were stuffed), and affordable prices (price is a bit high for Thai food standard but pretty good considering the location)"}
{"text":"I read the warnings about lineups so I came prepared to wait, but on a Saturday afternoon there wasn't one. This is a tiny, sparsely decorated dining room (15 people tops) with only a few dozen framed photos artistically arranged along the staircase that leads to what I can only assume are the bathrooms.  I ordered the red curry with squash ($7.95) with tofu instead of chicken or shrimp. It came quickly and was served with a perfect dome of rice. I was saddened by the squash to tofu ratio though. There was way too much tofu (see pic). I know it sounds weird to complain about that but I was hoping for more squash since, you know, that's what it was advertised as. Quite affordable and a LOT of food - I could barely finish half.  The restaurant is owned by a really sweet guy, his wife and her dad. They told us that they used to own a restaurant in northern Thailand so their menu reflects a more \"northern\" style of cuisine. There are Thai language lessons written up on the menu board that teach you common expressions like \"this is delicious\" and so forth.   NOTE: Don't be a sucker like we were and sit there for ten minutes grumbling that you haven't gotten the bill yet - here you have to go up to the cash register to pay."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends for an early dinner before a show at the Sony Centre. We ordered the Khao Soi with beef and the Thai Fried Rice with chicken. It took around 20+ minutes for the food to come out, which was slightly long, but when it did arrive, both dishes were very delicious. We asked for both of them in mild because I am personally not very good with spicy food. However, if I'm to return in the future, I would probably try for something spicier, because the Khao Soi seemed to be missing a kick that was most likely meant for the spices to be in.   The restaurant itself is very clean (including the washrooms) and spacious. The prices are reasonable and it was overall an enjoyable night. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience we had at a Thai restaurant. Especially since we enjoyed their food so much.  First of, we waited over 45 minutes before any food arrived at the table. We had to remind the waiter that we haven't received our food yet once we reached the 25 minute mark. Once they brought out food, the waiter promptly drops the plates on the table before dashing away. This was our third visit to the restaurant in a month and we knew a thing or two about what the dishes come with. I had ordered the beef and egg rice and it should have came with a red sauce complimentary. We had to remind the waiter to get the missing items for the dishes we ordered. It was kind of annoying and I was definitely not impressed. They never came to check on our food or refill our water. By the end of the meal, we were definitely peeved.   Despite the higher prices, the quality of food and service just wasn't there! I would recommend finding another place, like salad king who cater to more people, have a bigger menu and food comes out hot and fast!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. The taste is very very close to and the same level as khao san road, which I swear by. It is also a bit more expensive with a slightly larger menu.  The downside is really the ambience. It is missing entirely, but at least the food is good, which you can lose yourself in while you immerse yourself at least the first time.   The plus is its usually at least half empty, so with no line, you can walk in have a nice meal and leave."}
{"text":"4.5/5  I'm docking half a star because I like to eat at all hours; but having been in the food industry, I understand.  Just tried the tofu khao soi today. The bowl didn't look big but it was sure very filling! I finished eating just before 2:30pm (when they close for their break). Someone else walked in and they seated him for dine-in anyway. Kudos to awesome customer service! Also very clean :)"}
{"text":"Stop reading reviews and go eat some Sukho Thai! Best Thai food I have had in years. Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to meet up with a good friend of mine back from HK for some nice Thai food.  From what I was told, there's not a great selection in HK, so I had to bring her to a good place in Toronto.    I decided to pick a nice little place called, Sukho Thai that's cozy'd up in a slowly up and coming area.  If you didn't know about it, it would have been easy to miss.  The decor is simple and the minute you walk in, you'll be able to smell the good cooking that's taking place.  As a heads up, this place does get busy so definitely call ahead and get a reservation if possible.  Especially with the recent cold winter, it would suck to wait too long out in the cold on a busy night.  We decided to order 3 dishes and share them together (Khao Soi - $10.25, Sukhothai Pad Thai - $11.25 and Gaeng Kiaw Wan - $8.75 aka., green curry).  The wait wasn't too bad at about 10mins which is quick for what appears to be a small kitchen.  The food had a great aroma and looked nice and fresh.  We both LOVED and I mean LOVED the Khao Soi.  It was sweet, creamy and had a great texture to it.  I like the fried noodles on top and I recommend going with the beef.  The beef used was actually more like beef brisket.  It was tender and mann, just thinking about it now makes me wanna go to Sukho Thai again REAL soon.  The other dishes were also good but after eating the Khao Soi, it just didn't compare.  The Sukhothai Pad Thai was cooked quite well and unlike the other \"authentic\" pad thai's I've had, there's certain spices that were infused in theirs.  I recommend going light on the spiciness to try and taste the food rather than the kick of the chilli.  The green curry was definitely the weakest dish of the night.  I felt it was a little watery and gave me more of a spicy kick than flavour.  Though I have to give it to them, the ingredients used were really fresh.  So maybe it was just a one off.  Khao Soi - 5 Stars, everything else 4.  So go get the Khao Soi, it's definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with 2 friends. The food is great. We had pad thais and a curry with some appetizers.   The service is atrocious. It took almost 20 minutes and 3 requests to get a glass of water. It did seem like there was one waiter who was on top of things but we made the unfortunate mistake of not sitting in his section. The male waiter we had had serious attitude for someone who couldn't remember to bring me water! There were so many people on the floor and yet no service. I had to leave money at the till as the lady manning it left and decided it wasn't worth checking on customers who wanted to settle their bills. Puzzling.   It seems like they take their NOW Best of T.O. award seriously though, as they decided to dedicate a staff member just to filling a chalk board that effect all evening.   Management, you need to train your staff. Seriously. So many reviews about the terrible service yet no change it seems."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I've ever had! Ended up sampling the cashew chicken as well which was fabulous."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this restaurant has lower reviews than its sister location just up the street, but regardless, I thought it was fantastic, and I've had Thai food in multiple places around the world.  The atmosphere is relaxing - it's not too energetic or loud to be distracting, but there's enough going on to make you feel engaged.  The decor and layout are good, especially when considering they want to maximize seating.  Service is friendly and prompt.  The food is fantastic!  I had the fresh shrimp rolls, and they were a perfect blend of a few different flavors - mango, bell pepper, shrimp, basil ... delicious.  I also had the Panang Curry with chicken - it's all about the meat.  This isn't a curry that's too thin and runny with liquid.  Sukho lets the meat and vegetables dominate the dish.  It was ordered medium, had the perfect level of spice and was some of the best-flavored curry I've ever had.  If I'm ever in town again I will make every effort to return to this place."}
{"text":"Four stars due to the slow service. I was here on my visit to Toronto, Decided on trying this spot based on the reviews.  I always opt for the pad Thai before trying anything else on the menu as this is a staple and should be a basis for any Thai place in my honest opinion. The young gentleman who took our order was very kind and brought us pineapple tea with some cookies on the House to snack on while we waited.  There isn't a certain 1-5 star rating on the spice, it's just no spice, medium, or spicy. I opted with the medium and must warn it is spicy. Not unbearable spicy, but enough to finish a bottle of water with your meal so be warned when ordering medium. The pad Thai was really flavorful, not dry at all. Plenty of chicken, and a huge portion way more than any other Thai restaurant that I've tried. The hospitality, food quality, and portion deserve 5 stars. Would highly recommend this spot if you're in the area craving some real authentic Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Fête de bureau tenue dans une des salles privées. Karaoke, écrans multiples pour diffuser des photos ou vidéos et jeux de lumières sur grand écran. Personnel sympathique et accueillant. Les mets préparés sont bons sans plus. Le principe de la soirée était de partager tous les mets préalablement choisis par les organisatrices de la fête."}
{"text":"Delicious- but greatly over priced for what they give you.  I ordered a curry noodle dish that was $15, which seemed a little steep for something that didn't even include any vegetables- just tofu and noodles.  The flavour was amazing though."}
{"text":"Awesome! Visited last night and had the Khao Soi, with beef, Green Curry with shrimp and the pad Thai with Chicken. My mom and boyfriend loved the pad Thai and I'm a huge fan of the khao Soi. The green curry was very spicy with only a medium spice level.  This restaurant is a must and if you like khao San road, you need to check this place out ;)"}
{"text":"Came here after hearing that the creators of Khao San Road were responsible for this one too.  Three of my friends and I came here for dinner after work on night, and enjoyed some great Thai food.  ATMOSPHERE: Very hipster. The space is very large, so they can accommodate larger tables. The lighting is dim though and the black walls add to the mood. If you like modern, spaces with dim lighting and dark wood and paint - you'll enjoy the vibe.  SERVICE: Okay. Our particular server wasn't as attentive as we'd like. We had to wait to get our drinks refilled, and to pay our bill. She was helpful in recommending dishes to try, though, when we were first ordering our meal.  PRICE: Average. Not cheap, but okay for a night out with friends.  FOOD: Very good. I enjoyed the shrimp chips - unlike any I've ever tasted before! So flavourful and accompanied with peanut sauce. We devoured the (very large) basket. The fried spicy garlic chicken was very good too. A bit too spicy for me, although I did enjoy them, I couldn't eat as many of them as my friends with higher heat tolerance than I. :P  My entree was the Sukho Thai Pad Thai. Totally worth getting this over the regular pad thai! It's one of the best pad thai I've had in the city.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Honestly disappointed. We had panang curry, pad Thai, and laarb. All mediocre. If you need your Thai food fix, sure go ahead and at least it's better than the average Canadian Thai food places. But if you're looking for really good Thai food, this is not it. This is coming from a Thai person.   Nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. I've been there many times. The green curry is my favourite. Good for take out too. Reasonably priced.  The one time I ordered delivery, I had guests waiting for dinner. I had ordered over 1 hour in advance and they assured me the delivery will be on time. They came over 40 mins late and I didn't receive an apology for the delay when I called to check on the ETA."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai is consistently the best Thai food in Toronto, and the closest thing to the best homemade food I had in Thailand.  I'm happy with the Wellington location, and having been there 5-6 times since its opening I can say that they've found their mojo. Service was friendly but inconsistent my first few visits (staff seemed quite green and things could take a while), but has improved since. I think the more negative reviews will now subside.  Food:  Highlights are the Sukhothai Pad Thai (get it over the regular Pad Thai) and the curries, particularly Massaman and green curries. Two entrees and an app are plenty for a couple, and I highly recommend sharing as a noodle and curry dish tend to balance nicely.  A note: true to it's Thai roots, even the mild here has a decent amount of kick.  As for apps, spring and fresh rolls are above average and usually come out quickly, and the Tom Yom Kung is nicely balanced with large, fresh pieces of shrimp.  Thai iced tea is nice but very sweet - another authentic touch - stir it around and let the ice melt a bit if you'd like to tone it down a bit.  Atmosphere:  Decor is nice and modern, but the restaurant is big and can get noisy. The best tables are in the side 'wings' by the windows. You'll wait a bit for seating if you come at peak dinner hours, but if I make it by 6:30 I'm usually not waiting long. If you're not up for any of the above, just call ahead for takeout (which takes a while itself, so plan ahead).  Price:  It's comparable to any sit down Thai restaurant but the food is far, far superior. For that reason it's a fantastic deal."}
{"text":"Su-su-Sukho. Did that Phil Collins joke translate? No? Regardless, don't stop reading. Sukho is delicious and worth knowing about.   My go-to's here are the green chicken curry, pad Thai with tofu and spring rolls. The medium spice green curry is my favourite. It's huge and fresh yet hot hot hot. I'll never know how exactly they hit both of those notes so well, which is why I'll keep returning. Often imitated, never duplicated.  As some other people have noted this place is very popular, so the atmosphere can get a bit overwhelming. If this isn't your jam, take off your pants and pull out your phone. Sukho Thai is on Uber Eats."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai stands up to the hype.  Admittedly, I've never dined in, only take-out and delivery, so I can't speak much to their small simple interior. It looks fine enough, and the staff is always friendly. Their website is strangely much fancier than their restaurant, but I love the internet and take-out so I'm okay with this.   When ordering, I lean toward their Khao Soi (medium spice), it comes with perfect glass noodles and it's a beef curry sauce that is just incredible. They package the two separately, so it doesn't get soggy. Their spring rolls somehow feel good for you, which is a nice change of pace from other Thai places. Oooh and try their garlic chicken. It's like chicken nuggets rolled in garlic crumbs with a hot side sauce. Really simple, but dangerously delish.   Go on, Thai one on...  MUST MENTION: Once I've actually eaten their food IN their restaurant, this will likely be a solid 5 star joint."}
{"text":"Waited more than 30 mins when someone told me our table is setting up (i was told 15 mins when i arrive)...Waited 15 more mins for the table to set up...Waited many minutes for a server finally had time to take our order (we asked several times)...We asked to have have whatever ready be served immediately because we were starving.It was 9pm and people started to leave so i thought our order would be quick. However we waited another 30 mins (nobody checked on us even once)and only got the only 2 out of the 5 that we ordered. Rediculously, one of the 2, panang salmon, was the one that we were told \"it will take a bit longer\". And obviously the salmon was cooked a long time ago because it was cold already."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. The place is a little small and there is usually a wait without reservations but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had.  Honestly hard for me to eat anywhere else.  Their pad Thai is the best!  I also love their cold veggie riles.  I've gotten my coworkers hooked on this place!"}
{"text":"This place was amaaaazing. I didn't know Thai food was my favourite until I hit Sukho. Had other Pad Thai, but they are all average compared to here. Food came our quick as well! Server messed up our order, but we're quick to fix it. Def recommend."}
{"text":"Quality at this Sukho Thai location has gone down a bit over the years. I ordered the Khao Soi and found it to be a bit watery. Two of my friends ordered the Pad Thai and one was saucier than the other.  If you're looking for consistently amazing Thai food in the downtown core, your best bet would be to eat at Pai. Despite being started by the same team, Sukho Thai has not been keeping up with the standards that made it famous years ago."}
{"text":"My daughter and I drove 25mins to pick up this food.  When we got home the two containers of curry were in different sizes, but we paid more for one,  when we called the lady she said \"that's how it comes\". If I was told that on the menu or on the phone I would have ordered more food.  Needless to say, we are not big eaters at all and had to get other food  later in the evening.   The food itself was passable at best.  The panang gaeng was ok, the gaeng masaman was horrid!  Lastly we ordered the shrimp chips, there was enough to feed the city in a ziplock bag!  Zip lock bag?  I felt like I went to a relatives house and they gave me leftovers.  Bottom line, overpriced for not so tasty food."}
{"text":"A friend told me about how good the Pad Thai is here. I got it and it didn't disappoint. Portion was also huge, probably enough for 2 meals."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant est en fait deux restaurant. À l'intérieur il t'a aussi Kiyomi, restaurant de tapas coréens. Avant les menu était séparé mais maintenant ils ont été fusionné. Kiyomi à moins de choix qu'avant et fait beaucoup moins tapas avec ces assiettes à 10$+.  Pour la qualité, nous avons essayé par le passé la grillade sur roche volcanique avec boeuf et légume. Très bon et quelques sauces pour changer les goûts.  J'ai aussi essayé les nouilles udon avec boeuf surnplata sizziler. Bon plats remplis de légume et pas trop gras.  Ma compagne à pris le bibimbap et elle a bien aimé.  Du côté des boisson, nous avons pris un Shirley Temple et un bubble the. Les deux étaient très décevant. Mon Shirley Temple goûtait l'eau et le bubble the était pâteux.  Pour le servir, il est à rechercher. On m'a remplis souvent mon verre d'eau mais pour prendre ma commande, wow que ça été long.  Ensuite pour payer, on a du courir pour avoir la facture. D'après celle qui nous a fait payé, à l'heure que nous étions 22h, il manque bcp de staff"}
{"text":"I really really love this place. It is really good Thai food at a reasonable price. I came here with the family, which included two young ones and the place was pretty busy considering it was a Sunday evening. The service is pretty quick and the staff is really friendly.  We ordered the Mango Salad, the Pad Kee Mao, the Garlic Tofu,  the Panang Curry and the Khao Soi. Each dish was extremely delicious. The Mango Salad is extremely refreshing. The Pad Kee Mao and the Panang Curry are very flavourful and have very nice Thai flavours. The Khao Soi is quite rich so sometimes this as a main is more than enough. But it's worth it, it is our favourite dish here.  Great place and great food!"}
{"text":"What an excellent place. Serves halal food.  The food was so flavorful. The chicken with cashews was amazing. Not to mention the shrimp, the fried fish and green curry. Even the kids chicken garlic nuggets were great!  Service was prompt and courteous. Overall it was a great experience. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Food ***1/2 Service 1/2 Ambiance ***  Poor service seems to spoil the experience.  It seems like every time I call or try to come in to sit down, there is always some sort of challenge.   When you order over the phone you get your food with a side of attitude.  I don't think I've ever called the Dundas West location for takeout and not experienced it.    The food is actually good and it's one of the better pad thais in the city.  Portons for the curries are on the small end but are flavourful as well.    Go to Khao San Road or Pai (same owners I believe) for a better experience with staff or if you're getting takeout."}
{"text":"Food ***1/2 Service ** Ambiance **  The first time I tried sukho Thai I was disappointed but I think it may have been a bad night for their chef.   They definitely have some of the best pad thai in the city.    Their curries are decent however portion sizes are small.    Spring Rolls were surprisingly good as they had were filled with mushrooms.     Reasonably priced for what you got.   Don't go expecting to be blown away."}
{"text":"Amazing pad thai, just like in Thailand!! Spring rolls sooo yummeee! All the food in general is very good. Very good service as well.  Food 9,service 9, price...not expensive but not cheap if you know what I mean.  It's a must if you want good Thai food in a cool place."}
