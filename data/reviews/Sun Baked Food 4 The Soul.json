{"text":"What a wonderful little family owned bakery shop for our small town! The bakery smells delicious and inviting. The service was kind, friendly and immediate. The options for decadent pastries are overwhelming. Everything is made beautifully and designed with love and artistry. My daughter now wants to go here EVERY single day before school. We brought a bag full of goodies and they were of course a hit with all the kids."}
{"text":"Sun Baked Sweet Treats is the absolute best! I spoke to Terri a week before we headed down to the Fountain Hills area about ordering a chocolate cake. She knocked it out of the park. Everyone in our group were raving about it the entire weekend. The cake itself was packed up perfectly and even came with candles for the birthday surprise. Terri and her staff went far and beyond my expectations. Thank you once again!"}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY!! There are AAAHHHMAZING treats here! Terri has made a super welcoming atmosphere to go along with her hilarious personality that had my friends and I laughing over our coffee (also REALLY good coffee  by the way!). It's wonderful to have a special little place to meet for coffee and treats that isn't so...corporate. Go and check it out!!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a cheese danish and apple walnut coffee cakes, and they were moist and excellent. I am hoping they will add a poppy seed roll or the like to the menu, in which case I may need assigned parking!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Sun Baked Sweet Shop this morning for the first time. I ordered the pigs in the blanket quiche and it was DELICIOUS! We are from out of state, but will be here for a few more weeks and I plan to go back...the quiche is That GOOD. Terri, the owner, was so nice and her shop is quaint and welcoming.  I suggest you try it if you're near Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Best sticky buns ever!!!! I love the fresh variety of pastries, breads, home made cakes and sandwiches here. I look forward to trying the chicken pot pies and quiche which look soooo good! Do yourself a favor and step on in , the owners are so accommodating as well! I think the picnic pack for the Fountain Park on warmer days is a must do and such a great idea. Will be trying this place again and again!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great find! Delectable pastries breads and sandwiches. I had a really hard time picking out just one cupcake. Terri is such a lovely person. Caring and genuine. I'll definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"Cute little local bakery with very friendly service. They were nice enough to brew up a fresh pot of decaf coffee for us. The two types of coffee cake we had were delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place!! 
Friendly atmosphere, good food. Ignore closed statement they are OPEN for business."}
{"text":"In town visiting my son. Looking for some coffee and a little something sweet. Stopped by this little Shop. So glad I did. I got apple and a raspberry pop-over. And coffee cupcakes. Delicious. Very friendly owner. Definitely made from scratch with quality ingredients. The food speaks for itself. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and stopped in after reading the reviews. It did NOT disappoint!! My husband and I got the quiche, biscuits and gravy, and a cinnamon roll and everything was absolutely delicious. The owner is just the sweetest woman ever and a pleasure to talk to. We will be coming back before our trip is over!!"}
{"text":"Not closed!!!!!! Sweetest, most delicious place in town!!  You have got try it out!! Amazing donuts on Saturday and the best biscuits and gravy ever!!"}
{"text":"She has the best cheddar and bacon quiche. You can taste the love. I followed it with an iced tea. I took home 1/2 loaf of meat loaf for dinner. She makes chicken pot pies on Tuesdays that another customer raved about. My meatloaf comes with homemade bread. Speaking of which, everything is made from scratch. She said if she can't pronounce it, she won't cook with it. What a pleasure to have real food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a great delight to be served by such a charming owner who sets standards for the rest to follow.
Every purchase has been of the highest quality, how do you measure their chicken pot pies ? Well here is the secret, having eaten at least 5 or 6 pies from Sun Baked Sweet Treats over the last few months we happened to be in AJ's of Pinnacle Peak recently. 
We bought a couple of AJ's pies (and a mushroom quiche) - AJ's quiche went into the trash can.. The chicken pot pies, we did manage to eat but suffered all night as the pastry was, well you know.. The filling was not much better.
So the morale of this little ditty, Terri at Sun Baked Sweet Treats sets and maintains the standards and her bakery blows holes in AJ's and her prices are far easier on the pocket....."}
{"text":"So nice, fresh made bread, and wow the apple walnut coffee cake  ,cherry taschen , so good , nice locally owned bakery that definitely will be a favorite Saturday morning treat stop!"}
{"text":"We found this place a few weeks ago and are just delighted with Terri, her pastries and friendly service. My hubby and I loaded up with a ton deliciousness ranging from apple and cherry turnovers, to her mini pies to those out of the world giant cookies. I haven't had a chance to try the cinnamon rolls yet but it's on my list. This is a sweet, charming little place and Terri's cooking feels like home."}
{"text":"OK..... now I tried the carrot cupcakes that Terri makes and they are FABULOUS!!!! Not sure what to try next..,. Everything so far is very very good. And I recommend you try this fabulous little place!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great!  We both had the quiche and she bought out some grits and gravy for us to try.  It was the first sausage gravy that I've had that didn't need a little extra seasoning (tabasco) .  Got some pastries to go and can't wait to try them.  They also make other dishes to take home from scratch like meatloaf, goulash, green beans and potatoes, etc.  Terri is the star here and she'll probably come out to say 'hi'.  She absolutely loves serving great food.  We ate our food so fast we forgot to take pictures.  I told her about a corned beef & cabbage quiche that I saw on tv, and she is going to try that sometime.  Since we don't live here we probably won't get a chance to try it, let me know how it is.  Im sure she'll knock it out of the park!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town. We wanted to try local. This was a great choice. The quiche was great, so many varieties. Sandy was amazing. Will go again."}
{"text":"I have lived in Michigan, Georgia, Kentucky, and Arizona. I have visited 42 of our great States, several countries, and stopped in bakeries in all of them. By and far, Terri and her Sun Baked Sweet Treats are the best. I have never had better cupcakes. As for the chocolate chip cookies, sorry grandma, Terri makes the best!!! If you ever have a desire for something sweet, PLEASE visit Terri, she's a magician."}
{"text":"Sun Baked Sweet Treats is like GOLD!!! Brings back memories of goodies we used to purchase at bakeries in Detroit, MI.  Absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Items are always fresh and appealing and once you take a bite, it's like a taste of heaven.  The staff, especially the owner, is exceptional!!! Very Professional and over-the-top friendly!!! Nice find in Fountain Hills and a great addition to our community!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after having breakfast at Phil's, next door. The atmosphere is very nice and the owner is a great guy. We both had the fresh made sticky buns. They were absolutely delicious. We will definitely be going back to try other things as well."}
{"text":"What a hidden Gem... I have lived in FH for 25 year and I just discovered this cute wonderful cupcakes and O such moor ..I had the biscuits an gravy and cupcake poppy had french toast ... Was Delicious ..!! All made from scratch ...
Beautiful thing 
Enjoy the goodness FH has to offer"}
{"text":"Thank you for the reply, however, I don't believe you are Heinz, but that's fine. 
I do need to mention that the quiche was very good.
Of course your regular customer tells a different story, she is biased by your relationship. I hope that you can hire a front person to provide a seamless experience. It would benefit your business to offer coffee and a danish or quiche to go for us professionals who don't want to go to Starbucks.
The cluttered stuff is the stuff behind the counter, the menu-not legible enough, the jewelry, food items all over the place. 
I come from a family of business owners and even if I had not, I know what great service is, blessings aside, I am very happy, yelp is designed to give one's  opinion and this is mine."}
{"text":"The selection may be small, but their pastries are amazing. I really wish they had been labeled, so I could be more specific. I got three different baked goods. Each was perfectly soft and flaky and deliciously amazing. Did I mention amazing? It's way out of my way, but I'm heading back just to get some more to share."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful quiche and coffee while talking to Terri, the owner.  Great food, genuine people and strong coffee,  what more could you want from a small town bakery!?!  Can't wait to try the chicken pot pie and short-bread cookies next.  Thanks Terri!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a fresh doughnut and coffee on Saturday mornings. Terri is very welcoming and the location is great.  My wife loves the quiche."}
{"text":"What a great place and people. First the doughnut.  I didn't think my beloved Krispy Kreme's could ever be beaten. Well I was wrong. Next were the pretzel roles.  Amazing. The owner and staff were wonderful. Will be back often!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit.  Finally found a pastry shop of my dreams in Fountain Hills!  Great breads and pastries.  The coffee and cherry pastry reminded me of the pastries if my youth!  Oh yeah...  I will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is the best little gem in Fountain Hills! Wonderful pastries and breakfast foods. All home made. Terri is a super nice lady and uses some great family recipes for her customers to try! They are delicious and fresh. Her breakfast biscuits and gravy are my favorite.  Freshly made gravy with lots of sausage. Great coffee and teas available.  The food will keep you full for hours. 4 tables for her customers to hang out and read. No plugs for WiFi so bring your own hot spot and be full charged, enjoy a good book or read the paper while eating some delicious food!"}
{"text":"The name doesn't really do this place justice because Terri, et al, do serious food as well as sweet treats.  Go for both!  Go for the sausage, gravy, and biscuits.  They do lunch and you can get dinner to go.  Everyone in Fountain hills should patronize this place.  You out of towners should go there too.  Small but the folks are really friendly."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Best bakery in the lower 48. Fountain Hills you better support this place you won't find anything better in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"The absolute best cupcakes in town! Terry introduced us to the German chocolate cupcake that was out of this world."}
{"text":"We had a nice piece of spinach quiche and a fresh cinnamon roll. The food was great and employees were a true delight. I even got a back rub, which you can't beat! It's a very warm, cozy, low key atmosphere."}
{"text":"I just enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich for lunch. It was so fresh and delicious, thankyou Terry!!
Whenever I want something fresh-baked and delicious I know where to go."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful biscuits and gravy breakfast here at sunbaked sweet treats. The owner Terri always makes you feel at home and welcomed and appreciated."}
{"text":"This bakery is great. Wonderful pastries and coffee run by a very friendly and talented couple."}
{"text":"You will always be met with a smile, amazing baked goods, breakfast, lunch and take out perfect for home dinner later. Cute lil place and Terri is beyond personable. Supportive of our community in many ways. Places to sit and relax, quiet nook. Love this place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"They definitely have very great baked goods I'll give them that, yet their prices are not realistic to your average household . Example:$4.50 for one cupcake (regular size) would cost a family of four $20 to stop in and have a treat which wouldn't even include a beverage. I'd say that's a bit steep in principle alone!I'm not exactly sure why any small business in a small town  would want to limit their clientele by such a large margin when the locals are your livelihood year round. I fully understand profit is a must   but at the same time such  pricing is more at a gauging level than profit level. I've watched their prices go from so so fair to WOW SERIOUSLY! There's other places that are equally good in taste and quality that cost much much less! I'll obviously be taking my business there!"}
{"text":"Well, just the best bakery I have ever had! 
This is a gem for Fountain Hills. Don't miss Saturday donuts ; )"}
{"text":"We moved to fountain hills recently. The breakfast pastries here are amazing! I'm very particular about pastries...not to dry, not too sweet, etc. Theirs are perfect! I've been picking them up for morning business meetings too and it's a big hit. Faves are apple fritter, apple nut pastry and the fruit hand pies. We are very fortunate to have them in FH."}
{"text":"Always a Treat to visit this Bakery/Deli. Something new every time I come to eat, Terri is always warm and welcoming. Tables are always bussed and Clean, the Display racks are always glistening! Mmmm- the smell of fresh baked goods when you walk in the shining glass door - Truly a Treat!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was treated like family. Even the other patrons waived good bye. Such a nice little independent shop. The staff couldn't be more friendly. The food for me today was a plain cinnamon roll. It was delicious and you can tell it was freshly made.  I will definitely be back. It's next to the fountain park."}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that I have neglected to review. There is ALWAYS something good to be had here - they're more than 'just' pastries and sweets! Bought a couple of slices of quiche the other day, SO good (it was the meat one, I believe they call it the House). The crust was fantastic, my poor husband didn't get much crust on his piece because I took the liberty of breaking a bit off as I put it plated it.
(in my defense, I would have taken that plate but he grabbed it and walked away before I could point it out)
Everything is made from scratch and you can totally taste the love that they add! The serve breakfast and lunch. I highly recommend you visit!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best pastries in this area, the owners make everything fresh early in the morning. The coffee is good and the restaurant is the best coffee shop in town and where you should come if you want a laid back place to meet"}
{"text":"What a Great Find here in Fountain Hills! Had the meat loaf, quiche, and bakery goods! Awesome! Terri the owner is a Sweetheart! Great Personality we hit it off immediately. She has all the ingredients for a successful business here in town! So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Had a butter cookie and a mint chocolate cupcake, worth the drive over the hill!"}
{"text":"I just bit into a slice of the coconut banana cream cake made by Terri's Sweet Treats inside the Sun Baked Pastry shop and it is SO GOOD that I had to write this review. Terri was so friendly and personable, and you can tell she loves baking and sharing her creations. I also like the raspberry popovers. I will definitely be back for more! Cute little local shop that I hope expands with even more bakery & iced coffee options :-)"}
{"text":"i'm taking the time to rate this, because I feel the place has so much potential. the fresh baked breads, coffee and some desserts where amazing. such a rare find in fountain hills, where the food most places is terrible. people in this area make due, cause everything else is far.

however, some of the desserts and quiches, esp the tuna salads looked old and crusted in the showcase window. i'm not sure how long, its been sitting out, but everything looked wilted and not fresh at all.. old tuna salad looks terrible when its been sitting out (for what looked liked days).

the staff wasn't very friendly and again the presentation of the old food, doesn't make for an appetite. i think it has potential.. just work on keeping the food fresh, displays full and you should get more business.

its empty inside and that could be why. food cases look empty and not clean or appealing. please make adjustments, i loved the concept and liked the few things, that looked safe / sanitary to try."}
{"text":"Apple walnut coffee cake is AMAZING.  The owners are really friendly and seem to love what they do.  It's great to have a real bakery in town!  Prices are high, but quality is high too."}
{"text":"We love this place. The service is always great. Also, Some amazing baked goods. Some of our favorites include he caramel rolls, breakfast burritos and quiche. They also make great bread. Tried the sandwiches but wasn't into the lunch meat they were using. The sides, however, were AMAZING. Had the potato salad and then baked beans. Tastes just like my grandmothers! All in all two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Perhaps Denise S is confusing discount pricing for average goods to this top quality, over the top good store.  We're glad to have access to something so special and grateful to Terri for her personalized service.  Keep up the good work of giving to Andre House...what lucky people they are to sample something special on their hard journey."}
{"text":"This is a great place to buy bread! They have a great selection for pastries and other baked goods! One thing I don't like is that they don't have large quantities, I wanted to get 6 cinnamon rolls and they didn't have enough, they really need to not be afraid to \"overbake\". Other than that the place is an awesome little local shop that I love to support! In the summer they have an awesome lunch deal."}
{"text":"What a find!

This place is the real deal bakery and restaurant.

Owner Terri Treiber bought the bakery from previous owners a year ago and has taken the great German recipes and added some of her own .  A delicious mix, to be sure.

The delicate sweet rolls are light and fluffy.  Cinnamon rolls, sticky buns and more.  The Apple fritters remind us of those grandma used to bake.

Cakes are a real specialty here.  If you are lucky, a freshly baked coconut cake will appeal to your taste buds.  All of their cakes simply melt in your mouth.

Pies?  Oh yes!  Fruit pies, sweet potato pie, quiches, too.

Every day is special here.  Monday is meatloaf day, Tuesday is Chicken Pot Pie day (so good!) Wednesday & Thursday is Chef's choice, Friday & Saturday are authentic Indian Fry Bread taco days with melt-in-your-mouth sopapillas for dessert.  Saturdays are also Donut Day.  Go early as the donuts sell out fast!

Sandwiches made to order.  These are the kind that Mom always made...with love and care.

Everything is made from scratch with fresh ingredients.  There are even gluten-free options, too. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow, sooooo Delicious !!!!! Sun Baked Sweet Treats is such a gem, and I'm so glad we stopped in to give them a try. My husband and I are always looking for a good bakery,  and they all seem to be the same...until now! Sun Baked Sweet Treats has the best baked treats I have had in a very long time, and the service there is over the top exceptional (Terri was wonderful). You just don't get that type of service anymore, so going there was definitely a treat. They do serve lunch too so I recommend if you're in the area to stop by and give them a try,  you won't regret it! We'll definitely will be going back for that homemade Chicken Pot Pie. :)"}
{"text":"Introduced to their outrageously delicious (watch out ) pastries, sticky buns, cinnamon buns, apple walnut pastry, turnovers & lemon Danish.  Yes I sampled each, lol) at our  *1st* monthly  breakfast get together at Park Place.  I haven't tasted pastries this fabulous since my Aunt Marie (a Master) died many moons ago.  I will be visiting the store very soon, right after several trips to the Gym...I swear..... FIVE+++STARS, grand slam, home"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Sun Baked Sweet Treats. We were in from out of town and got breakfast and a few pastries, and everything was delicious. The spinach quiche had a unique, smoky flavor that made it one of the better quiche I've ever tasted.  On top of that, the staff at SBST was kind and welcoming, especially to our 10 month old. Next time we are in town, we will be sure to come back!"}
