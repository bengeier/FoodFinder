{"text":"I know some people are going to completely disagree with my 1 star rating here, and to be honest, 10 years ago I would have thought the same; but considering how much the culture of Greek food on the Danforth has evolved in the past 10 years, Mr Greek seems to have been left far, far behind.  Mr Greek has slid to becoming nothing more than a glorified cafeteria. That might actually be giving it more credit than it deserves though, because I've been to some cafeterias that aren't absolutely horrible.  I remember stopping in there in the past and having some pretty decent souvlaki, but what you're presented with now is nothing close to decent. The souvlaki is tough and tasteless, the rice is lukewarm and overcooked, the vegetables were likely previously frozen; bottom line is, this is in no way an accurate representation of what Greek food is in Toronto. Add in the sweaty, pushy serving staff, and you have an all around poor dining experience.  I actually complained via email last time I went, and I promptly received an email back from the owner full of profuse apologies and promises of a better meal, nicer service and an overall better experience if I returned. Although I appreciated his effort, the last thing I want is to be forced another meal there. I know restaurants can have a bad day, and I'm willing to overlook that. But from what I saw, this was just another day in the life of crappy restaurant living of it's achievements in the distant past.  On a street with as many options as the Danforth, there's absolutley no reason (or excuse!) to end up in this joint."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to the \"tourist trap\" style restaurants like Mr.  Greek but this time I had no choice as some of the 1st choices were closed due to long weekend and the kids were getting a bit wild.  Mr. Greek was exactly what I thought it would be serving the usual suspects, Greek style cuisine that is pretending to be authentic but it's watered-down to please most people.  We had the lamb special, mix plate of dips and chicken Greek salad.  The food was mediocre at best but the lamb chops were actually pretty good. (it's hard to ruin lamb chops)  Service was mediocre too, very slow and confused"}
{"text":"I had a hankering for Greek food so we decide to brave the parking disaster that is Danforth and ended up at the new-ish Mr. Greek.  If memory serves correctly, this Mr. Greek took over the old Pappa's location that used to be amazing.  It's a bit lame to see unique family run places replaced by chain franchises but oh well.  Being a veggie there were a handful of suitable options on the menu.  We ended putting together a mish-mash of items to create 2 very tasty veggie dinners.  The \"flaming cheese\" was really tasty.  The veggie souvlaki was fresh and flavourful with the baked tomato being the best part.  We definitely managed to eat until we were overstuffed and happily full.  The service was quick and on message.  Our waiter definitely knew the script and stuck to it diligently.  He tried many many times to suggest up-sell items which was a little annoying but since he was nice enough about it we let it slide.  If he could have turned the enthusiasm down a few slight notches the service would have been perfect.  Can't totally fault a guy for doing his job the way the boss requested."}
{"text":"Just ordered take-out and the cashier was immediately annoyed when I asked a simple question about available sides. Service with a smile is obviously not a policy for this baron establishment."}
{"text":"Avoid! There are way better and cheaper places to eat on the Danforth. I made the mistake of coming here on the advice of a friend. The lamb kabob was good, but they just drenched the rice and boiled potatoes in the same kind of red sauce. It was bland and quite nasty. I thought Greeks were big on roasted potatoes, not boiled. Other than the kabob - which was overpriced - it honestly resembled hospital food.   The service was quick and friendly however - but their food is not up to par in comparison to the rest of the strip."}
{"text":"I had never tried Greek food before coming here, so I don't know exactly how authentic or 'proper' the chicken souvlaki I had actually was, but I DO know that I enjoyed it immensely and was blown away by its general deliciousness and portion relative to the price.  Our server was very friendly and helped us out with a confusing section of the menu (it was unclear how many sides were included in the price for some main courses).  We had to wait quite a long time for our food, but it really was worth it. The comfortable booths, the tv and the arrival of some dishes which were accompanied with fire and flames to the table next to us ensured we didn't mind waiting too much.   Everything was lovely, I liked the large, open-spaced, comfortable layout of the restaurant and am eager to return.  This probably isn't the best option for traditional Greek food on the Danforth, as it's a chain, but it's definitely a fun, cheap, filling and flavoursome choice."}
{"text":"The service, pricing and speed of service you would expect to come from Mr. Greek does not apply to this run down location.    The lack of enthusiasm from the cashier made me wonder of she had a pulse until te phone rang. She picked up the phone and forgot we had existed for a minute.   When the time came to pay we were quickly interrupted by an upset waiter. He was upset he couldn't break a $100 bill for a table he was serving.  This may be because the customer did not expect the over inflated prices normally not found at other locations.   The takeout window did provide for some entrainment as when meals were picked up the waiters decided to pick from the plate and eat as they delivered the customers meals.   Overall the experience was so horrible that after eating out over 100 times this year already I felt it was nessasary to finally create an account to share this experience.   I'd review the quality of the food but it's been 15 minutes since we ordered from the take out menu and I don't think we are going to stick around and wait."}
{"text":"Good food and it's consistent - it always tastes the same. The portions are large so I always end up packing some for home. The only opportunity for improvement would be their decor. It's a little outdated, eg. The places they served us were mismatched patterns - one had a coloured stripe around the time and the others were plain. Ambience makes a difference when you are dining out but the food is good."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  High quality food prepared fresh.  Excellent service.  Souvlaki dinner always a favourite.  The baklava is made with real honey.  Good place to get a solid healthy sit down meal at a reasonable price. Dufferin and finch Allen road area.  Parking available."}
{"text":"Food and service where great here. Quick service, everything we ordered came quick. Waitress was friendly. The food was properly cooked and tasted great (chicken, greek salad, garlic bread) etc). The place is massive in terms of seating capacity. Also has live music (not when we went on Sunday night though). Recommended."}
{"text":"Went there for early dinner on a Sunday afternoon. Main waiter very nice and efficient.  Food was great. We had greek salad with and without salmon, vegetable souvlaki, some linguine dish. Very delicious. A bit sloppy with the order, one salad was ordered without dressing so they both came without it, olives weren't left off as requested.   Coffee tastes like dishwater. One of the waitresses/bus girls..or whatever they're called, looked like she didn't want to be there. The expression on her face turned the milk in my coffee sour. Girl, it wouldn't hurt you to smile, once in a while...even the way you talk/answer to people leaves a lot to be desired.   Not gonna be on my list of favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"The meal is decent. We ordered a chicken souvlaki and the chicken was freshly grilled and the potatoes was in good portion.  The greek salad that came with it was a little disappointing. They didn't even use greek dressing on it. I think it was just italian or something. Not that great, I used some of the tzatziki sauce as dressing.   Price is maybe double compared to a Mr.Greek on a food court somewhere."}
{"text":"I particularly like Mr. Greek delivery.  I know what it tastes like in the restaurant, and I prefer it with my own wine in my own home.  I enjoy gyros dinner, thinking that greek salad, gyros, and greek roasted potatoes is a great dish.  My son enjoys a self made kids meal: skewer of chicken souvlaki, and french fries.  He loves the french fries here.  The complimentary mints are definitely necessary after the tzatziki."}
{"text":"The food was not as I expected from Mr. Greek, we ordered 4 different dishes but none came out the way it should have. The dessert baklava was at least a month old to the point it was rancid but they thought by putting it in the microwave it can be served. A big disappointment all together!"}
{"text":"Rain, rain go away but it didn't and stuck in the wilds of Highway 7 and the 404 it was time to take a break from driving the slippery streets  and so we headed to Mr. Greek.  A huge cavernous space,  we were the only diners save for another couple seated in the corner.  Complimentary pita and garlic bread tasted old.   Our waitress took our orders (there were three) without writing them down and food was served promptly but with all the wrong side orders .  She didn't come back to check.  We were too hungry and tired to complain and the food tasted good enough.   Kudos for a surgically clean women's washroom."}
{"text":"Gyro was yummy and if you order extra pita bread you can make it into two wraps because of how much meat they put on it! Hummus was great, and so was their cheese dip. I love that they delivered quickly. Losing one star because the falafel was really gross. I love falafel and this just wasn't meeting my standards."}
{"text":"Came here with my relatives and my fiance for dinner one night and was pleased with the food and selection. I ordered a lentil soup and a chicken salad. The lentil soup was delicious and was a nice portion. I was really expecting something smaller. Chicken salad was crisp, nice and cold (the greens at least, but the chicken was nice a warm) and the chicken was tender. I got my salad dressing on the side and asked to omit the feta cheese (sorry but just not a huge fan of it). The wait for food seemed a little longer than what I had anticipated but it wasn't bad since I was with family and we were just chatting and catching up.  This place is nice and clean and has plenty of tables and parking out front.  I would love to come back here and try some other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Please renovate!  Food is ok but go to danforth if you want authentic. Pantheon still top rated for me."}
{"text":"Even though it's cheaper than the other greek restaurants in the area, it's not worth it.  Basic dishes are not done right.  I had the fried calamari and it was undercooked.  And the saganaki opa was also undercooked.  Service was sloppy."}
{"text":"We were a very large group (60+), soccer players & families, having a celebratory dinner @ Mr. Greeks last night, and the service was impressive RIGHT from the moment we sat down. The staff was very pleasant & accommodating to EVERYTHING we needed, from bringing out water & all the bread we wanted as the crowd was coming in. To making sure we had enough seating and going along with the way were to put our food orders in for each family. They always had a genuine smile, were not phased by our HUGE noisy group, and were very efficient and absolutely provided wonderful service!!!! Just so REFRESHING to have excellent service in a restaurant, especially for such a large crowd. We got our food in good time, And of course the food was delicious! We wanted to THANK all 4 waitstaff and the bartender for making our night so enjoyable, and will definitely come back and also recommend Mr. Greeks to everyone. THANK YOU so much! From the Cherry Beach Dragons team & families"}
{"text":"I feel like this Mr.Greek is almost left forgotten about by the owners. The interior is outdated and the exterior is lacking polish.   The food is very well done (see pictures) and the service is great too. My souvlaki was so juicy, the veggies were grilled to perfection.   However, the fried calamari could have been more crispy and golden, and the salad could be cut in smaller sizes.  Other than that I think the restaurant should work on the overall look. There are no flowers outside on the patio, there's litter on the floor, and it looks almost apart of the parking lot.   The interior is super cheesy and blasting Greek techno music which is nerve wracking. I do like the cool fish tanks though."}
{"text":"Just visited this restaurant last night for dinner and we had to walk out because it was so terrible.  I've never done that before.  The place was near empty (it was around 9pm on a Monday night) but we waited a few minutes for the waitress to seat us.  She placed us in a booth which was nice, but the table had bits of food crumbs on it.  I asked whether she could wipe the table for us and her response was: \"Why?  The table is clean.\"  We asked again so she unwillingly got a rag, and proceeded to wipe the table but in a way where all the crumbs ended up in our laps.  Still pretty gross thinking about it.  They need to fire the waitress otherwise they will definitely lose business."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I went for a birthday dinner and the waiter was impatient, rude and then has the audacity to add on gratuity tip included in the receipt. First, service was horrible by the waiter named Theodore and then he added tip which is above 15% into the receipt. Never did he come to us, not even once during the meal to refill our cups, and when placing our meals in front of us, he unnecessarily placed it harder unto the table. When taking our orders, he rushed us and never even smiled until we made a complain to the manager. IF, most likely wont, I ever do come back I'll be definitely asking for a different waiter."}
{"text":"I know the foodie snobs reading this will scoff at my review but I'll damned if you're gonna find a better value on the Danforth. This place has an unfair reputation as the place for greek \"fast food\" but what the hell do they know.   Firstly the service last night was outstanding, took my uncle from Edmonton and he enjoyed himself (I know that's a damning statement but he's been to Greece so there!)  Tons of fresh hot bread, good portion sizes, and better than expected quality. The lamb chops were decent sized and very tender, the moussaka I could do without.   Unlike the other popular places on the Danforth there was lots of premium patio space on this hot summer like day.   I prolly wouldn't take a girl here on a first date before I sealed the deal, but I'd definitely take her as a girlfriend after the fact."}
{"text":"Ok food. Portion is not as large as other private Greek restaurant. About $40 for two people including tax & tip"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Ordered the gyros and it took a while to come. While it came from the spit, which was roasting by the window, the gyros was cold to the touch. Obviously wasn't fresh. Fries were soggy as well."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  Poor attitude of manager. As a regular customer of a few years I would expect to be treated better. After all if it was not for paying customers this business would not be open!  This will be my last visit to this place!  They just kissed  $2500.00/year in business!"}
{"text":"I had gone to this Mr. Greek for my mother in law's birthday celebration just this past Saturday.  This restaurant has 2 entrances, one facing west and the main entrance that faces towards Hwy 7.  The west entrance (where I parked) is only for take out.  I did see the sign but I went in anyway hoping there was a short cut through the dining area and there was not so unless you are there for take out you have to go through the main entrance for the dining area.  We had a table for 12 and the backs of the chairs adjacent to the wall it was tight but there was enough room for myself to get around but it was still sort of tight.  We were a large party and it was one of the larger spaces we were in the restaurant.    The server looking after us was very welcoming and seemed genuinely happy to be serving us.  I like that.  I like knowing the person helping us on a special night is in a good mood and looks like they are happy to help us.    We started off with some drinks first.  The only 2 beers they have on tap was Heineken and Coors Light so I went with the Heineken.  As for appetizers I started with some fried calamari and grilled octopus.  My meal had come with a small Greek salad so that came out early as well.  The calamari was a good size and I shared it with our side of the table.  The other side appeared they had also order a calamari so that was already being shared over there.  We received some bread as well which wasn't that great but it wasn't too bad either.  Basically they seemed to be toasted long buns cut to make several pieces.    I liked the calamari.  It wasn't too salty but it also came with a two side tzatziki sauces.  I essentially used one to eat the calamari and I saved the other one because I can never get enough tzatziki and I noticed on the menu they charge an extra buck for more.  These things are sort of small.  I knew I was going to need more than one for my main.  The octopus was amazing amazing amazing.  I love grilled octopus and these portions were cooked right and were very tasty, dense, and meaty.  Everybody that I shared the octopus with said it was very good as they enjoyed it as much as I did.    For my main I had ordered lamb souvlaki cooked medium as well as rice and fries for my sides.  I sometimes order potatoes but I had felt like having fries.  My wife had ordered the chicken gyro with rice and grilled vegetables.  As usual she couldn't finish hers so I had the honors.  The souvlaki was ok.  The meat portions seemed smaller than what I am used to getting at Astoria.  The chicken gyros however was really good I liked the vegetables as well.  Having the extra tzatziki sauce helped as the chicken is dry without it.    Overall the food was good and the service was very good.  Being a group of our size we had an automatic gratuity of 15% added which was appropriate."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very good service and food is also good. My daughter and I both love coming here when in the area !!"}
{"text":"I'm not too crazy about Greek food and I'm definitely not crazy about franchises, but I'm definitely interested in how vegan/ vegetarian friendly Mr. Greek is... and I'm sad to report that it's not a very veg friendly place, for obvious reasons.... they serve meat on sticks and they roast meat in a vertical column!! OMG!  My choir came here to dine after our big Christmas concert last Saturday. The restaurant saved us about 40 seats in the back of the restaurant so we could dine in peace at 10pm. Being a carb-phobic and a greater calorie-phobic, I was sad to see everything so heavy and so full of my 2 greatest fears.  However, being super hungry after a big concert, I got over my carb-phobia and sought out a veggie pita on the menu... which they didn't have. They had a vegetarian entree with a stick of roasted veggies, rice and sides, but that was too much for a dinner at 10pm. So I settled for a Greek Salad, sans feta cheese. The salad was good, yet quite pricy for something so basic, but it satisfied my hunger... but  it still didn't curb my craving for a veggie pita.  Good thing the restaurant had endless baskets of garlic bread and toasted pita bread on the table. So I guess I did get my pita! Yay!"}
{"text":"Ordered up some food with my lawyer. Had the chicken dinner. No complaints as far as things go - was nice with the rice. I will, however, say that they are pretty fast with the pick up orders.  Only issue is that it's a little pricy for what I consider to border on fast food. Just personal opinion.   I'd give them a 8.5/10"}
{"text":"I know the Danforth well, and I have avoided Mr. Greek for a long time because it is a chain, there are so many better options nearby, by a friend (who is Greek) said the place had new management, and was very good.  Based on that, we decided to try it.  The waitress was very nice, and seated us right away, the place was pretty empty for a Sunday night, our seat was behind the kitchen, so we saw the whole place.  I should have taken the emptiness as a sign, but we stayed anyways.  We started with an appetizer of Keftedes (basically 5 individual meatballs covered in tomato sauce, served over tirokaferi (spicy feta)) The appetizer was very good, we were hungry so polished it off quick.   Then we waited for our mains, nothing fancy that would take a long time to prepare, I ordered gyro's and rice, and my girlfriend ordered chicken souvlaki with roasted potatoes.  Being that our orders were simple, and the restaurant was nearly empty, the fact that it took 45 minutes to get our food was crazy I would understand if the place were packed and the kitchen was swamped, or the restaurant was short staffed (not the case, as several servers were milling about the front of the restaurant)  Anyways, my gyros were just ok, and my girlfriends chicken souvlaki was very dry.  I don't think we will be back, the appetizer was very good, but the wait killed the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet: got a quick bite to eat and it was really great. Delicious garlic bread to snack on and a fresh meal on top. Our server, a young lady named Valeria, was a total sweetheart and worked her best to accommodate our gluten allergy. The only reason I put 4 stars is because I think the value could be a bit better but the food is quite good!"}
{"text":"Greek food is one of our faves!  This location is very good! The food is always tasty and fresh, the take out is quick and organized. The patio is very nice in the summer, however not all the servers are great, and could be a little slow at times."}
{"text":"Came here the other night to show my cousin Greek Town and it's back to a three star. Food was a-ok again."}
{"text":"This review is based mostly on delivery. We've ordered from here for work several times lately and I am consistently impressed. The chicken souvlaki holds up very well on the drive over, and this place isn't really close to the office. It's always juicy, never dry, delicious. The rice and potatoes are both great sides. The tzatziki is super thick and wonderful. The only thing I don't really care for is the baklava because it's coated in cinnamon or something and I'm not a cinnamon fan. They bring us a mountain of food for a reasonable price. I'm looking forward to dining-in soon based on delivery experiences."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery with a friend one day.  They came in under the hour as promised.  I ordered a gyro on a pita with rice on the side.  To begin with the rice was tasteless. The gyro pita was yummy, had a decent portion of the meat, but it lacked the toppings, thus making it look like the stingiest pita I have ever had.  Unsure about stingey? It just means cheap or holding back due to the fact that they are cheap.  Tough competition with many other Greek places I know of."}
{"text":"As I live on the Danforth, I have the option of getting Gyros from any number of places. Mr. Greek is usually my top choice because it is delicious. End of story."}
{"text":"Both food and decor were pleasing but the service was horrible. We were there on a Tues night, the place was pretty empty so there really was no reason as to why the service took so long. When the staff did remember us it took repeated requests just to get a second glass of water."}
{"text":"Superb quality of food. Office team ordered effortlessly online the menu is detailed so it help alot. The online order said 1 hour delivery and they delivered in 20 minutes super fast. Food was very good orders kebobs, gyros, salads, Greek salad was delicious and fresh the gyro combo set was very good better than the chicken kebob. Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite casual dining locations. There seems to be a different between franchises and this one is truly very good. They have a nice comfortable patio, and the restaurant itself is almost brand new.  I love the size and quality of at least 2 of their appetizers: the grilled calamari and the grilled octopus. They are both well prepared, tender and very tasty. I have had the souvlaki, and the roasted Mediterranean chicken and both are tasty and well seasoned. They also feature a plentiful Village Salad with nice chunks of good feta.   This place is not for fine dining, but for a reliable, good quality meal with very good service. They do feature a bunch of promotions, which don't seem to be advertised such as 2 for 1 appetizers. These could use a bit more publicizing.   Its a nice place to hang out with friends, especially outside, during the summer."}
{"text":"Worst take out experience ever. Waited over an hour and didn't get the right food we ordered, and didn't get all the parts of the meal that we should have gotten in order for us to even eat our food either. Wrong appetizer, incomplete meal. Upon calling the restaurant to let them know of their error, they questioned and implied as if we were lying and then didn't even offer to have what was missing brought over right away. It was only until after I got upset and told them to bring the food over today that they hesitantly claimed we'd have to wait another 20minutes for the stuff to be brought to us. Upon speaking to the \"owner\" - Martin he refused to make any amends for the error and simply said \"complain to corporate\" if you don't like it. Don't waste your hour wait for horrible service and potentially risk not even getting the food you ordered."}
{"text":"Picked up take out here the other night.  2 things...I went on a day when Greece was playing in the world cup.  Major fail.  The entire Danforth was a hot mess.  I should have totally checked the news first.  I had the unfortunate luck of ordering behind a gentleman who ordered food for 14 people, who each had 14 different requests.  I kid you not, there was a list on paper, and...the girl behind the cash had to ask him a question about each order that was written down.  Yes, that happened.  I simply ordered the specials..2 gyros for $10 and 5 pork souvlaki sticks ($8.75) to go.  The food was ok.  The gyro is pretty tasty for $5 in my opinion.  There wasn't much of a dining experience to speak of.  It's ok here, and gets the job done when you're hungry."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Just ordered delivery.  Fast, prompt and courteous. Chicken souvlaki was very good. Tender and moist. Vegetables were cooked perfect, potatoes were delicious. Dinner came with 3 small Greek yogurt containers and whole wheat pita bread. Will definitely order again when in town."}
{"text":"I usually only seem to go on Yelp to bash a place when I've had bad experience. Not the case this time! I've been here at least 3 times for business and really enjoy the food!! Great Lamb Chops, Chicken Kabobs, Bread and Veggies!!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"this place is closed down"}
{"text":"Consistently friendly service, clean, and good food.  I have been here more than once and I liked it.  Some of the waiters are very charming and I have received very friendly service overall.  The food is good, and servers are quick (even when it's busy).  The grilled calamari is really really good!  Their portions are huge, I like taking the food home too."}
{"text":"Mr. Greek was like THE original Greek restaurant before it franchised itself out and I've seen it go through its reincarnations. It may be considered fast food fodder or as Mariko puts it \"The Milestones of Greek Food\" and not as exquisite as other Greek restaurants but it is reliable on certain things.   VIBE  White walls. Greek music. Macho waiters who always make sure your water glass is full. Great patio off the Danny. Busy. Families.   EAT  This is where carbs go to die. It's all about the Chicken Souvlaki dinner with rice and roast potatoes. And that orange sauce. That is the craving that keeps me coming back and I always get extra. It's like having infinity extra dill pickles.   I don't care for the iceberg lettuce salad and you can substitute.  I wouldn't bother with the saganaki or the baklava (outsourced from Seranos). I've never had their gyros here but I usually would get it at Messini.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  An old stand by. Great for that day when you're having a craving. Also, great take-out, pick up desk."}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery here.  This place is hit or miss. Sometimes you get everything you asked for quickly, and sometimes they take a while and forget something like salad dressing for the Greek salad, and you have to wait longer for the driver to come back.   On a good day, I got a single dinner delivered in under 30 minutes with no extra fee for 2 substitutions and delivery, totalling roughly $20. This is a great value when it comes to delivery!  On a note-so-good day, I get the same thing but it takes 45 minutes to get here, the garlic bun is with barely any garlic on it, and they forgot to include the dressing for my salads.  The meat, all 3 times I've ordered, seems to be consistently somewhat dry. My expectations are not high for delivery in general so I wasn't expecting out-of-this-world souvlaki so this doesn't really impact my rating. It is still flavourful and the tzatziki makes up for it.  Good value for Greek delivery. Much more impressive when they get everything right though. It's crazy how an impression can go from 5 stars to 3 stars... I gave them 4 to average out my experiences. If only they were consistently awesome, I would love to rate them higher."}
{"text":"This location is very surprising. When I think of Mr. Greek I think of a super casual restaurant with crappy interior and stereotypical decorations. This is not your ordinary Mr. Greek. There is a lot of dark wood, nice big bar, flat screen, wine bottles displayed on a dividing wall, big booths, and a weird but helpful staff.  The food here is like any other Mr. Greek, pretty good but nothing crazy. Get the lamb shank it's cooked perfectly. The staff here are a little different than your average bear. They look at you for a tad too long, stand awkwardly at the table, look uncomfortable, and a very quiet but they are all very nice and helpful. I can see how some people may find the staff here rude but its just them being different. They are definitely not rude. Very helpful and awkwardly funny.  Overall, this is my favorite Mr. Greek just because of the decor. Parking in this area is horrible on Friday and Saturday nights but come any other time and you are good to go. Prices are the same as the other Mr. Greeks but it feels like you get a lot more than you par for because of the ambiance."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the food & service today, both of which have gone downhill. Ordered lamb chops & sautéed vegetables, asked for chops to be grilled medium & no broccoli in the vegetables. Both these instructions were ignored. Chops were so well done they were charred and I choked on how tough the tiny pieces were. Never saw such tiny lamb loin chops. Waitress claimed they were weighed. Weight must have all been in the bones! This place doesn't care anymore. Won't come anymore."}
{"text":"management in this restaurant are bunch of crooks.  they have large poster right next to the machine where you pay for parking INSIDE of their restaurant window that states that they will cover up to 5 dollars on 20 dollar purchase.  They refused to reimburse me full ammount claiming thats old poster and were rude and unaccomidating.   I dont care about 2 dollars but its a mater of being honest or not.  Obviously they are not.  So they get 1 star.  i wish i could leave 0 star for this dump."}
{"text":"The waitress was very respectful and well behaved. Our food was brought on time and it tasted amazing. I never have been to a restaurant as good as this one."}
{"text":"It is alright for what it is, I suppose. However, it is impossible to eat here if you are a vegan. We went here twice, and the waiter refused to acknowledge the difference between vegetarian dishes and vegan dishes. As a result, the penne pasta came with a cream rose sauce, as well, the soup had cream in it as well. This made things worse, because, 3 members of our party were high lactose intolerant.   In addition, most things are cooked in a meat stock, so, I wouldn't recommend this establishment for vegans or conscious vegetarians."}
{"text":"Being the proud Greek I am, I decided to visit this place with my family. Overall the food was decent, obviously not compared to Greece, but very good. Although we did wait a little bit for our food, it was worth it.  I ordered the Saganaki (flaming cheese) and was delicious. Anytime you have melting cheese right in front of you, you're going to have a great time. The souvlaki was very good, not dry like some places, but just the right tenderness. Although I wished the interior was more decorated to bring the 'Authentic Greek' feel, I do hope that this place stays open for years to come.  3.5 burps out of 5."}
