{"text":"We had a really lovely meal here on our first night in Montreal. The cheese plate was delicious and HUGE, the wine we ordered was very good, and we ended up going with the special they were running that night for our entree. I had vegetable soup and trout, while my boyfriend had salad and steak. Everything was really good, and the service was perfect.   There seem to be a lot of poor reviews for this place, but my experience was lovely, and I would absolutely return. Also - get the creme brulee! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and avoid this restaurant. I had to make an account just to warn people of this restaurant. Me and my friend ordered the roast beef sandwich and it was the most unholy devil food I have ever tasted. The meat was like chewing threw a rubber tire. If the knife couldn't cut through the meat, how are my teeth supposed to do it ? Honestly STAY AWAY me and my friend felt sick and disrespected."}
{"text":"Do not come here   Had the special of the day which consisted of what tasted like watered down Campbell's asparagus soup,  salad from costco, (frozen) seafood (from a bag) linguine and creme Brule,  which still had huge chunks of brown sugar in it for $34.95.  I don't think they actually cook anything in house,  they probably just warm up food and serve it to you at the table.   I question the cleanliness of this place.    Service was horrible,  food was horrible,  I hope I don't get food poisoning later.    Wish I checked reviews before coming"}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant where I had one bite and wanted to immediately leave. The French onion soup was water with bread and a few pieces of cheese in it. My fiancé's fish and chips was one piece of fish, soggy fries.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Worst place I've been since my vacation to Montreal. Ordered a steak strip loin with fries, fries is so hard and the steak is so tiny and small! My wife got a pasta with shrimp, its got no taste. The grilled chicken salad was so simple and bland. Not recommended, never coming here again."}
{"text":"I just finished a meal and thought I'd check reviews;  first to come up says \" problem #1:should have checked reviews \".   I ordered lobster special...simply terrible. Creme Brule dessert was good. Cute hostess outside only good part...actually service was friendly and good.  Food just plain bad. Should have read reviews!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced drinks, horrible coffee.  There is nothing authentic about this place.  A shame considering the location."}
{"text":"Just move along. This place is run by a crook that feeds on tourist that won't be back in Montreal and over charge them for mediocre food because they have a nice patio... Just move along nothing to see at the St. amable"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at. Prix Fix menu = overpriced, overlooked junk. Lobster was baked with broccoli mixed in (???). Terrible. Soup was just a purée of old vegetables and no flavor. Osso Bucco was a joke. Then, live music. Horrendous. Do not eat here. Ever."}
{"text":"The hawker in front of this place is super aggressive. Got us. Stopped for lunch, mussels + fish and chips was $35. Mussels were plentiful and good sized, but pretty flavorless. The fries were ok. The salad that came with lunch was pretty limp.   If you are looking for overpriced mediocre food you'll find it here.  The setting and location is very scenic, but quite cramped."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Mostly, I loved the muscles.  I thought they were excellent."}
{"text":"I don't know why people gave such low ratings. This place is pretty great in my opinion. We came around 9pm for a late dinner. Ordered Osso Bucco, Liver, lamb shank and a pitcher of beer. The food was ready in minutes and was honestly pretty good. The three of us all agreed on that. The waiters are friendly and attentive. The location is great especially for dinner since there are street artists around playing some good music. I honestly don't know how this place could be so bad."}
{"text":"Mistake one- not checking reviews Mistake two- choosing the empty restaurant with the pretty hostess outside  Sat outside- good \" specials\"  menu (see pic) glass of sauv blanc The salad is on the lean side- see pic The bread was good- right to my as$ The steak- ordered medium- got it well- lil rubbery.  Overall- PASS!  The server and owner YES OWNER Erik- is cold/ distant / robot like. That's what happens when you're 50+ and hate your job- it shows. Never did a touch back or follow up. The host is more attentive.  Oh well. Lesson learned.  Is tip included? If not -here it is.... Pretend to care, maybe smile and maybe you would get a tip. Ugh"}
{"text":"We had the fish and chips and the Parisian Crepe (ham and cheese). The fish was good. The fries were okay as well. The bechamel sauce on the crepe was tasty but the dish was covered in burned cheese. The vegetable soup had no flavor. This may be a good place for drinks perhaps, but not the best choice for a meal at this price or in this area."}
{"text":"It wasn't all that bad. But it wasn't anything exciting either. I missed the spices, the flavor. The soup was boring and tasteless, so was the salad. Tho the presentation if the main course was really nice. Also the steak was on point and very tender. All in all I wasn't really impressed."}
{"text":"We had lobsters menu (soups, salad, lobsters and dessert). The soup was good and the salad was really average. The lobsters was good, I think. Not as soft as I was expecting it to be (first time I tried lobster) and the cheesecake was good as well.  The staff was really nice and kind.   The experience was ok, not sure if I would go again."}
{"text":"If you could give zero stars, this would get it. This was the most horrendous meal maybe of my life. Sadly we didn't read the reviews before it was too late. The service was slow and inattentive. I can't tell you how long our water glasses were empty all night, or how long we waited for the check, or how long we had to wait until someone even acknowledged we were there to eat once we had been seated. We would have left immediately, but they made us put down a deposit. I thought \"how terrible can it really be?\"  The food was just bad. It lacked flavor and just truly wasn't good at all in any way. One course was a cheese stick with a sprig of grapes...true story. The sauce on the chicken was also the dressing on the salad. It was just BAD. Bad bad bad. THEN, to add insult to injury the bill was INSANELY expensive and they added a million dollar gratuity.   Lastly, the music playing was so loud I felt like I was at a rave. The restaurant is so small, and my husband and I were screaming at each other from across the table in an attempt to hear each other.   This meal will haunt me. I'm so upset we paid for it."}
{"text":"We stopped in here because all the good places that were recommended were full and had a wait. This restaurant is also in a prime location. And because we didn't read the reviews, we paid the price!  It took 2 requests to get a clean water glass. After that, it took a while to get our orders taken. At this time, we started to feel like we made a bad decision. But because we were hungry, we stuck it out. Again, a long wait before we got our food. No bread either. The bathroom was dirty and old. The food was just ok, if not a bit overpriced. The waitstaff were clearly uncaring. They treated us like tourists, not expecting to see us again. As we were now in a bad mood due to the poor attitude here, we didn't enjoy our food at all and couldn't wait to leave. Looking at the other patrons, no one enjoyed their dinner either.  Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!"}
{"text":"What an unfortunate experience. I made a yelp account just to write a review for this miserable establishment. My friend and I ordered the roast beef sandwich and it was absolutely revolting. It was STONE COLD! I asked the server about it, and he looked me dead in the eye and had the audacity to say it was meant to be served that way. He tried to convince me that the beef was MEANT to be cooked, refrigerated and placed between the breads of my sandwich without a visit to the oven or even a goddamn microwave. It was completely inedible, tough and tasteless. I tried to eat it while it was still inside the sandwich but my teeth simply could not manage such a feat. Whenever I tried to bite through it, I was able to get through the bread and lettuce but my efforts were quickly halted by the bulletproof beef.  It was simply a sign of GREAT disrespect to bring me such a putrid and unholy slab of rubber. I am still haunted by this experience. Please, for the love of all that is holy in this world, STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Ok, let's be honest, this place seemed risky.  We came for lunch, my son wanted fish, and we rolled the dice.  And the result: good!  Service was attentive and friendly.  Mussels and sole were high quality.  The cook on the fish was perfect.  A good portion of mussels for the price.   We sat on the patio, and the street traffic and energy was relaxed and comfortable.   I'm sure that the other reviews were authentically bad experiences, but we found this place to be completely acceptable for a nice lunch.   The only thing I can find wrong with it is that the patio structure was somewhat dated and tacky and needs a refresh, some paint and some love.   Thanks for a good meal!"}
