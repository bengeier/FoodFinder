{"text":"After reading some great things about this place, myself and my boyfriend decided to check it out one Sunday afternoon. I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research. 

This time around, instead of just us two, we invited 3 more couples to join us. My first impression of the cafe was spacious with a nice plain brick wall and art work on the wall for sale, features I've noticed in other popular brunch places. One drawback to this place was their beautiful front counter was facing toward the wall; it would have worked much better facing toward the doorway with fresh cupcakes on display.

I also noticed that no music was played in the background, a feature I enjoy. The menu was a foldout with two sides plus the back listing drinks, as they also serve beer. Our water was served plainly, although a nice jug full of water with mint leaves and lemons would have been an extra nice touch. I ordered the Big Breakfast ($11.95) and earl gray tea ($1.50). 

I'm guessing they were under staffed or I sure hope so because one of their kitchen staff sporting a hairnet was going around taking orders as well as serving food, not exactly eye pleasing. I hope this isn't their usual wait staff head wear.  

After 30 minutes, our orders arrived, although the long wait could have been attributed to the size of our party. The portion sizes were massive, you get two sausages, two bacon strips, two eggs any way you want, potatoes, pancakes or French toast, fruit and pre-buttered toast. My poached eggs were on the runny side as I like mine to be somewhere in the middle. The bacon was good, but had no hint of any other extra flavor. The sausages were a bit overdone and dry. The potatoes were nice and crispy, the pancakes were nice and fluffy, however, none of the fruits in the fruit salad complimented each other and were instead all very separate flavors, you could tell there was no thought put into the dish. We also found the meal to be quite cool and not hot at all. My earl gray tea was served in a nice tea pot but was a bit on the thin side. 

The bill for the two of us was $30, pretty good price for the portions that you get, but more suited for someone who just wants to be fed as opposed to someone who wants to enjoy what they're eating."}
{"text":"Breakfast is outstanding! Good size portions. Delicious fruit and salads. Staff is attentive and the setting is comfortable. A great place!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a brunch restaurant that serves your staple eggs and bacon on a Saturday, and decided to stop by Gayleys. Gayleys had a good vibe, and reminded us of Montreal brunch places. They have decent food and prices. However be prepared for terrible service and long waits. We tried to ask for a coffee refill and our bill at the end of the meal and the server kept on ignoring us. Will not be back."}
{"text":"A decent breakfast for a decent price. Good coffee and space to chat and catch up with friends. A nice quiet place on Dundas west for a meal and some sunshine."}
{"text":"SUper slow service, and when I was almost finished my sandwich I noticed the bread was moldy. At that point I was to frustrated by the long wait to bother saying anything. I paid my bill and left.
I will never return."}
{"text":"I visited this place on Saturday morning,  and despite it being busy the waitress seated me within a few minutes.  She took my order quickly, and was very attentive. The food was perfect, not too salty.  I wouldn't recommend large groups because this place is really small."}
{"text":"I've been here since they first open. Really good deal for big breakfast
They used to have homemade cinamon bun, but they no longer make that...i'm very disappointed.

I came back again on Jan 14th, we ordered a big breakfast and a toasted bagel to share. The big breakfast comes with toast, two eggs, pancake, sausage, bacon, home fries and fruit salad. It's definitely a steal for $11. Normally, we share this and add a side order. The only thing that doesn't satisfy me is their coffee... but I'm okay, I'd just visit other cafe later that day. It would be nice if they can improve the quality of their coffee.

I'm not sure if they take reservation, but they do get full around 11am on weekend, and they only have about 10 tables. It's easier if you come with a smaller group."}
{"text":"Well, I am writing my review based on the take-out service that I get, and quality of the food.  In this neighborhood (I work around the corner) trying to find somewhere healthy to eat is next to impossible.  

Gayley's Cafe is one of the few places within blocks that has a fairly low carb option.  I got the large chicken salad... and I was blown away.  It is darn good!  And they made it for me really quickly.  So if you are looking for good food... this is a great place to go for take out lunch.  I\"ve also had their hamburger, ham&cheese sandwich and a number of other items.  All of the food at this little eatery are quality, and tasty."}
{"text":"Over an hour and a half wait with no explanation until we asked twice and they said they forgot about our order second time around. Many other great options in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to second Melissa J's sentiment of loving the food, but hating the super-slow service for this place. The slow service has been a problem with the place since it opened years ago, and the owners haven't really managed to ever fix the problem. I don't know whether they have physical limitations in terms of kitchen size or just not enough people doing the cooking, but the a lengthy wait is almost always a given, especially on weekends.

If, however, you're prepared to wait, and you want to enjoy spending some time hanging out with a friend or reading the newspaper, then order a coffee or tea (or apparently a beer, as I saw this afternoon at brunch), kick back, and relax....and then thoroughly enjoy a delicious, made-to-order meal that is really worth the wait. You really can't go wrong with what you order -- it's all good."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the previous comments about having to wait a bit for the service but the food is worth the wait. The sandwiches are deadly."}
{"text":"Really want to love gayley's since I live just around the corner and it's locally owned. But I'm always so frustrated by the service... 

The staff/owners are quite friendly and do give the impression of wanting to please. That being the case, I think they're part of the group of restauraneurs in Toronto who Just Don't Get It. They drop menus and then leave you sitting for 20 minutes, oblivious to the fact that you're growing increasingly desperate for caffeine. Or they bring food but completely disappear after that - no quality check or offer of the bill or presence at all. They Just Don't Get It.

I can't bring myself to give them fewer than three stars despite all this because the food is quite good for the price and feels like an actual human prepared it (especially the sandwiches... Mmm). And they're so darned friendly! 

This is a place that I can enjoy if I go in with no time constraints and an understanding that the service will not be 'service'."}
{"text":"Really nothing special at this place.  Food is average and I mean just average.  I had the steak and eggs and I dont recommended it as it was sub par. For whatever reason service is slow considering its not a big place and they cook the same food daily. Waitress was nice only reason for the 3 stars."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday morning for brunch here. The cafe was just opening and I was early for my appointment so I sat at a window-side table with my espresso watching people walking on the street through rain drops on the window on a very rainy morning.

Soon we ordered standard breakfast - a vegetable omelet which came with the regular assortments, followed by a stack of three pancakes (yeah, I was very hungry) which was allright as well. I like generic food diners, this was a notch above old greasy spoons and a notch below other fancy breakfast places. Priced appropriately to keep you happy.

Service was good, coffee was decent and food was predictable. Overall not a bad place for brunch."}
{"text":"The food was bland, the waiter loud, the tables messy, and no daily newspaper -- or a mess of Toronto star. Cheap and ok if you just want to grab a bite, but nothing to return to. Sadly, E.L. Ruddy is closed for two weeks."}
{"text":"Simply the best breakfast. (Yelp says my review is too short)... Ok
Simply the best breakfast, did I mention they make the best breakfast in town?
The breakfast is amazing."}
{"text":"Was hoping my experience at Gayley's was unusual, but after reading some of the reviews looks like service issues here are chronic (the bad chronic).

The food was quite good for breakfast fare (traditional options but not as greasy- and at a ~$8 price point), the space is warm and cozy, and the staff are all very friendly. 

The problem was that they have trouble managing crowds - people waiting / many tables taken up by one person (where's a bar for these lonely jokers) / slow service / had to get up to fill our own coffee after forgotten  (also: they don't have a coffee pot to walk around and fill up tables...so every fill up requires a trip with a cup behind the counter for the server... inefficient even when not busy). 

If I wasn't such a care-free and easy going / handsome guy...I would have been real steamed at the waits. Lucky for them.

I'd go back if I saw it wasn't busy / they figure out the service part a little better."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Gayley's several times while in Toronto and every time i do, say it'll be the last time. When in the city I stay in that neighbourhood and sometimes get lazy to stray too far from home base. However, with more options in that neighbourhood - Beaconsfield Village, I have no reason to return.

So, the food is actually not bad, generally, but over the 5+ years I've been going to Gayley's the service always sucks. The family that own it are quite nice, they just have no clue about service, maybe it's a cultural thing, who knows. But I've waited forever to get my bill, and other time I've waited 30 minutes just to get them to take my order - AND THE PLACE ISN'T THAT BIG! Other times, they've never come back to offer more coffee, or see if everything is ok.

I ate there today and the hash browns were cold. They did kindly bring a plate of hot, fresh hash browns. Again, I had to go up and pay the bill vs. waiting for someone to pick it up.

The food is standard breakfast fare. Pancakes, waffles, omelette's, etc.
Nothing too special about anything, but they do, do it well. Portions are enough to satisfy most people. The prices are modest - between $7-9 for most breakfast items. Good value, it's just the service that is bad. The easiest thing to fix.

With the numerous options in this part of the city, I would have to say, try another place, or just pick up a coffee to go or some pastries which they serve on a to go basis. 

Sitting down to eat there takes wayyyyyy too long and there is just no reason for it other than they just don't get it. It's not too much to ask that waitstaff hustle, to see if you want a coffee refill, see if you want anything else, be quick to take someone's order, or bring back their bill. The service is so bad at Gayley's I've actually timed it before to see if, ever, the son that works there, actually comes to give us the bill or see if we want anything else. 

I hate to give a family place such a bad rap, and like I say the food is ok, but really to be fair to my audience, I have to convey that you need to book several hours if you're going to go here just to account for the laissez faire service."}
{"text":"My go-to for brunch. Amazing steak and eggs, yummy homefries, wonderful atmosphere. 
This place has been a solid 5 star in my books for years now."}
{"text":"The breakfast was perfect, just always packed so expect a line each and every time you go during peak times...which I guess is always. I think the hostess was eastern European - abrupt but meant very well. What a hoot!"}
{"text":"Well the owners have definitely fixed the wait problem! I was seating in less that 5minutes and given a menu, ordered drinks and food quickly and then was brought everything within reasonable time. I probably was only there 30minutes! 

I had the french toast and a hot chocolate which both were good. The french toast was pretty good one slice was amazing but the other 2 just needed a few more minutes to be super crunchy. The fruit it came with I was actually impressed by which is always a bonus. The hot chocolate was ok, I think it was just one of the packet ones, though at $2.50 I wasn't complaining.

All in all the service was friendly and the food was good - nothing to write home about but tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing food and good value. The portions are large and the food is delicious! I would recommend the all day breakfast!"}
{"text":"Remains one of the most perfect spots to read the paper and have a sandwich. 

It's as casual and low key as you can get. The servers are always friendly and are always welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is ok - they have a nice menu selection and most dishes taste good. I have one big complaint here - they put mustard in their hollandaise. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS? you don't mess with hollandaise sauce - it is classic and stands up on its own. 

Thankfully I ordered the hollandaise on the side so it didn't ruin my breakfast. 

Please don't mess with the classics."}
{"text":"Cozy, reasonably priced place on Dundas West. 
I live just beside this place and come several times a week. 
The atmosphere is so inviting, and everything is decently priced. The food is good - can't say it's the best brunch I've ever had - but good value.
Definitely the sort of place you can come back to with friends every now and again."}
{"text":"My friends and I were passing through the area around 2pm and were looking for somewhere to have a quite late breakfast and drink at the same time. Gayley's was perfect for this. I had the avocado breakfast and it was huge, priced well and tasted great! Not to mention the fast service as well. Cute little place that's worth a stop by."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews about the service, I was apprehensive to devote a precious weekend, with a trip to the AGO on the docket.  I must say that the owners must have also read the reviews, bc they were falling all over themselves to make sure we were seated with menus promptly.  Very friendly, and bonus points for looking like Dustin Hoffman.  The Eggs Benny (I consider myself an avid EB eater) were outstanding, with a hint of dill.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went there (just a party of 2) on a Sunday, but around 12:30 so I think we missed the brunch rush since we didn't have to wait for a table. Loved the decor and friendly vibe of the place. I didn't have the bad experience service/slow wise as the other seems to have had...our waitress was extremely friendly and the service was good. Coffee came right away, food took a normal amount of time. no one else looked annoyed in there from what I saw. I ordered the banana pancakes with fruit, and they were the best pancakes I seriously have ever had...tasted crazy delicious homemade...fluffy AND a bit crispy, just made perfectly...loved them...and got a nice amount of fruit sprinkled with icing sugar. My partner got the 'big breakfast' with french toast, and he LOVED it also. coffee was good, and I had an americano which was also great. maybe it was helpful again going later in the day, but I had a great experience and will definitely be back for those pancakes!"}
{"text":"Good brunch, loved Spanish omelette. Gets a bit busy on weekends so you might wait a minute longer for food.
Service was good and we had fun every time we went.
Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Solid little cafe that has been serving my weekend breakfast needs since moving back to the west side. The food is simple but tasty. My only caveat is that while the home fries have a good flavour, they seem double cooked and some of them come out very overcooked. 

2 standard breakfasts (eggs with bacon or sausage, home fries or salad, and toast) along with a coffee and an orange comes to just under $22 after tax.
Still waiting til I'm hungover enough to try the $13 hungry man breakfast. 
Time will tell before I commit to that much food though..."}
{"text":"One of my Top 10 breakfasts of all time. 

Everything was nearly perfect. Two meals, sausage, bacon, pancakes, home fries, eggs and toast cooked exactly as requested. 

Side of fruit was refreshing. 

Coffee was hot and service was attentive without being cloying. 

Had the day's paper, but wish they had wi-fi."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I just finished eating at Gayley's this morning. 
We arrived their at around 9am and where served right away. The staff was very friendly and stopped to greet us. 
We both started our orders off with cappuccinos (mine had hardly any foam which was a bummer). Shortly after our drinks were served we got our meal (We both ordered the eggs, sausage, pemeal bacon, toast and home fries) Over all it tasted very good. It didn't taste greasy like a lot of other breakfast places we have tried. The homefries were crunchy but just needed a little more seasoning. Also if you don't like a lot of butter on your toast make sure you tell them you want light butter! 

One thing i do agree on is they don't check up on you once they give you your meal (I am perfectly fine with this though) Sometimes it  gets annoying when people come to check on you while you are stuffing your face with food!

I will definitely return back here for some big cheap breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few years. Seems to be family run! 
For breakfast, it's certainly amazing. The food is good quality, good amount, tasty. If you're just running in for a snack like a cookie or croissant, I believe they're some of the best on the street - and they're large! As far as lunch goes, they have an amazing burger as well. 
The only reason I give a 4 star is because the coffee isn't that great. There's a few other spots on the street that make a really robust coffee and it does trump Gayley's. That said, this place is consistent and yummy and affordable. Big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I wrote a scathing review a year ago for Gayley's about finding a truly revolting number of hairs in my food. The management contacted me and personally apologized/offered to make things right if I gave them a second chance, which I think deserves some credit. 

Here's where the new review begins: I came back, out of curiosity, a year later, without the management knowing. The food was thankfully hair free! And if I'm being honest, it was a damn good breakfast. Fluffy pancakes, fresh fruit, Fluffy scrambled eggs, good bacon/sausage, good home fries. Loved it. Excellent breakfast. The poor single server was a little overly busy looked like she could use some help, though. 

The terrible experience of my first review is still relevant, because it happened. But today I had a lovely breakfast that I would recommend to anyone. I think I'll be back. And if you consider my last experience here, that's really saying something!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's small and intimate. I don't like line ups so its size does create potential for this though. In the end I go for late Sunday brunches (2 ish) and they've always tended to my friend and I with care. Their menu offers a little more than just your standard greasy spoon fare, which is fun, but I'm an eggs over easy kinda guy anyway ;)"}
{"text":"The place was really nice. Pancakes were amazing and a waitress was welcoming! It's a great place for breakfast or brunch with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Cozy café with Mediterranean flair. Thanks to the lack of wi-fi, this place is a welcome break from all the hipster-ized coffee shops in the area.
Gorgeous all-day breakfast choices at reasonable prices, especially if you're looking for a more healthy and/or veggie option."}
{"text":"Took an hour an half, food sucked, don't go, way better resteraunts near by. Eggs were over done. Took 30 minutes to get a coffee."}
{"text":"I got this place to deliver from Doordash ( a new delivery company) and I was excited to try it out. As soon as I open the food everything looked over cooked...... Sausages were literally black and extremely burnt.. Home fries looked over cooked aswell. Extremely disappointed won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Great service! Breakfast here was really good. And the place has a charming and sunny vibe. Definitely a good plan B when the Federal is closed."}
{"text":"I've noticed a couple of people have already brought this up, and it is absolutely true: this place has slow service like you have not seen! I would understand if it was a huge brunch place and they had 30 tables to juggle. There was 6 different groups (or rather tables), and we literally waited for an hour to get our food. Absolutely absurd.
And, not only was the food slow, the service was almost non-existent. We had to call the waitress multiple times: call her to get a refill on the coffee, call her to get water (multiple times for multiple people - what kind of place just does not bring out water for everyone??), and then the wait for food...oh the wait. I did notice that some of their staff are a bit older. Lovely, great that they are employing people past their \"prime working years\" or what not. But you can employ them as an accountant, or as your cleaner, or as someone who deals with \"behind the scenes\" type of stuff, not the very crux of your business. Sure, the good was ok (wasn't even that great), but to wait for two over easy eggs, with a side of raw avocado and baked beans, really should not take an hour. 
Definitely not going to be coming back here."}
{"text":"I am fussy about how my eggs are poached and I am always happy with my eggs florentine here. The pancakes are really good to, not the fluffy kind, a little more dense, but superior in flavour. Service can be slow, but the food more than makes up for it. Just go with a good book or an interesting person."}
{"text":"OK, I still love Gayley's. But...

I went there this past weekend and our food literally took about an hour and a half. And during the hour and a half, no one came to fill my water, or to even apologize. And it's happened once before, so I thought it was a one-time thing...

I'm sorry, Gayley's. I love you, but you're so so so slow. I was starving the other day and the wait almost killed me. Plus watching other people enjoy their food...it was unbearable. I love you, but I'm only going in downtime (aka not for weekend brunch). You guys definitely need another person in your kitchen."}
{"text":"An excellent option for a cozy chill breakfast or lunch. 

I love that the whole menu is all day because then you can mix and match and satisfy whatever random craving you are having. Breakfast? Sure. Soup and a tuna melt? Go for it. Salad and huge cookie? You got it.

I went in for a late afternoon mid-week lunch break with a friend, after spending the morning doing work at Loveless next door. My friend got breakfast food: eggs with avocado, fruit, and toast, while I opted for a bagel and cream cheese with a small caesar salad. Both were good. Nothing super special but definitely tasty and well portioned for the price. Living around the corner and having never been, I'm feeling a little silly for missing out this whole time. Its the perfect spot for a quick and easy meal alone or with a pal. 

Note that payment is at the counter. We didn't realize and sat waiting for our bill for a while like suckers. Don't be like us, be better :)"}
{"text":"I eat clean so I always have random request. Chef always tries his best to accommodate. Staff are super friendly. Food there.... AMAZING !!!"}
