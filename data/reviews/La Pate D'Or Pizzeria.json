{"text":"Excellent large all dressed pizza. 20.00 dollar indulgence did not disappoint. Watched the dough being rolled and toppings applied. Fresh vegetables...peppers. The right amount of cheese. Zesty tomato sauce with modest thickness of crust. Next time will try a less pedestrian choice of pizza."}
{"text":"Yes! Finally a pizza place with good quality, delicious and inexpensive pizza!Their pizza is TO DIE FOR!! Especially their white pizza with carmelized onions. Yummmmm!

Ok let's backtrack for a second.. Sorry, my excitement for this place got the best of me.

This is a cute, tiny little restaurant/pizzeria on the Nun's Island tucked away in a corner with a very nonflamboyant sign on the outside. At first, you might hesitate to go in, but once you do, you'll realize you've hit the pizza jackpot. Armed with tons of delicious and creative pizzas, everything is custom made fresh right in front of you and ready in a short 15 minutes. If you're in the mood for sides, their fries are amazing and so are their small cheese pastries. They also have some Arabic sandwiches (manaeesh) if you prefer but we haven't tried those yet so I can't really comment.

The people who work there are courteous and friendly, prices are great, and food is not just fresh but well made and delicious. They also deliver so pick up the phone and check them out! I'm sure you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Just tried the pizza and it was really good. It was made fresh in front of us and was nice and warm when we got it at our table. 

It was a bit greasy but I like it when the pizza is juicy. Slices were thin but not crunchy. 
We got the four cheese with extra bacon and one of the cheese was blue cheese. It was a bit strong but I liked it. 

The staff is really great. 

I will say the seating is less than ideal. They have four tables for two and half of those wobbled. So get to go."}
{"text":"Nice service, good variety of the toppings. The place is kind of as they rely more on the delivery orders :)."}
{"text":"I'm ultimately very happy to have this pizza place in the vicinity of my home. The variety of pizzas is really nice, the ingredients are fresh and that makes for guaranteed delicious meal. The crust is not very thin, which I like for a change. The prices are competitive and the delivery is timely. The pizza will be at your place within maximum of 30 minutes. There is an option to pay with a credit card if you are short of cash. I still haven't tried some of the typical Arabic foods they offer nor their poutine, on my to do list as the quality of the pizza indicates everything else made in Pate D'Or will be yummy."}
