{"text":"I took a friend for dinner and we were told we couldn't order Thali for dinner. They charged extra $5 for rice and $3 for 1 piece of nann. Dinner for 2 without drinks was over $50. It was very salty and the worse part was we were sick right after dinner."}
{"text":"This place is honestly a hidden gem.  I had food catered from here last week and everything was on point. Had guests messaging me the next day asking me where I HAD gotten the food from.   Each dish had it's own authentic taste not just a bunch of masala thrown together in oil to give you heart burn like most Indian joints.  Don't let the size of the restaurant fool you.  The Chef/owner takes real pride in his food.  Recommend: Chicken Do Payaza Suba Shaam Ras Malhi"}
{"text":"We ordered naan, aloo gobi, and shahi paneer. Their food is amazing! Food tasted very rich and the portions for take out could feed at least 3-4 people. The naan was very different than what I am used to, however, it was one of the best naans I've eaten.   The staff were very friendly and offered suggestions for other items. Restaurant is very clean.   Again, two minutes away from home!   I would definitely come back here :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Good food, best thali in town - you can choose from any two dishes on the menu, and you get a complete meal for $7-8!  The only ridiculous thing is that you pay extra for dine-in: maybe because they are mainly a take-out restaurant and since the food is so cheap, they charge it due to additional cleaning costs.  My suggestion is that they should have a different menu for dine-in with the cost factored in, so that customers don't get startled at the till.  Otherwise, totally deserving of 5 stars. This place needs more publicity: the food is authentic and reminded me of home."}
{"text":"Decent fair prices.  Very quick turn around.  Not much to say...i had tried the tikka wrap, the butter chicken, .  I always do pick up here.  Very typical place.    Hmmm not much to write about as its a quick in and out?"}
{"text":"Had their Kashmiri shrimp and fried fish pakoras today with tandoori roti and 1 garlic naan. Really flavourful gravy with tons of garlic. Can easily tell it's freshly prepared. The fish was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Quantity is pretty decent too, especially for the money. Usually seafood can be tricky with Indian cuisine but they did a good job.   Overall a good Indian joint in the area!   Want to try their thali and Chana bhatura next time around."}
{"text":"Was passing by to go home and was craving Indian food! And I'm so glad I turned into this place! Let's be honest, not the greatest place to dine in (doesn't help that they do charge a dine in fee - add $1 to each food item) BUT don't judge the food due to this. Take out is the way to go! Had their butter chicken, plain naan and chicken kebob. Butter chicken was definitely on point and I like that you can choose the spice level (mild, med,hot) the plain naan was so good, wonder how their butter naan tastes! Will get that next time for sure. The kebob was good as well, just a bit dry but the flavors were there (I just drenched it in the chutney they gave)  Overall this is definitely a place to try! Can't wait to go back and try the other items! They've got a pretty big selection of dishes (btw their thalis are only during lunch time)  AND it's 5 min from home! YAAS!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant where you have to pay ADDITIONAL to dine in. Oh well, I guess first time for every thing. $1 for dine in per person is charged at this place.   We got take-out, 2 dishes and naan to go. It took 10 mins for the food to be made, not bad for a Friday night 8 pm-ish. This might due to the fact the restaurant was completely empty ( probably due to the dinning surcharge). The place was decorated with minimal. I think 6-8 tables and chairs.   Food was alright. It was scalding hot!! The dishes were fine, at par to the 'norm'. However the naan was burnt and soggy. They had creative/interesting  naans. See menu.   The food was on the pricy end considering everything. I most likely would not go back unless I am in the neighborhood."}
