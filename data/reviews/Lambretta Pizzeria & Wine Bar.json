{"text":"Wine choices were middle of the road.  Tortellini was very salty with little flavour. Veal parm was just ok and waitresses killed a bug at our table. Come back? Nope

Ok the pizza out of the oven looks good but the rest of the menu - not sure"}
{"text":"Good pizza comparable with all the thin crusted nuovo Italiano pizzerias popping up. The pasta is also good. It is kid friendly before 8 and more adult-y after. Great if you have kids but still want to eat well."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and I thought it would be relaxed. Not so! Loads of children running around. I like children and all, but there were two kiddos literally crawling around on the floor under tables.  Just not my jam. Ended up just getting a glass of wine and leaving. 

Hopefully next time I'll get a chance to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Would definitely not eat here again. Just bought a $20 pasta and I was so disappointed when I opened it. It was so small and there was just nothing to it. I don't like leaving one stars but this one calls for it."}
{"text":"Was in the area looking for a place to eat and saw this place by accident... Looked new and gave it a try.   Pizza was awesome, very authentic and service was great.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed by the aperol spritz. It was tiny and tasteless. They served it in a champagne glass? Included ice? $12. They were out of the eggplant Parmesan and they had no sangria even though it was on the menu. The food was just okay. Nothing to go back for."}
{"text":"Since moving here from Chicago ten years ago, I'd all but given up on finding good pizza in Toronto. Hand to God, the first pizza I ever ordered here arrived with kielbasa as the sausage. Since that first pizza, it's been spongy crusts, undercooked doughy messes and burnt toppings. After awhile, I gave up and just started making my own. 

The other night, in need of something for dinner and with absolutely no expectations, we decided to try Lambretta. We ordered the puzzola and the beet salad. They said it would be ten minutes and that was no lie.

The crust was cooked perfectly and had a good bite to it. The addition of gorgonzola added a welcome tang. My Canadian husband loved that the sausage was crumbled on the pizza (instead of sliced and actually pepperoni). He also found the owner to be extremely hospitable. Another selling point was that the pizza wasn't so prohibitively small that we couldn't share it. With the delicious beet salad, we had a terrific post-movie meal.

Lambretta is everything we've been longing for in a pizza. If the quality continues, we will be devoted customers. Thanks for proving to us that great pizza could be found in Toronto."}
{"text":"My partner and I heard the hype about this 'hot and new' restaurant and decided to give it a try. The atmosphere was well decorated but incredibly noisy. The service was pretty slow and the food was bland and over priced. The arugula salad which costs 14 dollars consists of little more than salad mix and dry prosciutto with a stingy sprinkle of cheese. Upon taking our order, the server asked if we want penne or fettuccine. We both chose the latter. However, upon receiving the bill I was surprised to find out that this added 4 dollars to each pasta dish. This wasn't noted clearly in the menu and the waitress didn't inform us either. This seemed like a sneaky money grab. This fresh fettuccine was actually not appealing at all. Overall, this was a complete and utter disappointment. Roncessvalles has many better restaurants to offer."}
{"text":"Love Lambretta, the food is great and the service is great too. Recommend you come time to time and try their foods. Pasta, Pizza you name it..."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and for the most part I am impressed. There are a few things that they should consider in order to elevate their food. We ordered bruschetta to start. It was mediocre. By adding some feta and some balsamic drizzle to the top it would have elevated the taste. The canadese pizza was really delicious. For dessert, we had a dessert pizza with cinnamon apples on top. It was good but could be elevated by adding a caramel drizzle to the top. We did order wine and thought that their choice of wine glasses need updating. They only seem to have one type of one glass which doesn't necessarily work with every type of wine served. They should invest in wider base wine glasses. Overall I would recommend. Hopefully these recommendations will be taken to heart."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! I had the Lambretta special pizza, minus the prosciutto because I was in the mood for vegetarian (I'm sure it's delicious with the prosciutto too though). It was HUGE but it was thin crust and it was all I was having and I was hungry so I ate the whole thing myself!

The service was very fast and friendly, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant were very pleasant and modern. 

I will definitely come back here! The pizza was made from high quality, authentic ingredients, and I didn't feel stuffed in a bad way like I do at other pizza places. I felt great afterwards."}
{"text":"I was a little dissapointed by the food here. The staff is super friendly and non-pretentios but the quality of the food wasn't great. I had a salad and a pizza, it was just ok."}
{"text":"Had a pretty crappy pizza from these guys. Service was great and my pizza was ready quickly, but when I picked it up it had dry areas where sauce should be (note the 'swirls' where the sauce is missing') and the dough was tough and salty.  Overall the flavour was bland and tasted as if it had been sitting for a full day."}
{"text":"First off reserved online here on yelp. Noted we had a person in a wheelchair. No call to tell me they were not wheel chair accessible. I was told quite snidely I should have called to ask. 

Worst white sangria ever. Had only citrus in it  and was extremely bitter.  Didn't continue after first sip. 

Smallest dinner salad ever. They cheap out on everything. 

Bolognese sauce was horrible. 

Latte was just dirty water. 

Service was slow as they seemed short staffed and our server was everywhere. 

Was given a bill ready to pay and then it was taken away and I was given a much higher one because he forgot the drinks. I thought he was quick and noticed I didn't drink my sangria and didn't bother charging me. 

Oh well. I won't be back that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Reliable service.  We think the pizza is a bit better at Delfina up the street (we go to both on a regular basis) but Lambretta is pretty big for Roncy so you can usually get in without too much fan fare."}
{"text":"On a whim, we decided to check out this brand new restaurant (opened last Monday) and were very impressed!

Lambretta's specialty: Roma style cooking. Pizzas (in a big stone pizza oven) and fresh pasta.

On the owners recommendations, we started with Spanelle which is chickpea flour fries with a spicy aioli sauce. It was different from anything we'd had and a really fun way to start the meal. A perfect dish for sharing!

Next we shared a pizza. The pizza is a little different than the Neapolitan Pizza that's so popular in the city right now in that the crust is a little softer and easier to chew but still very thin. The flavours were fresh and delicious. We loved it!

Pasta: We upgraded to the fresh pasta (an extra $4) and were so happy we did. They make it in house and will add it to any of their pasta dishes. 

Kid friendly? Heck yes. This place has a little toy/colouring station for the kiddies and a children's menu/activity page. We arrived at 6:45 and the place was full of families just finishing their meals.

By 7pm all the families had left and the vibe was casual with a really warm buzz, the perfect atmosphere for connecting with friends or a casual date night.

They have one television away from the dining room in the waiting area. It also has a few cool places for single diners to stop in for a bite.

We're excited to go back and try the rest of their menu. I can only imagine it will be just as delicious. This is definitely a welcome addition to the hip Roncy strip!"}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum yum yum yum yum. 

Okay, this was good. 

The menu has a great variety. Awesome salads, meatballs, pizzas, different apps, and the pasta...I am going back for the pasta. I didn't try the fresh pasta but I had some of the penne and what ever they are doing with that goddamn sauce is some kind of magical elixir. I don't really eat pasta, on account of the fact that I totally lift, and I don't wanna overload my carbs #brolife but I am going to go back and eat some of this pasta. Maybe a lot of it. Maybe just a few teaspoons. No one knows at this point. Except god. Who doesn't exist. 

So anyway, the atmosphere in this place is awesome. They made some great changes and it feels like a space you want to hang out in. Which is exactly what I did. Inside my own personal body. I also had a chance to meet the owners who were very nice. Pro tip; got a problem with something? Say something.

Also, while they have a nice sized TV if you want to watch the game, you would never know it's there unless you sat at the bar. Which I might sometime. But I might never do it.  I'm unpredictable that way. You might find me in the far back corner as far from the TV as possible. You can't cage a bird, so don't even try. 

Hilarious that anyone would complain about their home made poutine. They make their own gravy and it's really friggin tasty. Especially when it's in your mouth.  I just drooled all over my own keyboard. I am going to go talk to the owners and see if they will buy me a new keyboard as a result, or at least pay to have mine cleaned. If they don't, I will be back and I will post a 1 star review. 

GET IT TOGETHER LAMBRETTA."}
{"text":"We were nearby at St. Joseph's hospital, so, while my wife was waiting, I picked up a pizza to go for the both of us.

To me, what takes them from a 4 to a 5 is that while I was waiting, I remarked on the great beer selection they have there.  As a treat, the server gave me a sample of a limited edition beer.

The pizza came quickly and was nicely cooked.  Given the great pizza choices in the city, this competes well.  I'd say just a touch below Libretto and QMP.  When in the area, and yenning for something simple, I'd do this all over again.  I'd bring friends here too."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza done correctly in the oven and a host of nice wines. The only crap thing was the music. Didn't go with the environment at all. Since I'm moving to this hood a year from now will go back. Amazing pizza."}
{"text":"I have to admit I'm pretty surprised by the enthusiasm for this place, so I'm going to preface my review saying it may have been an off night.

on the positive side:
- nice environment
- kidzone to allow adults to eat their dinner in peace
- open concept kitchen that says \"we've got nothing to hide\"
- food was fine with definite potential for being really good.

on the negative side:
- big TV over the bar instantly communicates this is not a nice restaurant. Maybe it turns into a bar atmosphere later in the evening?
- service was unbelievably slow
- super limited menu. a handful of pizzas, a handful of pastas. someone put all of their energy into an overpriced wine list.
- the signature pizza that everyone loves so much literally has a handful of arugula dropped on top of it. As if someone spilled it. My guy was also displeased with all the charring. its supposed to be wood-burning oven, not wood-burned pizza, right?

I would only come here again if I was dying for gourmet pizza and Pizzaria Defina up the street had a line-up and I couldn't walk any further than Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"Wow, not getting the five star reviews here. If you see my other reviews, you will note that I am a pretty generous star-er but this does not warrant such glowing reviews. I wanted this to work- it was easy to get in on a Saturday night and the atmosphere is quite nice and lively. I agree with another reviewer about the Tv over the bar playing sports that can be seen from everywhere in the restaurant is tacky, I did not love the pizza despite the fact that it came out of a proper wood oven. I ordered the sausage Gorgonzola one that the waiter told me was the best pizza they made. Really? The crust was soggy and the texture was very average, the sausage was bits of ground meat that were not special. We were a group of seven and everybody ordered different kinds of pizza so this was not a sample of one dish.  The chicken pesto one looked good but it also suffered from soggy crust. If all you make is pizza and pasta, you should do a really exceptional job on your pizzas.  The bill was also pretty high considering the quality of the food. We picked good wine after our first two choices were not available which  helped. The service was unremarkable. There are so many other great options on Roncy- Delfino is much better pizza. Try 9 down the street, Ace, Barque. This place will only survive by overflow if people can't get in elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really, really great spot. 

Service was friendly, and we were seated right away (by the owner, nevertheless!). We didn't even have resos. 

Food and drinks came FAST! So awesome, especially being that it was Saturday night. 

The atmosphere was also very charming and warm, would be a great place to take a date. 

Food tasted authentic and delicious. We ordered pizzas and dessert and nothing disappointed. The waitress was super friendly and on point with everything. 

Prices were very reasonable. About $75 for wine, beer, 2 pizzas and 2 tirimisus (sp?). 

5/5 for sure. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Perfect thin crust!
Great variety of pizza. 
Try with Amsterdam beer."}
{"text":"This is my current favourite pizza spot in Toronto. Their thin crust pizza is a good as anything I had in Italy.  Watching the pizza is great fun from my favourite seat.  I eat here at least once every two weeks."}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and decided to go for an early dinner with our two young daughters.  We arrived at around 5:30 on a Saturday and there was plenty of space - the tables were filling up when we were leaving though.  I love, love, love that it is very kid friendly while still having amazing grown up food.   They have a kids menu, crayons and a little play area in the corner with some toys and a chalkboard wall.  My girls both had the kids salami pizza and my only complaint would be that the salami was too spicy - we picked it off and they ate their cheese pizza happily.  My husband and I both had pizzas and they were very good - thin crispy crust and large portions.   Our waiter was very friendly and the food arrived hot and quickly.  We will definitely be back - maybe for a date night without the kids next time."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I dropped in on Lambretta's fourth day open, and were impressed by the ambiance, the great and prompt service and the delicious food. The portions were reasonable for the price. One thing we didn't like: they up sell a lot (e.g. \"Would you like fresh fettucine for and extra $4?\"). When we got the bill I was surprised that they charged $2 for water. But the fact that my kid ate all of her meal and some of ours, and that it was so kid friendly but still adult-like made it a wonderful, impromptu evening.
 Bonus: Our daughter is hard of hearing and the server knew some sign language!"}
{"text":"Been a half dozen times and vowed to not return after dreadful lunch. Service was initially superb... but once again the food is awful. Caesar salad is boxed croutons and lettuce swimming in tinned dressing. Ugh. Panini sandwich never came near a grill: it's oily eggplant with some kind of cream cheese goo on a cold ciabatta bun I couldn't tolerate and  gobs of oily veggies as 'extras'. These were listed as $2 on menu with a smear beside it (perhaps to read \"ea\"?) and was charged separately at a cost of $7 on top of the regular $14. Server had to consult \"chef\" who reduced the charge a bit in a warning tone \"just this once\". My lunchmate lost it.

Yes, we're paying for the large airy space on Roncey, and yes, it's not a super expensive resto for a holiday lunch, however let's try to have a cook (I refuse to call this person a \"chef\")  whose food is better than what a 12 -y.o. could come up with. I can deal with crap food or overpriced food or attitude after I complain (my fellow diner was similarly appalled & felt ripped off by her stingy 3 ingredient overpriced salad), but not all three at once. This is the 4th time a meal with friends was ruined with Lambretta's distracting shortfalls.  Never again."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here, service was quick and friendly. They do pretty decent Neapolitan style pizza. I had the margarita.. crust was soft and chewy, the fresh mozzarella was good quality. Personally I prefer pizza libretto or pi co, but only by a bit. My only complaint is that the price is a little high which may dissuade me from coming back too often. However if your looking for some decent Neapolitan pizza in Roncesvalles this is a good spot"}
{"text":"We stopped in for s late lunch. We were nearby so we walk over for a bite to eat . We had ordered from the lunch meal. We loved it. We had to have the polenta fingers arugula with aioli dipping sauce. I ordered the High Park pizza with a mushroom purée soup . My wife ordered the Parkside pizza with a Caesar salad. We're so full. We had to take some of our pizza home. Oh well leftovers for tomorrow .
Thank you Lambretta staff for the wonderful lunch."}
{"text":"Good: the crust
Not good: topping ingredients 
Maybe they just had an off night. Interior is cute, service was fine, but the ingredients tasted of poor quality. The ricotta was spongy (not creamy) and roasted red peppers tasted old. My partner didn't enjoy his pizza either. We both thought crust was really good, though!"}
{"text":"Great fancy pizza joint! This place is new on Roncessvalles if I'm not mistaken. My friend and I went here for lunch on our lunch break.

Atmosphere: great deco and not too busy and loud, so this is a great place to bring a friend and catch up. 

Food: my friend and I ordered one white pizza and a red one, Tartufo and their house special the Lambretta. Both were very tasty! The Tartufo pizza is a white pizza with mushrooms, sausage and cheese mmm! The Lambretta is a Margherita pizza topped with fresh arugula and prosciutto. I enjoyed both pizzas and they both tasted fresh. My friend loves the crust and says she likes how it's crispy and not soggy from the sauce. As for me it's no surprise that it was an instant two thumbs up BUT I've tried better.

Service: Great service! Got seated right away, and our server made sure that our glasses were never empty. 

Another great pizzeria in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Don't know if one star is fair. Made reservation tonight. Waited for over twenty minutes after the host said our table was being \"cleaned.\" We were obviously ignored after that. 

Have dined here before. There is better pizza in the city.  Up the street really. Service has always been inconsistent but tonight was ridiculous. What really tooped it off was being yelled at by the the host when I had the apparent gall to leave."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant but ordered the \"lambretta\" pizza; prosciutto is main ingredient..... disappointed to see the pizza only had a TINY few thin pieces of prosciutto on it when it was served. Very stingy. Also my friend ordered the same pizza and also was disappointed with the lack of prosciutto."}
{"text":"Great dinner date, amazing food. Will definitely return!! Only drawback was that it was a little hot inside but that's probably because of the amazing pizza oven"}
{"text":"It's a shame so many people are leaving less than 3 stars. The pizza is amazing and my service was fast. Granted, I'm here for lunch during the week, after the \"lunch rush\" but there's one guy serving the whole place and he's doing a great job (there are still quite a few people here Including a large group and a few families). Anyone complaining about kids being here, that is not a ding against a restaurant (I have no kids and enjoy the money I make not spending it on said kids), it's the nature of the neighbourhood - there are a lot of young Toronto families here so it's certainly not worth bringing down the rating of an otherwise awesome restaurant. I love Neopolitan style pizza and used to live down the street from a Queen Margherita - I've had bad wannabe Neopolitan style pizzas (read: I live in Durham region now) and this is not one of them. Thank you for satiating my desire for some good wine and pizza!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. Got sick all night long because of the dough that was rising inside my stomach!!!
For such a nice place, it's a pity not to know what we're talking about. 
Never turn back.
And will spread the word."}
{"text":"Came here on the long weekend after hanging out by the beach. 

Place is a little small, but I've enjoyed dinner in places smaller. We ordered the pizza, some pasta and dessert. 

The pizza - we got the Lambretta. Was really good. Authentic Italian pizza should and is made the way we got it here. Fresh toppings, with not too much toppings, fresh dough and baked in an authentic stone oven. Was really good, but their not the only place that does it this way. I feel lately that these stone ovens are being used by many restaurants these days, they must be getting cheaper. Either way. Great pizza. 

The pasta - we got the pesto linguine with chicken. Pesto sauce was made fresh, you can tell right from the first mouthful. Great job on not using the bottled stuff. Chicken though was alright, not sure if it was precooked. 

Dessert - Tiramisu and the fried dough balls. Tiramisu was really good, couldn't really taste any alcohol in it, but tasty and authentic nonetheless. The dough balls however were the only lacklustre plate of the afternoon. The dough in the middle was a bit raw, but the mascarpone dip was unnnnnnnreal. I still recommend getting this desert even though mine came out a bit on the raw side (they were really busy). 

I would definitely return here for the pizza and pasta. We're both really good!!"}
