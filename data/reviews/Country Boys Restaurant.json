{"text":"If you are looking for five star dining Country Boys is not the place. If you are looking for a place that makes you feel like you are at home then Country Boys it is! I really enjoy the steak and eggs (and it is a great value, too).  All the servers are great but I always ask for Vicci or Charlie."}
{"text":"I would have to say your guys place was a 3. I didn't expect much out of it, but it was a surprise visit with a friend of mine. Nonetheless it was good. I ordered the waffles with strawberry, and it was nice overall a good experience nothing to crazy, just your breakfast spot with he locals."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. The worst part is the service. Those waitresses are NASTY.  They simply don't care. The prices are creeping up to what other restaurants charge so the savings is Not worth the aggravation. The food is edible--this is the best that I can say about it.  I like to support 24/7 restaurants and so I went for a while. I will not be going back.  The main thing, though, is the rude service that you are forced to contend with. And there are plenty of servers there so it isn't that they are swamped. For the most part, they like to huddle behind the counter and laugh and giggle while you wait.  Try getting a thank you from whoever takes your money at the register--you won't.
I know some have had good experiences here and I would say that I used to about a year ago.  But it has changed significantly.  Denny's has some good food, reasonable prices, you can use coupons, and get stellar service with a smile.
My recommendation is don't go here.  Even if I were to complain to the management--remember--bottom line is They Don't Care!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. Went on a Friday night and there were only 4 other customers there. Seemed dingy and dirty. The booth they sat us at had the stuffing coming out of a huge hole. Menu items are pricy for the quality of food. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Breakfast the way it should be! Fresh, simple and priced for everyday. Crispy fresh hash-browns, they are delicious."}
{"text":"Nothing trendy or cool about Country Boy's, but it's a great spot for a cheap classic breakfast. Look for the super deals posted on the table or ask for a 2 for 1 coupon. It's insanely inexpensive when you do so. The omelettes are delicious, as are most of the combination plates. Classic short order cooking. They also have a good kids menu.

Country Boys is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. You always see a lot of regulars ordering their \"usual\". The fish fry seems popular and they serve special dinners for many of the holidays. We tend to think of the restaurant as a place to go for breakfast any time of day. 

The d√©cor could use an update, as could many of their customers (including me), but it matters not. This is classic comfort food served at a very fair price by very friendly servers. 

There is also a small outdoor seating area, which they will usually open up for you even if they are not serving outside when you arrive. Dogs are allowed on the patio."}
{"text":"Coming here was definitely a last resort. We ended up getting two orders of the \"Super Deals\" that you can find on each table. I ordered \"C\" which included a create your own breakfast combo- two eggs any style, and I chose to get bacon, rather than sausage and ham. The coffee came out first, and from having a first sip, with both creamer and two sugars, it was completely tasteless, and was pretty watered down. I ended up having to add two more sugars, which I typically would never do, just to get some flavor. 
The scrambled eggs were more like a blob of yellow stuff that hardly had any flavor, and looked a lot like the stuff you get premixed in a carton- but the over medium eggs turned out pretty good. The bacon that we ordered, extra crispy, came out super salty, much more than typical bacon, and seemed to be the kind of bacon you get at the store, that is super cheap and contains nearly all fat. 
As for the pancakes we ordered, both buttermilk and chocolate chip, they were the only part of the meal that I really enjoyed. I would definitely recommend them over the bacon & eggs or home fries. 
The service was prompt, and she seemed to be very conscience of all the tables she was taking care of. 
Overall, due to the bland food, but good service, I'm giving this place three stars. The food alone is closer to two stars, but I think the service made for one more."}
{"text":"This place is great & everything a diner should be! Food is delicious & the prices are unbelievable. Vicci is our favorite waitress but everyone there is awesome. I recommend the Chicken fried steak, liver & onions & the kids love the Strawberry pancakes. We go here all the time and although it may not be a very fancy place, the food, service and price ALWAYS hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I can't even give them a star. But because i have to I'll go with one. I was blown away by how rude Vicci and Sabrina were. 

Service- I went in with my little sister (17 yrs old) and her 2 friends and upon seating Vicci already seemed annoyed. I felt like maybe she was thinking \"oh boy a bunch of young people.\" We had two coupons to get a breakfast and get a meal free, so we were just curious (two of us never have been here before) if we could do a breakfast meal and a dinner meal if we wanted to. The way she looked at me was ridiculous for a lady of her age. She made me feel like I was stupid. Then a little bit later she came back to take our order and I just asked if I wanted dinner could I get a breakfast side instead of a dinner side. And she responded by yelling at me \"WHAT KIND OF SIDE?!\" When I simply asked for biscuits and gravy, she said no. Which I don't understand because my friend got biscuits and gravy, and they serve breakfast all day so why wouldn't I be able to just switch my side? Idk. Then, the whole time we were there they (Sabrina and Vicci) stared at us. We weren't being loud. We weren't being disrespectful. It was rude. When we checked out Sabrina was the one who helped us. My friend was asking if she could pay some with cash and the rest on her card and Sabrina answered \"umm...yes?!\" Giving her a look like she couldn't possibly fathom the idea of someone asking that. 

Food- When my sisters friend ordered she asked for a side of ranch. Which she got. When I asked for a side of ranch I was told it was going to be a dollar extra. And was told to share her ranch. What?! Uh ok.. I ordered the French dip. Which was phenomenal. The fries were good too. My friend let me have a bite of her biscuits and gravy, because god forbid I get my own, and it was so cold. I'm glad I didn't get any after all. 

Overall, the food was good. They give you a lot of food for what you pay for. But the service? Shit. I just couldn't believe it. I don't expect to go to a restaurant like this and get 5 star service but if you're in the customer service industry you better work the shit out of your customer service and exceed because that was ridiculous."}
{"text":"All I  know Mickie absolutely rocks she was so awesome with my little boy and the food was outstanding! 5 stars here thank you we will be back"}
{"text":"I went here because I am always looking for some place new, so I purchased their groupon discount ($20 worth of food for $10).

I finally had the opportunity to use my groupon discount and I opted for the steak and shrimp dinner.  The shrimp were bland but otherwise okay, at least they were cooked corectly, but the steak was bland and terrible. I asked for it medium, but it came back well done.  The steak had no seasoning and tasted as if it had been frozen and not fresh.  I should have sent it back, but did not.  There wasn't very many people in the restaurant and it was a good thing, as it appeared that there was only 1 waitress working.

I was going to get dessert, but after the very lackluster dinner I figured the desserts would be just as bad."}
{"text":"Country boys is one of my family's favorite places for good reliable comfort food we are there at least once a week service is good and quick and you cannot beat the prices"}
{"text":"We went here on a restaurant.com coupon. First-don't buy that coupon (another story for another day). The service is very friendly and prompt. However, the food is, well, bland is a compliment. We have gone for both breakfast and dinner. The portions are huge; but there is no flavor. It's pre-processed substance at its best. You can tell everything comes from a can or pre-made for the masses, basic salt and pepper help add flavor to this stuff. And if you don't go on a restaurant.com coupon, it is very cheap. So you want to fill up for a very cheap price, (go drunk and you will love it). [However, with that particular coupon you have to spend way more money to save a few bucks.- did I mention - don't buy restaurant.com coupons?]  If given the choice, stick to Denny's for the food. If you are ok with cheap, bland food and looking for prompt and friendly service, try this place."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to do a review of country boys,
This place is pretty decent, decent food, clean bathrooms, fast and friendly service, anytime I needed service or needed help with anything the couple times I've been there the kitchen staff member named Tod \"British fellow\", Sheldon, or Denise the servers were on top of it."}
{"text":"I have never had a more awful meal in my life. The first thing that hit us when we entered the diner was the overwhelming smell of feces and septic!!! Is was absolutely awful!! They ended up sending one of the kitchen crew with a mop bucket to clean whatever was causing that. Than the food. I ordered chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes, and I never knew it could be so bad. There were huge hard lumps in the potatoes, and it was covered in bacon gravy!! My husband ordered the all you can eat fish, and said it tasted like it was very old and microwaved. One of my daughters ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and when I was trying to taste her meatball, it was all I could do not to gag. The noodles were yellow and hard,and the sauce was mixed with about a half a cup of water that was standing on the plate. All I can say is thank God for the Little Ceasars nearby so that we could feed our kids on the way home. Also, horrible service! It wasnt busy at all, and it took forever to get our drinks and what not. This place was an epic fail."}
{"text":"Chicken strips are a little weird but the strawberry desert thing they have was pretty amazing. Might have to do with the fact we came in blazed. Great that it's open 24 hours though."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there around 9:15a this morning.
We we're greeted and taken to a booth of our choice.
After about a minute or two the waitress came over to take our drink order.
Me: Do you have a kids menu?
Waitress: Yes we do
Me: Can I see it?
Waitress: Yes you can but you can't order off of it
Me: So you are telling me I cannot order off the kids menu
Waitress: Yes
Me talking to my husband: Let's go to Denny's
Waitress: Ummm, ok

We are now at Denny's. We we're greeted and taken to a booth quickly.
Waitress greeted us and asked if we would like something to drink.
Me: Can I see the Kids menu?
Waitress: Sure, let me get that for you.

I had no problem ordering off the kids menu while at Denny's.

I may be an adult but I am an adult who had the gastric sleeve done. I do not eat that much and I do not want to waste money on adult meal when I cannot finish it.

Country Boys, there should be NO REASON why an adult cannot order off the kids menu. You still have a customer and you are making that customer happy.
What ever happened to \"Customer comes 1st\"?

You lost a customer today."}
{"text":"This place seemed like a typical diner but beware, it was not.

The cups were dirty (old lipstick) and my side of peaches came with a moldy piece the waitress, Pam, tried to convince me was a 'mushroom'.

After a disgusting experience, at no point did the manager come over or the waitress apologize.

I would not recommend this place to anyone and if I could rate below one star, I would."}
{"text":"This is diner food, good diner food!  Good food at great prices are a combination hard to find in Phoenix.  All breakfast's are $6.99.  I happen to really enjoy corn beef and sunny side eggs with hash browns, it's my go to breakfast.  Always order it with rye bread toast and coffee.  Coffee isn't Starbucks but it is good for what it is, a nice hot brew.  Service is excellent, the waitress' are very attentive and your coffee cup will stay filled.  Food is served hot and fresh, even though I know it's canned corn beef hash, but it is cooked to a crispy texture, just like the generous portion of hash browns.  If your not a food snob and want to enjoy a good hot breakfast, then join the deplorable's at Country Boy's for breakfast."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy and it took a while to place our order.  Our server was friendly and kept our coffee full!  The food was good!  The waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The atmosphere is very casual and the d√©cor is a bit outdated.  Overall, we would eat here again and they are open 24/7!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Been there multiple times never had a bad experience breakfast sandwich was great and the cowboy omelette was fantastic."}
{"text":"Total trash. Horrible service. Garbage tasting food. Don't try to use a Groupon here, they'll just up the prices. Literally, I'd be more inclined to tell you to eat your own feces, it'll taste better"}
{"text":"Updated 11/21/2015- country boys had a significant price increase and change to their breakfast specials. Since we moved to the east valley we would still make the journey here for their amazingly prices breakfast but this price increase is quite substantial. I don't think we'll be coming as much."}
{"text":"Describe the food in two words: Gross, unhealthy. No fruit, yogurt or any healthy alternative offered. Just lard or oil soaked bland garbage. Never again!"}
{"text":"Better than dennys by far. Flo at the helm!"}
{"text":"The only saving grace was our server, she was lovely and tried her best to make a terrible situation better.

I ordered the Country Boy Breakfast, the plate of meat made my stomach turn. The sausage looked like two dried up terds. The bacon was black, not burnt, black! It looked like it had sitting in old grease. When I brought it to our servers attention she agreed and took it back. She went into the kitchen to fish out the best looking pieces of bacon, and it wasn't much of an improvement. She said they cook all the meat in the morning. They advertise breakfast 24 hrs a day. Should say salmonella 24hrs a day."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! 2.99 breakfast (pssst-not small portions! Owner is usually there. The cooks are great especially the overnight cook-Kim. ALL the staff is very friendly. It's a small town feel and they remember you when you come back. I'm a regular there at least 4 days a week"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here around noon today for breakfast.  We walked in, were greeted, and shown rather indifferently to our booth (which felt more like a plank of wood with some plastic over it, as I suspect it was).  Our waitress was quick to take our drink order and quick to bring the drinks; unfortunately, she also expected us to know what we wanted just as quickly.  I said we'd need another minute and she turned around without a word and stalked away.  When she finally did return 10 minutes later, she came right up to the table and just looked at us expectantly, still saying nothing.  We gave our orders and she rattled off our bread choices so fast I could hardly catch them.  I mean it was SO obvious she didn't want to be there, didn't want us there, and at that point WE didn't want to be there anymore, either.  It took far longer than it should have for our breakfasts to come out, considering they were obviously frozen and just warmed up in the stove.  When the waitress brought our food (WITH the check, I might add, as though to say, \"hurry up and get the hell out\"), we informed her that we had no place settings.  She sighed audibly and grabbed a set from the next table.  She checked on us just once more during the rest of the meal, never offered refills, and it was a different waitress entirely who took our plates away.  When it came time to pay, we asked for the coupons that they always USED to give out with your meal.  The lady who took our plates seemed confused and got our original waitress, who came back, smelling of cigarettes, and just stared at us, asking what we needed.  My boyfriend explained about the coupons, and she said they only give them out AFTER you've paid.  We know for a fact it didn't used to be that way, but whatever.  So we asked if we could split the check between our two cards, and again she stared at us, confused, asking what we were wanting to do.  He explained again that we wanted to put half the check on my card and half on his, and she said, \"So do you just want me to split the check?\"  Uh, YEAH.  That's what we've been telling you.  She came back with our respective receipts, pinning them down with a sort of barely-contained rage as they tried to roll away, and explained which copies needed to be signed.  We're not stupid lady, but thanks anyway.

The food itself was bland and probably a notch below Denny's.  Now my boyfriend has a terribly upset stomach and I feel.....weird.  NEVER EVER going back to that place.  EVER."}
{"text":"Country Boys Restaurant is one of the few 24-Hour places open in Scottsdale.  It's in the shadow of McDonald's and a few Mexican restaurants but offers the classic diner experience.  I found the staff extremely helpful and friendly.  They have a great breakfast special.

They would have received 5 Stars, but their Wifi wasn't working (I'm not sure if they offer that).  I'm often working on my phone or laptop, so high-speed internet is important for me."}
{"text":"Our server was jay , she liked me until I order another meal . I order the  ground beef skillet with over easy eggs and it was burnt and had absolutely no flavored , the potatoes was undesirable. So I replaced it with the chicken, it look like van de camp fish fillets and it was salty . I lost my appetite overall , all my children did was complain . The food tasted like microwave boxed meat , the name and the groupon draw me in . My husband got steak and mash potatoes, smelled like a banquet dinner from the microwave. Our first time visiting Arizona and this is not what I expected, I will never go there again . Btw the bathroom was clean but smelled like mold"}
{"text":"I have a location near me on 35th Avenue. Everyone of their locations that I have been to, around the Phoenix, AZ area, is reasonably priced with good service and good food. I go there when I am hungry and nothing else is open. Breakfast is my favorite meal and they serve that 24/7."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood cafe. Late nights or early mornings, using the 2 for 1 coupons make this place a great deal. The waitresses are friendly and can recommend anything off their menu. Try the Sweet Tea. Makes you think your down South."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.  Country Boys is exactly what Gino's Coast to Coast should have been.  I Thought it would be ghetto due to the name, location, and coupons for $3 breakfast but it was very clean and bright inside and the waitress was very nice and professional.  The food was very good and the breakfast menu had everything you could want and even better they serve it 24/7.  It has a diner type feel, I felt like it could be my usual place, like Monks coffee shop on Seinfeld.  I look foreward to trying their lunch, dinner and desserts."}
{"text":"Pretty good food somewhat clean bathrooms, price is right. Especially the table top specials."}
{"text":"I had only been to this establishment with friends late at night and under the influence. I decided to come during normal hours and at dinner time with sobriety. The service is slow but when there are only 2 people to serve the whole restaurant, both of which are probably well within retirement age, speed isn't a request that is easily accommodated. 

The food was average at best. Normal unseasoned American fare with a small twist: diner style food with restaurant atmosphere. 

Vicci was pleasant, much like visiting your friends grandma. I food appreciate the prices which match the food and service. It's true you get what you pay for. 

I'll stick to coming after hours with friends and intoxication."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner at The Country Boy's Restaurant on Greenway Road in Phoenix. It was my first visit, but I went there with my parents, who had been there twice before for breakfast. They raved about the place, the food, and the prices, so we decided to give them a go for dinner.

I had a classic BLT, and my parents split a meatloaf dinner. It was enough for the two of them, and my sandwich was plenty for me (along with really good french fries). We had a coupon for \"2 for 1\" dinner, and ended up leaving the place satisfied, and under budget (about $20 for the three of us). 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good cheap food. The only negative is their menu, which offers a lot of items, but not all sounded good to me. I think they would do better with a standard menu, less items, and more solid choices, but that is just me.

Overall, with the coupon, I would definitely visit again, though probably for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Visited the CB's at 32nd St & Greenway this morning, we have always loved the food and service at the CB'S at 23rd Ave and Camelback and decided to take advantage of the Groupon. Well it seemed like as soon as the waitress saw the Groupon on my phone she didn't care about service or getting our food to the table even Luke warm. both chicken fried steaks  and eggs. gravy, meat and potatoes were cold. we never saw her for her to ask about our meal she was more interested in chatting at the front counter. what a shame because we are moving right down the street. we didn't even take their coupons offered."}
{"text":"Waitress was very prompt and friendly. Service was good, food not so much. The food was was you'd expect from a chain restaurant. Probably buy white sauce in 55 gal drums. A lot of folks seemed pleased with the food, but maybe because the prices were low."}
{"text":"Great spot and Great breakfast food. Above average in this category of restaurant (Denny's).  Had Bacon omelet with pancakes, and biscuits w/gravy. All were very tasty and came out quick. Tip: Share a meal...so much food. Awesome service - ask for Tina. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Going to be real simple. .i have lived in the area 4years..and one night i went on a walk and wandered in here.. and yeah..wasn't expecting much..but the food was bland..and eh

But hey for a cheap breakfast why not huh? Comparable to an independent dennys"}
{"text":"This is not the worst place that you could go. Maybe not the best for sure. But, they do have good breakfast. The staff works very hard here. You have to give them points for that.
The price is low, so no complaining there. Endless coffee another plus.
Not a bad place we would go back for sure. I have only had the Breakfast there and I like it. Plus, it is a chain. Besides it is 24 hours a day so that is another nice thing."}
{"text":"I was going here off and on for about a year. Nice people, I mean really nice people, BUT, there's always a but...The food-I would usually get pancakes and eggs, always awesome. And my dining companion would get the roast beef sandwich, which she loves. But every time I would get a sandwich- burger or club, no bueno. I've never finished an entire sandwich it has not been good. The bread on the bottom has ALWAYS been soggy aka- WET. And the chicken in the chicken club I did not eat, it tasted funky. The waitress offered to replace the sandwich, remember these are very nice people but I declined by then I had enough because when she asked me there was a fly on my plate and flies are biggest problem here. THERE ARE ALWAYS FLIES! Flying around, landing on me, my friend AND ON OUR FOOD!!! Don't sit in the row of banquets closest to the far window there are more flies near that window. It's probably the warmth from the sunlight. But whatever, I do not understand, a place that appears to be clean ALWAYS having flies. There is something somewhere in that restaurant that needs to be cleaned, the drains?! I have never dined in a place ANYWHERE in this country that had a problem w/ flies like this ever. They are aware of the problem because the AC is on HIGH, the place is chilly. Flies don't like the cold....No I won't be back, despite the nice people and despite the great 2-4-1 coupon specials that they run daily. Flies?! No excuse. You all have a good day-"}
{"text":"Always a great place to visit. Attentive and friendly staff,  great prices and delicious food. My personal recommendations are the biscuits and gravy, as well as the \"ham off the bone\""}
{"text":"Decided to give this diner a try, no it's not your a typical chic breakfast spot serving organic eggs but this little diner does serve a fresh breakfast amongst other items in a quick manner. We came here this past Sunday during the late morning, no waiting to be sat although they were full but there weren't any employees standing around either. My hubby got your typical breakfast of eggs, bacon, hash browns & toast. He was completely satisfied with zero complaints. I went with a BLT on rye toast served with fries, not much to mess up with that order & everything was served fine. Our server Pam was there for us when need be without being there too much. Would we go back, definitely........we got fast service with fresh food & zero wait on a Sunday morning!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the service is always fast and friendly. The portions are very generous and for the times when its late night nothing beats it. Often times they also have great 2 for 1 specials that cant be beat. Why go to fast food when you can get two meals for the same price !"}
{"text":"I have eaten here for 3 years now.  It use to be a hit or miss on the food but now I just order 1 thing.   The breakfast special.  Its 3 bucks for eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns.  And they have good hashbrowns.  They are about 3/4 of an inch thick and crispy on the outside.  The inside if fully cooked but a little softer.  I add pancakes sometimes for like $1 or $2.  Which is a good deal.  Also, I can bring my dog out on the patio when it is nice outside.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the place is pretty run down.  Everything there is old.  Very very very old.  But the food is good and I usually get a friendly server.  P.S. I liked the chicken fried steak"}
{"text":"This place is great, the waitress Jessica aka Jay is AWESOME. Such a nice person and very helpful! Will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when looking to turn around to go to someplace more familiar.  Decided to eat there just to shake things up.  I was not disappointed.  Country Boys on Greenway is a smallish 24-hour diner and their menu is typical diner fare.  My party experienced breakfast, so no comment, yet, on other meal offerings.  Caveat: I was looking to dine out cheap.

We took some time to peruse the menu and made our decisions.  Notably, our server asked us if we had any coupons, which we did not.  We voiced our lament, me more so (remember, my goal was to eat cheap?)  She proffered to take our order and determine if there were any options that would save us money.  Cool!  I liked this place already.  Once she knew what we wanted, she had suggestions for us that saved a few bucks for my dining partner and shaved 1/2 off the cost of my meal.  The concessions from our original menu choices to gain those savings were minimal.  I hadn't taken a bite and I was already happy to be there.

Our meal was served quite quickly, almost too quickly.  I had ordered pancakes as a side and I know they are typically made from premixed ingredients.  Note: I don't like restaurant pancakes.  Grandma taught me how to make them and restaurant pancakes are no substitute.  However, I occasionally try the pancakes at a new place to use my relative level of dissatisfaction as a gauge of the overall quality.  It's a tough measuring tool, but it works for me.  

Overall, the meal was quite satisfactory.  I was not expecting innovation or dining nirvana from a 24-hour diner and I did not experience either.  I did receive my food promptly, hot, and in quantities sufficient to satisfy.  It met and, in the case of the pancakes, slightly exceeded my expectations.  The bacon, in particular, was perfectly cooked, thick cut, and quite tasty.  Home style potatoes were very good with none of the onions or other crap restaurants add to try to make them special.  The eggs were perfectly cooked to order - I can't tell you how many times I've differed with cooks regarding the definition of \"Over-Medium\".  

Overall, I give Country Boys a rating of 4 stars.  Fine dining it is not.  Good quality diner fair, with friendly and knowledgeable service?  Absolutely.  Oh, they have a drive-through too.  That's just icing."}
{"text":"I found this place on Groupon and what a great find. It is nothing fancy but it reminds me of the diners we have back in the Northeast.
The service is fast and friendly and the food is really good. The portion sizes are pretty big.
They also give out coupons so it makes it very affordable to eat here ."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Can you say nasty? Denny's is a 5 star compared to this place, let's start by my mom almost falling off the booth chair because it was broken. Changes booths. Place is pretty old, not vintage.... OLD! Staff was very nice. No wait for a Saturday morning, Red Flag! Let's talk about the food, we had a couple of bites and decided to walk! It tasted like it was yesterday's left overs they warmed up. Eggs and hash browns had no salt. As I got up I almost fell, I guess all the booths are broken. Again the staff was great. My recommendations is you run ? not walk.... away!"}
{"text":"It is what it is. 24 hour food. Saw the server do things she never should have: touch my food with her hands, touch my food with another plate. Handle money then food without washing her hands. And that's just what I saw. I would only eat here in a pinch  (you know, like 3am when nothing else is open and eating at home isn't an option. At least it tasted okay.  P.S. side items that are fruit are canned fruit in syrup. Meh."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the new family diner here in the north part of Paradise Valley.  Country Boys offers an array of breakfast, lunch and dinner fare at inexpensive prices.  In addition, it is open twenty four hours which is rare as chicken lips in Phoenix.  

I had the traditional steak and eggs, my colleague (e.g. six year old son) had the pancakes and chicken fingers.  The food was cooked just right and was presented warm.  I felt that the seasoning left something to be desired (hence it missed a four star rating).  The coffee is diner quality which I enjoy and the waitress was friendly.

One important note, the bathrooms ARE clean.  I normally would not mention it, but since it is a 24 hours restaurant, a clean bathroom says a lot about the quality and care of the management.

I recommend."}
{"text":"So we came back again...we seen Samantha but she was in another station so we had Denise. Just as wonderful, very attentive and informative. Food is excellent, hot and kitchen & dining room clean. Can't wait for my next visit to Phoenix"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  This place is so unwelcoming.  Hand written signs everywhere about what they don't accept.  Everything is pre made, horrible biscuits and gravy.  The sausage was surely frozen before they cooked it, as it was like chewing on rubber.  They also advertise a drive thru, but they do not have one.  Pretty bummed about this one."}
{"text":"This was the first time here and WOW where we taken aback!!!!  The food was beyond great and over flowing on the plate and the price was better than any restaurant around, even without the 2 4 1 coupon!!!  The waitress (Tina) was awesome!!!  and they Definitely need to keep the COOK!!!  Kudo's to the restaurant to have her AND the cook!!  I ordered the corned beef hash and I like it crispy and they made it crispy....I order it that way at any other restaurant and they can not get it right, but here they do!!!!!  They do need to update the decor, stuck in the 70's era, hence the 4 stars.  We will be back again decor or not.  Have not done the dinner menu, but I'm sure we will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast. They have an assortment  of breakfast combos that are VERY inexpensive.  I personally like the biscuits and gravy! 
This is a restaurant  that has a 'country feel ' to it.
The service is wonderful.  
Take a break from Dennys and Ihop. Check it out!"}
{"text":"HAIR IN FOOD gag - The 1st time we went to this place right after it opened, it seemed like a good deal for just above average food. The 2nd time. . . GAG!! Everything seemed dingy and dirty - the plants in the windows, the silverware, the glasses. Everything was coated with oily residue and dust. Then my daughter lifted up her fork and gasped and we were all mortified to see a long hair entangled in her food. We weren't compensated like any other restaurant would have done.  I took a better look at the cooks and kitchen as we left and felt my stomach turn. We will never return to this disgusting place. I'm surprised the health department hasn't had at them yet."}
{"text":"**See note about prices below***
 We come here often now, and the prices are great. Specially for morning people, (which I am not) they have early specials for like $3-$4 for breakfast.

I try to do keto/low carb and they have great breakfast options at very reasonable prices. They always have the BOGO coupon on their website.

Blanca and Ramses have taken great care of us, although everyone has been good too.

The kitchen is not very consistent with portions and presentation, but for the prices they charge we give them a lot of leeway.

We have used restaurant.com certificates and did not have any issues.
I noticed some reviews indicating this restaurant charges more if you have a coupon. And throughout our visit it was clearly explained in multiple places: They have the menu prices, and other specials that do not apply if you do have a coupon.
This means that, if you have a coupon you need to let your server know prior to ordering so they know how to charge each item (regular menu price).

An omelette may be $10 or $11 in the menu, but as part of the specials they offer you may be able to order it for $6.99 if you do not use a coupon. (Note: As of March 2018 they no longer have the $6.99, $7.99 and $8.99 specials, but still a good deal) So it is either, or: specials, or coupons/other discounts. Not too hard to grasp.."}
{"text":"Hash browns, eggs over medium, home fries...Very delicious. Service was very friendly. Prices are very affordable. Be sure to check out the Yelp offer when checking in for $5 off.  I'll be back for Sure."}
{"text":"A small little breakfast joint. Service is so-so. The food is ok. I think for what you get it could be a little cheaper."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place and come probably once or twice a month. Obviously it's not the fanciest place but who cares. Rarely a wait and food is cheap and good! I always get an omelette with rye toast and it's fantastic. My boyfriend changes it up and has tried several different items and he's always been happy with his meal. They also always have some sort of coupon available which makes it that much better!"}
{"text":"They have great service I enjoy the breakfasts and its clean and priced right. I dont care much for the rest due to the lack of flavor. There is a lot of older folks dining so maybe that is why the flavor is lacking.  But I still will eat here cuz they have great deals and tasty breakfasts."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Makes me think of Dennys with another name. Should be closed down for being boring and serving crappy bacon."}
{"text":"I heard that this location was bought and they have different owners than other locations, this could be very important. Being that this was such a disappointing couple of meals...
    I've had two completely different experiences here in two weeks. So I changed my first rating from a 4 to a 2. How I came up with that rating was I averaged it between my two visits of a 4 rating and a 0 rating. 
  About my zero rating:
(1) Horrible service!  The server was in a fight with her sister and brought it to work with her in every way possible. Just the look on her face would send most patrons running for another seat or even restaurant. 
(2) The Kitchen must not have a screen door, it was like an outdoor picnic in there.  There were more flies inside than specks of sausage in my biscuits and gravy. 
(3) They use dinner rolls, not biscuits. The two specks of sausage were cut from a patty, not even ground sausage.. I'm not kidding two small pieces of sausage on my whole plate!!! 
(4) I HAD TO ASK FOR A REFILL OF COFFEE 3 TIMES. 
(5) And lastly the entire experience as a whole was extremely poor. 
  On my first trip to Country Boys I had such great service I probably didn't notice the food as much, maybe it's a distraction trick they've learned or a jedi mind trick,  but I couldn't complain.  The portions were a good size, the prices were great, and the service was excellent.
After my last experience, I definitely wouldn't go back to this place!!! 
."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Not sure why anyone would rave about this place. Pancakes were rubbery, 3 cheese omelet uses kraft slices and lacks any taste/flavor. Biscuits and gravy were awful and coffee tastes like it's a week old and reheated. In addition to the horrible food, the atmosphere is just sad and gloomy. I will definitely never go to this place again."}
{"text":"The food here is good, and the value is awesome. The $2.99 breakfast specials can only be beat by their BOGO Free coupons available on their website. The hash brown were perfect and my husband said the pancakes were good too. While we were eating the manager even came by to check on us. They are open 24 hours so stop by and pay them a visit."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for quite a while.  Always came past midnight and things were pretty quiet.  One server and one cook were plenty.  

At 1:30am today there were 10 or so people and Uber Eats being ordered throughout.  The food was the same late night breakfast.  But... Staffing levels don't match the volume of business.  Service was slower than it would be, but staff had orders coming in, Uber drivers arriving, people wanting to order, people wanting to pay, all at once. 

Sheldon, the server and the cook were pretty calm and organized throughout, but I could see they were a bit stretched.  

I hope owners don't ignore that they need another person to tend to Uber Eats and help with drinks /cashiering with the rise in volume late nights, at least on the weekends.  I have no complaints about staff, they worked hard."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice for breakfast and we loved it!! The country omelette and the breakfast sandwich are delicious. We decided to try the Original Breakfast house today and it was horrible food compared to here. We will stick with Country Boys from now on."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would. I was sucked into this place by a Groupon I couldn't pass up. $20 bucks worth of food for $5. Ya know how some things are too good to be true? Well, this would be one of those. If they have to give away promo's like that, something is wrong. I should have known that! Me and the kiddo went this past Saturday for lunch since we were in the area. The sign said wait to be seated, several waitresses made eye contact and did not acknowledge us. I noticed right when walking in how tacky old and semi dirty it was. Ghetto, with a capital G. Given that I had already paid the money for the groupon, I wasn't going to waste my money. The waitress was extremely cold, no personality, looked irritated being at work. Having been in the restaurant industry for several years, I know better than to ever act like that to a customer. Especially given that your job is mainly paid with in tips!!! We both got the bacon cheeseburger with frys and ranch. The food was just okay. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, even with the groupon. Its worth the extra few bucks to stick with Dennys."}
{"text":"We moved to this area from central Phoenix over a year ago and like to support local businesses rather than chains. We decided to try it around  11 am today and were hugely disappointed.  The table we saw being cleaned was still dirty so it was re-cleaned when we asked. Ordered water with coffee and OJ. One of the waters had things floating in it. When I told the waitress it had a little something extra in it, she joked and said at least she didn't charge me for it. If she had removed the glass and replaced it with fresh, that would have been great. She didn't. Just left it on the  table with no replacement. Husbands breakfast burrito was so so with tons of potatoes (with potatoes on the side) and hardly any of the 3 meats that were supposed to be in it. My French toast was inedible and tastes like it had been deep fried.  I ate one of my scrambled eggs and the bacon.  Fastest and most disappointing breakfast we have ever had. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is an old school diner greasy spoon kind of place.  I like coming here just for that reason.  They give out coupons and everyone seems to have some sort of discount.  The food is standard diner type stuff and doesn't disappoint.  Servers are friendly and even if you don't have a coupon, prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Family and I go here every Sunday after church (mainly because we always have a BOGO coupon lol) and it's great every time. Savannah, our favorite waitress, is a sweetheart, she's memorized our drink orders and brings them out when she sees us walk in. 
Not the prettiest place but I come for the food not the curtains and mismatching  chairs. 
Service is pretty consistent, they may forget something you've asked for but I understand because we come when it's a full house.
Food is good, nothing fancy but I've never had a complaint. 
Overall, I think it's good otherwise why would my family and I come back every week?"}
{"text":"My husband and I my daughter went out for breakfast Sunday the worst experience ever my eggs were overdone my daughter's age with burnt my husband's skillet was raunchy $35 and we didn't even eat our breakfast"}
{"text":"Just sat for 10 minutes without even a greeting from a server. When I sat down I thought \"boy does this feel like home!\" 10 minutes later as I left I thought \"boy am I hungry!\""}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go out to breakfast on Sunday, March 5th. We like Country Boys and since it has been awhile, we thought we would eat there. Upon arriving at the restaurant, we discovered other people decided the same thing too. We were able to find a parking spot amongst many other customers cars.

There was a 5 minute wait to be seated as there were 3 parties ahead of us waiting to be shown to their tables as more customers left. While waiting in line we looked at their specials for breakfast and lunch they have posted right where people walk in.

We were seated and given menus. Our waitress took our drink order. We ordered coffee and ice water. She returned quickly with our coffee and water. After we perused the menu, we placed our order. 
My husband ordered the Po Boys scramble with shredded pork, vegetables, cheese and home fried potatoes. I ordered the strawberry stuffed french toast. It was stuffed with cream cheese and loaded down with strawberries. I didn't need syrup and I liked that. Every bite of our food was delicious. In fact, we were so busy eating that I forgot to take photos! But even then the photos would not have done the french toast-justice. My kudos's to the cooks in the kitchen. I ordered home fries on the side to go with my strawberry stuffed french toast. 
Our waitress was fabulous. She was very attentive, checked on us often, and refilled our coffee. She restocked our cream and sugar as well. Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention and get her name :(
On another note: their restrooms are clean and tidy. Very important because it speaks volumes about the cleanliness of the restaurant. The restaurant is clean as well. The employees are nice, friendly and efficient. We will return at a future date."}
{"text":"My wife and I love country boys! We Yale the kids and get their great breakfast specials anytime of day or week. They are consistent in quality of home cooked food. Nothing from a bag in that kitchen. Simple, good eats for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Walking in reminds me of a 5 & Dinner which I enjoy! I figured the food wouldn't be homemade just by judgments on the old looks (although I liked the old look, I enjoyed it!) okay! So the food came out first the chili cheese fries  (I am a big fry lover) and they were fresh! Wonderful! And tasty! Loved it!! We both had an omelet with biscuits and gravy and the biscuits and gravy are AMAZING, OH SO AMAZING. Don't judge this place by its looks, sit down and taste the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Living in the area for years, and originally seeing this place that replaced the Kyoto Bowl that was there for years, expecting this \"Open 24-Hour\" to be the ultimate alternative to going to the crappy Denny's, I was honestly disappointed when my family and i went to this location.

For a place that is supposed to center around \"southern\" coking, they completely failed in area 3 essential areas, as their Chicken fried Steak, their biscuits, and their country gravy were three oof the most either disgusting or disappointingly bland things I have ever ingested in my life. The water the biscuits and gravy were made with tasted like chlorine. There was no chance in Hell that the Chicken fried Steak was battered fresh at that location. 

Also, service was incredibly sub-par...took forever to get server's attention, even when walking up TO the front. NOT kid friendly...or at least they weren't the one time i went there. Easily annoyed by parties with toddlers.

I don't usually recommend Denny's over ANYTHING, but when I do, it's because my dining experience is as awful as this. Go to Denny's if your drunk and that prohibits you from traveling too far out of this area at 2 in the morning. Even the crap at Denny's is worth the mile walk instead of this brutal slop."}
{"text":"World's Okayest Breakfast spot.  

Was really hopeful for some good biscuits and gravy, but was disappointed.  

Hash browns were only okay, could use butter instead of oil for better flavor. 

Coffee kind of tasted burnt."}
{"text":"First time breakfast here, food was good for the price, coffee is weak and could be stronger. Good value for the money, especially with a coupon, always in the Arizona republic newspaper. Pancakes were good, very clean, service was fast at the counter seating. Fairly busy this morning, about 3/4 full, but no waiting."}
{"text":"don't eat her

unless you want to get sick

this place has really gone down hill"}
{"text":"This place is great! The prices are amazing, the food is delicious and it's a great place to have breakfast for any sort of occasion! I've came here hungover from a night of drinking with friends, had a cheap but very filling breakfast from this place and I knew the rest of my day was going to be a good one!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I live over 15 minutes from Country Boys and my delivery is always hot, fresh, and delicious! The menu is so diverse and I am very grateful to be able to get such great food at any hour! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be my breakfast spot I came in 4 times a week throughout high school, 3-4 nights a week after high school, and have been a customer for 8 years. I'm not the kind of guy that complains usually I always tip and am always respectful but my visit this morning I received no respect from this place. I walked in took a seat with my wife and child and ordered two steak and eggs the steaks were ordered medium and were well done not just tough but cooked all the way through and past the point of return the waitress walked past us twice and didn't say anything. When she said something after my entire plate was finished I said the steak was way over cooked to which she responded can I get you something else. I appreciated her asking me if she could replace the steak however when my next steak came out it was blue rare; again not just red or pink it was blood red throughout the entire steak. I decided it wasn't worth trying to order something else because I'd already been here for an hour plus the waitress took me up to pay didn't even apologize and asked for the full ticket price I paid it. She didn't even give me a receipt so I asked for one to which she responded if you wanted to eat than you shouldn't have ordered steak. Are kidding me!!! If I wanted to eat I come in an order food and eat I'm a customer I can't control the cook I simply order food and pay you. They apparently don't want my business because I won't put up with trashy service and snide remarks I'll be talking to a manager for a refund on Monday because this was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Meh.

My husband and I were seeking a super cheap and filling breakfast when we stumbled upon a Hungry Boy's 2 for 1 coupon. How can you beat that?

The layout and building is very strange. I think it used to be a tokyo express or something. Tables are cramped.

Service was fast, friendly, and efficient. My coffee was always filled as soon as it was empty.

Unfortunately the coffee sucked and so did the food. The coffee tasted like water and I did not get any sort of a caffeine buzz from it. 

The food wasn't terrible tasting but it didn't have any taste to it whatsoever. My husband had the basic egg, hash browns and bacon breakfast. He wasn't impressed. I had the veggie omelet with home fries. The veggies in the omelet consisted of bell pepper, tomato, mushrooms, and onions (which I omitted). Really I think these are the only veggies they probably have in the whole restaurant besides iceberg lettuce. It is that sort of place. Even Denny's has a better veggie selection. I like how they described the mushrooms on the menu as \"tender\". Haha. That is because they were canned. The omelet had waaay too much cheese in it. I had to pull some out to avoid choking. The home fries had absolutely no flavor. 

I did like the wide variety of sides to go with your breakfast. I chose the french toast. Again it had no flavor. And the syrup was watery! Like the coffee.

I never thought I would say this sentence ever in my life but... Denny's is better. I think that (just like the Olive Garden and other mediocre chain restaurants) people who frequent places like this prefer quantity over quality. They are satisfied with overly processed and bland foods. As long as they are supersized."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast with my husband on a weekday. The I ordered an egg and cheese omelet. He got some pancakes and eggs. Coffee was fine. When my omelet arrived, it was not really an omelet as I expected, but more like eggs that were scrambled, thrown on the flat top, then rolled up with some american cheese inside. There was a huge, long hair on my plate. When I told the waitress, she acted like I was inconveniencing her. She didn't say sorry or let me get you a new one, she just grabbed my plate and left. Soon she dropped another omelet on my table. The food wasn't great. It just wasn't worth it. Bad service and not so good food. Denny's and IHOP are better than this place."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch with a group on 3/13/18.  Great place for good food at an affordable price.

Since I love breakfast I had the Denver omelet.  It comes with hash browns and a side.  I picked applesauce for my side.  I asked for the hash browns well or crisp on both side and that is how they came out.  Yum.  The omelet was gigantic and very good.  I had to take half home.  When I asked for Cholula sauce the server brought it over immediately and even asked if I would like to try the green Cholula which she brought also.  I will stick to the red but I thought that was nice of her to suggest.

There were 15 of us and our server Blanca was fantastic.  She got out orders out correctly and was very efficient.  We didn't have to search for her to get coffee refills or anything else.  There was another server with short red hair who helped Blanca and she was great also.

Good food and at a great price and open 24 hours.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here last Thursday. I had the spinach, tomato scramble with crispy hash browns. My friend had the Biscuits' and grave with scrambled eggs, sausage and hash browns. Wow it was great and filling. I had a Groupon and they gladly accepted it. Friday we had wonderful leftovers for breakfast so we really got our moneys worth. Just down the street so I will be back."}
{"text":"We go for breakfast at dinner time. Never tried anything but their breakfasts. They are friendly- helpful. I go with 3 friends in wheelchairs and they handle us, no problem.
  The breakfast that we order- are huge and delish. We go once a month and will always. Thanks :)"}
{"text":"I do not recommend eating here. Waitress brought me moldy dinner rolls, their bagged salad was starting to wilt ,the food is bland, and the some of the waitresses suffer from a serious case of resting b*tch face. No wonder the have such cheap deals."}
{"text":"Yuck! Heard great things, went for breakfast. It's busy on Sunday mornings, I get it, but my biscuit was burnt black and omelet that asked for with out peppers came w peppers and left out mushrooms. Waster totally blamed me- I was sitting at the \"bar\" and heard her tell the cooks and the people beside me heard me order. They commented that she was wrong and my order was totally messed up but to try it again another day- as I sat w an empty coffee cup most of the meal. Second time went late night w a couple friends and none of us liked what we ordered. We didn't complain, expect for hair in one meal- and won't go back. Would have been better off hitting a drive thru. Don't believe the hype!"}
{"text":"35th and cactus location... Went here for Father's day prime rib advertised in a mailer.  First they wouldn't honor the price on the flyer until I showed it to them and then they claimed it was a misprint.  The waitress was rude and the food was AWFUL.  PRIME rib tasted like an overcooked pork chop! Granted, we didn't expect it to be restaurant quality at $21.99 for 2, but it could've at least tasted like beef! A total waste of money...  Will never go back even for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is your typical diner. A place you'd expect to dine at off a remote exit during a road trip. I want to start with bad first. Service isn't bad, but it's not great, they are attentive but have no problem gossiping in front of guests. Again, what you kind of expect at a place like this. It's almost cliche but they don't try. They have a pretty open kitchen and what's disappointing is the heavy use of microwaves. Even when not necessary. If they make their biscuits in house that means they have an oven, and biscuits should be picked up in the oven, not the microwave. 
Also you can watch the servers grab lemons with bare hands and throw them in drinks. So just order a water without lemon. 
Now the good things. The value is unbeatable. The value combos, and breakfast specials make up for the use of a microwave. You can get fresh cooked to order egg, and a side, hashbrowns, tomatoes, peaches etc for justl 3.79, after tax. That's less expensive than a fast food restaurant and you get served, have a clean restaurant with clean restrooms. 
If you're smart and really check out the menu you can get yourself some good deals. On the menu its 8.49 for eggs, biscuits, and sausage but if you do the breakfast combo for 3.49, add biscuits and gravy for .75 more, that's 4.25, and add 1.39 for meat, that's a total of 5.64 for the same.
Been there several times now and always the same experience and I will be continuing to go there. Again, not your hipster breakfast joint that have become popular, this is an old school breakfast diner. I can usually get in and out in about 15 minutes and a full bellies."}
{"text":"I had breakfast today for the second time in a week at this great place!!  Both times, I ordered the chicken fried steak, which comes with hash browns or home fries, two eggs and your toast selection.  I am pretty finicky about breakfast and like everything just so.  Eggs have to be just right, potatoes nice and brown and on the crispy side, English muffin well toasted and buttered and, of course, in the case of the chicken fried steak, no gristle or fat...........just nice, tasty chewable meat.  And, naturally, the sausage gravy has to meet my standards.  Regarding all of the above, it was perfection..........two times in a row!!  I never find that anywhere!  Not only that, this last time, I had the pleasure of having \"Mickie\" as my waitperson.  She was a doll and, despite how busy the place was, she was so on top of everything........a total sweetheart.  I will definitely request her on my return visits.  Here's the best part.........ANY breakfast on the menu is only $6.99,  including the one described above!!  What more can I say?!!?"}
{"text":"My husband, mother and friends all adore this place. We love breakfast on the weekends or late night bacon fests any night of the week.  The food is a great deal and we love that we can get the $2.99 breakfast late in the evening when my friends are drunk and demanding bacon, LOL.  Waitresses Sabrina, Pam, Candy & Vicci are just phenomenal.  Really, all of the waitresses are great.  Even on a crowded weekend morning they handle things fast and efficiently.  I am especially thankful to Sabrina, the night waitress, who puts up with my drunk friends like a champ.  She is always so nice and on top of things.  All waitresses should be like this woman!

They give you a coupon for a two-for-one meal practically every time you come in.  It doesn't apply to the $2.99 breakfast special but is a great deal for any regular item on the menu.  

Country Boys is the best diner around hands down for quick and easy grub."}
{"text":"Great home style cooking with a ton of options. Coupons always available so you may get BOGO any time you come in. Fish is the only meat I eat and there are a few options. Strict vegetarians may have a hard time but plenty of sides? Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good value with a Buy One get One Free coupon, for a low budget breakfast, lunch or dinner. They are open 24 hours and serve breakfast all day long.
Service is friendly and consistently good. Food is really not the best quality but for the price it is a really good deal.
I have tried many different items on the menu, mostly breakfast and dinner, and my favorite is the Spanish steak, which is a hamburger meat patty covered with cheese and salsa. Chicken fried steak is also good, it comes with 2 patties for dinner, or one patty and 2 eggs for breakfast.
For a side I usually get the home fries, extra crispy.
Overall a friendly restaurant and the prices are budget friendly too."}
{"text":"NO frills. That's what you will find here.
This isn't exactly a pretty neighborhood, so when my sister mentioned trying them for breakfast with the kids I didn't exactly jump for joy.
We gave it a shot anyway...very pleasantly surprised.
Really great service..we had 2 little ones, and our waitress was so kind and patient.
The interior of the restaurant is plain; whatever was here before, was left exactly that way.
Some 80's seating...benches and plain table tops, plain walls. 
Our food was pretty fantastic. I had a bacon and cheese omlette with country potatoes that was just perfect.
My coffee cup was never empty. Coffee is poured throughout breakfast. I don't know about you all, but there is nothing more annoying than going to breakfast, and getting to the bottom of your mug, and no one ever refills. This was great (and a reminder of diner service in NJ)  Big fluffy biscuits and the kids menu is fantastic and reasonable..and they gave us coupons to come back.
We went on a Saturday morning and we had about a 5 minute wait..the place was filled with seniors and families. Perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap breakfast option.. this is it! Located next to McDonalds.. I had the create your own combo breakfast for $3.49 .. two eggs, toast and I added a side of ham (add .75c) and coffee.. 

Basic options.. pancakes, toast, hash brown, French toast and just so you don't forget this is an old school diner .. cottage cheese, sliced peaches or pineapple (I'm guessing canned)

Coffee was weak but not bad in flavor .. the service was great, I was greeted and checked on several times, coffee cup was refilled .. I will be back for this basic breakfast .."}
{"text":"I don't get it.   The food is excellent and the prices are unbelievably low. The servers are very friendly.   The restaurant is light and airy - and spotless.   Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place so close to my house and definitely great food big portions for the right price. Great variety of breakfast choices. My favorite is the biscuits and gravy"}
{"text":"I love breakfast. There are plenty of places in north Phoenix for breakfast, but if you want home style cooking, Country Boys is where to go. I love the staff here, and the omelets are amazing."}
{"text":"I think this location might be a step above their others. We have eaten here several times. The portions on most things is great, sometimes crazy. Food has always been hot and tasty, and service is always pretty good. There can be a wait for breakfast on the weekend, and I'm sure it will get longer add it really is a great choice."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. We come here all of the time. Staff is always great and the food is perfect for a homemade breakfast with no mess to clean up later."}
{"text":"We came here because a coworker of mine recommended it. She doesnt have bad taste so I'm unsure as to why this place was so bad.
My husband ordered the biscuits & gravy and the gravy tasted like pure flour. Whoever made it didnt cook the roux long enough to take away the taste of the flour.
I got the veggie skillet which had bell peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms (canned), and onions, with potatoes. The veggies weren't sauteed at all. Everything lacked flavor. Even my sourdough toast tasted like plain white toast. 
I felt so sad coming here....we should have gone to Danny's. 
At least our server was great."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Food overpriced for quality and cook refused to make egg white omelette. 
The place appears to be converted from another run down store and the renovation did not include the booths.  As someone sat behind me, the back of my booth bent forward. 
Pass on this place and hit up Filiberto's right next door.  Better quality food for a better price."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food.  This place is great, and right around the corner!  Will be a regular customer.  A gem in N Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I was pleased with Country Boy's Restaurant. I come from the country and wanted some good old homecooked meal type of food and that's what you get here. The food as well as the service are of good quality and the prices are great. The d√©cor is undergoing some aesthetic changes and because I could see both parts, the old and new, I'd say it will be a nicer looking place when done so don't judge a book by an outdated cover. All in all, nothing overly special, but good prices and good food."}
{"text":"Great place to get breakfast 24 hours a day. We've been coming to this place since they opened and every Sunday we come and have breakfast before we head out for our other daily fun. They have a great $2.99 menu for those on a budget (and it's a good bit of food too for that price) to more expensive meals for those who want more. The staff is always friendly and prompt with service."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Country Boys by my father, who I went to go visit for a few days in Scottsdale last month. This is his favorite go to cheap breakfast place. While I was visiting we came here twice.

Both times I ordered from the Super Deal Menu and ordered option C. Create Your Own Breakfast Combo $2.99. The first time I ordered bacon, scrambled eggs and biscuits and gravy. The biscuits and gravy cost an extra $.50 and I think that was very reasonable. It was a really filling meal for under $4. The biscuits and gravy were very tasty. The second time we came here I ordered bacon, scrambled eggs, hash-browns and french toast. The french toast was an extra $1.29. The single slice of french toast has a huge glob of butter in the middle, it was okay but I don't think it is worth an extra $1.29. 

Overall this place has got me hooked on their breakfast prices. Next time I am in Scottsdale, this is my go to breakfast spot. Did I mention it is open seven days a week and open twenty-four hours? 

If you have a large party (6 or more) there will be some waiting time. There is also plenty of parking and there is outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of this place other than its open 24/7 and being I work nights it's hard to find late night places still open when I get off work so was disappointed it wasn't better. Food was just blan out of box like and waitress wasn't very friendly or even smile at all the whole time we were there"}
{"text":"What the he double hockey sticks?Had a good meal last week so took my friend for lunch.The food was like garbage.Ordered my French dip and also my friend the same. I hope we don't get sick as the meat tasted rank and old.The Waitress quickly offered us a replacement.We tried by ordering  BLT and a Patty melt. The  onions on the Patty were chunks and raw, the Bacon on the BLT was a big gob of fat and raw. We had a very efficient  waitress and was the best. This place should be checked by health dept. as i think their food is bad .Won't ever eat there again. .Ever."}
{"text":"Country Boys is located on the North East Corner of Greenway and 32nd Street, the restaurant has been several different restaurants over the years.  The decor is old type diner, restaurant was clean.

Server was nice, but make sure to tell Server immediately if using a Groupon or Coupon - many different discounts to be had but some with restrictions. 

Order the great breakfast which basically included all that breakfast entails - be prepared for a nap after this large breakfast.  Everything was fresh and good, very filing."}
{"text":"Country Boys Restaurant is one of those places I've driven by for years but never bothered to try. The banner advertising a cheap breakfast was never the way to get me in the door. I'm happy to say I finally took the plunge and was nicely rewarded.

The cooking is home style and basic, but done very well. The clientele is nicely mixed, generally a bit older perhaps. The waitresses are friendly and prompt with the coffee. On this day, I felt no pressure to vacate my booth as I did some work, always a huge plus for me. The d√©cor is admittedly a touch stale, with a bit of an 80's vibe, but it's consistent with the food. Basic.

You'll be disappointed if you come in search of whole wheat protein pancakes, egg white omelettes... this is not a spot for trendy alternatives or gourmet selections. But if you like your coffee hot and and your pancakes fluffy, this spot is for you. Menu prices are very reasonable, even without promotions. Don't forget to check the white boards (left and right as you enter) for specials. Look for the $2.99 deals posted on each table if you're really on a budget. They might also give you two for one coupons when you pay at the counter. If you're offended by coupons or by paying too little, you'll just have to look elsewhere.

Another plus: Country Boys Restaurant is open 24 hours a day, a rarity in metro Phoenix. One of four locations."}
{"text":"Even though the seats are dated and the service is not great one day my wife was served a hair in her omelette . We both understand it happens , but when we told the server she didn't have anything to say. No free meal or discount so we eat other places now. The food  is not all that great."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hatred is about in everyone's posts. I came in, greeted with great service, order taken, food came out rather quickly. My boyfriend and I both ordered the corned beef hash. Let me tell you, this order came with a side of hash browns and a side of your choice. I got the biscuits and gravy. The portions are very generous, the food was amazing, and our server was awesome. My boyfriend and I can both eat more than one normally should, we could not even finish our plates we were so full. 

We will be returning customers. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is solid, the prices are reasonable, the wait staff is friendly and COMPETENT, and the coffee is decent.
This restaurant is not chi-chi, so don't bring a date, but if you and your friends want good, solid food, GO!
Warning, they aren't 24 hours anymore."}
{"text":"I wish I could say I love this place. I want to love it. I mean breakfast 24/7. What's not to love, right? Well.. The home fries smelled and tasted of the most rancid GMO oil you can imagine. I wanted to eat them so badly, but I could only manage to choke down a few pieces before giving into the fact that these were the least healthy potatoes I had ever been exposed to in my life. I wasn't looking for a healthy meal when I walked into this place, quite the opposite. But these potatoes were obviously going to kill someone and soon. If this restaurant started using something better to cook their food in, preferably coconut oil, I'd be here way more than I should. As it stands, I will probably very sadly never be back. :("}
{"text":"My wife and I love country boys! The Groupon makes it even cheaper......They are consistently good quality food. Simple, good and cheap with a very nice friendly staff that takes good care of you what more really needs to be said.  I highly recommend going here for Country Fried Steak and Egg breakfast combo."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE....HORRIBLE....HORRIBLE....HORRIBLE!!!!! Then, to add insult to injury, we had to pay for the food!!! Over medium eggs were 100% runny, extra crispy hashbrowns were almost raw potatoes, steak medallions (referred to as filet mignon by cook) tasted microwaved and were comparable to eating a rubber boot full of gristle, biscuits and gravy were only decent part, yet the gravy was ice cold...we waited 20 minutes after we were thru eating for her to look our way so we could get a box for the food we could bring home to our dogs... waitress was COMPLETELY aware and chose to \"not bother us\" while we were eating!!! What a JOKE!!!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted previously frozen. I got the chili cheese fries made up of frozen fries topped with canned chili, the western burger which was okay besides the obviously previously frozen and barely fried onion ring and the huge piece of bacon fat in the middle, and my girlfriend got the Philly cheese steak which she described as tasting like the whole sandwich was previously frozen then reheated and topped with gross cheese. I'm so disappointed. Nothing about this experience was good. Why does everything in Phoenix suck???"}
