{"text":"This has to be the best sushi in the town...I know that doesn't say much as the town only has 180.000 people but the sushi at Mye is comparable to sushi that you would get in downtown Toronto. The fish is fresh and marvelously presented. The price is what one should expect if they are dining in Downtown Oakville and as one lives nearby one is accustomed to the prices, but one feels they more than compensate for this with a classy ambiance and top of the line presentation and service. Joan, the Filipina waitress always takes great care of me and whoever I am with. The quiet atmosphere makes this restaurant ideal for business dinners, special engagements, and important conversations. I recommend any dishes with thw bbq eel, tempura, or mochi ice cream. Leave children elsewhere as they do not have a child's menu..."}
{"text":"Typical dime a dozen Chinese operated Japanese joint. Fish quality, execution and the service definitely doesn't justify the price. If this the best Japanese place in Oakville, I'm more than willing to drive an hour to go to a proper Japanese place in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food is quite good, especially the dynamite rolls,spider rolls and the green dragon. Service is on the slow side however and the ambience is kind of bland."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the service here and food as its always consistent, and if you know Oakville you really have a limited restaurants to choose from. So I would recommend this place if you really want a consistency top to bottom and a great selection of sushi. I would recommend the sushi and sashimi platters to start for two people."}
{"text":"Excellent as always! Fish was so fresh, delicately prepared, and delicious. Our server took great care of us from start to finish. We took some friends who have never been there and they agreed that every morsel was outstanding. Definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and decided to try it out.  The decor is very dated and I waited at the front entrance for 8 mins before deciding to walk thru a hallway to get to the dinning room, where the reception desk was?  You would think the reception would be at the entrance but its not.  Now, down to the food...great sushi, fresh real wasabi (big bonus in my books vs. the powdered stuff), tempura was great as well.  Was pricey, but in downtown Oakville you \"run with it\". 4 stars on the food, 0 stars on the welcome/reception part, 2 stars on the decor, 3.5 on the service. Net result, if you love sushi and don't mind being ignored when you walk in and eating at a place that was designed in 1988, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning! The environment is nice and warming and the food is amazing! The sushi is super fresh and the sushi rice was just perfect!"}
{"text":"I've been to japenese restaurants across the world and this is the best one on the planet. The age dashi tofu has no competition and the sushi is outstanding it's worth going to oakville just for the meal"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best fish at any sushi place in the area. While the decor is rather plain, it is offset by wonderful servers and great sushi.  Also has an extensive Japanese menu for non sushi eaters. This is one of those restaurants that becomes a once a week place for a wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"hands down the best sushi in oakville - probably toronto area. i've been going to myee for over 5 years. never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Oakville.  Always super fresh and meticulously cut. The service is consistently friendly and the atmosphere is fantastic. Recommend frequently to my friends."}
{"text":"Foods not fresh and service is really really BAD and POOR. ( I am giving negative 10 stars )"}
{"text":"I am a native of Japan and Mye is definitely the place I will go to when I want to eat Sushi.

Everything you eat at Mye is guaranteed fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"This is one a the few authentic Japanese restaurants that is actually run by a Japanese! Wonderful fresh sashimi. Would definitely come back again and again.  This sushi place has just officially been marked on my list."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Oakville and a great alternative to the oversupply of Italian joints nearby. Sushi is fresh, atmosphere fitting and service is good. Probably the most you'll pay for sushi in oakville but also the best. Sashimi is top notch and the the rolls are put together nicely. They also have a fair number of non sushi Japanese options but i haven't tried much of that. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not one to really complain on social media about things, but I have to draw the line. Four of us went to Mye Sushi in Oakville for dinner tonight. We waited and waited for our order, and I watched our food sit on a counter for at least 20 minutes. I asked the server if our food was coming soon, and it still took another 5 minutes to get to the table.I can understand that the place was busy, but it is not that big, and there were at least 5 wait staff on.
When it did get there, the sushi and sashimi was one of the worst we have ever had. Now, before we reserved here, we looked at the reviews, which were all good, and our friend, who has spent copious time in Japan chose this place over another restaurant in Oakville, by virtue of the reviews. All the reviews were terrific, so I can only assume that the people who have eaten here have never had good sushi before. The bill was about $250 for the four of us, and I really resent the fact that this meal, such as it was cost that kind of money. That is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for substandard food and service"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar seats, we heart from the chef, this restaurant has already been there for 30 years. Quiet environment, good quality, and very kind chef!"}
{"text":"Once we walked into the restaurant there was a smell of chlorine javel...but my fiance didn't smell anything.  The ambiance is quite romantic, very clean and quiet place to eat.  Our waitress was a bit too intense with taking the order, she came by like every minute to ask us if we r ready to order... 
We order the tuna carpaccio as an appetizer and oh my goodness it was delicious!  the tuna basically melted in your mouth! Then we had a salad which came with the sushi dinner.  The salad was good but was really cold, not room/chill temperature.  We ordered the sushi and sashimi dinner (comes with a bowl of white or brown rice).  The sushi were really good, everything just melted and was made in the perfect temperature!  Overall it was a good experience and will Def go back to try other things in their menu!"}
{"text":"A great Japanese restaurant experience. Took my family here twice. 

The restaurant is small and very quaint. They have a proper sushi-bar with a Japanese chef, and there is even a small tatami-mat seating area for those inclined to go full-traditional. Fear not, most of the restaurant is  table seating.

First time we went for the sushi, to see if it was truly as good as the already glowing reviews. As someone who spent over a year living and sushi-hunting in Japan, I was pleasantly surprised to have this so close to home. Uni (my test of sushi quality) was superb.

The second time we came for the 7-course \"Mye Special Dinner\". Very well worth it. There was attention to detail in every dish, and just enough of it to enjoy it and have room for the other 6. Highlights included the tuna carpaccio, takosu salad, delectably tender steak, and of course a small sushi platter. Finished with ice cream and fruit. 

Try the Nigori sake they serve as well."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Really a nice lil Oakville gem. I recommend the green dragon roll and the dynamite roll - yummy."}
{"text":"Most Authentic Japanese I've ever had.  Everything plays into the feel of Japan.  They even have a room where you take off your shoes and sit on the floor.  The fish was incredibly fresh and the staff was very attentive.  I loved the way I felt transported to Japan for the night. Great little getaway."}
{"text":"We had plans to go to another sushi place for mothers day and when I looked it up on Yelp, I had to switch venues. The nearest one in the area was Mye. OMG, one of the best finds on Yelp!

The food is a little more pricey but well worth it. The service was very good and personable. They made us feel very welcome and at home.

I tried the sukiyaki dinner, which was suggested by the owner. Best decision I ever made - even though it was $32/person! I tried to be a little more adventurous and tried it with a raw egg. Delicious.

I will definitely come back here for Mother's Day again... and if I'm in town for some sushi."}
{"text":"All of the dishes that we ordered were exceptional. The service was fantastic. The sashimi was some of the freshest I've had for a long time."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good if you don't want to drive all the way to downtown Toronto. When it comes to Asian cuisine, I want the real deal, no fusion or AYCE or food court versions please.

Quality & freshness - good
Taste - good
Value - good
Ambiance - great
Service - good

Favorites - tuna tataki, spicy tuna hand rolls, salad with ginger dressing

Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood and decided to try this restaurant in Oakville. Living in downtown Toronto, we are spoiled by excellent sushi avail abilities.  We are usually tentative to try a new restaurant in suburb since the quality is just not there compared to restaurants in downtown Toronto. 

We were glad that we tried this restaurant. 

The food and and service were excellent. Everything we ordered was yummy and the service was good. If we end up coming in this way, we will definitely visit Mye again."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi place.Good ambiance, great service and very fresh food."}
{"text":"Simply the best. The owner Mo is a world class chef. I love the tuna carpaccio and Yakiniku. The chicken Ton Katsu is amazing at lunch."}
{"text":"Ratings:
Food: 9.5/10
Drink: 9/10
Service: 8/10
Value: 8/10
Hygiene: 10/10
Aesthetics: 9/10

The first time I came here was over 10 years ago and I was amazed with the quality of the food. That has definitely not changed over the years and it is as good, if not better. The fish here is always fresh and always a good choice. One of my favorite things here has got to be the fried chicken. 

The restaurant keeps a good selection of various sake choices available. You can always ask them for a recommendation of the type that you are looking for. 

If you are looking a la carte sushi in Oakville, this is one of the only places. Although it's not always open for lunch, they have a second shop just off of Dundas and Trafalgar that is usually open at those hours. The second location is managed by the same chef (Mo) and you'll see him there just as often. The second location however has a slightly different and more limited menu, and has a little friendlier price tag.

The atmosphere is very cozy and they have a fireplace in the waiting area. I enjoy all the sake cups along the wall as they add a little bit of the chef's flavor to the decor.

The service can be a little slow at times, but I don't ever come here in a rush and they never seem pushy about getting you out the door. 

This is easily one of the better restaurants in all of Oakville and I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Food, service, atmosphere: all were fantastic. The sushi was of  excellent quality. The décor is befitting a Japanese restaurant. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow to begin, but they apologized and it was fine after that. To drink my wife and I had a 1/2L of Merlot. Nice wine for he price. They brought a light \"palate cleanser\" consisting of bean sprouts, cucumber strips, two small cubes of chicken and a light dressing. It was really fresh and nice to start. As an appetizer we had a Dynamite sushi roll; this was excellent. Although I don't normally eat a lot of sushi, I would have ordered more of this. Next we were brought a salad with a typical ginger dressing. For dinner my wife had the seafood tempura. It was good, but nothing special. We agreed we would not order it again. I had the teriyaki salmon. It was also excellent. Perfectly cooked and the sauce was a great complement. The veggies were blanched and also really good. We finished with creme brûlée which we both really  enjoyed. A nice, light dessert. Overall, a great meal. If we had gone for just sushi, probably would have earned another star."}
{"text":"Utterly disappointed to say the least. I had been meaning to try the food at Mye Sushi for quite some time. Having dined at sushi restaurants all over the world including Japan, I was expecting a decent meal as the owner is Japanese and the restaurant bills itself as authentic. Critics who rave about all you can eat places have obviously never eaten real quality sushi. I would've expected quality sushi and \"authentic\" quality Japanese service. Far from it!

The service was was horrible and I felt as though I was being waited on by fast food service staff who didn't know anything about Japanese cuisine. The food was definitely sub par and only a slight step above food court quality. For the premium price, this place is highly overrated and the owner really needs to get back to the roots of what authentic Japanese dining and quality \"Japanese\" service means. 

If anyone is looking for a better sushi experience, I would recommend an \"unnamed\" restaurant on Cross St across from the GO station.

I'll never go back to Mye again.

Terrible experience and definitely not worth the money!"}
{"text":"Loved every single piece of sushi, even the ones that I normally don't like. Great service excellent sushi and rolls."}
{"text":"I went here first for their sukiyaki which was good. Their sushi is what i have been going back for. It is always fresh and the presentation is refined. The location is chic but not formal. The staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The food was okay although our server was very rude and absent. From the moment we sat down, she arrived to ask what we want before greeting us. She left with an attitude and verbally complaining because we were not ready yet. She never came back to ask if we were okay or not. We had our water towards the end of our meal. She also complained cuz we did not leave a proper tip (we really did not have any proper service!). 

Very rude and unpleasant experience overall. 
I don't think I will comeback."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and fast.  Atmosphere is clean and modern.  Food is fresh and delish!"}
{"text":"All I would say that our whole family loves Japanese food. We are regular visitors to several Spoon &Fork restaurants.  But this was not an impressive restaraunt.  The quality was submitted par and prices quite steep. ."}
{"text":"If I were to rate Mye on the service, appetizers (mushroom plate and teriyaki chicken) and wine it would easily merit five stars. Both of our mains (steak and shrimp/vegetable tempura) were a little disappointing and quite bland. This came as a huge surprise after the great beginning.

As well the main course did take longer to arrive than I would have expected. We will and perhaps alter our course slightly and see where that lands us next time because there are simply too many rave reviews for this to happen again."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends. There was nothing that specially about the place. It was kinda hard to find because of their tiny sign. We had to make a few trips around the block until we found it. Felt like the place was overpriced

The sashimi was average nothing extremely special. Something you can find anywhere else.  

The fish we ordered was good but the portion was really small. I think it was cod. 

The tuna carpaccio was good but any nothing that blew my mind. 

Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is meh. Sushi is probably the best you can find in Oakville, but if you can tolerate a drive you can do just as well elsewhere, cheaper and with better service. Toronto, Mississauga and Markham just have much better overall experiences. 

Excellent squid sashimi, tuna was above average, salmon was not a good fish.

This is a very \"downtown Oakville\" restaurant. Hire some polite waitstaff, it seemed all three that we interacted with were mildly unpleasant. As someone who lived in Japan for a few years, the rude wait staff ruin the ambiance for me. They are not Japanese, nor do they manage even the basics of Japanese politeness, something that every kid who works at a Los Angeles Uniqlo somehow manages to do."}
{"text":"There are not enough good things that I can say about Mye restaurant! Thanks to a friend, my husband and I decided to try Mye's out for dinner. They are gluten-free friendly which is a MAJOR plus. They had little hearts beside the meals that could be made gluten free, so no need to ask and be disappointed. We started with the salad that came with the entrees (small sprout salad with their signature dressing), and moved on to a cucumber and seaweed salad. Soooo good!! I had avocado and cucumber sushi and hubs had a mix of California rolls, and sashimi (salmon, tuna, etc). The sushi was so fresh and delicious. 1000% better than anything I've ever had. 
For the entrees I had chicken teriyaki, husband had steak and seafood. Despite being full to bursting, we both couldn't stop ourselves from eating 3/4 of our entrees before we packed the rest up. The sauces ... Omg the sauces. The meat was so flavorful, so well cooked - just the best chicken teriyaki that I've ever had. Possibly even the best chicken. No joke. 
Both entrees came with some sort of white sauce on the side.
Don't know what it was for, but I'm pretty sure there was crack in it. I have never been so in love with a sauce. We even asked for more to go (God love them, they gave it to us!). I can't even think of that sauce without drool pooling in my mouth. Mmmm 

We couldn't do dessert since we were both about to puke from overeating and only the ice cream options were gluten free. 

Overall, I can't say enough good things about Mye. We made a reservation online but went early enough that we could have walked in (5:30). By 6:30 the place was jammed. The staff were polite, the ambience was nice and calm, the food came quickly, it was all fresh and you could definitely tell. I will be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Nice cosy little spot, pretty good fish, but staff (friendly) easily overwhelmed during busy times. 
Raw bar much better than their hot items."}
{"text":"Great place! Sushi/rolls are very delicious and the restaurant itself is very neat and clean , which we loved. They are family/kids friendly as well...And eel roll is to die for! Keep it up. Amazing :)"}
{"text":"We have been coming here every Thursday for almost 10 years. The BEST BEST BEST sushi - we have yet to find somewhere better. Even in New York City or Las Vegas... doesn't compare. And the friendliest service and warmest hospitality. The grilled calamari is perfect. The black cod is amazing. The tempura is light and airy. The steak dinner melts in your mouth. And the sushi is the highest quality and prepared by the best sushi chefs. If you love sushi, this place is for you."}
{"text":"This was a casual and relaxing experience at this pleasant restaurant.  There's parking just across. All the servers were lovely and hardworking.  It's a short drive to take a lakeside walk after. The food was good, a little mild tasting for my pallet."}
{"text":"Very good food and decent service. Pluses were the salad (the sauce, yum) and Miso soup. The Tempura was correctly lightly battered but the sauce was fairly tasteless. Wife had Sushi, I had the Shokado dinner. Shokado was very well presented and was very tasty and includes tempura (ok), Beef and Salmon Yakiniku (excellent), some chicken, two pieces of Sushi, and Rice (brown or white).

Water and food were slow to come, but it was busy. I'm not sure it's worth a return trip."}
{"text":"I finally make my way to Mye Japanese Restaurant. I had it bookmarked on my Yelp profile for all these time and finally.....

The food here at Mye is traditional Japanese and traditional in the sense of every aspect: presentation, selections and the spirit. 

You won't find any rolls with wacky name or dirt cheap AYCE.

Chirashi Lunch ($23) with a choice of soup or salad. The salad dressing is light sesame based made in house. The fish was cut and prepared properly. But the star of my lunch was the Shari Rice! The rice has this perfect texture and bite.  I ate every single one of them........

I want to try Mye's Special menu next time.. but seriously why minimum of 2?!!

*Free Parking on Site but the lot is a little small!"}
{"text":"It was an amazing experience. They even surprised me with a birthday gift, which was very nice of them.
Loved the food, especially Sushi! The ginger, wasabi mix with the sushi was awesome, especially the ginger slices. Wash it down with hot sake. Aahhh!! Life is good. Haha!
They don't serve Ramen at this branch but had a lot of variety to make up."}
{"text":"MYe is very nice and has a lot of regular customers. The food is very good. We were very disappointed w our server who did not know or understand the menu and did not come and refill drinks or check on us. We had to wave her over constantly. She also spilled soy sauce on me wo any gesture to apologize. I don't know if she was new but it made the experience very negative."}
{"text":"Come here if you want QUALITY sushi rolls. The price is definitely at the higher end and there is not an exclusive lunch menu like you might find at other places. I would recommend if you are choosing miso soup or salad that you go for the salad, mostly for the dressing. It has a nice ginger/vinegar zest to it. Got two dishes the sushi lunch ($17) and the Mye Rainbow Roll ($11)hat comes with tuna, salmon, and a white fish with avocado in small rolls. It was all good but these rolls were small. I guess because one fish would overpower each other. It was a cute place and it seems like it has it dedicated customers. I am definitely coming back because they had black cod on the menu and I think that really shows if this is a top sushi restaurant in this area. If anyone goes and try it, let me know how it taste. I'm coming back to make my own review though."}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant, and my wife and I were impressed. Good food, great selection of food, nice ambiance, dining area was clean, and our server was nice and helpful. Did not have the description of what each sushi roll was, so we had to look it up on our smartphones. Otherwise, we would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Total and utter gouge. Yet another restaurant downtown Oakville that justifies its pricing of sub-par food based on location. Sushi is one step above supermarket quality, with about the same ambience. This place would benefit from a little competition."}
