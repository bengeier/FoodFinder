{"text":"Service is great - on-site wine and cheese pairing from an experienced sommerli√©re/cheesemonger. Wonderful experience - recommend that anyone with a distinguished taste and flair for adventure come by with friends for a one-of-a-kind experience."}
{"text":"This little gem was the location of a \"Pittsburgh Pop Up Yoga Event.\" I never knew it existed prior to tonight. The wine cellar is amazing. I would love to host a private party in this location. Parking was easy and convenient. The aesthetics were awesome and the space for the event was beautiful. We fit 75 yogis on the main floor."}
{"text":"Great place to try something different. Enjoyed a wine tasting and bought some wine. Free parking, wine tasting at your own pace and a great selection. Purchased bottles of wine so my wine tasting was free. The ladies were nice, knowledgeable and answered my questions. The place was very clean, nice decor and they had ample supply of wine. The prices are reasonable and the hours are great. I will certainly go back to purchase and enjoy another wine tasting. They sell autographed bottles in addition to unsigned bottles. The variety offers something for everyone. They are located next door to the Clemente Museum so you can schedule a tour then enjoy some wine. The celebs with wine includes local and national celebrities like Clemente, Hines Ward and Smokey Robinson. Great for date nite, girls night out or solo missions."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The atmosphere is charming! However on both Friday evenings we went and our group was the only patrons. I imagine this would be prime time for wine and cheese, so that's been a little bit of a red flag about its future to me. I love wine and cheese and am excited to engage in that pairing pretty much anytime! However, in both trips I've made here, me and my friends found the service bordering on cold and unfriendly. The wine is fine and the cheese is good; but expect to pay some steep prices here. Going forward, I'll head to Allegheny Wine Mixer. Both the food and wine selections, as well as service, are superior in my opinion with a comparable price point."}
{"text":"I recently hosted a party for 125 people at The Engine House 25/ Roberto Clemente Museum this past weekend.  It was awesome!!!!  
The venue is the coolest site in Pittsburgh for an event.  Our guests loved browsing the museum and the sports memorabilia and they LOVED the wine cellar and the wine sampling.  The staff is so helpful and accommodating.  Their event coordinator, Elizabeth is wonderful.  She takes the stress out of any event.  The wine staff were so knowledgable and so friendly.  Everyone had such a great night - we will be planning more events here!  I recommend this Pittsburgh Gem to everyone!"}
{"text":"What a great venue! This weekend I visited engine house for a holiday party and just loved it. What a great space! It was perfect for the event. The decor in the bottom floor was awesome with wine barrels, wooden tables, and a cigar room. For my taste, their red wine selections all had a little bit of a spicy finish, but I'd love to go back and give them an another try. 

The owner and the rest of the staff were all so pleasant and helpful as we all roamed around and tried all their wines. 

Definitely a nice addition to lawrenceville and I will be back!"}
