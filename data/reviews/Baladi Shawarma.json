{"text":"Finally some healthy and very tasty fast food near Kincora. Ordered 2 falafel platters. Falafel was cooked fresh to order. Came with a fresh greek salad (real kalamata's, not sliced Californian pizza olives), nice roasted potatoes, enough hummus for 4, hot pita, mid eastern style rice, garlic yogurt sauce and tahini. Everything was fresh and very flavorful. I watched the order prep from start to finish and hygiene was spot on. The lady that prepared the order handed me the order when it was ready. She stated with a big smile, \"Made with love for you, please enjoy\".  Awesome first impression from someone that is very particular. Will be going back soon.  I did not experience anything at all negative."}
{"text":"Horrible service considering it's a New business.  The owner needs to know that first impression is the last. No consideration for someone who come at the end of the day.  This happened twice.  The staff just looks dumb founded when they see someone at the end of the day.    I will NOT be returning to this location or recommending them to anyone. There are amazing shawarma places like (Shawarma Palace) we have been to Shawarma Palace many  locations with great customer service, even if we go few minutes before closing.    We are always served."}
{"text":"The good... It was our first time here today and it was really, really good! This place is tucked into a cozy corner in the Sage Hill shopping area. It's small inside, screaming easy and super flavorful food. The menu is easy to read, the service was friendly and very prompt. The ingredients are fresh and authentic, serving pickled Persian cucumbers instead of kerbies... so good!  One memorable thing that caught my eye was how they made their wraps, using a thin crepe-like wrap over the parted pita bread. When they finish the wrap in the hot press, it comes out very crispy and lighter than using an only pita. Excellent method and very tasty!  Pricing is very reasonable, medium wraps come at 9 bucks and are stuffed with plenty of meat and vegetables. This place is not chintzy at all!  The bad... The beef donair meat was a little too salty, but still very tasty.  The ugly... The fellow manning the food preparations has a pretty serious face when it gets busy, but I get the sense he just wants to serve people quickly and not make them wait long for their order.  When it calms down he seems more at ease. I can live with this; the place was pretty busy when we walked in at 4pm.  This was as ugly as it got, otherwise, it was pretty easy and fast to get some chill grub here.  What we ordered... A beef donair, a chicken shawarma, a bottle of water. All totaling to $21.   Come again?   Oh, you bet!"}
{"text":"Just got back from Baladi for dinner. We are repeat customers but this will be our last time coming here. Food is good but service the last 2 times has been horrid!!! They serve all their \"to go\" and ppl who order \"wraps\" first. After waiting for a half hr..I finally asked where our food was cuz we were the last ones waiting for food and literally the first to order. Owner lost his cool and said they have a \"system\". What system...making ppl with a 2 yr old wait a half hr for food when they pump others in and out? When we left ...owner kept his head down...I had to say \"have a good night\". Def not a professional business. This will be our last visit."}
{"text":"New spot in the NW in Sage Hill.  Much needed spot in the area.  They claim to use local ingredients such as chicken.  The food seems very authentic, but I am 5th generation CANADIAN...so what do I know .  Local small business so they can always use the support.  We bring our kids as there is good seating available for a family of 6."}
{"text":"Really really good food. Excellent staff. Perfect business for the NW!!  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not sure why the others gave such a harsh review to this place. I've been there multiple times and have been welcomed with nothing but joy. The staff is very sweet and cater to your every need. The food is also top notch, definitely one of the best shawarma places in Calgary!"}
