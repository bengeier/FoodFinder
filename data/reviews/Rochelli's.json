{"text":"Great local option for pizza! You may pay a few extra bucks compared to the Papa Johns and Pizza Huts of the world but it is worth every penny. We went with the large crust which is actually the only size and crust options they offer. I prefer pizzas in a large and thin crust form but I was surprised they didn't not have a smaller version especially for those who are ordering for two. Well...two and half since one of the people was me. As for the pizza itself it was terrific. So often when you order thin crust via a delivery method it ends up being more like a soft tortilla pizza as opposed to the crackery texture all thin crust lovers aspire to find. Let's just say that our pizza was much closer to the cracker end of the spectrum which was a pleasant and unexpected surprise. I highly recommend giving their pizza a shot if you love real thin crust pizza. Oh and the onion rings are outstanding as well!!"}
{"text":"Where to start..... Food just isn't very good. Price is high for what you get. Average at best"}
{"text":"I was excited that a new pizza place opened up. I heard it was good but to my surprise it was bad. The pizza is way TOO expensive.  I hope he can make some changes as it would be great to have a pizza place in the neighborhood.  Back to Bashas for pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza with half onion and half ham and pineapple. The crust was paper thin, the sauce had no flavor or spices, and for the toppings, it only had a few onions on one side and on the other, three pieces of pineapple and we couldn't even find any ham. As for their homemade onion rings, couldn't say since they haven't had any for the past couple months."}
{"text":"We tried the Italian beef sandwich today and all I can say is WOW.  The beef was lean and sliced thin with onions, spicy peppers and melted cheese.   The roll was outstanding, light and fluffy with a crispy outside.  A side of au jus that had a nice flavor and wasn't too salty.  The sandwich itself is gigantic, more than enough for two people.  Grabbed a couple of slices too and they were delicious as usual.  As I mentioned before, the location is awesome because they have good parking and the grocery store is right around the corner. If you live in the area you are missing out if you haven't tried Rochellis!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! They have the best sauce and the best crust I've ever tasted. And THE ONION RINGS!!! So good!   I've also tried the meatball sub -- this too was AMAZING!   As if the food wasn't enough to keep me coming back, the service is pretty great too! They have some really nice people working there; it's a really family friendly place."}
{"text":"Same rings, same great pizza! The same owners as the ones in N Phoenix have reopened at Bell & Thompson Peak!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza, calzones and sandwiches in town. My favorite is a sausage (housemade), mushrooms (fresh not canned crap), and onion pizza. And you must NOT miss the onion rings. Casual place to pick up and take home, or hang out and have a slice. Skip the mass-produced plastic crap and come here to get real pizza."}
{"text":"Called to order takeout 20 minutes ago (it's Saturday night at 5:15 pm). Get a message that they can't answer the phone because they are either helping another customer or its outside of business hours (which it's not).  I can honestly say I've never called a pizza place and got an answering machine. Seriously?  Made my decision easy. Went to Bashas instead."}
{"text":"The owner is a sweetheart and has the best service ever! He gave me a slice of pizza to try at no charge and now I am regular customer! Also his sauces are made from scratch and everything is freshly made! The ingredients are not canned but the pineapple! What a delightful addition to our neighborhood!  Super happy plus it's thin dough!!! Yum! Wish he had gluten free though :) hehe the missing star is only for his busy days, since everything is fresh, there's a wait :("}
{"text":"Hmmm Subway or the owner operated restaurant next door? Well that wasn't really that hard of a choice but a great discovery none the less! Owner was polite and helpful in explaining his restaurants value proposition which after I experienced the Italian Beef American couldn't agree with more! I love small back East styled establishments like Rochelli's which take pride in their food and aren't concerned with the decor! Great place to grab a slice or enjoy a truly remarkable sandwich and enjoy the views of the McDowell Mountains. I'll Be Back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. I've been there 3 times since we discovered it 10 days ago.  The crust, the sauce and the toppings are all excellent and authentic. I love how the outer crust is perfectly crispy yet soft in the middle, perfect to fold; as god intended pizza to be eaten."}
{"text":"The pizza was good; above average.  Good sauce, awesome dough and real cheese.  I'm not sure why they charge around $20 for a large pizza though.  While the pizza is good and the location is convenient to all the nearby neighborhoods, I'm not sure that the value is there.  Maybe better for individual slices than carrying out full pies, but I don't see that as a viable business model."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to write reviews like this. A new pizza place opens in the neighborhood. They deliver. They're replacing a pizza place that was below par. The neighbors are excited to try a new place that can be their 'go to' restaurant for a quick lunch or to pick up for dinner on the way home. This is not that place.  First of all, I would expect a pizza place to specialize in pizza. By that I mean that you go there for a full pizza experience. The tables don't have crushed red pepper, fresh grated Parmesan, or italian seasoning (oregano, etc..). You can pick up pre-packaged pepper and Parmesan in little packets by the soda machine, but I wouldn't expect that for dine-in customers.  I expect a selection of pizzas by the slice for lunch. There was only cheese, pepperoni, and meat sauce. None of them looked very appetizing - they looked flat and cold.  I stopped there on a weekday for lunch. Two slices of pizza: one pepperoni, one cheese. Both had thin crusts, burnt on the bottom. The sauce wasn't sweet, but wasn't zesty either, and had a strange sour/bitter flavor. It was also darker than I expected, and I suspect there was a lot of tomato paste in there -- too much paste. The sauce was thinly applied, as was the cheese. Basically  picture a burnt cracker with a thin layer of sour tomato paste, with a final thin layer of greasy cheese.  It was not good enough for me to even eat. I took two bites of each slice and threw them away in disgust. This was not what I was hoping for.  To contrast that pizza, I went around the corner in the same shopping center to Basha's, and purchased a slice of pepperoni pizza from their in-house brick oven pizzaria. The crust was perfect, the sauce zesty without being sweet, and the cheese was thick and gooey. Pepperoni was crispy on the edges and had a spicy bite.  I must say that it's not a good sign when a pizza place is outdone by the grocery store in the same shopping center. I'm very disappointed in my experience at Rochelli's and will not be back."}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped in after a WestWorld event. This was some seriously good pizza. The crust was crisp and the sauce and toppings were good. Just the right amount of cheese.  It seemed like they were a little unorganized, which we later found out that they've just re - opened. There are still a few timing kinks to work out, but the food was delicious. I had a couple of slices and the hubs had wings.  These slices were so good that I can't wait to try a whole pie! Unfortunately they aren't nearby our home, but this won't be my last WestWorld event so I'll be back.  (They're closed on Sundays, bummer because I would have made my next visit today after WW)"}
{"text":"I'm definitely glad Rochelli's has reopened. My husband and I has lunch there on Saturday. We got our fix of onion rings and pepperoni pizza. Ryan was our sever. Even though he was flying solo, managed to take care of us, a family of four and make two to go orders practically at the same time. Ryan did a great job. See you guys soon."}
{"text":"So happy to see Rochelli's doors open in Scottsdale. The pizza is terrific and the friendly, mom and pop service can't be beat. This place is permanently secured on our regular rotation of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! I had the white with chicken, bf had the pepperoni- and wow both were incredible. Naturally thin crust, home made, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, the call in was great and handled well. Delivery was fast and the gal was really nice.   Now to the nitty gritty.... The pizza was soggy, flavor average at best. ... Just a bad pizza. The sauce non existent,  toppings sparse and you could get better at Domino's for half the price. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"I only had the Calzone, Hawaiian. It's delicious, the cheese is sweet and tasty. The breading is soft, but not too soft. It's not crunchy (I don't like crunchy calzones).  The portion is plentiful. I have had it twice now. I work around the block from this place.  The inside dining area isn't special or fancy, it's cheap but it works and it could be worse.   I think the price justifies the product.   One reviewer complained it's too expensive, this isn't a chain pizza place. It's a small business in an area that doesn't get a lot of lunch traffic. The owner isn't exactly rolling in profits. I have no proof except for taste, but I bet the cheese is fresh and that costs more  I recommend picking it up or getting it delivered, although I never had it delivered.  I usually eat at the table outside.  Calzone and Soda runs you $14+, depending on toppings.  I haven't had the pizza or anything else except the calzone."}
{"text":"Pizza itself was fairly good and I appreciated the crust the most with the extra residual flour that was present.  Too many places use cornmeal instead.  Slices were hot.  Not a good value - 2 slices and soda was $8.27.  Not competitive, to put it politely.  One major, major drawback is that there is sometimes a horrendous sewer smell in there and something like that makes it very difficult to eat food when enduring.  It was more noticeable towards the back, around the soda fountains and such.  Still, hard to enjoy food in here."}
