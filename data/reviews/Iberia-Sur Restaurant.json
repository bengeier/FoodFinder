{"text":"Had dinner here a few weekends ago, delicious! The service was fabulous,  very knowledgable about the menu and what to eat, the food came out hot, and quickly. The atmosphere is great, would defiantly eat here again, and recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was so displeasing that I had to write a review. Now where to begin? It took them ages to get anything to our table. We had ordered the picada (meat and cheese board) and it was so disappointing. The meats were overly salty and tasted as if they had just opened a packaged bag of deli from a grocery store. A charcuterie board anywhere else would be better. Now between this and dinner, it had probably taken them over 30 mins to get the dinner plates to us. In that time, they had forgotten my friends' dish (parrillada) and so they had to wait another 10+ mins. It's ok if there was just one mistake but there were several more. My flank steak was so salty, as if they had left it in a salt bowl overnight. The vegetables were dull and plain. You could tell the potatoes and vegetables were dried out from sitting under a heat lamp. I had them cook me another steak which was still unimpressive. The three pieces of steak on my dish were unevenly cooked. One was raw, the other was medium rare, and the third was somewhere in the middle. For $25, I could've gotten a better steak elsewhere. While my friends were waiting for their dish, everyone else at the table were eating their steaks with butter knives because the servers had yet to bring us our steak knives. We had ordered a bottle of wine but had dissappeared with the waiter. When he had come back to fill up our glasses, he made the poor mistake of overshooting the glass and pouring wine all over the table. Furthermore, when the parrillada finally showed up, all the meats were dry and overcooked. The steaks were again oversalted to the point where you can taste and feel the salt grains because the meat can't absorb anymore more salt. Everything was just dissapointing. The worse thing was that it was my friend's birthday dinner. She had hoped the restaurant would live up to the reviews and BlogTO article, but obviously not. 

The food was overpriced for its quality. The servers were mediocre amd forgetful. And the chefs really have no sense of taste. My friends and I won't ever return. Take your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Ordered online through just-eat.  Had the milanesa and lomito sandwich.  Delicious.  The side fries though stole the show.  They were Belgian style and you get a lot included.  So tasty.

All and all, dinner for two with tax and tip at $25.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday with my wife and another couple for dinner. I saw it on blogto and thought we would give it a try, and wow, were we impressed. 

We started off with the mushroom salad (amazing) a platter of the empanadas and calamari which I kept stealing off my wife's plate. My flank steak was very juicy and well grilled (medium), I decided to have half of my steak with the homemade chimichurri sauce, boy I wish I didn't save it for only half, this was AMAZING, so much so we took a mini container of it to go. ($5 not bad price) 

Our friends had the fish, I think it was called 'dourada', not sure if that's how you spell it. They both loved it, so of course, I had to try a piece. It was nicely grilled and you could tell it was fresh not frozen from the all the flavours. 

Our server, Kevin, was extremely friendly and made our experience even better. 

One thing I have to recommend to try if you still have room after the massive portions, is the flan dessert. I've never had flan before and found myself wondering why I waited 27 years to try it. Delicious!!

Definitely will be coming back very soon, food and service was great and with wine and a full meal it was less than $45 per person!"}
{"text":"I went with my family for Christmas dinner on Tuesday. It had a laid back and nice ambiance. They had some Latin music playing in the background and that fireplace thing on the two TVs. The place seemed super clean as did the bathroom. There were five of us, we started by sharing the calamari, the clams, and a chorizo flatbread, and the waiter randomly brought an order of empanadas and said \"this is for the table,\" really nice of him. My father gobbled the flatbread himself right away. The clams were delicious in their sauce and the texture of the calamari was exceptional. My sisters didn't like it because it tasted too much like balsamic so I ate the whole thing myself. None of us really eat meat so my sister's boyfriend and my dad shared the empanadas which I think comes with two beef and two chicken. I didn't ask how they were but they seemed to disappear.

For my meal I ordered the Chilean seabass with vegetables and risotto. The seabass was perfectly cooked. The risotto was the star of the dish. It was a mushroom risotto that day but they change it. I liked the dish. My sisters both got the same thing and they enjoyed it too. My dad tried the Portuguese steak and my sister's boyfriend got a striploin. Both said they loved it but took a significant portion home because neither could finish all the food on the plate. I also had some of mine to take home.

The service was also one of the best things about it. When I initially got there and was waiting for my family by myself, the host was very attentive and nice, and he even apologized for a baby that was crying for two seconds and said that normally doesn't happen. He was just really nice, we all thought so. He was attentive the entire time and fast too and he communicated the menu very well. He switched all our plates, cutlery, and (cloth) napkins between the round of appetizers and our main course, he also made sure we all had water all the time and noticed right away when anyone finished their drink and asked if they'd like another. He didn't get anything we asked for wrong or forget anything. We had a really nice experience.

I think the place is fairly new and the thing is that from outside, all you can see is the take out/lunch table type thing they have up front, but if you go inside you can see there's a nice looking restaurant in the back. I had walked by the place a thousand times and thought it was just a Portuguese take out place until I went that night and realized it was the same place. I hope this restaurant can get more business because they deserve it."}
{"text":"We went there some weeks ago, but Hollidays appeared, and well... Better late than never...

My husband saw the place in BlogTo, and mentioned that the pictures were succulent, I agreed, and kept thinking about that place.

It is easy, if you want to taste how an authentic, fresh, Argentinean/Uruguayan/Iberic steak, really tastes, this is the place. No waiting line (yet), no pretentions (in the take out area), and good wines, if you decide to dine in.

If you are a single carnivore who is still not confident to eat by yourself, you can go, pay less than 35 for a 2 meals steak size, with 2 garnishments of your option, and go home to enjoy. If you love real medium-rares without been medium, tiny, or the irony flavor... This is the place!!!

We ate there, and the service was amazing. There is a huge contrast in between the areas, but without doubt, the quality of the steaks overpassed our expectations."}
{"text":"The waiter was extremely polite, helpful, and attentive.  The food was fresh, and delicious.  The wine list was not great but definitely not an issue.  This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Gosh, where do I start?!?!? 

3 of us went there for lunch...Ordered a bottle of sparkling water, asked for lime.  Waiter came back twice to our table with NO lime after we reminded him about the limes.  We got lemons after the 3rd time.  

The 2 girls ordered clams.  Took 30 mins for them to arrive at our table and they were too salty and over-cooked.  Returned to the kitchen and reminded the waiter we are still waiting for our meals.

FINALLY, after 40 mins, the meals arrive.  The sirloin steak was amazing but I asked for rice and steamed veggies and got Chip fries.  Told the waiter about the error and he took my plate.  While the other two are eating their meal (cod with rapini and the other one had Ribs, salad and roasted potatoes), I am sitting their twiddling my thumb.  I walked up to the front where the kitchen is and see my steak plate sitting there on the counter.  I grabbed it and told the kitchen that I prefer not to eat my steak cold.  After 5 minutes, they brought the rice and steamed veggies to my desk.  Lets just say Thank God for the chip fries error because the steamed veggies were soggy.

Overall, the food was good minus the comments I made above but they really need better service and to perfect their dishes as they seem to be overcooking a few things.  The cod was tough, the veggies were soggy and no flavour, the clams were over-cooked.  

This place can do really well if they just focused on making it better!  Its a beautiful place and nice people aside from the waiter who didn't apologize for anything he did wrong. I don't see this place lasting long if changes won't be made."}
{"text":"Ossington and college is a hot spot in Toronto. This Friday night we came to Iberia Sur, enticed by the trendy sign and well light entrance and we were ushered to a table for six.

The restaurant was not full and our server brought us sparking water and some cocktails, a timid yet attentive waiter. The tables were far apart enough to talk shop, and not have to scream, a plus in today cramped dining venues. 

Onto the most important of part of this review, the food. The inspiration is here and, the taste is fresh. Take me back for the parriallada, the gran crux, a specialty of Argentine forefathers. A plate full of different meats, sausages and sauces truly delight. Chimicurri, blood sausage and sirloin are just a sample.

For two people our bill with tax and tip was $150 with several bottles of wine. I would return."}
