{"text":"Meh..Ok if you are hungry and the other restaurant at the airport did not serve you a drink after 10-15 minutes of taking the order. I'll skip both these next time."}
{"text":"Don't let the negative reviews steer you away!  The sushi here was so good and fast!  I had the seaweed salad in what was a very generous portion.  After the warm up, I had the spicy roll with Salmon.  Everything tasted so fresh.  The salmon was perfect and the veggies in the roll were perfectly crisp.  The price is very reasonable for CLT Airport.  The staff were professional and nice.  They also seemed to have a decent selection of wine and beer.  I heard the staff talking about the local and regional beers they carried.  Compared to a lot of airport food that is just okay, this place really stood out.  Located on concourse D on the right."}
{"text":"Initially I thought that the sushi was huge, well it is huge, a huge ball of rice with a very thin piece of fish. Wasn't very tasty and I simply felt ripped off because they artfully display the fish as if it was worth the $11.49. Go try something else in the airport."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty sweet! Antoine our waiter was on point! He had good suggestions and was really sincere. Would come back if I travel through CLT again."}
{"text":"I have to update my review by adding that they do have a menu and people can order made-to-order items and order drinks from the bar.  I should have read the other reviews before purchasing the cold, stale pre-made items left sitting in a cooler.   I was not impressed.   I guess the waiter went on break and the chef wasn't saying anything about the menu.  They need to eliminate cooler and just have made to order.

The area is nice.   Several lounge chairs and couches with tvs and wall plugs for recharging batteries.   There is a view of the runway and has top 40 music playing the background.    The airport offers unlimited free wifi (45 minutes at a time with no limit for more minutes).      Hissho is located in terminal D.    Worth checking out and waiting for the waiter to serve you."}
{"text":"Great food but needs faster and better waiters/waitresses. Took me 15 mins to get waited on and 20 mins for my food."}
{"text":"Had 20 minutes before a flight to Rio.  Asked them to make a quick order and in less than 5 we had made to order california, siracha, and eel rolls   They get a plus for service but sushi was just average.

Hard to expect a place in an airport terminal to be top notch, still it's better than fast food.

3 rolls about 6-9 pieces a roll. Bill came to $31 after tax not including tip.

3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Just okay - not sure if they do a la carte but when I visited it was basically like a pre-made supermarket sushi counter. Flavorful but not a GREAT sushi experience"}
{"text":"Okay for airport sushi. Tucked back behind D1, it's a cozy little place with bar seating and three small tables. 

Offers to go. READ OTHER REVIEWS BEFORE GETTING TO GO! 

Had the CLT roll... beware it does have a kick. The sushi seemed not fresh. Nothing was wrong but it just didn't melt in your mouth the way you expect good sushi to melt. Edamame was delish and Pinot Grigio is tough to screw up, very good! 

Prices are typical airport gouged prices but the portions are sizable."}
{"text":"It was good for airport food.  I enjoyed it.  No stove here. So go with raw only.  Chefs were great and onsite preparing."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to grab a quick bite of sushi at a decent price. Other amenities such as free WiFi are a plus. The staff is very friendly, and the food comes quick! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So bearing in mind this is Airport food, 5 stars . Fresh, reasonable and good service. Rivals most local sushi joints. Great service but to max sit at the bar ! Thanks fellow Yelper's. Another find"}
{"text":"Had the G&G Nagano twilight special for $11.99 plus $1 tax got the least tuna I've every had. It was sliced crazy thin. Can't kill them too much, getting fresh sushi in the middle of an airport in north Carolina can't be easy"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their sushi during my layover.
Nice selection of sushi, professional servers, good beers, and fast service!

Our waiter was so nice and fun. A good happy guy that really does his job with the kindest way.

I'll stop by again for sure"}
{"text":"This is a go to place to eat at, whether at the location or while on your flight.  Great selection and you see the cooks prepare the food before your eyes.  The sushi was excellent.  This is a restaurant you must visit.  Plus it's healthy for you.  This restaurant comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very expensive for sub-par sushi."}
{"text":"Literally the nicest and most genuinely kind waiter I've ever had (damn I'm gonna miss the south, NY can be jaded as hell)!  Not only was the service promot and pleasant, but the food was better than i expected.  

Although it wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, it was decent, which is more than i can say about any other airport sushi.  The only thing I didn't like about the was the heaviness of the rice; it was laid on real thick which made it hard to eat a piece without picking off some of the rice.  I had the CLT roll which was massive, and a little bit spicy.  The food prices are reasonable and the portions are hefty; however the wine is rather pricey ($9 for the house wine & $15 for the recommended Red).  My glass of vino was not served in a glass- but rather a plastic pyramid looking structure that definetly did not complement the wine."}
{"text":"5 stars for service , 4 stars for sake and 3 stars for Sushi. Average is 4 stars. That was the math part, now the review part, expectations of good sushi at airport did not exist so not disappointed there,  I was expecting them to carry good sake and pleasantly it was good. Service made the airport feel hospitable. Don't eat sushi without alcohol, especially at the airport"}
{"text":"I was flying in and out of the NYC area every week for about 7 months... This place was just ok sushi and the service was average.  Then I got to know the staff a little and the service became top notch and the wish even got average.  You looking for airport sushi come on in.  Say hi and be friendly!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a fair amount of sushi places around the world(I also live in Japan) and this is by far the worst sushi/sashimi place I have eaten at. I ordered the 9 piece sashimi(Chef's special) and 6 pieces of nigiri(tuna, salmon, and eel) and I must have received the lowest grade fish around. I am not familiar with Charlotte or North Carolina in general, but I am hoping this is not considered quality sushi by the population. I appreciate that the staff did not charge me for the orders. Please Yelpers, avoid this joint at all costs. If you're that hungry, I would even recommend the Burger King next door."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Concourse D nobody's there and once I found someone they were completely not helpful at all. They said they couldn't prepare anything for me I can only buy the pre-packaged selections. but then found another one in the atrium that was really yummy with great customer service"}
{"text":"Am sitting behind the restaurant right now eating my pre made spicy shrimp roll, and it's really good. I'm in an airport, and I'm eating pre-made sushi, so I'm not expecting it to taste like a 5 star restaurant. However, it does taste fresh and I'm happy I'm not eating fattening junk. I'm also happy I've found this secluded spot to get away from the crowd."}
{"text":"My go to sushi when I have time at the Charlotte International Airport. My favorite dish is the Tuna/Salmon chips.  Tuna or salmon is dressed with spicy sauce then place on top of whole grain chips.  I love the taste. It is always fresh as they are always busy. The menu is pretty good offering more than the typical airport choices. I haven't try the rolls but they all look very good. they offer quick carry out options as well. It is a little pricey but expected."}
{"text":"Good on the go option for the vegan (glutenfree) traveler. Vegetarian sushi and seaweed options to eat in or carry out. I only had a few minutes until boarding so I grabbed the seaweed salad ($6.50) to go. Tastewise it was actually quite good, however I would have appreciated less plastic wrapping and containers."}
{"text":"My friend and I BOTH got sick on the sushi - they claim is fresh but they switch the expiration stickers on the packages.  Stay away.  We only ate there because we needed something gluten free.  The overpriced sushi had BAD AVOCADO and served to customers."}
{"text":"Great price on sushi! Service is always good. Fish is always fresh. Not 5 stars because while the fish is fresh, it's quite lean -- so it's doesn't have the yumminess of fat.  Still love it and will go as often as I can."}
{"text":"Recommendations
1. Do not eat the take out sushi ( the rice feels like it's been sitting there for 1+ days. It was hard and chewy)
2. Do not eat any sushi with eel ( the quality of the eel was terrible. Parts of it were rubbery, totally inedible)"}
{"text":"This sushi joint is tucked away in the D terminal. I decided to eat here because of the modern furniture, good music, T.V.'s (playing the Little League World Series), and extremely warm greeting by staff (Jorge). I'm rating them a 3 Stars because I ordered the International roll, which had over cooked mushy rice, somewhat undercooked eel, and a spicy mayo that tasted like Miracle Whip with pink coloring. I would return for the atmosphere and good service alone. While I'm at it I'll get a Sapporo and give the rolls a second shot."}
{"text":"Went to the one in D terminal. It was late and so chill. The dude Jorge took so much interest and ownership in the service and making recommendations. He even changed the tv to the basketball game without having to ask. What a refreshing experience when most HMS host people don't give an eff or even know the menu. Sushi was good a bit expensive but definitely worth it if you're traveling for business."}
{"text":"Decent sushi in Charlotte.
I had the sushi lover ocean lover.
The fish was freshish.. but my yellow tail Nagiri was warm... Which is ok if they just killed the fish, otherwise it should be cold! The rice was nothing to write home about.
It was clean friendly and fast though, which is the key in an air port. 
Wicker Park at Ohare remains the standard for sushi in air port."}
{"text":"Man I wish I would have these reviews prior to ordering. The worst sushi ever! Granola bar here I come. Gagging."}
{"text":"There are two Yessho Sushi restaurants in the Charlotte Airport, I assume the main one is the one under the art installation showing every mode of flight in a fanciful way. We ate at the smaller one on Concourse D, and found the food fresh and quite good.  Although the California Roll was just fair, both of the other rolls we ordered were excellent--the Southern Charm (featuring snow crab, cucumber & avocado topped with eel sauce and not so authentic but tasty crunchy fried onions--fantastic), and Sushicado, (fish wrapped around avocado) choose from salmon yellowtail or tuna--salmon was lovely. Our waitress, Olivia  was sweet and helpful. Unfortunately, I couldn't give a 5 star rating due to the excessive amount of plastics/disposables used here-- EVERYTHING from the cups to the chopsticks, dipping bowls and plates! Just seems unnecessary. I'd happily raise the status to 5 if that were to change."}
{"text":"Found this place next to our gate before our flight.  We decided to eat here cause we saw the chefs making fresh sushi behind the counter.

Of course it's pricey cause it's in an airport but the sushi maki rolls we had were pretty good.  I had the Spicy Salmon maki and hubby got the spicy tuna maki.  Both had about 12 pcs and imagine about $0.75 per pcs!  Again airport prices.

The area we sat by looked modern and trendy.  It was a nice area to lounge around.

I'd go back again if my gate is near by.  It's nothing special but hey it's sushi on the go and it was made fresh so you can eat it there or bring it on the plane!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! I had the miso ginger salad and the southern charm roll. The salad had avocado piled on it and a refreshingly tasty dressing over a bed of actual lettuce (not iceberg garbage). My sushi roll was filled with chunks of real crab. It was much spicier than I was expecting, but still excellent and I would order it again. Plus, it didn't cost any more than I would expect to pay outside the airport. 

I'm glad I wasn't swayed by the negative reviews, as there's no way I could have eaten as delicious (and healthy) of a meal anywhere else in the airport. Most of the bad reviews deal with the pre-made items in the cooler, and a few mention the eel. I steered clear of both of those, and couldn't be happier with my decision. You should do the same!"}
{"text":"Sure they have pre-packaged sushi to grab & go (which is never the best no matter what you do) but at least you can see the people making it.  If you have the time, sit and dine at the counter where you know it is coming out fresh."}
{"text":"When my husband suggested Sushi at the airport, I did not have high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. We eat sushi often and we are very picky. The sushi rolls were excellent. The service was very good. She was very sweet and could do enough for us. I will go back whenever I am passing through Charlotte."}
{"text":"A surprise find in an airport.  Sushi is decent.  Their rice is a little bland, but the combination works. Love their fish & chip though.  Very delicious spicy sauce!"}
{"text":"For being sushi in the airport, it's pretty good. I try to order mine fresh and enjoy it. Ingredients could be better but I have not had a bad experience ordering from them."}
{"text":"So this isn't a great sushi restaurant, but it's quick and centrally located in the airport. They had a little fridge fully stocked with sushi to go. I hardly noticed the checkout stand, but the person at the bar quickly pointed it out. I got the salmon with avocado. It already had a generous portion of ginger and wasabi and a little packet of soy sauce inside. It was enough for my sushi, but I grabbed an extra packet anyhow. The sushi was nothing special, but it hit the spot, wasn't too expensive, and didn't make me sick. So if I was craving sushi and had to run though this airport, I might come back."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar. Order the miso ginger salad and 6 pc sashimi (yes they will substitute despite the menu saying otherwise) and cut it up. Dump the salad atop the sushi and mix. ($20) Order some wine. YOU'RE WELCOME!
Sincerely, 
The Airport Gourmet"}
{"text":"It's alright. But can't expect much from airport food. Pretty sure this is a chain with different names. Swear I've been to two or three other sushi places at the airport with the exact same menu."}
{"text":"I don't know how you ruin seaweed salad, but I could not finish it.   My salmon pokini was frozen in the middle and edamame wilted.  Could not believe it.  The sake , prebottled, was ok"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to stop in if it's not crowded. They have a large selection, everything I've ever had tasted fresh and good - hard to believe but true. The staff have always been very friendly and the service speedy - never had to worry about missing my connection!

The place has always seemed very clean no matter how busy they were and the prices are typical airport price!"}
{"text":"Yes this is inside the Charlotte Airport and yes it's getting 4 Stars. I'd even go 4.5 if I could. The only knock on this place is the seating. The food is great. The service is great. The price is a little pricey but let's face it your in the airport. I would recommend this place to anyone traveling through Charlotte that like sushi."}
{"text":"This place was an oasis amongst the desolate dessert of just bad fast-food.  Always fresh and not processed.  Makes me happy!!!!"}
{"text":"DON'T EAT AT HISSHO SUSHI!!!  Worst experience ever!!! I bought sushi from them and they would not even let me eat it in their restaurant!!!   They said since it was pre-made I had to sit somewhere else and there was no seats anywhere.  Their restaurant was completely empty.  The staff that was working had zero customer service skills. I ended up throwing all of my food in the TRASH because I was so disgusted by this restaurant.  TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!  STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED!!!"}
{"text":"We were here on a layover waiting to come back to Orange County, CA. We have plenty of sushi bars in the area, and to be honest we were not expecting much from this place. I was pleasantly surprised! Service was friendly, and fast. Fish was fresh, and prices were right. The only reason for 4 stars is the wasabi is a combination of gel and powder so it's not easily soluble in soy sauce"}
{"text":"Had about 30 minutes before my flight was boarding, and I was pretty hungry.  I hemmed and hawed about picking a place to eat, but figured, what the hell, airport sushi - I'm a masochist.  Suprisingly, it was much better than one would expect.

I ordered the First in Flight combo - spicy tuna roll, yellowtail nigiri, and spinach salad - and a burr.  The spicy tuna roll could have been a little bit spicier, but nothing some wasabi couldn't remedy.  The yellowtail was actually much better and melted in your mouth, I mean, my mouth.  Spinach salad was pretty standard except they serve up quite a bit of it.  All for $15 bucks, which I thought was pretty reasonable given (a) sushi, and (b) airport prices.

I overlooked the Shotgun Betty burrs that they had on tap.  It's a funky tasting beer, but so good.  It has a bubble-gum/banana taste... and it's so good, I promise.  Anyways, I think it's Lone Star Brewing or something like that, and they don't have a huge Charlotte presence AFAIK.  I'm glad that there are other places than Carolina Alehouse that carries it.  Now I can tell my buddy from Indiana about airport Bettys.

dmo out."}
{"text":"What a surprise!  Sushi was fantastic and the fish was fresh. Can't believe I am giving 4 stars to a sushi place in a airport, but they deserve it."}
{"text":"Airport food is overpriced. Agree. But this sushi place is nice and clean, with the option of picking a pre-made carryout dish or ordering fresh made from sushi bar if you want to dine-in. I had a chefs special roll, the oceans delight, and it was good, but was loosely rolled so some pieces of fish kept falling out and the seaweed broke in some places so I couldn't neatly dunk it in my soy sauce. But the tuna avocado roll was great. Fast service, cute atmosphere, and fresh fish. Good spot for sushi, I recommend."}
{"text":"Hostess has no idea what is going on, sushi did not look good; I didn't eat it. It is a busy location but bad even by airport standards."}
{"text":"Server was very sweet and kind thats the reason i give them to a 2 star... fish quality is so bad i think Albertson is better than here so its not worth the price and i think their sushi chef dont know how to make a sushi"}
{"text":"Who would have thought such a great sushi restaurant would be in an airport? The sushi quality and polite and speedy service are excellent. They also have a great selection of wine and local craft beers."}
{"text":"HisshoSushi's \"Blazing California Roll\" has distinctive flavors priced under $8. I was so impressed that reading the ingredients became an imperative (after my dinner/snack). That paprika-mayo-sesame seed combo was a winning choice for pollack, avocado and rice. Seductive flavors with depth should be sinful, especially at the airport. 

If you're flying through Charlotte, North Carolina the CarryOn Sushi Counter is a great idea. Healthy. Quick. Flavorful."}
{"text":"Had the miso soup and that was great and tasty. The gyoza pork came our not fried, and wasn't sure is gyoza suppose to be fried? In any case it was very good. The rolls had more fish than rice and that was great. Tasted fresh. I had the ocean roll. The ginger on the side though see less tasty and old. The wasabi was not a bright green but dull green, not sure why or was it too old? On any case I would eat there again. It's better than the fast food places, but it will cost some more as any other sushi place."}
{"text":"Good, quick option in Terminal D. I've been here a few times since my connections are frequently in Charlotte. There's ready-made grab & go rolls or just sit down for a quick bite. 

So, usually the two words \"QUICK\" and \"sushi\" don't go together but the reality is that you're in an airport and they realize that you don't have the luxury of time.  I watched the sushi chef prepare rolls and he's FAST. Like order your roll and you get your FULL order within 5 minutes type of fast. I also heard a person next to me ask how long it would take and he said he had to board in 15 minutes. That person ordered 2 rolls, ate and had the bill in less than that time!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some of the pre-made sushi before my flight that boarded in 10 minutes. The cashier asked me if it was to go, I said yes, but asked to sit down so I could eat a few bites before my flight. The extremely rude cashier said I couldn't sit down because my order was to go and said I could sit over at the general sitting area across the way. This was done even though there was at least 5 empty tables at the sushi place. I walked over to the general sitting area and realized they didn't offer me chop sticks, soy sauce or napkins. I had to walk back to the cashier station, gather those items and then hurry to eat the sushi outside my terminal. Worst yet, the sushi tasted like it had been made yesterday, being mushy and dare I say stale. Overall, a bad experience with terrible food. Next time I'll try any of the other quick to grab food available at the Charlotte airport. Perhaps the other establishments allow you to sit at their tables after buying their food."}
