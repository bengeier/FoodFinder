{"text":"A welcome edition to the overloaded Danforth restaurant strip in Toronto.  Looking for ordinary? Turn around and leave, this place is anything but ordinary. A warm feeling the moment I open the door. For me, I instantly wanted to stay. Rajeek greeted me with her most amazing smile you could just tell she was going to do what ever it takes to make it an enjoyable experience.  For lunch I had chicken fettuccini in a rosé sauce.  I wanted pasta but not a cream sauce so they threw this together for me (off menu) and it was amazing, I couldn't believe it. The chief came out and asked me if I liked it. How could I not given the effort they went through. For desert I had a mango pudding, so colorful and delicious but in keeping with the north American way, far too sweet, why so much sugar. They nailed service, presentation and selection. The bar has been raised on the Danforth, this is a café that cares. You're not just another Grande Verdi Mocha Iced Frapa Crapa in a red nondescript cup, you are treated like a VIP customer they want to come back and the will do what ever it takes."}
{"text":"Absolute Bakery is an absolute gem!!! Great addition to the neighbor hood. Amazing brunch and recently , also offering delicious dinner in a very cozy vibe. Don't be misled by the name. I highly recommend this family run restaurant !"}
{"text":"Lovely and bright bakery who's treats really bring the goods! Their pecan pies are big, tasty, and a bargain at the price. As are the fruit pies.  The crust on the pecan pie is tastier and a bit softer than others I've tried, which really sets it apart. Drop in if you're looking to fill that sweet craving with a slice of heaven."}
