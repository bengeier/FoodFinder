{"text":"I thought I knew what I liked in wine, but I was guided and encouraged to try new and different due to the many by-the-glass options not available elsewhere. The wine master, Michael, knows his stuff and pleased all in my party with his unusual recommendations. Cozy-cool ambiance is just right for romance or friends. Beer, whiskey, and cocktails can also be had, and great food for sharing (or not)."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and drink. All day Happy Hour on Wednesday makes the perfect spot for an after work hang out with friends."}
{"text":"What a special surprise. We had no idea the Wrigley Mansion was open to the public. The Wine bar was excellent and Michael was was so informative. We took our wine and wandered through the Mansion and saw the million dollar sunset. A must do for locals or out of towner's. 
Amazing it's right next to the Biltmore."}
{"text":"What a beautiful wine bar in the Wrigley Mansion!  We stopped in and enjoyed a flight of wine as well as shared a glass of Spotteswood Sauvignon Blanc - such a nice way to spend an afternoon!  Beautiful decor, chill atmosphere and a nice selection of wine to choose from."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  The wine bar is in a converted library at the Wrigley Mansion, a relatively small space, which gives it a great relaxing ambiance.  It would be good for a group or if you're on your own and just want to grab a drink and relax.

They've got a good selection of appetizers (order the meatballs) and the wine was great.  Michael is very knowledgeable about wine."}
{"text":"I was in here the other night and had a good time.  This small wine bar is located in the old library space in the Wrigley Mansion.  They have a well-curated selection of interesting wines.  In particular they have a system that allows you to have some really nice, expensive wines by the glass without buying the whole bottle.

Parking and valet are always a challenge at the Wrigley Mansion.  Also, it's too bad that there are no views of the Valley from the wine bar.  

They do have a good all night happy hour on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Michael is an amazing host/owner.  He is a pro who knows his wines.  My wife and I can't wait to come back. The bar food was also excellent,especially the pork belly!"}
{"text":"My lady and I were recently enjoying a few days of golf and general debauchery in the Biltmore Area of Phoenix Arizona. While we had previously checked out the Wrigley Mansion .... we had never visited the relatively new lounge .... Jamie's Wine Bar. We had a few minutes mid-day Saturday, so we decided to drive up the hill.

As always, on a clear day, the view from the main entrance of the mansion was spectacular. This is true despite the fact that from that vantage point, I could see and was reminded of a hole on the Biltmore Golf Course (\" The Links Course\") that caused my grief the day before ... oh well. 

Jamie's Wine Bar was a relatively small area, near the main entrance, just outside a portion of a dining room. It provides for both table and bar seating.

The Wine Bar offers an extensive list of fine wines by the bottle and 20 or so by the glass. Prices were competitive and the service was top notch. We will return,"}
{"text":"Loved this place and hope no one else finds it!  Been here 27 years and just found it...membership has its privileges!  Go for the Croque Madame as she leaves you very satisfied and the Populus is the Prisoner killer."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!  Service is great and a great ambiance of the mansion is the perfect compliment to an outstanding evening"}
{"text":"Loved our short visit.  Dylan, our server, was personable and knowledgeable (and a hoot!).  Got the 'social membership' so valet cost will be covered after one more trip.  I'm a little happy that so many people don't how what a fabulous spot Geordie's is for food, drink and the view...and now Jamie's.  Wow.  Visit and enjoy but don't spread the good news around."}
{"text":"This is an awesome new wine bar to hit the Central Phoenix location. Prices are spot on along with the food and killer happy hour menu. The design and ambiance of the bar is unbelievable, this place is perfect for the neighborhood. Come check it out and meet Micheal the wine expert, you will not regret it. This wine bar is located inside the Wrigley Mansion, use the valet service."}
