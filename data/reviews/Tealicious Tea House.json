{"text":"i was trying to show my friend the worst bbt place i had on Facebook but found that they deleted the page or block me or whatever (couldn't search). Wrote a review on their Facebook page month ago, worst place ever. ordered green tea almond slush, drink itself was okay, what I don't like was the attitude and poor customer service. I WILL NEVER COME BACK!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing food.  Ordered the popcorn chicken and the BBQ chicken wings along with 2 drinks.  The drinks took forever to arrive, and the food took forever plus a night to get to our table.  The \"BBQ\" wings were clearly the frozen ones you get from grocery stores, soggy skin and all.  Definitely would not return."}
{"text":"My First time here. Initial plan was to grab a quick bubble tea and head out. But was pleasantly surprised by how cool this shop was. Walls filled with games and awesome collection of toys. Also, my friends and I were treated very well even for a mere takeout order. Drinks were made fast, and would highly recommended. I will definitely be back to enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Me and my friends have enjoyed coming here to hang out and talk.
What the owner did last night, was a huge shock to all of us. At some point, we were asking each other if we tipped them, and we are certain we did.

We celebrated a birthday last night, each one of us ordering a drink, in a group of 12 people. We brought in a cake, and we asked the waitress to bring use forks and plates. She willingly did. We paid, we tipped, and we left when another group of 10 people entered the restaurant (as the restaurant did not have enough tables for them). We left so that the group could have enough room.

After going outside to decide how everyone is getting home, we saw the owner open the door and throw something out. We turn around and see that he threw our cake out into the streets.

He could have waited until we left. He clearly does not know how to keep his customers happy. The 12 of us witnessed it happen, and we are all pleased to say, we will not be returning to this bubble tea place. Customer service is the most important aspect about doing business and to rudely throw it out, was just a disgrace.

We could have stayed and made the group of 10 cram into the table they had set up for them, but no, we decided to leave and give them more space. It was very unfortunate that this happened, and I hope that it never happens to anyone else. We even offered the staff cake, but they did not want any."}
{"text":"It's a cozy place. The servers are always nice for the times I've been there. 
I've had a few of their drinks - given the great number of choices, I didn't expect all to be good: the slushes tasted a bit too sweet. I really like their rose milk tea though (looks awesome in the to-go cups).

I don't have high expectations for food at such a small tea place, so I don't generally order them. I've only had the green-tea-flavored thick toast (which was decent) and the cheesecake platter. The cheesecakes are like the squared little ones you can get from Costco, which means they taste okay but nothing special. 

In general I'd recommend it if you are looking for a place to chat or study (it's usually quiet and the lighting is pretty good/not so dark as Go-for-Tea's, so I suppose it's actually a nice place for studying)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing to just chill and have a good time with friends. Came to this tea house at 6:00-7:30PM after a sports tournament and the music and service was nice. They had raised the price up too :/

Told the server our order which was 4 Sunday special (Strawberry Heaven )  and it was only avaliable in a large but that was fine and we also got popcorn chicken as a snack. For myself I ordered condensed milk toast but on a separate bill. 

Strawberry Heaven-- it was pretty good for a large drink, $4.99. However it was really foamy at the top and it was a little bitter which was more bitter than I prefer because it was a green tea base. What it tastes was like strawberry kitkat but a little less sweet. Was a big glass though!! 

Popcorn chicken-- was amazing! However portion was a little small for $5.50 ish I believe. Nice seasoning and came with sweet chili sauce 

Condensed milk toast-- I had to remind my server to bring me my toast but other than that the food was good. It was sweet, warm and it tasted a bit like coconut which was unusual... Nice plating though! 

Overall, the store is a bit small but the couch area was comfy, clean and the variety of games is fairly big. Their display of toys is cute! 
Side note: a lot of the games are Chinese or have Chinese instructions but some do have little English basic instructions. 
WOULD DEFINETLY COME HERE WITH MORE PEOPLE!!"}
{"text":"I usually come here Friday nights. They have a pretty small establishment, but they still manage to fit a lot when our group of 10 comes on Friday so I wouldn't be too worried. Drinks are pretty good and their food is okay for a bubble tea place. Prices are comparable to other places. They have card games and small board games like monopoly deal and uno! And... won't make you wait till midnight to play

Overall, if you're looking for a place to hang out and drink some bubble tea and the 'popular' places are full, test this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on an early afternoon to sit and talk. The cafe was completely empty, but given the time of day on a weekday I was not surprised. The board game selection there is average, many games being worn from usage. Luckily my friend and I are simple people and Exploding Kittens was enough to pass our two hour block with ease. The drinks themselves are good, however there was a hair found in my friend's. The host was quick to remake her drink when we told him about it."}
{"text":"-Tapioca wasn't that fresh.
-Hot tea was expensive for a mug ($5-6), and was overly bitter. 
-Service wasn't that welcoming either. Instead of asking us if we were ready to order, they just stood there beside us."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, and it was just a quick in and out for bubble tea if I'm visiting NCIX right next door.

Nothing too special, but I remember seeing a bunch of board games and magazines which I assume is more fun if you're visiting Tealicious in a group.

The bubble tea is good, but nothing to really rave about. 

I decided to be fair with my review though since I never really had the full experience here."}
{"text":"I think I've come to a realization about why we don't have a lot of independent coffee shops in the GTA, it's because here in the burbs, we rock Bubble Tea spots pretty hard, and we kick have some spots that kick some serious ass. Tealicious on the Scarborough/Markham border is a prime example of this Bubble Tea ass kickery!

Great friendly service, clean venue, fast reliable FREE WiFi and lots of couches, outlets and tables to either lounge at or so work from. All this in addition to all your fave flavours of bubble tea in both Milk and Juice options. Fairly standard for most spots but all the other x-factors of this place are what lead me to add a better than average review.

They're located just north of Finch within a great plaza so keep your eyes open for their green sign when cruising the parking lot"}
{"text":"Food 2.5/5  (weighed at 50% of final score)

Having ordered the Taiwanese Sausage ($5.49), I've learned that the snacks are edible, but nothing extraordinary. The portion was about .75 cup of thinly sliced sausages. The drinks were also palatable, but, again, not something that I would feel is remarkable (I ordered a Special Matcha Milk Tea with Tapioca and No Sugar).The tapioca in my drink was strange- too mushy on the outside and under-cooked on the inside. In general, the snacks are pretty standard, nothing I would visit the place again for. This is not a place for a meal (though they do have a few entr√©e items offered at an equally unjust quality and price), but greasy snacks (which have an allure of its own, but not particularly from this place).

Ambiance 2.5/5 (weighed at 15% of final score)

It was summer afternoon when I went, so it was warm outside as is. The moment I stepped in it felt like a sauna. The AC, for whatever reason, wasn't on. I only give it a passing score for the past few times when I went and the temperature was acceptable. Perhaps due to the humidity in the store, it also felt dirtier than usual. The Wii that they have there gave the place a very chill feeling. A place to hang out with friends as a group, maybe, but not a date spot. The place is also relatively small, so I would not recommend this for groups more than 8.

Service 2/5 (weighed at 15% of final score)

I joined my friends later, but that doesn't give them an excuse to not hand me a menu. I feel that it is the least they can do to hand me a menu within 5 minutes when I first arrive. When asked to explain what the difference between the \"special matcha milk tea\" ($5.99) and \"matcha milk tea\" ($4.45) is, they couldn't really explain in much detail and simply replied \"The powder is different.\" I asked whether that made the more expensive one better, and they simple muttered a \"Yeah.\" Not impressive product knowledge to say the least. The service provided felt like the don't-bug-me-and-I-won't-bug-you type.

Cost 2/5 (weighed at 10% of final score)

For the quality of everything within the store, it was on the expensive side. Not that worth it. I would much prefer to spend a few more dollars for a nicer place like GoForTea or Destiny, if not the neighbourhood-friendly Chatime across the same plaza with the slightly lower price range.

Other 1/5 (weighed at 10% of final score)

I use this category as a brownie point category while summarizing. The overall experience was slightly below average, but the place does have a TV with a Wii (Mario Kart and Super Smash Brawl, anyone?), some board games, and some card games. So props to that.

Side note is that they only accept debit card payments when your personal total bill is over $10. They do not accept credit cards. I did not deduct any points for this, although it is slightly inconvenient, because it isn't completely strange for bubble tea places like these to have the Over $10 rule. You cannot bring outside food in, even if it's not offered on their menu, and the number of drinks/items ordered must at least equal to the number of guests at the table.

Final Score: 44.5/100 = 2 Stars

Unlikely to go back there by myself, or recommend to others, unless my friends go there for a casual hangout."}
{"text":"Great taro and coconut milk tea! Only place in town I've been that offers this combo. Keep coming back for it!"}
{"text":"Pretty mesmerized by the positive reviews for this place. I ordered the kit kat bubble tea, and my friend got the oreo one. I was really excited cause I've never heard of Kit Kat bubble tea before. I first imagined that they would merely try to mimic the flavours of a kitkat, but instead they merely ground the kit kat bar with the tea, which made the drink really a terrible experience, with soggy kit kat bar bits at the bottom of my glass. Same goes with the oreo one my friend ordered, again it was just blended oreo in tea. However, though I didn't order food, the tables around us did and it looked pretty appetizing and at a really cheap price. Plus I generally enjoy all places that I can lounge around in, and play games for free. Waitress was also very friendly and fluent in English for a change! Would have been a 2.5 for my drink, but boosted up for looks of food, games, and good service. Hopefully other drink items are better when I return another time."}
{"text":"I feel that everytime I go here, I get a different experience. 

I usually go here during happy hour (3pm-7pm) when its usually empty and aside from the crappy music they continuously repeat over and over again, it's a good place to study or hang out.    

Tealicious offers a variety of bubble tea, slushies, yogurt drinks, etc.. Their menu is quite extensive from cold and hot drinks on one side and food and desserts on the other. 

I really like the bubble tea here, the drink itself doesn't have powderly crap (or that much) and actually tastes sweet compare to Go for Tea just up north of Midland. To be honest, it's one of the best bubble teas in Scarborough.. 

However food wise, it's a mixed bag. The only good thing in the menu is the minced beef on rice (with kimchi and egg) and doesn't taste like its been thrown into a microwave like most of the items on the menu.
I guess since they don't really have a \"kitchen\" like their competitor, Tea A Break, or that none of the staff could actually cook. 

One thing that I like about this place is the free wifi which is high speed or at least faster than other cafes and coffee shops like Starbucks. 

Like other yelpers mention, the service here is terrible, especially the owner who constantly insults me behind my back even though i constantly leave a good 15% tip everytime. 

... I feel that if I did not tip them I would get the same exact crappy-ass service which befuddles me. I mean seriously, if I give them a bad tip they crap on me for it but when I don't give them anything, they don't.. whatever... /rant

Plus the place smells weird...."}
{"text":"Didn't have the best service. They told us to leave when we were in a middle of a game. They said it's because we originally said we were to go. But there was no one else there, so we thought it would be nice to stay for a bit. Obviously not.

I got the milk bubble tea, it was really basic, nothing special. 

Probably won't come again."}
{"text":"Oreo milk tea is so bomb. It would have been perfect with a bit of tapioca but I had ordered without. I tried their taro red bean slush too which was good. The kit Kat milk tea, I would have wanted more kit Kat flavor. I like how their drinks are not as sweet as some other bbt places. Service is great, and their daily specials are affordably priced at $3.99. To be honest, I like how there's not a lot of people during the weeknights and appreciate the quietness without a crowd. I've never been there on weekends, so I can't comment on that. Give them a try today, you might be surprised! I still need to try their matcha milk tea... Mmmm :)"}
{"text":"I've have been here before small and quiet place, I noticed that the service was quite slow. This time around I ordered my drink to go, service was quicker than the last time but unfortunately the tapioca was undercooked. The tapioca is what I look forward to so needless to say I was quite disappointed with my drink."}
{"text":"A small simple little place with decent prices and a clean, cheerful atmosphere. This is a great hang out from my two visits. The staff are fast and friendly and the food is of good quality and selection for a low price."}
{"text":"Their bubble tea is not bad but their service is terrible! There are much better options just walking distance away!

Came in here with some friends because the line at Chatime was too long and we figured we might as well give this place a try.  

The inside is nice, couches to sit on with tables so it's great for going with a few buddies.  We sat and decided to order just bbtea.

The service was terrible.  They were slow to take our order even though we were the only group there that hadn't ordered already.  The wait for the bubble tea was maybe 15 minutes! And what was the point of having them seat you and take your order if you have to pay at the front anyways?

The bubble tea and venue were good, but for the wait, the slightly higher price, and poor service, this place gets a very light 2/5."}
{"text":"Great staff! Clean and modern interior. Had Kit-Kat bubble tea and Taro-Coconut bubble tea, something I have never seen or tasted before. Both were delicious and competitively priced with other big name tea places. I would definitely go back to try more flavours.

Note: 20% off when doing takeout orders.
       : You get a card that can accumulate stamps that go toward a free drink."}
{"text":"Like the takeout minced pork on rice and popcorn chicken.  20% off for takeout. Really a good deal! The original bubble tea is decent."}
{"text":"Not bad for my first visit. A small bright homey feel with comfortable clean couches. Came in a group of 11+ and played our own board games. They have a small selection of board games, magazines and even Wii. 

Malt Milk Tea was good, crispy malt flakes, but too sweet. The server overheard me telling this to my friend and insisted on making me a new drink, even though I had already drank 1/3. Thank you for good service rarely seen in bubble tea shops/Asian places!

I liked the Passionfruit Juice with Aloe (half sweet). The Apple Oolong is not bad, roasty flavor with a hint of apple. 

Only complaint is that it was very stuffy."}
{"text":"Compared to other places in the Scarborough & Markham area, they have a really unique menu for bubble tea. There are also set daily specials for every day of the week. My favorite one is the green tea almond slush which includes tapioca in the price. The prices are decent too. Food is just okay but also pretty decent for the price. When you sit in and buy bbt here u can also get stamps to redeem free bbt for takeout which is an awesome perk. They also play great music."}
{"text":"Visited Tealicious on a Saturday evening, group of three. Smaller place with couches, and half booths (2 bench seats, 2 chairs) We got there around 7:00pm and it wasn't very crowded. The hostess/waitress welcomed us with a big smile. We were able to choose our own spot. (It did get pretty packed as the night progressed, and closer to 10pm about 90% of the seats were filled.)

The menu has a big variety of hot and cold drinks. We had fun choosing a few different things to try. The hot milk teas were our fave, especially the taro and matcha hot tea.

They also had some cool little snacks on the menu. We high recommend the \"popcorn chicken\" which was nothing like what were expecting, but in the best way! What we got was a very generous portion of juicy, tasty, battered, deep fried chicken tenders. Soooooo amazing and drool worthy! We ordered a second batch to snack on as we played a few of their games. 

Most of the games they have are in Chinese! If you don't read Chinese then there are still some board games and card games that you can choose from. I'd suggest that if you want to go and enjoy games, go with a group of at least 4 people, as the 3 of us had a hard time playing board games because we didn't have enough people. 

One major turn off for me was the bathroom. I'm super picky about the cleanliness of bathroom facilities, and this really fell below the bar. The women's bathroom was one single room, which is suitable for an establishment this size, but it was so horribly dirty. The floors, the walls, the sink... just filthy as if it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Plus, all of their cleaning supplies were just scattered all over the place as if it kind of doubled as a broom closet. 

ANYWAY, it's a cute spot to go and enjoy a good variety of Tasty drinks, fun snacks and play some games. Just maybe avoid the bathroom? LOL"}
{"text":"We dropped by for after supper drink.  We ordered a Lychee Calpis Milk Tea with jelly and a Matcha Milk Tea with tapioca, which was the daily special.  We did not ask for any change in sugar level.  Let's just say I was glad that the beverages were not too sweet, which to me is an ultimate sin for milk tea.  I am aware that this is an old fashioned, personal preference of how tea/milk tea is.  

This is no Green Grotto; the venue is furnished in a grown up way.  The sofa is comfortable; the wallpaper tasteful, the lighting bright.  The place does not try to look cute or adorable.  The background music is at times elevator music or jazzy rock.  Overall, it has a lounge vibe but not dark/dim, sexy or alcoholic.  

Despite the style, the patrons this evening were mostly college students.  I guess I have to accept that students are the main BB tea consumers.  On the other hand, I am still glad that on top of coffee shops and lounges, I can go to grownup bubble tea places for after supper drinks now."}
{"text":"Just your regular boardgame cafe, but with a touch of friendly service. 

There is a minimum purchase at the store when you sit down, if you want to save money just get the daily special for $3.99. The drink was average, not as good as regular bubble tea shops, but then again, you pay for playing the boardgames there.

The store is quite small actually, probably can sit around 5 different groups of people. There are 4 large couches to sit on if you at the right time. The selection of boardgames is kinda limited, but they do have the boardgame cafe staples such as poker, uno, ma jeong, monopoly, and san guo sha.

The servers/owners are quite friendly, you can definitely have a nice chat with them and if it's not too busy they would even play a little boardgames with you."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place; down to the cool transformers action figure that was displayed on the front counter. The Nerd in me has resurfaced. It was a really cool action figure. Never seen one so big and it reminded me of the good old days where kids played with action figures instead of their tablets and phones.

Anyway, service was amazing even though we were the only customers there on a Friday afternoon. The apple honey tea we got for $6.99 was never empty and the guy filled it three times. I had to take a major leak afterwards...lol. The apple honey tea was very sweet for a tea but I really liked it and it wasn't overly sweet.

Also got a condensed milk toast for $4.49 which was awsesome. Bread was super thick and the top layer had like a cookie crumble of some sort and drenched with condensed milk. For the road I also got a pudding milk tea for $4.49. Not what I was expecting because I thought there would be actual pudding with milk tea but instead it was a pudding flavoured milk tea. Not too bad but I would prefer actual pudding."}
{"text":"Small bubble tea spot that's clean and plays good music! This place can get pretty busy sometimes but otherwise they have board games and special drinks combination of drinks and comfy sofa/booth seating"}
{"text":"Expensive and mediocre boba that's not even worth coming too, I rather goto chatime and pay a lil more for quality boba"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been returning customers to Tealicious ever since it opened at this location. We have always enjoyed the nice atmosphere and good service.

What happened was a big disappointment today, and me and all of the 25 or so friends that we have introduced to Tealicious will never come back again.

My group of 10 friends visited Tealicious today to celebrate a birthday, and we brought cake with us. Everyone ordered a drink, everyone paid, we tipped, and we left in 2 hours. We offered the staff some of the cake since we knew we couldn't finish it, but the waitress politely refused. Everything was fine until my friends and I were leaving, and the owner of Tealicious took our leftover cake and THREW IT OUT ON THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF US. He did not put it in the trash, he just threw it onto the middle of the sidewalk.

This left my friends and I all very shocked and disappointed to see such rude service. I am especially saddened to know that I will not be able to come back to this place again, since I have created some great memories here.

If bringing in cake from outside was a problem, they should have let us know instead of bringing us a knife, forks, and plates for the cake.
If leaving the leftover cake was a problem, they should have told us to take it with us and we would have done so without a complaint.

Having experienced this horribly rude behavior coming from the OWNER of this tea shop, I strongly recommend that one does not visit this place for fear that this happens to another group of unsuspecting customers."}
{"text":"Tried their food selection (which is very limited) and ordered Taiwanese Sausage with rice. The saugage was delcious and the rice, egg, with veggies were not bad either. I was impressed with the quality of the food from a bubble tea place.

It does take quite a while to come compared to the buuble tea though!

The black tea lattle was awesome as well."}
{"text":"I believe in supporting local businesses, but their drinks are not that good. Do not get the kit kat special, it tastes like watered down chocolate. 

Their food is pretty good though. Especially the popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"Tldr: Great selection of your favourite bbt beverages, has board games in-house, meh service, good prices but mediocre taste and quality 

Came here for the first time on a Sunday afternoon just to chill with a couple of friends to play board games and enjoy some bbt. Tealicious has a pretty good selection of flavored ice teas, milk teas, slushes, juices and even hot teas in pots. 

I ordered a regular green milk tea with the addition of grass jelly. I thought it was just ok. Too much milk flavor and not enough tea flavor in my opinion. The grass jelly was nothing out of the ordinary either so not sure if it was worth adding the extra dollar. 

Within this plaza, this place was the only location that had board games in-house. I'm not the biggest board game fanatic, but my friends did say their selection was ok. The prices were pretty low compared to the other sit-down/board game bbt joints in the area, but personally i think the quality and taste of their drinks are at a lower level. 

The service was meh. There was only one guy working and the drinks took quite some time to get here since there was 6 of us. To order, we went to him at the bar (He was just sitting there) instead of him coming to us. After getting our drinks he didn't really follow up or asked if we needed anything else. He wasn't very friendly but wasn't super rude either. He just looked like he hated being there. Idk...maybe it's a side ting for him lol. 

Overall, i don't think there's anything special about this place. They're not particularly good at being a board game spot or a bbt joint. So would i come back?.. Probably not anytime soon"}
{"text":"Decided to try this pace out because the Chatime line up was too long of a wait. Was a bit sceptical at first because it wasn't very busy. Just one group of customers playing board games. They did have a selection of board games to choose from and a big enough selection of drinks to choose from. I ordered a mango juice with aloe Vera. The mango juice is very viscous, not a thick nectar or pulpy. The aloe Vera chunks are quite big. Tapioca sized cubes. I quite liked my drink. And the bonus! One of the reasons why it might be empty is because you get a discount for take out. Come get a drink and get the hell out of here. Haha."}
{"text":"Tealicious Tea House Grand Opening Today!

Yes, it may be just another Bubble Tea place, but I have to say the drinks are much better prepared and taste so much better than Tea Shop 168 and Destiny.

Buy one get one free special today, so I ended up trying:

Sesame Flavoured Hot Milk Green Tea ($3.99) which is rich/smooth and full of sesame...drink even like a milkshake but definitely not sickening sweet!

And for my free drink, how can I say no to free? Mandarin Orange Lemon Iced Black Tea ($3.99, free today) is also nice and refreshing for today hot weather!

Great set up, free wifi and friendly staffs! A little hectic today because of the Opening Day's Specials. 

Definitely will be back and chill out a little and try out other things in the menu!!

20% off for Takeout!"}
{"text":"I tried to love this place.. but no. To start off, my friend and I decided to come here for bubble tea. Upon arrival, we were seated, however the waitress didn't come up to us for a good 15 minutes. After asking for our order, we both decided to go for the mango slush, and I specifically asked her for tapioca. Her response was \"sorry, I'm not sure what that is.\" We were both super confused.. anyways she's like I have to ask the people who make it if we do. She comes back like 10 minutes later and says yes we do, before she walked away, we both asked her for water. TAKE IN, we did not get a single cup of water until we left. We were probably there for about 45 minutes-1 hour. SO disappointed, and we asked her twice.

The mango slush w/ tapioca tasted pretty good. We both enjoyed our drinks. 

P.S. this place has games, so you can play while you eat/drink.

I've always wanted to try this place out, but after this experience.. I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I keep coming here, and we haven't figured out why yet, but maybe it's because of the general relaxed vibe this place has. There are figurines in the corner and games on the side for customers to play. Seating is alright depending on the size if your group. 

The menu is pretty extensive for a bubble tea place and the presentation is pleasant. Strangely enough, I like their sodas. 

There isn't much to say. Come here and try this place out."}
