{"text":"Food here was not too bad. Although the service could be better. Not enough staff working even though the boss  running around like crazy is super friendly and helpful. But with that many customers during lunch time, additional staff could greatly improve the service!"}
{"text":"Worst Xi'an restaurant I ever had! I will never ever come back again. I ordered The eggplant. It was so sweet, all I can taste of was sugar. The kou shui chicken, when they served it, it already looked like a left over. I don't normally say the *taste* of a restaurant is really really bad. But this one has definitely a bad taste. Not to mention the service sucks. Only one waiter in the whole restaurant so he forced ppl to sit closer to him instead of where they want to sit. When I pay, I forgot to use my coupon, he refused to take it afterwards and say we have to come back. I'm not gonna do that!!!! Please don't say you are a Xi'an restaurant since you are definitely not eligible to be one. Just a shame for xi'an!!! Ppl shouldn't come!!! The other shaanxi restaurant in Scarborough is much better!!!"}
{"text":"Eminently reasonable prices, good attitude, average service on busy times, but restaurant could benefit from a serious hygiene overhaul and regular cleaning.   Tables, seats and hot pot stove controls feel sticky, as if they haven't been wiped in a while. Stove plate coverings are thrown to the floor when they serve and placed back on tables when you first come in. Condiments rack is disheveled. Raw meat quality and maintenance has dropped since my last visit.   I couldn't enjoy my meal despite the droves of customers enjoying Shaanxi's alternate offering of north-central Chinese delicacies.  The lady owner is as friendly and welcoming as the first day she opened. We wish her the best and hope she improves on sanitary conditions, which are critical when serving raw food in a hotpot place."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group to try out some Xi'an food.  Didn't have the hotpot, but ordered ala carte.  Having visited Xi'an a few months back, we were looking forward to some authentic northwestern food.  Had a few versions of the wide hand made noodles and all were delicious.  Lovely chewy texture, nicely seasoned even without the spicy sauce added.  The round bread that was already torn and mixed in their rich soupy broth was delicate and hearty.  Other dishes were well done too, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Shaanxi is a Chinese restaurant for Chinese people.  Don't bring your foreigner friend here because they will not have the palate to appreciate most of the food here. It's very ethnic, I'm surprised they even had English on the menu. I'm not being prejudice, but I don't have the patience to explain every dish and try to convince Billy Smith to try the pig lard jello, or the plasticine like noodles.   I don't know whether in Shaanxi (the Province) hot pot is popular, but it is one of the things on the menu. I am from somewhere in China where I'm supposed to love hot pot, but I didn't develop that habit. This is very much a hole in the wall in on random street in Shaanxi type of restaurant in a Markham Plaza. The food is what the local Shaanxi people have for lunch. Bowl of thick noodles, fat jello, pan fried bread with grounded cumin meat, lamb skewers. Heart food for the rustic appetite. Simply, this is food for the lower to lower middle class who work for a living. When I am in China and I want to treat a migrant worker or cap driver a meal, I don't take them to some fancy restaurant, I take them to a restaurant with the food similar to Shaanxi Restaurant and buy the whole menu for the price of a Big Mac.   The lady here always put her hands on me when suggesting a dish, or talking to me just a general. I don't mind, because I know from the cleanliness of the washroom that she and this restaurant is definitely sanitary.    The first thing the lady here told me was the password for the WIFI, and I didn't have a beanie on!"}
{"text":"0 service here. My soda never came and I was charged for it.  When I paid for my bill, I never got my change back... I am Chinese and I go to Chinese restaurants on a regular but this service is next level low."}
{"text":"This place is my go to place with my friends when we want to have spicy food. We stumbled in here randomly and have been coming back over and over. I only go here when I'm with my friends though because they can speak Mandarin and I can't. The waitresses only speak Mandarin and basically look upset at you if you can't.   You are basically given the menu to look at and you write down the items you want on a piece of paper. We tend to get around 1 big spicy fish pot with bean sprouts and 5 small dishes. We have our staple items and we don't stray far from it. The food is really flavourful, quite spicy but then again I'm a wimp. They do have non spicy food as well. Their chinese hamburger buns are really good too!   The prices are fair too. Between 5 people each of us only pay about $14.50 including tip and tax. The food gives this place 3 stars but the service and attitude keeps the score at a 3.   Would I come back? Yes but only with someone who can speak mandarin. sigh They also have 3 big round tables for groups."}
{"text":"The food is pretty tasty and there are a lot of selections if you are a fan of spicy food, although almost everything is very oily. We ordered five dishes for three people, the prices are average and ran us about $14 per person. I especially liked the cold noodles and ended up ordering take-out for lunch next day, which was not a bad idea as they kept well overnight. I would come here again if I was craving that northwestern China spice, but probably not without the friend who spoke Mandarin and ordered for us."}
{"text":"In this plaza there are 4 northern Chinese restaurant. We had lunch here with 2 other friends. I order the ma po tofu rice. There was so much oil on it. The tofu basically drowning in the oil. There wasn't much taste either. My other friend order the friend rice noodle. When it came it was egg noodle. We thought we order wrong so we checked the menu. We didn't order wrong so we ask the owner why they make the wrong noodle. She said they ran out of rice noodle so we assume you are ok with egg noodles. Wtf??? At least ask us first before you cook it. They were trying to be nice and ask if we want to change it but no point and waste the food. Bad judgement. No interest of this restaurant again. Food isn't that good any way. Too much oil on everything. I guess norther Chinese food are all like that. Oil oil oil"}
{"text":"I ordered spicy boiling fish, dan dan noodles, stir-fried beef and a cup of soy milk. The best tasting and only thing with any flavour is the soy milk. The spicy boiling fish is literally plain, bland fish soaked in oil. Worst Sichuan food in Markham yet. Save your time and money, go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Driving by and needing a quick lunch for my wife and I. Our choice was almost random, but it worked out very well.  At lunch the have a special which includes soup, greens, steamed rice and a main for $ 7.99. The first 3 items are replenished at no extra charge.  This was a slightly different cuisine. It Northwestern Chinese cooking, well prepared and just a little oily. Just that tipped the balance to 3 stars.  For starters, the soup was bean curds and kiwis. Interesting combo, but a bit bland. It was better spiked with a bit of vinegar.  As mains we ordered Pork with chilies and Beef  with onion and fungus. Both were tasty, hot, and plentiful.  For a quick lunch it hit the spot. We will return here to sample more of  this style of cooking."}
{"text":"I have to up the score a bit. The food is consistently on point, service is friendly, and you can't beat the price.   The lunch menu at $7.99 has become my fave, all of the meals are full of flavour and spice. They come with rice, a veggie and a soup. Overall, it's a satisfying meal. I'll usually have the Shredded Pork with Garlic, or the Ma Po Tofu."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb. Probably the most authentic Shaanxi food you can get in the GTA or even Canada. Some dishes that stood out where:  shao zi noodles liang pi (cold noodles?) Rou jia mo (chinese hamburgers?)   Shaan xi food is known to be extremely flavourful and this restaurant does not disappoint. If your craving for a bowl of spicy noodles or chinese hamburgers this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"So happy they opened up a new location in Richmond Hill, the size of the restaurant it's small, around 10 tables, the serving is fast and efficient. Highly recommend to try their sha xian wonton, the texture of the wonton it's different than other places, it doesn't have shrimp in it. Really good. If you don't have allergy, try their peanut noodles."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the absolute all-time best Xi'an style food we have had in Canada.  The restaurant itself:  Beautiful mural on the wall, reminded me so much of western China.  The furniture - chairs are beautifully engraved/carved.  Now:  the food.  EXQUISITE:  The braised lamb was served piping hot - in a thick, luscious, rich and flavorful sauce.  Lots of hot chili peppers.  VERY LA.  Mmmmmmm.  The lamb was cooked to perfection - tender, flavorful - perfect bite size for the chopsticks.  Fell off the bone.  Mmmmmm.  Perfect ratio of vegetables, glass noodles and lamb ... *sigh*  Shredded pork mian-bao.  Bread not heavy, pork cooked to perfection.  Use some of the chili oil on the table and it is just divine.  The dry fried beans with garlic, meat and tons of hot chili peppers was an absolute perfect accompaniment to this gastronomic experience.  This place was a real find.  What an amazing restaurant.  We ordered well and were not disappointed.  Only thing - I wish they had a couple of tea choices.  Waitress was borderline indifferent to us - first time customers - maybe we'll get a warmer welcome next time.  The food is what matters here - and it is exceptional.  The ambience/decor also very tastefully done.  You can hear the roar of the gas stoves which reminded me so much of my experiences in China.  They have some fish dishes as well.  Lamb is the real star of the show here.  Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was not anything spectacular, but it was satisfactory and \"enough\".  We only ordered a few things including a peanuty noodle (dan dan mein I believe) as well as dumplings in vinegar soup (so now you wouldn't need to dip the dumplings in the vinegar again).   They were both good but again, I was not blown away by it.   Also the service was a little weird; we walked in and the entire staff was having lunch and when we told them how many people we had, they just continued to eat.  The interior was a little dingy....it was poorly lit but did not have a \"fancy restaurant\" vibe...it just felt...uncomfortable to be eating Chinese food.   I don't think I'll be coming back to this restaurant because it is extremely average and nothing sticks out."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE hot pot.  Quality of meat was pretty low, and the price was fairly high around 20 dollars."}
{"text":"Shaanxi Restaurant took over the space of Ting's Shabu Shabu (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/tings-shabu-shabu-restaurant-thornhill#hrid:60i-RFLCmvrOreVkK18rbg) which was a hot pot restaurant.   Shaanxi Restaurant is really a Northwestern Chinese Cuisine Restaurant with influence of Sichuan. Though the menu only has 50% of the selection being spicy, so it is really safe to take your non spicy eating friends to dine here.   Special Hand Made Noodle ($4.99)  - The waitress asked if I want it non spicy?? why.. if there is a chili next to it on the menu and I ordering that... puzzle....  - Really simple thick, wide and chewy noodle with great texture.. though the portion looked small but was quite filling  - The spiciness is more of a sour and spicy... which is the characteristic of Shaanxi cuisine..instead of Sichuan peppercorn style   The waitresses here were both really really friendly! Big smile, talk to all patrons in Mandarin with their sweet voices... I got a chance to practice mine too, trying to explain why someone like me from Southern China can eat spicy food...   Shaanxi Restaurant still serves Hot Pot. For Lunch Specials (11:30 to 3)is AYCE for $8.99.. they have the veggie and some of the items in the fridge in self served style. Or you can order their hot pot set (11:30 - 5) for $6.99. For AYCE dinner the price will be for $14.99.   I guess I need to come back and try their hot pot soon...."}
{"text":"The Liang Pi was made traditionally. Shao zi noodle was okay  but not that impressive"}
{"text":"Very traditional Chinese Shanxi restaurant. Also have some Sichuan food. Good flavor and quality. Worthy to drop by with friends if you love traditional Chinese noodle foods."}
