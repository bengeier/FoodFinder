{"text":"I came here after reading a BlogTO article about the city's best huevos rancheros. The diner decor is really nicely done - the folks on Restaurant Takeover did a good job.  I settled on the huevos rancheros and a cup of bottomless drip coffee. Not the best coffee I've ever had, but what you'd expect at a diner.   Overall, the entree was okay. Sunny side up eggs, refried black beans, grated cheddar and pico de gallo on top of fried corn tortillas with home fries. The corn tortillas that ruined it for me. They were stale. Only the edges had a crunch. They were hard to chew and cut into. What redeemed the dish were the fresh ingredients.  The service was friendly and good, nothing to complain about. I'll have to return to try other things on the rest of the menu. The pricing was reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Nice... That was the best burger I've had in a long time... See you guys soon! The decor was nice... But my girlfriend was not to happy about the washroom , I didn't see it..."}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips which were overdone. Maybe my own mistake by choosing something that I thought would be fairly easy to make. The service is slow and the place isn't very clean. Servers are generally friendly but forgetful."}
{"text":"This place is a 3 minute walk from my house, has a classic diner feel, has cozy booths, is small, is decently priced, and I so wanted it to be five stars but nope.   Here's why:  Coffee is bad. If you took coffee, filled a quarter of a cup with it then filled the rest with hot water, you'd have the recipe for this coffee. Also, even though it was bad, refills were hard to come by. Only got one refill and I had to keep my eye out for the server to ask.   Service. My friend doesn't drink coffee. So she ordered a chocolate milk. Server didn't know if they had chocolate milk. Then after 10 minutes we figured she forgot to tell us if she had it. We waved her over and she said they didn't have it. Then we asked instead if they could make a chocolate milkshake. She said she had to check if they had chocolate ice cream. At the end of the meal the chocolate milkshake ($5) came...(side note: i saw one of the kitchen people come out holding a bag of milk and chocolate sauce after the milkshake came out...are those not the ingredients for chocolate milk?)  Breakfast was classic and good ($9) Ordered eggs over medium, they came runny. Potatoes were meh. I could get same quality breakfast at Sunset Grill for $1 less and wouldn't be in at the edge of my seat in suspense the whole time about chocolate milk/milkshake."}
{"text":"Good food, good decor and nice staff. The only thing a little off-putting is that often whenever I go in there, there's absolutely no staff around and I have to pop my head into the kitchen window to get someone. But this is understandable because the back is connected to their pub next door. But maybe they should put a \"seat yourself\" sign up or something to make it less awkward until a server can check in?   I recommend this place though, I've had nothing but good food and good service. Prices for things can be a little much, like their poutine; which is awesome, but $10 is pretty steep."}
{"text":"Bland. Everything was so bland. I had the burger with a side of poutine. Poutine didn't have cheese curds (was some type of white cheddar). Gravy tasted like bland nothingness. Burger was again bland and wayyyy too oily. I tried some of the home fries from my table mate's plate and it tasted like potatoes with oil. Coffee had this weird metal aftertaste. I'm not a brunch snob, I'd happily go to sunrise grill or chow down on a Tim Horton's breakfast sandwich. But seriously, the food is gross here."}
{"text":"A smaller diner, wentfor brunch. Service a little slower, so if in a rush, might want to head elsewhere. Ordered their breakfast special, was a sizeable portion.  Home fries are home made and are a homerun."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Came here for breakfast at noon and I got wonderful portions with great presentation for a good price. Vibe and atmosphere was authentic and cozy. Will come here again when I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious food, decent price, good portion, typical diner food and atmosphere.  Waitress was friendly, but the wait for service and food could take some time.  I've had the breakfast, chicken club sandwich, pulled pork poutine, and The Carnivore omelette so far.  They are all quite yummy.  I'll definitely come back to try out other items on their menu."}
{"text":"i ate here once and literally threw up the food was so bad. instead of GOOD FOOD, the sign should read \"ABERRANT BREAKFASTS\" or \"NIGHTMARE SUPPERS.\""}
