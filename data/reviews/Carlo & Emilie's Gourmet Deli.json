{"text":"The food, service, and staff at the Gourmet Deli are all authentic and excellent.  On the wall they have written their full menu on the black board; it is a mix of New York Deli, Southern European cuisine and Italian restaurant.  All of the specialties are created by Carlo, or Emilie and reveal their Italian & French heritage.   I have been for lunch many times and have enjoyed ordering my favorites that remind me of the New York Deli's I grew up on.  Most recently I have been just ordering the special of the day; today was a French lentil soup created by Emilie and it was wonderful. The service is very fast, especially considering every dish is created to order.  Over time they have been busier and they seem to have increased their staff to keep up their service level."}
{"text":"Walked in at 6:53 and they shooed me right away saying they're taking no more orders and that they're out of bread. They're supposed to close at 7. Drove a ways to try this place out. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Serious deliciousness!  I went there twice this week and ordered a pastrami sandwich and tried my friend's Chicken parmesan sandwich.   Total and utter deliciousness.  Had the meatball sandwich the second time I went, but wasn't too excited about it.  That's probably just because I am not a big fan of meatballs, but I just wanted to try it anyway.  My husband took the kids while I was working on Saturday, and my 8 year old ate my husband's steak sandwich and his spaghetti.  He had it all over his face!  Needless to say, this place will be a regular for me and my family.  I've been bringing different friends as well and converted them as well!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are always excellent and the service is stellar. I got cheese and fancy salami to go and the owner made suggestions and cut everything based on my preference. Definitely swing by if you're in Chandler!"}
{"text":"good food and huge portions...I ordered their full sandwich thinking a half may not fill me up, I was wrong, their full sandwich was huge and I couldn't finish it all...the sandwich was really tasty though."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches! I recently traveled to Chandler on a business trip, and found my new favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the best sandwiches and they have the best gluten free bread! Great service and great atmosphere! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner after work. Everyone working was friendly and told me all about the menu and their favorite options. I decided to go with the butternut squash ravioli with brown butter sage sauce, a meatball and a house salad. The house salad is just spring mix lettuce and balsamic dressing, which was good, but expected a little more Than just lettuce for $3. Now even though I didn't notice they forgot my meatball until home, The ravioli made up for it!(And they give you a big serving!) Absolutely delicious, you can tell everything is homemade, including the pasta. And the butter sauce was a perfect addition. it was all services with fresh garlic bread, and hit the spot perfectly! I will definitely be coming back! Hoping to try that meatball next time!! if you are thinking about it, GO! You won't be disappointed. UPDATE- i went back for more deliciousness and that elusive meatball. I met Emilie while there, she apologized for the forgotten meatball and gave me a half meatball sandwich on the house, and it was incredible. One of the best meatball sandwiches I've had! Made on homemade baguette, it didn't get soggy, the sauce was wonderful and meatballs delicious. Now that's how you get return customers! Like I said before, you need to go!"}
{"text":"If you can teach me how to say \"holy cannoli\" in Italian you need to know about this entirely fantastic deli! It was recommended to me and I made excuses to get over there i just wish I'd done it sooner! Great big salads and sandwiches hot or cold! Fresh deli chef made pastas and desserts. I'm super excited we work nearby to eat here often. I'll be back soon!  KDS"}
{"text":"The dessert is amazing. On top of that the sandwiches are great. Chicken parm is my favorite. This place is getting more busy everytime I come and I can see why."}
{"text":"What I miss about NYC, a Gourmet Deli in walking distance from my home.  Italian and French inspired/owned deli is exactly what Chandler needs!  What it lacks to complete this perfect European experience is gourmet coffee and wine!  (Carlo is currently waiting for the liquor licence...can't wait!) Definitely my new favorite place! #KeepitLocal"}
{"text":"Great service and Great food. I had the chicken Piccata special and it was amazing. Great atmosphere with the owner singing and coming over to make sure everything was great. Loved that my salad had big chunks of Artichoke. Left full and happy. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Classic fair done consistently well! Have tried most of the menu, yet to be disappointed. The owners are kind and dedicated to their craft. The employees act more like family, always a sign of a good establishment."}
{"text":"Solid! I was in the mood for a sandwich.  Not an ordinary sandwich but rather a really good sandwich.  Seems as though unless you spend $15-$20 in a high end Deli you just can't get it.  YELPERS had this one right.  I even asked for a combination that was not on the menu.  No problem, well just figure a price.   Cleanliness 4 Stars Friendliness 5 Stars Atmosphere 4 Stars (realize it is not a full service restaurant.) Value 4 Stars  Food 4.5 Stars  This is the real deal.  Not the absolute best I've had, but best for the price,value, quality perspective.  I'll be back but next time to try the hot sandwiches.  I overheard many saying how good the meatballs were."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place!  I have been here multiple times and it just keeps getting better! Carlo and Emilie are so friendly and take the time to talk to you, make suggestions, and make sure you are happy with your meal. It is always packed, but the service is always fast and friendly. The butternut squash ravioli is delicious and Carlo's scratch made sausage is the best I've had in Arizona. The patio is beautiful and it is dog friendly which is great. The desserts, freshly baked bread, and selection of meats and cheeses are the best in the area!"}
{"text":"Awesome Italian deli! Carlo recommended the prosciutio, salame, and Asiago. AMAZING! will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times for lunch. Sandwiches are great. Prepared fresh. Well baked baguettes make the hogies (subs) special when combined with their meats. Several unusual combinations are available. Have yet to try their hot sandwiches or pasta dishes which look very appealing. Small indoor eating area but there is a patio.  Check their hours. They close early."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed after the other reviews.  I will agree wholeheartedly that the restaurant is cute and staff friendly - they definitely care.  We sampled a Stromboli of some kind that was delicious so I was getting pretty excited at that point. I ordered the advertised special Eiffel Tower sandwich but they didn't have all the ingredients when we got there around 2pm.  The owner sent an employee out to get what was missing while I was in the bathroom.  Given that it was a fairly late lunch I just didn't want to wait so I switched my order to a meatball and my wife had a chicken parmesan.  However the sandwiches that we had were decidedly average.  The red sauce is very plain for my taste and really too thin for that type of hot sandwich.  It was also a pretty messy affair since the bread was fully sliced in half.    My daughter said the pasta with meatball was very good.  I thought the prices were fair and service good - I'll definitely give them another try and hopefully be able to give a higher rating next time."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this deli since we're from Jersey, and Phoenix Magazine recommended it.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed.  Not nearly as good as DeFalcos or Andreoli's.  The house salad greens were really fresh, and the dressing amazing.  But the sausage, peppers, & onion hot sandwich & the chicken parm were just \"ok\".  Nothing great...the sauce on both needs to be kicked up and brought to life.  Wish we could still go to Bruno's in Manahawkin, NJ!!"}
{"text":"Great place!  I had the Italian wedding soup. It was so good and all ingredients were fresh.  I tried a piece of my babe's pastrami. It was also fresh, freshly cut with delicious grilled onions."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Super friendly staff. They have many great sandwiches to choose from. Chicken parmigiana is my favorite. They also have some great desserts!"}
{"text":"This such a wonderful spot to eat at. Carlo is do accommodating and gracious and his food is delicious"}
{"text":"Decent food but never order a sandwich for takeout unless u wanna construct ur own messy sandwich. Homestyle bread is waaay to thick as well maybe cut out inside. Basically gave up on making my sandwhich as I got sauce everywhere trying to pick up pieces of chicken parm onto heavy thick bread."}
{"text":"wasn't impressed. got the grilled chicken walnut salad! was surprised to find a whole grilled (but not seasoned in any way I could taste) chicken breast. not enough walnuts or goat cheese, and the dressing was an odd pairing. my hubby's Italian sandwich was tasty! though!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a sandwich this good since I was back in NYC - That's me SAYING something. Everything about the Gourmet Deli is what I've been looking for ever since experiencing real deli quality back east. From the fresh ingredients, to the owners (who are very friendly and warm) to the overall atmosphere. This place is the real deal. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Tried the meatball sandwich...WOW...if I had an Italian mother, this is how she would cook!  Try the fresh baked loaves of bread to go. Impressive."}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome owners!  We have eaten here several times and tried something new each time.  Haven't found anything we wouldn't order again!  The meatball sandwich, lasagna, roasted butternut ravioli and penne with pesto are some of our favorites. The carrot cake is the best we have ever had!"}
{"text":"I started going to this deli shortly after it opened.   Loved the friendly staff and the food I tried, including many of the delicious desserts.   It's with regret that I write this review, as I love \"mom and pop\" restaurants and we have so few in Chandler.   I think this restaurant has grown faster than it can manage as the quality of the food has greatly deteriorated.    Much of the food is not \"home made\"as many of these comments suggest.  The pasta/gnocci is not.  Many of the desserts are not.  The bread is made in house. And the sauces for pasta are thrown in a pan to be heated while you wait.  A good tomato based sauce is not made in five minutes.   You should ask what is home made and what is not when you order.  Many of the meats and cheeses are imported from Italy and I think that is what people who love the sandwiches are raving about.  That's not \"homemade\".  No home made mozzarella!    The past half dozen visits where I have ordered the  putenesco (sp?) sauce had a quarter inch of olive oil laying on top of the sauce.  Yuck.  There was so much oil it couldn't be stirred in and I had to throw it away.  This is suppose to be a spicier sauce with  crushed red pepper thrown in.  It's been missing in 4/6 orders.  I stopped ordering it.   Since this is such a tiny deli, not designed for sit down lunch unless you want to eat outside, many of my orders are \"to go\".  The past dozen visits have resulted in missing food from my order 6 times (which I did'n't know until I left the deli).  That's %50 of the time!  It's certainly not intentional---these are wonderful people that own this deli---but there is not a lot of oversight of the new employees.  And while I love Carlos, one of the owners, he just doesn't pay attention and is easily distracted from what he is doing.  I also think because they have such a small work space and employees are on top of each other trying to fill orders that mistakes are made.   They also don't answer the phone.  Don't bother leaving a  message.  I was informed by the cashier that they don't check messages.   The deli case is so inconsistent from visit to visit, I've stopped even looking.  Half the time it's totally empty, so you can't buy deli meats or cheeses.  Then they tried offering various side dishes.  But unless you looked down into the deli case, you didn't know they were making/buying from other vendors many new dishes.  There was nothing on the order board to indicate these were available and I suspect many people didn't even notice as that case is often blocked by the line to order food.    I hope that the owners can get things straightened out. I wish them the best.  I will check back in few months.  But for now, I will not be visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the chicken parm sandwich,  it was the best.  Fresh prepared on homemade roll with a very tasty marinara sauce.  I will  be back and bring friends to enjoy.  A week later I went back with family members and everyone was very pleased at the service and the tasty food.  If you haven't tried this place YOU MUST, and then come to your own conclusion.  I believe you will agree with me."}
{"text":"Love everything about it. I've been waiting for an authentic Italian sandwich shop in Chandler for a long time and this place is exactly what I wanted. The owner is from Italy and his standards are very high. Amazing place."}
{"text":"Carlo is an amazing man who makes amazing food! You walk in to this cute little deli and treated like family. I love the pasta specially the tortellini with the Alfredo sauce.. Sounds pretty basic but that's beauty of it. The garlic bread served with it is freshly made everyday and is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wow!  Outstanding atmosphere for a good ole fashion Italian deli.  Not only were we greeted at the door by Carlo, the extremely friendly owner, but had two of the best sandwiches in Chandler.  Meatball sandwich and the special of the day, which was a Porchetta on homemade bread with Asiago.  Great flavoring without too much extra seasoning to mask the true taste of Italian meat.  Perfect amount of sauce and condiment, and the bread was melt in your mouth delicious.  We couldn't have been happier and will make this a regular spot.  Thanks to Carlo for catering to our every need!"}
{"text":"The owners Carlo and Emile are so delightful and want to make sure you really enjoy your meal and their restaurant. You order with the cashier off of a chalkboard menu. Many of their items are handmade like the bread. I ordered the 4 cheese tortellini and it was delicious! Midway through our meal, Carlo came through the restaurant and passed around pieces of stromboli that just came out of the oven- so good and fresh tasting!"}
{"text":"Great food and great hospitality.  I ordered the house salad and chicken pesto. My coworkers had the chicken Parmesan and eggplant parmesan.  Delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a must try! They have great meats and know flavor! You walk in and order at the counter you can see them make your food they bake there own bread make there own cheese and do it right! The employees were really nice and helpful this place will go far!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible and the staff really cares about the customers. When I eat here I feel like I'm transported to a little deli in Italy where I'm eating with friends and family."}
{"text":"A hidden gem if ever there was one!  Doesn't look like much but don't let that fool you, it's a fantastic little find in a Fry's center at Alma School & Germann.  We ate there when they first opened a few years ago but not since...our mistake.  Went back last night and were thrilled with our choices of sandwich and desserts.  My wife had the chicken burger and I had the turkey sandwich with asiago cheese...both were amazing.  For dessert we had the crumb cake, which was New York- wonderful, and the triple chocolate cake, equally fantastic.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Fun new Italian deli in Chandler. Trying out the gnocchi and meatballs with some limoncello cake and carrot cake! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the location I loved it from the start. It is a typical deli you would find right in Italy having similar qualities such as a glass case with cheese and homemade desserts, ingredients all around, and even one of the owners ringing up customers!  This authentic fusion of Italian and French cuisine left me longing to go back to visit Europe! We tried this place for the first time because of the reviews but this is going to become a regular date night spot for sure.  We ordered the meat tortellini with the Bolognese sauce, the ravioli in the sage and burned butter, and finished up with an Italian cheesecake (which was made that morning). If you have never had hand made pasta or homemade Italian sweets this place will destroy your taste buds for sure and the garbage found in \"authentic\" Italian restaurants will leaving you annoyed you thought it was the real deal. I can only compare it to what my Nana makes back home in NY! The service and level of care that goes into the food really shows. The best part is you can get this meal for less than $40!!"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices!  I had the penne with puttanesca sauce.  It was a huge bowl of pasta, enough for two servings.  They also have a deli case with imported meats and cheeses.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Muah! Authentic. This food brings back so many memories of all the meals and parties I've had with loved ones."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom to eat tonight. Ordered meatball and parm. I'm getting my drink and noticed the lady behind the counter making my sandwich is also eating at the same time walking to and from the fridge. That turned me off I asked for a refund and the female owner was so RUDE to me I was as polite as I could be. It was really weird. She actually went off on me and how dare I insult her and her employee. Her employee is pregnant and gets hungry. Then I try to tell her that I've been pregnant before and when you work in the food industry and you probably shouldn't be eating while you're making other peoples's food."}
{"text":"Great customer service, as soon as I walked in I was greeted and felt welcomed. I had the meatball sandwich with the house bread and it was very good. It definitely satisfied my craving for Italian."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday because we wanted good Italian food. It's a deli type place which offers a variety of food. They have pizza, and a variety of fresh deli meat sandwiches. They also have pasta as well. I had a chicken parmigiana sandwich on \"real\" bread. It was tasty. They also sell good pastries, too. The owner brought us complementary pastry to try which was really nice. We enjoyed our food on a small outdoor patio."}
{"text":"My husband brought home a couple of sandwiches for lunch today. Our first time at Carlo and Emilie's. Both of the sandwiches were phenomenal. The #2 and the #8. So yummy. I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The service and food were outstanding. The gnocchi with vodka sauce hit the spot. The garlic bread was perfect for dipping in the sauce. My other half had a cold sandwich, the asiago cheese was divine and went well with the meat and amazing bread. This place should be packed! It's truly a little gem!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I am so glad we have found a family owned Italian restaurant so close to home. We were greeted by friendly staff as soon as we arrived and they were more than happy to offer suggestions as to what is good off of the menu (answer: everything! But they told us what is most popular). My daughter loved the spaghetti, husband enjoyed his butternut squash ravioli and I liked my meat lasagna. The best part of the meal was the antipasto salad we shared. So fresh and delicious! Although the food was exceptional, I would come back just for the salad! We had a cannoli for dessert.... Yum! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love a good Italian deli. The quality of the meats, the flavorful cheeses... oh man. Carlo and Emilie's was perfect. House made bread was a perfect edition. Great sandwich, incredibly friendly service and a great atmosphere. The house made potato chips were THE BOMB. I loved it. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed my deli sandwich. Definitely a welcome treat as we explore the food in our new neighborhood. I doubt I'll ever walk into a different sandwich shop in the future and I can't wait to try some of their other food items!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Owned and ran by a father and his daughter. They really want you to get the taste of real Italian flavor with un compromised ingredients. The pastrami sandwich will literally change your day. You'll find yourself telling your family, friends and coworkers about it the rest of the day."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had been really wanting to try this place. Well, today was the day we finally did and it was amazing. When ordering get the half size even if you've got a big appetite. I ordered a full and it's basically two sandwiches. I tried the capocollo, salami, and asiago cheese on their homemade Italian herb bread with all of the toppings. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Also, order the lemoncocco for a drink! It comes in a can and it's superb! It's not too sweet and it's refreshing. I'll definitely be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, no better place in town to get an authentic Italian sandwich.  Portions are enormous and fairly priced.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  Will go back time and again when I'm looking for a great lunch out!"}
{"text":"Finally got here after wanting to try for quite some time....glad we did!  The food is fantastic.  Mascarpone and butternut squash ravioli with sage and butter sauce was great..add a fresh homemade Italian sausage to make it even better.  Hands down best antipasto salad I have ever had.  Wife had lasagna...very good.  Daughter loved spaghetti ...not the easiest 4yo to please.  Good selection of desert.  We shared the chocolate cannoli...WOW!  Even my daughter loved it!  The restaurant is small and the dining area is nothing to brag about but the food and service are exceptional."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!? This place is amazingly so good. We took the whole family for lunch last week, from the pasta to the entrees to the sandwiches & soups, you can't go wrong. Carlos is a sweetheart and will accommodate your request. Clean and yummy!"}
{"text":"Never judge a book by it's cover - yet, another example! Delicious food, absolutely delicious. We ordered 4 dishes, and all of them were great, so it's a safe assumption  that the rest is too. The patio could use some work, as could the inside. But, I'm a believer in good food over ambiance. Very good prices too!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Best meatballs ever!  Owners are very nice and helpful as it was my first time there. I've had a chance to go back a few times and the subs are delicious as well. Great place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Outstanding food, friendly people and great service. They really deserve all 5 stars. If you are in the south-east valley, you really must try it. I will definitely be back to this place again & again.While in line waiting to order, there were some nice fellows at a table closest to the register. I told my wife what looked good to me, and they overheard. One of them spoke up and said \"I've had both this week, and they are both good\". Then he offered me some bread & cheese and said \"you gotta try this\". It was amazing! I thanked him and ordered the Chicken Parm on crusty bread. It was fantastic, and HUGE! Their bread is delicious, and you can tell that they put a lot of love and pride in their dishes. The wife had butternut squash ravioli with butter sauce. I never really loved that dish until i tried hers. It was unbelievable!!"}
{"text":"We've ordered a variety of sandwiches and pastas, all have been good. A little on the pricy side for the portions of pasta served, but it's justified by the quality. So far the marscapone filled butternut squash ravioli is my favorite!"}
{"text":"A buddy of mine took me here for lunch a couple of weeks ago and I am really glad he did. It is  a fantastic little spot for lunch/dinner/desserts. You order at the counter and they'll bring your food out to you. I tried the chicken parm (italian deli/restaurant litmus test) and it passed. Definitely a strong showing. A half a sandwich is enough for most folks and a whole one is good if you are trying to take a nap afterwards. It is a bit more expensive than other places around it, but you are paying for quality, this isn't a chain. In fact, it is family owned and you may want to call ahead if you are traveling more than 20 minutes to get here...the first time we went they were closed for a week while they were on vacation."}
{"text":"This is absolutely stellar authentic old school Italian American food. You cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent customer service. We have been twice now. Everything we've eaten has been great. Beef braciole was awesome."}
{"text":"I'm going to leave this at 3.5 stars until i get a third visit in. I think the pluses: staff is nice and attentive, dishes are hearty and filling, family run business so they are attentive to you and your order, also dish and food presentation was nice.  Things I think could use some work: 1) meatball was so mushy and so soft, it felt undercooked, though it didn't look it. It was enough of a softness to make me sort of not want to eat anymore. So i practically left the whole thing there on my plate. 2) looked for fresh Parmesan to top of my dish which was very low on the salt and all i found were prepackaged Parmesan with all sorts of additives listed on the paper container. Disappointed that they put that much attention to making home style food but then only offer prepackaged parm and salt. 3) pricing was a lot for the level of enjoyment. It was a big serving of food but i didn't find the enjoyment factor high for the mount paid.  Considering my dish was 14$ and change without any drinks or appetizers, I expected to have a better culinary experience. Maybe third time's the charm?  It looked very nice when it came out and maybe I'll enjoy another dish next time. Not sure how soon it'll be till i go back though."}
{"text":"Okay I've been reading about his place for some time now and finally decided to give it a try yesterday, I called my order in for pick up since I was in a hurry and it was ready upon my arrival, when I finally got home and open up the container for my #13 sandwich (Large) I was blown away by the size, the thing was huge and tasted wonderful, I also ordered the lasagna to take to work the next day for lunch and it too was wonderful, so in a nutshell I Love This Place and can't wait to go back again.....JC"}
{"text":"Sadness fills me knowing that I used to work only a few miles away from where this is restaurant is located and that I no longer work there so I can't enjoy the Mascarpone Cheese & Butternut Squash filled Ravioli with Sage Butter Sauce on a regular basis.  With that said, my experience was as follows. When I first walked in, I could tell that I was going to enjoy my food. It's a pretty small place but still, they have a good size menu and it appeared they were making everything by hand. After glancing over the items offered, I asked for recommendations (even though I kind of knew what I was going to get) and settled on the Mascarpone Cheese & Butternut Squash filled Ravioli. I had ordered it to go and it came out fairly quickly; the wait was not much later than expected. I did have to have a quick bite before leaving the parking lot ... BIG mistake, because after that I was hooked! The ravioli is so tasty there really is no perfect way to describe it. It's soft and creamy from the Mascarpone Cheese and has a hint of sweetness from the Butternut Squash, and the Sage Butter just makes it so well balanced. There's not much more to say except that it left me wanting more!  My only comments about why the minus one star are: for the price, I thought the portion was a little bit small. The garlic bread it came with was fairly tasteless & really underwhelming. I think it would've made for a better plate if the garlic bread was left off & a few more pieces of ravioli were there."}
{"text":"The steak sandwich was awesome.   They cooked it exactly how I liked it.  The bread was crusty and I asked that they make it into garlic bread.   They said no problem.   They couldn't be more accommodating with changing up their menu to adjust to different tastes.  Very nice staff."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday. The door was not half-way shut before I was given a friendly welcome by Carlo. I was shown the special and soup of the day, but I came in with my mind set on a chicken parm sandwich. I ordered it with Carlo's bread. The size and quality were both well worth the $9 for the sandwich. Everything about it was super-yummy: great breading, chicken was good texture, sauce was flavorful but not so thick as to mask the flavor of the chicken. It was also obvious that the Carlo's bread had been made fresh that morning. LOL the only downside is the sandwich was so good, it may discourage me from trying the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!  I've been here 5 times and try something new every time. Today I had the Gnocchi in their new Quattro Formaggi (four cheese) sauce. So rich, creamy, and satisfying. Carlo has been here for each of my visits. He has a passion about how he makes his food.  Most importantly, Carlo knows how to treat a customer. If you haven't been here, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best deli/sandwich restaurant in the area.  From homemade rolls to mouth watering Lasagna.  You will be the next on Yelp to Rave at how amazing the food is.  Carlo you have done this part of the valley a favor, and this is by far my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly,  clean and amazingly delicious food. Love the tuna melt and the eggplant parmesiano"}
{"text":"Fry's Shopping Center, Alma and Germann. Discovered it from talking to fellow employee who came to the IRC with sandwich. Finally had one. Homemade sandwiches, pasta, salad's and very tasty. Six inch sub is perfect for one person. Desserts are all homemade as well. Local and great, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Very friendly, very good and sometimes really great food reasonably priced. Watch for daily specials. Give Carlo a few days notice and he will make Delicious Oysters  Rockefeller for you. The Vietnamese Pho soup was outstanding.  Lots of pasta dishes and very generous portioned sandwiches. Carlo makes the breads daily. Best deli in the valley."}
{"text":"My wife raved about the lemoncello cake, the pecan pie was good and the chocolate cannoli was very good."}
{"text":"Holy cow was this place good! Got the meat ball sub and a cold sub that was to die for! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Really high quality deli meat and their portions are very very generous. Got the salami and prosciutto last time and it had a mountain of expensive Italian meats! Sitting here waiting to try the meatball marinara!"}
{"text":"Moved to AZ.  Needed a sandwich shop worthy of my hard earned dollar.   This place is it."}
{"text":"It's a small place but has indoor & outdoor seating. Fairly friendly staff. I ordered the smoked turkey sandwhich w/asiago cheese on a baguette & my fiancé has a hot sandwhich which was roast beef. We got 2 full size sandwiches because we share with our 6 & 3 year old daughters. They also have a kids menu but as most parents know, all kids want your food! So we did it this way. We asked for pop n chips on the side. The chips are clearly homemade and very good. My only issues with this place is the following: 1.) our food did not all come out at the same time. I got mine 1st & my fiancé got his 5mins later. 2.) they got the bread wrong for my fiancé & forgot his chips. 3.) I know baguette are suppose to be tougher bread BUT this bread has been sitting out a little too. I've had this kind of bread several times other places & this was a little to hard to chew. HOWEVER, they quickly fixed things by sincerely apologizing, got us more chips, and 2 free deserts! We will be back again to try the pasta!!!! It smells and looks so good. Flavor is there and it's a cute & quite spot."}
{"text":"Got off of Ocotillo golf course and wanted to eat somewhere that was very Chandler-like. We chose to eat at this little sub shop in a strip mall. Boy, did we choose correctly. Lee's Sandwich size was enormous. We had a 6-inch authentic Italian sub w homemade chips. We had sourdough and baguette breads. Everything was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and wonderfully friendly owner/staff. My wife and I love eating here since they have great baguettes and a gourmet menu for a very competitive price. If you get a large sandwich, it's enough for 2 people easily!"}
{"text":"Nice little place, excellent italian deli sandwiches, I love the baguettes.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful local restaurant. My family and I are struggling right now and emili took it upon herself to invite m over for lunch. When I got there she provided an entire meal for my whole family! With some cookies and cake.. Yummy. Wonderful people!!! Will go back !!! The food is AMAZING! Never have I had something this good! Mouth watering sausages!! And the pecan bread !!! OMG to die for! PLEASE PLEASE GO VISIT THEM!! Great people, great food!"}
{"text":"My husband and two teen boys ate their tonight.  I ordered cheese tortellini with a red sauce with olives and capers. It was delicious!  My husband had a pastrami on rye and one son had a chicken parm sandwich and the other had an Italian sandwich.  They all enjoyed their meals.  We finished with dessert. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is very much like a Italian Cafe... They serve food which is made fresh daily in the mornings , I have tried their Ravioli and also the famous checking burger... They were really good.. Comparable to the very best I had. I would highly recommend this place.  They also sell fresh made bread and desserts."}
{"text":"The meatball sandwhich and italian sausage sandwhich were outstanding!! The portions are spot on."}
{"text":"Two words... NEVER AGAIN. Subway is better... The employees were clearly pissed off that people were coming in still ten minutes before close. Had no issue making it obvious... Big no-no. That kind of attitude is what I expect at Burger King. Not a gourmet Deli. Our meatballs were clearly microwaved, and they ran out of their number one house bread. Which screams \"we are cheap\" in my opinion, another big red flag for me. Might be easy to fool an Arizonian, but this is NOT a gourmet Deli. Save your money. Go to subway"}
{"text":"The meatballs and sausage were wonderful.  Butternut squash ravioli was also very good and one person order a gluten free pasta with a requested homemade sauce and they accommodated her.   The tiramasu is homemade and wonderful. We live West Valley but will go back when in  the area. Fast service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We've had the sausage and pepper sub and the chicken parm sub. Both were delicious and pretty authentic italian considering we are out in AZ. The wait can be a little bit but it is worth it. Also got tiramisu which was very good (and has a high alcohol content)."}
{"text":"Ok... this review comes with some regret!  If i rate this place like i want to even more people are going to go! This used to be my little secret get away for lunch.  However, each time I go there are more and more people there.    Carlo and Emily are wonderful.  Always quick with a hello and checking up on you.  I've had so many things that I can't choose a favorite.  From their fresh baked breads to their home made pastas to their amazing soups and to-die-for desserts.  You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Was in the area looking for a quick sandwich on my way to a meeting and popped in this place.  Fantastic service.  The owner walks around singing quietly (which adds to the ambiance) checking on everyone and making sure their food is up to par.  He greets you as you enter and his staff is just as friendly.  I had a salami, capocollo, and asiago sub on a baguette and it was pretty tasty.  The presentation for just a sandwich is awesome, with fresh meats and cheeses and fresh baked breads and rolls.  I ordered a large sandwich which is essentially two 8\" subs, which I ended up taking half home as I didn't know it would be that big.  They have fresh baked potato chips, pickles and peppers they include as well.  Fantastic lunch, all for around $12.  It would be under $10 for a regular sandwich meal and drink, and it's plenty of food.  I would definitely recommend this place.  The restaurant is clean with outside, shaded seating.  The staff is great and the food is spectacular.  I've been back multiple times when in the area.  I would highly recommend this place as they have pastas, salads, cold and hot subs, full Italian plates, etc.  Fantastic food."}
{"text":"Greatest little Italian Deli! Gotta try the hot pastrami and the homemade sausage, all on their own homemade bread, spectacular!"}
{"text":"It was a few minutes after 3pm on a Tuesday.  They should have been closed,  but a man, I assume was the owner, let us in anyway!  And after browsing the to go menu,   I realize I'm right because his picture is on it. Lol. This place is tiny, but they have a huge menu to choose from.  It was a hard,  but I chose the gnocchi and meat sauce.  Did not disappoint!  The gnocchi was cooked perfectly and I'm sure the meat sauce was made from scratch! My husband got the meatball sub on homemade bread. He also enjoyed his meal. I tried the meatball and it was really tasty! Carlo (the owner), also added to the ambience, by singing something Italian, while cooking. We'll definitely be back!  Just had it yesterday for lunch,  and I'm already craving it for dinner today!"}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace to try with my husbands grandparents and this gem popped up on the radar! Everyone cleared their plates. We had chicken park, eggplant parm, lasagna and spaghetti. Excellent and fresh. Took two cannolis home for desert. We can't wait to come back to this lovely little restaurant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  A taste of Italy.  Pasta, sandwiches, homemade soups and deserts are all great.  Carlo brings samples of his creations to the customers to try and he's always fun to talk to.  Would highly recommend this deli."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out for a late lunch Sunday. I was worried it might be crowded for Father's Day but I think it was late enough to miss crowd. We split an Antipasto salad and bowl of pasta Bolognese. The salad had big pieces of artichokes, shaved parmesan, 2 or 3 different types of deli meat. It was delicious. The person next to us was eating a slice of white pizza. I was talking with him and didn't see it on the menu. Next thing you know Carlo brought over a slice for us to try. Super nice guy and the pizza was good. He loves to interact with his customers. The pasta bolognese was also very very good! We will difinitely be back to try more of their menu. PS they also have delicious homemade desserts. Cannolis we're Awesome"}
{"text":"Last March I moved out of Old Town Scottsdale after 15 years. I was not happy about leaving DeFalco's...until I found this place. It's just as good as DeFalco's, SERIOUSLY. That's really saying something. The food is outstanding, absolutely authentic and incredibly delicious. The tiramisu is INCREDIBLE.   I am over the moon to have found this place! Absolutely the DeFalco's of the south side of the Valley."}
{"text":"My wife LOVES this Deli, especially the Italian subs (I think it is the prosciutto, salami and Asiago that is her favorite).  Whether she is having a bad day or wants to celebrate - this Deli is good for both.  The price and the service are both great and will keep you coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a yummy lunch, saw the stellar reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.   When I got to the parking lot, I remembered seeing the sign before, but nothing about the sign or curbside appearance made me go inside back then. (Thank goodness for Yelp!)  Was immediately impressed by the welcoming staff, the giant list of menu items (for a small-ish deli) and the beautiful array of meats, cheeses and other delectables in the cooler-display!  The fantastic reviews -- TRUE!!   Hubby had the special... a nice big sandwich with fresh-shaved pork and all the fixings and I enjoyed the smoked turkey & Asiago cheese sandwich.   I know it's a good deli when I even enjoyed the pickle that came with my sandwich! (NOT a pickle lover, but at a true deli like this, they taste fresh and delicious!   Had to share a tiramissu to give Carlo & Emilie's the final test, and even THAT tasted like someone's Grandmother made it!   This is our new stop for a delicious sandwich and delightful owners that sincerely wish for you to enjoy your meal!   We've already picked our next menu items to try - hubby's got his eye on the meatball sandwich and I'm thinking that the marinated shrimp salad will be delish on an upcoming warm day!   Carlo mentioned tomorrow's special... short ribs!! Is it too soon to go back?"}
{"text":"Update: been coming here 3 years now, Carlo is an artiste! The best way to have lunch is to say hello to Carlo and ask him what you should have for lunch and immediately order whatever he suggests. No discussion needed, hes never made a bad dish!  Friendly, intimate and delicious. We were greeted at the counter by the owner. The butternut squash ravioli was so good we went back a couple of days later to pick up a tray of them for Christmas dinner. The location is Way outside of my normal stomping grounds but worth the effort. Will return(often)."}
{"text":"I use the words \"tasty\", \"delicious\", and \"fantastic\" frequently when I'm writing reviews.  It's time for a new word.  Sublime.  That's how I would describe the pastrami from this deli.  I didn't get a very good picture because I had picked up some food to go and then met my husband for lunch at his office and we were sitting outside, but next time, I'll get a food porn shot to end all food porn shots of that pastrami.  Get it.  That's all you need to know.  Full of flavor and will almost melt in your mouth.  We also tried the half sandwich on homemade bread with salami, prosciutto, and asiago.  Hooked up with the works, that one was...let me find another new word...that sub was classic.  The homemade bread is soft and chewy and the deli meats are tender and full of flavor.  Asiago adds a nice spark of flavor and the lettuce and other toppings round it out to make a perfect sandwich.  I am thrilled I don't have to drive all the way to Defalco's to get a sandwich like this.  I did not see Emilie, but Carlo is completely charming and was singing while he was preparing the food.    Don't even get me started on the dessert counter.  I can't look at it.  It's too beautiful.  If you don't want to have to buy larger pants, don't look at it either.  One glance and it was a blur of chocolate and cannoli and carrot cake.  I can't take it.    The high reviews are well-deserved.  It took me awhile to visit for the first time, but it won't take long for me to make a return visit."}
{"text":"Had lunch on Friday and ordered a full capocollo, salame, and asiago cheese sandwich.  The full is a pretty good deal with the amount of meat that they give and so is the half sandwich.  The sandwich was very tasty.  I ate half and brought the other half for my family and they gobbled it up.  Lunchtime was busy so we had to wait a couple of minutes for a table to leave as the deli doesn't have too many tables.  There were tables outside, but I didn't want to sweat to death outside during summer.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The owners are hands on an all of the homemade food is amazing. Whether you're close or far I'd call and pick something up at the very least. They make their own bread and it was part of the best meatball sub I've ever had. I'm 125 years old, so that means something. Seriously though, get some food from this place. They have amazing deserts on display as well, but I figure I'll have to start with them next time. Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here for my birthday lunch. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the owners.  They were very nice and checked on us a few times while we were eating.  The butternut squash ravioli was very tasty and we split a tiramisu which was one of the best we've ever had!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! I go there a fair amount and it never disappoints. I almost don't want to tell people about this place because I fear it will become too busy, but I have to give this place props as it is so good every time I go.  Also knowing it is a small business I feel they deserve the credit for providing such a great experience every time. From the minute you walk in you feel like family and think you are in a small local deli of NYC. After the warm welcome you get to pick from a wonderful menu, so far everything I have had is outstanding. I have tried several pastas, almost every sandwich and many of the specials and I love them all.  My favorites and go to's are the cold sandwiches but you can't go wrong. Then if by any chance you have room for dessert try them they will amaze you.  Do yourself a favor and go, you will be hooked.   Btw the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is great! Every time I come here the food tastes delicious and the service is top notch! The owners are very nice people. So far I have tried the meatball sub, Chicken parm, and the meat lasagna! All done right and very tasty! The deserts they have are my favorite here in the valley. My favorite is the lemon cake! Mmmmm. It is so nice to have a place like this close to my house!"}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch today -- my first visit. My son and husband had been the week before and loved it. Sandwiches are so flavorful and the bread is great, both the baguette and Carlo's bread. The cannoli was amazing, made fresh just as we ordered. So glad to find this place so close to home. We'll be telling all our friends and family!"}
{"text":"Delicious eggplant parm. Emilie is delightful. The carrot cake is really, really good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful deli.  Met the owner within a few minutes of walking in.  Restaurant has typical deli fare - but done wonderfully.  Coworkers picked up meatballs and said they were the best they've had.  I had the #2 (cold sandwich), best cold cut sandwhich i've had.  REALLY wanted to get espresso and desserts (they look amazing).  Will come back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this new authentic Italian deli! We had a homemade meatball sandwich on a baguette, and a turkey sandwich with peppers fresh cheeses on fresh made bread! Delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"$6.50 for sfogliatelle that costs less than $1 on the streets of Rome, and the Roman pastry is fresher and tastier. This place takes advantage because Americans dont know any better! No Italian would pay these prices for mediocre quality, highway ROBBERY!!"}
{"text":"Ate there the other day had spaghetti with Bolognese sauce. The food was great Carlos singing was great."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for me.  I agree with what all the other Yelpers have said.  Good service, good food, good prices.  I will go back again and try something different the next time.  Very happy with this place."}
{"text":"BEST Italian food around!!!  You can tell everything is homemade  and the customer service is OUTSTANDING... they always make you feel right at home!!!"}
{"text":"I  ate here for lunch on Friday and was greeted by the person behind the counter. I  mentioned that it was my first time there and I received a few recommendations which I enjoy. I  was greeted by another staff member and felt very welcomed. I ordered the cheese tortellini, with sausage and bolongese sauce. Someone brought me my food and got me utensils and napkins and I started to eat. The tortellini's were perfect and the meat from the sauce were in every bite. The owner came out as well and greeted me. The only thing I didn't like was I thought the sauce was a bit watered down. I know real Italian sauce is a bit watery and they make it true to the Italian culture. It's not a deal breaker for me. They have multiple different sauces so I will return. The staff there was great and that alone is worth coming back for."}
{"text":"I have been on a search for a long time for a solid deli and finally have found one. This hidden gem makes some killer Italian favorites as well as excellent sandwiches made with fresh baked breads and gourmet meats and cheeses. My favorite is the pastrami which is loaded up with meat and cheese. Second favorite is the cold turkey sandwich which is massive and enough for 2 people. Their homemade chips are also very good!"}
{"text":"Let me start with everything on the menu sounds good, but I went with soup of the day cream of mushroom and it was delicious.  It came with a 1/2 sandwich so I choose the #9 on a crusty baguette.  The sliced meats were so good, included asiago cheese, sopressata & capacollo.  It was fantastic.  My mom had some of the homemade bread which was very good.  They also catered to my sisters celiac with some tasty GF pasta with meat sauce.  I look forward to going back and trying new items and some of the desserts esp tiramisu.  The employees were helpful and very friendly.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"A delicious hot pastrami with grilled onions and swiss on a baked baguette. Just too good. The sandwich had loads of pastrami, it was huge (taking half back to casa). Returned for round two of pesto pasta, fresh and scrumptious. Followed up with made in house creme pastry and espresso, simply the best. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"We are SAD to have found this place just weeks before we move out of town. If you know the difference between chain Italian and really quality Italian; if your bar is higher than almost any place you can find in the Phoenix metro area because you know better--this is the place for you. This is not fine dining atmosphere, but deli with a friendly European bistro vibe. We met Emilie, one of the owners, who took our order and delivered the food. She was charming, authentic, passionate and, well, European. A delight! Sandwiches were best we have had in maybe 20 years (both lived in NJ/NY), lasagna was sublime, not as heavy as we have been led to believe it has to be and with a simple, rustic, yet uniquely balanced flavor profile. My wife claimed the tiramisu was as good as she has ever had. A complete gem of a find in an otherwise desert (get it?) of good food."}
{"text":"Came here based on the great reviews. It was eh. Homemade bread was yeasty tasting. No wheat option at all. Asked for plain grilled veggie sandwich. Told it came plain. Served to me with pesto aioli. Sent back. Came back to me very greasy. Grilled veggies seem to have been sautéed veggies. Bread was soggy and oily. Service was friendly. Asked to tip before order even came out. I'd not recommend."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for a lunch date we had that was long overdue.  She is a foodie, so when she recommends somewhere I never give it another thought.  This place did not disappoint.  It's a Diamond in the rough.  You feel like you are a part of the family when you are there.  And the smells coming out of the kitchen are to die for.  And the fresh made bread... oh my word!!!  I had the Butternut Squash and it was the best thing ever!! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is perhaps the best Italian restaurant we have been to.  The food is very fresh and homemade. The gluten free pasta was cooked to perfection. The staff is super friendly.   We recommend everyone to eat here.   You'll be very glad you did."}
{"text":"Immediately, I was impressed with the greeting from everyone. I felt like part of a family. The food is fresh and delicious. I had the antipasto; my husband had the turkey Asiago on crispy bread. They do no skimp on the meats and cheeses. Get out and try it while it's nice outside. The patio was delightful. I will be coming back here as much as I can!  I'm looking forward to trying a hot sandwich and the pasta."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing. Tonight we had the spaghetti with meat ballls, lasagne and antipasto salad. All wonderful as usual. We have yet to find anything not worth recommending at this place - oh and you must try the desserts!!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. I had a number 9 sub and a side salad. Both were delicious. It looks like they offer pastas which sound tempting. Finally, the desserts look incredible. I will be back here again."}
{"text":"First thing I did when I walked in and saw the dessert and deli cases was salivate!! This is now my favorite samich shop and my buddy's as well!  I had the number 5 on the homemade bread with pesto and sun dried tomatoes. My buddy had the number 9 with the same bread. The whole is huge, I can't wait until I am hungry again to eat the second half! I can't wait to bring my wife there and try all the pasta and other mouthwatering entrees and desserts! The prices are great and the people there are wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little Italian deli in the most inconspicuous location. The butternut squash ravioli was delicious and would strongly recommend it. The pesto chicken sandwich was also very tasty. My son had the meatball sandwich and his verdict was \"best ever\"!  We also had a slice of the homemade triple chocolate cake which was outstanding as well. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Best Italian good around! Emilie is so sweet and makes amazing suggestions on what have or what to pair your food with. And Carlo truly cares that you are enjoying your meal and always checks in with you to see what you think. My hubs always gets their sandwiches (though based off Emilie's suggestions the sandwich is different each time) and I generally get the tortellini with for cheese sauce. We just tried the chocolate and plain cannoli today and they were mouthwatering! Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Stopped by casually after seeing the other reviews on yelp and i wasn't disappointed.  My wife and I shared a whole sandwich and it was more than enough.  We also really enjoyed the cream of potato soup.  You could definitely tell it was homemade.  The highlight of the trip may have been the chocolate mouse.    Service was great.  They'll pretty much make you whatever you want if they have the ingredients.    I wish i lived closer so i could go back more often."}
{"text":"We should all pay more money so this place will be around for ever ... Homemade sausage was crazy good ..this reminds me a little Italian grocery store in New York . This place is a home run ... There prices are way to low for this Quality. Home made was also very good  Be back soon dam I had have cannoli then bought 6 togo.. Glad I live in Maui I would grain 50 pounds  Good job the owner is very personable .."}
{"text":"Great find for lunch!! We will be back!! Best pastrami sandwich I've ever had in Arizona. Owner was friendly and made us feel really welcome."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try and was disappointed. On the pricy side, not stunning portions, and absolutely no flavor in the pasta sauce. Garlic bread was just bread, nothing garlicky about it."}
{"text":"We came here to try it today for a quick Mother's Day lunch. WOW. There are no words to describe how delicious everything was! Husband had the pastrami, I don't like pastrami and it was delish! Daughter had Spaghetti, best marinara I've ever tried. I had the antipasto salad, amazing!!!! Then we all shared the triple chocolate cake...great!  Service phenomenal, food outstanding, and the owner Emilie was so gracious. We will  e back soon, and often!!"}
{"text":"I come here just to eat the eggplant. It's so tender and tasty! The deli is tucked away in a strip mall with the Frys grocery store as the anchor. It's a small deli with Italian deli meats and pastries. The menu in located on a chalk board and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I ordered the eggplant that is almost exactly the way my mother makes it. I noticed the crumb cake in the case and I should have ordered one piece to go. It looked just like REAL crumb cake! More crumbs than cake... I will definitely grab one next time. There is a small out door area that is mostly covered with tables to dine at. We love to come here and I also must say how nice it was for the owner to visit our table to make sure we were doing well. Don't see that in today's world much."}
{"text":"Found this place using Yelp.  It sounded good, a deli with freshly made food.  I had the meatballs sandwich and a side of pasta salad. The meatball sandwich seemed a little plain to me, although the cheese was very tasty and helped.  For fresh made meatballs, I really couldn't taste any seasoning too much. The pasta salad did taste fresh, and I thought it was well done.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"This is great! Service was quick and the food is as good as promised. There were four of us and one had a pastrami and claimed it is the best pastrami he has had in this state. The owner greeted us personally and gave us a sample of a special he makes on Tuesdays and boy, was it tasty! It's a rolled chicken stuffed with cheese, mushrooms and sausage. If I lived here I would make a point to come back for that dish. We ended our meal with coffee and tiramisu and both are very good.i HIGHLY recommend this place"}
{"text":"We love this place. We recently changed cities and were looking for little spots closer to our new abode, and this is a gem. Emilie is so sweet and welcoming - Carlo is too, we just see Emilie more often! I love their gnocchi in four cheese sauce, tender gnocchi and a homemade delicate sauce that will make your tastebuds happy. Our daughter gets the tortellini and they are just as delicious as the gnocchi. Oh, and their meatballs are amazing too. We often order one or two on the side to share, they have the perfect texture and flavor. We have also ordered the butternut ravioli with the sage and brown butter sauce - the pasta is slightly sweet and that sauce is just the right compliment to the pasta. It's a memorable dish :) My hubby has had a few sandwiches and loved them all so far!   Love this place. We dine in or take out every other week at least."}
{"text":"What can I say - pretty amazing. Nice service, the food was soooo good. Everything is fresh, homemade - a true little European sandwich shop in the heart of Chandler. Highly recommend!! Oh wait - have I mentioned the fresh amazing homemade desserts? And cheeses, smoked meats that you can buy to take home? Love it, absolutely love it! :)"}
{"text":"Went with wife for lunch and chose this place for two reasons.  One, it was close to my eye doctor's office where I had a 1pm appointment and two, Yelp had very nice reviews of it!  Please note that there are two sizes of sandwiches, a half (6\") and a whole (12\") and they pack in so much meat and accompaniments that a large would be rather difficult to consume.  It's a small deli but they have a nice size patio and lots of Italian pasta dishes. 8, as well as 13 hot sandwiches and 10 cold sandwiches, plus soup and salads.  She ordered a small pastrami sandwich with yellow mustard, cheese, and sauted onions and, half a dill pickle.  I had a small cheese and onion steak sandwich.  We also had their home made potato chips. They were very good but a very small portion considering the $1.30 charge. We drank the usual self serve lemonade.  There was so much lean and tasty meat in the sandwiches but mine was \"dry\" and had to be chewed a lot.  It really needed some sort of moisture, a sauce perhaps.  We will return for some of the pasta dishes, they looked very good."}
{"text":"Came across a Restaurant.com certificate for this.  So when we show up there is a meat case selling salame and a few other things, and a really big blackboard listing all their sandwiches.  They have both hot and cold sandwiches.  It took a while to make a choice.  I ordered the (hot) pork sausage, and my wife ordered the (cold) salame, prosciutto, asiago, mortadella.  Plus we got the beef soup.  You can order half or whole sandwiches except for one or two of their sandwiches.  They have their own in-house made bread, too.  When the sandwiches arrived they were very big.  We both liked our choices, and the beef soup too!  One thing about their bread is that it is not wimpy sliced bread from the store.  It's crusty and chewy.  The bite force necessary to get a bite sends the other ingredients shooting out the other side!  I ended up using a knife a fork instead.  This is a good neighborhood deli.  Not like Subway or Quiznos.  Much better.  Better ingredients, more choices, better bread.  And it's not a chain, it's owned by a couple.  I think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Very nice little sandwich and lunch shop. Wonderful staff. Authentic Italian good with simple ingredient components that make excellent tastes. I enjoyed a beef sandwich that was very good, and I tried a meat ravioli and some spaghetti with real ragu sauce as well. All of then came with excellent home cooked breads. I also tried the soup of the day which was a perfect complement.  Prices are slightly higher than most lunch shops of the same style but this is real Italian cooking not American Italian sandwiches.   Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is perfect, prices are good, Emilie and Carlo are angels :) See you soon!"}
{"text":"Been here twice both times I have ordered the butternut squash ravioli. First time I got a side of meatball and pork sausage.  I wasn't a big fan of the meatball. It seemed really overcooked steamed. It seemed really soggy. I have no clue what was up with that but I just thought I'd try it.   Sausage was great compared to the meatball!  I stopped in again today because I was craving the butternut squash ravioli with sausage. I normally order for pick up because I work around the corner and had to run back. But if I wasn't working the place isn't really the ideal place to eat at because it's small there's a courtyard outside but when summer comes, everyone's going to want to be inside.  They have a pretty nice selection of homemade desserts. I wanted to try but at the same time I want to stay fit so I can't give you guys any feedback on how those tasted."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Food was phenomenal.  Will be back antipasto salad was fresh and tasty. Y Beef Braciola was spot on."}
{"text":"The first few times we came here we would have given it a better rating, but the last 2 times the service and food have both been sub-par at best. We go for the pastrami sandwich, which has been 1/3 or more fat the last two visits. The co-owner, Emilie, is rude, unwelcoming and not friendly at all. The younger staff that work there are all very nice and helpful and at times try to make up for the rudeness of the owner even, its as if they themselves are embarrassed by how she acts. The prices are high for what you get. The location is cute with a nice outside patio.....just need better quality, prices and service!"}
{"text":"I love a good Italian Sub and Carlo & Emilie's knows how it's done.  I got the Parma Prosciutto Sub and subbed out Asiago for housemade fresh mozzarella and extra roasted red peppers on a crunchy baguette and it was perfect!  This is the best sandwich I have had since moving hear from Santa Monica where I used to eat at Bay Cities Italian Deli all the time (world renowned deli)!  If you like a really good Italian deli, you must try them out!"}
{"text":"So Yummy!!! Emilie took our order. When asked what she feels is best to order, she without a doubt gave us great suggestions and even some samples! This place takes pride in their work and it shows in the flavor of their food to their customer service! Everything had great flavor! We got the antipasto to share and it's a big portion to split between four people with our own entrees. We got penne with the homemade tomato sauce and homemade sausage.The sauce was full of flavor and the pasta was definitely el dente! We also got the sopressata, capocollo, and asiago cheese half sandwich and DELICIOUS HOMEMADE CHIPS!!!! Gail and I chose the mascarpone and butternut squash raviolis with sage and quasi burned butter. The raviolis were phenomenal! Everything was super delicious. For dessert we had cannoli, tiramisu, and profiterole. I would say that the dessert were good but we got the tiramisu when it JUST got done being made so it didn't quite \"set\" and the coffee liquor was a bit much in my opinion. cannoli was good, crispy and light. Profiterole is profiterole, I wouldn't say it stood out as much as the others. Overall this place is a must try! Love the food and pride they put in it. Customer service is definitely exceptional. Thank you for your great business operation."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!!! I have had many great experiences there, the staff is awesome :) Their meatball sub as well as many of their daily specials have impressed me! The food is authentically produced from scratch and fresh daily. You can taste the passion they have for food from the first bite. Having a family owned place like this in the area has been wonderful and they have so much to offer. I'm looking forward to ordering food for work events and for parties I host at home. Thank you Carlo and Emilie for the passion you have for food and for sharing it with me!!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian deli owned and operated by real genuine folks.  Friendly and very helpful service at the counter. Short waiting time for lunch and the food was amazing! Absolutely loved the eggplant parmesan (recommended by the gal behind the counter) the antipasto salad is must try too! Generous servings and homemade bread, sauce, and more! Don't pass by this little gem!"}
{"text":"Every neighborhood needs a deli like this. Mine doesn't have one but I gladly make the drive because this spot is definitely worth it.   A great selection of cold cuts, freshly baked breads and a simple yet delicious variety of authentic Italian staples to choose from on the menu. Make sure to save some room for a cannoli or some of Carlo's famous tiramisu.  Large portions made in house with quality ingredients and reasonably priced. One of my favorites is the Beef Braciola but you can never go wrong with the meatballs either...  Carlo and his crew are amazing. A great place to keep in mind for catering small parties or corporate luncheons."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the portions are huge. I have tried several different sandwiches and deserts and everything has been over the top! The tiramisu is the best I have had in a long time. I am looking forward to trying one of the pasta dishes on a future trip. Everyone is so friendly here that it leaves you wanting to return again. We will definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has nearly 5 stars? We had the chicken parmesan sandwich and it was the blandest I've ever had. The chicken and breading had no flavor and the sauce just tasted like tomato sauce? Waste of money, we threw them away after trying several bites hoping it would get better. I was really sad because I *wanted* to love this place. Guess I'll continue to make the drive to DeFalcos for my chicken parm sandwich craving.  The ratings are so high from other yelpers that I'll go back and try something else and update my review but until then I'm just bummed!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place especially because it is close to my home and we love local Restaurants.Also,the concept of a Deli set up which is supposed to be like DeFalco's in Scottsdale. This is the first time I ordered at Carlo & Emilie's and had it as take out. I ordered for 6 people and unfortunately we did not like the food. Perhaps they were having a bad day. My elderly dad had their Meatball Sandwich and the bread was very soggy,and very difficult to eat. He did like the meatballs as I tried it also and they were good,not great,but good. My mom got their Pastrami Sandwich which was good. My wife tried their Meat Lasagna and it tasted a little like Chef Boyardee. I had the Chicken Parm Sandwich and it too was soggy and very hard to eat. The chicken itself had an odd taste for which I couldn't eat it. My daughter had their Mascarpone Cheese Butternut Squash Ravioli and was suppose to get the Fresh Sage Sauce with it. Unfortunately it wasn't on it. So it was a bit dry. My daughters Boyfriend had their Meat Tortellini which he liked, Then for dessert we all had a Cannoli which was good,not great but good. I really wanted to like their food,but it was disappointing to all of us. I do wish them well and since there are good reviews,perhaps many like the food,but to us,it wasn't very good.A few were better than others,and that is why I gave it a 3 star. I might try it again to see if it gets better. I do hope so.."}
{"text":"This place has the best pastrami sandwich I have had in a very very long time. The next time I'm in town I will definitely be stopping by for another pastrami sandwich on rye bread. The staff was very very friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian! Authentic and delicious! Reasonable prices! Quaint atmosphere! Love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint!  We are hooked on their homemade soups.......full disclosure....we love the Wednesday special of Cream of Potato with homemade bacon so much we rarely go on a different day!  We did go a couple of times for the Beef Vegetable and that was to die for as well!  Italian sub sandwiches on a crispy french baguette is our favorite.  Today I saw others with some of their homemade entrees and they looked fabulous!  Very friendly and delicious!"}
{"text":"We decided to grab sandwiches on our moving day, and boy were we glad we did!  The sandwiches are HUGE, fresh and delicious!  The service was great (we called in a to go order).  I can't wait to go back again, and to try the tiramisu, which I have been informed is the best in Arizona ..."}
{"text":"Fabulous...we had penne, bolognese, meatballs and marscarpone cheese and butternut squash ravioli.  Finished with a cannoli.  Interesting that dishs come out one at a time but all of it is truly homemade and you can tell. So glad we discovered this little gem!"}
{"text":"Our family really enjoys this restaurant. European food (Italian and French) done well. No frills, just good food.  They the bread: it is amazing! Fresh pastas and great soups. Never tried the desserts, although they look wonderful.  Take your family and enjoy good and simple food made with great ingredients."}
{"text":"Best Italian dishes. My chicken parm was luscious and my husband's brasciola on baguette was best I ever ate.  Quality food and expertly prepared."}
{"text":"I've eaten twice at this deli and am quickly becoming a regular. If you're looking for gourmet sandwiches at a fair price in the Chandler/ocotillo area, look no further :)  Bravo!"}
{"text":"So glad we got here before they closed @7! The eggplant parmigiana is tremendous! The entire dish is outstanding, however, the red gravy (sauce) has such a complex flavor that I savored every bite I sopped up with my crusty bread.   I eyed all the deserts, but opted for none. I'm regretting that now. Lots of choices & all my favorites."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Owner was very friendly and greeted everyone. Got the chicken pesto and it was very good."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find this place since I was in the mood for a REAL sandwich..not from a chain. I ordered the Salami and Asiago cheese. Wowow!! Very good and LOVED the Asiago cheese. All sandwiches come with mustard, lettuce, tomato, onions and vinaigrette. Really good flavor. I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. Also picked up lasagna for dinner and will review that later. I'll be back! ."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Italy. The food is so simple yet so flavorful. The fresh meat is better than any quality deli meat than you can find around here. The homemade meatballs are just like grandma use to make :)"}
{"text":"Overrated! While the homemade bread was good, the chicken parm came out cold, cheese was not melted by any means, had no flavor and the sauce was cold and bland. My fiancé had the cheese and steak sandwich which he also said was meh! Also lacking flavor. Our son's chicken melt was probably the better choice. I love cannolis and it was awful, whipped cream filling and flavorless air shell. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing homemade sausage sandwich today, you can taste the love in the food, Carlos is always super friendly and grateful! Check it out if you're looking for some authenticity!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! My family ordered a meatball sandwich, penne pasta and a cold capocollo sandwich. Everything was so fresh. Coming back often."}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with this Deli! And the Yelpers who said you need to try the butternut squash ravioli were right. It's a whole new pasta-eating experience.  I've seen other restaurants at this location slowly fade away and close. Gourmet Deli seems to have a constant stream of regulars keeping them afloat, and I'm proud to be one of them. Their sandwiches, their pastas, and their tiramisu, all outstanding. A definite must!"}
{"text":"Placed a phone order to pick up. The order was ready on time. Very friendly was greeted by several employees. Had the butternut squash ravioli and chicken parmigiana sandwich. The full sandwich was almost to much to eat, glad I was hungry. I will be back. My wife loved the house salad, it had artichokes!!"}
{"text":"Wow! The sausage is amazing!  I will come back for that alone, however the gluten free pasta was fabulous as well. I ordered the fettuccine sauce with sun dried tomatoes which was a little runny, but the sausage came in the tomato sauce, and when combined was perfection. The service was great, delightful and friendly. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Umm Dude this place was great and we will be back! Service was helpful and kind, the food was delectable, and quite reasonable in price. Clearly there are regulars who frequent the place and are known--always a great sign of a quality eatery. I had a sausage sandwich and my wife had what she says was the \"best sandwich she has ever had\"-- a sorpresata, capicola, and asiago cheese combination on their amazing homemade bread. When we go back it will be hard to try something else as those were winners!"}
{"text":"What can I say that already hasn't been said?  How about this: The cannolis and tiramisu are amazing. And I am from New York; I know what I'm talking about.  Also - the steak sandwich on a baguette with garlic butter is my new craving now. The ribeye cuts with a dinner knife.  Bottom line: If you are looking to impress your work friends with a hole-in-the-wall gem, this is the cream of the crop."}
{"text":"New place.  What a pleasant surprise!  Great chow and very friendly people.  Pasta and hot and cold sandwiches.  Licked my plate.  Try the pastrami with sautéed onions on rye.  Guarantee will put a smile on your face.  My new favorite place."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant.  They use the highest quality ingredients and know how to cook with them.  I had soup, a hot beef sandwich and the apple pie.  My Wife had the Salami and asiago and a cannoli.  The bread was a fresh homemade french baguette.  It was the kind you would get in New York.  The meats were high quality and piled high.  The apple pie was the best I have ever had and the cannoli was very good.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Next time I want to try the pastas."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE This place!!  The owner is so friendly and helpful.  Everything is delicious but we especially love his homemade focaccia and pasta - to die for."}
{"text":"So good!!! I got the roast beef sandwich and my boyfriend got a cold Italian sandwich and both were so amazing! They were also very well priced, the small was HUGE and only $6.50! We also got a side of the pasta salad and it was so big & delicious. We will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Love the food everything is delicious!!! We had the chicken burgers is perfection the meatballs sandwich so great the have for dessert chocolate mousse tiramisu mmmm great"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than 5 stars! You won't be disappointed I promise .. It's a tiny little deli with seemingly endless choices . I had the #5 cold Sammy on baguette . I ordered the whole instead of the half, next time I will Know better &  get the half. The bread was crusty and crunchy on the outside and soft and squishy on the inside .. meats and cheeses were high quality and freshly sliced . I haven't had an Italian Sammy this good since I left Connecticut .. This is real deal Italian."}
{"text":"I've been excited to try this place out based on reviews and it didn't disappoint.  Authentic Italian delis are hard to come by in the East Valley and this one measures up to my favorites in New York and New Jersey where I grew up.  4 of us split two antipasto salads and a large #2 which is to die for.  A large sandwich made on their homemade bread is really two full small sandwiches.  Plenty of food.  Run, do not walk here!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood eatery!!!  Fresh pasta, and sauces.  Everything I have had is delicious.  Make sure to get there prior to closing because they shut down a little early.  I would not bother if it is within 30 mins of closing.  Food, and desserts make up for it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my family.  The food has been good both times and deserts are excellent.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. Hot & cold sandwiches fresh made are simple & tasty."}
{"text":"Had to re-try the dish I wasn't too crazy for and this time it's was on point.  Plenty of Butter and plenty of flavor."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The food is freshly prepared and always good.  The Limoncello cake is to die for, Carlo's fresh breads and Emily's soups are the best.    The friendly atmosphere makes this a pleasant place to relax and pretend you're on vacation and the staff is always accomodating."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch today, we have been waiting to try this deli for quite a while.  As soon as you enter through the doors, you are nicely greeted by Carlos and Emilie, the owners, who by the way, are extremely nice! We ordered the homemade lasagna as well as a cold sandwich (#8). Everything was delicious, you could tell that everything was fresh and homemade. I personally loved the atmosphere! We tried the tiramisu and the Profiterole Pralinée, even after this nice meal we had to finish the desserts because they were so good!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. The pasta salad was delicious. The sandwich was very flavorful and had a generous portion of meat. The owner (I think he was the owner) was so nice, and even brought out a plate of some chicken he made for us to sample. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the reviews I was super excited to find a great Italian deli on the East side. DiFalcos and Guidos in Scottsdale are two of my favorites but the drive from Gilbert can be rough with traffic. The menu looked nice but I was very disappointed that all  of their cold sandwiches came with Asiago instead of fresh mozzarella. I substituted provolone instead. Also all of the sandwiches come with mustard which I'm not a fan of. I had the #2 on their homemade bread that was hard and stale. The sandwich didn't have any flavor at all. Very disappointing.  All of the desserts in the case were pre-cut with pieces of paper separating the slices which screamed that they were not homemade. Disappointing again.  I wanted this place to be good so I wouldn't have to drive to Scottsdale anymore but it just didn't happen, sadly."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great prices.  Super friendly staff.  I'm a fan!  Good italian food is, to me, the best cuisine.  This place has good italian food and they have it in any variety you want.  There are sandwiches, pasta dishes and desserts.  This is a great fast lunch or you could sit down on the patio and make a long meal out of it.  I had the chicken parm sub and it was very good as was the cannoli (filling made on site).    The subs are gigantic so get the half if you're rolling solo.  Actually, check that.  Live for once and get the full sub.  Save half for later if you must."}
{"text":"one of the best Italian places I've been to in a long time! small place but that's where you find the best stuff! friendly staff and the owners are very nice and actually talk to you! I definitely recommend going here. lasagna is to die for it is home made with two different sauces along with the buttery garlic bread. For dessert I had their tiramisu, it is delicious and also made there! my mom got the spaghetti and meatballs and she absolutely  loved it! definitely will be coming back here, especially with their great customer service and everything home made!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken burger and pasta salad it was all fresh and tasted fantastic! Owner came out and talked to us also, really friendly guy. Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food. Very informal and nice outside sitting area. Worth a trip and they cater too! Carlo the owner is awesome!"}
{"text":"We did the meatball sandwich and meat lasagna.  Both were delicious.  Small spot kind of tucked away.  It's worth your time to stop by and get some eats."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for months, and finally came in tonight.  It was so good, we will be back a LOT more.  I only order some food to go - spaghetti puttanesca with homemade pork sausage and lots of meatballs.  It was so simple, and so perfect.  Easily some of the best meatballs I've had in Phoenix, and the sausage was amazing.  Great pasta, and a slice of really good crusty garlic bread.  The guy made the sauce to order with capers and no olives (I hate olives).  It was absolutely delicious - complete torture driving home with the scent of that food in the car.  But the best part was the people.  Friendly, helpful, and accommodating - the kind of place that you want to give your business to.  I can't wait to go back and try other menu items.  What a gem"}
{"text":"Great customer service from Carlo himself! Things were busy as the lunch crowd swarmed in (always a good sign), and we needed a to-go box and our missing cannoli. Carlos was happy to help! Great food too--with portion sizes so huge (even the half-sandwich is a monstrosity) we took some home."}
{"text":"Definitely not anywhere near 4.5 stars! The ravioli, lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs,  and salad were ok.  Nothing fancy.  The turkey sandwich was made with cheap store bought wheat bread and it was very dry.  The kids ordered a pizza and it was disgusting! It was obviously frozen pizza that was heated in the microwave. The staff was not personable or helpful.  When we were leaving and said bye they finally asked how everything was.  When we gave them the feedback on the pizza she replied that she knows they are just frozen and next time we should try the grilled cheese for the kids.  We then asked why she didn't tell us this when we ordered and she said oh sorry....   There are definitely better places to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the first time, had the chicken parmigiana and Italian wedding soup (soup of the day) good flavors all around! I'll sure to be back to try something else of their menu!"}
{"text":"This deli is amazing! Carlo always takes care of his customers! My first time there he let me try a cannoli! I love their mascarpone with butternut squash ravioli! It's amazing! Also, their pastrami hot sandwich is delicious also! All around a great place to eat! Thank you for being so nice every time we go in!"}
{"text":"Nice going you guys! The vibe reminded me of the Italian delis back in Little Italy in the Bronx where I used to live: small but welcoming with all my favorite recipes written on a chalkboard behind the counter. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese while my wife ordered the antipasta. Both portions were large. The salad was fresh with plenty of salami and cheese. My spaghetti was excellent. It had a generous amount of hamburg and the sauce was very tasty. The server and the owner Carlo both came over at different times to check if we enjoyed the meal. We will be returning there soon."}
{"text":"Friends had mentioned what a gem this place is, so we tried it tonight.  OMG...reminds me of all the great storefront restaurants we are used to back in Chicago.  The beef braciole was a large portion of tender beef in a flavorful tomato sauce (\"gravy\" if you are Italian!). My husband ordered the chicken Parm sandwich and couldn't finish it.  We also tried the pasta salad, with artichokes, roasted red peppers, fresh Parmesan and olives...a huge portion for $3! We ordered carry-out; everything was carefully packaged... I like the idea that they packaged the rolls for the sandwiches separately, so the bread would not get soggy --- good idea! Five hours later and I am still full. We will be back soon---great prices, top quality food, and friendly personnel!"}
{"text":"4 of us had lunch there last Saturday, really tasty and reasonable. We had the spaghetti puttanesca, chicken parm, eggplant parm and a couple salads. They had run out of Italian sausage, so I wasn't able to add it to the plate, but the meatball was very good. Cannoli was a nice dessert to take home and enjoy later. We'll be back to try more items, might make 5 stars if the Italian sausage is as good as other reviews have it."}
{"text":"I saw this on yelp and decided to stop. The customer service is amazing. I got the eggplant parmigiana sandwich. I wasn't blown away by the dish, it was mushy and the bread was thick. I ordered the roast beef for my husband, we had to request for the au jus. For dessert we ordered the tiramisu which we weren't informed had three types of alcohol, the bottom had looked moldy but the lady stated that is how tiramisu looks. I was disappointed due to all the ratings for this place."}
{"text":"A deli-licious update! The service here was excellent and the Italian gentleman at the counter was giving out sample stromboli pieces that he had just baked which were heavenly. I shared some braciole and a #9 capicola/sopressata sandwich on homemade bread. The bread was superb this time, with a slightly crisp outer surface and soft delicious interior. The beef was very tender and flavorful in the braciole, and the cold sandwich was the perfect amount of meat, vegetables, and condiments. My friends had lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs which we all oohed and ahhed over. Everything was perfection. The only thing we regret was not having enough room in our stomach for some dessert! Upgrade one star!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. My boyfriend had the roasted chicken salad and I had tortalini with Alfredo. The portions were large and the food was fresh and delicious. We will definitely return. Only giving 4 stars due to it being very hot inside. Otherwise it was 5 star service and food."}
{"text":"Carlo the owner is amazing and hospitable. He really makes this place what is 5 stars. The complimentary Stromboli on Saturdays is terrific. I yet to try anything that didn't have me wanting to come back for more."}
{"text":"Oh Boy. What a great dinner experience there.   We have a group of six. I came first at around 6:20pm and my group arrived at about 6:35pm. We received a very friendly welcome, and the owner Carlo very kindly introduce their menu items to bunch people (at least me) who don't know much about Italian food. He also gave us a plate of meat to try out. All I want is lots meat, so I picked pastrami. I was more than happy to see the portion, because it's more I can chew. No surprise that I was the one finished my dinner first. It was very tasty.   We do feel sorry to the owner Emilie and her staff who patiently wait for us to finish our dinner. We did not know they close on Monday at 7:00PM.  We left at about 8pm. Ouch. They should told us that they close at 7pm.   We pick their restaurant because of Yelp reviews. There was 48 reviews with 5 star rating, which is unbelievably odd. So 6 of us decided to give it a try. We have no doubt that they will get 49 reviews and still deserves 5 star rating.   I also had a bite of the chocolate cake. Well. I wished I ate the chocolate cake before finsihing the pastrami sandwich. I will come back and try different items and take out the cake. Period."}
{"text":"This is a little gem hidden in Chandler. I drove a way to get here and it was worth every mile. I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and it as delicious!! It came with yummy garlic bread. My new spaghetti spot for sure!! The service was nothing, but friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's a cute little family owned and run cafe with amazing food, and great customer service! If you're in the area give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"After performing a search of \"Find: Meatball, Near: Chandler, AZ\" and stumbling upon the fantastic reviews for this place (many of which give praise to the almighty meatballs), I was pretty pumped (and a bumped) to try the meatball sub here.  Now since I got my order to-go, I kind of expected the bread to get soggy, which is exactly what happened.  Understandable.  Since the meatballs were HUGE, I decided to just separate them from the rest of the sandwich and eat the bread in between.  After the first bite from the outer edge of the meatball, I made note of two off-putting things.  1. The meat tasted quite bland, like there was barely any seasoning. 2. More importantly, I thought it was odd how soft/mushy the texture of the meatballs were so I cut them open and, to my dismay, found them to be quite under-cooked (still very pink) in the center.  UGHhhhhhHHHHHhhhhHHHHhhh  Luckily, the #3 cold sub (Mortadella, Salami, Prosciutto) was delicious so at least the entire experience wasn't a complete disappointment.  Also, the service was nice & friendly, so that's always a plus.  Needless to say, I will not be returning and will continue my quest for the one meatball sub to rule them all.  Grade: I don't always eat meatballs, but when I do...I prefer not to have to go numero dos immediately."}
{"text":"Tried this little place out that's located in the Fry's shopping center. Nice, super clean family owned deli restaurant. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Food was okay. The Chicken Pesto I had was a little over cooked and the bread was a little hard. We got there about 10 minutes before closing and didn't realize that they close early so that may be why the food was over cooked. The dessert's look awesome, but didn't have a chance to try them as they were putting those away for closing. Limited seating inside, but plenty of seating outside. My wife had the Chicken Parmigiana and it was okay too. Not bad, not great. Maybe another day I'll try it out and see if I like it better."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to eat here and wow was it worth it!!!    As soon as you walk in this feels like a  local, fresh, authentic Italian Deli.  I ordered the #3 sandwich with Salami, mortadella, and prosciutto.  It's comes in two sizes. (Half for $5 bucks and regular for $9). Well being my first time I wanted a full sandwich. Well to my surprise a half is literally like a. Full sandwich size and a regular is two of these. So much food for great prices!!   I had trouble finishing the one potion let alone two. But was looking forward to having it later for dinner.    Sandwich came with house made chips which were excellent.   I think I found my new favorite lunch spot for work!!"}
{"text":"Great place! We had to try it only because of the reviews, this is a true mom and pop shop. Owner was there to greet us, singing and yelling out orders. We had the meatball sandwich and his signature ravioli both were brought out fast. The only thing I would change is I like a meatball sandwich you can pick up, this one on the fresh baguette was a fork and knife job."}
{"text":"Meatball sandwich was amazing! We will be back to try the famous pork sausage. I have the feeling these guys are going to be around awhile."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Italian place in Phoenix. We tried Cheese Tortellini Alfredo, Penne Vodka and Spaghetti Puttanesca. All 3 were incredible. Will definitely be back.  Also, I might be in love with Emilie."}
{"text":"Very good food, friendly people that work there. Been here a few times in the past couple months. Really like the sandwiches. The half sandwiches are huge and very reasonable.  Much better than subway, jimmy johns, capriotties, etc. Tiramisu is a must have! I never order dessert out but every time I go here that is something I have to get."}
{"text":"Uhhhh Eggplant Sandwich!! The BEST!! Huge and so inexpensive, definitely good for two people! The eggplant is sliced thin, breaded, layered between a toasted baguette and the marinara sauce is delicious! My husband always gets the Chicken Parm Sandwich and loves it! They are quick and quality of food and service and great!"}
{"text":"so here we have a deli that has all kind of sandwiches that can be made as well as soups and salads as well as pasta, it's kind of like a deli and a restaurant put together. you will also have the option to buy desserts like tiramisu and crumb cake just to name a few. he also sells pasta imported from Tuscany, Italy that you can take home with you and cook yourself. all in all i love this place and the owner Carlo who walks around singing sweet home Alabama how cool is that Lol ???"}
{"text":"Ok I have been using yelp for several years but after eating lunch here today I finally decided to create an account because I had such a great meal here today. I always  like to support private and family businesses. So my wife and I tired it. What a great experience! Friendly knowledgeable staff. Wonderful homade meals!!! I had the tortellini with meat sauce best I have had in a very long time. Reminded me of Boston's North End.  My wife had the butternut squash ravioli with butter sauce. She loved it so much she encouraged me to sign up in yelp and write this review!   I am so glad and grateful to have a family run place I can eat at that makes wonderful homade food!!! The deserts looked great, I will have to try them next time! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I visited again last week, and I'm still so impressed! Everything I've had here is amazing. I love trying out local businesses instead of chain! I definitely recommend you try it out. I tried to warn my husband that their sandwiches were big, but he didn't listen so he had leftovers for the next day! :)"}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is always freah and made to order. Carlo, Emelie, and all the staff are always very kind and helpful. Not to mention thier fresh made deserts are amazing!"}
{"text":"Coming from an Italian family, I know the importance of having a reliable Italian deli in your neighborhood. But there's been a gap since the New Jersey Deli closed in North Phoenix years ago. I'm happy to say my heart is full again knowing Carlo & Emilie's is nearby.   Carlo is a wonderful business owner. On my dad's birthday, he insisted I take him a loaf of his favorite bread, and I came back soon after to let him know my dad loved it.  The food is comforting and consistently delicious. I've had the soups, sandwiches, salads and desserts and I've left happy every time.  On your next visit, try any of the hot subs or a slice of tiramisu."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I stopped by here today to inject some variety into our lunch rotation. I'm not sure why we never tried this place out sooner - I feel like we've been missing out!   They have a good selection of both hot and cold Italian sandwiches and some really good looking pasta dishes with several different sauces to chose from. I went for a cold #9 (Sopressata, Capocollo and Asiago cheese with everything on it except mustard - delicious!  My buddy ordered the homemade pork sausages served with bread and they were equally as good. The portions are very generous. I ordered a full sandwich and it was the equivalent of two individual sandwiches - easily enough to feed two people.  The staff here is also extremely friendly - Emilie was very helpful in taking or orders and explaining the different options they offer for various sandwiches. She also shared some bread options for our sandwiches that were not on the board - so always be sure to ask or you might be missing out on something great!  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a real Italian deli...being from the Northeastern part of the U.S.you can easily find one. This not so much...I got a salami, prosciutto and mortadella sandwich with asiago cheese with vinaigrette  which was flavorless. Very light on the cheese..the roll was olive oil and garlic but lacked a trace of either. They use Boars Head Meats. My wife had an eggplant parm sandwich her issue was the same just lacking any real flavor...bland...they had pasta dishes as well. as far as the market part...not much there...a few items but nothing I could not pick up at Whole Foods...if you are in that area it is a better choice than Rosati's which is next door but not a destination."}
{"text":"Best chicken salad sandwich I've ever had!  Emily makes it for me when I come in and I've never had a better sandwich!  I love this place!   If you haven't tried this deli your missing out!"}
{"text":"Well established mom and pop Italian joint hidden in the center of a strip mall. This is one of those places you can't just go in and say \"I want a salami sandwich\" without being asked what type (many varieties) of salami would you like? The thing I like most about this place, is that it's good everyday Italian food that doesn't make you feel stroke(ish) or bloated after eating...everything I've ever eaten from here was made from scratch and doesn't taste processed and is of high quality. I eat here every few weeks or so and every time I've eaten there, I've noticed the staff knows a lot of their customers by name, something you don't see much of anymore. The owners seem to take great pride in their restaurant and are quick to make recommendations. Tip: There is a little patio area next to the shop which is nice in the fall/winter months."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!! I cannot say enough kind things about this cute little deli! The owner is so fun and very accommodating! They loved my dog also and even brought him some water while we were waiting. The meatballs are a must have!! They are just delicious! My son likes the butternut squash ravioli but it is sweet almost more a desert than a savory meal! But onto the good stuff....the tiramisu is to die for! I have had tiramisu everywhere and anywhere I can get it and this is hands down the best tiramisu in the world! I love it and they give you a big slice!! Yummmm......as strongly as I feel about the tiramisu my sons feels about the limoncello cake! He can't get enough! These are must tries deserts!  You've got to check this place out! Oh! And they've got a super cute patio area to eat in!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be a regular at this place...I just know it!   Let me begin by taking you back to my foodie childhood...I was 12. I went to a cafe in my hometown that piled sandwiches with mortadella, provolone, sopressata, prosciutto, olive tapenade, and other fine ingredients - ingredients that would send this 12-year-old into a tizzy. I went here frequently, as to appease my early-developed palate. This place I speak of closed when I was 15. Never have I achieved the same sandwich nirvana....  ......until now, fourteen years later.   Could it be? Yes, it was! I had found the same sandwich nirvana!   My nirvana included the mortadella, prosciutto, salami, and asiago sandwich. First off, I ordered the full sandwich, not the half. Why? I was hungry (duh). Then I opened my takeout container. I wasn't that hungry. Needless to say, you get a lot of bang for your buck (approximately $9 for two hefty sandwich halves).  I also ordered the meatball sandwich with the deli's homemade meatballs. The sauce was well-balanced, the meatballs were tender, not tough, and it was topped on a crusty roll and high-quality cheese.  My next Carlo & Emilie's trip will include the cannoli....stay tuned."}
{"text":"Ok, so here it is.   I am giving this place 4 stars because the pork sausage sandwich was FLAT OUT LEGIT. I literally had to wash my beard after I ate it....? If my tongue was a little longer I would have kicked my own face it so good.....  And the coffee cake was solid!  I was thoroughly unimpressed with the soppressatta, salami and prosciutto sandwich. The bread was great, the greens were great, but the prosciutto had that almost spoiled flavor (maybe just sitting unwrapped too long?).... Not horrible but just not great.....  I still went 4 stars because everything else was great.  I will try that sandwich again in the future to be fair.  Regardless- you should definitely go to this place!"}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place. How did I not know? Amazing meatball sub. Delicious Italian sub - get the #2 (no mustard). The bread is homemade and the right amount of crusty and soft in the right places! Emilie was very nice. We had a wonderful experience with her explaining the menu. We got our order to go and she was so sweet to pack the meatballs separate from the bread so it wouldn't get mushy. Love this small business in Chandler and I plan to refer my friends and make it a regular eatery!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this deli. We've only ever gotten sandwiches from here. Excited to one day branch out, but whoa are the sandwiches good. The homemade bread is the way to go and of course, they give you homemade potato chips as well. I can pick almost any sandwich on the menu and be happy with it. Great quality, very fresh food. PS - I'm Italian and was raised with Italian breads, cold cuts and olives and this place is legit!"}
{"text":"The service is great here, and their meatballs are amazing! Food is really good, and boy, havent had a place like this in cali yet."}
{"text":"Love this place! There bread is phenomenal. Soups fresh and their portions are perfect. Every sandwich we've had has been spectacular."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with my husband. I got turkey and he got the roast beef sandwich. We also had a house salad. Everything was very fresh and delicious! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We are on a house hunting trip and moving to Arizona. We found this place quite by chance. They make their own bread daily, they make their own pork sausage, and they make their own fantastic Italian desserts. Service was great and staff very friendly. Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   Always fresh and super friendly. Authentic Italian dishes, incredible fresh baked bread. Great place to grab lunch and the patio is wonderful in the cooler weather."}
{"text":"Today I had pastrami on Carlo's same day, home made bread.  Outstanding sandwich, with great ingredients that are of better quality than any delicatessen, (or restaurant for that matter), in the area.   A friendly staff that makes good service a priority.    Very reasonably priced.   Don't miss out on this great value!"}
{"text":"Good food but a bit pricey for what you get.  Outdoor seating had no misters."}
{"text":"Stopped by to see what the hype was about and I think I'm in love now. I've never been to a real Italian deli and basically had no idea what anything was on the menu but a nice customer seated near the register have me all the info I needed and I settled for a cold sopressata and capicola asiago sandwich. The sandwich was huge and I had to save the other half for dinner. The meat was flavorful and I loved the baguette. I'll drive out 20 miles to come get a real sandwich and see Carlo, who is such a sweet man. Can't wait to go back this week, maybe I'll make myself a regular!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Casual yet incredible homemade food. Haven't been disappointed in anything I've tried and have been three times in the past couple weeks. Owners are always there and are delightful.  Spend your money locally and try this gem of place."}
{"text":"Nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood! Our group liked the tomato & Bolognese sauces, but found the Alfredo a bit rich. Pastrami sandwich very good. Bread is fantastic!! Not inclined to order to go as part of the appeal was the hot, fresh & tasty food."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! It will fulfill your taste buds...i strongly recommend it to everyone!! Had the pastrami and pasta salad!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Got 2 items\"to go\" French Dip and spaghetti. Not super fast, but this stuff is really scratch made so it's worth every moment.  Sauce is extremely flavorful, great pasta dish.  French dip been was cooked to perfection and so flavorful. Did I mention the bread?! So good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Totally overrated! Reading reviews on yelp, we were excited to try this place. We ordered takeout - caprese salad, roasted chicken salad, meat lasagna and tiramisu and all were huge disappointment. Caprese salad was sad looking with few pieces of tomato and mozzarella slices and barely visible basil for almost $8. For the portion of chicken salad they only give you tiny sauce cup of dressing. I had to use my own dressing to add more. Meat lasagna was soggy mushy mess. Only thing that was somewhat decent was tiramisu but wasn't as good. Will not be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"Such a great little hidden gem! Had the Marscapone Cheese and butternut Squash Ravioli! Amazing! It's like a tasty thanksgiving dessert ravioli. The light butter sauce paired w the cinnamon dusting was just enough to curb my need for dessert after a meal. (Sadly... I really wanted to try the tiramisu) we also had the cold sandwich #8. I loved that they used mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce. The sandwich was fresh and tasty and amply portioned ! Can't wait to make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been delicious!  So glad it's located close to my house. Love the butternut squash ravioli. Also love chatting with Carlo!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This little gem is a must try!  I had been wanting to go there for quite some time.  I visited one day as I was in the area and it did not disappoint!  Right away you could tell that there were many regulars whom know Carlo the owner and come in for a treat very often.  I came in for lunch and it was moderately busy but they took care of me right away explaining the menu and  offering suggestions.  The owner was floating around and came by to talk to me and find out how everything was.  I had the Chicken Pesto sandwich which was delicious!  If you like authentic Italian, this is your place!  A hidden gem in Chandler!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pastrami sandwich I've ever had even it is beyond Choppys I will go again and again great job Carlo and Emile"}
{"text":"This was my first visit. We arrived around 1:00 on a Tuesday. The gentleman (who I assume is the owner) was very friendly. He was smiling and humming to the music while he worked. The lady behind the counter gave us several suggestions based on our requests. We chose the mascarpone and butternut squash ravioli with butter and sage which was delicious! The owner asked a server to bring over a plate of green beans with tomato and garlic sauce (on the house)! She also brought over the plastic silverware as we forgot to grab ours. It was fresh and tasty. The dessert counter looked appealing so I ordered a carrot cake to take home to my husband. It was fantastic! I will come back based on fast and friendly service, flavor and location. There isn't a lot of indoor seating. My only small suggestion is that several tables hadn't yet been cleaned. I guess that's only a testament to how popular they were before we arrived."}
{"text":"Treated half of my team to this spot since they voted to eat sandwiches. They were very excited as was I to try to this Yelp gem.  We ordered two chicken Parmigiana sandwiches, one eggplant sandwich, one Kurt's chicken burger, one pastrami sandwich, three chocolate cannolis and two regular cannolis. They gave me two free regular cannolis since I ordered a veal parmigiana sandwich and they were out. Yep, so we had a total of 7 cannolis! Very nice of them. The staff was very friendly and was hard at work cooking. Cashier offered to put my food in a large box to make it easier for me to carry. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm always a bit skeptical when I see a restaurant with perfect reviews but this place is the real deal! We walked in and got 2 different Italian sandwiches- 1 - cappicola, salami, and provolone  and 1 - soppresato, salami, and provolone (forgive the misspellings) . The owner Carlo was there and recommended we have the sandwiches on his rustic bread (which may not be on the menu- ask for it!).  The sandwiches were the best Italian sandwiches my wife and I have ever had! The bread was just the right amount of hard/crunchy but not too tough.   We chatted with the owner a bit while we were eating and he offered us a free cannoli! It was my first and definitely won't be my last.  I will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Omg so good. First time here. I think I was served by the owner, nice as could be explaining all they had to offer.  I'm typing this with my thumb as I stuff my face with this delicious cheese and onion steak sandwich."}
{"text":"My new go to authentic mom and pop's style Italian.   Everything here is fantastic!  From the sandwiches,  pasta, salads, to the soups."}
{"text":"Love the subs and selection, it's great to have quality meats like their soppressata as a sandwich option. However, even gourmet sandwiches shouldn't take a half hour or more to be made and delivered. As if the wait isn't long enough, the staff is awkward and environment wasn't great."}
{"text":"The pasta here is to die for!! The watermelon gazpacho was on special and I couldn't put my spoon down. Just order everything."}
{"text":"The food was incredible! We had the #9 cold sandwich and the Hunter Style Chicken special. The entire staff including the owner Carlo were so friendly. We went there for lunch and loved it so much that we ordered take out for dinner tonight. I will be eating her frequently. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been awaiting a great eatery to replace the now defunct Chandler BBQ Company, and the wait was worth it.  I've had both the meat tortellini with bolognese and the marscapone with butternut squash ravioli, both made from scratch, both delightful.  I have huge expectations for their artichoke parmesan.  The restaurant does have a Facebook page when you can come and get a little extra info.  It's quaint and cute on the inside (seats 16) and they have a nice sized outdoor patio with ample seating, for al fresco dining.  The chef, Carlo, is friendly and excited for you to try his creations.  They have a chalkboard menu behind the counter, where you'll place your order, and a deli case with meats, cheeses and olives... soon to include desserts.  They offer hot and cold sandwiches, salads, pasta (with your choice of six sauces), and a few side dishes.  The beverage options include a fountain station.  Stop by for lunch or dinner.  Stay for the ambiance or get it to-go!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great quality. Real East Cost Italian. They don't use cheap ingredients. Carlo is first class and what great customer service. Home made bread, perfect and messy in a good way, Chicken Parm. Deserts were fantastic. Place is small and gets a lot of people at lunch time."}
{"text":"Ok gave it another try!!! 2 actually.  Me and the wife popped in. She had the bite it squash ravioli. Fantastic. Small portion but very good.  I had the lasagna. It was good tasting but cold in the middle. The sausage on the side was very good.  This time I ordered the Braciole. Based on Carlo himself a recommendation. Nicest guy! Speaks Italian which is nice.  The plant was $12.50 and came with the fresh homemade bread. The bread was cold for some reason.   The plate came out and Braciole is typically beef rolled into rolls stuffed with something or other. Not here.  It was a few slices of very dry beef and some slices of sausage. Not sure what the deal was with that but it was a very bland dish that needed much help in the form of Parmesan and Red pepper. I don't think he puts much seasoning into his sauces. It strikes me as though he is cooking for seniors with his flavor profiles. Ie: low sodium for high blood pressure folks maybe? No clue.  As I said, the guy is super nice, the rest of the people working here are kinda quiet.  I think we are done trying it for awhile with places like Pestos, La Stalla and even spaghetti factory so close."}
{"text":"Arrived about an hour before closing to try their sandwhiches. Decided to come after reading other Yelp reviews. Upon waking in, my eyes were immediately affixed to the dessert display. To the left of that sat the meat/cheese display, and then the register. Behind the register is a chalk board with the menu written on it. They have a wide variety of options including hot and cold sandwhiches, salad, soup, and pastas. I ordered the turkey and asiago sandwhich, and added pesto. My boyfriend got the chicken parmesan. The sizes were much larger than we expected. The half looks similar to a six inch, and a full is two of those. I was completely satisfied with a half. The sandwhich itself was delicious!! Hoagie bread was soft, turkey was moist, tomato was firm, and pesto had a hint of minced garlic...came with a side of pickle and pepperocini. We ordered the frangelico tiramisu for dessert and it was nothing short of divine, I'm just sad I didn't order the espresso to pair with it. Emilie was extremely generous towards us, and has a very warm and welcoming demeanor. She is one of the main reasons we will undoubtedly be returning! It doesn't hurt that the food is also absolutely delectable!  You won't regret stopping in here."}
{"text":"Tried this place out,, Was pretty darn good, that for sure.. I got the Beef Braciola.. Was pretty good other than a lil messy .. lol..  Will definitely be back soon !!   Hospitality is also very good. !! Rock on, keep up the great work !"}
{"text":"4 of us went for Friday lunch. It is a convenient area since we all work at Intel.  I am very big on 1st impressions. We were not greeted properly when we went to the front to order. She just stood there waiting for us to say something. Not even a smile. I ordered the eggplant parm sandwich and she said they ran out. It was 11:30 AM and they already ran out? Poor supply chain. She wasn't apologetic or anything. I ordered the prosciutto and asiago sandwich, my friends ordered meatball sandwiches, chicken parm sandwich, pasta salad, and lobster bisque. There is very little seating and really hot outside, with no misters by the way, so we decided to order to go. I was already annoyed by the Russian girl who took our order and when my friend wanted some more info on the cheesecake she said she had no idea about the cheesecake. This was going to be tough, I just knew it. He ordered the Italian cheesecake and that was the only thing that I enjoyed eating at this deli.  My prosciutto sandwich was boring and underwhelming. I had bite of the chicken parm and there was nothing special about it. The pasta salad was really sad looking, not a ton of veggies and it had too much dressing. Was not a fan.The soup of the day, lobster bisque, was not a bisque. At all. It was just a thin tomato soup with rubbery lobster. We waited a long time for the food in the small cramped place hovering over people while they had lunch. It was claustrophobic and I will probably never eat here again. It's worth the drive from here to Di Falco's. Just go there."}
{"text":"This place is great. Everything is fresh. I ordered the half sand which soup combo. Beef vegetable had big pieces of meat,no fat, very good. They have 3 different fresh homemade breads to put your sandwich. I will def be coming back!"}
{"text":"Super cool small deli in Chandler. The sandwiches are good (they make their own bread and sweet potato chips) but I enjoy the pasta dishes the most. The sausage are homemade and you can tell. The meatballs are super tender. The vodka sauce is awesome as well as the meat and marinara sauce. Prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"On a trip and ran across this...delicious! We had a cup of homemade butternut squash soup and split a pastrami sandwich. I was more than filling and had us talking about it!"}
{"text":"I went there the other day with friends and found some delicious goodies!  I had the half sandwich and soup. The tomato basil soup was outstanding.  My 1/2 sandwich was more like a whole sandwich and my friend's whole sandwich was actually two sandwiches! But my favorite part was the cannoli! It was hearty, but crispy with a lovely thick cream filling. Next time I try the squash ravioli everyone raves about!"}
{"text":"Everyone is friendly but this place is a little pricey!  The chocolate cAke is amazing , the sandwiches are huge and great taste."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday during lunch rush hour... Service was a bit slow due to the amount of customers, however, the wait was worth it! Great cold sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place, walked in 20 minutes before close and was refused service by extremely rude and abrasive staff stating that they were 'closed'. I understand coming in last minute- but 20 minutes? With the open sign still illuminated and everything? They need to treat their customer base more respectfully and learn how to pre-close in a way that they can still offer service! If you want to get out early at least lock the door and turn off the light so we don't have to deal with the nasty attitude. Very, very disappointed.   Update: owner contacted me defending his restaurant and countered this review with a positive one, which sounded more like a cheap advertisement and could easily have been substituted for an SNL skit. Wouldn't even hear me out or offer a solution, just wanted to make sure he didn't lose business. Not the type of business model I'd like to support."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is fantastic! I had a cold sandwich & soup combo (#8 sandwich with the French Onion soup). Blew my socks off! From the genuine customer connection, to the passion in the food- this place is definitely at the top of my list for referrals!"}
{"text":"This place is our new go to spot! The food is amazing and taste just like my Nonnas and Dads! It's the real deal Italian! You have to try it! Everything there is homemade even the bread for sandwiches! Amazing!"}
{"text":"When you hear on a whim. And I have the best pastrami sandwich ever. This sandwich was it reminded me so much of home. I glanced in a desert section but decided to wait till another visit. In the near future I will be revisiting it may be revising my review but so far it was very good. It was a cozy Lil place"}
{"text":"Great sub sandwich (#9) and pasta salad my first visit caused me to return the next day. My second visit i tried the meatball and eggplant parmigian sandwiches.  Neither were near as good as my first visit. Next time I'm in town I will definitely come back and suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"Real Italian food!  I had the eggplant Parmesan and my son had the meatball sandwich. Absolutely delicious! I recommend it highly.  The people are super nice. Super casual."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, and will be back many more. This is the real deal - a true \"deli\", not some chain operation with crappy bread, supermarket cold cuts sliced paper thin, slapped together by some kid with an attitude. No, this is what I remember as a kid - a \"real\" sandwich, with excellent, fresh ingredients, served in fair portions, and tasting 1000x better than the chain stuff. I particularly like the hard baguette bread option, and most recently I tried the penne pasta with Bolognese sauce and meatball, and it was absolutely SUPERB! Lots of other options on the menu to explore too. Can't wait try more stuff.  I have one suggestion for the owners - please lose the fountain-dispensed iced tea, and brew your own. Costs less and tastes far better. Other than that minor detail, you're hitting it out of the park."}
{"text":"Great place great food , only my second time visiting but enjoy everything about it. Got me some Cannolis a slice carrot cake and some bread. Great people, service equal great food."}
{"text":"This is an excellent deli specializing in Italian and French cuisine. I found both Carlo and Emelie to be very engaging, friendly and informative hosts.  My wife and I shared the pasta with bolognese sauce as well as the spaghetti with meatballs. We found them to be outstanding. Coincidentally I worked in Italy ( Brindisi), quite a while ago, not far from where Carlo was raised and I must say that Carlo's sauces are even better than I used to get in Italy!... Rob"}
{"text":"I had it for the first time today, and it was delicious i will definitely go back! Reminds me of Defalco's in Scottsdale. The staff was delightful, and it was very clean. Cant wait to try it all!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went in around noon on a Wednesday and were greeted by the Italian gentleman behind the deli counter who kindly explained the soup of the day and the daily special, a pork belly sandwich of some sort.  The menu board does not even begin to convey what my delicious sandwich entailed. I was having menu anxiety and asked the cashier what the most popular cold sandwich was, she told me #2 so I went for it (\"half\" sandwich for $6 and some change) and specified the baguette for my bread. I know it had cappicola and asagio cheese and another meat but did not realize it would also include red onions, marinated peppers, and vinegar and oil.   Per the menu board, my #2 was simple and unappealing, per the basket of deliciousness at my table, my sandwich was the best Italian sub I have found in Phoenix. The \"half\" sandwich alone was plenty to fill my lunchtime hunger.  I cannot wait to go back and try more of their sandwiches, pastas, the amazing looking antipasto salad, and various desserts perfectly displayed in a cooler in front of the deli counter."}
{"text":"\"Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formuoli!\"  It was a beautiful Friday morning when the Lunch Bunch assembled and got some delicious steamy food.  After browsing the menu, I decided on ordering the mascarpone cheese and butternut squashed filled ravioli in the browned butter sauce.    That first bite was a surprise!  I had ordered it thinking it would be a nice savory dish and instead, sweetness was the first thing I tasted.  The browned butter sauce had sage and sugar so it felt like I was eating little pillows with pumpkin pie-esque filling.  It's not exactly a bad thing but it was definitely unexpected.  I feel like I can say I had dessert for lunch.  The garlic bread included was super flavorful.  Bread is made fresh daily and they even sell loaves [and they sell out fast].  Everything was homemade and made with love.  At 11:30am, the quaint little place filled up fast and we sat in the outdoor patio to enjoy the nice, brisk, December air.  They have patio heaters set out so don't let it deter you away if you want to enjoy a nice dinner outdoors while staying toasty.  We also got to speak with the owners Carlo and Emilie and they're absolutely adorable and charming.  I wish them all the best in their new business!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian lunch spot. A full sandwich is enough for two people!! Super good."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian food for an extremely Good price this is it.  I had the meatball sub- best ever and my wife had the eggplant Parmesan, both tasted perfectly homemade which is hard to find in Italian food in Arizona- perfecto, Ciao!  Look at the reviews just go here it's excellent!!"}
{"text":"This place kicks butt! We tried the chicken salad and the turkey sandwich on a roll and both were out of this world! Plus a great value we split a half Sandwich and it was perfect size for lunch! The mustard vinaigrette was so amazing I could put that stuff on everything!! I want to try so much more there and I bet it's all good! Like I've said before can always use more cheese but I likes my cheese;) oh and Carlo is sooo sooo sooo nice... Great experience for my first try and it definitely won't be my last!"}
{"text":"Very nice Italian gem in Chandler, AZ on the southwest corner of W Germann Rd and S Alma School Rd. Instantly greeted by the friendly staff as we entered this deli/restaurant and felt very welcome here. Sizeable selection of sandwhiches (both hot and cold), pastas, salads, sauces, and mouth-watering desserts. We waited about 5mins for our food but there was not a line of people ordering when we arrived. Prices are appropriate for the quality of food and service.  Parking is shared with the Fry's grocery store parking and the other smaller stores in this strip. Plenty of spaces were available. This location makes for a nice before and/or after stop for visiting historic Downtown Chandler, hiking San Tan Mountain, viewing the valley and playing disc golf at Paseo Vista Park, walking/running/biking the nearby canal paths, or just out touring the area.  Currently, they do not have a liquor license, however, the great food and relaxing atmosphere more than makes up for it. If you are looking for some adult beverages you can enjoy a short 3 mile trip to Downtown Chandler after enjoying a delicious meal here.  Their shaded and dog friendly patio made for a nice area to sit and enjoy our meals (there was only one dog there and it was calm and quiet). The inside seating area is quaint and inviting as rustic decor completes the interior. Definitely coming back soon and telling others that Carlo & Emilie's Gourmet Deli is a great spot to satisfy your Italian tastebuds!"}
{"text":"First, the food is very good. The home made bread is outrageously good. The small seating area on patio outside is fine. Value...? Friend and I had 2 bowls of lentil soup, which was okay, not served with bread or even crackers. 2 full size sandwiches, a small Pellegrino and a fountain drink, $$$ 48 bucks!!!! Holy Moly. Could have had a sit-down with service most anywhere else. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Amazing little Italian deli! My bf is Italian and loved it! Said the pastrami was the best he's ever had. We met the owner, Carlo and he was great!"}
{"text":"Support local!!!! Saw the reviews,  love Italian Delis easy choice.   So I made my way there this week with my 11 year old.  We were quickly greeted by Carlo, and with even a few people before us asked \"Bella\" (his nickname for her) what she wanted.  Don't you worry he said after she said spaghetti alfredo, I will make it myself for you.   I ordered the chicken parm sandwich.   All I can say is WOW on both.   The bread on my sandwich was made fresh there and had the great crunch that you often don't get out here.  The chicken was breaded perfect yet was still not a gut bomb this sandwich when done poorly, Delish!  My daughter's Alfredo was creamy, cheesy and we'll she loved it.  I had a few fork fulls myself and I can see why her cell phone was not the center of her universe while she ate.  Carlo checked in with us a few times and as we were close to finishing told \"Bella\" he had a surprise.   A few minutes later over comes a canoli.  Yum.  So all I can say is if you like good old school Italian Deli items with a great owner this is your place, if you like Olive Garden and Slotzkys Deli well don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Ordered the sopressata and prosciutto sandwich on baguette.  Overall good, if not great, sandwich.  Only down side was the bread.  To be fair it was a very good bread but...the top was way too crispy/crunchy.  This in turn made it very hard to bite through without scratching up the top of my mouth.  There are other bread choices so I think I'll try one of them next time.  As far as price for what you get I found it to be very reasonable.  If you're familiar with DeFalcos you'll like this place.  Menu isn't as large but the quality is certainly equal."}
{"text":"Love this family owned deli! Amazing sandwiches and can't wait to try there pasta dishes:-) love that they use the finest ingredients unlike chain places. Definitely try this place you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"How could I be so blind and not notice that this restaurant is in Chandler!!!!! Not until my girlfriend told me about it, I would have driven by this place a million times and Never would have noticed it.   Shortly after our arrival, the owner came out of the kitchen to greet almost every single guest who came through the door. Everyone seems to like him and has known him for a while. I've also noticed that he was speaking Italian with the staffs. This is usually a good sign having REAL Italian (1st generation) making Italian food. As I was looking around, I saw sausages and meats that are possibly cured right then & there at the store. They even bake their own bread! They also sell spaghetti sauce and many other Italian seasonings. Just as I was envious of people in Scottsdale having their authentic Italian supermarkets/restaurants, now it is in my neck of my wood. I feel so proud and happy!!!!!!  For main entree, I ordered my favorite Italian dish - Meatballs/sausage and spaghetti with meat sauce. The meatballs are well seasoned/marinated. Sausages have just the right amount of spiciest to it. It also came two pieces of garlic bread and guess what? It was also homemade!!!!! I also took a bite of my friend's dishes and they were all equally delicious.   I embrace the friendliness of small businesses and how much the owner cares about the customers. Having been to so many chain restaurants, owners have lost touch with their customers and they simply left services on the hand of the servers. Not this restaurant!  I will definitely come back here over and over and over again."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, so glad we found it.  Great food, bread, desserts... chicken meatballs are fantastic!  Love the service and smiles, it's always great here."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and so glad we did. Cute little Italian deli with outside patio seating. Split a deli sandwich and Eggplant parmigiana with the hubby and both were excellent! Will definitely come back when we are in town next and make sure our local friends know about it!"}
