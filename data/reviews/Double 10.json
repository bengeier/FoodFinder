{"text":"I'm so glad that I just discovered such an adorable place in town!!! I like the decorations, they're so sweet!!! The most amazing part is that I can have some real Chinese food there.  I think Double 10 definitely gonna be my every day lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I am so excited that  I found this place!   I have been looking for decent Chinese food in Madison...yet another thing that doesn't really exist... and I found it with Double 10.  My only requirements for Chinese food: tastes decent the night of, tastes even better cold the next morning.   Double 10 has fulfilled both of those requirements and for that I am eternally grateful.    Last night I ordered some lo mein, sweet & sour chicken, and some spring rolls.   And, well, you can see from my picture of this food that I was more than happy with what was delivered.    They are speedy with their delivery and you can order online, which was convenient and very easy to do."}
{"text":"The location of this place is not easy to miss. It is right opposite whole foods, nice place for a quick stopover before/after grocery shopping. Or just whenever I feel like having some authentic northeastern chinese cuisine. From the outside, however, it looked small (well, it is small), so I almost didn't want to give it a try, thinking that it is just another american-chinese fast food place. But was I wrong!   My first visit was on a rainy day, when we didn't feel like traveling far, and hence stopped in Double 10. My review is based on their local chinese menu/specials, b/c I haven't tried any of the american-chinese type food. I tried their kung pau chicken, shredded potatoes, fried noodles and rice, fish sauce egg plant, moo shu pork and the four season green beans. The dishes are very authentic. My boyfriend, who grew up in northeastern china, endorses their food too.   As this is a largely family-run restaurant, and because the dishes are made to order, they are very good at customizing your dishes the way you want it. You can customize the level of spiciness, saltines, substitute rice for noodles etc. This is also the time to be creative. If there is a dish you want that is not on the menu, feel free to tell them about it, and they will make it for you.   The bonus is that they carry fresh home made chinese dumplings with a variety of fillings, including a vegetarian option. Those dumplings are kind of pricey compared to the other items on the menu, but they are home made, so I would say that is a great trade off. But it depends on how much you are willing to fork out for your meal.   This is a great place and a great addition to Madison, where traditional northeastern chinese food does not easily come by. For the adventurous people out there who are curious about northeastern chinese food, there is no better place to start than double 10, who are great at listening to what you want and then making it for you. One small note, seating is very limited, only about 5 tables, so ordering ahead and getting it to go is the safest bet, or you can get them to deliver straight to your door."}
{"text":"Offering both traditional and Americanized menus the food is always fresh and delicious. If you like it spicy order off the traditional menu (Kung Pao chicken and Ma Po Tofu are superb).  Beef with Broccoli and chicken with snow peas are excellent as well. The restaurant is small so not much space for a large group but terse is always take out. I have eaten here several times and it has always been very good ."}
{"text":"Not bad for traditional Chinese in madison, but nothing too special either. The Kung pao chicken (traditional) is the closest I've had to real Sichuan Kung pao. Decent spice level and a good blend of ingredients: peanuts, celery, peppers, and spicy chicken.   The traditional dumplings;  however, are a total waste. Thick skin (which is fine if they have enough filling) had sparse fillings and were very bland.   I'd stick to traditional Chinese menu and stay away from the dumplings."}
{"text":"I literally had the worst Singapore mei fun in Madison. Except for EXTREMELY HOT, it was tasteless. I do like hot food. But this dish is simply great amount of hot sauce mixed with mei fun and a little meat. I wonder if the cook ever know what is Singapore mei fun, or he/she ever try his/her own Singapore mei fun."}
{"text":"The husband and I were foraging for nourishment as we do not celebrate Christmas, and we stumbled across Double 10. Very polite staff, clean interior - including kitchen area, and they even serve you if you dine in. We both ordered Lo Mein, one with chicken and the other with shrimp. All of it was simply delectable and we now call it our \"favorite Chinese place\". Double 10 will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL OF FRAUD AT http://www.double10delivery.com/ AND www.double10restaurant.com!!!!!! These two websites look identical and the phone numbers are the correct numbers for the actual restaurant, but are complete fraudulent sites. The orders get sent into who knows where and the food that comes is complete BS rip-off hands down THE worst Chinese food I have ever eaten.  Okay the story goes... I had pretty good experience going to double 10 so i decided to order delivery from their website. I checked to see if the address and phone number on the website was accurate so I submitted an order for 4 dishes with my friends. The food did come, except only 2 items out of the 4 showed up. The \"handmade dumplings\" were some sort of frozen dumplings that tasted like shit. \"beef rolll\" was just a scallion pancake, and my other traditional Chinese dishes did not come at all. I called the number on the website in which I ordered from to complain. The owner (of the real double 10) informed me that I did not submit an order with them. There were no deliveries out to my place at all. She asked if I wanted to place another order, but at that point I was so pissed that I wasted 40 bucks on like 5 frozen dumplings and scallion pancakes. The owner said double10delivery.com is not their website, so she doesn't know who provided me with my order. BUT HOW CAN YOU BE AWARE THAT A THING LIKE THIS EXISTS AND NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT????? I didn't even know if my food was edible because I have no idea where it came from. For all I know it could've came from the dumpster somewhere so I ended up throwing the whole thing away.  OTHERWISE the restaurant is good, I love visiting their store. However, I think this situation like this should not exist."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go-to for Chinese food - food is not bad, it's convenient, and best of all, it delivers.   Sadly, their online ordering system is not reliable. After waiting for more than an hour, I called them and realized they never received my order despite the email confirmation. I believe there is a new employee at this restaurant and she is just terrible - she did not apologize for the mistake at all, and even requested me to wait another 40 minutes. No refunds at all, no apologies, all she asked for is my credit card number again.   This experience definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Please bring back the old staff - the lady who used to be at the front desk was very nice, courteous, and efficient, and I have made multiple online orders without any mishaps. Get rid of incompetent staff or else the business will suffer!"}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed. I ordered sesame chicken and fried rice. A classic meal that should be pretty straight forward for any chinese restaurant, but no. The chicken tasted nothing like sesame chicken and it looked more like sweet and sour chicken with sesame seeds thrown on top. The \"fried rice\" was more like regular rice with a bit of soy sauce and scant appearances of egg. Seriously disappointing. I have no idea how this place got such high reviews."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Clean and food is fresh. Taste good. The sour napa and the southeast bone are pretty good. Real Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Here is a such bright & fashionable place! I like the style they have,it makes me feel warm n comfortable! So glad to know they grand opening! Almost forget to tell, they have wonderful food also!!! Especially dumplings!  Definitely Come back!"}
{"text":"Would recommend it. A north China flavor and very good service. Better check the Chinese menu if you wanna try something really Chinese."}
{"text":"Braised spare ribs were bland, and the sauce was wrong. Mediocre beef pancake rolls. The American Chinese food looks like a good deal. Maybe the Sichuan dishes are more tasty and authentic."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been living in Madison for over a year, and had been trying to find a place with decent but inexpensive chinese food. Fugu was ok, but overpriced and their delivery is slow. Ichiban seemed just ok. I've tried others with no luck. Finally I tried double 10, and I'm soooooo happy! It's really good, but also way cheaper than anything else I've found in town. I really liked the garlic sauce they have. They also had super fast service. This is my new go to Chinese place!"}
{"text":"When i went to double 10 It was full so we took to go.The food came out quickly.When we tasted the food I liked it. I liked the rice,also the sweet chicken was not to sweet but it was just right...I recommend double 10......"}
{"text":"I had read some reviews on Yelp and decided to try the fairly new Double 10 Chinese take-out restaurant.  I ordered an assortment off the traditional Chinese menu for the three people in my family.  I ordered the chicken mushroom dumplings ($5.99), the pork with dry bean curd ($8.95), the sesame chicken combo meal ($7.29), and the North East Flavor Pork Bone ($10.95).  The cashier said it would take 15 minutes and I was happy she was correct with the time since we were hungry!   The sesame chicken and chicken dumplings were standard, just average but tasty.  What we really liked was the pork with dry bean curd.  The vegetables, onions and green peppers, were julienne cut.  There was plenty of bean curd but not much pork.  The spicy sauce was wonderful and we all loved it. It went well with the white rice.   The big disappointment was the most expensive entrée, the pork bone.  It consisted of soup bones with very little pork.  There were no vegetables and we ended up paying quite a bit for something that was 90% bone.  There were very few seasonings so the meat was very plain.    Our order was $35 and it only included 3 soy sauce packets and 2 fortune cookies.  That's for three people and I feel they could have been more generous there.  But we will be back for the Pork with Dry Bean Curd because it was very good."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch to serve 20 people for my graduation talk on Dec 2013. They delivered on time. And the food are great. Most of my talk attendee told me they like the food and ask me to share the address."}
{"text":"I was wondering what to eat yesterday and when I yelped around, I saw this attractive style place. Double 10, nice name, as a Chinese, I know what that means, it means perfect, and in here, I think \"perfect?is exactly for the food, oh yeah, and also the environment. I tried almost all the top 5 dishes here, and I can say they are amazing, from service to drink and food, that's kind of feeling that I went home and my mom cooked me those!"}
{"text":"I met my buddy at Double 10 for lunch.  I first thought the prices were very high ($10.99 for my terrible sweet and sour pork).  My buddy got very spicy chicken.  We both got a bowl of white rice, and we had to buy our own drinks.  I went to pay for us with my American Express card, and the little Chinese woman said they don't take it because it cost them 6%, which I know is a lie.   The sweet and sour arrived - No pineapple, just a few strips of vegetables, The pork was a thin strip, like bacon, heavily breaded and deep fried.  Tasted terrible.  The restaurant only had plastic silverware, and I had to ask the little Chinese woman for real silverware - Which was dirty - Not well washed and shiny. I couldn't finish my lunch, and my buddy only had a couple of pieces of the pork - He didn't like it either. I will never go back to that place - Sterile atmosphere, high prices horrible food, lying staff, do not take AMEX.  The whole place was dirty and cheap.  The whole meal cost $25.30 for the two of us - Could have purchased a much finer meal at Hong Kong Cafe for about $12 - $14 for the two of us.   I cannot recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"The mushroom chicken is so good! The mushrooms were not over done. Everything was delicious! The only reason I didn't give them 5 is I got carry out and they served others who ordered after me. But it was a small wait for such tasty food!"}
{"text":"Love this place, so friendly and speedy service. When I need good Chinese food, great portions and a great price this is where I come (usually once a month). I love the garlic chicken, the orange chicken is great too. I always upgrade to the chow mein (or low mein...I can't remember) definitely worth the extra few dollars!!"}
{"text":"Tried most of the dishes in the traditional Chinese menu, they are pretty good. Try Three Brothers, Mu Shu Pork, very tasty."}
{"text":"Fourth time here and the food is so delicious. Tonight I'm having the Garlic Chicken which is virtually perfect. My son is having the Traditional Kung Pao Chicken which is too spicy for me but the flavor is wonderful."}
{"text":"One of the best and authentic Chinese restaurants in town! I am a frequent customer. Food is good, prices are reasonable, and ordering is so fast! Everything I tried has been great!"}
{"text":"Love homestyle tomato& egg! My favorite dish growing up and I was so happy I found it here. Also the braised pork belly is so good."}
{"text":"So happy to finally try Double 10, after reading the rave reviews on Yelp. I had been curious about this place, since it is so close to where I live. And one of my quests since coming to Madison over 10 years ago was to find an Asian food place I really liked. Double 10 fits the bill on both counts.  I got the Moo Shu Pork and the Kung Pao chicken, both off the  traditional menu. I've never had Moo Shu in such a delicate sauce with ginger before, it was delicious.  The cashier was kind enough to warn me in advance that the Kung pao was going to be fiery and it was, in a very good way. Plenty of vegetables in both. I left off a star in my rating above, as I will be coming back to try other things off the menu. I hope to see how the Chinese-American menu measures up, but for now, I've sticking with the traditional. Really glad they came into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Madison.  Authentic menu is awesome... Service is awesome and super nice.  Small dining area is comfortable and homey. Love this place.  Eggplant w/garlic is amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic quick Chinese food.   Vegetables in Kung Pow Chicken were still crisp and fresh tasting, not the typical soggy fare in fast take out.  Szechuan Tofu was even better, nice chunks of firm tofu slightly crispy on outside, broccoli, peppers, water cress and a sauce with just a hint of heat.  Kids loved the fried rice and chicken lo mein.  Nothing was greasy or soggy and all had great flavor.  Can't wait to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good cashew chicken. Not too much sauce which is good. Average egg roll s and crab Rangoon."}
{"text":"Although you can eat in the restaurant at one of Double 10's four tables, The Wife and I have been using it as a good option for carryout Chinese food in the West Madison/Middleton area. The online ordering system is easy, but I find that calling is the easiest way to place an order.  On the positive side, Double 10 serves really good dumplings (and dumpling sauce), has fair prices, and is convenient for pickup purposes (right along University between downtown and Middleton).  On the neutral plane, Double 10's food is A-OK. Like previously mentioned, the dumplings are very good, but everything else has been just OK. The notable exception has been the egg drop soup, which is very bland and much more watery than we've had elsewhere.  On the negative side, Double 10 is somewhat disorganized and has been overwhelmed every time I've gone in to pick up food. There seems to be only one guy working the counter, taking phone and online orders, and helping people get their pick-ups when they come into the store. The last time I was in, I arrived at the given time only to be told that our food wasn't ready yet because they were \"very busy.\" (On a side note, I've never been asked to give a name or credit card when placing a phone order. I'm still surprised that they work on the honor system like that)."}
{"text":"Ordered two lunch specials to go (Mongolian beef, general tso chicken). Both were very delicious, surprisingly.  They use a semi-fried rice (with egg) instead of plain white rice, very yummy. I will definitely have to come back and try the authentic Chinese menu."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout twice and dined in once. Dining in was awkward because of the small space and with every table full, there weren't enough water pitchers to go around. We had to wait until other diners finished their meal and put the water pitcher back into the cooler. The food was very good and portions were good for a leftover lunch. We ordered the cumin chicken and sour napa with pork. The dishes inspired me to look up similar recipes online to make at home. I felt that the dinner prices were on the expensive side, but there is a good selection of traditional foods.   Both takeouts have been hot and ready by pick-up time. The most recent order was from the lunch special menu. The fried rice that was included in the meal didn't look like fried rice-just white rice tossed with soy sauce and miniscule pieces of egg. I'm glad I ordered another meal with white rice. The chicken lo mein was ok. The star was the shrimp in garlic sauce. You could definitely taste the ginger in the sauce. The quantity of shrimp in the meal was more than enough for both of us to share without fighting over who gets the last shrimp. We liked that each dish didn't have the same sauce base and they tasted fresher than other takeout Chinese food in the area.  They'll be closed beginning 3/27 due to renovations in the plaza. No updates of where or if they'll relocate."}
{"text":"Great Chinese from a small place.  Offers traditional and Americanized Chinese food.  We had the wonton soup with great tasting home made dumplings (small size is pretty big for one).  The teriyaki chicken appetizer that our young son wolfed down (authentic Japanese flavor karaage style and 6 pieces).  The chicken with mixed vegetables in a mild brown sauce (big portion, fresh vegetables,  cooked just the right amount of time).  The Szechuan Triple with a medium spicy sauce, many different vegetables,  chicken,  pork, and several large shrimp.  White rice comes with the entrees and my Japanese wife thought it was much better than at an average Chinese restaurant where it is often dry and tasteless.  Everything tasted way above average.   Total bill was only about $26.50 including tax.  The restaurant only has 5 small tables so many were coming in for takeout.  Come in for some really good Chinese food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Just had a yummy lunch in this sweet spot. There are a lot of menu choices, both American and traditional Chinese. I had the curry chicken with onions. It has some spicy kick to it, a surprising amount of other veggies mixed in, and I loved it. I wanted to devour the entire plate since I just finished an indoor cycling class, but I managed to save about 1/3 of it for later. This is definitely an item I will have sudden cravings for in the future.  The place is cute and cozy. Clearly used to be a coffee shop since the wallpaper at the counter and electrical outlet covers still have a kitschy coffee theme, but it was still nice and clean. The people at the counter were really friendly, too!  Next time I will try the handmade dumplings."}
{"text":"First time here I ordered orange chicken, beef lo mein & crab rangoon. Placed a take out order online & it was ready with in 10 mins. Everything was very tasty! Best Chinese I've had in Madison. Everything was flavorful and cooked very well. Requested vegetables with the orange chicken, received large amount of crunchy broccoli. Very pleased with everything. Reasonable prices & fast service. Some reviews stated they were cash only, but they now accept cards. Will return here soon!"}
{"text":"As I never order from its American-Chinese food menu, this review is limited to the authentic menu written on a piece of paper in the restaurant. Same menu is shown on the website as \"traditional Chinese food.\"  Double 10 is a long-awaited addition to the increasingly diverse Chinese food scene in Madison. Most \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant serve Szechuan/Sichuan food (spicy)--places like Fugu, Soga, and Ichiban; while some serves Cantonese/Guangdong cuisine--like Wahkee or Lee's Garden on the west side. These restaurant are all good, verified (by myself) as \"authentic\", but in a way, lack of menu diversity.  And then, Double 10 brings something entirely different to Madison--cuisine hauled from northeastern China. In two visits, we had \"slide pork\", \"pork with sour napa\", \"pork with dry bean curd\" etc. They were items not found in any other Chinese restaurant in Madison, and of course, all very delicious.    When we visited, almost every table ordered \"North East Flavour Pork Bone\" and that is something we aim for in our next visit.   The staff was friendly. The dining area is a bit small, but good enough for small group gathering. The price is very reasonable, too. I hope they stay in business for long."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in town!  In addition to their normal menu, they offer a very extensive list of authentic Chinese dishes, which are both delicious and high quality.  I think their chef is doing a great job, and I hope that they continue with their level of service and quality into the future.  If you have never tried more authentic Chinese cooking, do yourself a favor and reach out of your comfort zone a bit!  You will not be disappointed.  Many of the traditional dishes are spicier than some of my friends can handle, so if you're like them, don't be afraid to order the dish and ask them to tone down the heat a little.  Here's my history:  I tried the spicy eggplant, which was extremely fragrant and tasty, not to mention, beautiful.  The plate literally glowed purple, that's how fresh the eggplant was.  My friend ordered the Cumin Beef, which was also amazing.    11-8-13:  Ate there today and tried the black pepper chicken and the pork dumplings (both from the Chinese version menu), and both were amazing!  The pepper chicken reminded me of deep fried chicken with dry chili pepper that you'll find at some of the other more authentic Chinese restaurants in town.  And the dumplings were hand made!!  12-18-13: Ate there again today with others and we tried the cumin chicken.  AMAZING.  We also had the pork dumplings, which are just as good as the first time I had them.  They are a bit smaller now, but there are more of them, which I actually prefer.  At $6.00 for a plate full, it's a complete steal.  We also tried traditional (Chinese style) sweet/sour pork.  It was pretty good, but maybe a bit sweet for our tastes.   12-20-13: The black pepper chicken changed, it was mostly fried bread this time, a bit disappointing.  Hopefully it was just a bad batch this time.  But their spicy green beans delivered.  AMAZING, they do it better than anyone else in town, IMO.  Definitely one of my favorite dishes there.  I'm really loving the traditional Chinese menu here, and it keeps growing!  Check out my pics..."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant when it was Szechuan but then the food started getting bad and we stopped ordering. Then the restaurant became Double 10 and we decided to try it again and ordered the same thing - mongolian beef, chicken with broccoli and crab rangoons. To our surprise it was great! The crab rangoons were wrapped differently in thinner won ton wrappers and tasted delicious! And all the food was perfectly prepared.  Then we ordered again last night and it was horrible! Probably the worst Chinese food ever. The mongolian beef was chewy and resembled fat. The boneless spare ribs were lined in actual fat. And the chicken fried rice was tasteless. The chicken with broccoli was good but probably because it was mostly vegetables and no chicken. The crab rangoons were back to normal and tasted fine but not as good as the first time when we tried Double 10.  We were so disappointed and not going to risk spending $25 dollars again on bad food that we would rather throw away instead of saving for leftovers.  Maybe they have two chefs? We are not willing to keep ordering to find out."}
{"text":"The food was really just OK in my book. The Mapo Tofu is spicy(thankfully) but the Egg Drop Soup was surprisingly quite bland and tasteless(no salt). As others wrote - the inside decor is really nice. The service was very polite and professional. I feel like some of the other reviews are fakes(1 review, 5 stars and just for this place)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, they never brought it. Hunger levels very high right now. Mad."}
{"text":"Rivals Tom's Red Pepper as the best Chinese restaurant in Madison.  The traditional menu is real Beijing comfort food."}
{"text":"The cumin lamb is delicious! My brother who was visiting from California joked that he would come back to Madison just for that dish, and he may not have been joking... :) Very informal place otherwise but worth a stop!"}
{"text":"We have gluten sensitivity in our family and they made fried rice without soy sauce for us. Very accommodating and friendly about it."}
{"text":"I had been craving Chinese food for a few weeks, and we decided to look to Yelp for  someplace new to try.  I'm very glad we were near Double 10 when we searched!  I had the cumin lamb from the traditional menu.  I'd never had a cumin-centric Chinese dish, and I think this was my first one with lamb, too.  I loved it!  Nice and spicy, with a generous quantity of tender lamb.  It was enough food that I took some home and had another small meal with my leftovers.  The guy at the counter said the cumin lamb was his favorite dish there - I hope he's working on my next visit because I'd like to see what his other recommendations are.  But there's a good chance I'll get cumin lamb again!  My wife had the curry chicken with onion, and it was also very good, and on my short list of foods I want to have again soon.  Double 10 is mainly a takeout place, but they have a nicer seating area than most.  We dined in and it was very pleasant.  It was a late lunch on a Saturday, and business was steady with mostly takeout but a few others eating in.  Beverages are a variety in cans or bottles from the cooler.    We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Read the Yelp reviews and decided to check this place out for a yummy Sunday supper with my husband. I am an absolute fan of traditional Chinese food so I got the pork and cabbage hotpot. It's amazing! I absolutely loved it. Husband got the more American-style fare of Sesame Chicken. Portions were huge and delicious. We will absolutely be back again!"}
{"text":"No. I don't care for this at all. We ordered delivery. Even crappy chinese usually has enough msg to make it tasty. This was bland and dry! We ordered curry chicken combination and general Tsao's chicken.  They were both not spicy enough and DRY. Let it swim in the sauce please! The veggies in the dish were few and far between. The egg rolls were not crispy. Bland. Boring. I will try somewhere else next time. The star is only for delivering to the correct location."}
{"text":"As an Asian-American, I am actually happy that there are two menus, one for Asians and one for not Asians. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for a really authentic sauteed beef and mixed vegetables with white rice. Other times I just want some sweet-n-savory General Tso's Chicken and greasy pork fried rice with it. This place satisfies both. The first time I went there, I ordered lightly stir fried fish filet with julienne carrots and onions and white rice from the Asian menu. Perfectly tender, great portions, not oily, what I'd expect my grandpa would make back in China. The second time, I ordered delivery and got kung pao chicken and fried rice from the American menu. I also got a free egg roll thrown in. The kung pao chicken was very spicy and bold, a bit oily and very tender. Totally hit the spot.   Overall, you'll get the classic \"Chinese restaurant in America\" treatment here - minimal decor, affordable prices, speed over politeness, and good filling food. This is how Double 10 sells itself, and you shouldn't treat them any differently."}
{"text":"Traditional menu is the way to go. My spouse swears by the green beans with pork. I'm vegetarian so fewer options, but \"3 brothers\" is good and there is a whole section of fake meat dishes (e.g. kung pao chicken with fake chicken)."}
{"text":"Another favorite to add to my list of good Chinese restaurants in Madison. Double 10 has a very small dining area, so plan on getting takeout. There seems to be two menus here: the Americanized Chinese dishes and the more traditional Chinese dishes. I would definitely go for the traditional menu. Any of their eggplant dishes are good, and you can't go wrong with one of their spicy dishes. I don't know what the spicy dish I ordered was, but it had a ton of chilis and peanuts in it. The owners were very friendly, and I heard you can make special requests and they'll try to accomodate you. I'm definitely adding Double 10 to my takeout rotation!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. If you come here do yourself a favor and get something from their traditional Chinese menu. Great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken soup noodle in here.  The chicken is not so juicy, a little dry. After having two I cannot continue.  The soup in the noodle is good. But not as good as it described as \"the noodle is cooked with chicken soup in good quality\".  The noodle is good. But when the above are put together, I cannot say that's a good noodle meal among all the noddles I have ever had.  The restaurant interior looks like most of the Chinese food restaurant, looks like majorly serve for Americans and the food is Americanized. The restaurant is very clean, I like the environment."}
{"text":"This is our new go-to for Chinese food.  I just tried the curry chicken with onions, (potentially my new favorite), and my wife got the bean curd homestyle, which she says is always spot on.  Other great dishes include the mu shu vegetables, hot and spicy chicken and szechuan chicken.  In the last few months, we've only experienced one flub work am order, but it was swiftly corrected upon calling.    I can't endorse this place enough."}
{"text":"This place has some authentic northern Chinese dishes and the dumplings tastes great. The location is very convenient."}
{"text":"The food was good, and the portions were generous, but the decoration was lacking; it has a strong teen-girl-in-Ikea vibe. Still, if a restaurant's only fault is the decor, you know it's good."}
{"text":"The orange chicken was mostly dark meat and very tough and not spicy. The lo neon was very salty. The soups were average and the price reasonable. You get what you pay for. Not the best."}
{"text":"Hot Garlic Eggplant- not super spicy, but, oh sooo delicious! If you've haven't tried sweet'n'sour eggplant, eggplant w/ fish sauce, or really any eggplant dish from an authentic Chinese restaurant, do yourself a favor and try it!  Pork with Dried Bean Curd- this had plenty of spice, and was very good.  Both dishes came w/ small rices. Delivery was quick (30min). Food was hot, ample, and the closest thing to the best Szechuan Chinese food I've had at Seattle's Sichuanese Cuisine (recommended by a friend from Szechuan province), and St. Paul's Little Szechuan.  Please order off the \"Traditional\" menu, as Madison has far too many average American Chinese restaurants (I'm looking at you Imperial Garden), and could use a little \"authentic\" competition."}
{"text":"Madison has way too many mediocre-at-best Chinese takeout & delivery places. Double 10 is a little takeout joint (with like 4 tables if you want to eat in) that actually tries to put out good food.   I've mostly gotten stuff from the traditional Chinese food menu and it's been reliably tasty. Nice dumplings made from scratch. Hot garlic pork is HOT. And tasty. But be careful. One time I accidentally knocked the container of left over hot garlic pork off the kitchen counter and on to the floor and I was NOT happy. Because it's good."}
{"text":"We decided on Chinese delivery last night and have been dissatisfied with the couple of places we regular bounce between so we opted for something new and went with Double 10.  We were pleased (though perhaps a little daunted) by the scale of the menu and wide variety of choices available. Ultimately we went with curry chicken and onion and chicken lo mein as well as a couple of pork egg rolls.  The egg rolls were crispy without being overly greasy, the balance between the meat and vegetables were good and on the whole they were one of the better egg rolls I've had.  The chicken lo mein was simply seasoned but delicious. The noodles were tender, no singed / burnt / hard noodles like you might encounter at other restaurants, and the flavor was savory but not overpowering.   Much to my wife's dismay the curry chicken was spicy for her. I'd call it on the high end of mild / low end of medium but she's what you might call a \"spice wimp\" -- so other spice wimps be warned! You may wish to call your order in and ask to make sure your dish won't be too hot for you. It worked out well enough for me as the lo mein order was ample enough for two people to eat their fill and I wound up with lunch for a couple of days from the curried chicken.  There was a good blend of vegetables and chicken in the curry, the spice was pleasantly warm without being overwhelming (to me), but the curry flavor was more muted than I prefer. That's the only negative I can find with it.  I look forward to trying additional dishes from these guys! Perhaps I'll even really get adventurous and use the traditional Chinese menu next time."}

{"text":"Definitely overrated. They screwed up our order. Overall their food is bland and disappointing.   The only positive is that their service was fast despite how understaffed they are."}
{"text":"We tried Double 10 for the first time last week and it was very much as advertised. I placed a take out order on-line and then went into the shop to pick it up. Everything was bagged up and ready to go on time when I arrived and all in all the transaction was very easy. The restaurant itself is on the small side and i imagine most of their business is take out or delivery. That being said, by the time we sat down to eat our delicious Chinese food was a bit cold and it probably would have tasted even better had it been hot and fresh. Here's what we enjoyed:  Hot and Sour Soup - Really tasty! Rich, flavorful soup with crunchy veggies and nice meat and tofu. Silky sort of mouth feel and overall VERY good. Nice to have the crunch of fried wontons to put on top, but they weren't really needed.   General Tso Chicken - This was actually included for free since we had a big order. Large crunchy pieces of chicken with a sweet and slightly spicy sauce. Probably not the best General chicken ever, but very enjoyable.   Mongolian Beef - Very good texture to the beef and tons of delicious onions. The sauce was really tasty as well, and again this would have been EVEN BETTER if it was nice and hot. Will definitely be ordering this again, it's a favorite recipe executed very nicely.   Shrimp Lo Mein - Good, but not my favorite. Nice texture to the noodles for sure, which is really important. The shrimp were a little small and could have been a bit more flavorful, but they were cooked nicely.   Hot Black Pepper Chicken - This was the winner of the night! Hugely flavorful with great crunchy texture and an amazing aroma. As good as the chicken itself was the mushrooms that soak up all the flavorful sauce were far and away the very best thing we had. If anything was going to be fought over it was this dish (and the gorgeous mushrooms in particular).   Broccoli w. Garlic Sauce - Garlic sauce is really good, and while this was really purchased for a vegetarian guest I could see getting it again. If you are vegetarian I'd say this is highly recommended.  Sauteed Braided String Beans - This was also ordered for our vegetarian guest, but IT IS NOT A VEGETARIAN DISH! That being said, it was DELICIOUS! Loved this and will certainly be ordering it again in the future. Fresh, crisp green beans with a nice garlic and pork sauce; an absolute winner!   Double 10 will likely become our new take out top choice for Chinese food. I'm very tempted to go try it as a sit down, but I'm worried finding seating could be a gamble. We're just a bit outside their deliver area, which is a bummer, but it's not really a terrible drive to get there and back. Highly worth a shot, especially if you're close and can enjoy the food as its served rather than as it comes out of a take out container..."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from Double 10 and it's been reliable.  I have not really explored the second menu which is more authentic chinese.  I found myself without dinner plans and a car not really working so I walked to Double 10 for a dinner.  The interior is not fancy but comfortable.  There are several tables for diners with both chairs and benches.  Ordering is at the counter.  Sodas in the cooler on the side.  Counter staff was friendly.  I ordered the Slide Pork.  I have never heard of that before.  It was a breaded pork in a flavorful sauce served with carrots, green peppers, and garlic with white rice.  I enjoyed it very much but after I was half done I was looking for a different taste.  I would like it more if there were two or four dinner guests with me to share other dishes too.  As I was eating, there were many take out customers and one other customer chose to eat in.  His meal looked good, too.  I look forward to exploring their menu more especially the Authentic Chinese menu."}
{"text":"Lets just say I've found the Chinese food holy grail. It's taken months, if not years, to find someplace that slices the beef just right, doesn't go overboard with the oil, makes flavorful fried rice with real roasted pork pieces. I'm overjoyed to have stumbled upon this gem. It's very small, but clean, friendly and extremely affordable. Mind you, I live in Chicago but will most definitely stop here anytime I pass through Madison!"}
{"text":"Went back to Wisconsin to visit a friend and they took me to this restaurant as they say it was one of the best. People are very nice and everythings really good, if you are in LA, then it would probably just be one of the many good Chinese restaurants, but in Wisconsin, i would definitely say go try it ! Really is THE BEST you can find in the area!"}
{"text":"I have been on a quest to find good Chinese food places in Madison. Sometimes, I need more than the usual take out Chinese. Double 10 seems very authentic.  We ordered the hot and sour soup to start. I really enjoyed this soup. It had an abundance of vegetables and wasn't overly spicy. I can appreciate when lots of ingredients are used in a soup.  For entrees, we got the Chinese eggplant in garlic sauce and mapo tofu. Chinese eggplant is thinner and smaller than the usual eggplant. It still has the same texture but is definitely more flavorful. The garlic sauce was super tasty. The mapo tofu was a little too spicy for my personal liking, but it's definitely very authentic - a classic Szechuan dish.  There is limited seating here, but they have a counter at which to order, so take out is an option. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to have found a decent Chinese place with all the reviews I read, but truthfully we found it mediocre. I ordered the chicken chow mien and have never had it the way the make it. It was chicken and some really slimy cabbage type stuff over rice with some crispy noodles. There were no other vegetables in it. We got one egg roll and one spring roll, neither which were stellar. Reading over the reviews I am now assuming the 5 stars were for food off the authentic menu, rather than just the regular menu. Won't go out of my way to go back, too many mediocre places closer to my house. I wish I could find a good one!"}
