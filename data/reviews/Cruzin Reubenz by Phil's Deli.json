{"text":"Prompted by the great reviews my wife and I went for lunch. Service was prompt and friendly. We tried the corned beef and pastrami sandwiches on rye.  They were okay but nothing to rave about - especially the pastrami which was not as tasty as we expected. We are both from NYC and believe we know what good pastrami should taste like. Won't be back. Above review was erroneously posted and not meant for this deli. Went there today for the first time. Food was very good. Service prompt, friendly and attentive. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This is my new go to deli! So clean and such friendly service. I learned it's a family owned and operated deli. Prices are almost as amazing as the food!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, fair prices and friendly staff. There is an ample menu that pleases everyone in the family and the portions aren't small. Quick service, if you're in a hurry, but plenty of space if you want to hang out for a while and enjoy the company of those you came with. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Fresh Salads, generous sandwiches, Fast service, Friendly atmosphere, smiling wait-staff! This is a great place to bring your family, and an easy stop for the lunch crowd. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We go here often and love it. Great breakfast at a reasonable cost and it's a nice deli for lunch. Quick service and a friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast because I had heard good things... very let down... Got biscuits and gravy and a bacon and egg plate... The biscuits were alright but the gravy looked at tasted like it came from a can and the bacon on my plate was cooked to the point of cremation.... Just wasn't that good..."}
{"text":"Great place for a solid sandwich. I got the turkey Reuben and the hubs got brisket, pastrami and corned beef-  he's found a new love. I've been here three times and both the service and the food have been great, not to mention the prices are very affordable. I look forward to trying out the all day breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Clean but unattractive decor. Definitely NOT a Jewish style deli compared to anything from the NY/NJ. The sandwiches are skimpy and Phil (the owner) told me that they use Boars Head meat. I told him I could get that at Harris Teeter. A restaurant should actually cook in their kitchen! I couldn't eat the Reuben, it was awful. I was prepared to pay for it and then leave. The waitress apologized and didn't charge me for my sandwich. Their chopped liver which IS, however, homemade is delicious so I bought some to take home. This being my second visit here confirms that I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is an amazing family owned deli!  The food is amazing and their service even better. Clean restaurant with friendly staff and it doesn't break the bank to eat there.  The tomato bisque was delicious served with a grilled cheese sandwich and get this, you get to choose the cheese!  Absolutely love this place!  I will be bringing the family back to experience this little gem!"}
{"text":"I agree with the reviewer who spoke of the pushy waitress.  Brother!  There was only one other couple in the whole restaurant.  So it was not like she was busy and overloaded with orders.  Her manners and demeanor were downright offensive.  The food was greasy, greasy, greasy.  Omelets were absolutely swimming in grease!  The ambiance was brown, brown, and more brown.    Pass on this place . . ."}
{"text":"I visited with my newborn during the early lunch hour. I was greeted promptly and served a fabulous freshly made hamburger with fresh, hot fries. My drink stayed full. I overstayed my welcome to feed the baby and wasn't rushed out or made to feel unwelcome. The family-owned atmosphere will bring my business back for sure. Seating is plentiful and parking readily available. Very happy with my experience!"}
{"text":"Place is clean. Staff is very friendly and nice. Sandwiches are a big disappointment if you know Jewish deli from the Midwest or Northeast.  Skimpy at best. Prices are way too high for what you get!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast and lunch.  Does try to cater to the New York/northeastern tastes with sandwiches and deli type of items.  Like that you can order a regular sandwich with a smaller, more normal portion of meat/filling or a larger size for an additional price.  Very fair.  They make their own light rye bread, which is very good.  Their potato pancakes are awful.  They are small and fried so are dry and flavorless.  Opt for something else.  Potato salad and slaw are better alternatives.  It is OK."}
{"text":"Very very good sandwiches!!! Large portions of meat and decent bread.  The service, on the other hand, is absolute garbage. Super pushy. Not friendly. She walked away when she decided I was done ordering instead of asking if I wanted anything else. I did, but decided against it since she was obviously done taking my order.  I guess if you don't want \"southern hospitality\" and enjoy the rude New York deli feel then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Me and my mom come here all the time, usually for the breakfast. We LOVE It, omelets are great, hash browns fast delicious, wait staff is kind. I'm shocked to see it doesn't have higher reviews!"}
{"text":"I visited for the first time yesterday with my family.  Friday evening around 6:15 and there were plenty of open seats but at first glance this place looks great on the inside.  It's a very nice space.  Located right next to the Publix in an area that has been starving for good food for quite some time. We were greeted promptly and handed a handwritten special menu which outlined the daily specials and sides.  Sitting down at a nice booth near the kitchen area and opening the menu you are immediately overwhelmed by the shear amount of offerings.  OMG, it took me 10 - 15 minutes to figure out what I wanted which was OK in my book.  In the back of my mind with the lack of traffic that I saw this evening how does anything stay fresh?  The waitress came over and took our drink orders and was a little pushy about asking for our order IMO, with that size menu she's got to realize it's going to take a new arrival some time you know? We ordered 2 things off the kids menu for the little ones and I ordered a steak and cheese sandwich which was served on a hoagie roll and a side of potato salad.  Sweetie ordered the salmon special with cole slaw and pasta salad.  The kids tender meal was underwhelming and served with 2 overly breaded foodservice chicken tenders and less than a handful of fries.  For $6.50 I expected more.  My steak and cheese hoagie was mostly bread and the steak was not seasoned and didn't have any dressing of any sort.  Ergo, it was flavorless and dry.  I paid an extra $.60 for mushrooms which offered a small amount of flavor but again I was mostly eating bread.  I will say the potato salad was very good.  Sweetie said her salmon was over cooked and dry.  We left with a piece of lemon pound cake to go which according to Sweetie was the best part of the meal. Hey, it's somewhat new and I possibly ordered the wrong thing.  In theory I liked the concept of a deli like back home, corned beef, pastrami, brisket, burgers etc....I saw plenty of the Sun City Crowd which may explain the blandness but in order to draw in repeat business, they need to jazz things up a bit."}
{"text":"The owners of this restaurant have another location in Charlotte that has been open a very long time, and I can't, for the life of me, figure out why! My husband and I LOVE a good deli and were so excited to see this place so close to home. The excitement wore off about 5 minutes into the visit. Service was okay, but felt like I had to order and get out in record time. I ordered a Ruben and my husband ordered a corned beef sandwich. They should be ashamed of themselves with the quality of bread and corned beef that they serve. The cole slaw and potato salad tasted like they bought it packaged from Walmart or Sam's Club. There is nothing special about this place and I can make a better corned beef brisket at home, which isn't saying much. Skip this place. Sadly we still have to wait to get a good New York deli in Charlotte and surrounding."}
{"text":"What a great place to go for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!  Have tried all three and could not be happier.  I have been going to Phil's Deli for years in town but so happy they have expanded out to this area!  Just like Phil's I love the family owned atmosphere and that they make you feel right at home when you walk in.  Friendly staff and wonderful food!  However, the food of course is my favorite part!  LOVE LOVE the Challah French Toast, what a treat!  And you can never go wrong with the Reuben!  Will definitely be back to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"really good jewish style deli.  try the matzo ball soup and the sandwiches rock....   phil and his family are very friendly and the service was great.    !!! phil, thanks for opening in lancaster they needed it !!!! waxhaw resident from new jersey"}
{"text":"Have ate breakfast here and \"dinner\" once. First of all there is nothing \"special\" about the specials on the breakfast menu. No special prices or anything. The specials are on the everyday menu. Not happy with cost for the quality of the food. Suspect breakfast potatoes were from a freezer or cooked, frozen, and reheated. Eggs were good, but most people can cook an egg.  The time I went for dinner was between 7-8 pm during a weekday. The cook had just turned off the grill, so no burgers or hot cooked stuff. I ended up having a tuna sandwich on the smallest wheat bread ever, tomato and lettuce. And a VIP of reheated tomato soup. Totally underwhelmed and paid over $12 for this meal. Poor quality, little quantity food.  Way over priced for the area.   Really had high hopes for this place. They need to make changes or good bye."}
{"text":"I live close to Uptown Charlotte, so it's a bit of a drive to get here. Twice I made the trip and it was closed (on a Saturday), but deli is my fav go to food, and I was in the area. For a newly opened place in a growing area the interior decor person needs to be fired...or one hired. It's brown...dark, medium and darker brown. They have a huge space and could be a busy thriving deli, since you can eat breakfast ALL day, plus a huge selection of deli foods. It pretty much ends there. When I closed the menu, and saw Phil's is also one of their restaurants (Providence & Sardis Rds in CLT) my heart sank...been there and stopped doing that years ago. I had already placed my order for a reuben on rye and side of slaw....$9.  The sandwich pastrami was completely tasteless, although it appeared to be 'real' cooked at the restaurant pastrami.  It was tough as shoe leather, to the point I had to disassemble the sandwich and cut the meat with a knife. It was a fair amount of meat, but not 'piled high' like a Jason's reuben. The coleslaw was 'from the bag' type slaw, without any celery seed or other seasoning and just a mouthful, nothing I would serve as a side.  I am truly disappointed as I LOVE deli foods, but the Bible Belt cannot seem to get deli food right. I got mine to go, so really didn't deal with the waitress, buy she was working alone, and I can see where that might be over whelming to any waitress. I might try again, just because I go to Indianland every few weeks and try not to judge any wateringhole by one attempt. These folks could 'rock it' where they are located...please read these reviews...DO BETTER!"}
{"text":"Now that Katz New York Deli in Arboretum has closed, this is my new go to spot for when I need proper New York Jewish food. It's not the same, but it's darned close.  I had a triple decker sandwich of pastrami and turkey on homemade pumpernickel and it was excellent. The bread was very rich and tasty. The sandwich was delicious. Was it the quarter mile thick pile of meat that I would have preferred? No. But it was still very good.  My wife chose the nova platter and it was a nice serving of thinly sliced salmon, with onions and tomato and cream cheese. A small pot of capers topped it off for perfection.  It's not perfect but I am absolutely a fan and will be back."}
{"text":"I ate here today with my wife and parents - and it was just ok. I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but it was never open when I went by. I watched someone get turned away today at 2:40 because the grill was off - they close at 3:00!  There is nothing special about the Ruben at all - even though they named it after someone. I'm a Ruben lover - so I was a little disappointed. Prices seemed a little high for what you get as well, though I enjoyed the potato salad. The decor is basically just many shades of brown paint, and there are some odd black and white pictures on he wall with mirror frames.   I commented that they could take all the tables out and it could be a shoe store overnight. There is very little about it that feels like a deli - and the food wasn't bad but I probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Just moved down from NJ And was very happy to find a deli!! Very clean, friendly staff, well priced and fast service.  We had Matzo ball soup and the pastrami Ruben  Both very good! My only complaint would be they should be putting more meat on the sandwiches  Up North the meat is piled high, so that's just what I'm use to. We definitely will be going back to try more things."}
{"text":"The place was half full for lunch on a Saturday.  I was barely able to sit before the waitress came and asked what we wanted to drink.  As I was opening the menu, my diet coke appeared and she asked us what we wanted.  Umm, I have been here for less than 30 seconds. We asked her to give us a minute.  In 30 seconds we figured out what we were going to order and put the menus down. Twelve minutes later, I was watching her check people out, touch tables, etc. yet still did not come back for our order.  We gave it another 2-3 minutes....bye!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. We are moving nearby and like to have different options. Unfortunately, nothing worth coming back for here. Place is clean, service is efficient but that's it for the positives. The bland atmosphere reflects the bland food. We tried several items and all were flavorless. Don't bother."}
