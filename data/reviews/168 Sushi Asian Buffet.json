{"text":"Pretty good selection, with a reasonable price. I like how you can easily order what you want from the iPad. The photos are pretty accurate, except for the garlic bread... Which I don't really recommend. This is a great place for friends and family, parties :)

The service wasn't bad at all, everything came pretty quickly and drinks were always filled."}
{"text":"168 Sushi is the place to go if you want fair priced all you can eat sushi. I cannot say the sushi quality is the best (it appears to me the sushi quality is decreasing over the years, but still acceptable), but it has the best value for your money. 

I think 168 is among the first restaurants that use the ipad ordering system (at least the first restaurant I've been to), it is very easy to use and very efficient. Best part of the system is that you know what you have ordered, and you'll know if they skip your order. 

The variety of the food is good and I'm happy with the quantity as well. The sushi rolls are typically 4 pieces, unlike some other places where the rolls are usually 6 to 8 pieces, so you get full very quickly. The small quantity made it possible for us to try more things."}
{"text":"Love the iPad menu! Detailed pics are great for each order especially if you bring someone who is new to the AYCE sushi world! Every item comes out promptly and fresh. 

Decor is cute. Been here a few times on dates and with friends. 

Great atmosphere. Sometimes the service is okay but still a good time :) 

Just an FYI they only except credit or cash but NO debit."}
{"text":"This place is one of the few all you can eat restaurants which serves food with good quality. It has a good variety of dishes and the price is reasonable.
Liked it a lot"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. The food is delicious, and there is lot's of variety. The food comes out fast, and the staff is attentive and are always there to refill your drink. Best of all it sums up to about $20 with taxes, tips, and drinks. Will come back definitely."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi restaurants in the GTA.  

The restaurant is clean and well-maintained and the washrooms are clean! 
This is a great place for an intimate dinner, family gathering, or even a party.  
The food is fresh and served quickly - just order on your ipad and send!  

I would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just came here on the Father's Day. Nice environment, good service. Like the convenient way of using iPad for ordering. Good price for the food. Just a bit of noisy."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Brampton! Awesome sevice new and incredible tasting. Incredible client administration. Whatever you can eat."}
{"text":"I give this 4 stars based on value and quality.  Great value and great sashimi.  Good selection.
Staff is nice but either they or the people in the kitchen constantly forget dishes you ordered."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, clean... All good
The only thing that comes to my mind is that some staff don't know English. But everything else is awesome and i DO recommend it."}
{"text":"Big variety of food, good service and nice atmosphere. I spent very good time with my friends there and enjoy tasty seafood. 5 star buffet, recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"This is the best all you can eat sushi place we been to so far with decent price. The service was good but a bit noisy maybe because there were too many little kids that day. Weekend they served snow crab leg as well. Sashimi are fresher compared to all other all you can eat places. Sushi rolls were alright, this place actually served grilled mackerel which I loved."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the place. Great idea for interactive ordering through iPad. They delivered first items with speed of light! I'm a sushi person so I found them pretty tasty. Great selection. My son ordered meat and he liked it. Nice design. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Cross AYCE Sushi/Asian Buffet with a salad/desert bar and iPad ordering system and you get a very good time. My only qualm is sometimes some food items were never ordered, but this is usually because I go to this place on their busiest days. However, their waiters and waitresses are incredibly nice and quickly cater to any problems.

Now, if only I went there on less busy times..."}
{"text":"Service is bad and management is horrible. Especially the people who are working in the cashier I believe, do not know how to speak to other people my goodness. The food is alright, but there are many more better ayce sushi places."}
{"text":"After ate here, we don't go anywhere else. This is the best Japanese buffet in Gta. They are very friendly, fast, clean, good food, inexpensive. I love it and will come back again. Don't forget to ask them about ten times dine in you will have free dinner. 
Ps:  I had try the restaurant at Mississauga but its not that good like this one (the one in Vaughn)."}
{"text":"I have been here at least a dozen or more times but I am finally giving up for good.
Spoon and Fork is better service and portions so I'm annoyed I forgot how bad 168 is and came back.
I have never received what order in certain they do on purpose.
This time my friend kept ordering it and finally they brought it the last time
The service is terrible they come to see what you need but then can't understand what I'm saying and never come back with what we ask for.
Always a disappoint"}
{"text":"Ate here last year. Very sketchy. Food hygiene seems a bit weird, ie crab legs leaking onto the desserts. I would not go here if you have any severe allergies. Also we were initially seated right beside a cart full of dirty dishes, which was pretty gross, and annoying when the servers would come and dump their plates. Fortunately they moved us to another table at our request. Definitely not worth the prices they were charging for a lunch buffet."}
{"text":"There's nothing more delightful then feeling full until you burst. All you can eat is always made for this but its more fun with an ipad =) 168 sushi now has ipad ordering system with great pictures so you'll never need to wonder what something is again.

The food is pretty general. They do have some rolls that I haven't seen before like those made with rice paper so those are definitely worth a try. I have noticed however that the quality sometimes fluctuates. Sometimes the same thing I order taste a little more or less fresh. So consistency is a problem here but never bad tasting.

One thing I admire about this location is the space! I have never needed to wait for a table at this location no matter how many people I go with. On birthdays they can even play tge birthday song for you over their sound system so it's really great for birthdays.

I wouldn't give it perfect just because of the consistency issue but if you are having trouble deciding where to bring the whole family for a night out definite give them a shot."}
{"text":"I m very picky on sushi. This place is absolutely a sushi heaven. Not only the sushi and sashimi are fresh, the dessert are great And lots of choices. The only complaints that I would have its one of the waitress there are not very friendly, but most of them are great. Price are very reasonable with many choices of food and sushi. I would recommend this sushi restaurant especially mommy with strollers, because its lots of spaces and very clean n neat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Overall, the food tastes OK.There are hits and misses. Sushi dishes are good. The grilled and fried dishes are OK except the grilled mackerel fish is very salty and the fried scallops do not taste like actual scallops but in mixture of lots of sticky rice flour and whatever that has no scallop flavor. The portions are small so order extra. Also, there are not any vegetable dishes as well as the very poor dessert selection, only two kind of cakes cut in small squares, ice cream but there are no fruits :( Water melons are so cheap in summer time but they can't even offer. They know  if you eat fruits to cleanse your palate you will order more. I'd rather go to the AYCE in a traditional way where foods are in the open and you can scoop whatever you want. Here you sit scrolling up and down on the ipad with 4 or 5 other heads trying to decide what to order. The small screen strains your eyes! It is like you have only one menu to share with 4 others. Although the service is fast. Foods come out quickly and servers take your dirty plates right away to make room for the new ones,  this kind of technology does not work for me. My dinning experience at AYCE felt confined and on ration. I got full quickly after the 6th rolls of sushi because of sitting too long at one place. the excitement at eating of a AYCE place is for you to explore, smell, see and taste the variety of foods but at this place all of that is out of the window.  I did not want to keep ordering and having servers keep bringing more dishes. the d√©cor looks normal to me, nothing spectacular like many boast about. I give the service 4 stars and the food 3 star."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. Great atmosphere, fresh food, friendly service. 
I like how they have the salad bar. And the iPad ordering system makes the ordering process much smoother than those AYCE places."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! Very cheap, especially weekday lunch (13.99) especially because it's all you can eat.. Great menu.. 1 dollar buttonless soft drink, good ice cream . Overall a great sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of AYCE sushi and certainly not a huge fan of buffets. But I like this place. It's located on a crappy, inconspicuous plaza on Dufferin/Steeles, right beside Value Village. The location does not look promising, but the food here is definitely worth it! 
I've been 3 times - once with a friend, once with my family and another time with a group of 6 people. We've always gone at lunch, because we're cheap and don't want to pay $27 per person during dinner time. And to be honest, it's not worth $27. Lunch is only around $15 per person, and you get a rather extensive menu, so I recommend going for lunch. 
There are a lot of options on the AYCE sheet - many different rolls, sushi & handrolls. (no sashimi on lunch menu). There is also an extensive menu of things like noodles, meats, fish, dumplings, etc. 
The food is very fresh and tasty. The sushi is pretty good - not SPECTACULAR but what do you expect from an AYCE place? It's definitely up to par or better than other AYCE sushi places I've been to. 
The salad/soup bar is pretty awesome. They have great miso soup and seaweed salad! Also, 3 types of cake and ice cream. 
The service is great. Very quick and all the staff is friendly and polite. The food arrives quickly.
I'll be back for more $15 lunches :)"}
{"text":"Yes, they have ipads for ordering, but thats not what makes this place great; its the quality of the food that makes it great. Good sushi, good cooked food, and a nice variety. The menu can be extended a bit in the desert department; ice cream and cake only (i would upgrade them to 5 stars if the desert was improved). 

Overall a nice place, with above average niceness by the staff."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here!  The service is fantastic! I have had better sushi! Personally not a big fan of warm sushi. There is egg and mayo in a lot of it, just not for me. Would return if hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"Great place and fresh food! One of my favorite sushi restaurant in North York for sure! Better to do reservation or take out :) Busy on the weekends"}
{"text":"This place deserve 5 stars not only because of great foods, but the servers are the nicest people. You can't get any better deals than this. Buffet all u can eat  included  crab leg, amazing green tea ice cream, etc for $26. Give it a try and you won't regret."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!!!! THEY SERVE SPOILED FOOD!!! 

This was one of our \"go-to\" sushi places for a while. I took my family our for treat on Wednesday Aug 17/16. Fairly early in the dinner, a roll came out that my daughter couldn't identify. There was avocado and something dark-brown/black. We asked the server what it was, she looked at it and wasn't sure. She came back saying that it was an avocado roll and that some of the avocado was bad, so they should eat around it and walked away. We called her back to say that we don't want this on our table (it was gross!). She asked if we wanted to replace it. My daughter had lost her appetite and didn't want to eat any more, as she wasn't comfortable with the food being served. She left the restaurant. i asked twice for the manager, who would not come to the table. Our bill came without a discount or apology. I asked to see the manager again, and he still refused to come by. WILL NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"Of all the All-U-Can Eat places I've been to this is the cheapest and has the most options. It's been our go-to place if we just want to gorge on sushi.

They have tons of rolls, food options, anything you can think of that you want. They also have a soup and salad bar that you can help yourself too. 

The quality of the rolls and fish is not great, the service is very fast, and pop is included in the price. 

Overall don't expect the highest quality, but if you are hungry and ready to overeat for a good price then this is the place we head too!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times since it was opened. But last night will be my last. 
Interior is nice. 
Service is ok. 
I like that we can use the table / iPad to order so we're not waving down a waiter every time we want to order. 
It's nice they have Salad/soup bar and you can get your own ice cream. 
Food is mediocre compared to all the other sushi places in the area. Price is ridiculous. $27.97 for a WEEKDAY DINNER AYCE! the most expensive AYCE in the area. I won't be coming back here especially when I know there is another sushi place close by that has a better dinner menu and is cheaper."}
{"text":"We were initially not supposed to go here for my parent's 25th anniversary but the restaurant we wanted to go to was packed so we decided to go here. The AYCE Dinner was above average IMO, although it had an extensive menu with sashimi and all the good stuff, the quality of the food was not the best.

What to expect
-The restaurant is ULTRA trendy with their neon purple lights, iPad ordering system and modern atmosphere.

-Servers are sufficient and speak English well.

-iPad ordering system makes you think that you are ordering  a lot for example: it will say you're getting 10 items, but you're really only getting 10 pieces of sushi.

-Washrooms are clean and modern looking as well.

What to eat
-Sushi was pretty fresh but the slices of fish were a little small compared to the amount of rice, but isn't as bad as other AYCE places.

-Sashimi was ok, not too flavourful.

-LOVED the shrimp tempura, it was crispy, light and not too greasy unlike other restaurants.

-Miso soup was as it should be, nothing special but is a must every time you go to a Japanese restaurant

-Maki rolls were a delicious and they had some original rolls (e.g the fruit roll which tastes AWESOME- peach and mango wrapped in rice paper with mango sauce)

-All other dishes were just OK, at least everything was seasoned well and everything tasted as it should be. 

-Salad, soup and desert bar can found near the entrance! Make sure you go there while waiting for your food but do not grab too much."}
{"text":"the best sushi buffet to go to, everything is always fresh and delicious, made to order. they are always accommodative to me and my specific orders. the staff is very friendly and helpful, you'll feel very welcome and never rushed. furthermore, theres a warning that says something like , \" please dont order more than you can eat, if you order food and dont eat it we'll have to charge you \" and me being a fat glutinous turd i always order more than i can eat. but they are always so nice they have NEVER charged me and always let me take it home for freee! they pack it up nicely and dont give me any hassle. I LOVE IT HERE. LOOOOVE THE FOOD. LOVE THE PEOPLE. LOVE THE CLEANLINESS AND LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great selection of sushi and kitchen items. Love the fresh raw fish. Service is ok, given how busy they get on weekends. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was sitting at table 7A during lunch time, the senior server's attitude is so terrible that I promise I will never go to this restaurant any more, they changed the lemon chicken from large to small size somehow, I wonder what happened to this place....."}
{"text":"I come here atleast once or twice a month. They've got the best hot and sour soup hands down. I've tried many hot and sour soup in my life and I'd give their hot and sour soup 12/10. The sushi is also very good as well as their avocado crisp roll one of the bests I've ever had. The only negative thing I can say about this place though is the miso soup is so watered down it doesn't even taste like miso anymore and I love miso soup. As well as the dishes could be cleaner as I found food particles couple of times I've been here on the dishes on the side of the buffet section."}
{"text":"My favourite AYCE sushi place. Huge variety and the ipad menu makes the service much better than the 168 sushi locations I had previously visited in Ottawa."}
{"text":"Buffets are like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get.  

168 Sushi Asian Buffet  just recently opened in the area, service to the Yelp community I volunteed myself today to try it for lunch. :)
   
The restaurant offers Thai, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese selections. Majority of the food is orderable a from a menu except for  soup/salad/dessert which is available at a stand-up bar near the front of the restaurant.
      
The interior is spacious, decorated in dark black and purple colours. The restaurant is located in the corner unit of the plaza with large windows bringing in sunlight from all around. There's a variety of seating arrangements available: rounded booths, table seating, and bench seating. The music playing was pop contemporary. In the back corner there's sushi chefs visible.

Experience: 
On the menu, it says \"all you can enjoy\" :)   ha-ha not all you can eat...  

Ok this is what I find, depending on the party you go with, some go buck wild and order everything on the menu and your table end up with mountains of food that no one wants to eat. This isn't the way to go about with buffets in my opinion. 
. 
From chaos, there is order. I suggest picking things that are agreeable with others you're going to share with.  Order a little bit: sample appetizers, hot foods, sushi,  stir-fried dishes, to get a feel. Compose a meal.  
  
The first round my parents got their early and it was too late.  A mish mash of all kinds on the table. Second round I ordered and set it straight.

In short nothing I had here was exemplary or memorable and I am taking into account that this is a buffet not a fancy shmancy gourmet restaurant. 

ie. Tempura was dripping of grease, the Terriyaki Salmon was not fresh (they re-made it right after mentioning this), Terriyaki Beef was round steak and tough, Japchae noodles were so soyed, Pad Thai had no taste to it, Sui Mai tasted of the frozen variety.  The sushi though was alright. Spicy Salmon roll with crunchy bits tightly packed not too much rice. Avocado Sushi Pizza, and Egg Sushi  tasted good and were presented well.
     
Wait service was very good though; they were quick at clearing dishes, listened to feedback and did something about it, topped off our teas voluntarily. But some were a tad too chatty.  
  
Granted for the person who doesn't eat Asian food may not know the difference of authentic foods may like it. Where it's located demographically, there isn't that much of a population of Asians to be critical to it.
 
I'm a believer of if you're going to do something, do it well.  My suggestion would be to cut down the selections and offer up some quality not just quantity."}
{"text":"Good food, nice decor, fast service, and most importantly a decent price. Oh yeah, and ipads for ordering food. That pretty much sums up 168 sushi buffet in my opinion. But there's a few highs and lows worth sharing. 

I'm a fan of sushi and buffets and lucky for me this place does both. When talking about the quality of the sushi and other menu items it definitely hits my standard for a $15 lunch price. It's fresh and never shoddily made, I've never been served anything that remotely looks like seaweed with a bit of rice mashed into it. So that's a plus. Good selection as well, I'm not much for sashimi but they've got a whole offering of them too. 

They also have teriyaki and meat items that have killer sauces or seasoning, buuutt fall short on the amount of meat inside. For example, when you order something like Crispy OK chicken, don't expect there to be a hunk of chicken. But hey, once again, for $15 (weekday lunch) I'm not complaining with their other menu options. 

Good decor, a little dark (lighting wise, lol) and classy, so you can get away with calling it a date night if you go there for dinner. But here's the ultimate con: dinner will cost you around $26 per person and that entitles you to few more options in the dinner menu (which I'm never upset about missing when I go to lunch and save a wad of cash). 

So in short, go for a week day lunch if you can, if not another $4 for a weekend lunch will suffice. But never, and I repeat, never, try treating your five person family for dinner on a Saturday. Just a warning for your wallet. 

But seriously just go once for the iPad experience, it's something you'll gawk over for a day or so."}
{"text":"False advertising. Its marked as $$ but it's $$$..
The food doesn't look that good either. Doesn't worth the wait or the money!!!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite AYCE sushi places.  The sushi rolls and sashimi are good quality for an AYCE.  Huge selection of menu items.  Service has also been very good on each of our visits. The restaurant is always busy, even on weeknights.  If you plan on going here on a weekend be sure to make reservations.  Had to wait for an hour on one visit."}
{"text":"Not the most affordable option, but excellent food and great service. Our server (not sure if it was actually the manager) was very accommodating and checked on us multiple times to make sure we were doing alright. Food was yummy, especially loved their ribs!"}
{"text":"I give 2 star because of service , if there party booked they don't even tell or set ANY type of notification at all, lunch is until 3.30 pm but if party they say even you come at 3 but must pay as for dinner. Again, food is fine, customer service : -5 star I guess they think got busy so no matter what's going on and screw all of them let's serve them like in China
Not going back there at all"}
{"text":"Pretty good AYCE place. Never a huge fan of any AYCE but fish was fresh, food came out very fast, decent service. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Really great variety of rolls. They were all very different and delicious. We liked every single one we ordered. Would have ordered doubles, but we got too full. 

Everything was very fresh and prepared very quickly. 

They have an all-you-can-eat soup and salad bar. It's a little redundant though. Considering the entire menu is all-you-can-eat anyways. But I guess it gets you to stand up and walk around, stretch out your stomach for more. 

Gave it a 4 star because it's more expensive than most places and we went on a weekday. Otherwise this place was awesome. We will return only if we want to splurge."}
{"text":"Best sushi buffet in the area. We used their large party room and it accommodated about 70+ people. The service was fast and the room is kind of secluded so it was perfect for a large party. 
The meals was fresh and delicious. Although the picture in the menu is a little deceiving. For example, we ordered salmon teriyaki but when we got the order is was more like a slither of salmon. It was sooo thin and small compare to the picture. So we ordered more right away.
My tip is, if you're going for the buffet order your items in doubles! Or even triple!

Great place!"}
{"text":"It is an ok all you can eat sushi place.  A level lower compared to some of the better ones in Scarborough and Markham area.  Definitely need to improve on their kitchen items,  sushi and rolls are pretty much decent.

Not familiar with the west end of the city but it is a decent place.  If you are in the east end or in the middle,  then I wouldn't go there.  There are a lot of better ones like I said in Scarborough and Markham."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and it's decent place to go for sushi.  The price is fairly ok for a buffet and the amount of food/fish /sushi they provide and serve. Good service and friendly staff. 

The food came on time and the fish was fresh. They also have a salad bar that you can go and help yourself while your order comes. 
The salad bar includes soups, assorted veggies, salads and deserts.

- note: make sure you order the amount you can handel to eat as they will charge you extra if there's a food left without being touched.

The only thing that I didn't like, however, was where they sat us. We were seated in the family section where there were too many children with their family and the noise level was very high and the children were running around. 
You can imagine how hard it could get walking around with food in your hands. 

I give it a 4 star as overall service was very good."}
{"text":"I come to this location at least once a month... great variety of items and the ordering system via tablet is much improved over the pencil/paper.

I hate warm sushi/surimi/sashimi...  means it's been handled too much.... this place the items are made to order and at the best (cool) temperature.

If I have any negative comments about this location, it would be around the mini salad bar.  The alternating crab legs or shrimp nights are great, but the seafood is a little over cooked... the shrimp is bland, rubbery and a very pale pink in colour (over cooked), not the best for peel and eat.  The crab legs can also be cooked a little less to be a little sweeter in flavour.

Love the creamy corn chicken soup, dim sum and perogies (yes, perogies served on the dim sum menu)!

The servers are quick and attentive to clear your dishes and refill your drinks or water."}
{"text":"In general I do not like all you can eat restaurants but this place is very nice 
You order from a menu so you do not have to stand in line for the food ( you order from a computer so it's kind of cool)
The food is very good
It's a fun place to go with the all family"}
{"text":"Went out with a friend and we decided to give this place a try.  It's new in the area but a chain, there are some others elsewhere in the GTA.

The place looks like a bar not an all you can eat sushi joint.  The music is really loud and the tables are really close together.

The wait service we experienced was unbelievably overbearing!  You'd hardly have the last piece of sushi off a plate and the 3 spies 5 feet away would be descending on the table and reaching across your face to take the empty dish.  Over the course of 5 minutes we informed 6 different wait staff to leave the \"empty\" bowl we were using for our edamama shells ON the table and stop trying to take it.  One waitress went so far as to pull another off to the cash counter point and sneer at us - completely unacceptable.  The service was genuinely annoying!  Yet the servers were nowhere to be found when you actually needed something and definitely had some difficulties getting by in english (which isn't entirely uncommon for an AYCE joint, but typically you can get by)

They also made a big deal out of us asking to change tables due to some disturbing and unwelcome conversation by other patrons right next to us - tables are a little close for comfort, booths are nicely spaced.

The \"buffet\" salad bar was more reminiscent of Sunday morning brunch than any type of Asian establishment.  Romaine salad with a variety of dressings, 4 different kinds of soup, crab legs, a bunch of different \"salads\" of sorts (corn, chicken, one looked like it had shrimp, another chick peas) there were about 8 or 10 all told - didn't try any of them.  Soups didn't look appetizing.  All we had from the buffet was the ice cream (nothing special/nothing to complain about)

The 23.95 any night of the week for an adult is a little pricey for what they offer, I can get a bigger selection, better quality, better service and a few dollars off at other AYCE joints equal distance from my house.

Deep fried or greasy food was REALLY greasy, didn't want to eat it greasy, a few unique items that were tasty.  Had 4 different varieties of cuisines, Thai, Japanese, Korean, Japanese.  Lemongrass beef tasted like it was teriyaki not lemongrass even though waitress insisted it was the lemongrass dish.  Edemame overcooked by a long shot.  
Will say that the, I think it was called \"cripsy milk pudding\" it's a dessert item, was pretty delicious.  Asparagus bacon roll also pretty good (hard do mess up bacon!)

Definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go back"}
{"text":"They have a variety choice of menu. However, seafood is a little bit cold. In general, it was a great meal here"}
{"text":"Pretty decent. The service was friendly and quick. The food overall was pretty good, but I find that the rice in the sushi rolls tend to fall out quite a bit. Dynamite Rolls were pretty good, the grilled eggplant had a bit too much sauce though. What bothered me was the lighting - it's very bright, fluorescent and distracting. Music was a bit loud and bothersome. Overall a decent place to go for AYCE Sushi but there is definitely better in the GTA."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, fresh and orders are accurate.  Uses iPads to place order which is much quicker than conventional ways.  Was with a large group and they did a good job of knowing which table ordered what.  Only complaint was one iPad crashed and they didn't fix it for us.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on Mothers Day afternoon, but because of the lineup, I decided to return instead today (Monday). I am usually undecided between 168 Vaughn and 168 Mississauga as to which is the best. Today it was Vaughn's turn to shine. The kitchen items were terrific today. The sashimi was OK. Unlike most AYCE Sushi restaurants, this one has a soup, desert and salad bar that is constantly refreshed. Since I have been a regular customer, I will obviously be back again and again."}
{"text":"Food was good but took forever to get made with no updates. Don't come for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I may be more impressed with the iPad machinery you order from, than the actual food served and I was impressed with how fresh the food was!

I've been here previously, before they had this new ordering system and it was meh. I'm happy that improvements have been made to efficiency and food! Some items that stand out on their menu is red tuna and hamachi.

The ordering tablet keeps track of how many items you have already ordered, and once processed, they arrive pretty quickly. 

I'm not sure what all the hype was about with the shrimp in maggi sauce - it was dry and A-OK at best. The beef kalbi, however, was delicious! The meat was surprisingly tender, and the sides not burnt like most places. I also loved the fried milk - I haven't seen this offered at any other AYCE Sushi places, so this is a must order for me. 

Some items that I won't bother ordering again:
1. Fried OK Tofu (?) - refer to picture, it tastes just as sad as it looks
2. Thousand Island Sauce shrimp - not enough sauce
3. Shrimp in Maggi Sauce - really unimpressed with this dish
4. Any soup items in the buffet section - soups weren't hot enough, and the area needs to be wiped periodically otherwise I don't even want to touch the stained ladle. 

Overall, I had a good experience here. The price is a little higher than other AYCE places, but with the convenience factor, I feel it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time; I must say it's very worth the hype ! The sushi and in fact everything we ordered was delicious. Went on a Friday night so crab legs were available as well. The decor and atmosphere was all around appealing, quick service as well. A bit pricey for weekend dinner but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly! Loved the technological concept of ordering by an i pad! But the food was just okay, I found it too heavy, sushi was somewhat big and stuffed from what I'd personally like. They have the mango shrimp which was good but again heavy. I wouldn't go back there for sushi. It's an all you can eat concept."}
{"text":"Came here with quite a few people after bubble soccer, so we were hungry!  Lets get down to logistic of the place:

Seating: The place is bug and has quite a bit of place to seat.

Ordering system: quite sophisticated as you have to order in a tablet and the food keeps coming.

Menu: its not just a sushi joint the menu was huge and had other items as well.

Service: was quite good the kept coming fast. 

Food: Well it was all you can eat and we tied a lot and I mean it a lot of sushi and sushimi and all the fish were fresh. The seaweed salad was good and the shrimp dumpling was so good.

The dessert had decent choices!!!

Parking: plenty of parking as its in plaza. 

Its worth the visit so check it out if you are craving some fish!"}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of AYCE...mainly because I am not worth it. In dollar speak, I never eat as much as it is worth per person. I try to eat everything I see, but then my mind prevents me...instantly telling me how many stairs I have to climb, how many km I have to run in order to burn off all the carbs I inhale. FML.

One of my cousins decided to take us here for lunch to celebrate Mother's Day. Regular lunch prices are, I believe, $14, but because of the special occasion, it was $23/person (which is regular dinner pricing). I find that expensive. I had some of the crab legs to make it worth my while, but I had my usual Dynamite/Dragon rolls, noodles, rice, Sushi and Sashimi, Tempura, etc... Because this is an Asian buffet, you can also get Thai, Korean, and Chinese food. 

The majority of the ordering is done at your table; you mark down on a piece of paper what you want and how many orders. Buffet is for salad, desserts, and yup, the crab legs. I saw some hoarders pile up 15 of those long legs on their plate. I saw one being soo greedy that she dropped the legs on the floor...waste.

Service is EXCELLENT here. They are so efficient: always clearing your table, pouring tea, providing extra napkins and providing extra plates. Because the food comes fairly quickly, having someone frequently taking your plates away and cleaning is such a good thing. 

When we left at about 1pm, the place was packed. Lines were spilling outside the door, but it could be because of Mother's Day. This restaurant competes with Max's for parking space so caution; come early or be prepared to wait.

Overall, I had a good experience here and would recommend this place for BIG eaters and large groups. We ordered so much food that we had to do some \"artistic hiding\" because we couldn't finish."}
{"text":"I been to this location a few times now. They recently upgraded their menue from paper to tablets, all electronic and cool looking little app with nice pictures. You simply add the items and click send, done, then a few minutes later they bring you your order.
The food is good too, I don't have any problems with it, let's face it it is a buffet so keeping that in mind, I think the quality is decent/good.
The only one thing that I can't figure out is bbq eel, it is very inconsistant, I have ordered a few times and it seems depending on who does the cooking eithere it taste great or horrible.
I will certainly go back and recomend this place..."}
{"text":"I'd give it zero stars, if I could. Drove quite a ways to come here only to find out, they are open until 10:30pm but won't serve you past 10pm. And, if you order too much, they'll charge you per piece. I asked for consideration on the rushed order, but was declined.

For me, customer service is everything. If you're going to charge full price, at least serve until your noted closing hours on the door.

***update***
I had posted the above before the food even hit the table. Quality is mediocre at best. Everything was just OK. The hospitality was the worst I've ever encountered. Right at 10pm the server interrupted our meal and demanded that I pay immediately so they can close the system off. I offered debit... NO DEBIT! Fortunately I do have credit and paid the bill off. Though I didn't think it could, it got worse. The servers then started removing food off the table aaaaaand actually took the plate I was eating over..... WHILE I WAS STILL EATING, only a few minutes past 10pm.

I haven't reviewed many places. Only 7 on Yelp. This is my first bad review. I can handle going to a place and the food not being the greatest. It happens on occasion  but I don't typically make a deal out of it. But this place... Different story. 

A note to the owners and management:
You should feel nothing but shame for the way your staff treat clients towards the nights end. If you condone it, I hope for the sake of hospitality in the GTA - shape up or shut down.
Though I'm sure my disgust with your operation will have little effect on your bottom line, I will make it my mission to remind people of my visit to your restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food . They bring the food fast. It has a salad table, dessert and ice cream. And you order the ipad, every table has its own ipad. The food is quite tasty."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty. Service is good and the food comes out quickly once your order has been placed. You use a cool I-pad located on your table to place your orders. They also have a dessert/soup buffet station. This places is great for kids. 

It is quite pricy especially if you come after 330pm."}
{"text":"I went here for the first and last time tonight. Poor quality food and the atmosphere of a hospital cafeteria. This was hands down the worst place I have been to in a long time. We waited for forty minutes and eventually the three of us were seated at a table for two. The food came quickly which was good but it was generally flavourless. The best thing was probably the kalbi. There were a couple of dishes we nearly had to spit out like the grilled squid. 

You could do way better than this place!"}
{"text":"My 200th review, who would have thought I would be writing 200 reviews in less than 6 short months. And I can't think of a more suiting place deserving of my 200th spot then my recent experience at 168 Sushi Asian Buffet. 

Located on the North-West corner of Steeles and Dufferin in the Vaughan community of Concord (the neighbourhood I grew up in), 168 has secured itself a spot as a top 3 AYCE sushi spot in my mind.

Entering I almost felt like I had entered into a neon bathed night club circa Scarface 1980. The decor is awash in teals and pastel pink colours, but most importantly is the number of booths which fill this establishment. I really enjoy this element of privacy this provided, good for confidential meetings, dates, or to hide your face whilst stuffing it. They also have a private dining area which other than a secure door entrance isn't really all that private as it's surrounded by a wall of glass making it appear more like a fish bowl - trust me the irony of this is not lost on me (humans in a fish bowl...in a sushi restaurant).

Enough about the look and feel of this place, what about the food? I must echo the sentiments of previous yelpers, the food here is FRESH. I'm a huge proponent of sashimi and 168's portions are fresh, perfectly temperate and generous. Their Kalbi beef short ribs were some of the thickest and most tender I've encountered. Their sushi rolls we industry standard, nothing mind blowing but certainly met expectations to fill the hunger gaps between bites of sashimi. 

I honestly can't recall all the items we ordered as I was with a seasoned 168'er and I just ate what was put in front of me and didn't ask too many questions. However some menu standouts for me personally were the Shrimp w/ Maggie Sauce and their Shrimp Tempura. The shrimp tempura was the BEST, I've had at any sushi and/or asian fusion restaurant  EVER. Not overly battered, large, long, yum!

The final point of awesome for my money was the salad and soup buffet. It made so much more sense to be able to walk up and serve yourself all the Miso soup and seaweed salad I could. Saved time on orders and allowed me to have as much or as little as I wanted."}
{"text":"Very Specious and fast serving.
Foods are Fresh enough compare to other all you can eat."}
{"text":"This place not worth the price it's way overpriced for an AYCE and especially for the quality of the food. Everything I ordered tasted absolutely terrible, they even screwed up sushi. It's not fresh or good quality. I would understand if it busy and they were putting out this type of food but it wasn't very busy and now I understand why it wasn't. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone."}
{"text":"Shitty but quick service. They forget your order so many times. Be patient and just reorder.  Lunch AYCE option is pretty limited and pretty pricey, don't go here for dinner, find some other AYCE. Food wasn't that fresh, but it doesn't really matter since people just come to feel bloated. 

Note: Make sure to hit the salad bar and ice cream bar so you don't lose out on that AYCE dollars. Probably the only delicious thing from this place."}
{"text":"I been the the 168 in Sauga but this one is a lot better in many ways.  I went on a Friday night and it was not too busy.  Seating here is very comfortable and the decor is very modern.  There was a lot of wait staff and they were very polite as well.  

The food itself is very fresh especially the sashimi.  (see pic) The rolls are perfect balance and not stuff with 80% rice as other buffet does to try to fill you up.  (see pic). 

The best part is that they have a open bar of food including Snow crab legs.  Only thing I have to complain is the Miso Soup. How hard is it to make Miso Soup; that was the nastiest soup I ever had before and didn't taste anything like Miso.  Everything is restocks every 5 mins as I saw there is 1 person in charge of restocking it and she did a good job each time someone got some food from the bar. 

I am shocked how this place don't stand out as it deserve more praise, maybe it is the location which was middle of nowhere.  Looking to come here next time for more yummy sushi.  Pricing is reasonable as well for what you are getting.  Dessert consist of ice cream and some variety of cake. (located at the self serve bar)."}
{"text":"So so . For the 4 of us .I could of had better lunch at Mandarin. Some items we never received and menu is very limited.. Canada day service was slow , short staff .."}
{"text":"1 star for decor and iPad menus but nothing else. The food is not that great and the sushi is below average. You can do a lot better and cheaper for an all you can eat place."}
{"text":"With tips tax and no drinks. I paid around $40 (yes more money on weekends like all AYCE) 

I find this laughable as all Markham Richmond Hill have tons of AYCE for about $30 - the same identical menu MINUS the **hassle dessert bar**(self scoop empty bottom ice cream bin) 
And yes ofc they use the iPad format.. All these Asian places copy each other- the menu are 99% identical. 

This restaurant got lucky because of the location. Less competition and many 
non-asians in the area just don't know
 $40(no drinks) is ridiculous price for mediocre AYCE."}
{"text":"Great system to order on Ipad!the food comes in good time. Food is fresh, some portions are small so u need to double up the orders. The sushi and sashimi is fresh and portions are good for those. its a relaxing cool atmosphere and deco is very modern. the prices are alittle high, that wld prevent me from returning as often. 
My kids enjoy it, ive taken friends here and everyone loved it."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Good food options 
- Quick service 
- Small salad buffet while you wait 
- Newly renovated 

Cons:
- A little pricey"}
{"text":"168 South Asian Buffet is quite unique among Asian restaurants. We used to live in the area 5 years ago and went there quite often. This was very good place for sushi. Lately, they made a \"technology change\", in lieu of traditional menus, patrons are now given iPads to order from. While the food is still good, the service has suffered, it is not as good as it once was. It is probably because they cut on waiters with this replacement of the traditional menus with the iPads. It also looks like the prices went up... Next time I am in the mood for Asian food, I will think twice about going."}
{"text":"Went to this place yesterday for Sunday late lunch with a bunch of friends. We had reservation and the table was about 5 mins late, but it's ok since the place was extremely busy. 

It is All You Can Eat place.  I loved the iPad ordering because I am not a sushi eater and it was easy for me decide on the items by looking at the pictures and description. No need to explain what you want to a server, just send your order and get it within 10 mins. 

I am very picky eater, but I liked the rolls and tempura items that I had. The food was very fresh and tasty. 

The decor is modern and nice. 

Plenty of parking on the plaza."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi buffets when I am visitin family in Toronto! I think it is really neat how you can order your food over an ipad and you can see a picture of exactly what you are getting. The staff are very friendly. 

The only thing is that the price is kind of high. However, they do have an amazing selection and variety of sushi options. 

Everytime I eat something here, I always have an amazing experience! They are good for groups of people and families with small children. They are clean and the food comes out pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"They support ipad ordering services here with tonnes of hot and cold dishes. In the front-middle area of the vicinity, there's a soup and salad island, and to the front of that on the left side there's room for dessert - ice cream more specifically. The service is pretty good and consistent - you're never waiting too long for an order and none of ours went missing. They also come by to refill your water if that's what you ordered and the ambiance is pretty loud - considering there's a range of ethnic backgrounds and parties that populate this place. A sure win if you were to consider."}
{"text":"Excellent quality sushi for the price. I wouldn't go for dinner as it's super expensive-but lunch is very reasonable-$14.95 per person for AYCE. Different menu items available for dinner (Philadelphia roll which is my FAVOURITE only available at dinner). Ambiance is great. Good service and it's a great place to go if your friends don't like sushi per se-Chinese, Korean and Thai food items also offered which is great. Salad and dessert buffet included. You can get full fast, so pace yourself!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with the family and a buncha family friends. Was delighted with the whole iPad ordering service which has become the staple for so many sushi/Japanese restaurants these days, and rightly so based on the sheer convenience of it. Additionally, I like that they still integrate an in person hospitality component in the service with actual waiters still assigned to tables. 

Apart from the service, the food received a bit of a mixed reaction from us. The spicy tuna and the California rolls that we had were some of the freshest and most delicious pieces of sushi we've ever had but then the chicken teriyaki and other Japanese culinary dishes we had were sub-standard and the quantity was a bit underwhelming.

The desserts were pretty decent too and all in all it was a pretty 3 star experience for us. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was because we were sitting near the food  prep area or better staff that night but service was excellent.  Empty plates were taken away promptly , refills without asking and extra napkins. The food was abundant, very good and came quickly. 
Love the iPad ordering system with pictures."}
{"text":"never disappointed with this place. The Ipad ordering system is awesome and the food comes out very fast! love it!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for one of my friends birthdays and for a few sushi dinners throughout the year. However, I don't really love this restaurant. 

CONS
- The sushi is not always fresh
- Everyone at the table has to order off of the same menu (if one person wants a la carte and the other people want AYCE, everyone has to order off of the same menu
- Employees \"forget\" or bring you less of the pricier items ordered off of the AYCE menu
- The restaurant doesn't carry gluten free soya sauce
- The dinner menu has a small selection of sashimi to choose from making a $40 AYCE meal kind of boring if that is the only thing you can eat due to food allergies

PROS:
- Quick service
- They have a dairy free dessert option
- They have a loyalty card where you earn credit towards a future meal
- They can accommodate large groups

All over, this is not my first choice in Thornhill but if I ever needed a restaurant to accommodate 30 plus people in Thornhill, I might consider it."}
{"text":"I love coming here! I've been here over 10 times now and the sushi is fresh and they've made it so easy to order off of the Ipad. However, you must go to tge tge salad bar yourself if you would like to get soups, salad and other desserts.
Overall, Staffs are friendly and the environment is relaxing and clean. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The variety for lunch was very poor. Just few options of general types of rolls, no signature or special rolls. They serve a lot of mango salad though.

Generally speaking it was just OK, not that surprising."}
{"text":"Depending on your server and where you are seated in the restaurant the service varies greatly. Some nights this is a four star restaurant others... much like my experience tonight it was terrible. The avocado in our rolls was horrendously over ripened almost to the point it where it was going bad. I was once a regular customer but I'm not sure I'll be coming back. When we told the server that the avocado was bad she tried to tell us everything was \"fresh\" when it clearly was not. More over, our orders went to the wrong table and the when we asked after trying for 30 mins to flag down the server she didn't seem to care too much. A huge overpriced disappointment is how I'm feeling right now."}
{"text":"Been going here whenever I feel like having ayce sushi. It's a bit more on the pricier side but I never had a complaint about the quality of their food. Drinks not included...but tea is! :) you order off the iPad.  Would recommend making reservations for weekend dinner."}
{"text":"Food: Good choice of sashimi for dinner, but I feel like rolls were missing. A lot of chinese dishes. Ramen was good. No eel rice which my family enjoys.
Decor: A little dark for a restaurant where you need to use electronic device to order (ipad). Not too good for the eyes."}
{"text":"3.5
Not bad! Beautifully decorated, and I loved the fact that desserts were laid out buffet-style for you to take as you pleased. Apps available at the buffet as well, but they were mostly salads (I came for the high-carb, crunchy rolls!)

I think the selection was fair and diverse for a lunch menu, although I wish they might've had a few more special rolls beyond the typical dynamite or dragon on the menu (to be fair, I guess that's why the AYCE dinner is an extra $12ish). 

When I came here with some friends last week, I found the sushi to be just as you might expect from AYCE - not bad at all, but not outstanding. What I didn't enjoy was the very, very slow speed of service - I came at a time where there were empty tables aplenty (Thursday lunch) and felt that food took much longer to arrive than other AYCEs I've been to, even during the mealtime rush! Maybe not as tasty as nearby Genji sushi, but DEFINITELY better value than you'll find there (I was not ready to eat again until lunch the next day - $20 post-tips and tax well-spent)."}
{"text":"Definetely worth a visit! The food was so fresh and flavourful. The server were nice and quick! My favourite is the shrimp tempura.."}
{"text":"Really good and fresh sashimi! Their food is like most other AYCE buffets but they're pretty expensive... I do enjoy their ipad ordering system though."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight for my brother in laws birthday, we had been once before a year ago or so and enjoyed ourselves. Tonight's dinner was weird. The salad bar felt neglected, and random. Caesar salad next to Seaweed salad, next to potato salad , next to crab legs..  The menu itself is easy to order from, and we like the iPad system, although this evening it felt very robotic... our servers barely spoke to us, and it was tough to get a water refill or dishes cleared from the table.  There were also 4 birthdays during our time there, and the birthday song blasts through the speakers which is cute but a bit excessive. The food quality wasn't what I remembered it to be in the past. The sushi was very bland, but some dishes like the OK Chicken, and shrimp tempura we're tasty. I don't know that I'd return, it's just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the snow crab legs there are definitely amazing. The use of ipads for ordering is quite convenient and lets you keep your dinners more private and you don't feel the inconvenience of having to signal a waiter/waitress every time you want to order. A bit pricey so it's best for special days or events."}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE sushi in the GTA! Food and selection here is awesome! I could honestly say that I've received the best service here than any other establishment  ever. Especially from Andy. The restaurant has a nice look and vibe to it. A nice place to bring a date or your family. If your a sashimi lover like me, you will notice the freshness of their fish. I was surprised at how nice the food presentation is that comes on your plate. Especially for a AYCE restaurant. I highly recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a Vegas establishment. How it's set up, the decor, etc. Very Vegasesque. Anyways for an AYCE I was very impressed. They have a ridiculous amount of options and the entire menu is on iPads! Very cool. You just touch what you want to order and hit send and then they come by with your food. Nice. Very trendy. 

I'd say stick with the sushi, we tried their pad thai which was awful. The salmon rose was good, as was most of the sushi. Green tea and mango ice cream are good, as was the service. Surprisingly quick and efficient. I'd come back.

P.S. their shrimp tempura was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Amazing all u can eat sushi but wish the staff was little nicer otherwise it's amazing"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and I'm not impressed.  The food wasn't that great and the customer service wasn't outstanding although delivering food to our table was at a decent pace with a few wrong orders.  I don't care if a place has an ipad or not, the food and service has to be good. Overall, I prefer Kiku over 168 because of the quality and selection of food.  Parking can also be annoying during high peak hours. 

- Salmon didn't seem fresh. I could tell by the texture and it just looked like its been refrigerated for a while.
- Ribs were full of fat and chewy. The taste of it didn't seem right.
- Calamari was battered poorly.
- Not very many dessert selection.
- Our waiter gave us a few incorrect orders which belonged to the table across.  While the other table received incorrect orders that belonged to ours.
- Prices were average.
- They have a small open salad/soup bar which is okay. Lettuce was overdressed with sauce. Soup areas were messy and poorly presented."}
{"text":"I come here with my family all the time for maybe 3 years now. there prices have increased A LOT since 2010. Dinner use to be $24.95 and stand currently at $28.95 There prices for children are $10.95 which is about $2 more than other AYCE places. To be honest my kids dont even eat what its worth at $15.95!! 

The food is ok. I use to like it alot. Its all very tasty. 

Con: No debit. Credit/cash only which is kinda inconvience. 

- Pretty pricey for what it is

For a family of 4 will ring you up about $90.00"}
{"text":"Abover average Ayce sushi. The ipads allow you to order at your leisure and there's a good selection to choose from. Prices are also a bit higher than standard AYCE but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The restaurant in general looks more like a hangout place for mid to late twenties at a bar. It may have been the dim lighting or the pink lamp things high up in the ceiling.

I went for dinner and their menu included Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Viet food.
For dinner, they have an extra ordering sheet that you fill out and they include special rolls,food and sashimi.
Their sashimi were just average,their rolls were just ok,their udon soup tasted like vegetable broth and their bbq short ribs were cut really thick (which I don't mind). Their special rolls are worth trying and they come in 2-4 pcs so why not?

It got quite cold halfway through the dinner even though we were sitting far away from the door.Weird.

At one point,the servers got our orders mixed up with another table and we ended up with ginger roll and some crunchy salmon roll.The ginger roll came just with ginger and it was unbearable.(maybe it's cuz I'm not a fan of ginger..hm)

Conclusion: The servers were nice enough,washroom was clean and plenty of parking space available in the plaza,lots of choices when it comes to food,but I don't think it was worth it for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing selection and all you can eat ( cold ) crab legs!! Amazing. Two people with tax came out to $74:) Saturday night."}
{"text":"Not usually one for buffets, but my in laws love Mandarin, and any way that I can sway them otherwise is a win for me. 

We came here on a Sunday night with reservation and the place was already full of diners. 

You get to order off an ipad, with photos. There is also a cold salad bar with soup (4 kinds) and crab legs on weekends. Although you can order whatever you want, it comes out FAST and if you don't space this out, you'll be getting a table full of food before you've worked through you first crab leg. It came out FAST!

Food quality was not bad. Everything was saucy. and no options for vegetables really. But what we got was good. Sashimi, and rolls were yummy. They have salmon belly and salmon head. Also Kalbi, bulgolgi and spicy rice cakces. Some thai dishes as well. And some soup noodle dishes. For dessert, there was make your own shaved ice, ice cream and deep fried milk pudding you had to order off the menu. 

It would have been better if the servers could clear plates without asking, as they piled up quickly. But when you did call them over, they were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Don't let the ordering by iPad gimmick fool you...food quality is mediocre, and my impression is that you get less variety of hot food to choose from than other AYCE"}
{"text":"3.5 rating.

This is my first time here for ayce sushi. I typically go to ayce in Markham. We came here for lunch and noticed it was already busy. One cool thing about this ayce spot is that you're given a iPad to order. We ordered quite a lot of dishes but unfortunately no sashimi..maybe because it was lunch time. The food itself was good but not spectacular, and there was a dessert table too which was awesome! I only enjoyed the mango pudding though. And out of their ice cream I only liked the green tea. The strawberry and chocolate tasted weird to me.

Overall, great place..food comes out fast, the servers are quick and efficient. And for once I don't need to go all the way to Markham."}
{"text":"Fanciest AYCE I have ever been to!

Make your selections on an ipad and wait for your items to be served. Here are few items that I can recommend:

Salmon roses: Slippery but tasty. Less rice, more meat.
Kalbi: So delicious! no limit on Kalbi here!
Rainbow maki: Insta-gourmet: Just add Salmon and avocado!
Crispy O.K. chicken: a misnomer, this chicken is tasty, not just OK!

But wait. There's more! They got an open bar for soups, salads, sweets, and ice cream.

Place is huge, perfect for groups. Quick and accurate service. Prices are slightly higher than the usual AYCE, but considering the quality, variety, the service and the fancy decor I wouldn't mind paying few extra dollars."}
{"text":"Awful service, waiter was angry when I asked for more wasabi, asked for water that never came. More than half the things I ordered never came, do not recommend coming here with more than 2 people unless you want to wait 40 minutes for your food"}
{"text":"Review experience is from a friday dinner
Strong points that set this place apart from other AYCE jap:
- crab legs on a friday night
- have a salad bar, dessert table, icecream, soup, crab legs at the self serve area, love this idea!
- no missed dishes
- friendly waitress, but don't expect high end service..good compares to other places
- dishes came fast and all at once, though i found it a bit too fast compares to other ayce.. so do adjust your ordering style accordingly. 
- excellent variety, e.g. torched tuna and salmon sushi, shrimp sashimi, cooked salmon belly, cantonese noodles
- first time seeing shaved ice station!
- free for 2 year old and my 4 year old was only $5, much more reasonable than some other ayce i have seen!
- ipad ordering makes it easy with photos available

Things I would like to see
- fruit dishes at the bar, especially since the price we we are paying is similar to Mandarin, or dragon legend, dragom pearl, all of which offer fruits
- dishes portion too big.. a noodle dish would be enough for a meal portion on its o
- thai basil shrimp was super spicy.. but menu didn't say state spicy.  I was expecting mostly sour sweet with a touch of spice, but nope, no one could eat it at our table

Overall
This place wins on the point of the crab legs...
Without the crab legs, definitely just another ayce that"}
{"text":"Great place for AYCE and a reasonable price for weekday. I came by noon on a Tuesday and the place was PACKED. The ambience and restaurant is really pretty. The food came really quick despite the lunch rush which caught me by surprise. Sushi was nothing special but still tasty. I recommend the grilled salmon teriyaki, I had like 5 slices!"}
{"text":"Nice decor. Service started off really good then dwindled.   Small salad bar with a few items was ok as a throw in.   Good sushi.  Hot dishes were just ok.  Basil beef was good.  Seafood Cantonese chow mien was really gooey , wasn't good.  All the rest was pretty good. Reasonable drink prices.  Staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Lots of variety and fast service but food was greasy and mediocre. iPad ordering system was very neat. A larger party might be tricky to order for because food items that were ordered in multiple quantities came out in one plate. Expect to wait on a Saturday night, and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Accommodates large parties! Quick service and accurate too.  Order from iPad. Lunch is very cheap but no sashimi @ lunch."}
{"text":"The idea of this restaurant is very cool using iPads to order your food, the way of the future. But this does raise some concerns for me. Multiple people in a single day use the same iPad while they eat and have there fingers in there mouth and possibly being sick. This means that germs can be passed really easily. The quality of the food is alright but its not the best asian buffet that I've ever had. The options to choose from are good but the quality does not stand to par. The price of the food is also way to expensive for what you are getting and 100% not with it. The service was disgusting how bad it was. It really was a disappointment. I do not recommend you visit this place if you want good quality asian food and sushi."}
{"text":"Considering I'm about to go into a food coma in 3 minutes I thought I'd write a review first.
I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.
My son just discovered sashimi and even though he's only 10 he can put back 20 pieces easily. At least for the next 3 months he'll only cost me the $13.95 kids price!! But even at the adult $27.95 rate this place is well worth it. Salmon sashimi, Kalbi, Shrimp Tempura and Snow Crab... Need I say more??
Update... My stomach is f*****d , I just don't think I'm an AYCE type of guy.."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite AYCE sushi place and I'm giving it four stars because as far as those places go, this is one of the best in my opinion. The iPad menu makes ordering and reordering a breeze. The salad/desert bar is the best idea they had and I wish more AYCE Sushis would follow their lead, because you can start eating right away, which makes waiting a lot more bearable than when you're just sipping on your drink.

The sushis are excellent for an AYCE place. They taste fresh and hold well. The fruit roll is a delight of freshness and sweetness and their salmon belly is succulent. The menu is varied, which means that even people who really don't like Japanese food can find something to suit them (as long as they're not completely averse to Asian cuisine). 

The price is a little higher than most AYCE Sushi (a few dollars). It feels industrial and impersonal. The meat comes before the rice, which doesn't make any sense, and the food is sometimes slow to get out. But keep in mind that this is an AYCE. We're not asking to have the same relationship with the staff as with the Japanese chef in Kill Bill. We're asking for plenty of good food and a reasonable execution, which is exactly what you get."}
{"text":"It was like the buffet you could find in a (3 stars) \"all inclusive resort\".

Some yelpers are pretty good taking pictures; they made me imagine a fancy-futuristic ambiance. I thought it was going to be decorated like a spaceship. Far away from the cool space purple lights, I found the place kind of awkward. 

We were seated in a big room at the end of the establishment where other 100 gluttonous anonymous were congregated. The noise level was wedding style. I couldn't stop imagining that a waiter would give balloons to the ppl on the buffet queue.   

Once the iPad is on your possession, don't hesitate, touch everything you consider flirty. 

The service was really fast; the first dishes came in less than 5 minutes, followed by the rest in short intervals. No dirty plates were on the table for more than 2 minutes!

Although I was surprised by the velocity and accuracy of the servers, I got concerned about their facial expressions. They looked tired, kind of nervous, almost robotic; maybe they don't have enough time to relax or breath...

The quality of the ingredients was average. From all the items we ordered, here are my favorites: Grilled calamari, grilled tuna, beef tataki, shrimp skewers, and shrimp dumplings. The salmon was ok, plus they had octopus and fish eggs sushi.

They need to improve the \"Asian Buffet\" part because you can find most of the dishes in a regular sushi restaurant. The wow factor belongs to the (frozen) king crab legs, and to the fact that they didn't set the 2 hours limit (cool for the lady who was trying to convince her daughter to go for her 3rd dessert... lmsao)."}
{"text":"There was a deal for this on teambuy yesterday and I purchased two since I had driven by this place a few times and also heard good things from my brother. After buying the teambuy deal, I realized that the deal would not be available for use until 24hours after but decided to go anyway as I was craving sushi. 

This sushi place is ok. The decor is pretty, decent size, and overall pleasant ambiance. The menu boasts an abundant variety of foods ranging from japan, chinese, and korean.  

Overall experience was ok. Service was nice and fast. After ordering checklist style, food came out within 5-10mins. Salmon sashimi was pretty good. Other sushi was ok, not bad but not amazing. Same goes for the cooked stuff. They have a side salad bar and 1/3 of it was shared with desserts. 

If i hadn't bought the teambuy, I dont think i would come back as there are many  better sushi places to go to. I bought 2 so I think i will come back one more time and give the other one away."}
{"text":"Horrible! The worse service we have ever witnessed! And full of lies.
We called in a few days ago trying to confirm that it would be safe for me to eat here, as I am gluten free, and take my allergy seriously. We have gathered here for my friends birthday, and I was made a complete ass off in front of everyone! Although the I was re assured over the phone days ago they will cater to my allergy, also once I came inn the waiters have ALL been notified including the 'manager' angel,  I had specifically requested I put inn my order severally in paper, I also made a note about gluten free on it and what to avoid! 
I later got 2 hand rolls and soup with noodle... Which is a big Nono and grilled zucchini... They kept bringing people's orders dropping them in the table and tuning off!
No one knowing what's what!
I tried explaining to the manager everything that happened, at my table she basically started roing her eyes and saying I should sit at a different table, I reassured her I am fine with my friends and would only like my food to be brought to ME... And that if all I can eat is literally 1 hand roll, then it would be morally wrong to charge us a full all u can eat dinner price! She later said she will charge me for my 2 hand rolls and vegetables... Which I refused to eat... After more embarrassing back and forth at the table, and unprofessional attitude, we finally all convicted her that my bill should be free!
Over all I was so embarrassed And taken advantage of, lied too just to get us here to eat, although they are not catering to those with legitimate allergies but claim to on the phone! Very rude unprofessional and disrespectful!
Above all else this place is dirty."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place and I liked it so much. The last time I went was the worst experience of sushi all you can eat for me. The rolls were not fresh at all, the portions were very small that we needed to order on and on. The meat smells so bad that I could not even eat. Definitely won't go there again."}
{"text":"I don't like 168 sushi.

Not to say it's bad, it's just not for me. I've been there three times so far and every time, nothing there stands out. Ipad menus, redundant food options, lack of creativity, self serve appetizer/desert bar are a few words I'd describe this place. 

I go to a sushi buffet to eat sushi (otherwise I'd go to Mandarin).I didn't like the sushi because it was very underwhelming. The proportion of rice to fillings were off - there was just too much rice. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in terms of taste and authenticity of sushi.

The decor is nice, and the establishment is clean. I find 168 similar to durian.

 You either love it or hate it."}
{"text":"Great selection. Great quality sushi. 
The only annoying thing is that the ice cream scoops are soaking in boiling water so when you go to scoop your ice cream it melts..."}
{"text":"My experience 

Pro
- Good service food was fast
- you can order off an iPad

Con
- don't like the seating situation, especially when packed 
- wasn't a big fan of their desserts"}
{"text":"Slow service.. whatever you order they will give you the wrong dish or it comes out later on when your on your third order my son and I didn't enjoy it so 30mins into being there and getting lucky to eat something we left.. and seeing my bill they were going to charge my 4 year old child for an adult.. never coming back"}
{"text":"Might have given me food poisoning.  So automatic downgrade to one star.  The concept is pretty neat.  Almost like dim sum for sushi and other Japanese and Asian cuisine that you order from an iPad.  However, the portions are not very fresh for some dishes.  The kalbi for example was cold as was the basil beef when it came out and the nigiri sushi was tiny and the ramen was also not impressive.  The tempura shrimp was pretty good and a large portion but other than that the meal was 2 star at best before the aforementioned possible food poisoning."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5 - 4.0 star rating.  I enjoyed the overall experience at this AYCE restaurant and it was pleasant even with a party of 12.  There are some things here that I think make it stand out a little bit from the rest of the AYCE sushi scene.

1. The tablet ordering system works tremendously well.  You just scroll, tap on the items that you want, read the descriptions so you know what you're getting, and see your order history.

2. The help-yourself salad bar that offers 4 types of soups (wonton, hot & sour, miso, and clam chowder), 6 types of salads (potato, seaweed, mango, mushroom, etc), a few types of desserts, and the snow crab legs.  I like this idea and it probably helps to streamline service quite a bit.

3. The service staff are very attentive clearing plates from our tables as the food does come quite quickly out of the kitchen.  This part was really welcome as the room at the table was a premium and we were just staking plates on plates on plates.  The hot food items come out much quicker than the sushi so order some of those as a buffer until the sushi arrives.

4. The rolls are done right with lots of filling and less rice.  They don't try to fill you up with thick layers of rice.  The nigiri portions were also the slim on the rice and a nice cut of fish.

5. I really recommend that they lose the tuna cream cheese roll because why eat canned tuna with cream cheese wrapped in rice  Also, please drop the spicy tuna on a pringles chip item, our table ordered it for the novelty factor and it just doesn't work.  The chip is just soggy while the fish sits on top.  I wouldn't count this as an innovative AYCE menu item.

6. Aside from those two niggles, the food offerings and experience was fairly satisfying and I left carrying a food baby."}
{"text":"Very Nice place with good service. For a buffet the food is excellent. I recommand this place."}
{"text":"Fairly standard yet good AYCE sushi. Ordering from an iPad is a nice gimmick. Everything we ordered (sashimi, sushi, etc.) was good, but nothing stood out as being exceptional. I would return here, because it's an AYCE sushi place near where I live, but I wouldn't necessarily make an excursion specifically to eat here."}
{"text":"This being my second all you can eat sushi so I can now compare.  I was suprised that drinks were not included as part of the special, but they had them listed on the iPad for some reason.  

Service was okay, they were a little bit slow and it seemed a little disoriented with peo0le always walking about.  

Sushi was okay but the cooked items lacked any real flavour or imagination. A bit pricey and I'm sure there are many out there who can offer better.  

They seemed the nicest when you were paying the bill..  fishing for tip much?"}
{"text":"This place is only unique for their iPad ordering system, which is that, unique. The food isn't anything special, if anything i don't really like how it tastes. The sushi has this sort of citrusy taste that makes me feel ill. Been here twice, once last year and once this year assuming thief changed something, but they didn't so i still don't like it. I will not be returning unfortunately. There are places that cost less that taste so much better."}
{"text":"*UPDATE*

It's been two days and I can't stop thinking about the Shrimp with Maggi Sauce.

I'm sweating. I'm flustered. I'm skittish. I'm in love. 

I'm pretty sure I woke up from an erotic dream involving these shrimps today.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


My friend's co-worker told her about this place, so she calls me up when I'm on my way home and we go.

I had seen this place a few times when I was on the the Viva but it never really intrigued me.

But it was awesome!

The decor was nice, it was fancy enough for the area. 

We were seated in a half booth/bench sort of seating. It was cool. 

We started off with the salad bar. I found it was your typical mandarin-style salad bar with the regular salads (shrimp, seafood, pasta, potato, chicken, broccoli, ambrosia, etc) that I find doesn't really go with asian food, but whatev's. It's the regular/norm.

But then we hit the tickets. (The ordering system where you check off what you want on a ticket). 

Before I get into the food, I have to mention how fast the service was!! It was crazy. We didnt go 30 seconds without food on our table from the moment we came back from the salad bar. 

Here were the hi-lites:

1. The SASHIMI was awesome. Especially the surf clam.

2. The Mango Spring Roll was disgusting. Please don't order this.

3. The Highlight of the meal was definitely the dish we ordered on a whim.. The Shrimp with Maggi Sauce. It was amazing. HUGE jumbo shrimp perfectly deep fried with a special sauce and diced peppers and onions. It was amazing. 

Jamie Oliver says that you can tell how someone feels about you by the size of the shrimp they serve you...and clearly they loved us!

4. Their Maki Rolls were awesome! My favs were the Vaughn Roll, the Rock Roll and the Pink Lady Roll. 

5. Desert!  They have the standard fare of desert by the salad bar (Green Tea, Mango, Vanilla, Chocolate and Red Bean ice cream) but if you looked closely at your place mat...you'll notice that there's 2 secret items listed there!

5 a) The Deep Fried Banana - we actually got this by mistake. I think the waitress thought I ordered this when I meant to order the other secret item. But I'm glad she brought it over! It was amazing. Large chunks of banana deep fried with a crispy shell and drizzled in maple syrup. A must try!

5b) THe Deep Fried Milky Rice Pudding - this is what I meant to order when she brought over the banana, but I ordered it again anyways, because I was really curious! IT was good, a little different texture wise. But it was delicious. it was really gelatinous, but crispy on the outside. It was amazing. Kinda like a deep fried Jello-ish desert. I know it sounds weird, but it was awesome.


The Verdict - I'd def come here again.

Only side note : Thes only cash/credit even though the have a debit machine. It looks like they just dont want to use it. 

Cost : 30 with tip (buffet only. no drinks)"}
{"text":"Expensive for AYCE. 

It's absolutely worth the price for dinner on a weekday, due to their huge selection, decent service and the quality of the sushi ($27). It goes up rather steeply to $29 on fri-sun which is a bit more borderline, but still worth it if you're sufficiently hungry. They don't skimp on the 'good' ingredients which helps justify the price, which is a bit higher than the norm in the area. I wouldn't necessarily bother with lunch though as many of their more interesting rolls aren't available. Gets a bit noisy, but the location isn't too bad: the self-serve salad, soup and ice-cream bar is a nice touch as well."}
{"text":"Uhm, yeah, no.

The interior is nice, the tablets for ordering food seem to be a staple in AYCE places nowadays, the salad bar is sad, and the place is, well, an AYCE place.

The quality of the ingredients is low, and I can feel it after a few bites - when you get a dry mouth from eating salmon, you know it is of low quality.

I have to warn you, loyal readers, that I'm picky with my sushi - my colleagues love 168, and don't understand why am I thumbing my nose at it - they are lucky, in a sense, that they couldn't taste the difference.

So, AYCE, in the most classic fashion. If you like AYCE - go for it. If you don't - don't bother."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible just horrible.

Worst service ever. Everytime we asked about our food waitress just says its coming its coming. She looks impatient and pissed off. 

Food was meh. Sashimi takes forever to come and they make sure to serve you all the cheap cooked food first prior to giving you any sashimi and sushi. 

I will never visit again. Waitress bumped into me like 5 times when she's collecting her dishes. There's no service."}
{"text":"MAMA, I'M IN LOVE. I'M IN LOVE AND I WILL SHOUT IT TO THE WORLD! 

Bae look me here for Valentine's Day because I requested AYCE sushi. (I only have it once or twice a year on account of preventing deathly food comas) I walked in and was surprised at how huge the venue was! It looks so dingy from the outside. What also pleasantly surprised me was the fact that all the tables and booths were so spaced out and the tables were HUGE, even for a table of two. (I don't need nobody witnessing me pigging out like its the last day I'll ever eat, ok) 

There were so many people but their organization was spectacular. They had 2-3 hostesses set up for the holiday dinner, which made retrieving people so much easier. One thing I like a lot is the fact that they don't overbook or serve tables with wishful thinking that they're going to leave before the actual people that reserved it arrive. (So common in many AYCE places). In fact, I spotted many empty tables that waited for their rightful diners as I sat down. 

iPad ordering is my favourite and it was flawless other than the fact that 1 or 2 dishes were missed. My favourite things of the night:
- snow crab legs at the buffet table (wtf?! So awesome) 
- black snow roll (it's a Vietnamese style roll with fresh fatty salmon sashimi and avocado in rice paper omg); so good that it's not all carbs
- fruit roll (Vietnamese style roll with banana, mango and peach in rice paper drenched in a mango sauce), it was the perfect dessert 
- kalbi (WHAT? It was Korean style, the same kind you get at Korean places for $19-$23 for 2 big pieces). Unlimited fatty kalbi brought out the carnivore in me. 
- beef tataki (although very small, the taste was distinct and delicious) 
- salmon sashimi (v. Fresh and soft. Pls fatten all the salmon up so I can eat them all) 

I don't think anything I tried was 'bad'

Service was also amazing and everything came out at the speed of the flash. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the fact that it seemed like every asian in the restaurant was extremely impolite to others in the restaurant or even to the servers. There were so many of them and they were loud and inconsiderate. They weren't all related but they sure all acted the same. I was even budded by a 300lb Filipino man that was definitely older than me for ice cream on the grounds that his dad was in the line ahead of me. (That shitty excuse only works when you're under 10....) Not sure if this is the crowd every night but it sure turned me off from going to the buffet table. 

100% would come back again when I feel like overachieving the deadly sin I am overly guilty of - gluttony."}
{"text":"WORST. SUSHI. EVER. Would give this place 0 stars if I could, are you kidding me? maki rolls were a mess, sashimi was warm, in fact most of the fish was warm. what the hell are they doing? I've been to many AYCE sushi places and this is by far the worse, and I'm asian so I know my sushi. I should've known by disenchanted looks on the sushi \"chefs\" faces as they pumped out the food....AVOID, you've been warned!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go to if you're feeling antisocial and don't give af about what you're wearing. The iPads that they use for ordering is perfect for seeing the types of food that you want and for avoiding having to speak to the servers if you feel awkward about ordering. The food as a whole is good - the portions are rather small but nonetheless, there is a wide variety to choose from and everything is well-prepared and tasty."}
{"text":"Ample parking spots for a Sunday lunch

Open bar salad and soup area clean and with a good variety 

Avoided the desserts of cakes, ice cream but had to try their shaved ice + good stuffs as toppings like red bean and various jellies and sweet toppings. 

Buffet food ordering via iPad was very convenient. Wide variety!

Loved the following:
- kalbi, different teriyakis, salmon rose roll, green dragon roll (avocado), tofu, dumplings, miso soup

Do get a bit of everything you like. I avoided rice and noodles/udon as these either make me full rather quickly or bloat me up. 

Overall, it was a very good experience. Similar to Heart Sushi in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Have become a regular customer. We go there 2 or 3 times a month. There service is exact and great. The sashimi is fresh, and the beef tataki is outstanding. There is one new dish that deserves praise: wasabi vanilla shrimps. They are excellent. The same sauce is also used on Okra, and that is also delicious."}
{"text":"168 Sushi if the place you go when you want a quality All-You-Can-Eat Sushi place.

The absolute best part about 168 Sushi is the iPad ordering system. Bottomless drinks and a huge selection of sushi/Chinese/Thai food on the menu

Every table gets an iPad with a graphical menu showing you the exact picture of the item on the menu.  You actually get to see what the sushi roll looks like before ordering.

To order, you simply click on each item and it sends the order request to the sushi bar.

Moments later, they are bringing you the items you ordered.

Very Cool....

Another good thing about 168 Sushi is the mini-Buffet that is included.  From Soup to a small salad bar, this fills the appetite while waiting for your sushi to arrive.

Also, the d√©cor looks like a neon 90's nightclub.

Good job 168 Sushi!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Very overpriced. And below average sushi. Yikes.. there are so many better sushi places in the area. Those three phrases sum up this place"}
{"text":"Lunch time weekend special was 15.99 all you can eat. 

Pros:
Salad bar that also includes 4 different types of soups such as wonton & hot and sour. Fresh seaweed salad. Service is fast and the place was packed. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table when we arrived at 2pm. 

Cons: 
Sushi rolls could be better. The quality of the fish is not of the highest standard in my opinion.
Limited amount of dessert which is actually at the salad bar. You would expect more from all you can eat. 

Giving this place 3 stars as limited dessert options and the sushi rolls could have been better."}

Weekday lunch
No wait

Came here with a friend for a casual lunch. It was a bit underwhelming and the atmosphere was a bit awkward (not sure what they are trying to accomplish with the offensively ostentatious purple neon lighting). It's as if they are trying to give a hipper feel, except that the neighborhood is mostly families and even the York U. students are a good distance off. The restaurant had a good number of patrons but was far from full.

They use the iPad ordering system which seems to be more popular with some of these AYCE places. Service was quick and impersonal (as expected) but efficient. The salad bar was in a bit of an unappetizing state and the dessert bar was limited.

Food quality was ok, but not stellar even factoring in that this was an AYCE sushi restaurant. There are better options not too far away."}
{"text":"This place deserves nothing less than 5 stars. I am not ashamed to say that I have been to almost every single AYCE sushi place in between Richmond Hill and North York and 168 SUSHI takes the rice crown. I heard about it through a flyer that accidentally fell into my hands in the mail room. It looked too good to be true - Thai, Korean AND Japanese?? But it is true. 

168 Sushi took the place of a really sketchy Chinese buffet that used to be on that same corner for a couple of years. It's in the same plaza as value Village, hard to miss. The d√©cor is very nice, dimly lit with a lot of hour-glass shaped decorations everywhere. There are a couple of separated eating areas, all around the restaurant there are a lot of booths, in the middle and in the back area just tables and couches. Whatever you do, CHOOSE A BIG TABLE!!! The food comes out instantaneously and all at once...last time I was there I had nowhere to put the shrimp tempura except for on top of the soya sauce bottle.

I haven't had any of the drinks or cocktails at 168 but the pictures look pretty good? I always get water, more space for le sush!

There is a salad bad, it has soups - my favorites are corn mixed with hot & sour, salads (including wakame, shrimp, chicken and caesar), and ice cream/deserts. 
The menu for lunch way smaller than the dinner menu but the price difference warrants it. Dinner is $26 and lunch is $14. However, there are a lot more options at dinner. Go for dinner if you want to try all the additional \"from the wok\" seafood, sashimi and the special sushi rolls. 

The sushi rolls are delicious and fresh with very little rice, even though they fly out of the kitchen at the speed of light. At dinner they have some special options like the pink lady roll which comes in rice paper as opposed to just rice. 
From the wok is the best thing about dinner - the dishes here are not big at all so you can actually try a little bit of everything. The SHRIMP WITH MAGGI SAUCE is magnificent. It's HUGE and crispy and just to die for. I'm also a big fan of the Thai basil beef and Thai basil chicken; you can really taste the basil. Another favorite is Korean stir fried glass noodles (I'm a huge noodle fan. Yeah, I said it!)
Sashimi here is also just WHOA, together with the salmon roses. So fresh, it just melts in your mouth.

I have been a die-hard fan of Hockey sushi for as long as I can remember, and I almost cried which I cheated on it with 168. The string had to be cut...I now have extremely high standards for my AYCE sushi, which probably means I'm going to off myself if this place ever closes. IF I CAN'T EAT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS - NO ONE CAN!!"}
{"text":"Been here ever since its grand opening and the place has upgraded from paper menus to iPads (yay to the way of the future!).  Their sashimi is fresh and their sushi is not too big in size, meaning that you won't get full too quickly.  As per all AYCE sushi restaurants, the dinner menu is better and has more choices.  One of my favourite places to go for sushi :)"}
{"text":"I already gave this place 4 stars but since they got their iPad ordering system, I'm bumping it up to 5 stars. It's amazing how quickly  your food comes out with the iPad system."}
{"text":"I like it. Specially the variety and easy to find Ipad Menu. Their sushi are all fresh, that;s the thing I like, however honestly one year ago their quality was much better than now, but I still go there."}
{"text":"In my latest visit on Sunday, I found that the restaurant was very busy; however, the kitchen items were not quite as good as they had been when it first opened. I believe that the head chef is a bit distracted as gossip indicates that he is involved in the planning for a new restaurant. It is still quite good and well worth dining there. The relatively new Ipad menus are efficient and food comes out quickly even when they are busy. Since I do not want the kitchen items to get cold I tend to place one order and half way through my meal, I place a second order."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place through a quick yelp search. It is pretty decent place to go for AYCE sushi for reasonable prices. They have a small salad bar with soups. 
They have a wide selection on their menu, which is ordering through iPads. 
The service was good, and food came out early as well. The fish was fresh. 
They also have a wide dessert selection."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this sushi place many times ... I think it is. Very good sushi the sashimi specially are very fresh and tasty ...most of the other stuff are good specially the OK chicken ... The two main things I donot like about this place are the messo soup and the price they pricer than most other sushi places. But the place is very nice u can you bring a girl here with u."}
{"text":"Worst waitress I have ever seen in my whole life, went home and told my grandpa the story, he said \"worst waitress I have ever heard of in my whole life!\""}

Sushi is tasty but the rice fell apart on us but that's minor and not worth taking a star away.  The selection of kitchen items and sushi items was quite broad. 

Overall... very happy would return"}
{"text":"Good choices for buffet. I tried lots of chinese and Japanese dishes, veggies, crabs, meat, sushi, etc  and they all tasted fresh. I like the method of ordering via iPad. The desserts were yummy and of course, gotta have matcha ice cream!!! Nice staff, large space, a but expensive."}
{"text":"They got a cool new sign! Really nice place, though similar to other \"new style\" buffet places like Kaka AYCE and Sushi Legend. Attractive decor and good service, the food is good quality. You get to order from an tablet; the standout items are the torched sushi and galbi ribs. They're done just right. Be sure to ask for a reward card, so you can get a free dinner after you've eaten there 10 times."}
{"text":"Well priced. Fresh sashimi. Excellent noodle dishes (really has that fried wok flavor). Best ayce in the gta. And also well priced - Especially for the large variety."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this location. I went once last year and fell in love with the d√©cor and the manner in which food was presented. I had been looking for a reason to return and finally had a chance tonight.

This is the first time I've been to a restaurant that effectively uses iPad technology in the ordering process. You get large pictures of the various menu items and can easily customize your order. There is the small problem that only 1 or 2 people can look at the screen at a time so if you are looking to share items this can be challenging. Servers do come by and double check your order prior to processing it but with the new technology they can do it without disturbing you.

Items arrive very quickly (usually). Portions are reasonable and of course it's AYCE so it's never a problem to order more. I continue to love the soup/salad/dessert bar that you can go up to as often as you wish, definitely a perk of this place. They also had fresh crab legs; however, the one member of our group who had them had quite the challenge cracking them.

Most of the items we tried were very good and a few were 'meh'. I don't believe we had any that we absolutely hated but I can't remember. Servers were attentive; however, one member of our party did not appreciate the server who whisked away a dish right after the last piece of sushi had been removed (as in it was still en route to the mouth). But these all seem minor points for an overall positive experience.

I continue to believe that this place is a must-try for AYCE sushi fans.  The vibe is much more modern than traditional joints.  I will definitely be a returning customer next time I'm in the mood for AYCE."}
{"text":"Service food comes
Fast and they are polite the waitors always clears your empty plates quick!"}
{"text":"My favourite AYCE sushi place to frequent! The newly renovated restaurant makes it look modern and dark. The menu options are endless and you can order off a iPad, so convenient! This sushi restaurant is my second home, its first on the list when I'm craving sushi. I love how you can get your own ice cream, salad, and seaweed salads. The service is great too."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with my girlfriend.

The decor was nice with everything clean and relatively new.
Ordering using the Ipad was good as it allowed us to see each item as well as order whenever we wanted rather than having to mark the items on paper and give it to a waiter.

The food was ok but nothing I would describe as delicious or memorable.  
The fish were fresh and the tempura tasty.

I enjoyed the kalbi.

All in all, I would come again if I get the cravings for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Place is pretty spacious, really busy at the time we went which was around 7pm. Pretty decent salad bar, but not so much options for dessert.

The front staff is hella rude, kept staring at us as if they didn't want us there. But the waiters were nice, quick with the clean ups and overall we got pretty good service. But for the price? Not so much. 

Much prefer to go some place else."}
{"text":"I bought a Teambuy coupon for $25 for 2 people worth of all you can eat sushi at 168 Sushi. At first I was kind of wary about AYCE places bc the quality of the sushi are usually not very good. 

168 surprising was not bad at ALL! As a matter of fact it was terrific. Seriously.

1.) SELF-SERVE Salad Bar - I tend to stay away from that in a AYCE, but the salad bar really wasn't bad. It got fresh salad from seed weed salad to soups and lobsters. Did I say Lobsters?! YES! There's lobsters. Wow~ The soup was not bad either, but my only small complaint is their bowls (some of them doesn't look clean, so I grab the ones underneath them). 

2.) BUFFET TIME! SUSHI & SASHIMI - 3 Words. Fresh. Unlimited. Quality. Hands down, some of the best sushi I have ever had in an AYCE restaurant (and perhaps better than some regular places too). 

3.) DEEP FRIED ITEMS - Weak point of the menu. The deep fried items are not that great. AVOID the mango spring roll...and the Yam...big let down, but hey AYCE are cant be perfect. TRY the chips items though! 

4.) MEAT ITEMS - The chicken and beef teriyaki aren't bad, especially the chicken (usually chicken teriyaki are dry, but 168's chicken is quite juicy and tender). Good seasoning and the flavor from the sauce - I really like the strong black pepper taste of the beef teriyaki. 

5.) DESSERT - I have to agree with Karl R on this one. The ice cream was soft and did not have a FROSTY cover on the ice cream. Although short on selection, I am sure you will be pretty satisfy with the food that dessert will be secondary. I tried the green tea, vanilla and red bean. Green is the best~ 

THE VERDICT 
-PRICE - Its a bit more pricey ($25/per person for dinner) than some other AYCE sushi places, but I think its worth it if you're into AYCE 
-DATE SPOT - Nice urban/club-ish decor, young vibe. Can definitely satisfy your date if he/she is a hungry person or a picky eater. Booth spots available for seating for privacy. 
-REPEAT BUSINESS FROM COUPON USE - Although I had a good time with my family I don't see myself going back not because of the food, but simply I'm not an AYCE kind of guy. If you are WHAT are you waiting for? There's 6 locations to go!"}
{"text":"I have been to this particular location of 168 sushi at least 6 or 7 times in the last year, so I can confidently say there has been a steady and startling decline of service, food, and customer service. The last time I went was an experience that has made me never want to set foot in ANY of their other establishments. 

Our table had to send back three items  (the vegetarian pad Thai that that tasted awful, the general Tao which was deep fried or fried to a point it was rubbery and was not even warm, and calamari tempura that was deep fried rubber) and each time we received no apology, no explanation, or any sort of remorse you should receive from waitstaff under this situation.

As we sat there finishing up what what left of the food we could stomach, both me and my friend started to feel sick so we headed to the bathroom. (Note that it was around 9:30 and they closed at 10:30) As we approach the bathroom, I saw a gentleman with a mop and mop bucket but I did not see a sign for wet floor so as I got near the threshold my feet slipped from under me and I landed on my lower back and right elbow. My friend said she could hear the impact of my body hitting the floor.  Embarrassed and not waiting to see if I was hurt I got up and rushed to the bathroom. 

Once inside and calming down, I started to feel a pain on my right side from my lower back to my neck, and my elbow was bleeding from a scrape.

Once we returned to our table, still not feeling well, my other friend called for the manager to inform them of the incident and the poor quality of food. The manager literally walked away then came back and asked what had happened again. He ask if there was a wet floor sign and I said I didn't see one and my friend who had gone to the bathroom with me said it was more in the dinning room and the server who was mopping was standing in front of it.

Now I understand that there was a sign but 1) it was in the dining room not the hallway, and 2) it was still AN HOUR until closing and they were mopping a floor that become SERIOUSLY  slippery when wet when there were still customers inside. 

The managers way of trying to appease us was giving me a mere 8 dollars off my bill and to inform me to \"pay attention and look for a wet floor sign\" 

Their staff and management are not trained AT ALL on how to deal with customers.  They don't even speak to you.

Don't go to this location. Terrible service, subpar food, lousy customer management."}
{"text":"Not bad for an all you can eat sushi restaurant. The food is not the best but not the worse either. They have Japanese, Chinese and Thai good options but best to stick to the sushi. Their Thai and Chinese food isn't that great. Stay away from the dim sum, they're gross. The ambiance in the restaurant is pretty nice and the place is clean. Their ipad ordering system is neat too. You get to see pictures of the dishes before you order.

Also, if you're craving crab legs, go on a friday night."}
{"text":"Sushi is decent quality and ingredients are quite fresh. Cooked food is also excellent. There's a good variety of items not found in other AYCE Japanese restaurants, so that's definitely a plus. Self-serve wakame is kind of interesting. Desserts suck and are generic out-of-the-box things supplied to them and available at every other buffet. 

The iPad ordering system is nice for the photos/item descriptions, but I find it otherwise to be cumbersome and slower than dealing with a server. Service is generally quick and pleasant.

Price is slightly on the higher end and I'm a bit iffy whether the place is worth the premium over other AYCE Japanese places."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this restaurant last night and we find it is ok.

Basically, you ordered your dish from a tablet and the waiter or waitress bring the dish to you.

The portion is relatively small but you can order as many times as you like.  

For the food the taste and freshness  is 7 out of 10 and for the service it is 6.5 out of 10.

What we and a lot of people dish like is that when the next table left or anyone who left the table the waiter or waitress just took out the broom and broom that floor around the table.  So if you sit next to  the table you can see the dust coming up so it really turned you off from eating which resulted in unappetizing.  

Another thing is that people assume that they are brushing or rushing customers out of the restaurant.  As an Asian person, the worst thing you can do to your guess whom visiting your home for whatever reason, you do not take out a broom and start to clean your house.  It gives bad impression and I am so surprise they are not considering this as part of their Feng Shui.

So if they keep doing this and the bad service then they will lose customers for sure."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed.  Their computerized, do-it-yourself ordering system should guarantee accuracy, but it logged us off in the middle of a meal, and did not prevent them from bringing one item twice and not bringing another at all.  Selection is reasonably large; execution varies - fish items seemed much fresher than the seafood ones.   Salad and dessert bar is very limited.  Service sucked, with food slammed down on the table and feeble apologies for forgetting the item we eventually gave up on.  Decor is garish and resembles a cocktail lounge that might be attached to a bowling alley."}
{"text":"You Canadians don't know how good you got it with 168 sushi. 

I live in California and whenever I want to have all you can eat sushi I have to drive 15 miles to go pay an arm and a leg for poorly made sushi that falls apart as you eat it (just sushi no dessert, no meat, no soup, etc., edamame costs extra) and I have to place my order on a piece of paper that I have to wave in the air repeatedly for the slow slow waitress to pick up and then I have to wait eons for the chefs to prepare my order.

168 sushi has tons of sushi options, Chinese and Thai food, tons of meat, desserts, and other food options including a buffet with various soups. The quality of food is pretty decent, it's not the best but it's good quality for AYCE, The price is really affordable (~$18 for lunch?). Your service is extremely fast and your food is prepared extremely fast and you can order off a freaking iPad.

Downsides are probably that there are limited booths so you'll probably be packed in close to some other people. The food is OK, nothing spectacular, nothing gross, just whatever you'd expect from an AYCE sushi place. I guess it's also kinda dimly lit in there? 

168 sushi is the place I go whenever I'm visiting York."}
{"text":"The ipad idea is great.  Selection fairly decent. Quality alright for an AYCE place.  One of the best things..you get what you order because it is all entered on the pad.  Service good as well.  Senior prices are the best in town."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars
While the service is quite good and the food quality is good the servers sometimes don't give you much attention due to the iPad ordering system. And they do one thing that most Canadian sushi places do do... they put a lot of rice in the sushi which we really don't care for.
The sashimi is fresh. Their white tuna was spot on. You can tell that their selection is a good one from that usually.
Overall, a solid AYCE. Decent price for what you get."}
{"text":"If you want to experience eating in the middle of jungle go head and eat here. The noise of staff making with moving and stacking dishes is super nerve wrecking 
I felt i was at the war eating"}
{"text":"It's was ok nothing special, good price for North York, in downtown Toronto you can find cheaper and better place"}
{"text":"Love the iPad menu. The service was good and the staff was friendly. The food wasn't phenomenal but it was good enough for a buffet"}
{"text":"The food is okay at most.... the place is big but seems dirty. I always get canker sores in my mouth after eating here. (and stomach aches)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The chicken was either uncooked or extremely dry. I love chicken teriyaki, but they have by far the worst chicken terriyaki I've had. It was way too salty and dry and had too much pepper. The sushi was below average. The rice in the sushi was too thick and mushy. The choice of sushi was limited compared to other ayce sushi. 
I give this experience a 3/5 because the only good thing here is the dessert bar. You HAVE to try the shave d ice with jelly, milk, and ice cream! The service was good. The place was nice even though they were renovating. I'd only come back here for the dessert."}
{"text":"The novelty of this place is being able to place orders via an iPad.  The selection available on the buffet menu is quite small compared to the other all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants in Markham.  They also have a buffet area for soup and salad.

The ambiance is nice, the restaurant is moderately loud.  When I was there, they celebrated 2 birthdays where they played the birthday song over the speaker system.  There is also a separate room for events, which I suspect can be booked out."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went on a Friday evening without a reservation to the restaurant.  It was busy but we got seated right away.

Pros:
+ really modern Atmosphere
+ amazing service (using Ipads to place orders)
+ most of the food was really good

Cons:
- somewhat pricey
- some of the food was not upto standards.

Atmosphere (5 stars):
The atmosphere in the restaurant is modern; from the iPad used to make your order to the stylish decorations and buffet. The servers were dressed in attractive uniforms and contributed quite a lot to the atmosphere to this place. 

Food (4 stars)
Food is very fresh, tasty and very nicely presented. The sushi, teriyaki, dumplings are served to you, while the soup, salad and desert are at a self-service buffet table.

Sashimi was fresh and came in generous pieces.  (5 stars)
Grilled octopus was delicious and was the best item we ordered from the grill menu. (5 stars)
We ordered Teriyaki grilled chicken, beef, and salmon.  All of them where over peppered which ruined the taste.  The beef was cooked to perfections (4.5 stars), while the chicken was very dry (2 stars).
We ordered a bunch of sushi rolls they were all good, nothing outstanding.  (4 stars).
We also ordered 2 handrolls, they were tasty, however had too much rice (4 stars).
We also ordered sweet and sour chicken it was left in the fry for a bit too long and the pieces of the chicken were super chewy.  (1 star) 
We ordered mango shrimp, it was spicy and very delicious (4.5 stars).

The Buffet had a 4 soups, a handful of salads (best was crab salad), crab legs, and a few deserts which we did not try this time.  


Service (5 stars):
As opposed to most other AYCE sushi places this one had the best service.  The waiters all spoke perfect english, and came around frequently.  Waiters were not assigned a certain area, so you always got a bunch of people ready to serve you.  

The cost was pretty steep, $30 a person."}
{"text":"A buffet this place is not. A place for average Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai food, it is.

A salad/soup/ice cream bar towards the entrance provides something that's been sitting around for a while to tide the short period of time before items ordered off an order card arrive. Soups: seafood tom yum might as well have been called plain tom yum, flavour was right but came with a layer of oil that coated the bowl. Corn soup was a thick yellow mess. Salads were OK but devoid of lettuce-based goodness. A big plate of crab legs appeared here without explanation.

Items arrive in no specific order, nor do they all necessarily arrive. Sushi and sashimi, despite the fact that the latter is usually the first item to arrive off the order cards while only available at dinner, are below average and the fish is frequently cold (legalities require that fish is frozen once before serving raw, but is usually fully defrosted, unlike here). Sashimi served on chips is just odd: the chips are salted and don't work with the supposedly delicate fish.

Cooked items are mostly average, some better than others, portions are inconsistently sized and sauces either unnecessarily thick or water thin.

All items show up on plates that are far too large and fill up a small table quickly, often making the diner feel as though they're not eating quickly enough for some plates to be removed before they are replaced. Service is warm and welcoming for an AYCE, although I felt treated as though the food and experience was completely foreign to me, despite the opposite being true.

My dining buddy was a little sick shortly after, further reducing my rating of this place. At $23-24 per, a price that we saw nowhere after entering the place, for Sunday dinner, we were disappointed."}
{"text":"Two weekends ago, we had lunch at this restaurant with my parents for an early Christmas get-together and there is another location in Mississauga that we have been to, a couple of times. I love the trendy interior of this place and how they are technologically advanced. 

All food orders are done through a tablet device provided at every table and it's all-you-can-eat so you can order as much or as little food as you like. The dishes are given in small portions, which is perfect for  a light eater for me so I don't require the hassle of bringing home a doggy bag compared to other restaurants I go to.  However, I highly recommend that you order a little bit at a time rather than everything at once because they will charge for leftovers. Some of my favorites from this restaurant include the salmon and tuna sushi, avocado rolls, fried scallop, shrimp tempura, and more which I can't think of at the moment. I tried a bit of everything basically. For dessert, I like closing off with their green tea ice cream. 

Depending on when you go, there might be a bit of a wait time but it's well worth it if you have the patience. We were there around lunch hour so the overall price was a bit cheaper but still on the pricey side. On a happy note, we do get our money's worth at this buffet place and high-grade fish, which is made to order. Also, if you feel intimidated with using a tablet, try to invite a friend or loved one who is technology savvy to come along."}
{"text":"I didn't really research this place when I first went. I was a little disappointed at the price and I wasn't really looking forward to an all-you-can-eat sushi place again. After getting sick at Hockey Sushi, I've mostly written off all-you-can-eat sushi since that last experience. 

I was blown away by this place. The service was above average and the food was above average for a sushi place as well. I like how there was a salad bar to pick what I wanted for my appetizers and dessert. They also had some unique food on the menu which was a nice touch. 

Definitely can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The service is. A bit slow on Holidays but that is expected. Otherwise, the food is good and on the times that I went, they had snow crab. Price is about $31 per person on Holidays. Otherwise it's a good buffet."}
{"text":"The experience was moderate. The sushi was what you would expect from a sushi buffet but I would say a little lower quality than standard. The atmosphere was loud and felt more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. 

Service wasn't bad and the dessert options were alright. To be honest my review would be closer to a 2, but my brother suggested that it was an atypical visit and the food is usually better."}
{"text":"The food wasn't really good, it was salt and the price for each persons was very expensive. The servers would also rush you to finish your meal once the store became to get busy. Honestly the were sooooooo many things that could had gone better to help boost the experience at 168 sushi."}
{"text":"Cool sushi place. The food is pretty generic AYCE sushi. What sets this place apart is the upscale d√©cor, a little bit more selection as far as contemporary rolls, and the service level. Doesn't really separate itself from the pack, although the Ipad ordering system is pretty convenient."}
{"text":"The kalbi ooh babeh ooh babeh galore,
Tempura and lamb soup, mango everything and more!

This place should be called 
MANGO 168  because they had a wiiiiide selection of mango flavoured items like:
[thai mango shrimp] [mango smoothie shrimp] [mango sauce drizzled on green dragon roll - minus 1 star] [mango salad] [mango mousse/pudding] [mango ice cream] 

I was burping mango flavoured gas for the next couple of hours after dinner.

My little one and I had ice cream overload of bowls after bowls while we indulged in some mommy and daughter time. 
The CHOCOLATE ice cream is soo good! 

We had 2 bowls each of 3 scoops, yeah that goooood! So creamy and tasty, like we came here for the sushi and I'm cheating myself on thinking we were loading up on protein but instead we stuffed our faces until our tongues were numb!

Sushi is ok, nothing mind blowing! But service is quick. They have a snow cone machine which was another treat for my girl!

Also, their lamb soup is fresh, hot and very flavourful and surprisingly a new favourite. Pad Thai was bland but not disappointing when you put some hot sauce on it.

Kalbi was moist and tender and we had 10 orders, that's 30 juicy pieces of cow people!!!! My baby girl got her stomach from me.

Refillable drinks and everything done with a swipe and send and the bill!
No debit, just cc and cash."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty great! :) They now have an iPad menu system which makes ordering really simple. At first I thought it was a lot shorter than the previous paper menu and felt somewhat robbed of the \"168 items\".. But, everything I wanted was on there and they actually include pictures of their items as you order. The food arrives very quickly, sometimes too quickly and you don't have anymore space on the table! :) Overall, everything is really fresh. Their sashimi comes in big pieces and tastes amazing. The rolls are delicious too! My brother-in-law is addicted to their BBQ eel sushi, so I would recommend getting some of those. The quality of service is normal compared to many AYCE places, but as I mentioned, the food does arrive quickly. A little pricey, but definitely worth it. Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've never been to an AYCE sushi restaurant with an iPad ordering system before so I was pretty impressed with the ability to use this. Maybe I'm sheltered.
It's good because there is no confusion about what you want, and it's all just brought to the table as it's made. It allowed for very little interaction between staff and patrons. The only conversation was when we accidentally reordered the entire bill a second time and when she brought the payment machine (you even request the bill on the iPad). 
The food was good - definitely no complaints on that front. It was typical AYCE fare. Things could have tasted fresher (veggie-wise - the meats were fine), but they were still perfectly good. They had a salad and dessert bar instead of having those as menu options, which I felt actually worked better than restaurants that have the desserts and salads on the menu. 
I'd probably return but maybe to the Mississauga location instead. I've heard it's better ;)"}
{"text":"Definitely have had better Asian AYCE buffets out there and I am only ever here when people at work wants to come here for lunch. It seems to be a crowd-pleaser kind of place and most people can find something they would eat here.

At $20, I guess it's ok value. Food here is quite basic and nothing will blow your mind. Service can be quick and people (especially kids) do seem to like the fact that you order food using an ipad."}
{"text":"So far so good, we go here about 2 times a year, and is our favourite japenese buffet.  I go for the sushi, the kids attack the self serve ice cream bar.  And service has been top notch every time."}
{"text":"I discovered this place last year October and have enjoyed it ever since. I always loved the selection they have as well as the salad bar. A pretty regular customer there actually, until just recently. 

I started spotting flies around our table as well as the tables next to us, it didn't matter where we were seated. Quite alarming considering its the winter season. I brought my family members here today and wanted them to be impressed with the food quality. As soon as our orders arrived on the table, fruit flies started roaming around our table. We called the server in our section over and warned him about a fly problem. It made us lose our appetite so we finished what we could and went for dessert. 

As my dad was eating his red bean ice cream, he found a piece of hair. So we called the server over again and asked him what that was, pointing to the piece of hair. The server just grabbed the bowl out of my dad's hand, threw it out and didn't come back with any apologies, nothing. As a regular customer of this restaurant, I won't be returning here ever again. With that kind of service and level of cleanliness, it is just very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good and worth the premium over other AYCE sushi places but I went there today and the sushi was just awful!

I got a green dragon roll and it was just not fresh at all. The rice was stale and the avocado had gone bad leaving a rotten taste in your mouth. Pretty much didn't have an appetite after that. This used to be my go to spot every time I came back to Toronto but I'm probably never going to eat here again."}
{"text":"Ok So i've been to many many many sushi places. 

As I was eating, I said \"Meh this place is ok...\"....It won't blow your mind cause its just an average AYCE place. The stuff on their buffet table is \"meh\"... and their desert table is just a gong show. Its so cramped that you have to line up. 

What is going to blow you mind is the price.   The price was just awful and I had a ton of remorse after eating here.   For that price, you gotta give me something to work with and this place does not. 

Wouldn't go back based off of the \"meh\" food for the \"ughhhhhhhhh\" price....."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often with family and friends for AYCE sushi. The atmosphere is great, really modern and spacious, great for a large group of people. Ordering is really convenient as it is done through an iPad. There is also a salad/soup/dessert bar with a decent amount of options. 
It has gotten pricier over the years and the quality of the sushi is sometimes not fresh. 
Still not a bad value for a slightly above average AYCE sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been here over 10 times, including celebrating my wives birthday, The food is very good (you need to try it several times to figure out what you like best as the variety is overwhelming at first). Love their service with the tablets that you can order anything at anytime without looking for a waiter. Would Recommend !"}
{"text":"This place is consistent on food and service which are both good- great!
The ambience is a bit funny, they were playing pop music combined with dim lighting and neon purple lights like an old club that got reopened as a buffet 

Love the iPad ordering system, clear and neat and you know what came and what you are still waiting on. 

The Thai food is strangely good, since this place is more known for the sushi and dim sum highlights. Har gow is petit but shrimp is plump and juicy, standard sushi rolls, tempura shrimp is better than other buffets I've been to. Soup and salad station is small but has quality ingredients, green mango salad and seaweed salad were tasty. Mango pudding shots were a nice finishing touch to the meal.

Would definitely be back again, the lunch pricing is great but dinner may be in the pricier side. 

Lots of parking and kid friendly here."}
{"text":"Love this AYCE sushi place.

I can do without the salad bar but aside from that everything is great. 

Never had an issue with the food or service.

They have the best grilled short ribs out of all the AYCE places"}
{"text":"This buffet is full of happy Korean families so on weekends the noise can be deafening. Well worth it at $15.95 for lunch with extensive selection of Japanese, Korean, Thai and Chinese foods & soups plus salad bar, desserts & ice cream & free soft drink refills. You order via laptop at your table so there are no mistakes. Very clean washrooms too. Tank up, Asian food diners!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars at best- but that fried banana with a scoop of vanilla ice cream deserves a star on its own.

Dined on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Prices are posted over their front windows really big.

There was about a 10 minute wait, but lots of space in the front to wait. Much better than other restaurants that have zero space. Immediately upon entering you get this club-vibe with the purple lighting from above.

This place is another AYCE Japanese that offered iPad ordering. One thing I really enjoyed was after your order is placed, there is no need to wait for a server to come to the table and \"send\" it through. It's automatically done through the iPad. I have yet to experience this from other iPad-ordering systems.

Service was spot on. Drinks were refilled, plates were cleared. The server even got my son a glass of water with a cover and a straw. I really appreciated these little gestures. He even moved my son's highchair when I was trying to get out to grab dessert.

This was the first AYCE Japanese place that also had a self-serve salad bar and dessert bar. This is a really good idea..but it was a bit small for the size of the restaurant. The dessert line can get especially busy since everyone needs to scoop their own ice cream.

Now onto the food: I've had better. All of the grilled items were WAY TOO SALTY & PEPPERY! The portions here are also extremely small, which I can appreciate. We had no trouble finishing the portions.. we even had to order more which was no problem, as we were able to get other items.

Overall, this restaurant is far from home, and I won't be returning. It's not worth the drive. Even if I was in the area there are plenty of other options here."}
{"text":"I work down the street from them and go here weekly, it's always good and most importantly very consistent! They now do their ordering via iPad's which might seem like a gimmick, but it results in VERY fast service; when i go with my co-workers we can be in and out in about a half hour (and still be stuffed from AYCE)! Waiters are all really nice and accommodating.

Fish is fresh and tastey. They have a limited variety of maki's at lunch, but everything i've tried has been good. Some favourites are the soft-shelled crab maki, the sushi pizza's, short ribs, OK chicken, and the salmon roses. 

They are always quick even when they're packed (and the place can hold a lot of people).  Lots of booths and even more tables, two rooms (that can seat around 50 people each) if you wanted to do a \"private\" event/gathering.  I've never waited more than 5 minutes to be seated. Staff are all very nice and will help you order if you're not sure what you like. 

Price is also very reasonable (for 2 people AYCE at lunch comes out to ~$34 including taxes)."}
{"text":"Nice interior, fancy ipad ordering, nice wait staff, and quite packed on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Yup... love this place. The food is good, there's some items I wouldn't get like the calamari it was smelly. Other than that I keep coming back. 

The rolls are amazing they have some rolls that other sushi places don't have. They have great servers who are pretty quick and drop off your food and bounce lol. Hey have a salad bar which you can get your crab legs and seaweed salad. 

The colours make it look like a strop club no lie lol but it's definitely a spot to eat, chill, and just have fun. I've been here a few times and times I've come hungry and times I wasn't hungry at all. Different perspective but still the same quality

Definrily coming back again soon but not too soon"}
{"text":"168 sushi has a very large selection of dishes to choose from such as your typical maki roll to general tao chicken, its to bad everything is just plain boring. Nothing really stands out to me except for when i ordered multiple chicken dishes that came out at a luke warm temp."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in town! They have a wide and delicious selection of sushi/Thai food and their iPad ordering system is super convenient. I also love their ice creams. Would give 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch buffet and sushi selection was limited and cooked food wasn't that great. I ordered a chicken pad Thai and all I got was a plate of noodles with 1 piece of chicken and a bunch of bean sprout. 2 stars for food, +1 star for the decor. Perhaps dinner service would be better?"}
{"text":"Food is a hit or miss. The ipad seems to distract people from the service received. Also the ipad system is what makes this place a bit expensive compared to other sushi restaurants. I feel like the sushi rolls are not tightly rolled ( the condiments fall out when I pick it up with my chopsticks ). They have crab legs occasionally which is great."}
{"text":"I'm the type of yelper that review restaurants solely on the quality of food.  For ayce sushi restaurants, its as good as it gets. Not only you can order from an Ipad (i'm not wooed by the Ipad idea, i've been to other restaurants with it, but it is really convenient to add whatever and whenever you want) I've only been to one other ayce sushi in the whole GTA that can compare, sushi legend.  

The sashimi was overall pretty fresh. The make rolls weren't stuffed with rice to fill you up. My favourite part is the salad bar they have incase you're too hungry you can't wait ! They have some pretty unique stuff on the menu they don;'t usually serve in sushi places, like the spicy salmon taco. Some things on the menu aren't as great as other places, like garlic fried beef. You get hit and misses with some menu items, so try around to see what you like ! 

I'm giving this place a 5-star considering it's all you can eat. My expectation for AYCE lowers since you can't ask for quality food in a buffet. But I'm also comparing 168 to other AYCE sushi places in the GTA, This place is my top 3 , hence why I'm giving the 5 star"}
{"text":"After I ate at 168 Sushi Asian Buffet, I don't think I will be having sushi or Japanese food or buffet for the rest of the week..... and usually I can eat sushi everyday!

Everything is a little bit off at 168 Sushi Asian Buffet. The shari rice, the sauces they use, the fish, the snow crab legs, the funny coloured Miso soup... I just don't feel too good after I have dinner here.

The cooked food though have a good selections of both Thai, Japanese and Korean but they tasted similar.. everything is so saucy... all of them are like drowned in sauce.....
We tried quite a few things from the menu
- Sashimi: Salmon, Red Snapper, Octopus
- Sushi: Tuna (meh)
- Shrimp Tempura (cold and oily)
- Beef with enoki mushroom (quite good)
- Seafood Udon (MEH!!)
- Crab Leg (MEH!)
- Seaweed Salad (look gross)
- Various Rolls: They all just loaded with Tempura bits... every single one of them!!!
- Hand Rolls: Spicy Salomon (loaded with Tempura bits) and Eel roll (Sauce is off!)
- Kalbi (all fat!!)
- Spicy Korean Seafood (meh!)
- Deep Fried Banana (drowned in Maple Syrup)
- Ice Cream

Services is A-OK.. but the servers here are really so obsessed with clearing out our tables as fast as they can... maybe they are playing diner dash?

Luckily I didn't pay full price for our dinner since there's a dealfind special which I took advantage of that.... if not dinner is $23.95 and lunch at $13.95!

BTW, my dinner companion really enjoys the ice cream... I lost count of how many scoops she has?! 10?"}
{"text":"The variety of the sushi is good , however, they increased the prices and the menu is same .. Not sure why.  Overall , it's a good experience and delicious food."}
{"text":"First off, the only place I have been to where you order using an iPad so that's cool! The service is actually super fast and they clean stuff off your table before you can even see it coming lol there are yummy soups and salads buffet style which is really nice. the food itself however it's just ok, nothing too spectacular but not bad either, the sushi is a bit dry and certain dishes are just bland but overall the experience was good, I'll recommend it if only for the fun and easy ordering system!"}
{"text":"Too pricy for too regular. The food is ok, nothing spectacular. There are good variety of options, but in my opinion it was pricy. During the week it is ok, but on weekends I would rather go to somewhere else."}
{"text":"Phenomenal place to eat some simple AYCE sushi!! The restaurant is very clean and modern so you'll never have to worry about a dirty environment while eating. The waiters are very competent in what they do and they're extremely efficient. 

The way you order is via iPad so overall the experience is extremely quick! There's a wide variety of food from sushi to fried food to simple dim sum. There's also a snack bar on the side of you want salad, soup or ice cream! The food is always consistent and dependable so every time you go it's guaranteed you'll have a uniform product which is high in quality!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today expecting really great things given the Yelp praise, but all I can say is meh. It's $14.95 for lunch and $23.95 for dinner (any time). The dinner includes sashimi and a few other items. I saw other people's sashimi, and it looked very fresh. But that's quite a steep price compared to another AYCE sushi chain in Vaughan where unlimited sashimi is included with lunch.

Upon walking into 168, I noticed that there were tons of tweenies here. Probably college students. The interior looks very nice. Gangnam-style was playing in a loop in the background. We ordered a lot of the same dishes we order at other AYCE sushi restaurants, and also decided to include the two dim sum items on the menu.

The good:
- Shrimp tempura was very good.
- Dim sum was fast and good.
- Grilled zucchini was good.
- Red bean ice cream.
- Service was fast.

The bad:
Essentially everything else just wasn't up to par. The eel tasted fishy. The fish didn't taste as fresh. The edamame was overcooked and tasted old.

It's unlikely that we will come back."}
{"text":"I was skeptical before going to this place as I thought the buffet usually do not have the quality food. But I was pleasantly surprised how great the food in this place.  

 It is spacious inside and the ipad ordering is fast and convenient. They also have a salad bar with the salad, soup, ice cream. The mango salad was awesome. I am not giving 5 stars as they had all the blinds down, I usually prefer the restaurant bright and can see through the window. But it is not a big deal. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"All you can eat restaurants can't get a bad rep I tell you. It's like a single mother raising 4 kids, it's hard to do and she needs some love for her trouble. I've never eaten their sushi though supposedly it's not complete shit. Additionally, the food is selectively good, either a hit or a miss. I recommend their deep fried banana and chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Good place overall. The food is mostly great, with the exception of pad Thai - disgusting. Salmon rose sushi is a must try! Amazing.
Ordering on iPads is very convenient. But they are a bit pricey and they've increased their prices some more recently. 
Don't go on a Saturday night - it's packed and noisy."}
{"text":"Good food (not great) and good ambiance. My favourite roll - pink lady. Best part - ordering by iPad. Quite expensive place though...but worth the experience. Also - salad, soup and desert tables were buffet (u take it yourself) so after a long time I had a bowl full of seaweed salad!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi places in the GTA/Vaughan. My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on Saturday for dinner and we were both absolutely amazed at the quality of the food and also the amazing service considering such a high traffic time. Usually most sushi places forget one or two items when you order via the iPad but all our food came fast and tasted great!"}
{"text":"This place used to be really good. The quality has fallen greatly in the 3+ years this place has been open. I remember when this place first opened and there were barely any customers. The fish quality was way better and kitchen dishes were so much better quality. Nowadays the fish is not fresh and smells fishy which is my biggest pet peeves at AYCE sushi places.. and the beef ribs are all fat and no meat. You order like 10 pieces and you'd be lucky to get a total of one mouthful of meat from them lol"}
