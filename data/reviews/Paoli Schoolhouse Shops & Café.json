3.25 - 3.5 stars would be more accurate. 

Everything was pretty solidly average, sometimes slightly above-average. Nothing awful, but nothing was outstanding, either. I'd have no problem dining here again, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to make it happen.  

We ordered a salad to share as an appetizer, and our server split it evenly between two plates before bringing it to the table (without us asking her to); that was a nice touch. However, I just realized (after perusing their online menu to refresh my memory regarding the details of the dishes we had) that we didn't receive the \"Tribeca Ovens baguette and chive & honey butter\" with the salad. The only other misstep was pesto missing from my sandwich (though I didn't realize it was missing until about halfway through, since there was fresh basil on the sandwich). My husband liked his shrimp po' boy with potato salad."}
{"text":"You have to try this restaurant, don't let the schoolhouse name fool you.  I recommend the short rib stew and the burger is fantastic!  They have gluten-sensitive options including gluten-free bread or wrapping the burger in lettuce.  They also provided gluten-free potters crackers with the crab/seafood cheesecake.  The dessert cheesecakes are crustless and gluten free.  This place is a hidden gem and it will definitely be a place we frequent.  The tarragon vinaigrette is must try."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who grew up in the area and was so very surprised when I walked in. The charming gift shop was full of beautiful pieces and the decor that awaited us in the dining room was absolutely lovely. I felt very inspired by the chandeliers and color scheme to redecorate my own apartment! It was truly that beautiful.

Now, as for the food, decadent and fresh are two words that apply perfectly. Everything is local and prepared fresh, so I wasn't surprised when my salad/sandwich arrived and the grapes served with it were still on the vine. I love picking them off, it added to the whole \"homemade\" feel. The food tasted amazing as well. The salad I tried was lightly dressed yet full of flavor, as a salad should be. The turkey club was equally yummy. Served on Madison sourdough bread (my companion was gushing over this) I decided it must be somewhat of a local thing. I normally don't even try bread that isn't french but I gave it a try and, all my snobbery aside, it was quite enjoyable. The bread served with the salad was crisp and fluffy, and the butter it was served with was a delight! It tasted very familiar to me as I grew up in France it can be very hard to get me to like varieties here in America. But this little cafe reminded me of Paris! How lucky for these people who live here.

I give it 5 stars because the food is great, and the decor reminded me so much of my little Parisian cafes, I fell in love. I would love to come back and try dessert next time! Maybe I will be in Wisconsin again and I will have the chance!"}
{"text":"The best flatbread pizza I have ever tasted. Great atmosphere and friendly service. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Literally one of the best meals I have ever had. Good service too! Worth the trip. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and music was great!  Service was extremely friendly but somewhat incompetent.  He was neither knowledgeable nor efficient (wasn't familiar with the menu or order of service- bread served ten minutes after meal/had to be reminded often about drink orders) but attempted to make mistakes right. Food was overpriced and bland with the exception of the mussels.  Steaks (three steaks and three very different sizes) were all overdone and one was sent back.  The kitchen refused to make another steak for the guest of honor who subsequently didn't get to eat dinner.  Med rare should have some pink, this steak was well done, and the chef argued that it was med rare.  We waited and found out 20 minutes later that the waiter, who had said he was bringing another steak, was not going to deliver but instead took the steak off the check. Very disappointing because the place is so cute and the front of house staff were all very friendly."}
{"text":"After seeing great reviews on Yelp, my wife and I stopped by for lunch.  We had high expectations which doesn't always bode well, but the food exceeded our expectations.

My wife had the crab cake sandwich and she loved it.  I was able to get a bite and also thought it was tasty.  The portion size was large enough that she skipped dinner.

I enjoyed the Cajun shrimp po'boy and would have it again.  The spices were perfect.  They gave the sandwich flavor, but was not overpowering.  We are planning on going back soon."}
{"text":"Look up in hidden gem in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of Paoli Schoolhouse Cafe. 

It reminds me of my grandmother's house in a good way! Most of the space is a gift shop, but tucked in the back is the cutest little restaurant.  

I came by the cafe for the Yelp beer dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  The food and service were top notch and I'll definitely be stopping by for another meal soon. 

Also: watch out for Gwen, the resident spirit!"}
{"text":"I've driven past the Paoli Schoolhouse shops for years without ever stopping, and it took some serious procrastination on a friend's birthday to change this.  I'm really happy that I did, because this is a great little store filled with a nice selection of home decor-style gifts.  Patti, the store manager, was really friendly and helped me in narrowing down several options.  I liked how she gave me time to peruse the different rooms and then was immediately there to explain any questions that I had.  She also showed me around and pointed out the location of the new cafe that will be opening soon.  The building is much larger than I had thought, and I'm looking forward to going to the cafe in the future.

The shop itself is situated along Paoli Road in an old schoolhouse - truth in advertising you could say.  I find myself in Paoli most every Friday, as my father's shop is located here and I stop by to help out afternoons.  On this particular Friday I was headed to Madison that evening for a friend's birthday/moving to Nashville party, and being the procrastinator I am I had no gift and absolutely no idea of where to go.  Thankfully my father, ever the problem-solver, suggested that I try one of the places in Paoli.  In the course of 30 minutes at the Paoli Schoolhouse I had found gifts not only for that night's occasion but also for a couple of upcoming weddings & birthdays.  The shop carries several lines of soy candles, including a nice hatbox candle that ended up as my friend's present.  I also found a nice set of golf-themed stone coasters that are destined for an old roommate & golf buddy's upcoming wedding.  The prices were reasonable to me - the products seemed on the upscale side but most everything fell in the $10-30 range.  To top it all off, my selections were all nicely wrapped and presented in gift bags.  I'll definitely be stopping back next time I have to get something nice, and I'm fairly certain it'll be at the last minute like always."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! My boyfriend and I decided to visit Paoli one Sunday and I'd only ever been to the Creamery in Paoli (it is now closed). We were greeted at the Schoolhouse by very gracious, welcoming staff and seated immediately. Our waitress was warm and fun and the restaurant is beautiful! Some old schoolhouse aspects and some vintage french touches. Great combination. We had a lovely view of the stream and everything we ate was amazing. My boyfriend loved his bloody mary and salmon, asparagus, cream cheese omellete. I had a cherry coke and strawberry french toast. Really good! They even brought me the grenadine in a cute little shot glass. The bacon that came with our meals and in Tom's bloody was the best I'd ever had and I've had plenty of bacon! Highly recommend! New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time today, and half way through our meal we made reservations for Valentine's Day weekend. We were so impressed with every aspect of the restaurant! The decor is wonderful, food was amazing, and staff was so friendly. I had the shrimp po'boy, and my husband had the Schoolhouse Burger. We finished with the chocolate pudding cake for dessert. All items were just delightful. We got married across the street at the Paoli Mill last fall, and somehow hadn't stopped at the a Schoolhouse Cafe until today. I'm already looking forward to going back in two weeks!"}
{"text":"This is the cutest place EVER!!! 

My boyfriend and I chanced upon it a few years ago when we stayed at Cameo Rose (another 5* business). The Cameo Rose host directed us to Paoli Schoolhouse and told us her guests visit there for lunch and dinner.

So where's this gem? Well, its only 15 minutes away from downtown Madison! I would say it's as far as Middleton is..!! 

Yes, I'm kinda debating whether I want it to become as crowded as those restaurants downtown and Middleton... But, it's such a wonderful place it is injustice if I don't share it..! Do make reservations on holidays, the place does fill up.. 

Come on over! This place was previously a schoolhouse and now remodeled into a quaint little shop and romantic place for dinner.

I really liked the crabcakes and stuffed mushroom to start. Then the pork tenderloin my boyfriend had was great! My friend also really enjoyed the salmon. For me, the chicken cordon bleu was a little disappointing as it was dry (I'm sorry but I AM a chicken snob.) but the flavorful taste and delicious polenta was enough to save the dish.

Lots of local wine and drinks. The waitress kept filling us up with bread and honey butter. YES, honey butter! you can't get enough of it!! When it took too long to serve our food cos of the huge crowd, she offered to get our drinks! So sweet. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a tasty gem that isn't packed with hungry wolves (unlike the square on weekends). Very romantic and guaranteed to please the lady :)"}
{"text":"You may be thinking, \"but this place is not in Madison.\"  It's ok, be not afraid.  It is a really short drive and is well worth it.  There is a lot of history in the building and the historic location has some fantastic ambiance.  So if you are not the type of person who enjoys history, there are at least some pretty things to look at.  Speaking of pretty things to look at, this would be a great place to bring a pretty thing of your own.  The dishes are pretty to look at too, but you will not want to for very long.  When the dishes come out of the kitchen you will admire the plating for just the briefest moment before  temptation overwhelms and you devour the dish.  The well balanced plates will make you want to come back again and again and explore the menu.  The recently added bar is a bonus and blends into the place nicely and looks great.  There will also be a summer concert series I'm looking forward to.  So for when you want to get away without getting away for too long Paoli Schoolhouse Cafe could be just what you need."}
{"text":"Looks like a gift shop from outside. So glad we went in.  Excellent restaurant.  Nice bar, great food, great service.  Zero issues.  

Had a great goat cheese salad, avocado grilled cheese and a grilled cheese with caramelized onion.  All fantastic. 

Reasonable prices, and a very upscale place without being stuffy. 

Well worth the 20minute ride from Madison!"}
{"text":"Absolutely 100% the worst Easter breakfast ive ever had. Ordered Eggs Benedict ($14) which is my fave. English muffin was raw. Not even warmed. Just raw and cold. Excess water from poorly poached eggs only made it worse. Hollandaise had zero flavor. Potatoes were ice cold. For some reason they also gave me under cooked bacon (which i didnt order). In fact they gave some to everyone whether they ordered it or not. Wont say much about the service. It was adequete but odd. It was a really bad experience and i wont be going back."}
{"text":"We dropped in at the schoolhouse cafe on a whim. We were across the street visiting the Artisan Gallery and saw the cafe on our way out. 

Very charming place. The wall paper and glass beaded lights gives you that old house charm but we were sitter at a high table on contemporary designed tile flooring and white door frames, giving us a modern feel.  Cozy and charming.

I had the beef pot pie and my little much mate had the gumbo. Both were excellent! The pot pie was served in a bakeware with a puffy pastry cover and fresh fruits on the side. The gumbo was served with fish and shrimps. Both were seasoned deliciously. Not salty, which is what I like, and not bland at all. The other place that I had a memorable pot pie was in Australia. The gumbo was better than a New Orleans restaurant that I frequent. 

Overall, a winner. Note the portion is on the smaller side for the price."}
{"text":"Awesome.  This is all I can say. The atmosphere, service, and every dish was stellar.  I brought my mother here for a very special birthday and without even asking they recognized it and lit a candle for her.  Amazing.  I almost don't want to give a 5-star rating so I can keep this place to myself."}
{"text":"Cute shop....I've been here a couple times. I would love to go back and try the dinner menu, however, I might pass. You better look like you have money, walking in, because, if you just happen to come in, looking casual.....
I've never been looked up and down, so obviously, before, walking in here. So awkward! So sorry, I came in, not planning on shopping, with my casual attire. Word of advise for ANYONE that don't know anyone's business......don't judge by how someone looks. Yo have no idea what I do for a living and how much $ I make. I would've loved to buy a nice piece of jewelry but NO THANKS NOW!"}
{"text":"Our first time here was so nice, although Paoli is a very small town this is worth a stop. The building itself is historic and has been renovated with charming decor inside. A very nice patio on the back looks like a really nice place to have a drink and hang out in the shade by the river. The food was excellent, and the service prompt and friendly. This is the kind of place where you can wear casual or dress clothes and fit in."}
{"text":"First things first: Shout out to yelp events! I've been to two of them this week and they were both a blast.  Not to mention, I would have no idea this place existed otherwise.  I was a plus one at the elite yelp event and beer dinner at the Paoli Schoolhouse, but I'm going to yelp my way to elite status just so I get more invites to these things.

Now, without further ado, my glowing review:

The Paoli Schoolhouse staff told us all about Gwen, the school teacher's ghost that haunts this former one room schoolhouse turned cafe and boutique gift shop. Gwen apparently likes to light up unplugged christmas trees and make appearances in turn-of-the century garb. The stories were entertaining, and believable for one reason. If I died today, I would drive my ghost car directly to Paoli and join Gwen in the schoolhouse for an eternity of delicious food, a cozy environment, and wonderful staff. 

We were told that Chef Krista is new to the restaurant and the profession in general. After eating the 4 courses she prepared for us, and being blown away by every dish, I found it hard to believe. Sure enough, she introduced herself after the meal and is a recent grad from the MATC culinary program. As an employee of a very young company myself, I suppose I should recognize that talent is not always exlusive to the expierenced.

The cafe is small and intimate, with just two rooms of tables. The fireplace and patterned wallpaper add to the cozy atmosphere. Maybe it's just my style, but it really made me feel at home. I think some time around course #3 was when I started getting decorating ideas for my own apartment, but that might be because it was also when we started beer #4.

Paoli isn't that far outside of Madison, but it's definitely off the beaten path.  I don't know how a restaurant that feels like it's in the middle of nowhere ended up with such phenomenal service.  Maybe it's small town hospitality? In any case, I think Gwen and I will have a really great time haunting such a friendly group of employees."}
{"text":"A very cute restaurant outside of Madison. It's casual fine dining. You can get the quality from Madison Capitol restaurant for a lower price. Also the staff are really sweet.

I suggest the salmon. Cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch, with my Thursday morning knitting friends, Mary and Laura!  I had an excellent grilled cheese with fried onions. A side of fennel coleslaw. In uses a small gift shop, milk paint items, serving dishes and small chandeliers. Would go again anytime. Excellent service. I'm"}
{"text":"From the horrible service to the undercooked food, the Paoli Schoolhouse had it all. We arrived for brunch on a Sunday and were sat inside. From there it took 10 minutes and someone bussing tables to ask if anyone had helped us yet. Our server appeared shortly after and when we placed our drink order of 2 waters, coffee and an orange juice - a half cup of coffee was the only thing delivered. After several more minutes I had to ask the busser for water which she got for us. Even though our server passed us at least a dozen times - she never once stopped at our table. The hostess finally came to take our order and finally brought the orange juice once we asked for it. Then our red potatoes in our open omelettes were not fully cooked. After our meal was complete our server did finally show up. Was it super busy you may ask? Nope, tables outside were full, but inside there were many tables with no one there. The decor was great - but the service was the worst I've had in years. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great in the summer. Sit outside near the river.  Great food and service.  Paoli is a beautiful place visit any time of the year.  Visit the galleries and the cheese store.  1of a kind town."}
{"text":"Great menu lots of delicious selection. The grilled cheese with the potato salad were excellent. Chicken avocado sandwich with the coleslaw was yummy."}
{"text":"I went with Papa, Mama J, and Babe for a belated Mama's Day lunch to the cafe last Saturday at about 11:30 am. I had the tomato bisque, shrimp po boy and potato salad, Papa had the same thing, Mama J had the grilled cheese, and Babe had the turkey Sammy with the apple and fennel Cole slaw. All of it was delicious, really really good. Prices were about $10 a meal which is inline with Madison. The decor is super charming and Paoli is quaint. If you want a nice view take the exit from Verona Road, it's so beautiful this time of year."}
{"text":"Delightful, delicious lunch. The Decor is pleasant and relaxing in a lovely rural setting. The round table in the corner was perfect for a quiet lunch before where we also enjoyed the very recently updated wine list. Our waitress was talkative, pleasant and attentive. Every one of us felt our meal was Very good. We will definitely be back often. As some other reviews said, a real gem.."}
{"text":"This place is very nice for lunch, Very nice little quaint place with a patio out back next to a flowing creek which can be great on a nice sunny summer day. It's very reasonably priced, and they have the best homemade soup within the surrounding area's that I have had yet to date.. The rest of the menu is much to brag about as well, been there about a handful of times and will continue to bring good friends there, also I know they use lots of locally grown ingredients.."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place. 
But - for very simple food - the price is way too high. 
We order mussels ( among other dishes) and it was big mistake. Yes I know - it's the wrong month to order mussels but its but it was much more \"not ok\" to serve us these mussels - regardless the way too expensive price. 
Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious. The salmon cheesecake was awesome! My six year old had the turkey pot pie, my other two kids had the open faced pork breakfast sandwich and the grilled cheese. My husband had the bacon bourbon cheeseburger. Everything was very good! We loved the decor and the little store. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"(I'd give it more 4 1/2 stars...)

I bike though Paoli regularly as I live in Southwest Madison. We've always talked about having brunch or visiting the galleries in Paoli, but had not yet made the visit.

Family asked if we'd like to meet for dinner at the Paoli Schoolhouse as it is now open Thurs - Sat for dinner. 

We had a lovely time, beautiful intimate setting without being pretentious. I've heard they also have great patio seating but we sat inside.  There were just a few parties dining, but we arrived late on a weeknight and the just started dinner hours. Was delightful.

They have a wine list including sparkling wines/cavas, and bar.

Menu is not exhaustive, but there is a variety including salads, pasta, meats, crab cakes, etc. Dinners range from $14-20 and include house salad, entree with accompanying side dishes.

We ordered a bottle of  Malbec, and our group had the special of the evening which was a steak with red wine reduction, garlic mashed potatoes, and variety of (perfectly done) summer vegetabes - zucchini, squash, carrots. Chose a summer salad of mixed greens, strawberries, pecans, with a champagne blush vinaigrette. Save room for dessert - they were out of the fresh strawberry shortcake, but we opted to share a slice of coconut cream pie, red velvet cake, and a lovely apricot sorbet.

Really had a wonderful time and this is a gem of a place very close to Madison. Much recommended.

(Note: also found a stylish summer top in the shop while waiting--pleasant surprise!)"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed in Paoli for a month while visiting our family. We ate in various restaurants in and around the Madison area and this restaurant is our favorite! All of the food is exceptional but if you like coconut cream pie- they make the best I've eaten! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a neat location with little shops and a sizable art gallery on the same street. The restaurant itself has a charming interior and presents food in a lovely way. Our table of six tried a variety of dishes - chicken pot pie, seafood ravioli, barbecue pork sliders, beet salad, chicken salad, soups, coconut pie, school themed cocktails... it was all very good! More than one person in our group left a little hungry though. The portions on most dishes are small. Nice for a summer lunch or tea!"}
{"text":"We had an event in Verona to attend on Easter Sunday, so we made a reservation at Paoli Schoolhouse Café for brunch beforehand. We'd never been there before, and I've been curious about the place for awhile. I was surprised that it was so easy to reserve, and in fact the place was not crowded at all when we arrived.

We entered the building and found ourselves in a gift shop and waiting room area, and no one came to check us in for several minutes, until we wandered closer to the dining area and peeked our heads in. The hostess then seated us. The table for two was one of only two pub tables I saw, and it was just pub-style height enough to make it awkward to put your feet either on the floor or on the chair rungs. As a bonus, I had to sit on my coat; the surface of the seat was badly crackled faux leather, and my lace dress and nylons would definitely have caught and snagged. The rest of the tables are normal height and the seats are covered in velvet.

Our waitress, friendly and wearing a tiara, was very nice and efficient. A bit too familiar for my daughter's preference, as she was the recipient of several motherly pats and hugs. Not everyone is comfortable with that type of physical contact. Just something to think about. 

The food was basic and standard. Nothing to write home about, but it was fine. Requests for substitutions or deletions to dishes were not possible because they had everything pre-made, presumably in steam tables, and the kitchen staff apparently just fills plates. The Easter brunch had a separate printed menu, but the list of dishes was identical to their standard brunch menu. Odd. Dark coffee; it wasn't bad. The omelet came with a plasticky triangle of american cheese melted on top of it. The eggs benedict was well prepared, except that the hollandaise was straight up bitter. I could taste bitter lemon and (I could swear) vinegar, very predominantly. I couldn't finish it for that reason, which was a shame. My daughter said her coconut cream pie was excellent. The waitress was overly insistent that I try it, after I said no thanks several times. I'm sure she was just trying too hard, but we could have used her dialing it down just a notch on all fronts.

Very cute country French-esqe interior, tiny chandeliers and shabby chic furniture. Wide, rough-hewn wood slat walls with windows left in provide room separations. Nice touches like sugar lumps in reproduction pink depression glass dishes on each table. The gift shop had well chosen items and was attractively styled.

All in all, it was fine. It seems like the other reviews really liked this place for other meals, so we'll try them again sometime for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to have a brunch/lunch meal. We bike down from Madison to eat here. A perfect bike ride to a great place to eat. The food and drinks have always been good. We have been multiple times and sometimes it's a longer wait for a table on those busier days (mother's day, etc). Prices are moderate for the 'Madison' area. I think this place is more about the atmosphere. (It reminds me of a cup of afternoon tea and scones.) I wonder if they have ever thought of serving high tea in the afternoons for their guests? Just a thought..."}
{"text":"When you do the famous bike to Paoli, it is mandatory to visit the schoolhouse. My Crab Cheesecake was delicious! It definitely needs the Potters crackers, because alone it is too cheesy. Do not expect a crab cake, it's more like a quiche. The lumps of crab make it worth it. The ambiance is very cute, worth the trip!"}
{"text":"We moved from Madison several years ago, but always return to the Paoli Schoolhouse when we return for a visit.  

I called and left a message with information for a reservations  (this has been the process in years past as well).  When we arrived, they did not have the reservation because \"they didn't check the messages\".... (seemed odd since this has never happened before)

We were able to get a table, and were quickly greeted by our server.  I was disappointed because one of my favorite items --- a staple on the menu for years --- was no longer offered (Crab Louis Salad).  Instead, I had their chicken salad, and frankly I have to say that it was unremarkable.  It was good, just not memorable. 

Dessert was ordered and was up to expected standards.   

We Will be back on our next visit.   I have to wonder what has changed over the past year, though.  The front desk staff was not as friendly as usual, the items in the boutique/gift area seemed sparse and it just seemed to have a somewhat different vibe than I am used to (having dined there dozens of times over the past ten years).  Hopefully, it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a little story about one of the best meals I've ever had in my life!

Once upon a time I went to Paoli Schoolhouse Cafe. 
Krista made pork.
It was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. 
The End.

Not sold? Honestly, I don't know what else I can say about the place that will do it the justice it deserves. First of all, I hate pork, so the fact that chef Krista got me to eat it is pretty remarkable. How did this happen? Expert preparation. Juicy, easy to cut through with just enough pink. It was simple, flavorful, absolutely perfect, and I'm not certain when or if I'll have something so great again. Flash forward to dessert and she did it again, this time with cheesecake. Aside from my aversion to lactose I don't love cheesecake because I loathe it's main ingredient, cream cheese. Call me crazy but the idea of shmearing thick white sour dairy on a bagel just doesn't get me going, but I digress. This cheesecake was phenom. Sweet chocolate with a cookie crust that had a tinge of salt to balance the sweet... again simply perfect. 

In addition to the rad food that's being plated, the place has a staff that knows they have something special and that level of care and appreciation runs rampant throughout the building. I've been on a few occasions now and each time I've had incredible servers who are quick to make menu recommendations and don't mind making substitutions as they arise. 

The history of the building (ask someone about Gwen) is chilling, yet warm and inviting, and when I'm there I can't help but think, \"Man I wish this were closer to the capitol.\" Then I think, \"Who am I kidding, it took me 20 minutes to get here, it takes me longer to buy toothpaste at Target (damn you end caps distracting me from my goals).\" Point is, they're close. They're worth it. Check 'em out. 
The End (really this time)."}
{"text":"Ok, everyone's said it already, but I'm going to say it again anyway. This restaurant is soooo cute! I love the concept of a schoolhouse converted into a posh looking cafe with delicious food. The best part is, it's super bike friendly! My bf and I rode out here from Madison and decided to stop in for brunch before riding back. They suggested we take our bikes around back to the outside patio and keep them on the grass in our sight, which was very considerate.

We happened to get there while they were hosting a brunch event, so they gave us ample warning that our food might take a while once we ordered. Neither of us thought the wait was long at all, and we were starving from our bike ride. We ordered the reuben and the chicken salad, and both were very tasty and served with the perfect sides. The chicken salad was especially unique, with grapes and dried montmorency cherries mixed in with a poppy seed dressing. We were both impressed with the food and the attentive service. They even gave us extra water for our ride back!

I highly recommend visiting this place to go relax on the patio or sit at one of the charming indoor tables and enjoy a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Although my date is usually my husband, this is without a doubt your classic \"ladies who lunch\" place.  From the literal shopping at your fingertips to the décor, this is a place to take your mother for her birthday, have some girl time over drinks and dessert or just plain-old grab your friends who like good food surrounded by pretty things and quality yet casual service (you are in Paoli, WI after all).

Never had a bad meal, lunch or dinner.  Oh, and did I mention the desserts are made in-house?  The coconut cream pie is TO DIE FOR!  Seriously.  Go just for the pie and I promise you will not be disappointed.  The most recent yummy menu items we tried was the burger...OMG.  Truly wonderful.

Out of all the place in and around Madison, this is where we always want to take our out of town guest.  We are luck to live so close to such a gem."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, and it certainly lived up to the reviews!  The inside is beautiful - with a few small seating areas which keeps it feeling intimate and a wonderful attention to detail in everything from the walls to the table settings.

From being greeted to when we walked out the door the staff were friendly and attentive.  And the food.  I honestly can't wait to go back.  We went on Father's Day, so there were some specials, including a steak and eggs which included a 4 oz tenderloin (cooked to perfection, exactly as requested), home fries (maybe the best I've ever had), and two eggs (these came cooked wrong, but were so good I didn't even care or mention it).  

They have a nice bar menu, the cheesecake mentioned in another review absolutely did not disappoint, and I am already thinking of going back to try out one of their burgers (which come served on a Stella's spicy cheesebread bun).  The only thing we wished was that they had more of a brunch menu.  The regular menu was all lunch items (except maybe the quiche), though they did have a couple of breakfast items for the day's special.

The shop in the front carries small gift items, bath items, and jewelry.  I managed to find the perfect wedding gift for a picky relative on my way out.  Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Reservation was screwed up, service was poor - server wasn't friendly - ordering process was food first then drinks.   Waited forever for the drinks.  Food was average"}
{"text":"Sometimes when you call a place a hidden gem people will think \"Ok, sounds good, I'll keep that in the mind..\" and if they ever walk/drive/hear about your recommendation later on in life they will remember and they might check it out. 

But this time when I say WOW Paoli's Cafe is AMAZING and you NEED to check it out NOW I mean, go get in your car, turn on your GPS and go there. Now. No seriously. Here are your keys....and I call shotgun!

I was here for a Yelp Elite event earlier this evening and as I was driving to Paoli's SC I was really skeptical. I was driving through corn fields then all of a sudden my GPS is telling me to veer off to the left and onto this street where everything is named \"Paoli ___\". There was a joke that we doubled the Paoli population the night we had the event ;)

But I parked and went in.....and I literally stood in the doorway for about a minute taking everything in. If you are active on Pintrest or you like interior decorating the Shop in the front of the house is really beautiful. Everything there is vintage-esque and it has the rusty ventian chic look going for it. 

The food that was served was immaculate. I'm not sure if it is food of their regular menu but the chef has magic hands and I would trust that anything she made would be fabulous. Chef Krista hasn't been with them for long as a Chef but she sure knows what she is doing! 

The service was by far the best I've ever had (save the Four Seasons in DC). The staff were always refilling glasses, replenishing silverware, removing plates and bottles, and all done quite stealthily I might add. It's always refreshing to see people that take the true meaning of customer service and take pride in giving the best that they can. 

Like I said at the beginning of this review, this place is truly a hidden gem...but now that I've found it I can guarantee that I will be back many more times. And I will be forcing many of my friends to go here as well ;)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and went with the salmon & crab cake sandwich. The meal was pretty disappointing. The bread was soggy. The cake itself was pretty small and lacked flavor. The sandwich was supposed to have avocado and a tomato jelly. Mine only had 2 small pieces of avocado and there was barely any jam. 

The staff was very friendly. They have a great outdoor area which is great for eating outside."}
{"text":"Service will be slow. Kitchen is not a professional kitchen. Food is so so!!! Boring menu."}
{"text":"Great setting.  Service was good not great.  Food same thing and actually  overpriced.  This was our 4th visit! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Was just here last weekend and was NOT impressed with the host working Sunday lunch.  He was rude and gave us an attitude for not having a reservation for 2 people (sorry!).  We asked to sit outside and gave our name and phone number and were told there would be a 30 min wait.  We left thinking the host would call us after 30 min and as we did, there was NO ONE sitting outside----at least 10 open tables (so I'm not sure why there was such a wait).  Unfortunately, we NEVER heard from the host.  Since we received such attitude, we weren't really that upset, but definitely not very customer service oriented.  It looked cute, but unfortunately I can't comment on the food.  Not impressed."}
