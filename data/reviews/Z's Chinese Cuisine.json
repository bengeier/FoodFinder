{"text":"I ordered take out.  The waitress was not very helpful answering questions about the menu items (which have NO description).  She told me the SHRIMP WITH VEGETABLES came with a brown gravy.  I asked if she meant brown sauce.  She didn't seem to understand but assured me that I would like it. I received my order via the chef in a few minutes.  There was NO brown anything on this dish, the shrimp were over cooked and rubbery, it lacked flavor and needed seasoning.  The rice was not cooked well either (how can you mess up white rice?).  There were several hard grains in the rice (crunchy).  This is the worse chinese food I have ever eaten and will NOT return."}
{"text":"Great service, and the General Tao chicken was tasty! Glad to have more choices in my neighborhood. The large dining area would be great for big groups."}
{"text":"Not what I was hoping for this evening.
Had take out lunch about 3 weeks ago...was happy with portion, and the fact that it also came with an egg roll and fried crab puff.
This evening I ordered a large pork chop suey and my husband ordered a large orange chicken...only one pint of rice came with the order... bottom of bag was wet with juice from food... pork chop suey was only half full and no egg rolls or crab puffs.
Will not return."}
{"text":"Very good Cantonese food. If you visit a Cantonese restaurant, order from the Cantonese menu. It's pretty simple, folks. This place only does passable American-Chinese food, so just get your Kung Pao elsewhere unless you're the type who goes to a Mexican restaurant, orders a hamburger, then complains about the hamburger."}
{"text":"The food here is really authentic and the staff is great. Food always comes out fresh and hot. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves authentic Asian food!"}
{"text":"Another disappointing Chinese restaurant their Saving Grace was their crap house that were actually pretty good other than that food had no flavor no spice even when you ask for chili pay stores oil it was super Bland no spice at all very oily service was very mediocre forgot to bring drinks forgot to bring silverware brought one of the dishes and then took 10 minutes for the other one by then my food is getting cold I suggest going somewhere else unfortunately"}
{"text":"Upon walking in in the early evening, there were no other tables in here! It is a very spacious restaurant with many tables! My mom and I were greeted upon entering. We ordered shrimp with lobster sauce and some rice on the side. It was definitely enough to serve two people who aren't too hungry. This restaurant is Cantonese style, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this dish not expecting too much. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, with the shrimp texture that's crunchy and not chewy as if it would be if it was over cooked. There were peas, carrots, green onions, and pork sung (or pork floss, whatever you want to call it). As for the white rice--mini story time: they gave us only one bowl at first, but we said we wanted a second bowl, and they gave us a whole rice container, which they warned us would be an extra charge for the greater amount of rice. Makes sense though...but anyway they later decided to waive the extra charge associated with the large container and make it a free upgrade from the one bowl of rice for some reason, which was very nice of them. The server also had made recommendations for us prior to ordering but we decided to decline the dishes because we wanted the shrimp with lobster sauce specifically, and they did check up on us during our meal at least once to make sure everything was okay. Overall, reasonable price for a good portion, and the quality of the food here is pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good and very pleased. This place is new and the food is good so a few more years here it might be the hot spot for authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Awesome new place great food and low prices. We will be back. No beer yet but soon. The best mu shu pork I ever had."}
{"text":"So I just walked in to try this place and walked right back out. I saw the cook tasting the food and cooking with the  same spoon. That is disgusting!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant I've ever been too. The food is fresh, never bland, and always quick. I love how many vegetarian options they have. My only regret is that they don't do delivery, but the food is definitely worth driving too. I don't know why there are so many negative reviews on here- the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Just an FYI- they were closed on a 645pm Wed night. Called 3x & drive over to the location in hopes they were just busy. come to think of it, I don't recall the lights being on for business at night. Sooo what's happening!!"}
{"text":"I was greeted with a cheery how are you and seated. Drink order taken and served promptly. I ordered the sweet and sour pork. First came the egg drop soup, it was delicious. My sweet and sour pork came with fried rice, an egg roll and a crab puff. The food was plentiful and very good. I took enough home for a 2nd meal. This was my first time here and won't be my last. 

1/2/18
I had lunch here today. The food was served and then the waitress walked out the front door and left, she was the only waitress here so that meant no drink refills, I saw another table get their own to go container out of a box, nobody to help anybody. Finally after 20 minutes she came back. My companion asked for a container and she brought it but instead of handing it to her she picked up her plate and scraped the food in there, companion didn't want the tasteless rice but she didn't care and put everything in there. We were upset, paid and left. We won't ever be back! Waitress needs some coaching in how to treat customers. No stars today."}
{"text":"This is not like the other Chinese Restaurants. They offer the typical Chinese American Favorites and they also offer a Cantonese Menu with some hard to find menu items like Pork Blood with Leeks and Beef with Bitter Melon.

I do note the restaurant is new and we encountered SERVICE PROBLEMS. 

Our server (I think co-owner) disapproved of me (non-Asian) ordering the Chicken with Tiger Lily and Fungus Hot Pot. She said, \"you won't like it\" \"only Asian people eat it\" So I asked, \"why won't I like it?\" \"She just said you won't like it\" \"Skin and bone.\" .........The conversation went on a little longer but then she runs into the kitchen and makes the order before even asking my husband what he wants......

She then looks at my husband and suggest that he order the Beef and Broccoli off the American/Chinese Menu. My husband got slightly insulted and told here that he didn't drive here for beef and broccoli. He ordered the pork belly and she warned him that it was fatty.

In a little while my order come out. I'm not Asian so I can't say how this version of Chicken with Tiger Lily and Fungus Hot Pot compares to others but I can tell you the broth was very good and developed with lots of natural chicken flavor. The chicken meat was tender and very flavorful. The chicken was sliced leg threw the bone and was done very well and almost fragment free. I had to clean the skin and stuff to eat but it made for good eating and had very good flavor. I didn't know if the dish actually contained Tiger lily....if it did it contained only a few small pieces. 

We figured my husband's dish wasn't coming so we both just ate mine.

After 20 minutes his dish finally arrives and my husband tells the server he doesn't want it now because it took so long.

It's great that we now have an option for Tasty Cantonese Cuisine on the WEST SIDE but might we get it ...............with service problems.

Hopefully things will improve and the server will learn that non-Asians do like to order Cantonese Food."}
{"text":"Z's good service overshadows it's very ans somewhat  below average food. Whether is the Orange Chicken or Mongolian Beef there's not a lot of flavor and a  whole lot of gravy.

The restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly and accomdating.  Wish the food was better"}
{"text":"Was craving some Hot N Sour soup, so stopped by with high hopes it would be better than the norm.  Pretty average, but that's okay. 
The crab puffs were divine.  Very light and crispy and better than most of the other Chinese places around. 

I got lemon chicken for my entree, it was just meh. Not good, but not bad either. Probably wouldn't order it again, but I am willing to come back and try out some other stuff, especially that Cantonese menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout last night, here is the breakdown of items ordered:
Sweets and sour chicken- not great. Flavor is off. My daughter didn't eat it she kept picking at it and me, well I'm not one to waste food but I'm not a fan. 
Fried rice- average not amazing, not bad. 
House lo mein- I really liked this. Good flavor. 
Price overall was good. Friendly and quick staff. I might try other items if I decided to go back and give it a second chance."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  It has new owners and the food is fresh, affordable and amazing. The lunch specials are under $6 and prepared fresh.  They have by far the best egg rolls I've had in years.  The soups were good and we both thoroughly enjoyed the entrees.  I highly recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the quiet atmosphere, the food was really good with large portions.      Waitress was super nice.    Nice place for relaxing while enjoying  good Chinese food.   We will be back."}
{"text":"We had take out dinner last night.  The food is good and priced reasonably compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area.  We recommend the crab puffs and orange chicken!  If you get the take out please check your order, they forgot one order of rice."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good Chinese restaurant with no luck so far. Tried this one on a recommendation from a friend. It was really good and much better than the others I tried."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place because of location. There is a circle of Chinese restaurants that we rotate through - Wong Jr., Big Heng, China Place, Golden Dragon, China Rainbow, Grand Dragon, D & Y, T &J and more, but we always want to add more. Unfortunately, this won't be one.

The hot and sour soup was the worst I can remember. I make hot and sour soup occasionally and it's better by a factor of ten. If a professional can't do it better, what's the point? It was the broth that was lacking most, but I can't put it into words.

I usually order chicken and vegetables on the first visit. If they can make something so basic taste good then the other things should be. The white sauce was watery. The meat and vegetables weren't bad, but they weren't good - bland.

My companion had Kung Pao chicken. Unlike another reviewer, hers had only a few green onions and many red chilies. The chicken had a \"funny\" taste. She hypothesized it was because of fish sauce which she doesn't care for. Her egg drop soup was barely acceptable.

The best things were the cream cheese puff and egg roll.

The stake through the heart was charging a credit card processing fee. I don't think I have been charged a CC fee in 30 years. They won't last long. Too bad."}
{"text":"Best house chicken out of any other restaurant; hands down. Very good customer service, and food is served quick and hot. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"3 stars because the staff was very friendly and the restaurant appears clean. I had the kung pao chicken which was ok but had too many bell peppers, onions, red chilies and ginger. My son had the walnut shrimp in which he liked. The cream puffs were just ok."}
{"text":"Always looking for good Chinese food and they definitely did not disappoint!! Very good service!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I got the general tso chicken and it literally tasted like a rotten cardboard box. We had to keep calling waitress over when we needed something. The $4.99 lunch deal is too good to be true, save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered off the lunch menu to go. Orange chicken. Food was not impressive (different than any other Asian cuisine) and lacked any flavor resembling 'orange'. They told me the soup that came w meal isn't included to go so that was disappointing considering I already paid. Nothing special is the best way to describe the food"}
{"text":"This was a great find when the restaurant we were looking for was closed! Everything we ordered was made with fresh ingredients and showed in the flavor! The prices are more than reasonable for this quality and the server was warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow Amazing food and fabulous service, at a reasonable price, their Iced tea is so good you don't need any sugar or sweetener, that's huge for me! I went with my girlfriend for a late lunch so not many people, I can't wait to have Dinner there! This is not your run of the mill Chinese restaurant, the flavors are so good! I had the Walnut Shrimp with Broccoli. My friend had the Eggplant with vegetables! They have Vegan choices, and I'm gluten free, plus they will alter the spice to fit your palate! They also have beer and wine avail!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Their service could be improved, but their food is absolutely delicuous! I tried their Kung Pao chicken &  Pepper Steak, I was not disappointed! They're new and I'm glad they opened next to me."}
{"text":"My first time at Z's. I ordered the Fish Fillet in Black Bean Sauce, Orange Chicken & a side order of House Fried Rice. The Orange Chicken was in a darker sweeter sauce, but very flavorful with a bit of spice to it. The Fish Fillet dish had a decent amount of fish in it, stir fried with green peppers & red onion. The House Fried Rice had plenty of chicken & beef in it, yet only 3 shrimp? It wasn't bad, but I've had better. The restaurant itself is very spacious, with circular tables in the center of the room & booths along the adjacent walls. I would be interested in returning. The only gripe I had was the two waitresses that were there, did very little to make me fill welcomed. The waitress that took my order, passed by me 7 times before she asked me how was things. (\"She had a very stiff Security Guard on Duty look & Demeanor.\") The other waitress sat across from me and looked at me four different times, and never asked me how was things. With service like that, I wonder why I even bother to tip. So, if you don't mind paying 9.2% tax for you food & can totally ignore the low level of people skills the staff has, then give Z's Chinese Cuisine a try. CHEERS!!"}
