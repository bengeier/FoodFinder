{"text":"This is our favorite spot for Indian food in this part of the city. Great flavors, plenty of vegetarian and non-veggie options, and the fish curries are exceptional. Also does take-out and delivery. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been on a quest for exceptional Indian food since moving to North York. My search is over! We ordered samosas, butter chicken, lamb saag, rice, and garlic naan - standard items I order to compare to other places. Tasting it reminded me of the first time I had Indian food. My eyes watered - not from spice but from happiness! The food was so flavourful, fresh, and satisfying to all my taste buds. It took some time to arrive, but they just opened recently and when we called, customer service was exemplary. We felt they really cared. The delivery person also impressed me. It is rare that when I order food for delivery, the person buzzes up to my condo and greets me by name, introduces themselves and says what restaurant they are from and, joyous joy, that they have my food. It was so professional and reassuring, too! Well done, Great Maratha. From the staff to the food, top marks! We will be ordering again soon and look forward to trying some new dishes from your impressive menu!"}
{"text":"So happy to discover this new Indian resto in our neighborhood. My husband enjoys Indian spices but my taste buds unfortunately don't tolerate them. Our server was extremely accommodating and I thoroughly enjoyed a very flavourful but not spicy chicken dish. Both soups the lentil and tomato were also delicious. All in all, we were so happy with the food, service and ambiance, we came back the following week with our family. We will definitely return and tell all our friends about the Great Maratha."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service. We had Vindaloo chicken and lamb biryani. Very good meat (no fat and all lean meat). Very great aroma in restaurant with authentic feel.   The hosts are incredible and make sure you try the vindaloo sauce on the side if you want some extra kick :)"}
{"text":"We have eaten here at least a dozen times since it opened. The food has been great every time. Lunch and dinner have both been terrific. We really like the korma and the vindaloo. The naan bread is the best I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. It took them an hour and a half to bring appetizers and they give online orders much higher priority than dine-in customers. It was also freezing cold because the door did not shut properly. The food was decent, but don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"Wow. This place blew my mind. Butter chicken like I've never had before, with sweet undertones, it was awesome!! Also, the goat Curry was loaded with meat goodness and minimal bones.  And of course, samosas were fresh and heavenly.   Scared and excited to live around the corner. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just amazing.  We used the Groupon Coupon and went there last night for my birthday.  Loved it, loved it and loved it.  The naan and paneer kulcha was just amazing, so was the non-veg tandoor platter, the bhindi masala, lamb roganjosh.  To top it all we had the sizzling brownie for dessert.  Highly recommended and would go there for more.  Authentic Indian food without the  overpowering spicy sensation.  We also enjoyed chatting with the owner; he was friendly, and had an interesting story for the beginnings of his restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service. I've enjoyed mainly their way dishes. We've tried the Alfonso Chicken, it's amazing, doesn't lack flavour but is sweet. The Madras is also good but has a nice little kick to it of spice. Also tried their butter chicken wasn't bad but the portion was really small. I recommend the food served here and will order again."}
{"text":"This neighbourhood Bathurst and Eglinton Indian Restaurant offers a broad range of fresh meat, fish, and vegetarian dishes, seasoned and cooked to perfection.   The prawns masala was excellent as was the malabari fish.  The saag beef also did not disappoint and the alphanso chicken was a sweet and tangy alternative to perhaps the butter chicken (which the staff say is also very good).  I found the owner and staff to be very friendly, patient and interested in pleasing their customers.  The restaurant is open for lunch and offers lunch specials.  I would definitely take out from this place again and look forward to trying some new dishes such as the lamb rogan josh and the whole fish (maratha pomfret).  If one prefers to dine in, there is a comfortable and clean space in which to do so."}
{"text":"Ordered through JUST EAT, not the best Indian that I have had but the best takeout! Only thing that I had a concern about was the seasoning. Add salt a little at a time so that you can taste all of the ingredients.  Delivery was quick and prompt, food was hot. Rice was nicely cooked. Braised lamb was nice a tender. Delivery buy was great, happy, even apologized for one of the elevators being down in my building. Will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"GET THE POMFRET!! One of the best dishes here.  Samosas are very fresh, sizzlers add an innovative touch. Everything is extremely flavorful and reasonably priced. Will go back again!"}
{"text":"What a terrific find - and just a week after their official opening! Really terrific Indian cuisine with great customer service and a pristine space.  We started with an order of samosa... two flakey pastries filled with diced potato and green peas with pungent spices, served with a tamarind dipping sauce.  For mains, we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani (which we've had at other restaurants) and Alphonso Chicken (which we'd never heard of before). The biryani was delicious, with chunks of white meat chicken, basmati rice, coriander leaves, and pungent spices. We loved that it had some spicy heat, but it didn't overwhelm our taste buds. And the Alphonso Chicken was chunks of white meat chicken with some strips of mango in a rich, smooth sauce made of ground cashews with spices. It was buttery, mildly nutty, and a good contrast with the spicy heat of the biryani.  We also had plain naan (white flour) and tandoori roti (whole wheat flour).  While we ate in (and we'll be back!), we are delighted to live in their delivery area (free delivery for orders over $30)."}
{"text":"This place is really excellent. it's clean and well-decorated, service is warm and efficient, and the food is awesome and not greasy. The Malabari fish curry is incredible. I've eaten here about 6 times and had take-out/delivery twice - it is consistently great. Grateful to have it in our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and have missed out on this little gem until this evening! we called ahead for a table, and there was lots of room for us.  The dining room is pretty, clean and comfortable. We sat by the window and it's nice to look out and was the buzz of Eglinton. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was friendly and attentive. We went with our two young kids and they loved the food too. I can't wait to go back or order in soon!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've ever had. Restaurant is clean and the staff are great at helping you pick out what to order.  The quality of the food is great and the flavours are amazing!  Excellent food, place, staff and service!  Will definitely be a regular at this place.   Update:  everything I said is true, but ...I recently went and ordered butter chicken. The taste was great *one problem* hardly any chicken, not even one full breast for $12.95 in the plus I kept the sauce (tons of sauce) and made my own the next day.  Very skimpy portion!  Will not order this again."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in the area.   Starting from customer service to delicious food! It's hard to find authentic Indian food but this place nails it !"}
{"text":"The food is good but because of the name I expected more. With the name \"The Great Maratha\" I was thinking that food would be exceptionally good and probably related to Maharashtra. But almost everything is North Indian."}
{"text":"Ordered the butter chicken and the quantity vs price was off. Had it taste delicious I wouldn't mind but my butter chicken was so sweet it was almost like a dessert. Very unfortunate as this location is so close to home and it would be nice to have a place for Indian food whenever the craving hits."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian Food. Excellent service, owner run and managed. A great little spot for indian food in Toronto. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Indian food joints from Toronto has opened a second location near my house, and man is it good.  I've only ordered delivery from here but it has been spectacular and added a much-needed punch of authentic food to the area.  The food is incredibly seasoned and prepared, with fresh herbs, toasted spices and spot-on balances of heat.  Do not miss out on the Bharta or Chicken Biryani, they are so light and flavourful, I can't recommend them enough.  I'm so excited to try more on the menu as so far its been a treat.  I'll stop by the location soon to check out the interior, though the quality and temperature of the delivery we've received thus far make it feel moot.  Rejoice fellow Vaughan Indian food fans!"}
{"text":"Disappointing food. I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo (14.50) and Prawns Masala (17.50).  The prawns came in a very thin tomatoey sauce with some Indian spices thrown in.  The chicken \"Vindaloo\" was not vindaloo. It was just the same sauce that came with the prawns, just with some extra hot spice thrown in.  Total order came to $46.00 with tax, delivery and tip via Foodora  Definitely not worth it. Had better food from most $15 Indian dinner buffets. Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now this year (on a Groupon to make it more affordable) and it is amazing. Genuine Indian food, never too busy surprisingly when we went on Saturday nights so it's like having a personal chef service. Everything made very hot and fresh to order just for us. Hard to go wrong. I have had a couple different meat curries, a dum biryani, pakoras, samosas, and the garlic naan of course. I would suggest this place to anyone who wants to try Indian or loves Indian."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Highly recommended for curry lovers. I ordered the fish curry, butter chicken. They are amazing!!! Must try Indian food."}
{"text":"I am reviewing the poor logic and customer service of this restaurant, not the food. What kind of place only accepts a $60 food credit for 4 people when you have exactly 4 people and not 3 people?   I bought a Groupon for $30 and was planning to use it for dinner. I called the restaurant to make sure that they would honour the Groupon voucher on a Sunday night. The guy who answered explained that we could NOT use it if we were 3 people. We would have to find a 4th person! Or we could use the voucher for 2 people and order extra food!  This is either very poor logic or a scam.  Fine Print from Groupon: \"Limit 1 per person, may buy 3 additional as gifts. Limit 1 per visit. Limit 1 per table. Valid only for option purchased. Dine-in only. Not valid for the lunch special. May be repurchased every 30 days.\"  The fine print does NOT specify that the voucher must be used by 4 people."}
{"text":"I've had take-out from The Great Maratha a few times and it's always been really good. This week I went to the restaurant for the first time and was pleased that the food is consistently good.   Although the construction on Eglinton Avenue (due to the new LRT line) has been a pain in the butt, I was able to find street parking right in front of the restaurant ($2.25 per hour). My friend and I arrived just after 6pm and there was only one other table occupied at the time. The décor is pretty simple, clean & well-presented.  We started off with a cup of Chai tea each and shared an appetizer of Popcorn Chicken Tikka, which was better than I expected. Very lightly battered, perfectly seasoned and served with a delicious green dipping sauce (which I LOVED but can't remember what it was called).  We shared two mains: Tandoori Chicken, which came sizzling on a hot plate, and the Lamb Roganjosh. It wasn't very spicy, but it was still extremely flavourful and the curry was full of tender, lean pieces of lamb. I've been to a few other Indian restaurants in the past, that have filled their curries/stews with what can only be referred to as \"scraps\" - basically hunks of fatty, gristly bits of meat. Not the case here - only good quality meat in this food! We also shared an order of the Lamb Biryani and Garlic Naan, so I ended up with enough food for lunch the next day.   Service was excellent - extremely friendly, efficient and very pleasant all around. I will definitely return here."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've had in a long time. If you're in Vaughan and on the hunt for some really flavourful and authentic tasting dishes check their Woodbridge location ok Weston Road out. Dine in or order take out, their friendly staff will get your meal ready. I'd highly recommend their \"Dinner for Two\" with the Butter Chicken, Beef Khorma and Maratha Kofta. Maybe some Pakora or Samosa for the apps. The Vegetable Pulav is quite tasty by itself, as well. Spices are balanced, savoury and sweet. Not too spicy (heat) and not too greasy. We will order from this place again and again."}
{"text":"Please note that this is not a review of the food itself but the service. I called and ordered food to be delivered around 9PM. The person who answered the phone was professional and he even accommodated my request to waive the 30$ minimum order since it was just me for dinner and I didn't want to order food that would go waste. But they were also going to charge me a 5$ delivery fee since my location was outside their usual delivery area. He mentioned that it would be delivered in about an hour.   Around 10:30PM i get a call from the restaurant that the delivery guy is waiting downstairs and he couldnt find parking so i have to go to the street and pick it up. I was fine with this as I am located in downtown and parking could be a problem (though the hotel lobby allows short term parking for deliveries.. but its understandable if the delivery person couldnt figure it out). I go down and look on all streets around the hotel and still couldnt find a car that was described to me. I call the restaurant again and let them know that i am waiting under the big sign of the hotel name on the street and i have not seen a car matching the description. I had been waiting for about 10 minutes by now. THe guy says the driver is having issues calling my phone, which i couldn't understand since the restaurant had no trouble calling the number.   I wait for 10 more minutes on the street. At this point i was starving (it was almost 11PM.. 2 hours after the original order) and have been standing on the street for about 20 minutes. I call the restaurant and let them know what i think of their service and tell them to cancel the order as i was going to try to walk around the street to find some place that might still be open. And as I was standing in line to order food from a fast food place, the delivery guy finally calls me (30 mins after he reportedly reached the hotel) and offers a discount for the food. I declined.   Very poor experience."}
{"text":"Found this place via Groupon. I have resisted buying Groupons from restaurants as my experience is that they don't usually turn out well if they need a Groupon to drive traffic.  however this is a second location of a restaurant that exists in Midtown.  Location is at a pretty long plaza with some other fine places to eat just south of Major Mack on Weston. the actual restaurant is quite small and about the size of a small room or large closet. they have a few tables but I imagine no room for more than 10 to 12 dine in with much of the focus I'd imagine on take out.  food and pricing  lots of great selection and great flavours right off the bat. Had the classic butter chicken which was creamy, slightly sweet and savoury with lots of delicious chicken pieces. classic and about $12. Had the Lamb Korma as well and again came away impressed with flavour for about $14.  Naan and rice as well for under $30. Pay cash and get a 10% discount as well. I'd definitely order take out again and have already picked up a few more Groupons here because the value is great.  Giving it 3.5 out of 4 but rounding up to 4.0 because nothing really wrong with it as take out."}
{"text":"Really great Indian food! The staff is really nice. I would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This is a small and unassuming place but the food is good, reasonably priced with good serving size. The decor is spartan / it is barely more than a takekout space with some seating. We ordered pakoras, and spicy cauliflower for appetizers. In addition, for the mains we ordered malai kofta and mixed veg. Appetizers around 6-7 dollars, veggie mains for 10-12, naans for under 3, pulav under 4. All items were flavourful and tasteful. The service is rather basic but probably expected given the price point. In future I'll probably make this a takeout spot or if we are in the Canada's wonderland neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A good find in midtown TO.  Went with a group of 16 with adults and children. All loved the food ambience and friendly service.  Some great dishes for both the meat eaters and the vegetarians!  The Fish pomfret fry was unbelievable!  Went down with some cold beer! The main dishes were all unique and super flavourful.  Surprisingly none of the dishes were oily but flavour wasn't comprised!   A must eat if you are a connoisseur of good quality Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"The server here is so nice! Do yourself a favour and get the mango lassi. Super thick and yogurty. Very tasty :) I almost left a review after drinking just that.  The wait is kind of long for the food but it's worth the wait. Maybe it's also because we only ordered mains and no appetizers. Anyway, it was hot and fresh out the kitchen."}
{"text":"I ordered from here one night through Just-Eat after reading the awesome reviews on Yelp. The dish I ordered was the Vegetable Manchurian described as \"pieces of paneer, mushroom, cauliflower batter fried and cooked in Manchurian Sauce\". What I received contained 1 PIECE of paneer cheese, no mushroom, and loads of mixed vegetables (the kind that are clearly frozen and contain peas, carrot, and corn) in an extremely salty sauce.  For over $21 after taxes (including rice and naan), this was not an appetizing meal and was not even close to what was advertised on the menu."}
{"text":"We ordered the popcorn chicken tikka, saag paneer, chicken vindaloo, and lamb, along with garlic naan and potato kulcha. Food came out quickly and tasted amazing. The server was attentive and friendly. They also have a good selection of wine and liquor, and a separate dessert menu with dishes you wouldnt expect at an Indian restaurant (I recommend the sizzling brownie). Overall, it was great. Ps. Be careful when asking for the chicken vindaloo to be spicy. It's WAY spicier than you would think."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout alphanso chicken with rice and garlic naan bread for dinner. The dishes were very good.   The people who works there are very nice. There isn't that many diners in the restaurant, so they serve mostly takeout and delivery orders.  Would I go back? Yes. The alphanso chicken is very tasty. I have ordered it several times before and it is delicious."}
{"text":"This place has replaced the Indian restaurant, Cloves the Spice. They have updated the interior décor and it is now quite lovely inside. Definitely a nice place for dining out or take out.  The food is decent, however I can only speak to the vegetarian dishes. I really wish the eggplant one was bigger!"}
{"text":"Ate here today with my partner after we got a groupon! The groupon was $18, for $30 worth of food and we are very happy with what we got. The service was really great. The gentleman at the front who helped us was very kind and polite.  Our food tasted just as amazing. The naans were crispy (how I prefer them) and the butter chicken was probably one of the best butter chickens I've had in a long time.  But my favourite taste was this mint chutney that came with this dish called, \"papad.\"  My partner and I have ate a lot of indian food our entire lives being of indian heritage and we both agreed we will be coming back here often. For the record, we got butter chicken, garlic naan, basmati rice, raita, mango lassi, and papad.  Highly recommend everything we ordered.  Do not be afraid to give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Felt like we had dinner at home! We are a family of 9, we were all seated together and had each dish on the menu. I highly recommend the lamb shank, the naan, the eggplant and chickpeas. Not to mention the amount of food we had.  Recommend for big groups!"}
{"text":"Three of us popped in for dinner on a Friday night for a friends birthday. It's easy to miss the restaurant, as it's in a plaza on the west side of Weston Road and its not big.....I think it could hold maybe 16 people dining in. Anyways, as there's really no Indian restaurants in the neighbourhood we were thrilled to see one finally arriving. Our server was fantastic. As we were unsure of portion size, we told him what we were thinking of ordering and he laughed and told us that it was a lot of food. While the portion sizes here aren't huge, it's more quality vs quantity, but all 3 of us left stuffed. After perusing the menu, we ordered:   * Samosa (2 per serving, but they were large). They were probably the weakest item we had...not a lot of flavour, but they were stuffed with potatoes and green peas. The tamarind chutney was sweet and a good accompianent.  * Chicken Tikka Masala - it wasn't very spicy, although we were told it was \"medium\" heat. For some, it might be considered warmish...but all 3 of us liked heat and were a bit disappointed. The quality and flavours were spot on, just needed to be picked up a notch. Next time We'll ask for it to be spicier.  * Chicken Vindaloo - excellent. Spicy, rich flavours...best dish of the night  * Aloo Gobi - I really enjoyed this dish and I'm usually not a fan of cauliflower.  The potatoes were soft and the sauce was lovely,  * Chana Masala - the chick peas were a little firmer than I like, but it was rich in flavour and we devoured it.  * Naan - crunchy, home made...excellent.  * Basmati rice - light and fluffy.  Our order, with a pop, came to just over $60, tax in. So..it's not overpriced as some say....and we left stuffed and happy.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Such great service. You need to come here for great Indian. They are so kind and the food is always amazing. Get the lassi."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I tried the Prawns Masala and Samosa. They were made as real as Indian food gets.  The mango Lasi is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Curries are amazing, pakoras are a little doughey! I just wish they had combos. I can't eat here by myself, probably by design,"}
{"text":"Taste was ok but portion size is very small.  I bought a groupon to try to this place out to see if it could become a regular spot for my husband and I.  NOT.  We both ordered butter chicken.  I prefer butter chicken when they use dark meat as opposed to chicken breast (which tends to be very dry). We did like the taste of the sauce, but the portion sizes were small.  We would not pay the menu price for such small portions.  I'm female, I weight 120 lbs, and I'm not a large eater but the portion wasn't enough for me, much less my husband."}
