{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5. 

After having been to numerous AYCE sushi places in Mississauga, I can say that while this joint is good, it is not one of the best ones.  

The sushi was mediocre bordering good. I think the nigri was better than the maki though.  However they do have a lot more variety, and unlimited drinks! That's definitely a plus!

The service was also good, the food was coming out fast and without any hindrances. 

To be honest though, instead of going her again, I would prefer to visit heart sushi or Prince Sushi. 

Overall, it's a good place to try, especially if you like AYCE sushi! Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! A 20% off grand opening flyer in the mail got us attracted to give this joint a try but what a mistake we made! This is a newly opened chain in Mississauga but they really have a way to make sure their customers don't come back! 

This restaurant has both Sushi and Teppanyaki sections and we were there for Teppanyaki tonight. Because of the lack of choice in Mississauga therefore this new restaurant attracted a lot of first time customers including us. For a Tuesday night this place was a full-house with customers waiting in line at the reception. After sitting down at the Teppanyaki station (they have 3 which is the biggest in Mississauga), I initially observed that their chefs (more like inexperienced cooks) had to run around borrowing other station's cook top cover (you know the kind they use to make sure the shell fish is cooked). Did the owner forget to order enough or did someone just steal them? Then we noticed the place was warm and felt like it did not have enough ventilation. This I really hate because at the end of a typical Teppanyaki meal like this my clothes would wreak. Also when we sat down at our table there was already a cook making lobster dishes for customers of the sushi section.  This shows that their kitchen internally is lacking Teppanyaki cooktops and their chefs has to do this out at a customer Teppanyaki station - really not good for a dining experience when I saw this.  Finally we got to order the specials they have on their menu and the drama happened. Chef \"Michael-Yama\" came out and had no clue what we and 2 other families ordered. He kept checking the order sheets, yelling what was going on with our orders, rudely interrogating us for what we have ordered, and then told us he did not have what he needed to make all our food. We repeatedly told him what we ordered 3 times and he still complained and kind of threatened us that our food was going to be delayed because he only had enough to make other 2 families' meals.  Shouldn't you be double checking with your fellow waiters to make sure you brought out exactly what we ordered from the kitchen?  Finally the boss came out and told him what everyone ordered and how the food was distributed.  What a logistical nightmare.

Then there was his culinary skill (or lack of).  There was no Teppanyaki flavours on anything he made.  It was like food made on a very hot frying pan, from the vegetables to the meat.  We ordered medium for our steak and it was well done.  You can tell he was not trained properly because he lacks those fancy Teppanyaki hand skills and Japanese chef etiquette.  The entire table was a mess when he finished, and he left the cook top on without cleaning it at all.  Was today like his first day on the job or something? In addition, everything he made was extremely greasy.  He tried doing the volcano thing and boy did he ever butcher it.  It was a disaster!  He is the worst chef of them all in this place and in fact the worst Teppanyaki chef I've ever seen.  If you see this guy at your table, run!  We were there treating someone fairwell, and man what a terrible and embarassing experience.  I'm sure this will make a lasting impression for a long time."}
{"text":"If you are a sushi lover this is the place for you!
The quality of the sushi/sashimi is superb! Their meats are all fresh! None of the food tasted like it had been waiting to come out of the freezer for weeks.

The teppanyaki was ok, a little long to get the food out and only 2 tricks in this visit. There is a bit of a language barrier between patron and server but if you are lucky and the manager notices, he will help you out!

The pricing on the food is very good on your pocket, especially if you have cash (hint, hint)

My advice, do the takeout if you don't want to have a server who only understands the basics of English. If you can stand the English barrier you will eat the best meal you've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Decided to go here today for lunch after they switched their menu to all you can eat and I was highly disappointed. To start off, we did get greeted to our table right away however they did not ask if we wanted tea, water or anything to drink we had to ask them. Another thing was the staff here seem mad when you ask them for something. Overall food is sub par, service is terrible. Would not recommend going."}
{"text":"Great value for lunch all you can eat. Good food and they have added more staff now food comes at normal speed"}
{"text":"Great value!  Went here for mother's day lunch and the lunch combos offered soup, salad, rice, then 2 of the following chicken/steak/cod/beef ribs, mixed veggies and dessert for no more than $12!"}
{"text":"Their bento boxes are good! Such a good price for the amount of food that you get. I was so surprised! The food was alright, but I think that quantitiy satisfied my stomach last night and I was hungry.

The servers were super attentive and really polite and efficient. 

There's also a location close to my work, and we've had take out from there several times and the quality of food is mediocre. But I will return due to the price."}
{"text":"I go here every day for lunch and I have to say I love the staff, they are all very sweet and friendly and they always make us feel welcome, the food is very fresh and delicious, the d√©cor is gorgeous I feel like I'm in an upscale restaurant which is great, the bathrooms are spotless and that makes me feel good because people always say you can tell how clean a place is based on the cleanliness of their restrooms. 
The only downside to this place is their take out service, I get take out from here often because its close to my home and they offer free delivery if its over $25, I find that the tempura sauce they gave me was smelly and something was wrong with it, I don't know if it was old or if it was made improperly, it just grossed my friends and I out. and I don't know if they send a different delivery guy each time or if I just didn't recognize him but usually he's very sweet and very polite but there was one time when our food took awhile to come so we were angry and we didn't want to tip, so we didn't tip him and he had the balls to come back and knock and the door and be like, \"TIP TIP TIP\" we were all alittle annoyed because our food came so late we didn't feel like we should tip but we gave him $10 anyways, I was just surprised that he did that, Ive never heard of that before.

SO LSDR : eat there, don't get take out 

AT THE RESTURANT : 
food = 5/5
service = 5/5
cleanliness = 5/5

TAKE OUT ORDER:
food = 3/5
service = 2.5/5"}
{"text":"They only offer 3 types of maki rolls: California, Salmon, and Tuna. I like having the option to choose from a wide variety, so I thought this was kinda ridiculous.

I ordered a bento dinner which included 6 pieces of sushi, tempura, beef, rice, veggies and ice cream all for around $15.00. Overall, the food was okay and have nothing spectacular to report.

The service needs alot of work though and it kinda destroyed any chance of us enjoying our dinner."}
{"text":"On a Friday this past November I decided to have my birthday dinner at Tako Sushi. There were 16 people in total in my party. We opted for the Teppenyaki table since it was a special occasion. I'm happy to say that the evening surpassed my expectations thanks to the wonderful staff. First of all, I must have called them 3 or 4 times the week prior to change my reservation as the number of people in my party kept increasing. Sometimes restaurants get upset when you change reservations close to the actual date, but these guys were always accommodating. Also I did NOT have to pay a deposit to hold the reservation. The food was amazing. Everyone in my party agrees that the salmon was spectacular. There was also a beef (or pork) rice dish near the end that was absolutely delicious. The staff were very friendly and provided us with just the right amount of service. They were there when we needed them, but they didn't \"hover\", nor did they get upset when we lounged for a while after our meal. The chef who cooked for us at our table was a fun guy and very entertaining to watch. The restaurant itself is decorated very nicely, very chic and elegant but not stuffy or intimidating. It's the kind of place where you would feel comfortable regardless if you were dressed up or dressed casually. One of my concerns going in was that we would all be sitting far apart from one another and no one in my party would get a chance to talk to each other, but this was not the case. We were able to move around and lounge around the table. By the end of the evening we felt right at home! Organizing a large dinner party like this was a nerve wracking experience but I'm extremely thrilled with how everything turned out. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is considering hosting an event there."}
{"text":"Don't get the TAK-OUT sushi platters!  I ordered the large sushi party to go for a get together and  for $67.00 it was not good.  Surf clam and that fake crab stuff covered half the platter-puhlease!  The rolls weren't great at all, pretty small and the california rolls were coming undone as we plated them.  t least full.  

On the other hand, I've had the Teppanyaki and it was quite entertaining and a lot of food for the money. I think they hit you over the head with copious amounts of food so that you feel like the value is there even though the quality may not be top notch.

So either way you'll have filled your belly but I'd still say avoid the TAK-OUT sushi."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I've only tried Teppanyaki here so my review may be slightly biased. In addition, it was my first time trying Teppanyaki ever!

The restaurant is much bigger than what it seems like from the parking lot, and is decently styled to look half modern half traditional (love that kinda feel). I heard this place was usually busy and it is, but even still I was seated almost right away. Now, Teppanyaki there simply made me completely satisfied. You know those times where you had a decent meal, but you leave without your stomach full? Didn't happen here. For the price range of the Teppanyaki and what you get from it, it is so worth it. For the average dinner teppanyaki set, you get miso soup, sushi, shrimp, (choice of chicken beef or fish), rice, and veggies, all for just under 20 after taxes. Lunch is roughly the same but without the shrimp and for cheaper too! Food is made right in front of you by a professional cook, and I don't know why everyone said their cook didn't do any tricks, but both times I went for Teppanyaki, both chefs did the onion volcano trick where they put layers of onions on top of each other to look like a mountain, pour oil on the top and then light it on fire. Pretty flashy! The food tasted very rich in flavour, slightly on the oily side (to be expected...), but tasty and in decent proportion.

As everyone has been saying, service isn't the best in the world. Don't come here expecting a phenomenal service meal. The servers generally do an okay job, but you can tell that the general level of training could be improved. The last time I went there, the manager was training one server how to wipe the tables.... seriously? The servers are also asian, so expect some engrish too. 

I can see the reviews really vary for this restaurant, but for myself, this place is definitely on the higher side of restaurants to enjoy. I think the reason for the difference is because some people go in restaurants prioritizing service over food, which is not a bad thing. Service is important no doubt, but at the end of the day, as long as service is make-doable, you should let food be the deciding factor of whether you come here again."}
{"text":"Sushi & then some. 
p.s Patio is now open here. 

Don't come here for the service. Come here for the fresh FRESH FRESH maki. 
The California roll has fish eggs rolled inside (when did fish eggs become a standard garnish option...what happened to good ol' parsley?) 
the avocado roll is so fresh. ( I can't  stop stressing how fresh everything is)
The spicy salmon is amazing. I'm very picky with raw meat and this just made me run to the alter..agreeingly. 

Confessional fun fact: I've always called myself a fake sushi eater. Which is true. I'm very much into the western concoction of \"sushi\". I'm fine with this. I understand how annoying it is for real sushi eaters. I do. I get scolded on it way more than I'd like. -_-    just remember, we need love too. 
So, my sushi reviews are strictly for my fellow fake sushi lovers. Unite! Fret not real sushi lovers. I still got's love for Yewwww! 
*I assure you, I do NOT pretend to know sushi*


Anywhoo, (pardon that tangent)

The bill comes up a bit higher than average, but still pretty decent. A maki roll is $5.99

if you like things on the side, be prepared to repeat it a few times. Whatever, you get good food. 

order:
California maki roll x2 -  amazing. I can eat this all day long. Fresh! Fresh! Fresh!
spicy salmon maki roll - really superb. The sauce doesn't go all over the place. The concentration of the salmon is so little. Which is probs why I didn't oppose the raw idea. 
sweet potato tempura maki roll - wow. This was gonzo. In minutes. 
Gyoza - This was different from other places. It's fried a ton more and had a crispy brown outside. Normally it's quite light. I'm going to guess and say normally it's boiled and this time it was fried. (I repeat, guess) - here's a random question... is Gyoza by default pork or beef? I know you can have the option of both but I'd like to know how it comes standard. 

4 maki rolls with gyoza came up to $27.00. 
I'm upset there was no extra side stuff and the staff didn't speak much English. Also, forgot my side sauce. Boo urns. 
Come here if you want good sushi & need little to no assistance from staff. 

xoxo

{"text":"Have been here before for their Teppanyaki and it was delicious. The portion sizes are great and the service at the Teppanyaki was friendly. 

However, they have started with an AYCE and decided to give that a try. After being seated we waited 20. No one came to say hello, offered us a drink or take our order. Other tables were being served that arrived after us and received drinks and their orders taken. We were the forgotten table. We were hungry, fed up and left. 

Never Again!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. It's one of the few places in Toronto that serve sushi a la cart instead of AYCE. That being said and factoring in the quality of sushi in Toronto, this place barely met my expectations.

I had a Chirashi bowl, some salmon sashimi and some tuna maki. The plating was a bit lacking, as it was just simply sushi on a white glass plate. In general, the fish was as I expected it to be for sushi in Toronto; not that fresh, and hence lacking flavour. On top of that, the sashimi I had was not well sliced; I found a couple of bones and what looked like a scale in my sashimi, which was a bit disappointing. The rice was satisfactory as well; I felt like there wasn't enough vinegar in the rice to complement the fish.

Overall, it was an average meal. It was convenient and fairly inexpensive, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to go to this place for sushi alone. (There's also teppanyaki, which I'd try if I were to return for another meal.)"}
{"text":"What can I say... It is a good place and I have been here several times with my co-workers at lunch time. The service is fast and the chef is great fun. The food portion and taste is great and the lunch price is amazing."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this restaurant on Saturday but was unable to do so because it was closed by the landlord due to non payment of rent. The location looks good and some of the pictures of the interior were encouraging. I assume that a well managed restaurant in this location should do well. Obviously, I will have to await a new owner before I can eat here."}
{"text":"I joined yelp just to rate this restaurant.

This is easily my favourite restaurant in the GTA.

I mainly order sushi and maki rolls and compared to the other 18 sushi places i have tried, tako is easily the best.

The sushi is extremely fresh, quite large, and the rice is not very starchy giving it a much lighter feeling making it easy to eat a lot of sushi.

I find the service to be very good considering how busy it is although it is not overly friendy/chatty if that's what you're looking for.

I think if you give it a try and rate this place on the sushi, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"This location is close to my area. I often order take out sushi combos. I had forgotten why I only get take out here. Now I remember why. 

Dine-in experience:
My order was mistaken for another person's meal at my table. The waiter brought the food in and called the order by a wrong name, which was in fact my meal. We realized the mistake when the person's actual order was brought to the table. The waiter expected me to continue eating the leftovers of my order although he had mixed it up. Not impressed. We called management and then the waiter and manager spoke in a different language in front of us. Very rude. After getting this sorted out, I was offered a new dish. Which was missing several items. We had to bring their attention to this numerous times. 

The sushi is average. Nothing special. Don't go out your way to get bad service. Take out is best to avoid this type of dine in experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant brings out good tastes, atmosphere and cost very little to get full. It's usually busy during dinner and lunch time but it adds to the atmosphere. The teppanyaki tables are really fun as we'll. 

Unfortunately after eating here for awhile the good gets a little bland and you realize how much sauce they use to give flavour to the food(except sushi of course)

My verdict; the food is good... Once in awhile, the atmosphere is inviting and lively, and the price is just right ;)"}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good but the service is always bad. The waitress always pretend they don't speak Chinese even they know my family is speaking Chinese; the horrible part is they speak terrible English. I saw all the customers who speak English are having troubles communicating with the waitress. 

Having said that, we visited again because of the better food. But this time, the service was even worse. We (4 of us) sat down on a table and waited more than 15 mins, no one gave us tea or tried to greet us. When we try to wave at the waitress, they just avoid the eye contact and ignored us. So we decided to leave, on our way out I went to the Manager and told him we will never come back again. The Manager gave me a look kind of saying\"do I look like I care?\"

I strongly recommend that do not bring your friends or your boss or someone important to this restaurant if you don't want to be embarrassed. 

Good luck if you decide to take the risk!"}
{"text":"Wow, this last guy wrote a novel for a review! But I think he's pretty off-base and, at the risk of being somewhat off-topic, let me tell you why. Long story short, I liked the food here. I thought it tasted great and they did very well considering how extremely busy it was. They did forget an appetizer I ordered but when I reminded them about it, they apologized and gave it to me on the house. And it's pretty inexpensive too. Hey, what more can you ask for? I'll definitely be back for a return visit. 

Now after reading Mike C.'s review I just have to address some points. He says first thing there is a wait in line. This is very true right now. They are extremely busy at this time in their opening and it helps to have a little patience. I asked the server about the business and they said that they were not expecting such incredibly high volume. I can see why. I've never even been to a newly opened restaurant in downtown Toronto this busy. I really wanted to try this place so I didn't mind the wait but I think it can cloud many impatient peoples' initial opinion of the place. If you have read the rest of his review, he then goes on to basically criticize EVERY aspect of their operation. How can you criticize that one cook needed to borrow a piece of equipment from another section or assume that they have not enough cooktops \"internally\"? Are you serious!? They just opened and IT'S BUSY!! They will get more equipment now that they see how busy it is. I also experienced nothing like the \"drama\" he describes going on between workers and chefs and certainly no one came out to yell at me when I said we were missing an appetizer. As I said above, they brought it out to me on the house. Also, we thought the skill of the chefs here are just fine. I had no problems whatsoever with the quality of the food. It looked good and was very tasty.

Now, I gotta say, I have lived and worked many years in restaurants in Toronto and have recently moved to Mississauga and have found that MANY customers are like this here. It wasn't like this in Toronto. They go into the place expecting to be treated like its 5-star dining, looking for the worst in the place and complaining about every little thing. I've never experienced the level of nonsense complaints in all my years until now. This seems to be the typical Mississauga restaurant patron. And, honestly, if you're one too, then you will have a bad experience so why bother? Sorry for the rant but if you give this place a genuine, honest chance without nitpicking every little detail, I think you will be pleased. I certainly was."}
{"text":"I have dined here Teppan twice, a la carte twice.
The teppan is very well priced and great food but the chef's are tired. Understandable. There is not the same type of showmanship you can get elsewhere but they are good chefs.
A la carte sushi is great. Pot of soup is huge and delicious.
This is a local place that does well. Service was on point and very attentive last time I came here."}
{"text":"I love their food here, but it is sometimes a little too oily. They have a stone table where they cook in front of you. I always enjoy their performance at the stone table. This place is pretty pricy."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate, because their food is pretty good and has a good price point.  My last review commented on how the service was okay, but I'm taking this back based on a disappointing experience today. 

On their menu they say Noodles (Udon+Soba). There is actually no explicit dish that as Soba noodles in it. There is one with Ramen noodles (called Ramen). 
So I asked if I can get the Mushroom Noodles, with Soba noodles. 
The server didn't seem to understand me and said, \"yes, there is soup\". I said that I wanted to have different kind of noodles, Soba instead of Udon. 
She points to the Ramen noodles, and I said No, I want Soba noodles. She then nodded and went away. I also wanted an Egg in my noodles. 

When she finally came with my noodles, it was Ramen noodles. I wasn't pleased. I have a wheat sensitivity, and didn't want to have Ramen noodles and wanted the buckwheat ones.  I called her over and said, this is not Soba noodles.  She didn't seem to know what Soba noodles were, and I said, I want the brown colour noodles. 
She said they did have that, and I had to explain to her the brown colour noodles were Soba noodles. 
She said she would bring me a new one, but instead called the manager over. 
I was pleased that when I explained it to him, he knew and it was clear to him what happened. But no apology was given. 

I got a new noodles, after an extra 10 mins wait. 
but they still charged me for the extra egg and offered no apology. 

So many things wrong....

a) employees need to be trained on the different noodles
b) the menu needs to be changed to show that the choice is available
c) it was completely unprofessional to have a server who has no idea what the difference between soba, udon, and ramen was, nor that she didn't understand english. she didn't have to give me a dirty look when asking for subsitutions
 - even if she didn't know, she could have pretended, and then wrote it down and told the chef. I am sure the chef knows. 
d) change was not offered on our $17 bill (gave them a $20)
e) i dropped my credit card, and they took it, then brought it back 10 mins later telling me cash only. 


All of this was just too much, and I was too tired to make a fuss about it."}
{"text":"Well I think that my review won't differ from the division that exists eating at Tako Sushi. 

You either love it or you hate it...strongly. 

I fall into the category of the person who loves the food and can't stand the staff. 

As far as variety, freshness I think Tako Sushi rates highly for me considering some of the other AYCE (All You Can Eat) places I have ventured to over the past. 

The problem, has and will continue to be the staff (not including the chef's) 

I literally have eaten at this location EVERY FRIDAY like clockwork for the previous 3 years. I always order ahead...ALWAYS as Friday seating that place reminds me of a 50% sale at Michael Kors...so yes a tad busy. 

No matter who answers the phone, they struggle with taking the order which hasn't changed in the previous 3 years. I mean I even call approximately the same time...between 4-5pm. To even get a greeting as a 'regular' person is that asking for too much? 

That aside every year I always have a group of friends come out for Teppanyaki style dinner, and the service I receive those times always makes me wonder why I don't eat in more often. The chef's are ALL hilarious whether they are singing or making knock jokes, or even performing tricks with the food as requested. 

Personally I feel you need a system to eat here...yes the AYCE is still new and they are still working out a system...so it appears that most people will claim food that is brought to the table even if it's not their's...resulting in the salty reviews of others that claim they don't get their food. Personally when I haven't seen my food in 10 minutes (avg cooking time) I grab someone to inquire what's going on. Food always comes afterwards. 

As far as the staff is concerned you are being fed... you almost need to be forceful when doing AYCE...you know speak up? some people i have seen are content to stew and complain but when the staff come to ask if all is well...they say yes and smile. I've never understood the point of that this isn't about being polite or even politically correct if you have a problem with the service, or if you haven't gotten your food...THEN you say something. It only makes sense to me..but that is just me."}
{"text":"Well... I went back, this time for dinner, and unfortunately I was less than satisfied. I ordered miso soup and 3 rolls (Cali, Alaska, & Fotomaki). The rolls took 30 minutes to arrive - and the place was NOT busy - then the taste was not very fresh. Hmmm. Also much more pricy at dinner. Cost of 3 rolls, miso soup, and green tea = $26 and change, before tip. Service was lacking too. I might come back to give Tako one more shot but it won't be for a while."}
{"text":"I've been to Tako sushi a few times, and I generally enjoy myself. It's not anything fantastic or special, but there is high turnaround and a steady flow of customers, so one can probably assume the fish is relatively fresh. The prices are good for what it is, and coming from a place where sushi is $$$, this is always a treat. And the selection is awesome - perhaps not necessarily the types of rolls (average, I'd say), but lots of non-sushi items that are excellent.

I'd have to agree with the previous reviewers that the service is not stellar; like most Chinese-run sushi restaurants, it takes some effort to flag down someone for more tea or your bill. It's definitely an efficient no-nonsense type environment, where the servers are curt in taking your order or bringing you food, without spending too much time pampering and sweet talking for a bigger tip. Personally, I don't mind this (I'm here to fill my belly with sushi, not get asked 100 times how the food is), but I suppose some people might find this poor service. 

Don't expect to get your palate tickled by high-end Japanese delicacies. But if you're hungry for some satisfying tasty food, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday. 

The staff there was okay, some of the waiters were pretty rude. But there was one really cute waiter who spoke to us, so he kind of made up for it heh. 

The food here was okay, we mostly had all the sushi they had to offer to us and the ice cream.

Would probably go back here again."}
{"text":"Lots of Japanese people eat here, extensive menu beyond sushi/sashimi. 

This is more like a \"white guy Sushi\" place, though.  Big and busy, franchised feel. If you're looking for something more authentic, keep looking."}
{"text":"Usually come here for dinners with my family.  Affordable and tasty sushis.  My parents like getting the special combo deals and we usually only have to order 2 for the 3 of us because they give large portions.  Very friendly service.  Plus ice cream for dessert besides the boring fruit they give at other places in town."}
{"text":"The chefs are nice...but the service otherwise was HORRENDOUS. We had a table reserved for 11 people but 12 showed up and the servers decided to make us feel like shit for it the ENTIRE dinner. As if the extra seat was SUCH a hassle to them. What difference does ONE seat make? On top of that, I ordered the muscle soup, and 2 out of 3 of my muscles were closed and inedible, but they refused to do anything about it. 
This place doesn't deserve your money, go to a REAL teppanyaki  place somewhere downtown. You are better off."}
{"text":"Tako sushi was my \"go to\" place when I meet up with my cousin. Usually, service isn't perfect, but today was just downright awful. 

They recently implemented an All You Can Eat menu, which we were excited to try cause it looked very promising.  

When we came in, we were immediately greeted and seated (this was at 8pm). We looked at the menu for a bit and placed our first order. It was 3 hot dishes from the kitchen and rest were from the sushi bar. Hot food came out within 15-20 minutes, we finished it and we just assumed that the sushi was going to come eventually; 30 minutes passed. We asked the server where our orders were, she seemed a little confused and went to check. She came back and said it's coming. No food came. So we just ordered more and ordered the same dishes again in hopes of it actually arriving. This time 3 dishes out of 8 arrive. We asked the server again for the rest of our food, she said that it all came out already. We were slightly irritated at this point and we placed our FINAL order. This time once again, less than half of the food arrived.
We were sitting there patiently waiting for the rest of our food to HOPEFULLY arrive. The server then approaches us at 9:25pm to tell us, \"Last call\". I believe MOST AYCE places give the last call about half an hour before. 

At this point, we were fed up. We tried to get someones attention. But every time, they held up there hand from a far to signal that they'll come. But they don't. At this point, our server disappeared. 

When we finally got the managers attention, we told him what the situation was (how half of our food never arrived, our server wasn't around, no one came by our table till we flagged down servers multiple times). He said that he would go, \"check to see what happened to our orders\". He disappeared for 15 minutes. We ask him again what the status of everything was, once again, he said he'd be back. Another 20 minutes pass. We told the manager that we weren't happy with how tonights dinner went and that we don't think we should be paying full price for the lack of service. He said he'd give us 10% off. My friend said that 10% off will not compensate for what happened tonight. ***RIGHT OFF THE BAT, the manager then threatens us, \"You don't want to pay? I'll call the cops on you.\"    At this point, the manager wasn't willing to listen to us anymore. He keep on saying he's going to call the cops on us. 

I have worked in the restaurant industry before, and my previous managers have NEVER treated a customer like this. 
I will never be coming back to this establishment ever again - not unless they do something about management and how they train their employees. Cause tonight was an absolute disaster."}
{"text":"The sushi here is okay-ish. Not terrible, but not great. The restaurant space itself, however, is something to rave about.The interior is absolutely beautiful. I love the ambiance here. It's like walking into a 5 star restaurant. 

Another great thing about this restaurant is that they have a large menu with various combinations (Teppanyaki). Their appetizer selection is also pretty unique. In general, this is a good place for sushi, but not as good as Sushi One, which isn't too far away."}
{"text":"They have since converted their menu to AYCE plus Teppanyaki. I think they are still adapting to the switch. Be aware, on Google, there is a group of stupid people giving a 1-Star rating. Their reason for it? Only half of their AYCE order came out, so they should only be required to pay half. How stupid can people be? They complained that the restaurant is evil for treating them as criminals....because they are.

Anyway, we came here for a belated Mother's Day Dinner, and the seven of us all orders the Lobster Special for 1 (we have to pay $7.95 extra of course).
The starter salad is a little on the spicy side, but many will find it just right. The sushi app is alright. The lobster is decent size, and fairly fresh. The salmon sashimi salad was heavenly
For the main course, our chef cooked the salmon perfectly. The oyster was done to perfection: crispy on the outside, still very moist on the inside.
The rack of lamb was done to order to the tee. Loving it! The same go for the steak.
The poor chef was cooking the vegetable and fried rice for 11. While the vegetable turns out great, but the fired rice...well, you know it is not going to be easy when you saw the mountain, literally, of rice he had to fried on a teppanyaki....There wasn't enough color, smell good, taste good, and look decent.
The meal finish with some really good quality ice cream.

Overall, my wife wants to give 3.5 stars, but I think it deserve the other half, just because their staffs were nice, and the chef cook to the way we wanted (less salt and pepper) without complain...actually, with a smiling face."}
{"text":"Fresh food for the right price and portion size.

I usually order the teriyaki chicken box and Salmon sushimi boat.  More than enough for two ppl plus they provide ice cream dessert at the end.  The sushimi cuts are good cut portions.

Definitely worth trying it out one time."}
{"text":"great value for lunch specials! All the ingredients taste fresh every time! Happy Eating"}
{"text":"Very limited selection of sushi. Every sushi roll contained mayonnaise. Nasty. The presentation of each roll on its own sushi block made no sense for the limited table space. Sushi rolls were also rolled too loosely. While service was generally attentive, we received the wrong sushi roll once (which was quickly corrected) and one of my dining mates got the wrong drink twice. E for effort, I guess."}
{"text":"As usual the cooked food was great and the portions still large as usual. What surprised me is that they've really stepped it up with their sushi! The rolls were very large and filled with fish rather than 80% rice like before. I just hope it isn't the odd chef that makes it like that."}
{"text":"Three stars might just be a bit over the board with Tako Sushi..their food is pretty average, as others said maybe too pricy for what they offer. The sushi is ok but not the best you can get in Mississauga. 
BUT..my biggest disappointment is the take out. I ordered twice the same thing (dinner for two..I stick to what I like:p ) and BOTH TIMES they mixed up my order. I asked to replace the Japanese dumplings with spring rolls (seems uncomplicated to me) and both times I found the damn dumplings when I got home! And I did ask them when I picked it up (the girl at front said \"yes yes, they did\"). I called them to complain and i got 10% off my next order after waiting on hold for few minutes...wow..I am honoured:)
Oh and they charge you 5 cents for the plastic bag!! Hahahaha, what a joke! Next they will charge u for each of the 3 sachets of soy sauce they include and for the chopsticks? Hey maybe my 10% discount will cover that:D I mean... I found it ridiculous. 
I hope they get it together, or they will lose more and more customers. I don't feel like going back to them again..but maybe.."}
{"text":"Lunch AYCE was decent for the price, but not the best I've had. 

Best item on the AYCE menu is definitely the satay chicken and satay beef."}
{"text":"Selection is pretty good for all you can eat buffet, I personally like the chef's recommendations! The seared beef and salmon is good the only thing drawback is that last call is at 9:30 not a a lot of time for a late dinner group."}
{"text":"Decided to have lunch here instead of going to my fave usual sushi place. Everything from the service to the food was top notch!

Me and my sister both got the Dixie sushi lunch with a side of salmon sashimi. The sashimi was fresh and were a nice thick cut (mmmm!). The dynamite and california rolls were fresh and did not fall apart. The service throughout lunch was great! The servers were always attentive and were very nice. You usually don't get this kind of service at asian places.

I think Tako Sushi is going to be my new fave usual place."}
