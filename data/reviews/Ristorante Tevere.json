{"text":"had veal scalopini on the evening specials saturday Dec-17-2011. I'm no chef Ramsey, but would swear the veal was frozen, not cooked fresh and had no taste. Covered with sliced tomatoes and melted cheese. Not recommended, coffee was was of the dish water variety. Very disapointing for a supposedly resturant of this calaber. This type of dish needs updating"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ristorante Tevere (formerly called Place Tevere) all my life. The food is delicious, especially the pizza, and the atmosphere (especially in the old cavern-like room) is a conversation starter.  On your way out, the owner will often hand candy to the kids... perhaps you'll score some Bazooka Joe!  On busy nights they often have a Caribbean duo that play popular songs on their bass, keyboard and steel drums... I suggest you request they play Copacabana (they learned it after I requested it for many many years). Streets of Philadelphia is another classic cover they like to play."}
{"text":"Expensive for pizza and the rest is average. It's just an average delivery place from the west island! And it's Mall food that also has a restaurant location. The pizza crust is on the thin side ever though it's not thin crust.. Lost of cheese and the sauce is pretty ok but more liquid and missing some thickness to it!  Pas mal trop cher pour de la Pizza. C'est une place Bof je dirais. La croûte (par rapport au standard nord-américain) est mince puis il y a bien du fromage. La sauce est un peu ordinaire et un peu trop liquide à mon goût. J'aime une sauce avec plus de texture. C'est de la pizza de centre d'achat qui ont un restaurant qui opère à l'extérieur des centre d'achat. C'est juste que c'est aussi cher que dans les centres d'achat. J'aime juste vraiment mieux la Gigi!"}
