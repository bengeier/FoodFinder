{"text":"Great Shisha, food... Not so great....service.... Mediocre, not usually very busy and I've been there on weekends a where its reserved for private parties...for a fair distance to drive for Shisha... It kinda blew my night :( as I drove a fair distance for good Shisha"}
{"text":"Went with a group from work for lunch. Three of the four chicken shawarma we ordered had hair in it. Could have been in the fourth one too but that one was ice cold.  We all walked out and went to McDonald's!!"}
{"text":"Didn't really like their food. Chicken on a pita is ok actually but the rest no so much. I have had a better falafels and hummus. Waiters are not that friendly either..."}
{"text":"just to let you know we drive all the way from Brampton, just to go to this place whicj is in scarborough. the middle eastern food is awesome, the portions are a good size and the prices are dirt cheap, small swarma dinner for under $8 per person, falafels are good and there hot wings are soooooo hot for $5o bucks four people will be stuffed as they give you free appetizers, hot peppers, beets, olives and pitas. The hummos is to die for,  and the ground beef  kabobs are great... the place is nothing to rave about but the food is great."}
{"text":"Aladdin's Palace is a fairly sizey restaurant, but unfortunately it's pretty hidden away.  Location is everything, but for Aladdin it doesn't seem like they really follow that guideline too tightly. It's located in the basement of the small strip plaza, with no real signage available.  It's also located in a largely asian plaza, which is a little weird. But hey, it works for them.  The food here is pretty good. Portions are pretty filling and with the pita and dip it's more than enough.  I've only gone during lunch, which is pretty quiet (we're usually the only table), but that is better for us because the food is super fresh.. Service is ok, but considering we're the only patrons, I'd expect a little more."}
{"text":"THIS place is actually the WORST food establishment I have ever had the displeasure of going to. The food is PRICEY, it is absolute CRAP, and it should be illegal for such a place to exist. Everything tasted like it came from cans and jars from NoFrills. The meat portions were a joke and of poor quality. The lady that served us was friendly, but this place should not be in business. Whatever you do do NOT go and eat here, avoid this place like the plague."}
