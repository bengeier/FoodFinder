{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner!  The polenta fries are crunchy and the inside creamy. Everything was wonderful and perfect.   My sister keeps talking about the \"Old Fashion\" drink.  Just can't wait to come back to this gem!"}
{"text":"Great drinks.  I don't fancy myself a drinker, but the drinks here are why this place is so highly rated.  The food is of a high caliber as well.  Ordered a cheese board and the pork belly ramen.    The food was good enough for a 3-star rating.  Great menu for a bar.  I recommend this place to go if you plan on drinking with friends.   Order some good food, a couple drinks share some laughs.  I was surprised that this place was not hipster.  Huzzah!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp,  and glad I did.  Had several small plates and bites.  The pork dumplings were delicious!  These are a must have! The crispy brussel sprouts are also a must...delicious and unexpected.  Enjoyed the mussels but the butter sauce was a bit flavorless. The French fries were perfectly done.  Several sauces to choose from. I had the garlic aoli.  They have a good beer menu and a nice specialty cocktail menu,  but I have seen better.  Food and drink aside,  the atmosphere was relaxed and perfect for dining and conversation.  Loved that there is no TV.  Will go back when the weather is nice and the garage doors can be opened."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Unique appetizers. Tried the Rabbit Rillette, Deviled eggs, and the spinach feta dip. Our group all agree, delicious!! We Love the environment."}
{"text":"My friend and I received the exact same fraudulent charge on our credit cards after being at The Summit Saturday evening. We both had the same bartender, as well. Coincidence? I'm gonna say NO! Drink there at your own risk. DISGUSTED."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great drinks, cool atmosphere, and delicious food! They have a really good happy hour too. One of my favorite bars!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this bar one time upon writing this post, but my experience there was so awesome, I'm getting ready to go again here in a few minutes. The atmosphere was very cool. Definitely a bar that you'd see in, perhaps, Lawrenceville, so I think it definitely brings something different to Mt. Washington. The beer selection was fabulous, and the bartenders were very nice and friendly. I agree that a kitchen, when it opens, will make this place even more of a win!"}
{"text":"I came to the Summit for the first time as I was a judge for one of their cocktail competitions. The staff is super friendly! The space is on the smaller side but the bar seating makes up for it. Their happy hour specials are great! I can definitely see myself being a regular here. Great cocktail selection that is well thought out and the ingredients are properly executed!"}
{"text":"The Summit is a fantastic bar and now restaurant. It's small, and the selection is somewhat limited, but it certainly has all the right stuff.    The atmosphere is fantastic. Everything from the music to the lighting is exactly what you would want from a neighborhood high class joint.   The drinks are better than ever. Since opening in 2013 they've made improvements to their classics and added seasonal drinks that are great. Their beer selection has improved as well."}
{"text":"The Summit joins the list of several relatively new upscale yet relaxed gastropub/cocktail bars in Pittsburgh.  I came here with some friends the other night and left satisfied but without any strong urge to make it a regular spot.  We started with a few cocktails on happy hour special (6 bucks 5-7 M-F).  All were quite good and were made with care.  If this review were for those cocktails alone, during happy hour, the review would be a solid 4.5 stars.    We waited about an hour total for a table for 4 to open up.  There wasn't really a system to put your name on a waiting list or anything as there wasn't a host/hostess, so people were pretty much just snagging tables as they become available.  Also, they don't take reservations.  We managed to order a few apps (fries, fried goat cheese balls, and the cheese plate).  All were good, though the cheese plate had only one solid cheese and two soft cheeses.  For entrees we decided to split a few dishes, so I ended up trying the pork belly ramen, the burger, a root vegetable salad, and the green curry chicken wings.  I wasn't a big fan of the ramen as the noodles were somewhat under-cooked and the portion was quite small for the price ($16), the burger and wings were great though.  We saw some other tables get the tacos, which we would have given them a try, but they were sold out by the time we ordered :(  Overall, a good experience, and probably the best option in Mount Washington if you're looking for a trendy place off Grandview.  However, I'd rank them slightly below places like Station, Tender, or Butcher and the Rye."}
{"text":"It's absolutely my favorite bar in the entire city. The coolest atmosphere. They have delightful cocktails. Bartenders are knowledgeable and super friendly. Kitchen open until midnight and they have really really good food. Best Moscow mule and old fashioned in the city"}
{"text":"Tried this place at the suggestion of our daughter and was extremely impressed.  The bartenders are excellent and extremely knowledgeable about their craft which is sometimes hard to find around town.  These guys know what they are doing.  Great selection of cocktails, craft beers on tap, in bottles and cans.  The open air windows is nice to sit during the summer.  No TV's make everyone forced to have a conversation unless you have your nose in your phones. Try this place and enjoy the best bartender's in the city!   Garlic popcorn is also great!"}
{"text":"By far the best Penicillin drink! Cozy and comfortable atmosphere with very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Didn't get into the food but have come back specifically for the drinks!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have always liked the drinks. I tried the beet salad and it was the best I've had."}
{"text":"This bar is constantly receiving recognition in all of the local blogs and publications. And for good reason. All of their delightful cocktails are handcrafted from fresh ingredients right in front of you. The music selection, lighting, decor, ambiance and crowd-favorite board games bring such a great vibe. Everyone is always so calm, cool and collected here. The basement bathrooms were done by a local artist. Name-that-tune trivia is fantastic, as are the happy hour specials. The open-air garage door concept along Shiloh is ideal. The fall decorations are so tasteful and really pull you into the season. This is a fantastic spot run by fantastic people in a fantastic location. I love stopping by for happy hour or a late night cocktail. Well done, mes amis."}
{"text":"Been here a few times last year. Great atmosphere and great staff. Try the Blood and Sand or the Moscow Mule."}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood bar in Mt. Washington!    The Summit is a dimly-lit (a plus in my book) bar that offers an oft-changing (also good!) menu of craft cocktails.  Over the winter, my favorite of these was a spiked hot cider drink.  These guys also make a damn good Manhattan.  If you're looking for a decent selections of bourbons, whiskeys, and ryes, this is also your place.  They usually have some interesting beers and wines on the menu as well, and I was pleased one weekend to learn that they carry Prosecco, too. Yes, you can pop bottles.  There's a shelf with games in case your group wants to play drunk Jenga.    There are a few small tables with chairs, but I think the use of the space is good.  There are soft-cushioned stools at the bar.    I'm a big fan of the owners/men behind the bar, who are friendly and knowledgeable about their drinks.  The usual bouncer is often reading an interesting book at his post.  My only complaint is the music:  it's usually loud hip hop.  For a cool craft-cocktail place with dark atmosphere, the music seems off.  It's hard to hear people talk and it's not like it's a dance club!  But it may just be my personal preference."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR for the WIN! Best happy hour around. $6 strong, crafted, creative drinks. Discounted prices for food. Board games. Garage Doors. Fun atmosphere. You can't go wrong with The Summit during their 5-7PM M-F happy hour!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time and could not wait to try it. Over the summer the windows open up and people look like they are having a blast.  We finally got there last week and it is cute and cozy inside yet trendy.  They do not serve food but a great place to go for a cocktail. I did not think the prices were high and got a draft beer for $5. They had a nice selection of drafts including the pineapple beer from Rivertown-one of my favorites. My date went with a cocktail, an apple cider drink of some sort, slightly more expensive at $9 but worth the price. The music was good, it wasn't too crowded so we were able to get a table around 9:30 on a Friday night and they have board games that you can play at your table."}
{"text":"I have been to The Summit a few times, always for the trivia night.  A few times it has been crowded, but seats eventually open up.  The drink menu provides a lot of choices for both beer and cocktails.  There are specialty cocktails that change fairly frequently.  Pretty much everything that I have ordered has been delicious.  The burger comes out juicy and perfectly cooked.  Interestingly enough, my favorite thing is the popcorn!  It is soooo good.  The browned butter is my favorite.  The Name that Tune trivia is a lot of fun too.    The food, drinks and atmosphere will definitely bring me back again."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the creative drinks they make - whiskey selection is good, and their beer selection is moderate but good choices to pick from (not a bunch of domestic boring beers haha). You can play board games and card games here, and it's open when it's nice out so it's nice and breezy. Great place."}
{"text":"First day in Pittsburgh I was looking for a bar that served good cocktails close to my hotel. The Summit popped on my search and it didnt disappoint. Daniel was our bartender and did a great job executing the drinks. My Gimlet and the Amabel were spot on. Food wise we had the Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese (fantastic) Spinach Artichoke and Crab app (Good). Vibe was awesome and I would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Great staff. Food was incredible. We got Mac and Cheese, Spinach Feta dip, Mussels, and Tacos. The food was so good and four people had plenty to eat with the shareables. They have a great selection of different beers but they won me over with the cocktails. I got a perfect Old Fashioned. The vibe is chill and they even have some board games to play. I would definitely recommend The Summit."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time for a friend's going away party. I loved the atmosphere and closeness of the space with the open glass doors. The staff was attentive and helpful. I enjoyed a French 75 to drink. Others in my party enjoyed the same. I shared French fries with aioli dipping sauce and macaroni and cheese. The fries were so tasty and I loved the dipping sauce. We cleaned the plate. The next appetizer, macaroni and cheese, was very cheesy and filling. I could not eat all of it."}
{"text":"The prices are high, but your definitely paying for quality, the quality of drinks and atmosphere are well worth it. Awesome spot for a group of friends, quiet enough to have a conversation and alive enough not to feel out of place. Also great for a date night, grab a table, and let the cocktail waitress take care of you.  Also, ALWAYS ask what they have special that night, innovative and delicious drinks in the works at all times. Friendly staff and great location"}
{"text":"Wow! What an awesome find this place was! I wasn't feeling the best, and I'm quite sad that I didn't get to fully experience the summit in all its glory. I can't wait to go back and devour their food and cocktail menu.  I would have never expected to find such a trendy spot in the rough-and-tough bar section in Mt. Washington. My friend and I were (rather foolishly) walking around Wednesday night hoping to grab a couple drinks. I don't typically come up here because the bar scene is just not what I'm looking for. After walking up and back Shiloh for a minute, we decided to walk into the Summit because it didn't look intimidating and it was very crowded. That had to be a good sign!  The bar is gorgeous and inviting, with oak accenting throughout. The bar is set to the left and takes up a large portion of the place, but that's okay because the bar is where you want to be here. We found two seats on the end and ordered pretty basic drinks. She had a Tito's cranberry and I had a rum and sprite.  I'm always weary of order specialty cocktails because I either fall in love or I'm so disgusted that I swear off alcohol for a month (hello, Roanoke in Chicago!). Everyone around us seemed to have splurged on a menu item, so next time I come in I'll certainly try it out. We didn't eat much because again, I was not feeling well. The hangover stayed way more past its not-welcomed welcome, and the old adage that you can fix a hangover with more alcohol was not working for me. We had some fries, which were super crispy and seasoned well. I couldn't hang out much longer, which saddened me to the max because I quickly fell in love with the ambiance. They were also playing music trivia. I love trivia!  I can't wait to come back to Pittsburgh next so I can come back and bask in all of the Summit's glory!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place, but based on the name alone, I was looking forward to a visit.   The problem I had with The Summit is that I wasn't sure what kind of place it was trying to be. It had all the looks and feeling of a \"modern\", trendy bar - with garage door walls and cool lights - but it really liked some sort of cohesive atmosphere. The The staff treated us like we were at a dive bar. They pretty much never came back to us unless we hog-tied them and getting a smile and anything less than an awkward shrug seemed difficult. This would've been fine if I were only paying $3-6 for my beer, but I paid $9.  Also, the layout was odd. There was all of this space in the middle that could've been used for more cocktail tables.   Overall, I wouldn't be against going here, but it probably won't be from my own suggestion. If they offered some appetizers or finger foods, then it might be more appealing. I think the service needs to match the look and then it would score a little more."}
{"text":"Came to the Summit for happy hour after my parents told me what a great time they had here. Cons of the Summit: even though it's on Mt Washington, you don't get that overlook view.  Pros on the Summit: the drinks; and Grandview Ave is only a block away if you need to see the city skyline after you have a few. Oh and there are charging outlets right under the bar, what a great feature!   Happy hour is 5-7, during which cocktails are $6! It was a Tuesday, we walked in at 6, and there was plenty of seating. Even though I complained about the lack of view, the space does have a large window open to Shiloh street which is nice when the weather is good.  I had the Amabel and the Sex Tape. If you go and read the descriptions, you'll see that these are pretty close to the same thing (gin, grapefruit), but the Amabel was my favorite."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks and great service!! The Summit is our favorite informal date night spot. My husband  appreciates the craft beer selection and I love the ever changing list of cocktails. The atmosphere is laid back and the bartenders are the best! They also always have great vegetarian options on the menu. Another bonus, they serve water filtered through a Berkey. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this bar since I live pretty close but I was rather disappointed. First off its very small. Limited seating. The cocktails are good but pricey. Me and my friend waited and waited at the bar trying to get a second drink and we couldn't even get a bartender to look our way. Yes it was busy but that was no excuse. We ended up walking across the street to redbeards where we got served immediately. Oh and redbeards has food!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars because I really loved the atmosphere, drinks and the food. The one waitress named Melissa ruined my experience by being extreme rude and pushing me and my friends around the bar instead of walking by and saying \"excuse me\" like any other service person that works there would. While the bar tenders and bar backs were lovely she was extremely rude and should be trained to deal with customers/the public."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim before catching a flight. We let our server know we were slightly pressed on time, and she was awesome about getting our order in quickly. Very large beer selection, I don't typically drink beers and was able to find something I really enjoyed! The food was also great, highly recommend the pork dumplings."}
{"text":"I know, I know, most people come here for the drinks. But my mom and I didn't want drinks--just food in a relatively uncrowded space. The service was friendly and attentive enough given that everyone else in the place at the time was seated at the bar and we were at a table in the corner. My mom got the ribs and really liked them--they were tender and juicy and flavored just right. On the other hand, I made the mistake of ordering their ramen (I know it was silly--who orders ramen from an American bar??). The toppings (kimchi, baby bok choy, mushrooms, and pork) were pretty good, although the pork was not as tender as it should have been. The real issue was that the broth was bland, and the noodles were thin and cheap--the kind you get in instant ramen packs. Come here for the good American food and the drinks (which I hear are good, but I don't know from experience), but definitely avoid any Asian food options they might have on the menu."}
{"text":"This was a nice pick in Mount Washington, distant views on the city but open air inside due to 2 garage doors that rise to bring the outdoors in.  Attractive modern decor.  Nice beer selections, and lots of cocktails.  Solid neighborhood spot. Did not eat here, but I heard people saying good things."}
{"text":"Great little spot with great food. All exterior walls are garage doors and they were open today so it was great.   Food - we just got some apps. Fries, chicken bean dip, and tacos. All were really good, quality dishes. We really enjoyed it.   Drinks - the cocktails were awesome. The bartenders do a great job and are definitely experienced at making some awesome drinks. The Penicillin is amazing.   Bartenders - nice guys. Interacted with guests and made sure everyone was taken care of. We got extra chips without asking.   Overall, awesome spot. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best place to go for handcrafted drinks. The bartenders really know what they're doing. I enjoy the fact that there isn't a tv.  It really helps people communicate more! The board games are a fun addition. Their Mac and cheese is delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails, great beer selection, and great food. The location is fun. Easygoing staff. Take the monongahela incline from the station square area to the Mt. Washington neighborhood. There is absolutely nothing of interest in station square. It is just a bunch of chain garbage, So take the trouble and go up the hill. The Summit is worth it."}
{"text":"The sign outside said \"try and old fashioned at The Summit\".  I did and it was fantastic.  This is my \"go to\" cocktail and theirs is as good as I've had.  Too bad we'd already had dinner because there were a bunch of things on the menu I wanted to try.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I do like this place. A lot. You can sit at the bar or grab a cozy booth. The drinks are very good and their food isn't bad either. The atmosphere is very nice. In the summer, it feels like an enclosed patio due to open windows. Never stuffy, always nice and breezy. In the winter, it's beautiful and decorated nicely for Christmas. I've been here twice and I'll definitely be back. The restroom is a bit different. It's downstairs and the stairs are shallow. Not the place to get a good buzz going and then decide you have to use the restroom."}
{"text":"As I continue to travel, I indulge in random, some times hole in the wall places or more trendy upscale places. The Summit is a great spot for my 4th meal ever in this city. But before I comment on the food. Let's start with the Glogg: a warm mix of cab, port, almonds raisins and a few other details. Wow. On a cold winter day, I can only ask why no other bar/resto serves this. Truly enjoyed this drink..  As for the food menu, it's the perfect size. A few snacks, a few small plates and then some large. I went for the pork dumplings, delicious! The stuffing is well seasoned and the soy sauce come out warm with a slight kick. I could've eating a box!   I finished with some mussels, which were enjoyable. Two details I would change are the chorizo and the toasted bread. The chorizo is not as bold and if it were a nice ground Spanish/Mexican chorizo I think the flavor profile would go along way. And the toast, it would probably be better with buttered/olive oiled French bread rather than sliced white bread..   The. Bartenders were both extremely friendly and welcoming. Explaining the seasonal items and rotating menu. I didn't have any other cocktails, but they all looked great! For a Monday night alone, Tuesday date night, or with friends, be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"On Mount Washington, this place was a bit out of my way but I'm glad I stopped by for their Happy Hour. There's a bar and some tables, and it was pretty busy and loud by the time my friend and I got there around 6. Just as we made our way to the bar, we noticed that one of the tables was being cleaned up. We asked the bartender if we could sit down there, and he told us to go for it. Within a few minutes, a server brought us some water and took our orders. She let us know that we should make our cocktail orders ahead of time, because it can take a bit for them to come out (especially because it was pretty busy).  The real stars of the show here are the cocktails, and you should definitely take advantage of their happy hour deal ($6)! There's most likely a drink for everyone given their extensive menu.   For snacks, we ordered the Cheese Plate and the House Cut Fries off the Happy Hour menu. The Cheese Plate was great, and I loved the candied nuts that came with it. It came with three types of cheese which were all good, but two of them were pretty similar from what I remember. The fries were nice as well, but I think they accidentally gave us the Tomato Chipotle Aioli instead of the Garlic Rosemary one we ordered. Didn't bother me too much because it was still delicious! Would order the fries again next time.  Final tips: Be careful going down the steep stairs to the bathroom (especially after a few drinks)! Also if you haven't already, it's worth checking out the view of downtown Pittsburgh from the nearby overlook."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite spots for a few delicious cocktails! I recently had a peach manhattan? Maybe old fashioned I can't remember... But it was tits! I'm not even an avid bourbon drinker but I was feeling risky that night and I'm glad I did! The bartenders are awesome and know how to perfectly interact with their guests. Such a perfect addition to Shiloh!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mt. Wash bars. Bottled beer selection is pretty affordable. Their drafts are usually pricier but worth the money, as they are top-notch.  Guess that song trivoa on Wed is a blast."}
{"text":"Cool spot near the incline just a block off of Grandview ave.  Very cool cocktails with a old fashioned vibe.  We had a old fashioned and a Moscow mule. Both were fantastic.   The wait staff was a friendly. It takes a little longer to get your drink but it's because they hand make and take great pride in what they serve up."}
{"text":"I've been here a time or two for drinks and liked it. My husband and I have been here two times to share food and try some cocktails, we were extremely pleased both times! Awesome drinks we had include: Donny Darko & the cucumber press, we had more that I can't remember, I'll update when I do, they were all amazing. Awesome food: GET THE DUMPLINGS! The wings, amaaaaazing smoked Gouda Mac n cheese, & black bean hummus. We had more, but I can't remember! Bottom line, every time we've been there everything we ate and drank was GREAT and the service was always good. They have games there you can play too! Me and the hubby got comfy at a table the one time and played trivial pursuit and ate and drank and had a great time! We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Every time I have friends come to visit in Pittsburgh we come here. We normally get every small plate they have on the menu. While everything taste great, the dumplings are my favorite.  A very relaxing atmosphere and the drink selection is great."}
{"text":"If not for the great cocktails, this place would be a bummer. I was not too impressed during a recent Saturday evening visit here for some dinner and drinks. The place is extremely casual and the music is way too loud but most of the patrons were under 25 so I guess it fits the clientele.  The drinks were very good and I would definitely recommend the old fashioned as it was made with great ingredients. The bartenders knew what they were doing on the cocktail side but that is about all this place did well. We ordered dinner as well and the tacos ($12) didn't have much flavor, the lamb curry ($14) was lacking lamb but still costs the same price as if it did have lamb(?), and the burger ($14) was probably the best thing that we tried. In addition to the average food, there was a weird exchange from the bartenders when they poured my dad the wrong beer. When he asked if it was the one he ordered, they poured him a sample of the one he said he wanted and told him to tell them if they were different. After he told them they were, they got upset before asking again which one he wanted. They eventually got him the one he wanted but the two in question were not the same.  Overall, this place was average. It is definitely a kid hangout that doesn't need to worry about having good food as most people were only there for the drinks. Call me an old man but even with the windows and doors open, this place was extremely too loud. I'm glad I came here but I can't say I would recommend it."}
{"text":"If you enjoy a good Moscow Mule, this place should be put on your \"Must-Try\" List.  I'm a girl that enjoys a good Moscow Mule, and this was one of the best I've ever had. The house-made ginger beer was exceptional, but the house-made ginger CANDY it's garnished with really made it. I also tried the goat cheese fritters (to die for!) and even had them make me a drink that wasn't on the menu... I wanted to utilize the espresso maker behind the bar! Great drinks, food, and service, but it's kind of small, so get there right before happy hour starts!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm well overdue to update my review for this place, especially based on how frequently I am checking in on Yelp.  This is, hands down, my favorite bar in the city of Pittsburgh.  Over time, it's become my \"Cheers,\" where everybody knows my name... hopefully for nothing but good reasons.  The bartenders here are quite possibly the most knowledgeable in the city, and their rotating cocktail menu is a testament to that.  Sure you can get a boring old Tito's and soda (guilty), but you can also have your tastebuds rocked off by a cocktail that you can't quite get anywhere else.  The food is still excellent and this menu also changes seasonally.  Most of the favorites I mentioned in my previous review are no longer on the menu, but they've been replaced by things that are even better.  The dishes they churn out are always consistent and I can't really think of a menu item that I haven't liked. The mac and cheese is always a solid selection, as are the deviled eggs carbonara.  Tacos, bone marrow, dumplings, the Cuban sandwich... there's really something for everyone in terms of food and libations.    Whether I'm in the mood for casual cocktails and conversation or the perfect place to start (or end) my evening, the Summit fits the bill time and time again, and I imagine I'll be back with another 5 star review in due time."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner wanting to do something more casual and it was really just ok.  We loved the decor inside but there was a limited amount of tables so we ended up sitting at the bar.  The bartender was not overly friendly and I felt like could have done more for us.  Really just ok"}
{"text":"Unbelievable drink selection, the bartenders are very attentive/helpful. The food menu is limited but most food choices are really good. They do change up the menu however the pulled chicken sandwiches and pork tacos were tasty."}
{"text":"It's a good place to come after work!! But it's very noisy it's hard to hear what people are saying when having a conversation. There really isn't much of a selection on the menu food wise. I was a little disappointed that boneless chicken wings were not on menu. Every bar has them????? The song trivia was really cool on Wednesday nights."}
{"text":"I live on Mt Washington and love going to the Summit for a drink. They have a long list of cocktails that are creative and use good quality ingredients. Some change seasonally and others stay on the menu year round. I think my favorite is the Spicy Paloma (tequila, fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, and jalapeño). My husband is a total sucker for the Old Fashioned here. They also have a nice selection of wine.  I think my favorite aspect of this place is the atmosphere. When the weather is nice, they open the windows that surround the space and it's totally open air. They also have a big stack of board games that you can play while you're there if you're so inclined.   IMO, the only downside is the prices. The cocktails and food are expensive, especially compared to other places in Mt Wash. I recommend going during happy hour from 5-7pm on weekdays - the house cocktails are $6 and beer is $1 off."}
{"text":"Stopped into grab a quick bite to eat and drink after the Pirates game but ended up staying for hours.  THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!!!  We had the goat cheese fritters (2 orders because they were so damn good), the cheese plate, the duck filled dumpling, tacos and the BBQ ribs. O.M.G. All awesome.  For a beverage, I highly suggest the Moscow mule. Tito's on tap. What whaaaaaattt!  You will not regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Feel so lucky this place is so close to our house in Mt Wash. Very different than anywhere else on Shiloh street or elsewhere on the mount. Always a great atmosphere here. Totally chill. Awesome cocktails. Great beer choices. Very underrated food. Always interesting choices. Always fresh and delicious. Currently decorated for Christmas and it's amazing."}
{"text":"I love the vibe at Summit, the cocktails are really cool. It's just super small and there aren't many seats so I that keeps me away sometimes."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic! The woodwork, the ambience, the food, service and the boardgames!! Oh and the drinks are spot on and in with the times... Also sliding garage when it's warmer. And the music is dope. Highly approve!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  It's awesome when you can find a seat and it's awkward when you can't.   Really great in the summer when they open the garage doors up.  They make awesome drinks and the bar tenders are really great and friendly.   They recently started serving food and from what I have heard it is pretty good but it is a limited menu.  Check out my IG @lookwhatIcaneatrightnow"}
{"text":"The Summit presents a dilemma for East-Enders such as ourselves. The location is sub-optimal. On the occasions that we might venture to the mount we're probably looking for food and drink and since you'll only find the latter here, it probably won't be out destination. Perhaps a 2nd stop, but that's a dicey proposition if you've got to head back down afterwards.   The occasion that brought us here was a friend returning to town and holding a happy hour to see everyone at once. On all such future occasions, this is a great place to hold them. The place is spacious, the drinks are well crafted, and the ambiance is warm and trendy.   Also, USB and power plugs under the bar!?! Yep. Very cool addition that I wish more bars would have."}
{"text":"I think this is a nice addition to Mt. Washington. I live right down the street, and this place is always packed.  For me, the best part of The Summit is the atmosphere. I love how they open all the windows, and it's always just a cool place to be. However, I do think their drinks and food are a bit overpriced. Everything I've tried is good, but because of the prices, I'm more likely to choose somewhere else on Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"Not one to frequent Mount Washington, I found myself looking for a late night hangout on a Thursday night.  Having heard of the Summit, the Yelp reviews encouraged me to try here.  I started my night off with a cocktail that contained Cucumber Vodka ($8). It was one of my favorite cocktails ever, and it was simple. I think it was just Cucumber vodka and soda water, but it was light and refreshing. Loved it.  We also ordered two appetizers, the PSV Rolls ($7) and the Goat Cheese Fritters ($7). I preferred the Goat Cheese Fritters, which are the same concept as Mozzarella sticks, but they are round balls full of creamy goat cheese. Yum!  The PSV rolls were fried pork and beef spring rolls with a spicy chili sauce. They were only OK, though the portion was larger than I suspected.   All in all, if you are on Mount Washington looking for a delicious cocktail bar and some snack food, this is a great place!"}
{"text":"I love this bar!  Granted it is a short walk from my house, but I still love the cocktails!  If you go in during non peak hours, the bartenders are so happy to chat with you.  I asked all about the bar and mixology.  So friendly.   I love the handmade cocktails.  Lots of fresh juices!  Great creative refreshing concoctions.   It's not huge, so on Friday or Saturday it can get crowded, but get there a little early and you can find a table."}
{"text":"The menu drinks are delicious and the happy hour specials make this the kind of place you can make a pitstop to every night after work. With a selection of games there's no need for tv, but you might need to plug in at the bar to ensure you have enough battery to take selfies with your drinks to send to mom! There is a perfect mix of Mount Washington regulars and Mon Incline tourists that makes for a conversation that'll really remind you of how exquisite this city is!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Cute little bar on Mount Washington. Great food, amazing Moscow Mule - must try!"}
{"text":"My favorite cocktail bar in the city backed by outstanding bartenders.  Their drink menu is deep with highly custom drinks along with expertly prepared classics such as the Manhattan. Visiting on a warm spring, fall or summer evening is perfect when they have the windows up and you can catch a view of the city.  Service is good and prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you are looking for something different in a bar.  I love the games you can play and the atmosphere is great, especially in the summer.  However, the prices are crazy for the drinks they serve.  I was not impressed with any of mine and spent way more than expected.  The menu could also use some changes.  I get that they are doing \"different\" type food, but put at least one normal bar type food on there."}
{"text":"Best bartenders in Pittsburgh, in my opinion. The bar doesn't have a TV, which allows for actual conversation. The music is always good. The vibe is definitely lively without being clubby. Mt. Washington is lucky to have it!"}
{"text":"I believe that the Summit is possibly the most underrated cocktail bar in Pittsburgh. Everything I've ever had there was top notch. Easily my favorite place to bring my out of town friends that want to have a drink and see some sights. And obviously only being a block from Grandview Ave, there are amazing sights to behold. Throw in a Duquesne incline ride, and it makes for an unforgettable night."}
{"text":"I visited the Summit yesterday with my cousin from out of town at around 4pm.  While walking along Grandview Ave. en route to the Mon Incline after ascending the Duquesne Incline, a thunderstorm was brewing, so we decided to play it safe and take cover.  At our arrival, it was totally devoid of customers, but that changed when the downpour struck after 10 min., causing many people to seek a respite from the rain here.  After perusing the menu, we both decided to order blueberry mojitos ($10), as well as goat cheese fritters to accompany them ($7).  It had been years since I'd last had a classic mojito, so I was curious to try the blueberry-infused variation.  The presentation was gorgeous (see photo), and the flavor was refreshing and well-balanced.  While the drink wasn't super alcoholic, it still packed a nice head tingling punch that added to the enjoyment.  The goat cheese fritters came out a bit after the drinks.  Upon biting into one, I was surprised by a cold center, despite the perfectly crispy exterior.  I mentioned this to our waitress, and she took them away and put in a replacement order, which came out about 10 min. later.  Fortunately, the second order was cooked through. I'm a huge fan of goat cheese, and these fritters were light and subtler in flavor than I'm accustomed to, but were delicious on their own. While I'm not a big fan of jalapeno, I tried the candied jalapeno dipping sauce that accompanied them, and it wasn't too strongly flavored. I preferred the fritters on their own, though, so I ate most of them undressed.  One of the more unique aspects of this bar, aside from some of the creative drinks, is that board games are available for entertainment while drinking.  I've seen this in coffeeshops, but never in a bar before, and I think it's an absolutely brilliant idea!  While sipping our cocktails, my cousin and I played a spirited game of Jenga, which I eventually won, to my utter surprise (score!).  As expected, several blocks from the tower toppled onto the table next to us--fortunately, however, none of them hit our neighbors' drinks, and they were good sports.  Overall, my cousin and I greatly enjoyed our impromptu experience at the Summit.  The decor makes for an interesting setting, consisting mostly of distressed wood, as well as garage doors that can be opened (or closed, in the case of a storm!). If you're looking for an alternative to some of the more touristy joints on Shiloh, or are just in the mood for a hand crafted cocktail, be sure to stop by and check it out!"}
{"text":"This is BY FAR my favorite place on the mount. Their drinks are tasty and the bartenders are friendly. If you don't see what you want on the menu, they will make you whatever you want. Be sure to stop in for happy hour! They have great food and drink specials."}
{"text":"Great bar for a few hours of work as a solo business traveller. Everyone really friendly and not pushy at all.   Food was good, but 'small' plates are enormous."}
{"text":"The doorman is the most uncooperative person at this bar. I had a valid id and he refused me entry for no reason just because he did not have his facts right. People like this are totally responsible for spoiling the reputation of good places like this."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! Went last night for a couple of drinks hoping for a cool vibe and good cocktails.  That is exactly what I found.  I had a Moscow mule which was a little too citrusy for me-- but still good--I prefer a stronger ginger flavor-- and then a super delicious cucumber vodka drink off of the specialty menu. The smell of spiced cider infused this place. I think it is a great place with a good crowd. By good crowd I mean not too young or old and definitely not a hook up spot.  In the background old hip hop was playing... Tribe called quest... The fall decor was a nice touch too. I recommend as a place to catch up with friends or to go on a date. They even had board games in the corner!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night, where there was only one server on duty. But she was attentive. The place has a great ambiance. We really liked our food. I had the best whiskey sour I've had in a long time. We'll be back!  PS There are games available for the customers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch unexpectedly after a BYS yoga sesh. Small place but big on flavor and fun. My husband and myself shared the Breakfast Tacos and the Croque Madame breakfast sandwich. Honestly, both were so amazing I wish I didn't have to share (lol). The tomatillo salsa that came with the tacos is so delicious I think I'd put it on anything. I also enjoyed a Cap'n Crunch Punch, because why not? Definitely looking forward to making a second trip to try their happy hour!"}
{"text":"The Summit is totally bomb. I can't believe it took me this long to find out about it.   The happy hour is simply too good to be true. Less than $6 for high end craft cocktails?! Manhattans are to die for, almost as good as mine at home. Just kidding, way better because I didn't have to make it. Luxardo cherries and all!  The rest of the cocktail menu was fantastic as well. Combine this joint with a meal at Altius and you will have a night to remember in/on Mt. Washington.   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We went here 2 years ago and spent hours here. We loved the open garage doors and small intimate, dim lit setting. There are board games on shelves you can play. 2 years ago we each tried 4-5 drinks (lushes, I know) and they were all amazing. We came back, so excited, to have more delicious drinks. I was pleased to see their cocktails were the same- and they also had new seasonal ones. We love to try new things, so we ordered off the seasonal list. Regretfully, none of those cocktails were as great as their staple ones. So I recommend just sticking to their staple drinks!! We got the cheese board and we were not impressed. It came with white bread toast-  undercooked yet burn lines ...? 3 smelly cheeses and nuts and 3 jellies. The jellies were the best thing about the cheese board but they weren't anything out of this world. Don't get the cheese board, and just stick to the staple cocktails!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for a nice drink - with both local friends but especially out of towerners. The Summit features a diverse and rotating draft list, and extensive catalog of bottles and superb cocktails. Prices are standard and they have plenty of table games, which makes the atmosphere lively. They recently added a food menu, with offerings a little more up scale then I was expecting. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun. Good music and the option to play games- which is always a good time. I love the layout and am excited to come back when the weather gets nice (they has glass garage doors). They serve you a glass of water as soon as you sit down. I ordered a seasonal drink but got to try two of the mixed drinks and both were delicious. Another fun fact: phone charger cords are setup under the bar for patrons to charge their phones at any times."}
{"text":"I love this place! Always good service. Always good food. Always good drinks and beer selection. They never disappoint. I also love that they have games available and no TVs. Kinda forces interaction with whom you are with. Much needed!"}
{"text":"Just had brunch there while in town and could not have asked for a better place! Good service, the menu was simple and straightforward and the food was delicious. I super recommend the peanut butter and banana waffle, which was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, great service, great atmosphere, great food! Just AMAZING. They have great specials and events, fresh local food, and amazing drinks. Definitely a must when you are near the Mt. Washington area!"}
{"text":"I recently went to the summit before a yelp event. I live in Mt. Washington but haven't really come across any places that I really enjoyed getting cocktails at. The summit always seemed appealing to me but also, tended to be a little too busy each time I walked by (not a bad thing, I know). I chose to meet a friend before heading to the Grandview bakery and I am extremely sad that I have not gone before.  I did not have any of the food but it all looked good. One stand out i remember was their spring pea ravioli, which sounded fresh and delicious. I did have two cocktails. The bartenders seemed incredibly knowledgeable and really friendly. I ordered a drink that I believe was called \"Donnie Darko\" like the movie. This drink is pretty much my existence in a glass. There was rye and a hazelnut maple syrup. Simple and amazing. I also had another drink that I do not remember the name of. I only remember jalapeno and gin were in it. Also, it was gooood. The heat was at the beginning and not on the finish, which I usually find with pepper-based cocktails. It was smooth and not overly sweet. I would have more to rave about if the other drink was not even better.   I will definitely be going back to the summit and the next time I will have food for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for happy hour and meeting friends!  The cocktails are always a good choice (I especially liked the Penicillin drink!)  As for food, I've tried the Roasted Garlic/Herb popcorn which is a great snack when you just want something to munch on while you drink. The Black Bean Hummus, Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese, and Salads are all good too.... every time I go the Menu Specials are different and unique.  I always take guests to this restaurant when they visit Pittsburgh; we ride the Incline up and enjoy the views of the city from Shiloh Street.  Also, there are board games that you can pick and choose from to play while you drink and eat!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a buddy after work on a Sunday. You can find street parking nearby or a pay lot just down the road. They don't open until 5 and we got there right as they opened. It's on the smaller side and filled up fairly quick. It seems to be a real hotspot on Mount Washington. There is a reason for that.  I was told that I needed to try a cocktail despite being a craft beer guy. Speaking of, they had a great selection of crafts. But I digress, I was told to order a cocktail before anything else. I went with a go to, an Old Fashioned.  The gentleman behind the bar went to work and it was almost hypnotic watching him make the drink. It was like watching an artist working with his medium of choice. It took him a few minutes to assemble and put some finishing touches on it but was totally worth the wait. After tasting the drink I can honestly say I don't think I've ever had a true Old Fashioned until that very moment!  It was amazing and eye opening! The attention to detail in making the drink really came through. And that is what is great about the Summit! They truly put effort into the establishment. I for one will be making this a regular stop and strongly encourage others to stop by."}
{"text":"Just moving to Pittsburgh and knowing no one is rough. I live in Mt. Washington and have been really trying to explore. I stopped into The Summit last night after work. What a cool place. The tunes they play are good, not too loud and the atmosphere was welcoming. I sat at the bar and their drinks look beautiful. I simply enjoyed a few glasses of wine. Bartenders are friendly and not pretentious and the crowd is an eclectic mix of folks. The people next to me got the soup of the day and it looked and smelled divine.   Little tip they do mulled wine, I found it too late, but once we get a little snow I can't wait to return and sip on some."}
{"text":"I've come to this place two times for music trivia on Wednesdays. It's a fun environment, with a draft special. It is $2 off all drafts during trivia. I had the mule, which was ok, but expensive. Would like to try the food sometime because it looks good. The bartenders are attentive and know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Great little bar, with a nice selection of draft, craft beers and even more bottle beers including my favorite Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA.   The music is very good, Etta James and Van Morrison along with more contemporary artists.   Ordered the olives and charcuterie.  Nice presentation for the simple order and it came out quickly. The food was perfect for a slow afternoon of gazing at the peek-a-boo view of downtown Pittsburgh.      The server was helpful, knowledgable and gave us plenty of room to just enjoy the ambiance.   The music was a tad loud to carry on a deep conversation, but to just sit and reflect, it was a great spot."}
{"text":"I had the Blood which is basically a blood orange vodka like drink. However I'm not sure if it wasn't made right or what because the after taste was extremely horrid to say the least. It has a very hipster vibe to it also. I'll def try it again."}
{"text":"Really fun place to come have drinks with friends. It is on the smaller side, so come early or be prepared. They have games you can play while you hangout which is why we come back. We played trivia, Jenga and cards against humanity.   The drinks are delicious. Get the mojito!  The negatives are that this place is pricey. My husband and I had a few drinks and an appetizer and our bill was $100!!!! Insane. Also I was not impressed with the food options. I prefer more \"normal\" bar food and everything was a little too off the wall for me. I couldn't find anything to try. If you are into that and enjoy different dishes- then you will enjoy the food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in the city! Their seasonal drinks are to die for and often you won't find anything like them being made anywhere else in the city. Currently they have a sweet potato bourbon cocktail happening topped with an actual toasted marshmallow. There's also the warm apple cider which I would like to drink every day this winter.  I could go on and on about the drinks but their food is a win too with an also seasonally changing menu. All of their ravioli dishes have been excellent and I've had three different versions of them, right now it is one with mushroom which typically I'm not the biggest fan of but they know how to make me love them.  Also, the atmosphere is great, warm, inviting and with board games. You really can't go wrong. I would absolutely recommend everyone check out this spot."}
{"text":"This cozy little bar nestled atop Mt. Washington is the perfect place for a romantic date or to meet some friends for a drink. It's candlelit ambiance sets the scene for any intimate gathering. The bartenders are knowledgeable and will make some fancy and unique cocktails, and they have a great selection of craft beer. Rich, one of the bartenders, recommended a great beer I'd never heard of based on my prior selections and I was not disappointed. My friend and I shared the pork confit al pastor tacos and the warm spinach and feta dip. They were both really flavorful and delicious. Warning: get there early on a Friday night as you may not be able to get a seat. It is very small. I would definitely recommend this place if you want upscale bar food (if that's such a thing) and a casual yet intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome cocktails, I'm an old fashion kinda guy and they are one of the best I have had in pittsburgh. Have not eaten there yet but I will soon. TK"}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my go to spots.  The cocktail and beer menu is extensive. Their old fashions are the perfect balance of sweet and bourbon, neither overpowering the other. I highly recommend coming for their happy hour. Cocktails are $6 and you can get a pound of mussels for $8. Can't beat that.   And, to top it all off, they have a bunch of board games that you bring to your table."}
{"text":"Cool, chic village NYC vibe and crowd.  It's a nice more laid back lounge vibe option from the other restaurants and bars on Mount Washington. They also have a stunning painting behind the bar which deserves your attention.  Message me with your thoughts on it!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot for cocktails, especially during happy hour! The bartenders are phenomenal and very friendly.   I'm a sucker for a good Moscow mule, and the Summit's did not disappoint. They are on tap, but don't let that stray you away; they are truly top notch. They have a pretty decent draft list, and any cocktail I've tried has been great.   As far as food goes, they have some interesting options. I've never actually had a full meal here, but their small plates have always been pretty great. Their spinach and feta dip is not to be missed, and the popcorn is a quick and fun bar snack (especially the roasted garlic and herb popcorn)."}
{"text":"Killer craft cocktails and now full menu and brunch menu. Stop in Sunday for some awesome breakfast tacos"}
{"text":"Living around the corner, I've been to The Summit about half a million times now and I didn't realize that my previous review didn't do it justice. I love this place. They have board games and no TVs. Which just promotes enjoying your company. Their food is so damn delicious. The portions are pretty accurate to how they segment them, small medium and big bites; Delicious on all levels. The menu changes as does the cocktail menu and it seems that everything they produce is delicious.   I had the Green Curry Chicken skewer last time I went. The dish was so aesthetically pleasing and that pleasure was only compounded by how delicious it was. Charred enough to give it a grilled taste with a well-made curry that was accompanied by rice formed into neato slivers that you wouldn't recognize as rice and pickled pineapple on the side. There is a culinary genius at work here who is creative and knows about taste profiles because everything on the dish tasted great and complimented its compadres.   Compliments to the Chef."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in the mount and one of my favorite bars in all of Pittsburgh. The featured cocktails are all delicious. Seriously, you can't go wrong. Especially if you show your face during happy hour where all featured drinks are a measly $6 (Just an FYI: I'm planning on naming my first born Leora, because that drink is my world).  Hoity toity snooty pants mixologists slinging bespoke drinks with a side of pretension make me want to cry in my tumbler. But you don't have to worry about that here. You'll get a darn good bespoke drink if you ask for it, but the bartenders are lovely and down to Earth. These are craft cocktails done right.   Food is great as well. Some of my faves include the Elote Dip, Goat Cheese Fritters, and everything on the brunch menu. Menu items change seasonally so there's always something new to try.   This bar has been such a great addition to the neighborhood. Whether you want to unwind with coworkers over some board games and drinks, or you're trying to impress a date or out-of-towner with dinner, The Summit has you covered."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! The French fries and Mac and cheese were to die for. I also enjoyed the spinach dip and pork tacos. Good service and good company made for a great dinner  love the summit and they have berkey water....perfection"}
{"text":"I live right down the street and would like to say that this is one of the best kept secrets in the burgh! Not only are the drinks delicious but the food is awesome for quick bites while you're hanging with friends playing games. Would recommend to anyone 21+!"}
{"text":"The bar tenders here take care of you so well, there's so much craft created in each drink. The atmosphere here is so living, whether be the numerous artwork scattered throughout the building, or the weekday special and daily board games, this bar is something above the rest. If you're looking for a bar with excellent drinks, lively vibe, and a cut above the rest, The Summit on Mt. Washington is the place to be"}
{"text":"Awesome craft drinks, and these bartenders know their stuff!  The happy hour prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The Summit is a great bar with nice atmosphere (the garage-style rollup windows are awesome for summertime) and delicious cocktails. The food is also quite good. Portion sizes are enormous. Bartenders are solid. It's quiet on a weekday evening although there were few chairs available regardless. I imagine the weekend experience is a different story. That said, no complaints. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh - what a charmer ! Cool funky atmosphere , amazing craft cocktails - had the seasonal Boots with the Fur , and an order of smoked Gouda Mac and cheese . Seriously a perfect combo on the top of Mt Washington!"}
{"text":"Best place in Mt Washington. Excellent cocktails and food...but THAT BEER LIST THOUGH! So darn good."}
{"text":"There I was, enjoying a night filled with libations, good conversation, and merriment when it all came grinding to a halt thanks to a \"wolf in waitress' clothing.\" Being a poor student, yet feeling magnanimous, I decided to pay for my table's drinks. I sacrificed a small animal, and lo and behold a demon appeared. With fiery red hair, and a scowl to match, she told me she'd be happy to fetch the bill. She said her name was Melissa--I assume this was her \"human\" name, since revealing her true form would surely destroy the entire establishment. I paid the bill with my debit card and fearing that my funds were running low, I left a 10 percent tip on the bill (just drinks mind you). Before I could leave the rest of the tip in cash, the check was snatched by her talons, and in a blaze she was gone. Moments later, I felt the icy touch of death on my back, with the words \"was there something wrong with the service?\" spoken through forked tongue, sending a chill up my spine. Apologetically, I began to explain that everything was fine, and hurriedly fumbled through my wallet for a greater offering to the beast. Ashamed, I left the required (apparently) cash on the table, taking the tip to about 18 percent. Wanting to make a quick getaway lest I receive another dirty look, I gathered my party (about 4 people, each of whom tipped tipped to compensate my portion) and we began to exit. On my way out the door, Melissa felt the need to announce to the entire building that \"that guy only left a 10 percent tip!\" Defeated, degraded, and emasculated I left her lair and called the manager the next day. He told me that \"this is really an issue for the owner\" and never called me back.  Overall, summit gets 5 stars for location, board games, and food.  My waitress, however, gets 1 star and can go eat a fart."}
{"text":"I went for music trivia night, which was so much fun! The atmosphere was very laid back and the place truly felt like it was just an old fashioned neighborhood hang out.   I had an Arsenal cider and the browned butter popcorn to munch on. It was very tasty and a nice, cheap option with my drink.   The place wasn't too crowded but there were still about 6 or 7 teams for the trivia. My big group was able to get a table which was great!   I hope to go back for another fun night!"}
{"text":"Randomly meandered to this place out of necessity after exiting the Duquesne incline and holy heck was I happy about it. Lamb shepherds pie, pork dumplings, warm cider bourbon drink, and Elysian pumpkin beer. This place had it all. And when I say all I'm including Jenga and Connect Four board games. This spot is for real."}
{"text":"This is the new Bar that's in the space Havana once stood. After a ten minute wait for a drink, I was ready to walk out, but to give an honest review I stayed and was finally waited on. I ordered a lemon martini, 8 bucks, the bsrtender didn't chill the martini glass properly so after shaking it warmed up rather quickly. It tasted sweeter than i liked but it wasn't bad. No kitchen, so no food. Let's see how long this place lasts. I was there a few days after opening night, it was very crowded and extremely loud. Not my type of bar."}
{"text":"Medium to high end bar that makes very solid cocktails. I'm sure they would make you a gin and tonic if you asked but they specialize in upper shelf liquors mixed with house made ingredients in unique and in house cocktails.   They make a very solid Manhattan, pour a nice selection of craft beers and have a chill atmosphere.   Expect ~$10 cocktails ($6 during happy hour) and draft beers ranging from $5-15. Similar to Acacia on Carson with slightly inferior cocktails and less knowledgable bartenders.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to stop in here for drinks one evening last week, and I am so glad we did! The menu features a selection of specialty cocktails (with a few classics included). It's not every day that you find happy hour pricing on craft cocktails, so we were happy to find that The Summit is an exception; I think we paid about $6 per drink which is really a steal considering the quality.  It's a small space but the large windows/garage doors give it a breezy and open feeling; we had the benefit of being here on a beautiful day. The bartenders were both friendly, welcoming, and made great suggestions. We were here around 6 on a Thursday, and I'm honestly very surprised that it was not busier.   I had an excellent spicy Paloma which combined grapefruit, tequila, and jalapeno. It was fantastic! They did not hold back on the heat which I appreciate; as a lover of hot foods, if you're going to describe an item as spicy, then it better live up to the description!  We only came for drinks, but the food menu was tempting and will be the reason for my return visit. I don't make it to Mt. Washington often, however this gives me yet another reason to hop on the incline and pay a visit."}
{"text":"Cool place with cocktails just like I like. I took the one with \"Outdoors\" in it - a herbal whisky something that came served with a big sprig of rosemary - yum! And the Bone Marrow dish was amazing. I've never seen that on a menu before, so I was like a moth to a flame with that one. Go here :)"}
{"text":"Drinks and food were great! I loved the mac and cheese, absolutely delicious. We went on Bingo night (Tuesdays) which was a ton of fun!"}
{"text":"It's high time I update my review because I'm happy to report this place has grown leaps and bounds from when it first opened. I honestly think it is one of the best and inventive cocktail bars in Pittsburgh. Their cocktail menu is super seasonal, and offers up some really great choices. I've always had incredibly made old fashion's. The classics are so great here, I don't stray too often.   But what surprised me the most was the improvement of the food! When they first opened, I believe they did not offer food? Then they started promoting their kitchen and got a new chef I was excited about. I tried a couple dishes that were pretty unremarkable. So I hadn't been back in a while for food. I didn't even realize they totally revamped their menu.   Listen, I am STILL thinking about those delicious crispy fries. There HAD to be some sort of secret ingredient. I feel like I tasted some vinegar maybe? They were so good! Then I had some brussels sprouts, which were equally crispy and delicious. I can now confidently say I will absolutely be back to eat my way through the menu, with cocktail in hand of course!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best bar in Pittsburgh. Fantastic cocktails, shockingly delicious food, a great happy hour, trivia night, and currently the finest Halloween decor I've seen anywhere.   Their staff does leave a little something to be desired though. Sure, all the bartenders are funny, cool, and truly talented when it comes to cocktails...but one of them tried to drown me when I was four years old, and I'm still holding a grudge.  Full Disclosure: My brother works here.   Don't worry though. I would never let it influence my review...at least not positively. That asshole never let me tag along with his friends, and didn't even have the common decency to look enough like me that I could use his ID when I was underage.   Family differences aside, The Summit is awesome.   The cocktail menu changes somewhat seasonally, but they will always be able to provide quality classics, slight twists on the classics (Old 87!), and completely off-the-wall, you-can't-get-this-anywhere-else-and-I'm-surprised-it-works options. There's a drink right now that is made with house-infused porcini mushroom cognac. And I liked it.   The food menu also rotates dishes in and out, but if the brussels sprouts are there, do yourself a favor and get them. They are vegetables, and they are goddamn delicious (the cubes of halloumi help). The burger is outstanding, the fries are perfect, and even the salads are worth ordering. This is far better than average bar food. My only regret is that I spent two days in Pittsburgh inhaling all the meat, and didn't have room for the mac and cheese. Next time."}
{"text":"Such a cool bar, I was not really happy with the quality of the drinks and the appetizers (the dumplings) were terrible. I was so hopeful that this would become my new watering hole. As I said the space alone is amazing. Just because of the ambiance i'm willing to give it another shot. I wish I could have said better things since this seems to be such a slam dunk for everyone else. Planing on attending the music trivia nights sometime soon. Hopeful that will leave me whistling a different tune."}
{"text":"GREAT COCKTAILS! Seriously, amazing. If I had to choose, The Sex Tape was my favorite, and not just cause of the name lol. Unfortunately, I can not say anything about the food. I was interested in trying some dishes, but the server/bartender never checked back on us after the first drinks. I wanted another delicious cocktail, so I just ordered at the bar. May it's like that? No servers? The restaurant was really well designed. Super urban. The basement had graffiti along the walls. And again, great cocktails."}
{"text":"They don't get five stars because the music is so ridiculously loud that you can't hear anyone talking to you across a table.  You have to scream for anyone to hear you.  And considering this is not a club, they could stand to turn it down.    The place is small, but nicely appointed.  Could definitely use more space.  It was packed on a Wednesday night.  The bartender was very attentive and knowledgeable, and she definitely gave the experience a finesse that is lacking more often than not in 2017.  Cocktails were very interesting, and not at all expensive.  I was expecting an $80 check at the end of the night, and was thrilled when it came back at $51.  That was for four cocktails, a glass of prosecco, and an appetizer.  (Was there for a friend's birthday, and picked up two of her drinks, so really, had it been a regular day, I could go there, and have two drinks and food for $35ish...)  I would recommend purely for the inexpensive well-prepared cocktails alone, but if service is like that every night, I don't think anyone will ever leave disappointed.    I'd like to see more food options on the menu.  Not every single thing has to be elevated and different.  Wings or just plain old fries would satisfy that.    And I know I'm old, but if you don't have TVs in the bar so you can promote conversation, turn the music down to a level where you can actually hear what other people are saying.  We did spend the night screaming \"WHAT?!\" at each other."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and discovered The Summit on Yelp. We're not big on cocktails (which seem to be what they're best known for) but were tempted by the deviled eggs with pancetta and parmesan (because WTF is better than bacon & cheese?!) They did not disappoint, and neither did the pork dumplings or gouda mac & cheese!  The dumplings were different, the pork was almost like a meatball in flavor and texture... which I actually enjoyed more than a traditional dumpling. To cap it off I had the chicken tacos and my fiancé had the burger. I enjoyed the tacos but was too stuffed to finish them. The burger (though not medium rare as both suggested by our waitress and ordered) was delicious and \"one of the best he'd had in awhile.\" Overall a great experience and our waitress Melissa was super friendly, attentive, and cool. I saw some reviews complaining about the price but we're from D.C. so it didn't seem expensive to us at all. We got all the food above plus two hard ciders for $65. Will definitely return if back in the area and recommend to others."}

Our server Melissa was fantastic though the place was clearly busy.  We even got to compete in a music trivia competition which was super fun and unexpected.  The neighborhood was really charming, walked over from the Incline. Would definitely come back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh! Highly recommend!"}
