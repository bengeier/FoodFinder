{"text":"Sure Lakeshore Coffee House is old school, as are it's baristas, but so is Euclid. Don't expect ac, great lighting, or a fancy sound system. The coffee is good, strong and hot. There is a great selection. The prices are competitive. There are plenty of cup sizes including huge. And the mochas are the best, bar none! They also have coffee ice cubes at no extra charge so as not to water down your summer caffeine. Just ask for them.

LCH serves breakfast and lunch items & ice cream, too.  Patronize this local independent and skip the chains!"}
{"text":"I visit this place often for coffee and sometimes a muffin. This morning I was in getting coffee and looking at the muffins Y were there Roaches crawling over the muffins and it wasn't just one."}
{"text":"Imagine walking into a coffee shop at 5:45pm on a Thursday night (they close at 7PM) and seeing all the wonderful beans on the wall and the smell of gourmet coffee all around and three (sometimes four) thermos pumps each labeled with some unique coffee flavor just calling for you to try.  Your mouth starts to water in anticipation of some incredible never before tried cup of coffee.  You grab your cup and choose your style and push the pump down to see some steaming hot coffee begin to pour into your cup and the sound of  pumping air begins--you've drained the pot after only a few ozs. have been delivered.  You think to yourself that this is enough to taste it and request the fresh pot from the person behind the counter.  You bring the wonderful nectar of the gods up to your lips and taste the beautiful result of expert roasting and decide it is incredible.  The few ozs. tasted fantastic and you excitedly request a fresh pot be brewed as you have the time and the wait will be worth it.  The counter person looks at you and kind of squints her eyes in pondering inquisitiveness and asks you what time it is.  You look at your phone and reply back in a confused muster 5:45pm.  She looks up to her left and replies \"no, because we close at 7pm and we throw a lot of coffee out!.\". You are taken aback and are speechless for a minute and your only reply is \"Is this a coffee shop\".  You settle for the boring house blend which essentially is a little better than the typical gas station on the typical corner and you walk out wondering to yourself--\"Why do I keep coming back here?\"..."}
{"text":"Simple mom and pop coffee joint in downtown Euclid that makes a good unsweetened caramel latte. They also carry chocolate covered coffee and expression beans which is a plus. Price is good and there is parking in the rear."}
{"text":"A nice place to stop by and get a good coffee beverage. It is a good atmosphere and much less pretentious then other chain shoes. They also make good breakfast sandwiches. It's close to home and can be walked to. So enjoy a nice local treat. Check it out if your around."}
{"text":"Terrific small, local place to grab some coffee or food! It looks a bit dark from the outside, but I'm so glad I gave this place a chance. The baristas are friendly and knowledgeable, and coffee is very reasonably priced. Lake Shore Coffee House also provides free wifi, making this the perfect place in the area to sit, relax, and enjoy. :)"}
{"text":"So, this place isn't much on ambience when I went there on a recent Saturday morning around 10 AM, but it got me caffeinated for a low cost which I am a fan of. The guy behind the counter was honest enough to confess that the pastries in the case were leftovers from the day prior, so I just grabbed a granola bar and a coffee and for 2.60, I was good to go. It was a cloudy day, so the lighting inside wasn't the best and it was a bit dim, but if you want a cheap cuppa joe w easy parking, this is your kind of place."}
{"text":"Nice prices. Nice location. Coffee wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. It's really just a nice local place to support rather than getting horrible service at the Dunkin Donuts that's on the next corner."}
{"text":"I dont come for the coffee i come for the ice cream lol. They sell Hershey ice cream at a great price. The place is dated and old and could use some tlc but the regulars wouldn't have it any other way. I've relaxed here in the summer when taking my kids here for ice cream and always get friendly service. Ill keep coming back when in the area and in the mood for ice cream."}
{"text":"This place has been around since I was in high school (probably longer than that) and I am just now trying this place. Wasn't too impressed at all. I decided to get the caramel apple coffee...sounds good but nope...didn't like it at all. The older gentleman wasn't very friendly either.  Even though it was pretty cheap, I think I got a 16 oz for only $2.50, I ended up throwing it away...went to another place that sells coffee that was a bit more pricier.

Second visit...I'll pass"}
