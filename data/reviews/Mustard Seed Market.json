{"text":"Like a whole foods back home- but more personable. Great place to pick up some groceries that were needed for the week and grab a bite at the sit down( something whole foods lacks) easy parking and easy to get to location."}
{"text":"Mustard Seed was a wonderful spot for my daughter's bridal shower.  The food was displayed elegantly and everything was delicious.   Katie did an excellent job coordinating the event from start to finish.  I would highly recommend for any event."}
{"text":"I come here for very specific things.  I love it.  I wish that I could buy everything here, but it is pretty expensive.  I love that they have a broad selection of local offerings.  I love that it is so big and family owned.  The products are high quality. I can buy water here that is free of flouride and chlorine.  Their salad bar and prepared food is excellent and all of the produce is just superlative.  

My favorite thing is the bulk foods.  I buy all of my grains, herbs, spices, popcorn, beans, etc. from Mustard Seed in their bulk food area. I loove it.

The employees are always kind and helpful.  The store is clean and nicely laid out.  Often they have cool baskets, bird feeders, organic potting soil, and vitamix products on display in the front of the store.  

Excellent place, great bulk foods, thankful to have it close by."}
{"text":"We love Mustard seed for their concept and items they carry.  Prepared foods are also delicious.  I gave it only 3 stars because they are expensive and their produce can sometimes be on the overripe side. We shop here at least once a week."}
{"text":"The Mustard Seed Market may be great if you are following a restricted diet, but as an omnivore who tries to eat local, organic or at least interesting food, I've been pretty underwhelmed. Their healthy vegetarian lunches are pretty good, but when I called to ask whether they had buffalo mozzarella -- not that exotic -- the cheese counter person didn't know what it was (she thought I was talking about the shape, not the milk.) And, no, they didn't carry it. I wish MSM were better, since I'd rather shop locally, but Whole Foods is much more likely to have what I need."}
{"text":"I grabbed a turkey wrap and a carrot & beet drink from their juice bar.  Loved the juice, but the wrap was super dry.  For $7 you would expect more flavor & more substance.  
Grocery store was nice, good selection of natural foods,"}
{"text":"Way overpriced , the manager at the Solon store is an idiot no interaction with the customers and can't understand why they keep him. The frozen vegetables are from China...no thanks and many of the products are past their dates....go shop at Earth Fare!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever experience. Tried to buy a bottle of wine and was told because I was talking to the girl behind me I could not because they needed her ID also. We were two separate transactions. She said that she couldn't prove I wasn't buying for her?!? Where am I? Is this a dream? Am I being accused of buying for a minor? (Which she wasn't!)

Backstory, I work very close and go here almost on a daily basis, chat with all the cashiers and usually have a standard experience... Not today.

Their wine section is decent and I like to try what they have on sale for changes but after this incident I will not return for lunch or to pick up essentials for home. Good luck with the horrid cashiers, I would rather pay $18 for a watermelon somewhere else. Thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a vegan, gluten free, sugar free meal. I am from out of town visiting Solon for a wedding and this place was a Godsend. I was able to load up on healthy snacks and get wonderful meals from the salad bar and deli. Cannot recommend enough! 
One little complaint is their juice and smoothie bar wasn't 'green' enough for me. All fruit smoothies with tons of sugar, would have like to have seen a healthier green smoothie option. But other than not having my green smoothie, I was pleasantly surprised with the options and quality for a health foodie like me!"}
{"text":"How does this place stay in business?  The prices are higher than Whole Foods, the selection worse and the management horrible - though the dairy guy is great!  He's always helpful and tries to give customer service.  In a couple interactions we had, he tried to help and management shot him down as they clearly don't care about customers.  Also, the Body/Supplement people push me away from being a customer as they don't seem to like people coming around their area.  Why?"}
{"text":"Bad service, expensive, and the juice and drink bar claims whole fruits but only adds cheap juices"}
{"text":"Their menu caters to those restricted to gluten free diets. 

The food was excellent. This restaurant is a bit more elegant than the Akron location's."}
{"text":"I was vegetarian for a few years and I am now vegan.   Mustard Seed is a great place because they carry a lot of stuff for people with special dietary needs.   Lots of vegan, vegetarian, and GF options available.   The store also has prepared food and baked goods, again available in vegan and GF versions as well.

They have a really nice and well stocked bulk food section and a decent selection of produce.   I must admit, it isn't super cheap like a Walmart or Aldi's, but I go here for specific items I cannot get in other stores.   I do my other shopping at Aldi, Walmart, and Giant Eagle for the \"normal\" stuff.

They have a place where you can sit and eat any prepared food you buy and a juice bar to. 

The place is clean and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"I adore Mustard Seed.  If you are at all following the Forks Over Knives diet or just trying to cook any vegan recipe and are looking for things like Miso or Arrowroot powder, this is the place.  They have EVERYTHING you need, clearly labeled as vegan or gluten-free.  

  I especially enjoy getting all of the shopping done and getting to the ready to go vegan items in the deli and bakery - the battered tofu is superb with a side of veggie sushi rolls and the vegan cookies are fantastic.  I also am craving their vegan \"chicken\" salad and would love to know how they made it!

  Their freezer section is full of handy things like Tofutti and Tofurky and everything you could ever want.  Their staff is friendly and helpful and they also have a large supplement section.

  I enjoy coming here more than Whole Foods and delight in their fresh produce and large selection.  I'm so thankful they are nearby!"}
{"text":"Although Mustard Seed is a great store, I was not impressed with the food. The food seems to always taste odd and the prices were expensive. The only good thing about this place is that it caters to restricted diets but I did not like the food."}
{"text":"Been a while since I ate here. The store has not changed and that's not a bad thing. The prepared foods looked good and I grabbed a cold protein for my salad. 

The salad bar was clean and fresh. There are enough items to make a great lunch salad and I added a piece of salmon from the prepackaged area. 

Both the salad and the salmon were excellent in quality and taste. There are adequate beverage choices and the dine in area was very clean. Great spot to grab a lunch salad and enjoy while there."}
{"text":"Best grocery store in Northeast Ohio!

After recently moving to the Cleveland area from Southern California, I just assumed Whole Foods would be as good as it gets as far as organic, healthy grocery stores in the area.  Which made me sad. Very sad.  Because the Whole Foods here aren't great.  It actually got to the point where I would cry every time I went to Whole Foods (Rocky River and the one on Chagrin) because their selection of organic produce was just SO bad.  (But, this isn't a review of Whole Foods...)  I had given up and resigned myself to the fact that this was just the cost of living in Ohio.  And then I found Mustard Seed.

I found Mustard seed online last Friday at work and could not wait to check out the Solon location for myself.  I got so anxious I ended up leaving work early because I wanted to go so bad.  And it did not disappoint.  I walked in \"just to see,\" and left $80 later - without any sort of grocery list or plan.  I just couldn't help myself with all the amazing produce, bulk food (especially RAW ORGANIC nuts), and all the specialty products that other stores in the area just do not have.  I didn't have time to slowly wander the store as I would have liked to, but can't wait to fully explore and see what this gem has to offer!

All this place needs is an organic juice bar and we will be set!"}
{"text":"We love shopping at Mustard Seed Market. We drive in from the Warren area just to be able to have such a great variety of healthy foods to choose from. We especially like how well the store is labeled and we are able to find just what we need. 

Today we even took a break and stopped to enjoy a bite to eat. We had just run in to grab drinks but the hot foods smelled so good that we stopped to eat lunch. My sister made a salad and we picked three of their hot food selections to sample and share. We chose the French Toast, Mac and Cheese and the Turkey Meatloaf Muffin wrapped in Turkey bacon. 

My sisters salad was awesome! She had so many fresh items to choose from! The selection was wonderful! And as for the hot selections... The French Toast just melted in my mouth. I loved the custard like taste to it and it reminded me of a French Toast bread pudding! As someone who actively searched for new ways to make French Toast this was truly a hit. The turkey meatloaf muffin was seasoned spot on but it was a bit dry. I think had it had some gravy with it we would have liked it even more. We dug into the center and that part was at least a bit more moist and so we just ate around the edge. The Mac and Cheese was very creamy but very bland. I still enjoyed it though! 

We are going to remember to come here and check out he hot selections more for lunch while on errands because this was really fun. We got to try new things and have a lovely meal all at a great price!!!! We are for less than $20 --- and it was healthy!"}
{"text":"It's a great organic grocery store...very large.  The selection is great and the attendants are very helpful.  Look forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Everything you could possibly desire in a health food store: fresh, organic produce, baked goods prepared without artificial ingredients or preservatives, a vast selection of herbs and supplements, and hard to find spices!"}
{"text":"I used to work nearby and would often go to MSM and buy a prepared sandwich or, more often, sushi.  I also liked that MSM has wonderful fresh food selection, and offered some really good ethnic frozen food selections that you couldn't breally get anywhere else.

Well, I have since changed jobs and hadn't been to MSM in over a year but had the chance to stop in yesterday and while MSM still has a great fresh food selection, I was disappointed to find out that they changed several of the brands and selections on frozen food options that appear to me to be of lower quality.  Also, although I'm not 100% sure, but it looks like they may now be getting their sushi prepackaged and the selection or appearance just didn't appeal to me.  I ended up going down a couple store fronts to Akira and ordered some sushi to go.

I like MSM and will always pop in here when I'm in the area but it does make me wonder why the changes."}
{"text":"This place is great. I mainly stop in for lunch from their prepared foods section. Their salad bar is THE BEST. They have a huge variety of lettuces, veggies, fruits, nuts, and prepared salads. They make all their own dressings and every one is delicious. They also have soups, sandwiches, pizza, sushi, baked goods, and a hot bar. I'm not a vegan but their vegan options are better than the real thing. Try the vegan \"chicken\" salad or the vegan double chocolate cookies.
The beer and wine selection is great and the guy who works there knows his stuff and is very helpful if you need a recommendation. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Neat place to get specialty items. Main downside is the prices are quite high, but I think that's just because the items usually sell for those prices, and sometimes the staff aren't very nice (maybe I caught them on an off day?). I like to try a lot of unique things, though, and in that they definitely deliver."}
{"text":"Mustard Seed offers a variety of organic and health food products. While the Solon location is quite large and clean, it is not quite as nice as say Whole Foods. I frequently purchase prepared foods and wine here. Food is usually fresh and high quality. Prices, as some have mentioned, are a little more than what you may pay in a traditional store. It is a good place to find some hard to find items. You can also purchase staples such as pasta, flour, etc from their bulk section which is useful. I have found the staff here to always be very friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Bakery review: We ordered a Knockout cake for a party and it was soooo good. I don't remember last time when I enjoyed the cake so much. It's definitely not your typically overly sweet and plain cakes you'll find anywhere else. If you have European friends, they will love it. They also make excellent pear tarts."}
{"text":"This place sells high quality goods.  I only wish that the Solon location had as much to offer as the Montrose location, mainly in terms of a restaurant.  Apparently they used to have one upstairs almost a decade ago.  They supposedly sometimes think about reopening it but it doesn't seem like anything is happening.  I hope that they will seriously consider at least having the Sunday brunch buffet, as going down to Montrose is a bit of a trek for those of further north!  Please, please, please open up a similar Sunday brunch here soon!  I think the wellness movement spreading from Cleveland and the west side to this area warrants it!"}
{"text":"My review is strictly based on a quick walk-thru of the store, their demonstration kitchen and my small purchase of to-go sushi and a bev.

We need definitely need more local grocery stores around downtown Cleveland like this! I mean, the West Side Market is amaze-balls, but it's not open everyday. This family-owned operation has two locations and this one is super-easy to get to. Well, I mean it's pretty much right off of the freeway--422, that is. I'm just sad because I don't get over in that area much, so I miss out on this market. 

The selection is huge, plentiful and features lots of local vendors--an aspect I thoroughly appreciate. I can't wait to come back and spend more time combing through the store, discovering new local yummies and such. 

My first, short trip into Mustard Seed sent me off with some brown rice sushi and a drink. The sushi was pretty good--standard, fresh. I loved that I could get it with brown rice. 

I didn't notice the different price points around the store since I didn't get to actually shop-shop, but I'm not one who minds paying for local, quality, specialty items. I don't go nuts, but if you like to cook, you enjoy those things."}
{"text":"If you are looking for organic, heathy, vegan, vegetarian, dairy-free, kosher, etc this store will probably have it.
There is a great variety of prepared foods. They make their own butter, hummus, bread, sushi, lentil salads, etc. There is a cafe upstairs also with similar items.
It seems like all the veggies are organic, and you won't necessarily find items that are not in season (for example, they have mangoes but not nectarines). I also didn't notice many items that seemed locally grown, although I could have missed the signs, but I know the Heinen's always has signs to point this out.
Huge variety of cleaning, bath and personal care products that deemed themselves all-natural (like toothbrushes recycled from yogurt cups).
Most impressive (to me) was the dairy and refrigerated section. Yogurt, ice cream, and desserts made from coconut milk! Ice cream made from Hemp Milk! Lots of frozen/refrigerated meals to make it easier to be a vegan/vegetarian.
Of course, it's not cheap. And the kind of products that you'd find in Giant Eagle were significanly more expensive here (like Newman's own spaghetti sauce for $2 more than you'd see it at Wal-Mart). 
But still, a good option. They also have a half priced bread/bakery rack where I got some very delicious bread with no preservatives. Yum!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend was coming in town to visit and is restricted to a Gluten Free diet.  I wanted to prepare a dinner but had no clue what \"Gluten Free\"  actually meant.

The staff at Mustard Seed was very helpful in showing me tasty gluten free options and assisted me in putting together the perfect dinner!  Once again, the service and selection wow'd me."}
{"text":"Yes it has been around for a while. Yes it sells organic and green items. No it is not the cheapest place to shop. I was disappointed in their fresh produce and meat departments which seemed somewhat limited. There is so much fresh produce in nearby farmers markets but not as much here. Fortunately there are other choices out there."}
{"text":"My parents have been going to Mustard Seed since it used to be a little place in the valley. It is so great that such an awesome local business continues to grow. Aside from a great family behind the operation, MSM offers a huge variety of health foods and seasonal produce. I was so surprised at how big the Solon location was (and my friends and I love the juice bar). They also have some of their health-related lectures here. They are a local business that is dedicated to the health of the community. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"1. It's the (biggest?) local organic chain grocer. 

2. They support local businesses and farmers.

3. Sign up to their email and you'll get one free item every week with $5 minimum purchase.

4. They have a basket of fruit free for kids while adults shop.

5. The staff are extremely friendly and knowledgable about clean food, paleo diet.
 
6. Products that couldn't get onto shelf to Whole Foods (often due to business size) can be found here, because mustard seeds are less strict about that. As a result you can find small business grower produce here you couldn't get from WF.

7. They have weekly organic produce on sale that I find cheaper than WF.

8. While I'm waiting for this hail storm to pass, I'm all cozy up on their couch writing this review. Yes, they have comfy rest areas."}
{"text":"High prices, poor selection, and hit or miss quality?  I will review this store again as it was my first time in here, but it pales in memory to my experiences at the location on Rt. 18. Reminds me of a weaker version Fresh Market. I feel that Fresh Market gouges their customers and delivers hit or miss quality as well. I understand the organic local theme, but it requires more effort to get to even 3 stars for this theme. You can't price raise your way into better quality or selection, but you can price your way out of a bad market. We don't shop a place on principle, or do we? This is unsustainable."}
{"text":"I miss when this place had the restaurant upstairs! That's where all the good food was.  The to-go options like the burritos, sushi, and even the deli items aren't really that great and leave something to be desired. Good place for vitamins and non produce related groceries because you might end up spending an arm and leg on a watermelon :).  The juice/smoothie bar makes no sense to me so I avoid it like the plague and opt for making something at home instead. There's never anyone there and I have to run back and forth from the counter to the register and it's a pain. The last time I chose to get a smoothie, I had to wait for someone to show up and decide to take my order only to be given a ticket and told I needed to pay at the register in a tone that suggested I should have known this already.  I waited in line to pay at the register only to go back to get my drink which hadn't even been made yet because I had to hand the girl my receipt.  I don't know if you can order drinks while you're in line paying for your groceries but my experience was a hassle. Please, please, please do something about this.  Accept cash only at the drink bar and issue a ticket for credit cards, accept drink orders at the register, add a register in this area... something that's not what I experienced."}
{"text":"Mustard Seed is legit.

With any kind of health market, there's always a bunch of lingering questions...
What if I can't pronounce anything?
Isn't it more expensive?
What if I don't recognize any brands?

But yes, you can pronounce everything, its not more expensive, and you'll see things you recognize. In fact, I'd even argue that some things are cheaper in the Mustard Seed.

Let me begin my totally random list of observations:
- Mustard Seed has one of the best grab-and-go meal sections I've ever seen. Between the plentiful veg, non-veg, vegan and gluten-free options, it's astounding how copious the selection is. I don't normally grab veg/non-vegan options, but they just looked too yummy. The Szechuan noodles and vegetable rice were ah-mazing.

- Wine and beer selection. Holy moly, this selection is huge, with some pretty beautiful bottles (yes, I'm that person who judges the packaging of wine bottles).

- If you don't eat dairy, the non-dairy aisle is the bees knees. I've never seen so many types of inexpensive non-dairy milks organized in one aisle. But if you eat dairy, the cheese selection will make your mouth water.

- Their beauty section has some of the best local organic soaps, skincare and make-up. I could spend all my money on their selection of Chagrin Valley Soap & Salve.

Overall, don't dismiss Mustard Seed. The shopping soccer moms can be a little intense, but if you can tune them out, I think this huge market will surprise you!"}
{"text":"Mustard Seed is a LIFESAVER! Making organic, vegan, and health foods readily available to this part of the greater Cleveland area, it really shines as a large and unique grocery store. From bulk nooch to a huge selection of vegan ice creams and cold brew coffees, lots of local produce, and wide varieties of wines, cheeses (including treeline vegan), chocolates, soaps/beauty care, supplements/vitamins and free samples, I feel like you could live in this store. 4 stars because the prices of many items have gone up in recent years (supplements/protein and nut butters especially that are much cheaper for the same brands on amazon, GNC, etc), but the baked goods and fresh food remain reasonably priced. 

VEGANS: the vegan carrot cake and the vegan chocolate pudding are THE BOMB!"}
{"text":"They really deserve a 2.5. STEP UP YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. It is 7:05 you are still open another hour at least, act like it. I went to the prepared foods section they looked at me like I was at the wrong place. I asked for a vegetable pizza, she said let me see then said a limited number of vegetables in a health food store. You wonder why this store is more empty every time I go there. Well there is competition with market district I like to support local."}
{"text":"What happened to the Tomato Basil soup??? I go to Mustard Seed for lunch often and my favorite is the Tomato Basil soup (along with a co-worker of mine). I haven't seen it in months. I have only seen the Tomato vegetable soup. Bring back our Tomato Basil!! Pleeeaaase!!"}
{"text":"Earthy, Fun, Expensive, Selective and so so so worth it all...

Sure it's expensive but it's amazing.  Their fresh food counter is amazing, don't pass it up.  Pizza, vegan, tofu, dessert  WOW

I love Creme Brulee and Tofu Jerky and in the salad bar is a marinated tofu that is simply amazing. 

There is vitamins, drinks, wnes, beers, fresh veggies and fruits, baskets, fun things, makeup...  

GO THERE. it's a fresh alternative to whole foods...  and a bit more relaxed shopping environment as well."}
{"text":"Mustard Seed is a great store. I have been coming here for lunch the past few weeks and have never been disappointed. The sushi is actually decent. The prepared meals are plentiful and decently priced. There is a free drinking water cooler in the dining area for the customers. My friend sometimes will sneak in a beer on his lunch break. I ask if people at work ever suspected him of lunch time drinking. They do not. The beer selection is outstanding. It is just as good, if not better than most beverage stores. The food is a little on the pricey side. It still won't stop me from coming here a lot."}
{"text":"Like Trader Joe's, but way bigger and with more goods. Great artisan cheeses, world spanning beers, cheap produce and every veggie product under the sun. I wish one of these was in every town instead of Ginormous Emu. I had no idea there was a Fairlawn location until I looked this up. Lucky you, Fairlawn. You have a halfway decent mall, THE best record Exchange around, a winking lizard and no section 8."}
{"text":"This is such a nice family owned food market.  It has been in the area for many years in Solon, Ohio.  It is located on Kruse Drive.  This store focuses on organic foods, supplements, and vegan options for a healthy lifestyle.  I prefer Mustard seed to Whole foods because it is quieter, better lit, and easier to get through.  The crowds and pretense at Whole Foods is annoying.  
 
The staff at Mustard seed are always very friendly and are always happy to say, \"hello\" or check in if I am finding everything.  The shelves are very organized and open . 
 
The selection of items is something I appreciate.  They have fresh breads, vegan desserts (which no one else has), a full service bakery, a smoothie bar, an upstairs dining area, and fresh floral.   The dining area is a great place for a quiet cup of coffee or a quick snack. 
 
Mustard Seed is a neighborhood gem.  I would encourage locals to \"Shop Local\" and keep this store in business."}
{"text":"Mustard Seed is a bit over-priced, but it's a nice store to wander around in.  I like to pop in here for lunch and pick up a salad or one of their prepared food items.  If you have any special dietary needs this would be a great place to shop!"}
