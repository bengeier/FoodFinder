{"text":"Decided to try this place for dinner last night.  The hostess, an asian  woman, showed the 3 of us to our table.  It was right in front of the Kitchen and we asked her if we could move.  Half the restaurant was empty and another table nearby just had to be cleaned.  She said 'no', as this was all she had.  We told her that we would rather move so she turned around with the menu's in hand and went back to the front to put them away. We followed behind and left.  By the looks of this place they needed us more than we needed them so we headed off to another restaurant with a lot more vibe for a Thursday night.  Atmosphere seemed  cafeteria like with a bar. Rejecting paying customers is a nice way to kill a business.....good luck.  I'd look for a new hostess."}
{"text":"Paid 4$ for a soda water , thanks for punishing the DD . Total scam. When you have a drink with some but you need to drive home I guess just a normal water is better . Shocked to see $4 of the bill . Thanks"}
{"text":"I was at a conference very near here a few days ago and a few people and I decided to go here for lunch. We all had the burgers and we told our server we were pretty pressed for time. Our server was great and got us out on time.

The burger was okay. It would have been better if it wasn't overcooked. There was no moisture to be found in this patty, but the flavour was good. The sweet potato fries and the mayo-horseradish were yummy.

As you can imagine, given that this bistro is in the lobby of a hotel, the prices were higher than they you'd normally like to pay for this quality of food, but the ambiance is nice, the waitstaff is polished and professional, and it is a convenient location."}
{"text":"The worst breakfast I ever had. Everything completely soaked in butter. Stale hash browns. Not fresh orange juice. Tastes like Minute Maid. The Canadian bacon was packaged deli meat. I only came here because it was located in the hotel where I'm staying. I should have walked a few blocks for a better breakfast."}
{"text":"Since a bunch of us were staying at the Sheraton Hotel - we decided to grab late night drinks following dinner @Katsuya. The bar area was very nice with booths. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for my drink- I ordered an old Fashioned that had club soda in it! So I returned the drink for a lychee martini which was better. Our waitress was very accomodating. 

I'm sure the food here is great - given it had Oysterfest signs up."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, I've worked in hospitality for many years and this was by far the worst I have ever encountered. The hostess upon entering the restaurant was rude and very nonchalant, told us it was very busy and walked passed us without asking if we were dining in. Finally the manager came over to seat us at a table, it took about 5 minutes for the the waitress to come and when she came she had a terrible attitude, she stated that it'll be a long wait for the food so my cousin asked about how long would the wait be and would the food be hot? She replied very rudely if you have time to wait I can't give you an expected time, rolled her eyes. I could have walked to a 5 start restaurant in the neighborhood and got better food and service! After going back and forth with the rude waitress we order and the food was horrible! We will never, I repeat never spend our money in this poor excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"BnB Bistro was the oddly sad hotel bar/restaurant at the Toronto Sheraton, where I spent a few nights for a mystery writers' conference last month. As conference bars go, it was neither the worst nor the best, but I was glad to have other options for food and drink within a short walk of the hotel.

Still, I ended up drinking here every night of the conference, as this is where we all congregated. There was a lot to like. Quick, friendly service, a well stocked bar, and plenty of seating. I tried two of the IPAs on tap--the Great Lakes Karma Citra, and I think the other one might've been called the Boneyard IPA--and both were good. I also witnessed the pouring and consumption of an enormous glass of Hoegaarden. When I wasn't up for large volumes of beer, I drank Old Fashioneds and whiskey gingers, perfectly serviceable drinks.

For some reason, though, we kept hanging out in the brightly lit Sheraton lobby instead of the actual bar. (One of the nights, someone working at the bar said I wasn't allowed to leave with my drink, but this must not have been a hard policy.) I'm not even sure what it was, but the vibe in BnB was not especially fun. I can't pinpoint it, unless it's just that hotel bars swarmed with people wearing name badges are low key depressing. Anyway, I still had a good time at BnB Bistro four nights in a row. I'd recommend it if everyone you want to talk to is already there."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken club,  flatbread pizza,  and pretzel bites.  Everything was excellent, even the French fries that accompanied the dishes. Drinks were vey good also.  Service was excellent,  we were at the bar."}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner while staying at the Sheraton. Since only the late night menu was available, I ordered the build your own burger with a beef patty, lettuce, tomatoes, pickle, lettuce wrap and goat cheese. I was also surprised to find out that for the cost, it also came with either a side salad or French fries. 

The food was delicious and as I mentioned, huge portions for the price. The burger came on a number of lettuce leaves, tomatoes and pickles. The side salad was big enough to be considered another ordered with its balsamic vinaigrette. 

Wait staff was attentive and checked in multiple times to see if I needed anything else. 

They do close the kitchen and bar though by 12:50 I believe."}
{"text":"Great nachos! Huge portion! Definitely not an order for one. Fun atmosphere and surprisingly good for a hotel restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Terrible. I ordered the trio of small plates, for $29. Pork bun was overdone. Tuna taco had 2 paper thin slices of tuna. Mushroom ravioli was literally just 1! ravioli. Maddeningly overpriced hotel restaurant, with mediocre food. In retrospect, I should've looked around. Lots of other places nearby."}
{"text":"The wine was just not good at all at the bar.
Burger was better, as was the salad. Breakfast is good, but $$$$. Fair coffee. Nice atmosphere, accommodating staff."}
{"text":"Good food, (great salmon!), great service, music is a bit loud, calm decor, more expensive than it should be for the quality. Convenient for people staying at the Sheraton hotel, but probably not that great if you're looking for a new place to try."}
{"text":"Went for late night dessert and tea at 11pm on a Tuesday. It was crowded and noisy due to a global conference at the hotel.
The service was a little scattered but friendly.....it took a while for our desserts to arrive, the pie was not warm and the wrong teas were given.
The taste of the apple pie and ginger caramel cake were ok....nothing great.....but it was very expensive ( 2 desserts and 2 teas approx $40)."}
{"text":"Absolutely dreadful. I ordered the \"Mi Amor Burger\" with fries. The burger was clearly a factory-made patty. It was cooked to death. The \"molten brie\" was only partially melted. The fries were lukewarm, and so was the burger. The entire thing tasted like nothing at all. Are you guys aware of salt and pepper? It took 25 minutes to appear in a half-empty bar and it was $21.

It's very difficult to understand how a hotel restaurant with hundreds of covers every day could fuck up a cheeseburger so badly. I would rather starve than eat at this shithole again."}
{"text":"This is a 25 dollar salad. $8 extra to add 5 slices of steak. Salad is tasty! Steak is sub par. Out of the 5 slices 2 were fat. Would try the chicken with the salad but won't order the steak again.  Food has gone down hill over the past year."}
{"text":"I feel bad for giving this place such a low star rating because the ambiance is nice (like any hotel restaurant) and the service is excellent. 

My dad won a gift certificate to B&B. We took advantage of this and I drove down with my sister and aunt for lunch (parking across the street by City Hall is surprisingly reasonable). As appetizers, the calamari and fried pickles were ordered. Both were quite underwhelming. As mains, we ordered entree salads. Unlike the apps, they were outright terrible. 

I would recommend checking out other restaurants in the area should you be hungry. You can get more bang for your buck and actually eat good food elsewhere. 

Good for: meeting point and then walking to another restaurant"}
{"text":"You're run of the mill average hotel bistro. Don't expect great things, and don't expect value."}
{"text":"Was in town for a conference so it was convenient for dinner with some colleagues. Service was largely horrible though I think it may have been our particular server. She seemed annoyed that only one of us ordered a drink upon arrival and then disappeared for over 20 minutes before we could order dinner (and my colleagues drinks now that they had perused the cocktail menu). I ordered what was described on the menu a essentially steak frites (PAN SEARED 8oz NY STRIPLOIN & FRIES). When the server brought my meal she literally tossed it on the table such that almost all of the food flew off the plate. The steak was delicious and correctly prepared medium rare. The rest of the plate was a disaster. There was one single potato-like fry along with a number of near-raw roasted vegetables. The two stars are for the steak and the local IPA - otherwise a zero."}
{"text":"Pretty average hotel restaurant.  Had drinks here and he service was mediocre but the ambience is great.  

They were accommodating to small groups as well as larger groups (had both in two days) and I would have corporate after work drinks here anytime."}
{"text":"We went to the BnB Bistro in the Sheraton Downtown Hotel twice and they were featuring lobster while we were there.

The first time was for lunch.  Their Ceasar Salad was truly excellent, and their Lobster Bisque was absolutely wonderful.  Rafaq was our waiter, and he did a fine job.  Lunch = 4 stars.

However, we went back the next night and had, what was purported to be their lobster roll.  It was truly dreadful.  The roll was hard, and there was barely any meat on the bun.  The only good thing were the waffle-cut fries.  Very disappointing.  Dinner = 2 stars

Sorry, BNB, you only get a 3-star average from me. If you say you have a lobster roll, then make a REAL lobster roll (lots of lobster meat, mayo, maybe a bit of celery if you must, and that's IT, served on a FRESH, toasted lobster roll bun)."}
{"text":"Late night of work so we opted to eat at the hotel's restaurant. Upscale in appearance so I was expecting high prices and was pleasantly surprised to find that the prices were not out of line with similar downtown restaurants. The staff was friendly and efficient. We both ate light. Cobb and Ceasar salad. Great tasting and presentation.
2nd visit has mixed reviews. I had a side salad and Chipotle dry rubbed wings. Both were tasty. Colleague had a burger that wasn't. Server was not very attentive. 
3rd visit was a group meal to celebrate Thanksgiving away from home. It was wonderful. See photo of menu."}
{"text":"Menu looked good and atmosphere is nice but sweet potato fries were cold in arrival and the lobster roll was just weird. More like a tuna fish sandwich than a lobster roll."}
