{"text":"We recently had dinner at Cuff. Drinks were yummy and super delicious.  I ordered a club sandwich which was not great.  My daughter had a chicken Caesar and which was okay.  The prices were a little high as we'll.  I would recommend appetizers and drinks only.  I had high hopes for this place. Hopefully it will improve."}
{"text":"Dinner there tonight for the first time. Absolutely loved the place. Great atmosphere,  great service and great food! Anyone from urban back East, \"this will remind you of that perfect little restaurant with a patio! The one you went to on a perfect summer night!\" Thank you for a perfect birthday dinner. P.s. this is the only review I've ever written! Ever!"}
{"text":"Exciting the food is great so glad that this place is in the Glendale area. Wonderful our dinner was amazing. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Decided to go back to give the restaurant another shot and definitely glad I did.  Restaurant was very quiet and we were seated immediately.  Wanted to sit on the patio on my first visit, but was too warm on this trip.  The ambiance on the interior is very nice and warm.  The attention to detail is impressive, really like the pendant fixtures over bar area.    Our server was very helpful and recommended the calamari as an appetizer.  Was very lightly breaded, which is a plus, and I really liked the spicy drizzle sauce.  Entrees were very good, I had the chicken club and my partner had the pozole.  If you are a traditionalist when it comes to pozole, this isn't for you.  If you enjoy updated spins on traditional dishes, you'll really enjoy it.  The pork wontons in the pozole were great.  Really enjoyed myself and appreciative of this restaurant in an area that has never had much selection.    As a note, the prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor with delicious fresh food. The deviled eggs are great, but the Shrimp & Grits were fantastic. Great combo of sweet and savory topped with a perfect poached egg. Can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today and sat out on the patio. Our waiter was very friendly and just a really nice guy. The food was very good and so were the beers. I love the patio area and today was the perfect day to enjoy the outdoors.  We will be back for dinner and maybe happy hour."}
{"text":"Best place ever! best buttermilk pie!Try it ! Zach makes the best Sangria ever !Happy hour make you happy.  Cuff burger is the best ever! taco Tuesday is best taco ever!   great homey, comfortable, welcoming feeling ever. Everyone is friendly. Great service. Great music. Wonderful time."}
{"text":"Four of us girlfriends were getting together for dinner, and one of the gals chose this place due to location and good reviews. I liked the look of the place, kind of urban trendy. The 4 of us met just after 5 pm on a Thursday night. It was Happy Hour pricing, $2-$3 off regular pricing, which was cool. I had the Pork Belly Tacos, with a small mixed green salad. Both were very tasty. 2 gals had the Tequila Lime Fish Tacos (one had grilled, the other fried fish). Both said it was good. Our 4th gal ordered the Eggplant Parmesan sandwich with a side mixed green salad. All of us finished everything on our plate. One of my girlfriends had a Cosmo. She said it was good, although she felt it was a bit on the small side for what she paid. We all agreed that if this place was in Scottsdale, it would probably be crowded. While we did like that we could easily have a conversation with each other, there weren't enough people there to really give it a good, active vibe. Maybe we were there on a really slow night at a really slow time..."}
{"text":"Food was good,as was ambiance. Old. Western look .... Best drink was there mint chocolate martini, yum"}
{"text":"The brisket was quite good but too fatty. The french fries were alright but there wasn't enough ketchup. The service was slow and somewhat inattentive. There was no ambience in this restaurant. There was no music or mood lighting. FOXNews was on TV and it was just kind of dull. Overall I can say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood place. We went for happy hour - actually really good food and drink at reasonable prices. The wings we exceptionally good. Nice place to grab a bite in Glendale in the afternoon / evening. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Atmosphere : old school, brick, nice small bar, nice patio.  Food: easily some of the best in Phoenix. If this place was dropped in L.A. it would be raking in money. Calamari, brisket, pulled pork, posole were standout favorites.   Beverage: we went through all the signature cocktails and the Moscow mule, and whiskey sour (both spinoffs from the original recipes) were really well done.  Overall : i hope the area takes care of small local gems like this. So much of Phoenix is chain restaurant  garbage found everywhere else in the country. It would be great to have something this good succeed. A must go spot."}
{"text":"New taste and culinary culture to the downtown Glendale area. I had the Burrata OMG the pesto was amazing looking forward to the dinner menu. The chicken club had an amazing twist and the peach vinaigrette  really complemented the mixed green salad.... Tasty experience!!!can't wait to try the Eggplant Parmesan"}
{"text":"Went to Cuff tonight received great service for Megan food was absolutely great had Cajun shrimp andouille sausage and grits grits was cooked perfectly drinks were great thank you for the great service"}
{"text":"Great service. Deviled eggs and calamari,  excellent starters. Thumbs up for main courses enjoyed the pulled pork and shrimp w grits. A great addition for Glendale. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat in Downtown Glendale but they have enough closed their doors, very sad!"}
{"text":"Extremely reasonable. Bartender actually knows how to make an Old Fashion, to perfection. Pork tacos were delicious, pork could melt in your mouth. Girlfriend had the burger, tells me it's superb.  Attentive, friendly wait staff, bar tender is second to none."}
{"text":"I ate there last night and was totally surprised by the great food, prompt table service and attentiveness of the owner. The orange chicken was tasty and not bland at all . In fact nothing was bland about the place or the food! The pork ribs were... well wonderful, saucy and tender. And the fried rice , 3 people at my table went back for more!!! The fried rice!!! It was tasty and mildly seasoned with a wonderful herb, tarragon I think...you have to taste it to believe it!!! So good! The hand made salad dressing, others at my table went back for more salad( we were in a group of 80, and so were served buffet style , thus we could return for seconds). And the location couldn't be better, across from beautiful Glendale Glitters and the Municipal parking garage ( which has no cost in the evening)! Simple And sweet for that Friday date nite or any nite!!"}
{"text":"What wonderful restaurant. The service staff was friendly and helpful. The food was fresh and very flavorful. The braised ribs were amazing and the coconut cream pie was yummy. What a great place, we'll be coming back. The Moscow Mule; super great."}
{"text":"Great food in old downtown Glendale! Variety of sandwiches and entrees including Asian menu makes this a good place. Reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a Friday early evening and enjoyed eating on the patio. The service was great and the food prepared perfectly. If you are in downtown Glendale stop in and have a meal or an appetizer you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A+ : Went downtown to checkout the Glendale Glitters and we were starving and this happened to be the first place we passed. The menu is small but only because they're testing it to get the best selection before making it permanent. Everyone we dealt with was super friendly and awesomely informative. Great architectural details make it cozy and hip. Oh yes and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Reopened.  Happened in at lunch for the first time during their soft reopening.  They open officially on Wednesday 6/23.  We shared an order of Calamari.  Very fresh; light crispy & tasty breading with 2 terrific sauces.  I had The Burger with fries.  Perfectly done; excellent seasoning; very tasty.  My husband had the Chicken sandwich with a very good side salad. Menu is limited but still has something for everyone with a \"twist.\" Learned a lot from the owner & was delighted with everyone we met.  Sounds like some great upcoming additions.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"PLEASE patronize Cuff!  O.F.T.E.N.  Downtown Glendale is always waiting to \"happen\", and it's hard for small, original businesses to make it there.  So travel to Cuff.  It's quirky AND warm, with a spectacular kitchen.  I had the best Moscow Mule I have ever had, you could really taste the balance between the fig vodka and the aperol liqueur they added -- so much more than just ginger beer with some vodka splashed in it.  My Pozole with Pulled Pork Potstickers and Cotija Cheese was extraordinary, as was my companion's Shrimp and Grits.  The \"grits\" were really like exceptionally well made polenta, fluffy and firm, not greasy and sloppy.  So delicious.  I'll return often, hope most of Phoenix will as well!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! The food and service is consistently fantastic! Been going since the beginning of the year, except when they were closed for a bit in the summer. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came here not expecting anything special... It was just another ma' & pa' downtown restaurant. The service was exceptional. I asked for recommendations and the waiter gave me them with extra details on how the food is made. I ordered the Smoked Brisket and was very surprised that it was actually cooked perfect and the flavor was right on the money. The Bloody Marry was also very good. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food. Loved the deviled eggs and pulled pork. Restaurant is super cute and located in downtown glendale. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Food and service was awesome! Beautiful waitress with the dimples! :) The owner stopped and spoke with us, had a very nice chat with him. We had the cheese puffs, cuff burger, shrimp and grits, and posole all very good!!! Will definitely spread the word and come back again."}
{"text":"Great new spot for our family in Glendale. Stopped in after a day of shopping and did not disappoint. Started out with a kids menu which is always helpful. Kailee was a great waitress. She was awesome to our son. We had a party of 5 and lovers everything we had. We had a couple of fish fries, wings, tempura shrimp and the meat and cheese board. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Once again a truly wonderful evening my new friends and fantastic comedians ! The food was once again superb (shrimp mac & cheese with added bacon) + pulled pork tacos. Yummers !!!!!!!!   The staff was outstanding and the crowd truly delightful.  I am sooooooo glad we found this place to enjoy our weekend evening !!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in downtown Glendale.  Well worth the drive. Excellent happy hour specials. Really surprised by how good The Cuff was. A very pleasant and helpful wait staff. Honestly couldn't ask for much more from this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place! Great decor, vibe, food, service and most importantly restrooms! The pride in ownership is apparent in every detail!"}
{"text":"Food is top notch.  Great little place - nice looking and love that it's not a chain."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and have really liked it.  Different take on pork belly and fish tacos, but they are pleasant to the pallet. Good selection of local beer.  Several different cocktails."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday lunch, the food was amazing. Try the cheese bites they are to die for.."}
{"text":"Nice little find, I went in taco Tuesday and ordered the taco plate, portions size was good with lots of meat. Service was good the waitress was super nice"}
{"text":"Thanks for another fun meal! We stopped in before Glendale Glitters for dinner. The staff was friendly and customer focused. We were easily seated with a high chair for our youngest. While we were inside, the back patio seating (with heaters) helped to accommodate more diners. Our burgers, ribs and charcuterie board hit the spot, were perfectly cooked and my sometimes picky children were satisfied. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is the place we have been waiting for! Food is amazing, very fresh ingredients and everything was cooked to perfection. Loved the atmosphere and the cocktails were spot on! We will be back many times, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Downtown Glendale is doing a great job of bringing new \"hipster\" businesses in.  Cuff is a great example of just that.  They took an existing historic building, utilized what was there to preserve as much of the character and charm as possible then added swanky chill vibe of an old time speak easy.  Cuff is a small, quaint place with big potential.  Serving up big taste off a small menu and pouring classic drinks with an upgraded twist.  Whether you're out on date night or meeting up with the squad for happy hour give CUFF a try, I think you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Went to Cuff for dinner and drinks before walking around Glendale Glitters last night, and had a great experience. Weather was nice, so we opted to sit out on the patio. Started with some drinks and a charcuterie board, all of which was very good. I enjoyed an HGT, and my husband had an Old Fashioned, and they were both very well mixed with garnishes that complemented the drinks nicely. The charcuterie board had a good variety of cheeses, meats, olives, nuts, and berries, and was served with a flatbread.  For our entrees, I had the shrimp po boy sandwich, and my husband had the house burger. Both were served with cajun-seasoned fries, and we had no complaints with the food. The shrimp in my sandwich were very good, with a light breading that didn't make the meal feel too heavy. We had a few more drinks, my favorite of which was their house spin on the Moscow Mule. They use a fig-infused vodka that is absolutely delicious, as well as an extra-spicy ginger beer, that really adds a ton of flavor to the drink. We were very happy to see a variety of locally-sourced products on the menu, and that the bar staff were using the herbs planted on the patio for use in their drinks! Doesn't get any fresher than that! We were both very happy with our first visit to Cuff, and would like to come back and check out their other offerings, since it looks like their menu rotates seasonally. We talked to several members of the wait/bar staff, and they were all very friendly and personable, and helped to make our experience so positive.  Definitely recommend for a chill date night, or for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Awesome! We have had lunch there, delicious. Happy hour, great prices, great food and a great location. Downtown Glendale needs this! We had our son's wedding rehearsal dinner there a couple weeks ago. The patio was private, the service excellent and the food, so good that people are still commenting on it.  We were able to go early and decorate and bring our own cake. It was a wonderful experience. We dealt with David the owner of the building, that he renovated beautifully and Chef Tom.  We were treated so well, the staff accommodated all our needs and wants.  Chef Tom also prepared the meat for the wedding the next day, and delivered it to us!! Excellent service and great food!  Thank you to David, Tom and the staff at Cuff for giving  us and our guests a terrific experience! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely divine! Me and the hubby came here for our 15 yr wedding anniversary from suggestions of some friends to try this place & im so glad we did. We had the deviled eggs which were amazing, the bacon just kicks it up a notch. We decided to share a tequila cuff Bloody Mary which was delicious. They added a bacon slice to the veggies as a garnish and this again was good. Hubby ordered the smoked brisket as the main course which by far was divine. It was so good I almost slapped the waiter. I ordered the cuff posole & this was the perfect amount of flavors mended together. They put pork pot stickers in it and the entire dish was also fantastic! I recommend this place 100%. Try brisket or the posole and you won't be disappointed!! We were seated quickly & the waiter was prompt with his service and very gracious. I can't wait to go again!!! Next time it's the Mai Tai cocktail..."}
{"text":"Never had anything but a great experience here! Staff is extremely friendly and accommodating and drinks and food are always delicious!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in the downtown Glendale area.  Food was good, but price to portion size was a little off.  Several of the dishes we had used sweet chili sauce, might be a little more creative.  We had cheese balls, which were like a crab rangoon minus the crab taste, very very deep fired.  About 1-2 minutes less and it would have been better.  Split the shrimp poboy, tasty, but only 5 shrimp on the plate.  Also had the calamari - that was my favorite.  Not a bad little place to go and have a beer and a meal."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Taco Tuesday at Cuff is a Taco Tuesday like no other. The Tequila Lime fried fish tacos were absolutely amazing ... So was the fried garlic green beans. So much better than the ones I make myself!! Lol!   My girlfriends and I went to Cuff this past Tuesday. It was about 8 of us... Zach was our server. He was great!! Calm, funny, attentive, just great! We're definitely returning next month!!"}
{"text":"Cuff has been on our radar for a while. Finally met friends for dinner there. Ordered & enjoyed most of the appetizers. Shrimp & grits - good. Burgers - really good. Cuff is included in Phoenix Magazine 2017 Best of the Valley West Valley cocktail bars - rightly so. Afterwards Went to Off the Cuff for their standup comedy show. Enjoyed that too. It's a good night out."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Our favorite little gem tucked in the heart of Glendale. I love it so much I don't want anyone else to know about it so I can keep it to myself.   Honestly I have so many good things to say; friendly staff, amazing food, KILLER sangria, dog friendly patio **our fave, it feels like home.   Our go-tos are the Sangria 43, crab puffs, a charcuterie board and the sweet chili shrimp. But everything is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were really good. I had shrimp and grits and my husband had the ribs we were really impressed and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went in during Glendale glitters, the server who sat us didn't say a word when seating us. Our server was nice but not attentive, however the lady who I'm assuming was the bartender was very nice. Overall the staff needs some work. The only reason I gave this place three stars is because the food was amazing. The eggplant parmesan sandwich we got was to die for and the mozzarella tasted like it was homemade. It's worth going to for the food, hopefully they'll work on having a more attentive and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Tried Cuff for the first time on Saturday and really enjoyed ourselves. We ordered a Bloody Mary and a Sangria; both were good, albeit a little pricey. For starters we shared the hot wings and deviled eggs. The wings aren't in your traditional wing sauce but whatever they were in was really yummy! The eggs? Pass and make em' at home unless you're just really in the mood for them and don't want to do the work. Everyone liked their dinners - Posole, Chicken Club Sandwich, and Fish Tacos. Portions were generous. The biggest critique? Spice up the white sauce for the tacos. It was bland and really had no flavor so I over-salted my dish to compensate, which was a shame because the tacos themselves were fresh, cooked well, and delicious. We want to try the outdoor dining during the cooler months and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to celebrate her birthday here. We had lunch on a Friday. Our server was very helpful and attentive. We ordered Cuff mules to drink and the burrata as our appetizer. It was so good. I had the cuff burger. It was cooked perfectly. It was topped with cheddar, bacon and caramelized onion. There are 50 billion burger places in Phoenix but this one was very good. I had a mixed green salad on the side with walnuts, cranberries, goat cheese in a pear vinaigrette. I thought I would regret not getting fries on the side, but no I loved the salad. The server raved about this locally made buttermilk pie. We ordered it. Omg I told my friend I had died and gone to heaven. I now have to try Shelley's Bakery where it's made. I will be going to Cuff to try happy hour."}
{"text":"Food..drinks...service...all outstanding.    I am in love with the deviled eggs.  Comedy night is also great."}
{"text":"Yuuuuum to this place. They have the best salad ever! I have been here 4x and I'll return again and again. My husband loves their burger too."}
{"text":"Had first dining experience here last night while we watched Glendale Glitters light up. Very impressed with the food. Especially the deviled eggs and calamari. Very flavorful. Also tried the beef brisket which was also packed with flavor. We were at table up front near window which was perfect to watch festivities. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food and service.  Loved the cherry old fashion.  Very quaint. Great location.  Fresh food awesome salad and cheese puffs."}
{"text":"The super friendly & accommodating staff & a fine cocktail menu make this a great hangout spot. Word is, the Moscow Mules are particularly spectacular."}
{"text":"Getting caught up on my reviews!!!  Met up here with a dear friend recently.  It is a really cute place and I am so glad they have decided to invest in downtown Glendale.  We went during the week, around 5 PM, for catch-up and some beverages.  The menu is small and we ordered a burrata and some deviled eggs.  My friend had wine and I had some cocktails which were lovely.  We met the chef, who shared some of his ideas with us.  The meal itself was enjoyable all around.    I DO have a suggestion though:  our hostess was not very involved during our time there.  It's SO important to engage first-time customers; familiarity with the menu and the ability to make recommendations when asked are the way to create return business.  Ours was virtually non-existent and couldn't answer the most basic questions.  You may want to revisit her training as you build your clientele.  Best of luck to you, Cuff!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. We keep hoping the food will be as good as the first time which was shortly after they opened...but sadly it was not (not same chef we're told). This time we tried the tacos (fish and pulled pork). Had read a review that tacos are dry. Should have believed the person as they are, and just not seasoned well. Gave 3 stars because atmosphere and service are good."}
{"text":"First off, let me say wow. Glendale has a really great gem here. This was only my first time here but won't be the last. 1. Ambience - Casual, yet has a certain upscale feeling to it. With a full bar and outside dinning area. This place can truly be a comfortable place to enjoy a meal anytime of day or year. 2. Food- The chef has a way around the plate. I ordered \"The Burger\". Nothing fancy but a great way to gauge the validity of the restaurant. Also had the Butternut squash soup, outstanding flavor.  3. Wait staff- Respectful, polite, courteous, attentive, and overall friendly. What you would expect from a waiter/waitess.   Overall, my girlfriend and I had a great time trying this new place in downtown glendale, enjoying a beer and burger while music played in the background. While this was the first time to Cuff Kitchen,  it will not be the last. I highly recommend it to you.   Remember to support your local restaurants and stores."}
{"text":"They have the strongest Mai Tai in the West... for sure.  The burger was fresh and cooked to perfection. Cajun fries were yummy as well. My husband's fish tacos were good but a little dry.  He says they needed a creaminess added to them, he still enjoyed them.  The drinks are great and strong.  The bartender is great!  She is very friendly and mixes a great drink."}
{"text":"Super fun, funky drinks.  A great variety of appetizers,  not the boring basic appetizers. Our table tried several tacos and loved them all.  We will be back and bring our friends for another fun night."}
{"text":"Been eating at Cuff's since they opened. Stopped by for lunch today and had a fabulous smoked brisket. There Hot & Sour soup is out of the park great. Friendly staff and a great bar. They have a young staff with great attitudes willing to learn. Try the 43rd Ave Sangria. A great drink for a warm  or hot day"}
{"text":"Service was ok.  A little slow starting, but it picked up.  I had the shrimp po boy.  The shrimp was spot on.  Flavor was good.  The bread was not traditional.  Traditionally it is made with French bread, this was more a store bought sub roll.  It couldn't hold everything.  French fries were mediocre.  Also, we started with the calamari.  For the price the serving was much smaller than the average place.  There was  a lot of the coating underneath vs. calamari.  Flavor was fine, but a little spicy for my taste. I had a martini and it was o.k.  Pluses:  Interesting whiskeys/liqours,  neat atmosphere, interesting menu Cons:  Slower service, food presentation, martini taste, closes at 10 p.m. on a Saturday"}
{"text":"The best spot in DT Glendale. The lettuce wraps, chicken club, braised ribs, and coconut pie are all bomb. They have a solid and unique cocktail menu. Check it out- especially on the way to a game out at WestGate."}
{"text":"What a great little gem in downtown Glendale!  Our family of five enjoyed the eclectic menu of both the food and beverage options.  David was an attentive host who made us feel right at home.  We love supporting small businesses, especially the ones that go the extra mile.  We were seated promptly (we made a reservation), our server was always checking in but never hovering.  Our menu questions were answered with confidence and the food was fresh and interesting.  We had the cheese puffs (yes!), and I was told the salad and fish tacos were excellent, though I didn't try either.  I did sample my daughter's \"fish fry\" and really liked it.  However, I was the table winner with the old style posole!  Get it.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice night at Cuff. First time there. Good menu. Great drinks!  Seriously nice pours!!  Nice ambiance.  Hip. Trendy. There's a comedy club next door.  Did not check that out. Tasty shrimp and grits. Great brisket. Great service. Would totally go back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal with friends.  Ordered a bottle of wine to share. We ordered the fish fry and the 3 different kinds of tacos offered on the menu. My Baja fish tacos was awesome and my favorite! Great friendly service!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things. Came here for lunch during the week, and we were able to enjoy the patio out back. The cocktails were creative and yummy (love that they use local ingredients and flavors), and the food was good too. It's such a cozy place, and the flavors are upscale/craft, without being snotty. Great gem in Downtown Glendale"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. All of it.  Plus there's a comedy club next door, off the cuff that's worth checking out Saturday nights!"}
{"text":"We had the short ribs and the posole, both were the delish!  The posole was soooooo good! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Well I asked for one thing, never got it. Server has been rude and sassy since we sat down. Literally got upset when we asked to split the tab after our drinks were ordered. \"You're supposed to do that first\". Sangria took literally 20 minutes, and the fries were mediocre. Honestly if it wasn't for it being Glendale Glitters, I wouldn't be here. Nor would I come back."}
{"text":"This is a darling little restaurant in the heart of old town Glendale.  The service was extremely friendly, and the chef was extremely attentive. The menu is surprisingly brief; a few appetizers, a few sandwiches, and a few entrees. I ordered a Malbec wine which was served chilled. When I asked for my red wine at room temperature, the server replaced my glass with wine that was so sour that it tasted like vinegar. I didn't complain - it's a new place and I'm sure they are working out the kinks. However, no red wine drinker I know of, drinks their wine chilled.  Anyway, I ordered the Cuff Posole, which I was told by the server that people love so much that one customer liked his plate. It was OK. I'm not a smoked pork fan, and it seems almost every dish consists of smoked pork. I'd prefer it with chicken.  My husband ordered the eggplant parm sandwich. It was delicious and the salad that came with was equally delish.  I'd like to see more variety on the menu, more dishes made with chicken, and my red wine served at room temp!"}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Glendale, great place to grab a quick burger or pork sandwich! Been here many a time with colleagues, the food keeps bringing us back!"}
{"text":"Yummmm we love Cuff! Best hidden little Gem in Downtown Glendale!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best service ever!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing burger and Cajun fries yesterday.  Along with the best bread pudding ever!!   Service was quick and very friendly server."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome food. It's so nice to have a great restaurant in downtown Glendale that is reasonably priced and delicious!! Check out happy hour, we plan on being regulars!!"}
{"text":"Today I went for first time to Cuff's for a family lunch and was blown away with the atmosphere, service and food that was amazing. Our party of 6 were actually sharing small bites of each other's orders as the food was so delicious. Even from my basic caesar salad with shrimp to the Braised short ribs, everyone was saying how delicious every ones food was. I will be going back there very soon to take my son who was not able to join us. Anyone who reads this you will be beyond happy giving this fairly new Glendale restaurant a visit."}
{"text":"Found this gem accidentally on a trip to AZ in June.  We happened to stop by on the very day of their grand opening!  The atmosphere is really laidback and chill.  I ordered an Eggplant Parm Sandwich and it was the best eggplant I think I've ever had.  I was sorry to finish it.  We also ordered the Spicy Sweet Crispy Calamari and it was so delicious. I couldn't believe how amazing the food was.  As a visitor from New York, I guess I was a little shocked to find food that rivaled some of NY's finest.  The service was phenomenal.  Our waitress was really sweet and helpful with choosing what we wanted.  I wish I lived in AZ just so I could go to Cuff again!"}
{"text":"Went for Dinner. Wife had the Pork sandwich, would not order it again, they put a lot of hot pepper flakes. I had the Shrimp & Grits, no flavor would not order again."}
{"text":"Tried the place for the first time on \"Taco Tuesday.\" We ordered two different kinds of fish tacos and were delighted with the quality of ingredients and delicious recipes. I had a happy hour exotic variation of a Margarita and loved it. We split a Key lime pie and felt as full as an overstuffed sofa. The place is so tastefully decorated and the service so good that we were shocked to find that our tab was less than $30! We plan to be back soon..."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I really wanted to like this place. My friend and I always pass it on our commute. A few weeks ago, we decided to try it. There is a small bar with maybe six seats, not a lot of tables and a patio. The decor is nice and it's a really cute place. Some guys at the bar suggested the chicken wings and said they were delicious. We ordered the chicken wings and tacos. The chicken wings didn't have much sauce on them and smelled really weird. I'm not joking, they had a weird smell. And, they tasted terrible. The tacos came plain with some kind of sauce and coleslaw on the side. It was one small piece of fish on a tortilla that didn't even taste like it was warmed. The wine was expensive and it was \"happy hour.\" The food was terrible, prices are high and the only reason I gave this place two stars is because of the nice bartender. I believe his name was Zach. It wasn't a good experience."}
{"text":"You have got to try this place! The people were great and the food was even better. When you walk in you instantly get the urban old town feel and you are welcomed by an old school bar and friendly staff. The place was very clean and everything in its place. This was my second trip and I had a great time on both occasions.  Had the Charcuterie Board, Wings (Never had wings with this taste, very tasty) and Barrata (Barrata where have you been all my life) for appetisers. Chicken Club and Shrimp Po'boy for dinner. The dishes came out picture perfect and they tasted great. Great place for two or for a family. Let's help them keep this place open."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to this restaurant but read about it in Phoenix magazine and on holiday (at the wonderful Biltmore) thought it would be nice to visit Glendale. Big problem why is there a very small and \"sweet and sour pork\" Chinese menu at Cuff? Something is not right.   Po boy w terrible sub Subway bread, not properly cooked fries wring lettuced Caesar - what no Romain in Arizona  and a too saucey shrimp and grits. Cant figure it out but it needs ti be fixed!"}
{"text":"Great place! In behalf of my friends Alma, Karen, Serena & I. Good atmosphere. Yummy food. We definitely see us going back with a love one or friend again. Excellent service and clean establishment as well :)"}
{"text":"The new Cuff ain't what it used to be. We haven't been here in a while and apparently it changed ownership. In the past it was like they had a chef and now it is like they have a line cook. Still decent but not awesome."}
{"text":"What a fantastic new restaurant!! This area really needs a place like this! I was with my family walking down Glendale Ave when we ran into the owner, Tom. He came up and started talking to us about his new place down the street. He was so friendly so we instantly had to check this new place out. What an excellent decision it was! Immediately upon entering I saw the copper mugs and knew they served moscow mules. Tom told us about their house made fig infused vodka for the moscow mules and we quickly ordered 3. Extremely well crafted and absoloutely delicious!! I could have easily down 3 of those! Since we were heading to Haus Murphy's after our cocktails for dinner, we only ordered an appetizer. We ordered the meat/cheese/olive plate and wow oh wow!!! It was only $10 and well worth it. 3 of us split it and it was a perfect snack with our moscow mules! The staff was incredibly friendly and talkative as well. Tom gave us a tour of the restaurant as well. He showed us the original brick wall towards the back, which was a very nostalgic touch to leave in the place. The patio wasn't quite finished, but it will be awesome once done! Love the beautiful iron gate! Hopefully this new place gets the recognition it deserves and more people come to check this out! Glendale definitely needs a cool place like this! Tom made us feel so welcome and privileged too to be a part of this new establishment!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. I liked the Cajun fries. I just had a burger. Burger was good, nothing too special. Had the hefenweizen-$5 not too bad. Went on a Friday night at 8.... it was us and one other group there. Pretty dead, I don't know the area very well, but being a young person, I wouldn't go back at night. Maybe if I'm in the area and for lunch. Says happy hour is 3-6... that may be worth it"}
{"text":"Amazing! My wife and I love this place! They have REAL top shelf Long Island ice teas. (Hard to find in Phoenix). But the item that keeps us coming back is the grits with shrimp and sausage. It's awesome! My wife hates grits but this dish just works for some reason. We highly recommend it along with the Long Island. It's a hole in the wall but it's a great place to come and enjoy an amazing meal."}
{"text":"The ambiance is very pleasant.  We sat outside next to the herb garden and enjoyed trying to guess the different aromas.  The food was not bad either.  The Mac and cheese with shrimp and bacon was ok and the brisket was ok too.  The winner was the Cajun fries."}
{"text":"The waitress was lovely making sure the drinks were full, we were happy, and we weren't rushed at all despite being there a long time just chatting. Food was great and I highly recommend the calamari appetizer and shrimp po'boy. My friend got the chicken club and member several times how good it was. The only thing that was unpleasant women sitting at the table next to ours were having a very ugly conversation, but I can't fault them for some their patrons being insufferable. Next time I come in I'm going to try the shrimp and grits. It's a really neat setting and I'd have no problem returning or recommending them to a friend."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! We wandered in here with a big party and they accommodated us without a wait! The lemon chicken was out of this world! Easily the best chicken I've ever ordered at a restaurant. Was extremely surprised and satisfied. Thanks for great service and a great meal!"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere and think if the hours were more regular more people would come. I enjoyed the cheese,meat and olive tray.. sorry forgot the formal name... but it was great. The Mules we had were really good but we only had one because the were pricey.. and we are not cheap with drink cost. The entres were good but not fantastic. We didnt take the leftovers home. That was a sign. I mean it wasnt bad but I am not dying to go back."}
{"text":"Inconsistent  I loved the meal I had last time in this very cute small historic area of Glendale. They still do serve up hand crafted above average cocktails in an old charm atmosphere and offer an American Comfort Food Menu with comfortable prices.  The brisket was so darn great last time I decided to order it.  It was not the same as last time as it was kind of dry. It still had a tasty flavor but was not that fresh kind of melt in your mouth kind of brisket. The brisket did have some fat to it but it just seemed like leftover meat with fat. It was still passable and not bad but also not great like last time. The slaw was ok and the fries were hot and fresh but boarder line over salted. For me they were hard to eat but my husband ate them. I would still recommend to try the brisket because if you hit them on a good day the brisket might be outstanding.  Based on the shrimp and grits my husband had I would not recommend the shrimp and grits. A small mound of grits sat in the bottom of the bowl and was topped with a large amount of red sauce that diluted the grits into nothing but soup. It became just red sauce mixed with grits that got worst from the undercooked poached egg on top that had some raw whites that did nothing positive to this dish. My husband ate it without sending it back. I would not have been able to eat his dish.   I hate like hell to drop this place a star and HOPE that maybe the regular cook was just off that night.  You should still give this place a try when in the area I just wanted to keep my review honest."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last evening. This is wonderful restaurant. They have been open about 4 week. The service was excellent, atmosphere was excellent, can't beat the prices and most important the food was outstanding!  We drove from Surprise and will definitely go back frequently. Was well worth the 35 mile each way drive. If you fancy Calamari you will be in AWE of this dish. And a very generous serving, shared by 4. I had the Pork Belly tacos for my entree, superb!  Others had shrimp poorboy, and pork roast sandwich. Everyone loved their food. Not one complaint. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I drove by this place a couple times and notice it was new. Then I read about it in the paper and thought why not give it a shot. Cuff is a very nice addition to old downtown Glendale. The decor is pretty sweet looking when u first walk in. It has a modern, yet old school neighborhood bar feel to it. I like restaurants that are by the street to have big windows. To me its gives the restaurant life as you see the world around you passing by. Cuff has a huge window in front. Which when Glendale Glitters kicks off in about a month the view from Cuff should be fantastic.  The food felt pretty standard to me. I had the fried shrimp po'boy and it wasn't spectacular, and it wasn't bad either. The fries that came with it had a nice seasoning over it and they were very crispy. I just stuck with water so I don't know how good their drinks are. I will try Cuff again. Like I said its a nice addition to the town."}
{"text":"Good spot in Glendale with a pretty interesting variety of food types. We went for happy hour and got the burrata to start, followed by the fish tacos (for me) and the eggplant parm sandwich (for my friend). I'd definitely recommend all three of those dishes (I didn't try the eggplant but my friend loved it), and I would come back here to try other things as well."}
{"text":"I've been \"living\" in Glendale for 4+ weeks for work and just happened upon Cuff in Old Town Glendale.  The brisket is incredible. The food is very good and reasonably priced.  The staff seems a bit frazzled and overworked but very polite and friendly.  They have a decent happy hour from 3-6."}
{"text":"And I'm not in a rush to go back, either.  But all four of us said our meals were good.  The menu is minimal to say the least.  One page of food (mostly sandwiches), one page of drinks and the last page a Chinese menu.  I had the pulled pork, two had hamburgers (overcooked) and one had grilled fish tacos.  Their salad sides were very good.  We got there at 6pm on Friday and there were only 5 other people eating.  They got a little busier closer to 7.  But my take - their very limited menu doesn't offer enough choices.  Only one waiter, which says they weren't expecting a crowd.  If I were in Glendale for something else, I'd probably stop at Cuff's.  But probably only at lunch."}
{"text":"Weird mid-size bar in downtown Glendale. The front door sticks- I couldn't open it. A man came (who I presume is the owner) and promptly ridiculed me for not being able to open it. As we sat and ate our dinner, a Cuff employee also got stuck outside- unable to get the door open.   About the food- the menu is interesting- lots of vegetarian options (not vegan). The happy hour menu offered almost everything at a dollar off, so that was cool.  Unfortunately the execution of the food was off. My friend ordered the shrimp po'boy which was the hit of the night. I ordered calamari and grilled fish tacos. The calamari breading didn't stay on- and was extremely greasy. The fish tacos were very soft, and almost underdone and completely unseasoned. They were accompanied by delicious dipping sauces- but still- a little salt & pepper would have gone a long way.   Overall, this place isn't my favorite, and unless we just happened to be in the area- I probably wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"I am a local. I Love this place. The food and the service is great. Please join me to fill out this form to recommend Cuff to my favorite show on PBS, \"Check Please\" by clicking on the link below to make your recommendation. http://www.azpbs.org/checkplease/be_a_guest.php  Thank you."}
{"text":"Downtown Glendale is in desperate need of more places like Cuff where you can get a delicious meal and cocktail in a welcoming and clean environment.  I can rave about the filet mignon I had the first time I came and then I brought a friend back and we shared some deviled eggs.  Everything I've eaten has been absolutely delicious.  Their cocktail menu is short but has everything you need - very tasty whiskey drinks.  The establishment is clean, the decor is casual and the seating is comfy, its the kind of place that you'd want to stay a while and lose track of time over great food and drinks with friends.  So why only 4 stars?  I've been three times and the staff is consistently aloof and working on their disappearing act.  They don't appear to have any career servers, but young people who may be on their first job, which is totally fine but they aren't supervised or given direction.  I think I pinpointed the manager because I hear her ask the staff to do things for her but it's obvious that she's a fish out of water and she usually has a scowl on her face.  I really hope they can get some good help because Cuff is 5 stars in everything else."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Narrow and Perfect.  Good drinks.  Yummy food.  Had HH specials one time.  No complaints"}
{"text":"This place has great potential and I'm looking forward to trying again when they've been open a bit longer.  First of all, hooray for another interesting place in downtown Glendale! They get an extra star just for the location. And the burger I ordered was awesome- probably the second or third best I've had in the Valley at this price point ($10 ish for a burger with fries). Hubs had brisket that they were smoking out back and it had a nice little kick to it. We also ordered the meat and cheese platter, which was all right but nothing special. They had to bring the listed olives separately because they forgot them on the platter. I also saw a table nearby sending back food because it wasn't what they had ordered (issue with getting a side dish right I think). Service was friendly but a bit slow and disorganized. Hopefully they get that together soon because this could be a great West Valley staple. I also wonder if they will do something to integrate with the community theater that is right next door. Dinner and a show could be a fantastic deal there."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Glendale to relax!  I absolutely love their burger and the sangria was delicious. Glendale's newest and best!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place!  Excellent Caesar salad and good service I will return to try the posole!"}
{"text":"Love this Glendale gem.  The infused cocktails are out of this world!!!! Decided on the copper cup (Moscow Mule). It's so good I won't try anything else!!!! The brisket is not traditional but really tasty. I have also had the Pasole and the fish fry... All very good.  Great atmosphere, cool patio, and reasonable prices. Owner and staff care. We need more restaurants like this in downtown Glendale... As a matter of fact we need more like this on the west side!!! Great job Cuff!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Cuff because one of our favorites had too long of a wait. The iced tea was probably the best I've ever had at a restaurant! I ordered the fish fry, and it was so light and flaky! The Cole slaw was fresh and delicious, and the Cajun fries were amazing! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"THIS DELICIOUS PLACE IS OPEN AGAIN!!!! Sitting at their bar end enjoying some cocktails and a mean michelada from Chris.  Pork belly tacos and fish tacos were great on a hot day!  Happy hour is killer and we will be back for dinner here very soon."}
{"text":"Not sure where to go with this so I will stay neutral.  I have a had a hamburger and another sandwich here and they were OK.  The staff seemed disorganized both times. I went back a couple of days ago to try the eggplant sandwich and they have closed for 2-3 months for summer vacation.  Say what? It's only the end of April."}
{"text":"Great patio area food and service were what I would have expected. Great spot for a nice relaxing afternoon."}
{"text":"I LOVE going to Cuff! The food there is always DELICIOUS plus they have a great drink menu! It's awesome because their American restaurant is linked to Zang (an Asian bistro just around the corner) so you can order off of either menu. This makes it a great spot when you can't decide where to eat because there is a wide array of options. They also have a pastry chef so save room for dessert!   Aside from the great food & drinks I enjoy the atmosphere in the restaurant and the staff has always been friendly."}
{"text":"Gave them a second chance.  A complete 180 degree difference. Came in on Saturday evening and it was very busy again, but the service was outstanding as was the food.  I observed others diners around us also getting great service.  They definitely made changes.  The food was great also.  Had the deviled eggs again and they were still great.  The pork belly tacos were fantastic as was the pot sticker posole.  I wanted to lick the bowl.  There was a filet mignon special on the menu tonight.  I want to try everything on the menu now.  It is so nice having a great restaurant like this in downtown Glendale so close to home.  Will be back again and agaiin.  Thanks Tom Harvey for opening this restaurant and the great service."}
{"text":"Nice pub/restaurant in historic Glendale. Known for their cocktails, we tried their Bloody Mary. It was just average...two different types of liquor really watered it down. We also had the chicken club sandwich, which is pretty standard."}
{"text":"Went here to check out this new spot with another \"industry\" friend of mine. Very small menu, but everything we tried was very good. Nice spice on the brisket and layers of flavors in the deviled egg app. Eggplant parmigiana  sandwich had lots of melting cheese and the chunky tomato sauce was served on the side, which I liked because I don't care for too much sauce.  A decent wine and alcohol list. Service was sincere and attentive. The only gripe, we were there in the evening the lighting was insanely bright-almost made us wanna turn around and leave, but we soon adjusted. Clean and organized flow to the dining room. Maybe adjust lighting for dinner service."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight to try something new, it was pretty disappointing. We got calamari and deviled eggs for appetizers and the eggs were average and the calamari was chewy. The brisket my friend ordered was more like pot roast and the po boy sandwich was dry with over-ripe tomatoes that were mushy and grainy. We didn't drink, so I can't comment on those.  The menu is small enough where you'd expect everything on it to be good, but nobody was impressed and we won't be coming back.   2 stars for good service."}
{"text":"Great everything.  The Mac & cheese is especially good. The adults started stealing from the kids' meals..."}
{"text":"The best  Sangria #43!! Just stopped in for cocktails before heading down the street for pizza. Will definitely be returning, yes for cocktails and to check out the menu."}
{"text":"We have been to the Cuff several times. We stopped last evening for dessert and wine. We had the Japanese Cheese Cake and it was to die for. The best we have ever had. We will continue going back. Love the atmosphere,  David  and all the workers - all so pleasant.  Glendale should truly appreciate and support this excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"Cuff is a delicious New American restaurant with a full bar. I ordered the Braised (Short) Ribs with sweet BBQ sauce and Cajun fries. The meal came with a small side salad with a sweet, tangy dressing, cucumbers, grapes, and blackberries. It was absolutely delicious!   For dessert, I had a few bites of Buttermilk Pies with caramel sauce--which was made in-house :).  Try this place if you're looking for something new and are tired of the mundane menu items found elsewhere."}
{"text":"Finally! West-siders rejoice! Cuff is in Glendale, and it's not a biker bar OR a Westgate chain restaurant either. It's a beautifully curated New American restaurant and bar w/ serious mixology under their sleeves. AND it's awesome!  The menu = well thought out, but nice and concise  The food = well-executed and delicious  The cocktails = on point, boozy, and well-crafted  The staff = attentive and knowledgeable   The vibe = 10/10  We ordered the Desert Breeze and the Glendale Thistle to start. Both were enchanting. The Glendale Thistle was a figgy/date garnished spin on an Old Fashioned, but served without ice and in a stemmed cocktail glass. The Desert Breeze featured an herbaceous, earthy tequila-like spirit called Ocho Cientos Blanco Sotol. So good, not your mother's (well, not my mother's) tequila cocktail either. It was strong, vegetal, citrusy, but not sweet. The flavors were refreshing and complex.   For food, we absolutely destroyed an order of the Deviled Eggs as an appetizer, which were garnished w/ pecan wood smoked bacon (yes), The Burger w/ fries, and the Pork Shoulder Sandwich w/ Caesar Salad. All great, but the Deviled Eggs were my favorite part of the meal.  If you live in the West Valley, you're crazy not to frequent this place. If you live in any other part of The Valley, this spot is WELL worth the drive. Do yourself a favor, eat and drink here as soon and as often as possible!"}
{"text":"I had a reservation for 12 ladies for April 17th and luckily one of my friends called with a question to get a recording to say they are closed for the summer.  I would not patronize a restaurant that values their customers so little as not to call to explain their closing. I now have less than a week to find another restaurant.  Cuff will certainly be off our list for next year."}
{"text":"As a foodie this place has been on my radar. I happened to be in the area and I'm so glad I stopped by! GREAT craft cocktails! The Old Fashioned is top notch! No joke...in comparison to other well noted establishments this is on the top of my list! Oh and the food is delicious...I tried their version of posole and the spice factor did not disappoint! It had some traditional aspects mixed with Asian style...well done. AND the service is wonderful! Laid back yet trendy environment...l'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Update to my recent review of Cuff.  To their credit, Tom Harvey contacted me with a heartfelt apology and addressed all of my concerns in the most genuine way.  Cuff also now has gift cards available to which I purchased two this morning and hope our guests enjoy a nice evening and dinner.  We want Cuff to be successful here in Glendale and trust with a few tweaks and Tom Harvey's willingness to satisfy customers in any way he can, Cuff will be a town favorite. We will continue to be supportive patrons."}
{"text":"Great food amazing service. The prices are super reasonable! Great cocktails GREAT beers! It was very busy during an event and they still found room for us and as quickly as they could. Just a very cute environment! Perfect place for date night.perfect place for drinks after work. Just a really rad restaurant. Megan was awesome!! Consistently followed through and made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to Glendale.  We really needed some more interesting cuisine over here, too many chain restaurants.  Good food, drinks, décor and location.  We enjoyed drinks and some appetizers.  Will go back soon to try the pork sandwich that I have heard so much about.  We were just not able to eat any more after the generous portions we received at the bar.  We are planning on dinner soon to see Glendale Glitters from their large front windows."}
{"text":"We went here and we're blown away with our experience. All their staff was able to provide us everything we need. Very eclectic menu! All the food we ordered was good and very large portions! Could easily split an order! Be going back!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place!!  The food is unique and delicious, the space is cozy, and the service is always wonderful!  This is one of my \"little gems\" on the West side of Phoenix:)"}
{"text":"Great Bar, not so Great bar food, Calamari was ok but over cooked, GF Ordered Brisket it was not Brisket was more like a chuck roast that had been smoked and way over cooked Brisket should never need a steak knife to cut it. This may have been an off night because it looked nothing like other posters have taken pics of. I had shrimp and grits, Tasty but the over poached Rubbery Shrimp and Lumpy Grits were a bit of a turn off.  I'm so torn on returning."}
{"text":"Cuff offers a much-needed break from the chain restaurants that abound in the Glendale-Peoria area. Its location in a historic building in old-town Glendale gives it an authentic ambiance. Clearly this is a locals' favorite. We chose to eat at the bar rather than at one of the tables. The friendly people on both sides of the bar made us feel 100% welcome. There's a \"family-feel\" among the employees, and they clearly take pride in the delicious original dishes and cocktails they've created. Excellent craft beers on draft.  We arrived and had to depart too early for the comedy shows next door, but apparently that's a plus as well. We'll put this place on our must-do list for future Spring Training trips."}
{"text":"First time in and it was very nice. Just had time for one cocktail and an order of deviled eggs. Can't wait to come back when we can spend some time and try a few menu items. Great to have a nice place in the area."}
{"text":"The food was reasonably priced, we tried the burger and the chicken club - both were pretty good! Downtown Glendale really needs more restaurants like this to revamp that area. I gave it a 3, I would rate it a 3.5 if it were an option. I rated it this way mainly because of the ambience or lack of it.  It would be awesome if Cuff decided to offer beer on tap, music outside on the patio and possibly some new tables/chairs outside."}
{"text":"Had fish and chips ate outback good service and food was good. Probably the best place to eat on that street."}
{"text":"Cuff was a total surprise.  I have lived in Glendale since 1978 and its the kind of place you dream would be here.  Great food, great service, and very \"cool\" vibe.   The owner took the time and money to bring the place back to retro time look and feel.  Great for date nights, lunch and the food will surprise the pallet with a huge variety of menu items across French cuisine to Thai.    Make the trip over, you wont be disappointed.  Loved it."}
{"text":"To start with this place is a small relaxed restaurant. I love it's laid back feel. All the servers seem nice and relaxed. I sat at the bar and the bartender gave good service and mixed a good drink.   There was a new trainee and he was nice if not a little lost as all trainees are. They were the only 2 people I had interaction with.   Food: I decided to try the deviled eggs and fish tacos with a tequila lime sauce. 2 things that probably should not be severed together but both were tasty.   My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the food was good but not great. Nothing was wrong but nothing was special. The deviled eggs tasted like grandma's deviled eggs good but not great. Same with the fish tacos good but not great. I have had better version of both.   I would come back but try other items"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised to find this place. The atmosphere is lovely, friendly staff, clean, and a hip vintage style decor. More importantly, the food we ordered was fresh and delicious. We had the pork shoulder sandwhich and the Amalfi style lemon chicken, both delicious."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  Service was great too even though we came in pretty late mid-week.    Peoria/Glendale doesn't have many good options that aren't chains.  This place is really refreshing."}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood and decided to try Cuff. I'm happy I ordered their Cuff Burger. It was delicious! They also had local craft brew which I will be coming back to enjoy."}
{"text":"Quaint little place.  We went here for dinner while on a business trip but to me it is more like a lunch restaurant.  I personally prefer a wider selection.  I ordered a pear ale which was light and fruity and I enjoyed it.  For dinner I ordered the brisket with a field green, goat cheese and pecan salad topped with a peach vinaigrette.  The brisket was moist and fell apart like it should with a South Carolina BBQ sauce that was really good, with a tiny little kick.  My salad was fresh and crisp and the dressing was flavorful.  It also came with coleslaw which I could tell was made fresh as it was very crisp and I enjoyed it. Our server was friendly, courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"Went to dinner before Glendale Glitters. Our waitress, Julia was great. She was very attentive and helpful in answering all our questions. Food was good with nice sized servings. I had brisket, my husband had chicken club. They serve brisket with fries. I got a side salad for another side. Food was delivered hot and delicious. Would recommend this place for a quick lunch or dinner. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Glad to see they have closed. Had great food but TERRIBLE service. Glendale can do much better. there many better options in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"Meh.....wanted to like this place. Trendy look, nice staff, nice patio. Had the Cocktail Week special menu. The blood orange Margarita was \"ok\". The grilled fish tacos were pretty tasteless and the tortillas were weirdly hard/browned. The Moscow mule cocktail was good. The brisket was on the dry side and the mustard glaze was strong. The apples in the apple pie were a little crisp. Service was somewhat slow for there only being a few parties.  *** Update: my friend was sick to her stomach later that night"}
{"text":"Ordered the Brisket for lunch and it was the BEST I've ever tasted. Been to KC, Missouri many times where they are famous for bbq and this beats all hands down.   My husband had the Chicken Club and he LOVED IT!  It was so moist and full of flavor.   The service was great and the Chefs were congenial.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The group all enjoyed their meals, braised ribs, fish tacos, brisket. We had the place to ourselves that day. Great service, unique restored restaurant. Some of us wanted the key lime pie but were disappointed they had limited slices. Similar to another visit when there was no pie. Kitchen needs to plan ahead. Guests liked the buttermilk pie but not the thick gummy coconut pie."}
{"text":"Cuff is by far one of my favorite restaurants ! Super friendly staff & comforting vibe. The tunes seem to always be on point. The bartender makes fantastic drinks & the waitresses are very attentive & kind. They have multiple vegan options which is amazing  definitely come try them out & enjoy yourselves"}
{"text":"Got the brisket ad butternut squash soup.  Brisket is NC style which I like.  Brisket was tender and fork ready.  Soup was very creamy and had pomeganate in it which was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Stopped in while attending Glendale Glitters. Seasoning on the fries was slightly spicy for me personally. The ranch dressing and tarter sauce both tasted funny to me. The brisket Carolina sauce was heavy on the lime flavor. Cole slaw had no flavor, just cabbage. Overall I was disappointed especially considering the prices they charge.  Positive comments: The fish was good, restrooms were very nice & the staff was great!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place since it's one of the few places that isn't a chain on this side of town.  The good things:  the staff is really nice.  The food was ok.  I ordered the eggplant parm sandwich and their Paloma.  The sandwich was dry and not very tasty.  The drink was a little flat.  Disclaimer:  I am a vegetarian so the options were limited.  Overall the food was not tasty"}
{"text":"Really good food exceptional service at reasonable prices that can't be beat you'll love it! Cool atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have moved around a bit over the last few years. One of the first things we try to do upon arriving in a new city: find a \"home\" bar.  This is the first place we'll think to go to, and it's where we take any visitors first. It took us seven months to find that kind of place in Glendale, but Cuff is it.  I was honestly shocked when I walked through the front door. This is a \"downtown\" bar with a local feel. That's a tough line to walk (both in appearance and on the menu) but Cuff makes it seem effortless.  Chris was one of the most passionate bartenders I've spoken to. You could tell that he sincerely loved making tasty cocktails and coming up with interesting drinks. The food was also excellent.   It's only been a week since our initial visit and I can't wait to go again. Great ambiance, and they do a lot of their own infusions for cocktails. Awesome."}
{"text":"The Cuff is a must if you are in downtown Glendale. The food is fantastic like your in an upscale Scottsdale restaurant. The eggplant parmigiana was the best I've ever had and the butternut squash soup is to die for. My friends had the pork sandwich and shrimp grits and raved about them too!"}
{"text":"So yummy. I had the vegan black bean burger and Cajun fries! The mixed drinks were sooo good! Great job!  Lovely atmosphere and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and delicious cocktails..... the food was okay, nothing special. The cheese and meat board was good and went well with the cocktails  we tried. I had the HGT and it was wonderfully refreshing and well prepared. The pork belly tacos were horrible ... a big chunk of meat in between a tortilla with some BBQ sauce.... not much more to it. The salad was decent and the French fries were actually super tatsy."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Best pork belly tacos EVER! Great cuisine GREAT prices - check it out! CUFF will not disappoint - quaint charming place w excellent! Service"}
{"text":"Came here to try a new place to have a family birthday lunch. It was really good. We ordered the calamari and egg rolls to start. Then we ordered different entrees to all try. The honey sesame chicken was excellent.  The curry dish had pork and shrimp, the pork had a sweet flavor to it and was really good. My sister loved her shrimp and grits and my son finished the entire peppered beef dish. The portions were large, we were pleasantly surprised.  The only downfall was the website said they closed at 3 so we hurried to get there by 1 to find out they don't close and happy hour is from 3 to 6. I would definitely go back and refer my friends"}
{"text":"Affordable, traditional eats with great value make Cuff an accessible spot that's woefully overlooked.  The eats are predominately American, with accessible sandwiches like burgers (which are good) and eggplant parmesan (which was really good), but with a southwestern (Tequila-lime fish tacos, posole) and Louisianan (Cajun fries, Po' Boys, Grits) flair.   The happy hour is absolutely solid! You can grab some lunches on the cheap. I'm talking 8-10 bucks for a sandwich and fries, which aren't mind-blowing but still felt like a steal for the quality you're getting. The happy hour alone makes Cuff worth it.  One can also spy a modest cocktail menu to wash these down with. I'd enjoyed one featuring gin and thyme. While refreshing and well-presented, it lacked the complexity to make it a true premium beverage. You can't just throw sprigs of stuff in there...you kinda have to muddle it or something, ya know? Take it to the next level.   I do like this place, but I think my four stars is going to be more of a reflection on value than quality. Still not a place to overlook if you're in downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"Finally got to visit The Cuff after a long wait. Decided to try it out during the Glendale Glitters event. My friend and I were quickly greeted by the owner. He suggested we sit at the bar so we weren't seated next to a screaming baby- so that was nice & thoughtful. The prices were a little explosive for drinks but the atmosphere was great and so was the bartender."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I'm so excited places like this are opening up in downtown Glendale! I came for my birthday and I was not let down. The food is amazing and they have decent beer too. I'm excited to see the venue next door open! If you haven't tried this place, try it!"}
{"text":"In town for some golf and White Sox spring training staying at an AirBNB up the road from Cuff.  We were looking for a place to grab a couple of cocktails and relax so decided to give Cuff a shot.  Ended going back a second time we enjoyed it so much the first time.  Laid back atmosphere, great music playing, quiet enough to have a good conversation but not so quiet that everyone in the place can listen in.  Outstanding service both from the bar and the wait staff.    We tried several cocktails and was impressed with each.  My favorite was the blood orange margarita...delicious.  Food was really, really great bar food.  They obviously pride themselves on cooking a fairly simple menu especially well.  I appreciate that approach as a customer.  Highly recommend stopping in.  Only thing I didn't like were their hours being I wanted to stay longer and enjoy more tasty cocktails."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! Waiter was perfect; knowledgeable and there when needed, but not clingy. Food was really excellent; especially the brisket. Lots of delicious flavor. Solid homemade chocolate cake was a delicious ending."}
{"text":"The actual restaurant looks beautiful, nice bar area and the patio in the back is very nice as well. The waitstaff is very good the only issue we had was my husband and I both found hair on our food. Right on top in plain sight... We were in a hurry and decided to just pay for our meal and leave. We chalked it up to the restaurant being new and still working out the kinks. They had what appeared to be construction workers coming from the kitchen so maybe there was just a ton going on back there and the attention to detail was lost. I would however recommend the bar, looks like a nice place to get a drink especially during Glendale glitters!"}
{"text":"Wow! The cocktails are amazing here and the service is fast and friendly. Next time we will check out the off the cuff comedy venue, only $12 for entry. You need to try this hidden gem in the historic district of Glendale."}
{"text":"We were welcomed by friendly staff who seated us very quickly. We order the deviled eggs and it wasn't that bad, the bacon added a very nice touch. We ordered the Baja fish tacos which my partner stated was very good. I order the shrimp and grits which were very tasty and very filling. This is the perfect meal to get full off of. During the winter you get a beautiful view of Glendale glitters as well when it is going on. But we will be back in next time for happy hour. Happy"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was a bit tight, but the food was impressive. I've never tried Cajun style fries before. Cuff burger was amazing! Server was great and even moved us outside after we sat down because it's nice out."}
{"text":"I read the reviews so I should have known what to expect. But sometimes, sometimes on full moon, I disagree with the reviews. Tonight was not a full moon. The food was bland, i wasn't at all happy with it. The drinks sound good but they are so pricey I'm not even going to chance it and end up paying for a mediocre drink. I got the lemon chicken in broth with broccoli.   Let's just say, when I'm hungry and I come across this place.... I'll just keep walking."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place last week and headed back there tonight.  Food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Came down to see a friend's show in the showroom and had dinner.  I was blown away by it. They have terrific vegan options, such as the jackfruit fiesta salad, which was great. I had the pulled pork tacos and they were also fantastic--the pork had great smoky flavor. The cajon fries are a little spicy but very good.  Overall I feel like I found a gem.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We tried the Baja Tacos, Deviled Eggs, Calamari, and Brisket. Happy hour prices are good, wait staff, service, and bartender were great. I'd recommend the Tacos and deviled eggs for sure. I wouldn't do the brisket again but I'm picky. They had a nice IPA on draft and Stone in the bottle. Overall a nice place to visit in downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"First experience here, I had a drink and appetizer at the bar and then sat down with a large group for dinner.  I like the place itself - layout, decor, etc.  It is a bit cozy but expected for an older building in downtown Glendale.  There's a decent amount of items on the happy hour menu, best deal if you are going to eat there.  The staff was nice and attentive, however our experience with the food was not the best.  While at the bar, the gentleman next to me ordered calamari and the plate was cold and his calamari was cool/cold.  The bartender did return it to the kitchen and warm food came shortly.  I shrugged it off.  My wings were good but a bit spicy for being the only sauce option - my older parents, in their late 60s, would not be able to handle these.  The pasole was good, I enjoyed the interpretation and would get again.  The majority of our table ordered burgers and everyone had the same thoughts - cold buns, cold plates and some of the burgers themselves were cool.  I am not sure if the restaurant is not used to being busy or if the kitchen staff just wasn't on their game that night, but these seem like simple things were overlooked that patrons expect anywhere.  I will probably give Cuff another chance, but these items are things management needs to pay attention to and fix or people will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!! The service was fantastic and the huge Vegan menu is a major plus. The black bean burger is fantastic. Then I had their CUFF MAC which is sooooo good. One of the best home made Mac and Cheese dishes Ive had in a long time. I also had the Seasonal Salad with pecans and goat cheese. Really good. The restrooms are clean and the bar has top shelf liquor. I will be coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"The change in ownership has really killed this place. It used to be great, now the new guy running it is trying to hock his Asian fusion food here. There's a reason no one eats at Zhangs anymore (he killed that place too), so quit trying to ruin Cuff with the food from Zhangs. Also they really have got to get a chef back with some passion. Their menu that was seemingly supposed to be seasonal has become static and poorly executed. It is extremely unfortunate whats going on here."}
{"text":"Food, ambiance and hospitality were excellent. My wife and I \"Yelped\" our way here for lunch and it was a treat. The staff were very friendly and greeted us like they were sincerely glad we were there. We split an order of the Fish Tacos and a special hamburger and they were outstanding. Though we only get to the Phoenix area once per year we will definitely make it a point to enjoy a meal here on our next visit."}
{"text":"Tuesday was a chill night, the bar was better than I was expecting. They definitely make craft drinks and the passion fruit margarita was amazing! I will be back for sure. The food smelled really good, so next time I'll make sure to eat as well."}
{"text":"What a gem!!!!! The food , the food, the service, the atmosphere the whole experience ....Faaantastic!! We cannot wait to go back! Love this place . Bonnie and Heather"}
{"text":"Talk about some amazing food. The deviled eggs with little strips of bacon on top are delicious. Loving the traditional steak burger with some seasoned fries. The place looks nice, very clean and a few distinct features within the atmosphere that makes it look better. Staff are doing a great job at work providing excellent customer service. This a restaurant that downtown Glendale should be treasuring."}
{"text":"Who knew that Cuff also encompasses Zang's? Well... maybe a lot of people, but not me! The husband and I met another couple and their baby here for happy hour (mostly food, come on now). The happy hour has decent food specials, with many regular menu items 2-3$ off. I started with their version of a Moscow mule, which was ah mazing! So so good. They infuse Tito's with fig and add basil, serious legit drinkage. For food, I tried the deviled eggs... very tasty.... the burger - also super good topped with cheese and bacon, yum!, and the pulled pork sandwich - the only thing that was so so. The pulled pork was spicy, which I like, but didn't have much else in the way of flavor. I'd stick with the burger next time (or maybe some Chinese food, ha!). Their fries were also killer.... crunchy and seasoned perfectly. The service here was on point, we had to turn the waitress away from filling our waters. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and I had the shrimp and grits, my friend had the eggplant parmesan sandwich .. both were good.  Beer and wine list is limited, but has some good selections.  The wait staff and customer service needs improvement.  They weren't busy and it took forever (after motioning them several times) to order a round of drinks, food, and water (typically customary).  It took them 15 minutes (I actually timed it) to ask us if we wanted some more water or drinks (they were visibly empty and we tried to get their attention multiple times).  We closed our tab, paid, signed the check and several minutes later the bartender alerted me that they mis-ran the check and forgot to add one of the beers.  Now, I eat out a lot .. any decent restaurant would have just not said anything or would have not requested additional payment for a $5 beer after the customer closed a $50 tab.  They re-ran the check and made me re-pay/sign for it .. and then it got billed twice to me.  Normally I would have just tipped the bartender the different in amount (but she was too dull to process that concept).  Amusingly, our food was rung through a second time and came out again.  Also, a reasonable restaurant would have maybe offered to box it up for us as it was their mistake -- nope, they continued to act totally clueless and probably just threw it in the trash.  This place has a cool atmosphere and could be really good if they get their customer service act together.  The chef/owner was clueless and didn't even walk over and apologize -- rude."}
{"text":"FINALLY!  A great West side place!  We needed something of this caliber in downtown Glendale.  If you haven't tried it yet, you MUST!"}
{"text":"Sweet-and-sour pork was excellent. The pork was tender, not too much breading and the sauce wasn't too sweet. Also ordered a side order of eggroll. They were light on the breading, crisp,  and the filling was great. Unfortunately my wife ordered the special potato and ? tacos. She didn't enjoy them. She said they were very bland. The Caesar salad was average. We definitely would come back for the Chinese food."}
{"text":"Having lunch at this cocktail bar/grill.  Really cool spot. It has a bar & grill look, with a cocktail/diner feel.  The 8oz cuff burger with cajun fries - with a Left Hand nitro brew.  Both were good. The burger was more well done than than it was medium, how I ordered it, but no big deal.  Maybe next time they'll get it right.  But the mai tai stole the show. It's strong- and it comes with a flaming sugar cube that dissolves into the drink.   They also have a small garden in the back patio - where they pick their own herbs and use their own mint for their Mojitos.  Pretty dope."}
{"text":"Well we went Saturday night service a little slow I had grilled fish tacos friends had breaded fish tacos , small salad with grilled chicken nice portions  My only issue is I received my bill paid with cash the server rounded by change down by seven cents I know it a small issue my bill was $16.53 my change should have $3.47 he gave me $3.40 instead but he acted like that was perfectly ok well my feeling was you feel ok to give me less change I give you less tip"}
{"text":"The first time I went there I wasn't sure what to do, whether to wait to be seated or seat myself. Someone finally noticed I looked lost and said I could sit wherever. I had the eggplant parmesan and the mixed greens salad. SO DELICIOUS. I don't usually enjoy salads but this salad had a good, fresh mix of greens, goat cheese (yum), candied walnuts, and I think cranberries with a dash of peach vinaigrette. Eggplant parmesan was also delicious. I sat at the bar and ordered a drink, but none of the drink options looked too pleasant so I told the nice bartender to surprise me with something fruity. She came up with a concoction that she called \"the perfect storm.\" It was a blend of three different rums, pineapple, orange, and cranberry juice. I would definitely recommend. I also took my company there for round 2 for our Christmas dinner party and everyone absolutely loved it. We tried the butternut squash soup and it blew my mind! I would definitely recommend Cuff!"}
{"text":"Not your typical menu...ordered chicken stew and posole tonight...both delicious!  Service very good. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Cuff offers some interesting food in old town Glendale for a reasonable price. My wife ordered a burger that she pegged as the second (or third) best she's had in the valley. I had the brisket which had a nice little kick to it.  The meat and cheese plate felt a bit underwhelming. 1 cheese, a couple VERY thin slicers of a couple cured meats. Almonds. 3 pieces of bread. Mustard and some kind of preserve. We had to ask for the olives separately. That meat board is probably the main reason why I'm thinking 4 stars instead of 5.  Service was friendly but a tad slow. The bartender served us and he was friendly but when he had to tend bar, things got a bit slow. The restaurant is attempting to hire more staff so hopefully the speed will get better in time.  Restaurant has a nice decor and was clean. They have a full bar and the prices seemed reasonable. I would wish for a couple decent local brews on tap but I guess there are other options nearby for that.  Overall the West Valley could use more places like this and I'm looking forward to trying more food and hopefully they are able to get fully staffed in the future."}
{"text":"A gem of a restaurant!  A very small well run restaurant in the heart of Glendale. The menu is very small, but not limited.  Everything that came out of the kitchen was full of flavor and also visually appealing. I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy and it was done just right.  I could actually taste the fried shrimp which is something most places don't get right, even after multiple attempts.  - Parking was easy - extremely affordable  - good service - not commercial :-)"}
{"text":"Went here last night. We were excited about Glendale getting some good hip restaurants. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as the reviews have said. I had the cuff burger and it was fine, nothing special. But my husband got the shrimp and grits (which was also fine) but it didn't arrive until after my kids and I had already finished all our food. I understand when waitresses forget to put in an order or if the kitchen gets backed up but usually the staff would apologize for this type of hold up. The restaurant wasn't even busy. After my husband waited 15 minutes for his food after everyone else had finished theirs you think they would have come over and been apologetic and said \"I'm so sorry for the delay, dessert is on us\" or something to display proper customer service. We won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Cuff didn't disappoint on our first visit. It's nice to have a local restaurant that isn't a chain. We went for dinner last night and enjoyed the ambience and the food. We ordered the flatbread for an appetizer and it was pretty good.  There were five of us and we each shared different sandwiches including the pork shoulder and fried shrimp po boy. Everyone was happy with their food. Being a new restaurant, I think they have a few things to work out but overall we were impressed. Our server was pleasant and fun and the chef came over and asked us how the food and experience was which is a big bonus in my book. Team Cuff!"}
{"text":"Melissa was great and the Barruta was delish! They are combining two restaurants now while one is being remodeled. I got some Asian soup while I was at it. Hot and Sour soup on a cold, gray day.   I would go back to Cuff. Happy hour seems great too. The menus is limited though and it is a bit spendy. It is a darling little place and one of the few in DT Glendale that is actually open around 3 or 4 o'clock."}
{"text":"Love this place food is fabulous service is amazing there is always something new and exciting on the menu Cuff is a winner you won't be disappointed"}
