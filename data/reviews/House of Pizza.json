{"text":"New York House of Pizza is the best in the west! The employees are especially kind and helpful. We've been eating here for a year and a half and won't go anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"HORRENDOUS customer service. LOUD, grating environment with endless shouting. 

This 1-star review is because of the attitude and the mouth on the main cashier, clearly a New Yorker in his 40's. When we ordered our food he was not very friendly, which is the \"authentic attitude\", I suppose, but as my dine-in experience progressed, his volume and language became increasingly outrageous. 

Three times he apologized on the phone for mistaking orders; he referred to another unhappy customer as \"a bitch with the tiramisu\". 

Twice they made my girlfriend the wrong pizza. TWICE! Then, when she asked for the garlic knots we ordered, he mumbled under his breath \"I'll kill you\". EXCUSE ME??? You'll kill your customer for asking for the food we ordered!?!? 20 seconds later, our garlic knots arrived, still hot, indicating that they were sitting in the kitchen and possibly not served to us on purpose.

I will not be patronizing a restaurant with this level of abuse in customer service. \"Authentic New York-style\" or not, there is NO EXCUSE for any of this cursing and venom.

The pizza was ok, garlic knots were good, but I'd advise that you order online if you must have this pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service, great prices! Quick service, convenient to North Summerlin,  Desert Shores, etc...."}
{"text":"If Yelp wasn't so hung up on integers, I'd give this place 3 and a half stars.  It was a HOT July evening in the Queen City and so the wife and I decided to cool off by going to a Greek pizza joint and getting HOT food.  Choo godda poblem widdat??   As others have said, the meatball sub and the steak sub seemed to be the signature items.  Meatball sub was a bit salty and it was overflowing with meat and cheese.  At first all I could see was cheese but then the cheese seemed to vanish in front of me and I actually wanted more cheese (must have been the heat, it was a HOT day).  Went through two soda pops because it's HOT in Charlotte in July. Wife really liked the steak sub.  All in all, it was a satisfying meal.  Good people watching too.  We were in and out in 30 minutes and for under $20.  And when we got outside it was still very HOT.  We really enjoyed the HOT of PIZZA and all the HOT food they serve.  Oh my freakin' lord, it is so very HOT in Charlotte in July."}
{"text":"My husband's & I favorite place for pizza!!!!
Will not eat pizza from anywhere else anymore!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on Long Island, went to college in Manhattn and spent the last 10 years in Brooklyn.  Been in Vegas a year. I was DESPERATE for NY pizza and so happy to find the real thing. Nothing else like it in the valley. I'll even forgive them for being Yankees fans"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!   Finally!   Authentic NY Pie.   Drove from Green Valley to check it out.  Wish they delivered.  I'll be back.  No doubt!!!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down to this place. With great anticipation we ordered a cheese. & sausage pizza to take out. When we got home it was cheese & pepperoni. The sauce was bitter and just because the place has New York in it`s name, doesn't mean it is good. Sweeten the sauce and listen to what the customer orders."}
{"text":"I went to house of pizza it was great the pizza is phenomenal staff there is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great pizza, thin ny style. Cozy neighborhood pizza joint. Awesome service, great food. Also offer a military discount, will definitely be returning to this gem!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I was served food so hot I had to wait for it to cool. That's not the worst way to start.  I dropped by one Sunday for an early dinner.  Decor: dated and unimpressive.  Service marginally friendly but effiecient.  I don't need to bond, just eat.  Had the canelloni, was piping hot and saucy.  Thank goodness for the generous portion of garlic bread.  Is it freshly made pasta in an heirloom recipe sauce? No.  But it is hot and tasty and fairly priced. I will certainly be going back, at least for take out."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Charlotte! Subs are out of this world delicious as well! Best ingredients. Homemade salad dressings! Quality."}
{"text":"Not sure why ppl like this place so much. The minute my wife and I walked in we were stared at like we just cussed out the whole restaurant. Keep in mind this was our first time there. The waitress was young and hated her job. I ordered eggplant parm. The wife had a small veggie pizza. Both if us got salads. This was quite possibly the most underwhelming meal I have ever had. The price was overwhelming. Over 36.00 is what they wanted for 10.00 worth of food. As George Bush said \"fool me once shame on you, you'll never fool me again.\""}
{"text":"awesome food awesome people!!!!! loved the great customer service, greeted me as soon as I came in. good didn't take long. tasted great!!! recommend to all."}
{"text":"New York style pizza from a place that gets to know their customers. Hard to find that NY Pizza \"flavor\" in Vegas but I found it! Linguine and clams is the best too...! Friendly staff, looks like it's family owned and has that NY pizza place feel to it. Just give it a try and you decide... :-) This Jersey Gyrl gives her seal of approval."}
{"text":"Love the Pizza, salads and subs not to mention the great smells inside. Personally I do not care for the pasta dishes because the sauce is a little  heavy for my taste. Overall I really like this place and the service has always been great. It is a nice place to chill and chat with friends or family."}
{"text":"I have been coming here sense I was a child. They have the best cheese steak sub in all of Charlotte. When someone asks me where can I get a good cheese steak without hesitation I tell them House of Pizza.  Pizza is very good as well.  I just can't get myself to order anything but the cheese steak.  I always have them add a little pizza sause to mine, just a suggestion.  You'll be glad you went there."}
{"text":"Being from New Jersey and a huge Yankees fan this place is soo good. Felt like I was back on the west coast. Good prices and even better pizza! I'll  definitely be back, glad i found this gem. ;) A good environment and the Yankee memorabilia is so bomb."}
{"text":"I love the plain cheese pizza!!! Just like in NY City. Great deals too. Friendly staff. Love the Yankees memorabilia. So far the best for me."}
{"text":"Sad to say they had great pizza at the beginning .. Now cutting corners ... Very pricey not worth the money.. We will not be ordering there anymore. It's a shame because we didn't mind the high price for good pizza. But dominos pizza is close and way better and cheaper !!!"}
{"text":"How are people saying this is the best pizza in Charlotte??? This restaurant is vastly overrated. I ordered a Hawaiian pizza, ad it came out with unbrowned chewy mozzarella, tasteless sauce, and forgettable crust. Not to mention the cook didn't core the pineapple. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the service wasn't bad. The pizza however... You might as well go to a cafeteria"}
{"text":"The subs are good but the pizza is terrible. We had a medium pie. It is mostly cheese and they are very light on the sauce.The sauce has NO flavor at all. They have to do better than that. I would take a bite and have to double check to see if there was sauce on it because you  can't taste it! I would recommend their subs and salads."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor.....go elsewhere !!!
Never got our order, when I called dude named Mike, he said his driver was at my door for 45 min to an hour! 
Why he would stay at my door for that long is shocking .
 We've had a pie here before a couple of times, we've always had to re-heat, this time we mentioned it, but no luck, this time they never showed up, then lied about it.
Never again ! Half star at best !"}
{"text":"No restrooms n wont even let u wash ur hands!! Really!! Ordered 2 slices and it was very dry n very little sauce.. There was no flavor.. First and last time im going there!!"}
{"text":"I have mostly had good experiences here. The pizza dough is fresh, wings are great, and baklava is delicious! It doesn't look like much from the outside but it's definitely a good place to try."}
{"text":"Ok. I changed my mind about this place. I orderdd tonight. 1 large roni, chicken parm sub w a side of sauce and a bag of zeppolis. This place is so foul now, they should do theirselves a favor and stick to the dent wizard business which their car is always parked in the cleaners spot. 
The pizza is not NY style, their service sux like A-rod, and they dont even have a bathroom. 
Their pizza took about 40 mins to make. It is legitimately cardboard. They should change their name is cardboard house of pizza. It was 15 dollars. The chicken parm sub was ok but no side of sauce. The 6 dollar bag of zeppolis had about 10 little zeppolis. I called them and asked how many were supposed to come in the order. She said 6-7. I got ten so i guess i scored. For 6 bux, what a joke. They taste like puke. Their pizza cant stay hot bc it is so thin. 
I called and the girl said, sir i dont make the prices, im just the register girl. Now i know why she is just the register girl. My wife picked up the pizza w our 3 year old who had to use to the restroom bc it took so long. She asked if they had a bathroom, they said no and referred her to the chinese food place next door. I find it hard to believe they dont have a working restroom. Overall, this place is a pathetic excuse for a new york pizza place. We already didnt like going bc the guy would try to upsell u 17x when all u want is a slice. It took them about 2 years to open and now i know why, they have no idea what they r doing. Just go to the freezer section of 7-11 and buy a better pie. This place is gross"}
{"text":"Works pizza was disgusting.worst delivery pizza I ever had, no joke. Digiorno's would have destroyed this pizza.  Hell, a hot pocket would have been better."}
{"text":"First thing about house of pizza is that the atmosphere is wonderful. The dim lights and the old decor shows that this place is a place of character.  

Second is the food. It isn't fine dining or a hipster modern menu, but an old school Italian restaurant classic to the style of the     
Southern States. The spaghetti is great, the lasagna is delicious, the pizza ironically is so so. ( not bad at all, but not awesome) 

Third is that this is a local restaurant, and not a Chain. I felt noticed and cared for here. I felt more treated like a person and not just another customer.

I will be back sooner than later. Especially because their spaghetti lunch deal seems very good."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza spots in Vegas and reasonably priced and friendly, all I could ask for!"}
{"text":"Omg! Went there and for eggplant parmigiana and veal parmigiana and they were very good! Loved the dinner salad with the house dressing and garlic bread.  The prices are great for the amount of food you get, plenty to take home. Can't wait to try pizza and subs next time! First time won't be the last!"}
{"text":"..what can I say but.. Awesome! Had the chicken Parmesan sandwich, probably the best the best I'll ever have, and the homemade Cannolis... I don't eat a lot of sweets, but wow.. just wow! you gotta try em."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Ordered eggplant Parmesan and it was not breaded and fried.. Yucky boiled pieces of eggplant scraps with sum noodles and sauce dumbed on top. And bread knots soaking in it. The pizza was not thin crust as described and was dry. Awful place ."}
{"text":"Great New York style pizza and great customer service what more do you need? The food is always ready fast!! The owner is from New York and always goes out of his way to to make u feel at home.. Everytime I have ordered in or take out food was delicious.  I love this place, reminds me of home...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I ordered Pizza from the House of Pizza on Thursday night at 8:45 pm, the guy that answered the phone said, we close in 15 minutes you would have to come pick it up.  I think he heard me sigh, then asked where do you live, and I said Red Rock Country Club.  He then asked what I wanted and 30 minutes later two delicious pizza's showed up.  The Pie's were amazing, they were hot and the service I experienced from this place top notch.  I will be back and thanks for hooking up my hungry family that night.  The actual owner of the pizza place delivered it and I cannot say thank you enough.  For all the pizza lovers out there this place ranks at the top as far as i am concerned."}
{"text":"In my opinion, they have the best pizza I've eaten since I left Pa. in 1985.  Their subs are good,too, but their pizza is the best."}
{"text":"I've never been to New York so I can't really say that this is an authentic pizza place BUT...this place sure does look like a good place. The pizza tastes great!

I actually ordered a Baked Ziti but since they had to make fresh sauce they gave me a free slice of pepperoni pizza. The Baked Ziti tastes great! One of the best I had so far. 

The place is small and only room enough for about 8 people but it's clean and the workers are friendly."}
{"text":"We stopped by to grab a slice and a coke and the pizza was so delicious and authentic that we had to buy a large half pepperoni and half hawaiian and it was the best we ever had! It was not a $7.99 special you can get anywhere else.  Service was just as great as the pizza and the price was right!"}
{"text":"Visiting family in las vegas i stopped in this fine establishment ,were i order the bbq chicken pizza, i was impressed best pizza ive had in years i will be coming back here regulary!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Needs a renovation on the building though, which I believe is in the works for the summer months. We drive 30 miles to eat here. Best Philly Steak around! It is huge and delicious. They use good quality ingredients. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great little spot with very simple and delicious food.  The Greek sandwich is a must try, simply for the fantastic flavor of bleu cheese & italian dressing on a sandwich.  I also tried the lasagna and thought it was almost as good as mine...almost.  Cheap beers (if you've read my reviews, you know this is VERY important) and super fast and friendly service round this place out."}
{"text":"Great salads
Great steak & cheese
Good pizza

Two things to fix:
-Bathrooms are in miserable unsanitary shape.

-take out that juke box \" it's outdated \" customers has to pay to music??
Otherwise you can just have silence or listen to other people's conversations ?"}
{"text":"Just gross. Even with the revamp, the pizza is still gross, the food takes forever to come out and my stomach is in KNOTS. My son feels horrible too. Do not waste your money."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Extremely cheesy. Philly is pretty good too but not as good as portofinos philly. We usually get pizza from house of pizza and philly from portofinos."}
{"text":"Easy online ordering. We ordered the Sicilian pie for our office. The delivery was fast and prompt. The delivery person very sweet young lady.
The pizza was delicious. The crust perfectly cooked. The sauce was what sold me.
It was a little tangy and a little sweet.  
Lots of melted cheese. 
We will order again, we are looking forward to trying more of their menu items."}
{"text":"I have been going to the House of Pizza for over 15 years! Each bite of each steak and cheese sub gets better and better as the days go by. I live in another state now but when I visit Charlotte this is one of my must stops and I am never ever disappointed! Thank you, House of Pizza for being an amazing constant source of great good and fond memories!"}
{"text":"My man Magic knows how to make a pizza... I am crazy about the Hawain Pizza, never tasted a pizza like this before. Really good quality ham and pineapple! Delicious"}
{"text":"Called to place an order for delivery. Ordered LG thin crust Pepperoni /blk olive easy on the cheese. Husband really liked it and he's a picky philly italian, especially when it comes to pizza crust...he was very pleased! 
   Now to the other order...ordered a chicken parm and  broccoli rabe sandwich. Which looked incredible! For those of you familiar w/broccoli rabe know it DOESN'T LOOK OR TASTE ANYTHING LIKE BROCCOLI. I can't think of a single good reason why they would put broccoli NOT broccoli rabe on my chicken parm sandwich. I sure hope they weren't trying to sneak one over on me.
Most likely I'll give them the benifit of the doubt and probably try them again though. The chicken was fried nicely w/a tasty pepper and oil wetness to it, also , it was a very big sandwich!"}
{"text":"wwoohaaa... I am honestly picky when it comes to pizza, this place deserves 5 stars from me. I love places kike this when it comes to pizza..cozy, not expensive and family owned where you feel welcomed. This is a must place for me now even if I have to drive longer distance"}
{"text":"What New York trash can did they pull this pizza from? This place is legit garbage. We got the Grandma's pie. This is thick, dry stale crust with absolutely no sauce and a couple of gross mozzarella slices. This is the worst pizza that I've had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the \"old school look, feel, and juke box.\" I've been going here for about 25 years. It began with my grandparents after church on Sundays for lunch. Now that I've moved further away I still make time for a chicken parm sub when I'm in the area. Huge portions of spaghetti that can feed 2 or you can eat on it later."}
{"text":"Pizza is always fresh hot and ready to go when I get there, wings are always good too seem to use the pizza and wing special the most good deal"}
{"text":"My son and his girlfriend ordered a pie from here, not expecting much (considering it was only $8.99 for a large pie) and boy were we all surprised. It was delicious. Thin New York Style pizza that tasted very fresh! This will be my new Pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Pizzas are great, the staff is great, prices are great, it's clean and very fast. Seems like everybody that works here is FROM New York, and the pizzas really have that authenticity to them.

I'd like to make a longer review, but there's not much more to say. 5 stars across the board. I stop by for a slice every time I'm close by."}
{"text":"Love this place from the Authenticity of the food, the staff and down to the music. De-Lish"}
{"text":"Been YEARS since I ate at House of Pizza until they reopened after the remodel. Our party had a pizza, bacon sub and lasagna. (Keep in mind they have been packed since reopening and our wait was long).  I give the bacon sub a 5 Star all the way. Bread was good and tasty. Cheese was ample. Bacon was good and done (not limp) but not too crispy. Had good flavor. Loved shredded lettuce on it. All in all a great sub. The lasagna was thick, with lots of noodles, not overly sauced, might could have used a touch more shredded cheese. It had a good flavor - not the beat I have had, but better than many. The pizza - well here ya go. Crust was flavorful, done just right and no grease seepage from the sauce or toppings (I like that). We asked for lite on the sauce and they were spot on. Plenty of cheese. We ordered pepperoni, sausage and black olives. Plenty of black olives. I'm not convinced I care for the sliced sausage. Pepperoni was flavorful and good. 
As with all restaurants, there will be good and bad. We enjoyed it enough we will be returning soon."}
{"text":"So I called in an order tonight and got a confirmation for 20 minutes later. Arrived on time, and they had no record of my order. I showed them where I had called and they said I would have to wait again because they had no record of the order. Not even an apology. Other people's food looked good - too bad they didn't want to serve me."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza.  Great crust.  We got free garlic knots when we ordered a  large pizza and now I'll get free dessert  for reviewing them on Yelp!!"}
{"text":"Sunday- wed, they have a special for 8.99 large cheese pizza. t is pick up only. It is right next to Walgreens and decided to give it a try. It was very good. Will be going backj"}
{"text":"Today I ordered a lg meat lovers pizza, which was just the right amount of greasiness and Stromboli was very good. The Stromboli was full of flavor. I also had a Cannoli and it was awesome. Crunchy and the filling was not too sweet...it complimented the shell. It's a must have with coffee. I would eat there again"}
{"text":"House of Pizza is just like your favorite pizza, pasta, and sub joint from childhood, right down to the gaudy, dated decor.  I had not  yet found a really good pizza parlor in Charlotte in four years of living here, but I think I just did yesterday.  I like big portions, extra cheese, and images of the Parthenon and old school Jesus at my pizza parlor, so I'm giving my excursion to H.O.P. 4.5 stars!

The restaurant occupies a weathered building on Central and Eastway-where restaurants can be real hits or real misses.   I was a little worried about the quality when I scoped out the interior.  But I was quickly seated and my order was taken a minute or two later-a house salad with ranch dressing and a personal pan pizza with Italian sausage.  Check 1 for good service.  They didn't skimp on the dressing like more frou frou restaurants and the lettuce was still crisp; check 2. Then they brough out my pan pizza-hot, covered in a quarter inch of gooey mozzarella, homemade sauce, and real Italian sausage (not that freeze dried matter you get at Domino's).  Mamma mia, I'm marrying an Italian girl one day!!!  My waitress made sure my Diet Pepsi was refilled and my food was satisfactory.  My bill came up to $13, so I walked away fat and happy. Check 3, 4, 5, and 6!!!

 Based on other Yelpers, the subs are equally good.  I guess I'll be flipping a coin on my next visit.  If you miss the days before pizza became a culinary craft, you'll fall in love with this vintage pizza joint.  I know that its going on my \"circuit\" of comfort food joints."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y.  Lived in New Jersey for 43 years before retiring to Las Vegas in 2004. I had been looking for a good New York style Pizza, at last after 10 years it finally arrived in Sun City Summerlin - House of Pizza.

I visit them at least once a week to savor their Pizza by the slice. The lentil soup is as good as my Grandma made.

Thank  you \"House of Pizza\""}
{"text":"Not NY pizza at all. But taste good for vegas pizza so itll get 2 stars. Very disappointed in my expectations being from NYC and not getting what the company claimed to be ny pizza"}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying this is my first time ordering from this place and I plan to try it one more time with the possibility of updating my review to give it a fair shot. I did order through Eat 24 for delivery so I'm not sure if there was some communication error but my
Pizza was supposed to be half pepperoni and half cheese. It was all pepperoni.  It was also supposed to be light sauce and it wasn't. Then I ordered a large house salad and it looked fresh but I hated the greens. The ranch also tasted like store bought when I kind of expected house made."}
{"text":"Great New York style slices, like the kind you'd expect at any corner pizzeria in Manhattan, except a bit less greasy.

Ordered pickup from here, service was prompt and friendly.

Have tried so far:
1/ Large Pizza 
 Half pepperoni, and half Hawaiian (ham and pineapple). Delicious and savory.
2/ Fettuccine Alfredo
Decently proportioned, pasta prepared al dente, good flavor.
3/ Garlic Knots
A little dull, slightly overcooked, and not greasy enough!
4/ Custard
Both individual and large buckets from CJ's! Delicious."}
{"text":"Great Place    Love the Joint!!! Best Pizza in town BY FAR!!! Great service and amazing food Can't get any better! They made me feel right at home!!! This is the only place I get pizza at in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"When I want local pizza like home in NJ I come here. The house salad dressing and cannoli are awesome too. The crust on the pizza is just right."}
{"text":"It is rare that I order delivery, but running low on options- I tried the location on lake mead blvd. it was a mistake to say the least.
1. The online ordering service is poorly designed and makes ordering a pepperoni pizza extremely difficult. You are stuck making special adjustments to the items hoping they come out right. The descriptions are lacking.
2. I waited 90 minutes after ordering before calling the location to inquire about the wait. The employee was unapologetic. I tipped 5 in advance and can't get that back.
3. By the time it finally arrives Im about 3/4 through a bag of chips I got from the gas station during my wait and moment of desperation. The pizza I received was a disappointment. The white pizza promised fresh basil and mozzarella and did not deliver. The ricotta was an unusual texture. My other pizza had unwanted toppings, which ironically just slide off the crust to where they belong.. The garbage.
4. Ultimately the most important factor is the crust. There is an expectation that comes with New York style, and this crust was a cookie cutter press out on a wire screen. The evidence is on the bottom- an imprint of the lazy pizza makers short cut. Leaving me with a chewy cracker instead of a pizza crust. For the price the service was unreasonable and I would definitely appreciate a refund."}
{"text":"2.5/5. Everything is just ok. I've heard great things and nothing has impressed me.  Pizza crust is plain and dull with no crisp or unique anything. Cheap cheese and no seasoning on the pizza or sauce. 

On the second visit...tried the meat sauce, again it was bland and reminded me of cafeteria food.  The fried mozzarella is frozen from a box. 

Better pasta can be found at your local h.t."}
{"text":"Awesome service, good variety, great prices, and the food is the bomb. Their driver quit on em and i ordered just before they closed so i had to go pick up my pizzas but who cares this pizza is delicious (gluten free cheese and pepperoni). and the custard which is made by hand like any good custard should be is just as delicious. Found another jewel in the desert. I was also informed that they have some dang good pasta sauce which i will have to try next time."}
{"text":"HOUSE OF PIZZA REOPENED TODAY AT 5PM. Back in business. The long wait through the cold winter...and last fall ..... and this past spring..... are over. I even called to make sure. I could smell cheesesteak sub through the phone. THEY'RE BAAAACCKK!!"}
{"text":"This is the pizza you crave when you crave pizza! Definitely recommend if you like New York style."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing and the owner Mike is very hospitable!! Oh and you must try the delicious desserts!!!"}
{"text":"Last time I went to House of Pizza was 10+ years ago, but my wife wanted to give it another try.  

Very popular place with people waiting at the door and the wait staff was fast & courteous.  My wife got pizza and I got chicken fettuccine alfredo where neither of us were impressed.  It was OK, but nothing exceptional.  You can get way better pizza & pasta going to Portofino's in the shopping center right behind House of Pizza in the same price range, but you always have to keep personal taste in mind.

A friend's wife only like Portofino's and loves House of Pizza going there regularly since she was a teen where House of Pizza has a huge  nostalgia factor for many patrons."}
{"text":"Love that this place is so close to my friends house so I can always just stop by and pick up a pizza. Prices are great and pizza is good. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"3.5* rounded up: 

I've only had the Grandma Pies here and enjoyed them, so did my family. The NY memorabilia made me feel right at home, so did the guys working the counter. 

I've never eaten in the pizzeria, but there are a few tables and it is tidy. Was particularly nice of them to apply a \"free pie\" mailer my folks had received toward our first Grandma Pie and let me pay the difference. 

They have a Sunday-Wednesday $8.99 pick-up special, a two slice + drink $5 lunch special, offer the usual pizzeria dishes, slices, some desserts, and they deliver. Will definitely try a regular pie and maybe a white slice next time.

* good Grandma Pie (which so few places in Las Vegas offer :( *

** Pick-up lunch & dinner specials **

*** they deliver ***"}
{"text":"I was 100% skeptical of this place. I live right around the corner and have passed it many times. I finally decided to give it a try one night when I was looking for a certain type of pizza, totally greasy and bad for you. Well this place hit the spot of exactly what I was looking for. 
I went in to place my order since it was the first time I had ordered from them and honestly the inside did not impress me, in fact it made me a little worried even. With that said I don't know that I would take the time to go in and eat but I will probably be ordering to go from here a lot in the future. 
I ordered a large pizza with pineapple, half with jalapeno and the other half with black olives and it hit the spot. I think next time I will get light on the sauce as I am not a huge fan of sauce but it was exactly what I was looking for. I also ordered the mozzarella sticks which were just frozen and fried, don't know that I will get those again but the pizza I will for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered the HUGE 28 inch pizza with pepperoni and sausage! First let me say ordering was easy and the girl I spoke with was super friendly and helpful. When I got there they were very busy but I was welcomed and only waited a few minutes. After I paid she came out with this ginormous pizza!! I was floored by the size of this thing! She opened it so I could see and check it out then offered to carry it to the car for me. She made a bag of red pepper and parm cheese and followed me to my car where we had to put the pizza in the trunk because of its size! When I got home my kids were so excited to see such a huge pizza! This was the best pizza I have had since living in northeast PA! Great quality meats and cheese and a very tasty sauce! Crust was perfect! Amazingly good! My whole family loves it and my 10 year old son declared this our new pizza place always! Lol. 
Great service and great pizza!!!!!! We will definitely order from here again! Yummo!"}
{"text":"I've never thrown away a whole pizza before. Especially an expensive one. Got the Grandmas pie. Stale thick bread, sour sauce, 5 strings of basil, rubbery pieces of not fresh cheese. Yuck to the max. This is a Signature pie. I can't imagine the regulars. Stay far far away Yelpers! For your own sake"}
{"text":"First time I came here I was dismayed by the pizza being served. I don't want to go into the details of what I felt the pizza lacked (cheese, oil, marinara, tomatoes, etc.) But I came back and the small, unique hole in the wall responded with almost good pizza. That is a step in the right durection. They even have their own sauce for sale as well and I think next time I go I will by a jar. From dismay to delight. Well transformed. Keep it up and the five stars will be yours to claim."}
{"text":"Definitely not New York pizza but it does have the cool New York look made me feel like back home"}
{"text":"This. Place. Though. Do yourself a favor and go to. This. Place. :)

Seriously the best cheesesteaks, salad dressings, and lasagna in town. All 3 are bar none better than any where else in the whole dang city!!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. It was like a stringy board of gum on our pizza. And we like ALL pizza ..... but not theirs. It was bad."}
{"text":"I have to say this place has blown my mind every time I have ordered from here. Their pizza is AMAZING, their wings AMAZING, and their prices are AMAZING. I wish I lived close so they could deliver, but I will be moving near by soon and this will be my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"The best pizza and meatballs my husband and I have ever had! The staff is friendly and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"In a bizarre turn of events, not one of the 6 people at our table ordered pizza in this supposed House of Pizza. Apparently our friends who brought us here have never even tried their pizza and they used to frequently order from this place when they lived nearby. i for one was very satisfied with my decision. i ordered the lasagna which comes with a salad and garlic bread. The salad is bare bones with lettuce, peppers, a tomato, onions and dressing. The lasagna was delightful. There was no burnt edges, just perfectly cooked as promised. Rather than just a slice of garlic bread, it is really more like a small loaf of garlic bread. It was perfect for making little lasagna sandwich bites with the garlic bread that i so thoroughly enjoy doing. Why don't Italian places offer a lasagna sandwich? or do they?

As far as draft beer choices: Budweiser....and Budweiser.  That's it. Figured what the hell, haven't done the Bud Heavy in years. For $2.25, it came in an overly frozen/frosted little mug. It worked."}
{"text":"So first of all if I could give a zero rating I would. We tried them a second time and again the order was terrible. The wings were disgusting!!! The pizza order was an absolute disaster. Never, never, never again will we order from this place. We order at least twice a week from Sabatino's, Angelina's, Red Rock and the favorite of all Rocco's!!! When I called to let them know Johnny (who took the original order) answered again. I told him to forget sending another pizza, we just wanted a refund and wanted to speak to a manager.
Guess who was the manager?? Johnny was it!! To my amazement I let him know that we would not be ordering from there again and that I would be Yelping, as that's what Yelpers do.
He did offer to send the correct order, but unfortunately after trying the wings we did receive, we said \"no way\". The wings were not edible. 
He did give us a full refund, and he also apologized for the error. However, when you make an order to go, you expect to get what you ordered. As a manager you should be checking every single order going out to ensure it is correct. 
I just can't allow spending \"hard worked money\" and not getting what I asked for. And not even close to what I asked for. I ordered a thin crust and received a thick crust. Are you serious?
Everyone makes mistakes, we are human. However, when you are in a business of supplying food there needs to be standards.  
We are extremely patient, and good tipping people as we know that sometimes that is where you get you're livelihood. I mean this is Vegas!
We understand mistakes but, this one was unacceptable. Sorry, not a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I looked online today and they are indeed reopened! Now I can indulge my favorites like the cheesesteak, lasagna and pizza. They were closed for so long I was starting to wonder if they would ever open again. There are huge improvements. The parking lot is not full of holes anymore, the dining room is much larger and there is actually a separate section for carry out orders. I'm so thrilled!"}
{"text":"This restaurant as I always saw it was a gem in Charlotte. Not much people know about it, but does it attract people from all around. One time I saw a Huntersville Police come down to this restaurant. I don't blame them taking that trip to taste their delicious subs.

I'm not a big fan of their pizza, but I will eat their subs daily if I could. I always order the Mushroom Steak or their Combination Steak subs which come with a melted cheese sub with mushrooms and steak with peppers (combination steak) and chips. I wish I could substitute the chips with something like a salad or something, but I'm not going to complain. The salad here is the freshest in all the restaurants I have ever eaten at. The house salad is always crisp and just taste wonderful with the  green peppers and baby tomatoes they add.

Every bite of their sub was an experience for me. The service is nice, but when it gets hectic in the restaurant you have to give them a little break. Inside, they have dimmed lights also with a big old style radio player (that plays really old music every 15-30 min). Overall, I love this place. It's not too far from my house and it's absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Always love this place... It's a great place for pasta, pizza and sandwiches. Make sure to go and enjoy"}
{"text":"Really, really good pizza. I'm not a big fan of pizza but this place makes it so good I had it 2 times this week. It's super fresh and delicious, don't get me started on their wings, let me just say order more than you need because they are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Where do I get started?!.... wow.... the worst pizza I have ever had in my life, worse than little caesars!!!! it tasted like a sweet tomato paste as the sauce, I won't even mention how bad the dough was. They use a conveyer belt pizza oven while claiming to be east coast style pizza? Do yourself a favor and go to Cuginos or Verrazanos!"}
{"text":"I would give it 2.5 stars but unable to  due to the star system.  Ordered two  large pizzas for delivery: One cheese pizza was ok. Sauce is decent, lacks a little flavor like garlic or oregano . I would even settle for basil, even a little salt.  The other pizza was half pepperoni with exactly 7 total pieces of pepperoni spread on four slices of pizza. This was not large pepperoni, but your normal size, what a rip off. Until you saw the other half sausage and roasted red pepper.  First off the sausage was little drops, and if I counted four altogether it may be over stating it.  Then then someone took four long thin strips of roasted pepper and spread it over the four pieces that you really had to look for it. Trust me when my parents looked at it they said did you get half cheese and whats with that pepperoni.  Overall taste of crust is good and place has potential. No, not like NY, I am from NY and was actually craving NY pizza and decided to try this place. I just wanted after a very busy work week a good sausage and pepper pizza, I will keep looking......"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza and pastas & great customer service what more do you need? On top of that the food is always ready super fast!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Some say the pizza is too cheesy, not crispy enough, but I think it's great. I always get a medium pepperoni pizza and the pizza is huge so there are always leftovers! Cheesy garlic bread is awesome, it's basic garlic bread with mozzarella on top....but it's delicious. My boyfriend really likes the Hawaiian Pizza and gyros. It's a family owned place, been around for years, since I was a child."}
{"text":"Good food. Filling. The owners/or ladies that run it can be a little rude and disrespectful at times. Otherwise, the pizza is good as are the subs."}
{"text":"If you like \"old school\" pizza and sub joints (not decorated by some MBA, pastel vinyl freak), this is your place. It sits on Central Ave, just over the Eastway intersection (heading towards town), on the left. The neighborhood demographic is changing, so it's become a little out of place (yes, that's an OOB Waffle House next door and a Hispanic Western Wear a couple doors down).

I have an indecent love for their cheese steaks and Greek subs. I alternate between the two most of the time. I've had their pasta (great) and their pizza (also great), but the subs are what I keep coming back for.

Being a true \"Child of the South\", I won't try to compare the cheese steaks to anything from where you used to live up North. All I know is I like them as well as any I've found in CLT. Loads of meat (with just the right amount of what I like to pretend is just \"juice\"), onions, and cheese. The meat has a hint of (Greek?) seasoning which I suspect gets put into everything in the place. Served with rippled chips and a pickle spear.

The Greek sub is another thing altogether. Roast beef and other cold-cuts on a hoagie bun, oozing with some mysterious sauce which is apparently the result of an evil lab experiment directed at completely dominating my waistline.

I alternate between the two, and there is always a mental tug of war over the choice.

There have been a lot of cigarettes smoked, beers drank, and pizzas sliced in this place over the years. Decor is pretty much unchanged from when your parents went on dates here. They have a jukebox and daily specials.

In my bachelor days, \"House of Pizza\" was one of my regular haunts. Since getting married and moving to the other side of town, I don't get in there as often as I should.

NOT A CHAIN, LOCALLY OWNED, GOOD FOOD. If you need a more corporate experience, there's an Olive Garden on Independence. Shame on you if you miss this place, though."}
{"text":"Hands down this place has the best vegetable lasagna and eggplant parmesan. The prices are cheap and the food is plentiful. When I need a carb hangover this is where I go."}
{"text":"Wish I lived closer. I'd be ordering here all the time. Had the Grandma pie and let's talk about the cheesecake! Delicious!"}
{"text":"The pizza had sooooooo much cheese, it was way toooo much.(that we were putting it aside when it slide off the pizza not needing it back on the pizza!!)   The service was okay. I do not like the primitive way they write out tickets you can't read them and it feels like the owner just rings up whatever!!  Not to mention how uncomfortable I was the out dated and sardine can feeling bathrooms!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had!! Got the family special which came with a lot of food. They also have the gluten free option for pizza!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by Mike, the owner of the business, and he apologized and totally took charge of the matter. Not only did he handle it directly and take full responsibility, he offered a dinner on him for the inconvenience. That's what a true business owner looks like. 
On to the food. I must say this order was 1000 times better. It only took 30 from order to delivery. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak, chicken parmigiana sandwich, eggplant roll, and chicken wings. Everything was awesome! 
I understand everyone has a bad day. But it's how you handle it that makes the difference. And Mike definitely made the difference. As long as this place is consistent, then they will have my business."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, the first time we tried this place I was disappointed. The cheese was burnt and the crust was too soggy. 

We recently decided to give this place another shot. They were brand new anyway and figuring things out. Wow, thank goodness we did. 

This is the best pizza in las Vegas. The crust was thing, the cheese was perfect, and the toppings were fresh. 

We also really liked the staff and the pizza was ready pretty quickly. 

This is the only place we'll be ordering from. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB! Awesome service, and the pie was amazing! The lady at the register was super helpful! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place and I was glad I did. If I could rate it 3.5 stars, I would. The service was fantastic, very friendly and helpful. The pizza was good, but it could have been a little fresher. I got the lunch special and they have the pizzas ready to go and just reheat the slices. I have a feeling that a freshly made pizza from this place would be amazing, because the reheated slices that were a little dry were still pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for many years. They are renowned for their steak subs, and not there Pizza. Their steak subs are superior to anything on the menu. Nowhere in the Charlotte area has cheese steak subs like House Of Pizza."}
{"text":"Have been eating there since college in the early 80s. Have always gotten sandwiches till just recently. Pizza is good but I'm more of a sandwich lover.  Beef sandwich has always been a big winner!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"There's a part of me that wants to give this restaurant like a 2, and part of me that wants to give it a 5. It's great for what it's great for, but you should be aware when you're going to hit this place that it's a particular type of Italian food that I like to refer to as \"ghetto Italian.\" 

It's kind of like the Italian food you'd make at home, but slightly better. I haven't had their pizzas, but I've had their veggie lasagna and a few other pasta dishes. They are always delicious, but not date-night, wearing your stilettos delicious. They are delicious in the, \"Hey, I just was shopping at Wal-Mart and I'd like to pig out on a huge lasagna\" kind of way.

The service is pretty fast, the decor is pretty cheesy, and the food is solid. It's worth investigating...and it's the kind of place I come back to again and again, without really meaning to. It's just there, and the hot ravioli calls to me like a beacon in the night."}
{"text":"Moved to Charlotte in '93 and this place has been open for over 40 years and I never ate here before. Weird. I used to live on the east side for many years. Usually go to portifino's but never ever again(see review to find out why). 

Anyway me and my brother decided to try it out. Very packed. Limited parking. Parked on the side of the building. Went around 7pm on a Saturday I believe. Very old looking place. Bathroom was very small. Looks like a locker room bathroom. 2 small stalls barely enough room to wash your hands. 

Everywhere looked dingy but not dirty I guess. Sn: Always Wash your hands after ordering. Menus are gross. Table and menu were kind of sticky. Seats weren't that much cleaner. Maybe it was a busy night for them. No paper towels in the bathroom had to use a napkin I had in my bag to open the door after drying my hands with the oldest hand dryer ever. Another side note: never touch public door handles with your bare hands esp in the restroom(e.coli is hella real). Call me weird but I never get sick and I'm a nurse(we are all a little weird I think lol). Anyway...

Salad was horrible. Didn't touch it. See pics. The bottle that the dressing came in...Omg.  Didn't look clean at all. Maybe keeps getting Refilled but not cleaned. Chicken Alfredo was bland and way too much Alfredo sauce for my liking. Garlic bread was ok(I make better way better). My brother ordered a Philly. Both entrees were not so good. 

Ordered a large pizza to go for my little cousins. I ate a slice on the way there(Barely ate my food so I was hungry) and Omg it was so delish. I guess we both ordered wrong. The pizza was where it was at! Hence the name. I guess I'll get pizza next time. 

Had I known about their pizza I would have stopped going to the other pizzeria down the road a long time ago. The location is very homely and sketchy looking But that's usually where you get the best food. The Pizza was very good! And I really love pizza. Maybe too much. 

The server was ok. She checked on us and the food came out quick. Reminds me of Waffle House staff(I love Waffle House but we all know the people there can be pretty interesting). Just random looking people if you know what I mean. From what I can see the front was clean and they have a good score. So I would def go back. But only for the pizza and nothing else."}
{"text":"We got take out from House of Pizza recently and the first thing I noticed is old décor. It seriously looks like they haven't changed in thing in 20 years. It really did remind of pizza places from back when I was a kid. The other thing I really liked about it was that it was very different form a chain pizza place. 

We ordered the house special pizza and it was great. The crust is a little on the thick side, but not as thick as a pan pizza. It is nice and crispy and there are very generous portions of toppings and cheese. I thought the pizza was priced very reasonably (~$17 for a large). 

My brother in law told me he used to have little league banquets here over 30 years ago. It is great a place can stay in business that long and serve consistently good food. I will def. be back here on a future trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Whooooooo they have one of the best Pizza and the service was awesome the location is great I didn't eat pizza like that for long time House of pizza they have a really great prices I will come back again and I do recommend that place to anyone great pizza......."}
{"text":"Ordered a Hawaiian Pizza, chicken fingers and fries, and 2 2-litre bottles of soda for delivery on Sunday, June 12.  My daughter said the fingers were good, but my pizza was luke-warm when it arrived and the crust was just above a thin crust style; like I was eating cardboard.  Reheated the rest the next day and it was worse.  Ended up throwing the remaining pizza away.  Honestly, I have had better tasting pizza at other places.  This was our first time trying this place, however I think it will be quite awhile before I order from them again, If I do at all.  Spending $16 on a pizza I expect to have more flavor, especially the sauce and the ability to enjoy the leftovers.  I just was not that impressed.  Better off doing your research.  Lots of other Italian places to choose from."}
{"text":"The pizza I got yesterday was terrible, however they said they would replace it, so I am going now to see how it is.  I never had a bad pizza here until yesterday. so, it could have been someone who didn't know what to do."}
{"text":"I ordered a large cheese steak, with mushrooms, onions, and peppers. 

House of Pizza's large cheese steak is a LLLLLARGEEEEEE sandwich.
The combo comes with ruffled potato chips. 
The large cheese steak is almost $10, which is acceptable given the size and quality.

Service is pretty good, but not exceptional. I ordered a Diet Pepsi and my waitress brought me an iced tea. {shrug} I got this corrected without any drama.

They were good about keeping beverages refilled, which is my major pet peeve. They were also good at bussing and cleaning the tables when diner's left. 

The kitchen was generous with the steak and the mozzarella cheese atop the sandwich. They were also ample amounts of peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The bread was nice and crusty on the outside and tender in the middle.....really delicious. It was a VERY satisfying sandwich for a cheese steak lover.
 
They include mayonnaise on their cheese steak, which is definitely not traditional. I didn't have any problem with that. 

Advice:
- Hot cherry peppers hoagie spread,\" would add flavor and spice to their cheese steaks. It is available in every grocery store.
- They need to add a little salt and pepper to the steak as it is being cooked.
- I would have appreciated some garlic powder on the tables or sautéed crushed garlic in the cooked meat. It makes the sandwich mo better. ;o)

The men's bathroom? Gross. 

There was also no room in the men's restroom for anyone with a wheelchair, which bothers me. 

Current sanitation rating as of 4/11/2015 = 94.5%"}
{"text":"This is actually kind of funny. I called to order a pizza and the kid asks me to hold. But he doesn't put the phone on hold, he just sets the receiver down. So I hear him ring up two customers and then...nothing more from him. I hang on hoping he still remembers me, Then I hear the other line ring and a girl answers who starts to take an order! I finally got my head out of my butt and hung up. I've had two pizzas from House of Pizza. The first was simple and tasty. The second one, and I can't remember which, was heavy, loaded with several ingredients, and was inedible. I'm done."}
{"text":"They have amazing pizza here and great options to go with it. On top of that I think they have amazing ownership behind the business. As a small business owner myself, I can appreciate the way the business is run. Thank you for all that you do and for taking care of us customers. If you are looking for good food and/or a great local small business to give your support to, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place has remained open. I tried them for the second time and it was even worse than the first. We had delivered and it was unbelievable fast service, only to find out it was a completely wrong order. I should have known it was too good to be true. Absolutely never again.

Edit: this is a review of the Las Vegas location to be fair. Look at the reviews. I'm not the only that thinks this place is terrible."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place but when we got our pizza delivered (that took over an hour and 20 min) the pizza ended up being dry and burnt! I wish we would have taken a picture of it. We had to call twice to see where our pizza was before it was delivered.  I was just really disappointed as was my boyfriend we will not be going/ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Pizza is great here, so is the service.  The place is owned by Italian natives who really know how to cook up a pizza pie!  Dan and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was hopping, but we didn't have to wait.  Our server was a young Italian woman who made us feel very at home.  We never had to wait for her to refill our drinks and the pizza was made within ten minutes.  I am a vegetarian and Dan isn't, but there was no problem splitting two toppings on each side with no extra charge.  The cheese was scruptous and fresh, and we didn't leave a slice behind.  

Pictures of Italy decked the walls and the waitresses talked amongst one another in a sultry Italian tongue.  It really was an authentic Italian dining experience!"}
{"text":"The best place in Charlotte for a Cheese Steak!!! Yummy!!! I've been here plenty of times and never even had a slice of pizza (and I LOVE pizza lol) but I'm too obsessed with the Cheese Steaks to even try!!! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Something about walking into House of Pizza makes me want to quit life and open a restaurant. (Which is funny because I already work in a restaurant.) Maybe it's the homey atmosphere, maybe it's the food that's so good you want to hug it, maybe it's the waiters so cute you want to hug them. This is definitely one of Charlotte's hidden gems.

On the surface, it's not much to brag about, but the food more than makes up for it. From pizza and sandwiches, to Greek favorites like gyros and spanikopita, to desserts, you can't go wrong. And it's so low-priced you might as well get one of everything. Definitely a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"One of the best in the neighborhood and well worth the wait! They've just remodeled and everything looks great! Food is always on point and the portions are well worth the small price"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Drive by all the time and never stopped. Decided to try today. That is some real good food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and reasonable prices! Will definitely come back! And they have spumoni which is awesome! I lived in New York and can attest this tastes like New York pizza!"}
{"text":"Just like being in NYC only better 
Love this place
You feel like your in Manhattan without all the traffic . The food is spot on and the staff make you feel like your family ."}
{"text":"New York Pizza by New Yorkers...

What makes a great pizza? Is it the dough, water or is it that special ingredient that has been passed down generation to generation? 

Located along West Lake Mead and Del Webb rd, House of Pizza will have you wanting that extra slice every time. Ordering the Works pizza to go, I was honestly a little surprised at the layout and effort that has gone into this place. It really does seem like a pizza joint staight out of a corner of the big apple.

The dough of the pizza was actually one of the best parts, the crust was soft and really had a nice flavor to it. The ingredients seem to be fresh with a decent serving. I will recommend some of the pastries they offer. I'm not sure if they are made onsite or not but the custard pastry was amazing.  

A nice flat screen is on the wall that shows whatever game is on and the soda selection is quite extensive. Also I over heard the owner saying that the recipes were his grandfathers.

Not a bad little find House of Pizza. Service and quality of pizza is something I look forward to eating again soon.

Overall
Food: 5-5
Service: 4-5
Drink: 4-5
Coming back: Yes"}
{"text":"I've been a few times this year. Nice staff, I love the pasta and wings mostly. Haven't tried the sandwiches but they are on my list."}
{"text":"I just love this food! It's always delicious and the service is pretty good! I am the kind of girl that just likes good food and this is the kind of spot that keeps me coming back for more! Yum!"}
{"text":"We tried this place one night on a whim for a very late dinner, and were pleasantly surprised!!  This isn't thin crust gourmet true Italian pizza by any means, but it was delicious! I have no idea what they put in the crust, but I really liked it. Slightly chewy with sweet and savory notes -- different and it totally works with the pizza.  I ordered the Greek pizza, and it was awesome!! I was craving a gyro and pizza, but couldn't decide between the two... This was the perfect option.  Super cheesy, lots of awsome toppings, and the perfect balance of meat with olives, green peppers, and feta.  The only thing that I can say is that it was definitely more of a \"fork and knife\" kind of pizza -- not a thin foldable slice lol.

In any event, we will definitely be back whenever we crave good old fashioned cheesy down home pizza!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Definitely NY style. good quality cheese and sauce is tasty. This will be my new pizza place."}
{"text":"GREEK PIZZA. You must try it. I am obsessed with it; I moved to the East side a few months ago and was intrigued by the packed parking lot HOP always seems to have going. Then I tried the Greek Pizza and learned why.
The crust was a bit thick but perfectly chewy; the feta cheese, if not house-made, was at least made by someone who knows what they're doing. Creamy, a bit of that rind taste I love, and the fresh onion, fresh green bellpepper toppings were the right note to play off the grilled lamb gyro meat. It's the only pie I've tried so far, because when I walk in the door I can't make my mouth say anything else. I may be able to see other pizzas soon, but right now I am completely infatuated.
Oh yeah, old school decor, blah blah blah. GREEK PIZZA."}
{"text":"New open feel is nice. Still working out the kinks but smiles all around and food looks just as good as before. A long line to go."}
{"text":"Yes the food is great, but I want to spend my money where I think it is appreciated. The sister (family owned business) has the worst attitude. I've seen her talk to the employees like crap. Last night, my server quoted me the wrong price. She wouldn't honor what my server stated. Any other time I wouldn't have blinked twice at the lack of training or inconsistency, but how she talked to me was horrible. I informed her that I would no longer be coming back and she replied, \" Fine, ok, don't come back.\" Not once did she say, he was wrong. I'm sorry for the confusion. How can I fix this mistake? Bad customer service + bad attitude = one less patron"}
{"text":"Great house special pizza! Subs are equally good. Went on Mother's Day and got a free piece of cheese cake."}
{"text":"One of my favorite truly local Charlotte spots.  It feels like you are walking into a restaurant that hasn't changed a lot over the years.   Quality Italian dishes, my favorite being the Ricotta shells and cheese!  The garlic bread is fantastic.  Their pizza isn't the best in Charlotte, but it's very solid.  I've also had their toasted Turkey and cheese sub, which was very good.  Prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Customer service has gone down hill. It appears the staff is always too busy to care if your a walk in. I waited several minutes to get recognized as a customer. Pizza given was not mine."}
{"text":"I was having a party and needed several pizzas at a specific time on a Saturday night. I wanted good pizza. A step up from the fast food places, but without spending $20+ on each pizza. I, also, wanted some variety. In my research I came across House of Pizza.

I went the day before to scope out the location in case I lived outside of the delivery radius AND to try a few slices before ordering for my party. The blonde girl running the counter was pretty great. She answered all my questions about ordering for the next day, and seemed eager for my business. She said if I was ordering a lot, they would deliver outside of the 5 mile radius & they only needed an hour or so of notice...things like that. The slices I tried weren't part of the 2 slices & a soda special for $4.50 (that's only for cheese?). I tried the white & the pepperoni. Honestly, they looked a bit dried out behind the glass case, but the same girl warmed them up for me...and they were delicious...AND HUGE. For my 2 (non cheese) slices and a bottle of water the bill was under $7.

It is kind of a small place with very little seating. And, it is on a section of W Lake Mead I just never go to (until now). They also have very nice expensive take out menus. I used to work in commercial printing many moons ago, so this detail was not lost on me...heavy cardstock, double sided color, glossy!!! LOL

On the day of my party we called at 5pm and were adamant about a 630pm delivery, and they assured us it would be on time...and it was! They had sent an extra sausage pizza \"just because\" along with tons of parmesan & crushed red pepper packets and paper plates. We ordered 2 cheese, a meat lovers, a veggie, and a buffalo chicken. All large. Again, the slices are pretty huge...for all the bill was $86 plus tip. There were 14 people at the party and we still had over a whole pizza's worth left over. Everything was hot and delicious...and on time with extras!!! Several people emailed me afterward asking for the name of the pizza place because it was so good. I will, also, add I do not like anything even a little spicy, but I LOVED the buffalo chicken pizza!!! I HIGHLY recommend ordering that one. And, I never eat sausage, but their sausage pizza was delicious.

FANTASTIC SERVICE & FOOD!!!

Even though they are a,little bit out of the way for me, I'm definitely making House of Pizza my new pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I work on the same plaza and found them by accident. Every time I go in there, I feel like I walk into New York. The guys that work there seem like true Italian New Yorkers.  They are really laid back and have great customer service! The food is delicious!  I always get the white pizza with red peppers. I'm not an olive fan, but for some reason I love the olives on their salads. I've gotten the alfredo pasta a few times and it was actually good. I'm used to watered down, not too flavorful pasta at these kinds of pizza places, but their pasta and sauce was delicious and not watery. I love that randomly they also offer you some freebies as well. Today, the guy was experimenting with Nutella and we were the lucky people that got to try it! Overall, love this place! Great food and family friendly down to earth service!"}
{"text":"My wife went there to order food due to an error message from calling the published number. She was told they \"take phone off the hook or don't answer during busy hours\"....she got cursed out by a young man in the parking lot as he tried exiting the lot.... and was cursed and felt threatened and fearful for her safety....the food was cold when she got it home only a mile away......I have eaten at the place since I was a child but it appears the thrill is gone.....Pizza Peel less than a mile  away seems a better option and more importantly a safe one."}
{"text":"I am glad this place opened up because there are not that many independent pizza shops that deliver on this side of town.  I have ordered twice and the quality of the pizza improved on the second time.  I also love caprese salads, and they have a pretty good one."}

Mike and Matt are really nice and friendly.  Great food and service overall.    Will definitely be back soon for other items in the future."}
{"text":"I love love love the white pizza!  The cheese is so light and fluffy on a great crust you can fold up and enjoy.  Pepperoni is great too. My kids love the cheese, they actually eat more than one piece!  My wife loves the gluten free pizza. They have great deals for lunch, for takeout, buy a whole pie or just a few slices. Get dessert too. Super friendly staff, and they added a tv recently too. Did I mention we've been 4 times in less than 2 months? My new favorite, so good. Just are a few hours ago and I still want more!"}
{"text":"I'd heard so much about the meatball sub that I was pretty excited to give it a go. Unfortunately it just ended up being this gargantuan salty deal that just didn't really bring anything to the table besides lots of salt. Maybe I was there on an off day but I wasn't impressed. The portion, as mentioned before, was redic. So, if you're feeding a high school football team or something maybe it's worth a stop."}

By the end of the work week I am DONE with cooking and I often don't want to leave my house ...pizza is nearly always our Friday go-to dinner. I enjoy Hawthornes, but my husband does not...he enjoys Dominoes, but I do not. We both like Intermezzo but it can get a little steep for our newlywed budget so our solution is House of Pizza.

It doesn't look all that great in all honesty but it tastes pretty darn good. They don't skimp on cheese (though sauce is lacking a bit)..so it works for us. Now this isn't the best pizza in the world but it certainly isn't the worst. A pie will set you back like $11 for cheese so you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Review Update: They have reinstated their delivery, so I am updating and upgrading my review. Am happy that they are again delivering and will be able to resume ordering pizza. We like their thin crust and think that they have one of the best tasting pizzas in the area. Thanks for getting the delivery service back in action and being responsive to the neighborhood.

Very disappointed that they have discontinued pizza delivery. We like their pizza and ordered on a regular basis. Apparently as of the first of the new year they are no longer making deliveries. There aren't that may choices for good pizza in our area and even less for a place that delivers. We hope they give this some additional thought and/or enough people speak up and ask them to reconsider."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today with coworkers for a quick lunch. It has standard New York style slices of pizza for $2.25, which is a good deal. I had a slice of works and a slice of white. After reheating in the oven, the pizza was nice and warm with a crisp crust, but not too crispy. Both were tasty, though I preferred the works. The white pizza had too much ricotta cheese in my opinion. I could've scraped off some of the extra ricotta, but I decided to finish the slice in its original form to get a feeling of this place's style. If I need a quick lunch and want pizza, I'd come here again."}

{"text":"The HoP is one of those places that should be great - it's been there forever (and when I say forever, I mean as long as I've been in Charlotte, which means quite a long time), and it looks it. Anything that manages to last that long in this town has some serious staying power. On the downside, they have done absolutely zero to update the place - that can either add some major props or knock you a few points, Here, we'll call it a push, because in Charlotte, having at least a couple of things that haven't yet been torn down is nice.

When it comes to the staff, they are typically friendly, but not in on overly creepy way, so they make you feel comfortable and welcome, which is all you can ask. The menu pretty well matches up with the decor, in that it doesn't look like it has been updated in years, and if it's good, there is no reason that it should be.

Food comes out quickly, which is a big reason to visit, and though they are called house of pizza in the big glowing neon, they offer far more than just pizza - plenty of pasta can be found on the menu, and sandwiches as well. Just be careful if you order the pasta, because it comes out hot. So hot, in fact, that you will burn the roof off your mouth and the cheese will sear your brain so that you can't taste anything for a week.

So step into Charlotte's past (there aren't many places that you can do so), give the plate a moment to cool off and relax while you enjoy your dinner. Or suck it down as soon as it's delivered. Either way, there aren't many like this around any longer."}
{"text":"I overheard a girl talking about House of Pizza one day... she was RAVING ON AND ON AND ON about how it was the absolute best pizza hands down in the whole wide world and \"since she's from connecticut where they have the best pizza, she should know\".  

I admit, it spiked my curiosity enough to try it, even though we've passed by it regularly over the past few years and never had the urge before.  We walked in, super excited to try out this amazing pizza.  The prices seemed a little steep, but for the best pizza, it must be worth it... so we ordered a medium all veggie pizza.  

When it came out and we saw the way the cheese looked and smelled, we just looked at each other in doubt, but still had high hopes and took our first bites.  After all, the cheese was soooooo thick it must be good.  After the first bite, Ben immediately exclaimed, \"was that girl HIGH when she ate this pizza?\"  I thought it tasted frozen... like something from a high school cafeteria... and the cheese had no flavor.  The mushrooms were canned and there was hardly any sauce.  I have no idea who would ever think this pizza is the best in the whole wide world... maybe it's all a matter of taste... but we are completely flabbergasted.   After discussing for a while what we were eating, we looked around and realized that no one else in the entire place was eating pizza.  The subs looked super popular and everyone seemed happy.  I don't think we ever even finished our leftovers.

I hate giving a place 1 stars, and recently I read on a friend's facebook update that they had just discovered HOP and couldn't believe that they had gone their whole lives in this neighborhood without having ever tried it.  They also thought it was amazing.  Again, we were completely baffled!  So, apparently it's a taste preference... but be warned."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight and it was so so. I had a Greek salad. It was good, but nothing special. My daughter had a small cheese pizza. I tried a slice and didn't finish it because it was bland. Everything about it--crust, sauce, cheese--nothing was special. My husband had a large steak sub. It was HUGE and looked good, but I didn't try it. Glad we tried the place, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Come for the delicious pizza, and stay for the amazing conversations! 
While the look of the old building and interior decor may not seem that impressive, the pizzas that they make are well worth stopping in for. My wife and I each got a small salad and then split the veggie pizza.  The pizza sauce was a little sweet but not overly so.  They are very generous with the toppings, and the crust (flaky, soft, and yeasty with a nice handle on it) was perfect.  The best part of the ambience here is the motley crew of folk who dinner here, from local urbanites to nerdy blue collar types who just want to talk about movies and games with their colleagues while chomping on some fine Italian fare.  Be sure to bring a few bucks for juke box and listen to the local chatter in between jams. Also, on the positive note the price is right and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favorite hidden gem places in Charlotte. 

If you've never been to House of Pizza, there's a good chance you've driven by this place and never even gave it a second thought. It looks like a total dive.

Here's my suggestion for ordering: take a friend. Why? So you can order a cheesesteak AND a pizza. Duh. #SharingIsCaring The house dressing they bring to the table for salads is money. You may walk in and think you don't need a salad. Yes, yes you do. The answer is always yes.

Is it the best food you'll ever have? No. Is it great for what it is and price? Oh hells yeah. Since I can't actually live in a house made of pizza, this is the next best thing."}
{"text":"House of Pizza. Not to be confused with some of the other Inns and Huts. They can't hold a candle to the House. They've been here forever, and walking inside feels like time travel (in all the good ways). With specialties in pizza and subs, with Greek influences sprinkled in (like any good restaurant in the QC), you need to get to House of Pizza. Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it.

I've not tried the sandwiches yet (next visit), but the pizza is incredible. The sauce has great flavor but doesn't overpower, and they are generous with the toppings. Now, I'm not a fan of the floppy, ends-up-in-your-lap NY style pizza. House of Pizza has those big slices, but the crusty is substantial to support all the goodies on top. Finally, someone who gets what a crust should be!

The people who work here are absolutely great. The whole place feels like sitting in a relative's kitchen. One of the best pizza places in Charlotte, hands down."}
{"text":"We went to this place tonight as we have many times.  Tonight while my husband was eating his pizza he chewed on a nut from a screw.  Due to him being diabetic he had to eat his portion of the pizza.  My half was plain and I found what appeared to be a thin stick.  I left my half of the pizza.  The owner, rather than offering us a refund offered us a piece of cheesecake.  I was appalled.  Suppose my husband had broken a tooth or swallowed this nut from a screw.  I am seriously considering calling the Board of Health on Monday."}
{"text":"Great pizza place! I had the white pizza and the Chicken Picatta pizza. Both were great. I've also had the Sausage and Broccoli Rabe and the Pepper and Egg sandwiches, both were delicious and the bread was soft and fresh. 
My favorite thing about this place is that it's only 1 mile from home!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never given a review for this place. This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Charlotte. My girlfriend tried it, and she literally gave up the Olive Garden. Our favorite dish there is the egg plant Parmesan with a side of spaghetti and a salad with Greek dressing. And of course garlic bread. Believe it or not we've never tried the pizza, But it's definitely on my list. They have been remodeling the restaurant for at least the last year. I can't wait to begin going again once they reopen. Every month or so I try their phone number, and it still says out of order. Please, please, please hurry up and finish the remodel."}
{"text":"Literally JUST tried this place after years of living down the street. I was told by many that this place is delicious but I just didn't believe it. Today, my husband and I decided to give it a go for lunch. DELISH! We got a side order of meatballs as an appetizer and I could have literally ate them as a meal. So good. Sauce is to die for. We both got a sub...he got the turkey and I got the veal. They were very filling and both were tasty. I wish they had other side options as our only choice was chips, but other than that we had no complaints. Our server was friendly and happy, our beer was cold and our food was scrumptious! We will def go back."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have eaten at. I ordered at around 5:45... The pizza showed up around 7:45. The driver didn't have change. He charged me two dollars more than the bill was. It tastes like crap. Theres literally nothing about this place worth anything. The guy I called about it taking forever was even rude."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I have been here once, for carryout, since my last review. Same thing stands with the service, it's good.  Nothing to complain about there.  The people are friendly.  No wait on my food for pick up.

The red sauce is awful. It's orange-y in color and really just not tasty at all.  I'm warning you now, don't get it...& if you do, don't say I didn't tell you.

Fettuccine Alfredo! Good! I got this the last time and was pleased.  Delicious, creamy sauce & a yummy garlic bread to accompany it."}
{"text":"How to kill a pizza in three easy steps:

Unidentifiable white cheese, unbrowned.
Sauce you can see, but not taste.
Canned mushrooms.

The service was awesome (despite the two women working being a little overwhelmed by the never ending lunch crowd), the prices were decent, and the decor was bad ass... but the pizza, as advertised for on their huge, often-burnt-out neon piece dangling over Central, was pretty bad. Of course, we were the only people ordering it. Everyone else went with the house meat+cheese+white bread sub, served, interestingly, with BJ's-looking potato chips.

So was our tzatziki. Eh. Interesting execution of this Greek dip/sauce: sour creamish yogurt, shredded cuke, raw garlic. No herbs, pepper, salt. Turned out that this was the best part of the meal, and I enjoyed dipping something as weird as crappy chips into it and actually having them improve the taste.

Pluses include: $8 pasta specials that include garlic toast and salad, with a number of veg-friendly options. I might come back to try one of these lasagnas or raviolis or manicottis. But for pizza, I will head 'round the corner to Portofino's. Definitely."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!
Happy to have them in the neighborhood.
Typical italian pizza place but the food is so yummy"}
{"text":"The first time I came into this place I noticed the pizza slices looked horribly dry and old. So I ordered there $8.99 large pizza special. It was ok. But the lady that worked there seemed really nice and kind. The older gentleman making the pizza seemed a little cranky. Anyway we thought we would try it again tonight. Well when I first called the guy who answered told me about there $8.99 cheese pizza special (which I knew of, since I ordered it before) so I had to hang up and call back as I had a important call to take. When I did call back to make the order he told me they didn't have that special anymore? And the price was $12.99 I told him he just told me A few minutes ago different but he said he forgot it was a different price on different days! So I thought that was ridiculous but I ordered it anyway with extra cheese and light sauce and we ordered a meatball sandwich. The pizza did NOT have extra cheese and it didn't have light sauce. The sandwich would have been good if it had cheese on it like it was supposed to. They are very cheap on the cheese! Overall I'd say it's mediocre."}
{"text":"Love this place! Pizzas are OK but the beef sandwich (what their known for) is AMAZING! The interior hasn't been updated in almost forever but it doesn't matter, food is excellent and prices are very cheap."}
{"text":"Very mediocre pizza. The crust was like cardboard. The sauce was really watery and had zero flavor. The cheese was really tough and rubbery. We ordered and sausage and meatball pizza and the meatballs were frozen meatballs cut as thin as pepperonis. I've never seen such a sloppy attempt at a pizza. The staff wasn't very friendly either. It was an all around bad experience. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Had a bad pizza and left a review.  Mike, the owner, contacted me and asked me to give them another try, which I did.  
Mike was very gracious and kind when we spoke.  He would not allow me to pay for the new pie and even insisted on throwing in some Coke and an eclair.  The pizza was good with a ton of toppings, the crust is outstanding!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The pizza here is phenomenal!!  Still in search of other places as good as this one for the pizza.  The atmosphere is meh....but it goes w/the territory on this side of town you know.  Also their house salad dressing is pretty good.  A+++ love this place...."}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Garlic Knots with Marinara
New York Slice with Pepperoni
Sicilian Slice
Grandma Slice
Tiramisu
Cannoli

Recently brought up in conversation as one of the \"Top 10\" pizzas in the city, House of Pizza - New York Style on West Lake Meade Boulevard clearly warranted a look considering its proximity to home and the assertion of transplants that a \"good slice\" was nowhere locally to be found, the results far from justifying any such accolades while the scene itself was undeniably one of the most bizarre in town.

Located in the same small shopping plaza as the amusingly named New York Chinese Restaurant, House of Pizza is immediately identifiable due to the blaring voice of Frank Sinatra emitted from an outdoor speaker and not-so-subtle window painted signage, entry just past 11:15am seeing music give way to equally loud CNN political discourse as wall-to-wall Yankees memorabilia quickly flooded the visual field.

Just opened at 11am, a few pies already cooling on racks as a small menu hangs overhead, it was with greetings from the lone clerk that the ordering process was sorted, the owner and a friend sitting idly at a table, talking over the television before pulling out a wad of money and counting it in the dining room as though there was no one but the two of them to be bothered.

Offering several \"deals\" for slices plus beverages, none of which applied to a $1.59 bottle of water that was offered as the only option in the face of a request for a cup from the tap, further financial insult was added when the clerk neglected to add a 10% Social Media discount before running the credit card despite fully acknowledging it twenty seconds earlier, an offer to cancel and reprocess refused as $2.54 hardly seemed worth the hassle and potential double charge.

Taking a seat amidst the ongoing Mob-like scene of bills being filed into white envelopes it was at most five minutes before the two plastic clamshells were delivered tableside, a $4 filled-to-order Cannoli joining Tiramisu from the refrigerator with each pleasant, though nothing worth writing home about, the rest of the order emerging from the kitchen after just a few more moments.

At this point frankly amused by the fact that one person was acting as cashier, clerk, prep-cook and server the scene grew even more perplexing when the young lady was charged with the task of driving down to Starbucks to buy the owner \"a Caramel Macchiato - the biggest one they got,\" the four-part order quickly discovered to be vastly underheated as relates to the Grandma Square and Sicilian while the Knots and Pepperoni Slice were both hot.

Now left with just the owner and his counting, a question of \"you good?\" offered before he returned to the back, first bites of the slice showed a complete lack of char but generally good crust structure and Tomato Sauce, the Garlic Knots featuring a pleasant bit of \"chew\" compared to most while the aforementioned lack of heat significantly compromised both of the thicker wedges, though even if well-cooked they'd have fallen far short of the quality at Metro Pizza, Cugino's, Pizza Rock and many more.

**  Perhaps not their best showing, though not really excusable as I was not only the first customer of the day but also the only one present throughout my stay, House of Pizza falls far short in almost every way possible, particularly in a city with so much great Pizza to be found at a variety of price ranges."}
{"text":"pizza here is great. great variety menu. price is that bad at all. 2 slices of pizza and a drink. pepperoni and sausage for $5.50 everyday. hot, fresh and real NY style pizza. definitely going to eat here more often."}
{"text":"We drive by this place often and say \"it looks so sketchy that it must be great!\" Well...it isn't. It isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great. 

Highlights:
- we had great service. Everyone was nice and friendly.
- prices were very reasonable and you got a ton of food for a low price
- the sweet tea was good and they kept it coming
- the house vinaigrette was good. Kinda sweet but pretty good. 

Lowlights can be summed up in one word - FOOD:
- the house salad came with lettuce, onion, green pepper and tomato. I wish there had been croutons or something to mix up the textures. 
- the food in general was just not great. I had the chicken parmesan and the marinara sauce didn't have any robust flavors. The chicken didn't taste fresh. There was (and some people may think I'm crazy) way too much cheese on the chicken. I had to scrape most of it off. I literally had three bites of the meal and was done. Even my garlic bread didn't have a strong garlic taste. My fella had the cheesesteak (which the waitress described as \"awesome\") but the bite I had was bland. In my opinion- the philly cheesesteaks at Jersey Mike's on East Blvd are much, much, MUCH better. 

I've eaten at worse places. But I've definitely eaten at better. If we ever go here again, I'd opt for the pizza and hope for better flavor."}
{"text":"Please cook your calzones longer.  The insides of mine were lukewarm at best.  The dough isn't very good either.  The whole thing tastes like something found in the frozen section of a supermarket."}
{"text":"They offer takeout, but don't answer the telephone. Get ride of the feature if you can't fulfill it. So House of Pizza I really wanted to like you, but you ruined it for me."}
{"text":"House of Pizza has been in Charlotte forever.  Its a little hole in the wall type of place, but the food is really good.  Their pizza tastes like as if I am in New York.  Their pizza is extra cheesy and the cheese just slides off."}
{"text":"I was contemplating writing a review for a while now. This place had a shaky start, got really good, and then tanked because of their lack of delivery and new employees. 

We recently tried them again and as I was walking in the owner was hiring two new delivery people. He had brand new delivery decals and equipment (like those black padded bags for keeping the pizza hot). It was refreshing to see that he cared enough to really listen to the customers and bring back delivery. 

We ordered a few slices of pizza and meatballs. Everything was on point. The cheese is amazing, the sauce is fresh, and the thin crust is crisp. There is no better pizza in town and I'm glad we can start going back here."}
{"text":"Ordered online, arrived 5 min early and order was ready.  The works pizza with a well done crust, wings, and an eclair.  Pizza was great, don't let the front fool you, this is a great pizza.  Wings good eclair as well.  Owner called me by name, overall very nice."}
{"text":"Authentic fresh homemade Italian food, family owned business,  generous people, fabulous pizza, pasta and deserts!"}
{"text":"So this is not the greatest Italian place in the world, but it's definitely good.  You get a good value and good food.  Is it as good as Mama Ricotta's?  No.  But for a divey Greek/Italian place it is worth visiting for sure.

The large subs are pretty big so be forewarned.  Most people would be fine with the small."}
{"text":"House of Pizza is a Charlotte staple. It's a small, family run restaurant that has been around for many years; since I can remember. We often get take out, and occassionally will dine in. The food is consistently good, as are the service and prices. This is not a high end artisan pizzeria, but rather, a good ol' family run pizza joint. We are lucky to live nearby. Being primarily pizza eaters, we haven't tried all of the menu items, but the famous philly cheese steak sub is awesome. The lasagna is good too. The decor is a bit dated and the rug a bit worn, but this is as it should be in such a long running establishment!"}
{"text":"Being a born and bred New Yorker and having eaten in so many Pizzarias I've lost count,I have one question regarding this place.  How do you call yourself a New York style pizza shop and cook your pies on a Dominos style belt oven?
I have never seen NY style pizza cooked on a belt.  It is always cooked in a deck oven which is what gives it a distinctive char and chew.
I tried this place and the pizza is bland and has no texture.  The guy behind the counter whose name was \"Magic\" (go figure) had the nerve to compare his pies to L&B Spumoni Garden in Brooklyn NY.  Are you kidding me? Anyone who knows NY pizza knows L&B knows there is n o comparison.
Get over yourselves guys.  You're not that good.  You're a step above Domino's and that's not saying much.  You only get 2 stars because your pizza was edible."}
{"text":"We've heard great things about House of Pizza so wanted to try it for ourselves. Even though we were seated next to the hostess stand and there were several servers available, we could not get waited on. If you're willing to deal with an unfriendly and lackadaisical wait staff in order to get good food then this is the place for you. To sum up...Food is good, but the service is terrible."}
{"text":"Sweet people,  they make you feel welcome!  We had the large grilled chicken salad and large extra special pizza , great portion and amazing flavor !  Not greasy at all and fresh veggies with the salad. Highly recommended !!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and their pizza continues to amaze me! My go to pizza is the house special. Their subs and pasta dishes are also delicious."}
{"text":"The Italian dishes are just wonderful. I love dipping the garlic bread in all the extra marinara sauce they give you! Go on a weekend and ask for Harry. He will treat you right!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how everything could be this wrong and this cold, but it is.  I ordered MILD wings, easy sauce, and got MEDIUM wings (written on the cover) dripping in sauce.  I ordered a half meatball/half ham pizza, the pizza is covered in both toppings.  Why offer half and half pizza if you don't know what it means?  And, considering they're less than 2 miles from my place, my food should not have been stone cold.  First and last time ordering from this place."}
{"text":"Cute place!! The owner is very nice as well!! Pizza was good but not the best I've had... It's a good spot to get your pizza craving though.."}
{"text":"Great pizza, good prices. Atmosphere inside is authentic and it shows. People are friendly. Place is clean and tidy. Pizza is cooked in a timely fashion and to perfection."}
{"text":"This place is interesting.  From the outside it's very unassuming.  Run down isn't the right way to describe it, but it's close.  You could drive by every day for a year and never notice it.  when you step  inside, though, it is like stepping into a time machine.  The walls are wood paneled, everything looks like it might've been fancy twenty years ago,and the placemats are paper.  I think they forgot to give us our crayons.  I had a witty comment about the wall art, but I forgot what it looked like.  It's that kind of place.

Anyway, on to the positives.  Our waitress was really, really nice.  The prices are nice and low, too. The entrees are in the nine-twelve dollar range (don't quote me), and come with a salad and garlic bread.  I decided I couldn't go wrong with lasagna and was pleasantly surprised.  It was flavorful and did not have a cookie cutter taste.  the portion size was more than ample and there is a wide selection of cheap wine to choose from.  I guess it was kind of like eating at the genesis of Macaroni Grill.

When you take into account quality, price, atmosphere, and quantity The House of Pizza is a  solid value.  I'd go again.... if someone asked me to.  Maybe."}
{"text":"Alright, this place gets four stars because of the pizza here. It is one if the best places for pizza in Charlotte. They are also fast and friendly. I have never eaten dine in but I have ordered many take out pizzas of all kinds. 

With that said, the only reason I did not give five stars is becuase I have not had luck with other entress. I tried the meatball sub, which I will never order again, and the philly, which was so so. I have heard the italian sub is great. 

I do recommend here, but mainly for the melt in your mouth pizza. Hey, why order anything else when the name of the place is House of Pizza."}
{"text":"I only eat here if I have to.

\"Cheese bread\" is basically dinner rolls cut in half with some mozzarella thrown on top and broiled which for some reason takes almost 20 minutes?

The pizza is actually quite good, but since everything else isn't all that great, it deters me from wanting to come eat here. The service could use a few pointers on things like smiling....

So. I call in a pizza every now and then and give them a few extra minutes to prepare it. That way we're all happy!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizza Ive ever had! I don't even order pizza often so this was a total disappointment. The pizza was DRY as a bone and rubbery. I mean It is like biting into a soft rubber. I can't believe that to even be possible. It was virtually inedible. So disappointed
Updated- I called to tell them about the pizza being cold, sauceless and rubbery.. Guy on the phone didn't give a royal hell and I asked to speak to a manager.. He's not there. 8pm on a Friday? Hmm ok. Asked him to have him call me. Never did."}
{"text":"the house is a very good place for italian food at it's best ,and the subs omg!!!!!!!!!!,you can't go wrong give them a try i bet you will go back!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place about a month ago and tonight was my 5th and LAST time ever going. Ordered pizza and wings. Out of an order of wings 4 of them were so small that they should have been thrown away instead of served to customers. I uploaded a picture for you to see for yourself. Look in the photos and you will see a chicken wing next to a sugar packet. The sugar packet is bigger than the chicken wing. In my entire life I have never seen wings this small. Since an order of wings is $10 bucks I said something to our waitress assuming these wings just slipped by and I would receive an apology and a few more wings thrown into the fryer that were bigger than a half inch. Well, I received an apology from the waitress but when she asked the owner if she could rectify the problem with a few more normal sized wings she was told NO!
Never have I been victim to such awful customer service in my entire life. This place could have had a customer for life with my wife and I, now I can guarantee I will never step foot in the House of Pizza ever again."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! Everything about this place is great. This was our first time eating at House of Pizza and coming from two East Coasters I can honestly say this is the closest and most delicious thing we've had to real deal East Coast pizza. The staff is SO nice and that's saying something since I was wearing my Red Sox shirt not realizing this was a Yankees pizza shop lol. The decor is all Yankees which is super cool if you're a fan. We were fortunate enough to meet Vinny, one of the owners who couldn't possibly have made us feel more welcome. Even their desserts are made in house and they're SO GOOD!! Our new favorite pizza shop."}
{"text":"Enjoy the nice pizza. I order extra sauce on the pep. I like the extra flavor. The homemade cannoli  is delicious.   
Pizza takes 10-12 minutes."}
{"text":"Nothing really special, but good. Not a lot of small Italian places to go eat in Charlotte so this one fills the spot nicely. Pizza is pretty good, sauce is a pretty basic marinara. Chicken parm was tasty, again the meat sauce good use a little more seasoning. Great garlic bread and dressings with their salads."}
