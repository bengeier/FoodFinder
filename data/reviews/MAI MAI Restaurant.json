{"text":"Looks like a hole in the wall but the food is surprisingly good. The general Tao chicken is tasty and is actual chicken, not fatty leftovers like most Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"4 stars given in comparison to the other Chinese restaurants in the area. We ordered take out to serve some friends who were coming over. We order out a lot. Haha! Anyhow, we found this place off the just eat website where you put in your postal code, and it popped up. We ordered tons of food high included,  1) fried bacon and shrimp dumplings, 2)wonton soup  3) Cantonese chow mein  4)pad Thai  5) black bean chicken  6) general tso's chicken and 7) tofu with mixed vegetables.  The best dishes were # 1,3,5,7 and the worst was 4, with 6 as a close 2nd. FYI, I'm referring to my above numbering system and not the menu's. The General tso's was not balanced and had too much heat and tanginess when compared to other places. I told my hubby not to get #4 but he wanted to try it and of course it sucked. My rule is to NEVER order pad Thai from a non Thai restaurant! But whatever, we got it, and it was horrible. It was spicy (I love spicy but this was bad and out of place), and there was now sweet and salty balance that you should find in a Thai dish. I didn't mention the wonton soup as neither best nor worst because it was middle of the road. Basic broth, basic wonton flavor. #1 was a new fusion type appetizer that everyone LOVED. It's definitely not traditional Chinese. But no one cared! Lol! It was delicious and gone in minutes.  The Cantonese chow mein was a little greasy,  but tasty. I'm wondering if I asked for less oil, if they would oblige to that request. We'll have to try that for next time. :)  I enjoyed the black bean chicken because it wasn't overly salty, nor too saucy, but still managed to be very flavorful. The tofu dish was also a hit which I decided to eat the most of actually, since I'm a vegetable person. For where I live, this is one of the better Chinese spots, despite the bad pad Thai. We were pleasantly surprised with the Chinese food overall."}
{"text":"I went here on a fluke with my mom one night because we were craving some chinese. To be honest i was not expecting much from my meal i thought it would be your average sub par chinese take out, I WAS WRONG. Everything we got was absolutely delicious, the spring rolls were amazing they were not dry or greasy like the usual ones available. The general tso chicken actually tasted like it was pieces of good quality white meat chicken. We also got the peking duck and that was yummy as well. Seriously one of my top chinese restaurants now!"}
{"text":"Previously spolied by the overabundance and competitive quality of central/uptown Toronto delivery restaurants, I am choosing to not compare.  Etobicoke sucks for deivery selection and quality. I probably wouldn't order if sharing with others whom I wanted to impress, but the quality and price is generally acceptable.  Not bad, but ok. To specify, the sauces are a bit thin, but I would (and have) ordered again. They have a 20$ delivery minimum, which is very good for the single person.  Review update:  a 2.5 inch long black hair (with the root still attached) was found in the last order of lemon chicken."}
{"text":"Good prices and good quality food. Service is fast and with great quality, what more can you ask for. It is very accessible as well and has very nice employees. Will definitely be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"They really meed to get someone answering the phone who speaks and understands english. Pretty good fresh Chinese food tho and they are able to leave out or replace certain veg if you prefer. Delivery guys are very friendly."}
{"text":"Currently eating some of the best Canadian-Chinese delivery I've had in a long time. Yes this place looks sketchy on the outside but every thing is fresh tasting and hot. the delivery was quick and the delivery guy was polite. The spring rolls are HUGE and the wonton soup has bug pieces of pork in it. This is my new Chinese place!"}
{"text":"If you want cheap food with huge portions, I would recommend this restaurant. But don't expect nice service at all. And rice with beef or chicken comes for only 6$."}
{"text":"Have you ever found yourself in the south-west end of Toronto (around Humber College on Lakeshore) late on a Saturday night (around midnight) looking for good, cheap eats?  Well if pizza, \"Timmy's\"  and McD's won't satisfy, go Chinese, and try out Mai Mai Restaurant!  I discovered this humble little Chinese restaurant some time last year when I was coming off a shift at work and grabbing a meal for myself and a buddy.  After that first visit, I was hooked and became a regular.  The food is consistently great, I found the service is always friendly and appreciative, the delivery drivers are good too.  What you may think: the place looks run down, but it's clean and once you get over the looks, you'll discover that this is, hands down, the best Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"There's a hair in the house fried rice I ordered. And I thought there's supposed to be pork and shrimp in the house special fried rice? But it's rice mixed with dif vegetables ( tasted not good and when I saw the hair in the it I almost puked)....  very bad experience I don't wanna order from this restaurant ever again! Food quality is bad."}
{"text":"As a local Chinese restaurant I would say this place serves the best Chinese food in this area for the price. All their dishes are a reasonably priced and the portions they serve are just the right amount. I have tried many of the combination plates that cost less than $10 dollars, and many signature dishes such as Chicken balls, General Tsao Chicken and Cantonese chow me in that is very worth my money! All the dishes I have tried so far are very tasty and delicious!  I would recommend this place is anyone who is in this area who wants affordable Chinese food! Their customer service is great and the restaurant is very clean!"}
{"text":"I discovered Mai Mai a couple of months ago when I finally decided to explore part of Lakeshore for the first time. The food was amazing!!! I have no complaints whatsoever. I also found the prices to be reasonable. I said I would go back and I did last night! The food rocked and I was full for hours! I also like that I can walk to Sweet Olenka's for dessert afterwards! :)"}
{"text":"I always order delivery food from this restaurant and its pretty decent, depending on the dishes you order of course. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"All I gotta say is, one of the worst Chinese food and service I encounter. Sounds great on paper, but nothing what it looks and sounds !!!!  Pretty disappointed overall I gotta say ... Sorry !"}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I are hungry we usually order here from JustEats. Pretty good food. Not too big on the bubble tea but it's better than none."}
{"text":"This is a great little place; good food, clean and great value. Sure beats other Chinese places in the hood that are still tied to Day-Glo sauce! I love the fact that you can get Dim Sum items at any time  (love my BBQ pork buns). Dinner for two of us (including a beer) was just under $21. So convenient, right on the streetcar and not far from Humber College. Always surprised there are not more students there. Overall a great little place, not quite Spadina but great for the deep West-Enders. Check out the specials as they are wonderful value.  EDIT: One slight problem, woke up yesterday with swollen lips and welts all over my body. I always have a slight reaction to MSG but this was insane. Sorry Guys."}
{"text":"Have ordered from this restaurant a few times with mediocre results. Last night my new choice was closed so I ordered again. That was the last. I did not order the hair that came in the noodle dish - gag! - and the beef dish came with a different and less appealing combination of vegetables than indicated in the menu."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. A little pricey but they deliver late which is what we needed. We are visiting from the state's so I am not too familiar with the money. But it looks like I was shorted 3 dollars on change and given Ethiopian currency (1 coin). Not cool."}
{"text":"I've read through all these reviews considerately and the number one thing you should take from my review is Mai Mai is HIT OR MISS.   I've ordered from here a few times because it's the closest location for me to get Chinese food. I normally go for a typical combination, chicken fried rice, egg/spring rolls, beef & broccoli, chicken balls.   Sometimes the food is super fresh and tender, other times it's flavorless and somewhat stale. However I would never say this place is horrible. The food has never been so completely inedible or even worthy enough to send back for a refund.   You get what you pay for. The prices are relatively low. The food isn't among the top 10 best Chinese restaurants so don't expect that.  You can order online or on the app with ease, their menu is classic and easy to read, the workers are friendly, the restaurant itself is lacking comfort/decor but who cares."}
{"text":"For Chinese delivery in the area is quite decent.  Spring rolls crispy, hot and sour soup good balance of hot and sour (not too hot so if you like spicy you'll have to add a little heat). Chicken chow mein flavour good, noodles could have been cooked a tiny bit more.  For the price it was quite good in terms of quantity and quality."}
{"text":"Walked by this place a few times and finally tonight decided to try it with the family.   This restaurant is very casual and informal, the kind of place where you can bring the family, chat in a relaxed atmosphere and read the newspaper at the table while sipping a beer (this restaurant is licensed!).   The customer service is pretty good, the owner/host was very eager to get my order right when I explained that I'd like to try their Singapore Noodles but without the meat or any other animal products, he told me he'll make sure to add extra veggies in place of meat.  My food was amazing; lots of flavour, perfectly cooked veggies, nice tofu and spiced just right.  My family also loved their food, we'll definitely come back to try more menu items and probably order home delivery."}
{"text":"My friend and I used to eat here once a week. The food was always delicious until recently, The last few months we've been eating a sub par food from this place  Always on special is there a general Tao chicken and rice   We ordered a chicken vegetable dish which was covered in a Strange see-through gravy  The dim sum The sticky fried rice is not made fresh it is frozen and microwaved as when we went in the middle of the rice we ate cold chicken gross!!  The waitress we had that night even though the place was not busy did not check in on her table or ask us how her food was:(  I'm not too sure what's going on there but they used to be really delicious now it seems it's  fast food Chinese restaurant put together really sloppily you can see there's no passion behind the food!  I hope they return to their original status of delicious food and good service so I can revise this review!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings! Definitely try their dumplings and friend rice  I had it for dinner and it tasted amazing."}
{"text":"I've had Mai Mai before but this visit was definitely my last!! Ordered the Cantonese beef chow mein expecting some crispy noodles at least. Noodles were overlooked and mushy and zero flavour. General Tso tasted exactly like sweet and sour sauce not general Tso whatsoever. And the chicken fried rice was extremely burnt and no flavour at all. Don't come here."}
{"text":"I give it a three star because I have a go to dish for me which is combination plate number 5 (beef and broccoli with chicken fried rice and egg roll), with $2 extra beef on top. I have this probably 2-3 times a week and it's very tasty and cheap (comes to $9.80 I think with extra beef, minus two obviously with out). Awesome portion also. The reason it doesn't get a full 4-5, is because the other dishes aren't up to par from what I've tried. Chicken balls are okay, but over battered, and the sweet and sour sauce is pretty much just a sweet sauce that's actually fairly bland. The wings are okay, and with honey garlic sauce, it's just a bland(ish) sweet sauce that doesn't fair well with the crunchy wings. Pad tai is so so, and I've had a few of the chefs specialties (with beef) and they were okay.   All in all, I would recommend this place to anybody still, but can be hit or miss, but the miss isn't too far off from being okay."}
{"text":"I liked the food here and everything tasted fresh, I ordered the house special fried rice and general toas chicken and shrimp rolls. All were good but I kept seeing almost everyone eating in getting the curry beef.. I'm going for that next time and oooh, I want to try the lemon chicken as well. Definitely coming back here again. I recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great. A little bit quiet at the restaurant but the staff is super nice and the food is delicious. The prices are great too. You get so much food for what you are paying."}
{"text":"I'll give it the passing grade of 2.5 Stars. The food itself is pretty plain, but the restaurant is impressively clean for its location - I mean finding a clean chinese restaurant is like finding a good Emilio Estevez movie."}
