{"text":"I had been waiting two weeks to try this place out and I was not disappointed. I called my order in advance since I live nowhere near the property. So when I came to pick it up it was ready. Took about 20 mins. I ordered the catfish dinner w/ Mac and cheese as a side. I didn't expect the Mac and Cheese to be so seasoned. In a good way! It was great! This fish was good too. No bones! Next time I'm going to try the red snapper (personal fave) and Peach Cobbler. I've seen articles that cobbler is what they are known for. And it's rare to find places that have fried Red Snapper."}
{"text":"This is soul food to feed your soul.  The pulled pork is moist and flavorful (and my new favorite).  The brisket is smoky and yummy.  But it's the southern sides that make me swoon.  The collard greens are maybe the best I've ever eaten (including my own cooking) and the Mac and cheese is a bowl full of cheesy yumminess.  

Tip: If you're eating in, just take a table; they do table service.  If you're ordering take out, go to the order window just inside the door.  Also keep in mind that it's not fast food.  Everything is prepared for you when it's ordered, so even to-go orders will take about 10 minutes to get ready.  Every minute is worth it.  You can shorten your wait time by calling in your order."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and reasonable pricing. My friend came over to hang out and we were hungry. Looked up some places we haven't been before in the area when we stumbled upon this place. Wanted to try it out and were not disappointed. Great vibe with a little soul and blues music playing. Friendly staff. Delicious food and koolaid. 
We had the three piece combo with Mac n cheese and an order of the 2 piece fish n chips.
Check it out!"}
{"text":"What a bummer. I placed an order on Grubhub to go and pick up and prepaid ~$40.  Ten minutes later, grubhub calls to say Stacy's has cancelled my order because they are \"too busy\".  The email from grubhub says I'll get my money back in 3-5 business days.  How wonderful.  If you aren't taking orders, don't take my money.  Jerks. I won't ever order from you again."}
{"text":"I had seen an article in the New Times about where to get the best fried chicken in Phoenix and Stacy's was on the very short list. I had it and it was amazing. I do have to say its the best chicken I have had in Phoenix.He also uses real okra to make his fried okra.It was delicious as well as the greens.My guy had catfish which was equally delicious. We will be back to try the barbecue! The music was great too."}
{"text":"I drove by this place a few times, so I finally thought to stop by tonight. Small quaint little place. Clean. Def had a good vibe inside. 

Busy inside. The guy who took my order was nice but distant  took my order and that was about it. 

I got the fried chicken. I got the white meat option. I got green beans and potatoes side. It was pretty good. Candied yams was delicious tho. 

However... The fried chicken was some of the plainest I've ever had. It was hot but not delicious. I thought maybe it was just my first bite. But it was just not good. 

Maybe I'll come back to try this place again as they had a lot more options than just fried chicken."}
{"text":"Always pass this place on a daily basis and finally had a chance to go eat there, I was craving some good soul food fried chicken, but was I mistaken, 1. it was really salty and it would have been worst if it didn't have salt, because it would have tasted so bland! 2. I ordered it with rice and gravy umm..gravy tasted like it came from a generic gravy can it was so bland and so disappointed.  I see someone else also had the same experience as I did on the chicken.  The fried okra was good and the kool-aid was good glad they didn't mess that one up.  Service was okay, the guy who took my order was like a robot though, you can tell he has no customer service, but he seems nice.   I would try this place again but won't order there chicken and rice/gravy again, I want to try the fish, but i'm afraid it would be bland and not fresh tasting,  but then again there's no such thing as fresh fish in arizona ;-)"}
{"text":"Great friendly service, delicious food, great chicken green beans, fish and rib tips will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Stacy is back and better than ever, definitely \"Off Da Hook\" Ribs, pork chops, catfish, it's all Bomb!!! Greens, mac and cheese, it's the real deal. Fresh and plentiful. Don't pass this \"Soul Food\" joint up!!!"}
{"text":"Good food... Only eaten there once, but was totally worth another future visit! Had the fried chicken, it was delicious 
Think I'll try their gumbo!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much in the outside but the fried chicken is on point and the bbq chicken was also very good. I had the collared greens and the mac and cheese both had a lot of flavor. I would come back."}
{"text":"Oh my. I am no stranger to amazing soul food... Stacy had aptly named his restaurant. The smothered pork chops are insane. The fried chicken, out of this world. But the catfish. Oh. Oh. My. Light, and perfect. The sides... The mac and cheese is exactly what you'd expect from southern cooking. The green beans and potatoes, delicious. My personal favorite was the cabbage. 
The peach cobbler was so good we ordered two more. And the 7-up cake was sweet and tasty. I cannot wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"Wonderful folks; wonderful sides; wonderful beverages. We sooo want to like these guys, but the meats they served were dry (we came around 7.30pm) and I haven't had worse brisket anywhere in this state. Same went for our cornbread muffins - all were all hard as rocks. 
I'm glad they're done hitting everything with Johnny's seasoning salt. Unfortunately, after years being a loyal customer, the changes we were hoping for still aren't happening. Please don't serve what you wouldn't serve to your family / friends."}
