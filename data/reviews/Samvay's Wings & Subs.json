{"text":"Small restaurant in a gas station. No fans so it does get hot in there. The prices are great! I got the pad Thai and it was awesome. My friend got the wings and the wings are actually really good!!!! The Asian zing sauce is definitely reallllyyyy spicy!"}
{"text":"What a surprise! Great food in a gas station! We had the Pho, pad Thai, wings  (teriayki), and chicken fried rice. Everything was really good!"}
{"text":"Food was really good.   Friendly staff. Clean location.  I read some of the reviews about being an old gas station.  SO what.  The food is good. And the staff was friendly.  And the owners were very grateful for our business.  We are always ready to support the smaller local businesses."}
{"text":"You would never guess by looking at the outside, but this former gas station turned convenience store has some excellent food. Everything I've tried has been delicious but by far my favorite is the Thai fried rice, the egg rolls and chicken wings. The rice is probably the best rice dish I've ever had. I've eaten many different rice dishes from a numerous places high and low and this is absolutely amazing. Egg rolls have a unique flavor and are not your same old boring egg rolls you get anywhere. Chicken Wings are crispy and fresh with great choice of sauces. And the prices are phenomenal! Do yourself a favor and go eat at Samvay's!"}
{"text":"Great place! Don't let the exterior fool ya! I think the most comparable analogy is to compare this to a neighborhood bodega. 

What I'm getting at is the food is amazing! The lemon pepper wings are rocking and any of the Thai food is worth the super-low price!

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Charlotte from Atlanta and started to miss the Vietnamese food of Buford Hwy. Then we found Samvay's! Their pad Thai is amazing and the best I have had. We got the pho tonight and it is the best pho we have found in Charlotte. The family who runs the place remembers you are and knows what you like. The food is made to order and is piping hot when we get home. Their wings and fries are phenomenal too. Their fried rice has non traditional ingredients but is so good! Don't judge the outside, get some Thai tea in the gas station, and place your order. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here tonight. And i think it is as close to authentic in this area that you're going to get. I had the chicken pad thai and it was just a little spice with ALOT of delicious flavor! Fresh ingredients. My husband had the chicken pho and it was like no other pho I've ever had! So yummy and the flavor just envelopes your mouth. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so impressed. I saw the ratings and was very excited even though the name didn't match the food haha. I got there and was(not going to lie) judging the place, but I've eaten in many hole in the wall places that turned out to be great. I'm so glad I gave this place a chance. I got the phad thai and my dad got the chicken fried rice. IT WAS SO GOOD. definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We almost left.  Glad we stayed. It seems to be a gas station Subway that has become a great Tai and Vietnamese lunch spot that does wings, burgers, and subs.  We had fresh and flavorful Pho and the Pad Tai was good. I thought the Pad Tai was a little sweet, but my wife loved it."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. I was initially a little worried about the place from the outside. Small town gas station with a restaurant inside. But the food WOWed me. Me and my girlfriend both got the Pad Thai, a spring roll, and a soda. The Pad Thai was very tasty, had a good ratio of meat/veggies/noodles, and ultimately was so much food I couldn't finish. 

Together, our total cost was $15. That's for two orders of Pad Thai, two Spring Rolls, and two sodas. That price is unbeatable. 

The staff was also very attentive and friendly. The waitress/cook checked on us throughout the meal and made the experience pretty great. 

I only had the Thai food, but this place also makes sub sandwiches and hot wings. I will definitely be back and will try those out next time."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is bomb! This place is a hidden treasure! I literally passed the place because it looked like an abandoned gas station. I'm so glad I didn't pass on this place."}
{"text":"Placed my order just before 7:00 on Saturday, they said it would be ready in 10 minutes, drove over 5 miles to pick it up, and they didn't even make it. This is my last time ordering from Samvay's."}
{"text":"They have fantastic Pho and Pad Thai!!! I love the Chicken on a stick too and their wings are huge - the 'Asian Zing Boom Boom' wings are very HOT but so tasty! My new favorite spot in Mount Holly for lunch or dinner - haven't tried their breakfast yet.  I can't wait for the Bahn Mi sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is inside of the convenient store down the street. Normally, I would never eat at a gas station, but when I saw the pictures of the Pad Thai and saw rave reviews about it on Facebook I couldn't resist trying it. It is excellent!!! Most items are American. Subs, BBQ, burgers, etc. My husband did not care for his burger but I keep going back for the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pad Thai and three eggrolls the food is amazing only thing I regret is that I didn't order more eggrolls the portion size with massive for the price I hope that they don't get too popular in the food quality goes down I'll definitely be back maybe even tonight for some more egg rolls. I only wish they used the broad traditional pad Thai noodles"}
{"text":"Four stars for inexpensive good tasting chow.   One star for decor and cleanliness.   If you can get past  eating in an old dirty gas station that has 24/7/365 Christmas decorations and mixed furniture from the 70's - you are golden.  Family run, good people.  TV had Kodi so you can catch a flick.   Interesting people watching, coming and going.    Good times, life is an adventure."}
{"text":"The outside of this place is a little sketchy, but once you get passed it (it has good reviews for a reason), the people and food is amazing. My friend ordered a Pad Thai, extra spicy, and the staff made jokes about how white people can't handle the heat. He asked for Asian spicy after that! I, being American, ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. They can do both American and Thai food really well. It's dirt cheap too. I highly recommend this place, never write reviews, and urge you to try it! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok, they say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover so I didn't. Based on the positive reviews I took a drive to this place to see what the hype was about. For starters it appears that it's not in the best of neighborhoods and it is attached to a convenience store where people are in and out buying everything from alcohol to lotto tickets. 

 I would absolutely give them 5 stars based on their friendliness and customer service but that's where it ends. I've had some authentic Thai food and this ain't it! The Pad Thai was extremely lumpy and had a strong undesirable aroma to it, almost like hot sauce. The fried rice was ok, but nothing to write home about. The lemon pepper wings were probably the best thing we had other than that I would definitely not return. 

It's pretty much gas station food."}
{"text":"DO NOT PASS UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY THIS PLACE! Just like other reviews, when we arrived, I was a little weirded out. It is attached to a gas station/convenience store but it seems like the family runs everything. 

I also was initially disappointed as we went on a Sunday, and I reaaallly wanted breakfast. The owner said he could make eggs and livermush, but that was about it. Not feeling those options, I ordered the chicken pho and I'm so glad that I did! It was made fresh with herbs that looked like they had been picked that morning. 

My husband order the Pad Thai, which was also a great choice. The prices were great, too. Our tab was $16, including drinks! This place is deceiving but worth trying for sure."}
{"text":"The gas station restaurant thing was a little questionable at first, but I saw so many good reviews I thought it was worth checking out. The pad Thai is crazy good. Literally the best pad Thai ever. Chicken on a stick also is amazing. The restaurant is family run and the people that own it are awesome. All in all a great little place to get a bite to eat. 

I highly suggest giving it a try! I think we all can agree we need more food options in MH."}
{"text":"Legit, Genuine Thai! Affordable and delicious!!! Don't be alarmed that it sits next to a convenient store. It's all run by a family. Food is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"The best pad Thai , pho, and fried rice anywhere.  Great Mom and Pop place.  Don't be put off by the appearance.  Health Grade is an A. I've never tried the wings, but they are on my bucket list."}
{"text":"CAN I GET MORE STARS TO RATE THIS PLACE?! WOW!! Incredible!! This might just be the literal definition of \"hole in the wall\". So far Ive tried 3 different flavor wings, Pad Thai, Fried rice, Egg rolls and the Pho. I honestly cannot decide which is best. They are all outstanding. Authentic, huge portions and unbeatable service and price!

This deserves all the stars in my book!"}
{"text":"I order the pad Thai with beef and lemon pepper wings. The wings were hot and delicious. The pad Thai was new to me but I enjoyed it. So much much, it's enough for 2 people. They have tables inside but I got my order to go. I'm so glad there are more business opening in Mt Holly. I look forward to trying the Pho next. They also sell American food burgers and fries pizza by the slice and also whole pizza. I will stop by for breakfast too to try their liver mush."}
{"text":"Omg food is delicious! Service is great and price is super reasonable definitely definitely a must try on the Asian zing wings."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken pad Thai! I will be bringing my whole family here in the future! This is for sure a special find."}
{"text":"I was looking for bahn mi when I ran across this hidden gem . No bahn mi , but the other items I've had are amazing . Don't let the fact that it's attached to a convenience store make you skip this treat . I've had the pho , the beef pad thai and the chicken skewers. Every item makes me want to go right back . Yesterday I ate an entire order of the pad Thai and got another order to go. That's how good it is . I highly recommend it for its Asian meals . Great prices but absolutely amazing flavor. You'll be happy you went in to try it ."}
{"text":"The Best Pad Thai I've had.  Don't let the outside fool you very clean insides and food is delicious. I would've never known about it if I hadn't seen recent reviews on yelp. But I have to agree this is my new spot for Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden treasure!!! Delicious and huge portions at an incredible price. Amazing pho, egg rolls, and the chicken fried rice, let me tell you, soooo good.  Now that we know about it and live right around the corner we will be coming regularly."}
{"text":"My first trip here was fantastic. I ordered the Beef Pad Thai and it was great, very delicious and fresh. Very pleased to have just moved down the street from this place. Can't wait to return. Samvay's is a place you have to try."}
{"text":"We found this place using Yelp, so Yelpers, take a bow!  

I agree with the funkiness of the place being in a gas station/convenience store, BUT, the food is awesome!  We have only had the Thai/Vietnamese food, and the wings.  

The beef Pho is excellent!  Having learned about Pho while living in Atlanta, and having tried different versions around the \"Buford Highway DMZ,\" this Mt Holly version is awesome!  Really good broth and noodles and shaved beef.  We will try the chicken version on our next visit.

The Pad Thai is very good too with a tasty spicy but not hot sauce.  Excellent version of the venerable dish.

The wings are money!  We have had a few different sauces, our favorite is their \"house\" sauce Boom Boom, very spicy and heat which builds...

Service is quick and very friendly, check em out!"}
{"text":"Little hidden gem in Mount Holly! Delicious barbecue, and excellent pho! Huge portion sizes, good prices, clean, and super nice owner. Will definitely make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Mount Holly's hidden gem this place is Pho-mazing. Homemade egg rolls great fried rice. It's always great to eat at a place where they put love into their food. DO NOT let the out word appearance fool you this place is great. Their Pho is so flavorful they will definitely be a regular place on my list. Beware of the hot sauce she said it was strong and she was right ."}
