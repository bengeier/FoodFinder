{"text":"Saturday night, only three other parties there when we arrived at what should have been prime time. Service was good but I guess that happens when there are no customers. Menu is sparse and they did not have two of the few menu items. My three meat combo featured dried out sausage, tasteless chicken and bland brisket. Sides were similar few to choose from and beans could have been out of a can and cole slaw was equally disappointing. Skip this place. From the look of things they won't last much longer anyway."}
{"text":"I tryed it when you first opened with my family and decided to come again to be fair a few months later. Atmosphere is important to start with. That music is depressing and sets the tone. The food was ok. Need more bbq sauce choices. The staff was kind and attentive but it feels like everyone has just been to a funeral and is trying too hard to be happy."}
{"text":"Great ribs and potato salad, Keaton was so informative about the restaurant and food. Homemade Ice cream on the way out is a must! Pretty laid back family place.Chek it out."}
{"text":"It was my familys first time eating here. The seating is alittle confusing.  The food was ok. There was a jalape√±o stem in my beans. The sauces are both sweet so its a choice of sweet and sweeter. And I didnt much care for the jerk chicken tho I believe it may be because im new to jerk chicken and thought it was suposed to be spicy. The brisket could use less rub and the macaroni and cheese was not creamy but rather dryer with melted cheddar on top. Dont get me wrong the place isnt horrible it just has alot of room for self improvement."}
{"text":"We had been waiting for a long time for this place to open. Visited and was extremely disappointed with the food. My husband and kids ordered the ribs and I ordered the 3 meat sampler. The ribs were extremely tough. They didn't have a good flavor at all. They were out of coleslaw, which is a staple with BBQ. On the 3 meat I had the brisket, smoked chicken and pulled pork. The chicken was very dry with little to no flavor. The pulled pork was just a wet mass on the plate. The brisket was decent with the only draw back was it had way to much pepper for my liking. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Like many others, I was skeptical to try Red River because it always looks so desolate. But much to my surprise, the brisket I ordered was delicious! The rub was so flavorful and the meat was very tender. I also had a taste of a friend's ribs that just fell of the bone and were also so yum!! Only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because the sides were very average. Corn on the cob had nothing on it and mac n cheese wasn't exciting. This place would be great for a large group and I definitely plan on going back! I hope more people give it a try as I would hate to see it close.   PS - I'm from Texas if that gives me more authority"}
{"text":"What a great find!!! Wonderful Texas-style barbecue. Friendly, attentive servers in a cafeteria-style restaurant. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went there 4 times.  First 2, the meat was great. It really was. Dry rub was superb.  Their sauces were SUBPAR at best and tasted \"off\".  I, like another who commented here observed \"nervous servers\".   3rd visit, A bit dry.  On the fourth visit, we brought a friend we have not seen for years there from out of town.  WHAT GARBAGE. Fatty, Grizzle filled ribs. It was as if they cooked the leftover trashmeat from trimming.   SOOoo embarrassed, especially since our friend treated.  NEVER, will any of us EVER go back.  This place needs to D I E and the sooner, the better.  I guess I should have known.   RARELY will you see a car in the parking lot and if you do, it will be... ONE car.  MAYBE two.    REALLY.  Compare that to any decent place and YOU will quickly realize the bell is tolling.  TG's comment:  \"9/1/2017  Hats off to you for living the Golden Rule, using the internet for good instead of evil turning the other cheek.  We have no problem making or remaking any item that you're not satisfied with. I have a childlike trust in the honesty of all my guests so do not mind remaking an item.\"  WD:  How about NOT serving garbage to begin with?  It wasn't slightly off, it was OBVIOUSLY, To a blind man, off.  \"Could extend an olive branch to you and invite you back for organic Pizza. We grow all the ingredients for the pizza on site, the flavor of organic ingredients is far superior. We are all just vessels here from the deity above Jesus loves you\"  WD: Yes we are. Yes, He does.  THAT has no bearing whatsoever on the issue at hand.         Pizza at a BBQ place?   No, I think I'll pass on that too.  TG's response:  \"you seem like somebody who wouldn't be happy in an ice cream parlor a pizza parlor a barbecue restaurant or a full-on bar which we have all those at the restaurant. My suggestion to you is to stay home have a Coke and a smile thanks for coming out. God Bless America For the Love of Texas and Jesus loves you\"  And mine:  Jesus love me, And you...  But probably not your food so much. Funny how you can predict MY happiness for Ice Cream, Pizza, A Bar, AND BBQ! Wow!  Now some advise for YOU.   You cannot be all things to all people AND do them ALL well.  Either be a BBQ, A pizza shop, or whatever.  IN-N-OUT Burger understands THAT premise quite well.   As for the rest of us, read the reviews, make your own conclusions.  All one has to do is to use their OWN eyes to see the amount of traffic you do.  THAT my friend speaks volumes.  I said my piece.  You'll not salvage me or my friends.  Others will go there, they will make their own conclusions. After which they will agree or disagree with MY assessment. Yelp exists to comment on various restaurants.  I did and I did it honestly as experienced first hand. YOU making remarks regarding Jesus, MY preferences in food establishments, and using a \"Ad Hominem\" logical fallacy with your \"Hats off to you for living the Golden Rule...\" will NOT change a thing except make people see your manipulation for what it is.  QUIT while you're ahead.  And TG's response: 9/18/2017  Hey Wayne I changed my mind on behalf of St Michael San Gabriel and all the other archangels in heaven I like to tell you to go fyourself. Yeah Wayne reaching to your freezer there at your house your pathetic life and house reaching their pull out your TV dinner and Chip your teeth on a frozen dick all right?....  MORE VULGAR CHILDISH STATEMENTS.  WOW, W O W!  THANK YOU for making my point TG!  REALLY!  You just couldn't leave it alone.  Now EVERYONE will see you for exactly what you are.  As I said.... THIS PLACE NEEDS TO DIE  A.S.A.P. and I believe your response WILL hasten it.  More \"Ad Hominem\" logical fallacies galore.  Your attempts to goad me tickles me actually.  R.I.P.   If I could give ZERO stars, you would have them.  You've certainly earned it.  You said: \"I don't give a flying f*** what you got to say\"  THAT is obviously untrue or you would have shut your mouth.  No, You're upset that people are READING my review,  AGREEING AND VOTING POSITIVELY for it.  Not because I lied or was malicious.  I simply stated MY OPINION based on MY REAL experience there.  You however, have shown your absolute inability to TRULY conduct yourself in a professional manner.  I'm afraid if you do not stop, YOU will bury your own business, if you haven't done so already.  You said  \"I lack class\"  Definition: \"CLASS\" - showing stylish excellence. \"he's a class player\" synonyms:  classy, decent, gracious, respectable, noble \"a class player\"  I believe (I) have EASILY shown that I have \"Class\".  You?  I'll leave that for the readers to decide. ~FINI~  You responded... AGAIN?  I'll ignore you from here on. I've run out of space.  You're already dangling... Oh, and BTW, I was just at a QUALITY restaurant talking to a lady who \"WAS\" going to try u.  Keyword: WAS  ;-)  BAZINGA!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is underwhelming. I had the three meat sampler. I had the Jerk Chicken, Beef Brisket, and Pulled Pork. It came out luke warm. The taste was just average. The skin on the Jerk Chicken skin had so much rub I could not have the skin and it was dry. The brisket did not have enough bark or a decent smoke ring. The food was just  average but overpriced. The service was good. No problems there."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place since it was so close to our house. When you walk in you directed to the front counter where you order your food and pay cafeteria style. Then when your food is ready they bring your food to the table. We ordered the pulled pork, the ribs and brisket with a side of beans and a side of coleslaw.  They have a large well lit dining room with tables and booths.  Our food came in about five minutes.  They do not use plates but as many barbecue places do today put your food on paper on the tray.  The pulled pork was flavorful but a little dry. The ribs and brisket we're good but nothing remarkable. The beans were definitely cowboy beans with a smoky barbecue flavor and the coleslaw was creamy.  They also have a full bar which has a small seating area. We ordered a beer and a mixed drink,  the bartender was friendly and made a good drink. All in all this seems like a good place to go for a family dinner."}
{"text":"If yelp had a minus rating Red River BBQ would get it. The food was awful except the ribs. It was all served \"room temperate\" if the room was 40 degrees. The brisket was 75% fat, coleslaw was not edible and the cornbread was right out of the freezer.   The owner was rude and was actually argumentative with my boyfriend when he asked about French fries. Then made a comment about how us Arizonans don't know what real BBQ is. Who says that to a customer if you want them to return.  So DONT waste your money or your time if you don't want to be served cold food and be insulted."}
{"text":"Food was good, not exceptional-my only complaint was the meat was a little dry but the BBQ sauce provided helped a lot. I LOVE the atmosphere and decor and it's cafeteria style which gives it a more fast food feel. Kid friendly-big plus! Overall I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Found out about this restaurant from my sister and brother-in-law. We had dinner and had a trip meat sampler. The pork ribs were very flavorful and jucey. The came out quickly and as ordered. If you like a great bbq come out and try this place out soon. Word is going to get quickly about how good this place is."}
{"text":"Great food, helpful staff, A+ Texas BBQ!  I'm definitely coming back with friends next time :)   I had the pulled pork sandwich and some ribs, more than enough to share with two, three people! Food was delicious, I want to try more!   Food 9/10 Staff 8/10 Experience 9/10  Long live Texas BBQ!"}
{"text":"Well I didn't eat here and now I never will. I was passing by and thought it looked interesting, but the parking lot was empty it was around 2pm so I pulled in to the parking lot to get the hours. When I pulled up in front of the restaurant and got out of my car to read the hours on the door, a dirty older gentleman approached me and said \"you can't leave your car there your blocking the driveway\" which I wasn't and again the parking lot was completely empty except for his beat up old truck. I advised him I was just checking the hours and again even more rude than the first time said ok but you can't leave your car there anyway, instead of just telling me the hours. I asked if it was his restaurant and he told me yes it is,  I told him there was no reason to be rude and he just stared me down like he wanted to fight me. Not sure if he's actually the owner of the establishment or just a handyman on a power Trip but either way I will never give this establishment a dime of my money and I hope this review detours others as well. Any owner of a hospitality business should have hospitality or go into another business."}
{"text":"I know in my earlier review I'd said I would go back, but since they've instituted a \"no refund\" policy, I've decided not to. I don't know of many (any?) other restaurants who refuse to refund your money if they don't provide a satisfactory meal. Any restaurant that is that concerned with the impact of refunds on their bottom line is worth avoiding. There are plenty of other places to eat."}
{"text":"Best bbq ever..enjoyed owner & chef being so friendly..  RIBS juicy & meaty with homemade sauce on table. The cowboy beans were terrific with bits of brisket mixed in.all sides especially Cole Slaw very tasty..pecan pie topped off a great meal..NOT TO SWEET..... $REASONABLE..GOING BACK TO TRY CHIX.."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try this place since it was new. It was very disorganized, I ordered a baked potato with butter and sour cream, it took 15 minutes before it was brought to our table, then it had slabs of meat on it. I asked for one with just butter and sour cream, my husband was completely finished with his food, still no potato. I asked for a refund as we had already payed $5.99 for a potato I did not get. They said they do not do refunds, I asked for the manager, he was rude and flip and we left very unsatisfied and will never go back. The ribs were tough and so disorganized his food was cold and mine never came."}
{"text":"I love this new restaurant, delicious bbq. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and had great food. Personally would recommend the pulled pork, smoked turkey and potato salad! Homemade BBQ sauce is phenomenal too!Owner Jim was really nice and answered all our questions about his process. Would definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We gave it another shot this past summer and nothing had really changed. Poor taste, low quality, mediocre service. Wait staff seemed in a perpetual state of nervousness. My own experience in the food and service industry point to one of two things. Either the turn over rate is so high that no on really knows what they are doing because no one stayed long enough to gain the experience, or the manager / owner was a complete tyrant and employees were in a constant state of fear.  From reading the replies to reviews it really makes you wonder. Not surprised it finally closed, just wonder what took so long.  The owners reply today (9/18/2017) speaks for itself... and an additional one that doesn't display, pasted below for your viewing pleasure. Please join me in wishing him the best of luck in his next venture. It's obvious he needs all the help he can get.  \"T G.'s comment on your review: I have the right to refuse service and not sell you a tinker's damn so what the f*** you got to say about that?

{"text":"I don't often comment on My yelp review, my husband is more of the yelp user. We eat out 2-3times a day and take to reviews to try new restaurants. We have been waiting for this restaurant to open for quite some time. We love to support privately owned restaurants in our community and were very excited Red River was  opening up. Well.... We read the reviews and thought they were a bit harsh considering they had just opened and quirks are inevitable so we gave it a try despite the negative reviews. Well.... Wished we would't have. Not because of the fact we were not impressed. Not the fact it was nothing we expected. Not the fact others had the same consensus of the restaurant but because of the OWNER. He will be his own business demise. NO DOUBT!  My husband gave a simple review commenting Dickies up the street was better considering our current experience. Even tho were not impressed, it was in our list  of \" give it another try\" list.   NOT ANYMORE! We got this message from the owner! READ BELOW;  We produce an all-natural product \"Kaylee J\" So if you don't know the difference btwn scratch cooking & frozen pre-packaged, corporate food, head on down the road. Your obviously a competitor,  We offer the community, a fun family-friendly, community friendly environment,  in a clean,safe place to dine, in a farm-fresh shin-dig.  We will be showcasing live music to follow...  & finger painting for children & adults.... I would invite you back, for homemade pie, however you wrote a negative review last week and you wrote one this week on Sunday.  We operate a friendly friendly environment, as a friend I suggest that you stay home play knick knack paddy whack with yourself and hit the drive-thru.\"  !!!!!! Yelp is to allow consumers post their experience as to allow other consumers make an informed decision wether they would like to give it a try or not. This response from the owner because he was unsatisfied of the review was completely uncalled for and shows a character of someone I would never support or endorse. Read the reviews and decide for yourself if this is a restaurant you want to support."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Red River.  This time I came to try the organic pizza.  It was great!  Possibly the best BBQ chicken pizza you will ever have.  Fresh, high-quality ingredients really make a difference.  The smoked chicken is melt-in-your-mouth tender and flavorful.  The sauce is a perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  Crust was fresh and perfect.  Not too thin as to get soggy but no too thick as to overwhelm the pizza.   The BBQ on my first visit was very good, but the pizza is over-the-top!"}
{"text":"Ordered Brisket sandwich Fri evening. We inquired about the prime rib. They seemed to think they would have a run on it so they suggested we make a reservation.We came in on Sunday and ordered the prime rib. It comes with NO Sides. My husband ordered corn on the cob (1/4 of an ear for $2.00 and no butter) and we both had cole slaw. $32.00 They served the meat on a metal tray covered with brown wrapping paper which tore when we tried to cut the.meat. The meat was under cooked and luke-warm, and they only have plastic utensils. The plastic knife would not cut the meat. So we packed up the food to go, took it home, reheated the meat, ate it on plate with silverware, like human beings. It seems like the owner spent a lot on decor and cheaped out on everything else.  The place was being run by teenagers who could not care less. The cole slaw is in a refrigerator in syrofoam cups behind the ordering line. They don't have a dish to save their lives, and they admitted to not having any silverware at all. Stick with the sandwiches. My husband says it was the worst prime rib he ever had. They gave me the end piece, hiding the end underneath. The meat was half fat and disgusting. We were very disappointed. Two stars is us being generous."}
{"text":"I think the place is now closed and out of business.....gates to the parking lot closed since I first checked Sunday (9/10) afternoon. Too bad, that could have been a nice destination for our area but it seems that customers often not treated right. Hope new management will take over."}
{"text":"Wow...just wow...my husband and I ordered the 3 meats sampler and were blown away. The meat is so well seasoned and crazy tender. It doesn't need sauce, but if you're going to add it, the BBQ sauce on the table is freaking fantastic. So good I immediately called my parents to let them know. We will absolutely be coming back and will be bringing people with us. The only area for improvement would be the hours of operation, they close at 9pm. We would have tried it sooner if it were open until 10pm or 11pm, even if it's just Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"We attempted to try this place last night. Atmosphere was lacking in my opinion, maybe needs some music.... and i took my daughter to the restroom and oh boy! Sewer problem!!  And a sign in there that referred to bad yelp reviews... who put that in there?  So then,  we tried to order...my husband had to repeat our order 3x, not kidding,  the young man behind the counter just couldn't focus... too much noise back there,  i don't know... then an older man corrected the young man that corn cost more as a side item (the menu wasn't clear on that), no kids options.. so we thought we'll order the sausage.. but they were out... that was enough.. it just kept getting worse...we left without eating."}
{"text":"Beware of the owner- he treats his customers like garbage.  The servers and other staff were wonderful, and it is sad for them that one of the owners is likely going to sink this ship! Our first experience at Red River BBQ was good. Food was good, service was nice, the booth was a little dirty but we didn't mind too much. Our second experience was a DISASTER! My husband and I each grabbed a beer from the ice display.  Unfortunately the top half of the beer that was not submerged in ice was very warm.  We asked the server for help with this who kindly brought frosty glasses.  I was ok with that, my beer was not super cold but tolerable.  My husband's beer was still very warm and not drinkable.  We asked the server for a different beer and she went to go see what she could do.  One of the owners came to our table, grabbed my husband's beer and said it was cold.  My husband replied politely that it really wasn't cold at all.  The owner said that this was the temperature that they kept their beers at their restaurant and maybe at our home we kept them at a different temperature.  My husband said ok no problem, I don't want this beer.  The owner took the beer and walked into the kitchen, where he proceeded to talk poorly about my husband and called him an asshole so loud that everyone in the restaurant heard it.  We were shocked and did not want our two young daughters to be exposed to this behavior.  At that point we grabbed our children, our receipt and politely asked for a refund and said we would not be eating because the owner just called my husband an asshole.  The women helping us were very apologetic but there was nothing they could do because the owner forbid them to help us.  Another customer spoke up on our behalf and said that how the owner was treating us was wrong.  He said that he heard him call my husband an a-hole- that the whole restaurant could hear him.  We left and stayed in the parking lot calling my bank to dispute the charges and right when we were getting ready to leave, the owner came out and handed us a refunded receipt with no apologies or other words spoken.    We are really bummed because the staff was nice and the food was good, but we cannot support an establishment that has an owner who treats his customers with so much disrespect.  My advice, the staff should look for jobs elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fun concept and amazing BBQ + organic pizza!! Quick service and the portions are a good size. Family friendly but also good for date night :)"}
{"text":"Honestly was kinda skeptical about this place but the brisket....its amazing! And for being brand new they were such kind people. You can tell they have a few hiccups but they have been open for 1.5 weeks. Got to talking to the cook and he explained his cooking process and it was just an all around great experience!! Order at the counter and pick a spot and enjoy the amazing BBQ."}
{"text":"Mac n cheese was good. They were out of ribs and chicken....what BBQ place runs out of ribs? I had the Ranchmans sandwhich. It was ok. My husband ordered brisket...and that is all that came on his plate he had to order sides separately, Mac n cheese and potato salad $2 each. Should have know as place was nearly empty....Poor management.  Would never go back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money at this place. I also read the reviews & tried to give it a chance. The meat sandwiches are just meat & bread only with their logo burnt into the bread. The meat was very dry. The loaded baked potato was not too bad. No direction, no greeting, just staff that didn't know what was going on. 2nd trip was today. Ordered the loaded baked potato again, to go. Got home, & found out that I just paid $9 for a plain potato with little to none brisket on it. That was it. It was not loaded or what I ordered so I called to speak to a manager. I heard the man that answered tell whoever that this lady wants to speak to a manager, he repeated it & then hung up on me, on purpose Cuz when I called back, same thing happened.  Then I get a reply from the supposed manager. Talk about lies! Lol and southern hospitality? You're kidding me. More like lack of. I'm was not trying to sink your restaurant you fool, and like you wrote, a free world so my review was the truth & advising people not to waste their time with your rudeness. Now, have a nice day and no, I will never be back and will continue to share my experience and show people your comment back to me."}
{"text":"Had the smoked turkey and side salad. Great! The restaurant just opened. Nice staff. A good selection of BBQ."}
{"text":"Went to try this place out with my wife since it is in the neighborhood. The place was empty to start with, ok no problem. We were informed it was a Cafeteria style BBQ place, far from it. I tried the 3 meat sampler (no ribs included) got jerk chicken very soft, not spices. Brisket, very Dry, and hot links, not hot. My wife tried the 2 meat sandwich minus the bread ( yes they did serve it on a bun, although the order taker was told no bread. Her turkey and chicken were as follows turkey was great, chicken bland.  The couple behind us ordered the same sandwich as my wife and guess what she actually got her sandwich with no BREAD.  The good part was the potato salad w/dill tasted really great.  The Cole slaw was marginal.  The staff was very nice. We both agreed that no matter what ever restaurant is placed there we will Not go.  The place must have a curse, this is the 4th restaurant there. That makes 2 Chinese places, one Mexican buffet, and now one BBQ place. All in all we were not impressed by this place. Please check it out for yourself....your tastes may be different....."}
{"text":"Hoping the food and service would be better but maybe they are working out the kinks. The beef brisket was dry so i didn't finish it. My turkey and baby back ribs were good. The mac n cheese was good, not the best I've had but decent. I had to ask for another jalape√±o cornbread muffin because my first one was hard at the bottom. Lemonade was good. I liked that it was full of sugar like some places make lemonade. A few suggestions...a manager needs to walk around the tables and check on the customers. After our food was bought to our table no one checked on us and we had to flag down a server for a food to go container. Offer butter for the cornbread. Place the tea and lemonade containers up higher so you can fill your cup up all the way. Lastly, your staff should thank your customers as they leave. I plan on coming back to give this place another shot to see if the food and service has improved. The restaurant itself is beautiful with an outstanding patio area. If you are on the fence about this place i think it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Just had brisket sandwich and corn bread for lunch , best bbq I've had . We will be back ."}
{"text":"If you like BBQ go elsewhere. First of all Flavor is avoided at all costs, the prime rib (which was about about about the size of a fist for $14) tasted like it was sitting all day, the Mac and Cheese was worst than a box of store brand mac. The pulled pork on the potato was dry and the potato skin was not salted or seasoned in any way. Their BBQ sauces (Sweet or Spicy) were watered down and just tasted off. No S&P on the table you have to go get packets. Not going back there again."}
{"text":"Walked in on cinco de mayo based on an ad on the radio.  Pretty dead and they ran out of the cinco de mayo special.   The kids were pretty confused about the whole situation.  We walked out and went elsewhere.  They couldn't explain the substitutions or really anything.  I thought maybe they had literally just opened but I guess not."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place bc we love good BBQ & it's close to my house. Unfortunately, I'm not in a hurry to go back unless I hear they've made some positive changes.   We ordered a half rack of baby back ribs, and a sampler plate of pulled pork, brisket and the regular sausage; sides were baked beans and mac & cheese. The pulled pork was pretty good, and my husband and I agreed that it shows the owner/cook has an idea of what they're doing; the mac and cheese was also decent. Everything else was underwhelming. The ribs needed a solid 2-3 more hours in the smoker (they didn't come off the bone easily and were very dry). The brisket was dry without much flavor. The sausage had good seasoning, but something was definitely missing.   I would have appreciated if there were jalape√±o peppers to eat with the meat (like at some of my favorite BBQ restaurants), but they didn't have any; a couple pickles, apple slices, and some onions were placed on the plate. A young worker took good initiative and came over to get our feedback, but I don't think he was comfortable responding to negative - but constructive - feedback.    Knowing that this place recently opened up - and that it's a new smoker - my husband and I will probably give this place another chance in a few months. Hopefully they'll have their stuff together at that point - and won't need to hang the sign encouraging (bribing) people to leave a positive review bc \"Yelp hates us.\""}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday evening, wasn't too busy, The future missus and I were really eager to check this place out.  The order style is cafeteria style so you go up to the order area and then you pay and sit down and wait for your order, so far so good.  We get our drinks and sit down and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait.  People who came in after us are getting our food. 45 minutes later we go ask someone what's going on, turns out they had no record of us being there, no order, no nothing, except for the fact we just paid them.  So older woman, possibly asst. manager or whatnot apologizes profusely and says she'll get it right out. 15 minutes later she comes back to check on us, and sees we still don't have food, she's flustered and says the order-taker swore she had our food delivered to us.  We just want to leave at this point and get our money back. We find out there's a no refund policy even if the staff made the mistake -- and not giving a paying customer food is a pretty big one I'd say.  So she plies us with free dessert, we say, \"fine,\" just so we can leave.  We get our food and leave.  The lady wanted to let us know that we shouldn't judge the place by this instance.  Well, dear, first impressions are huge, and this was arguably the worst first impression I've had at a restaurant.  On to the food. We both got the pulled pork sandwich.  The sandwich wasn't bad, but certainly wasn't anything to write home about.  The jalapeno sriracha BBQ sauce is probably the only highlight as it was tangy and didn't have that sriracha-y taste I don't like.  The pecan pie dessert I had was bad, the pie filling is supposed to be nutty and sweet, this tasted no better than the saran wrap that covered the thing on the way home.  We ordered potato salad and jalapeno cornbread sides, but we can't critique those seeing as we didn't get them like we're supposed to.  We did get their cowboy beans and mac and cheese instead.  I didn't try the beans, but according to my future wife they were pretty disgusting.  The mac and cheese I did try and it was maybe a step or two above making a box of it at home.  The only positive in this experience is the staff seemed nice and friendly.  However, that's not enough, we won't be coming back, the impression that no one really checked on us until we had to complain not once, but twice, and then the manager or whoever she was saying that waitstaff lied about getting our food to us is a bridge to far. If you do try this place, the food isn't terrible (minus the beans, supposedly) it's just nothing to write home about, just make sure you actually get your food when you order it.  Edit: 9/19/17 I received a private message from the owner that read \"Whoop dee freaking doo tubby! You strike me as an all-you-can-eat kind of guy those kind of restaurants are up the street.\"  Really shows the effort this owner makes in customer service."}
{"text":"I'm really not one to rely on reviews before going to any place unless I had my own experience and this place was pretty good. The macaroni and cheese was great especially with their BBQ sauce. Their desserts are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ we've had in a very long time. Great Western feel and ambience. Food is delicious. All the meats are smoked with pecan wood and fresh ingredients used everyday. They also use a lot of organic ingredients  and have their own garden .  My kids ordered organic pizza and loved it. The service was warm and friendly and the staff are very helpful. I will definitely be bringing my family here again and again. I can't believe this is the first time I've been here since they opened eight months ago. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves great western style BBQ."}
{"text":"I, like other reviewers, really wanted to like this place. Close, local/non-chain, sounded great! We were there on the first Friday they were open. We got there during the dinner rush and waited in the line for the service area for 40 minutes. There were 6 parties before us. When we got up to order, they were out of pulled pork, corn on the cob, and didn't have the fruit salad that was on the menu board. The brisket was tasty, but half of our portion was fat. Not fatty meat, all fat. The turkey was good. The jalapeno sausage was inedible. It was grainy and crumbled when you went to pick it up. The cowboy beans were underdone but flavorful, and the macaroni and cheese tasted like cafeteria Velveeta Mac. No one came by to check on us, and when we asked for the cookie that comes with the kids meal, we were told they were out and no one could go to the counter in the front to help us. When we left, there were cookies in the display case. A not-happy 3 yr old = not happy parents. It took this place forever to open, but if tonight was any indication, it won't take long for it to close."}
{"text":"I think they should re-open an do things a little different.  I was in there once before they closed an it was ok to me.  They might flavor up the sides and the sauce. I think the opinions of some of the customers was a little bit hatefull, and i think the owner really got pissed off and said things he shouldnt have said  but havent we all. This resturant has had so many diferent things in it and they all failed, I never understood that. As popular as panchos is they even went under. If they could re-open and have less items and stick to one thing like just BBQ, that might work."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  This place is a mess and is straight out of a restaurant comedy movie.... Food is worse than below average and some is inedible, if you can even get it.  They were out of pulled pork, corn, and baked potatoes when we were there at 6 pm on a friday.  Took at least 40 minutes to get our food, with a handful of people in line.  Brisket was fatty, sausages were inedible, chicken was cold.  Ribs were the best thing and I would give those a 3/10, also, i think their bbq sauce is ketchup so that ruined the ribs anyway.  Lastly they were out of pulled pork so couldn't say but I'm sure that sucks too.   I don't think they have a kitchen manager, no one knew anything.  I feel sorry for the kids working here.  The owner, is a total ahole.  We walked in and immediately, out of the blue, he told our 3 year old he could have some ice cream (we don't really do dessert for him at night so a bit frustrating).  Then he proceeded to explain how this is Texas style dining, whatever that means, and if you want to sit down to order your food go to an Italian restaurant.   Basically repeating what others have reported, if you don't like it, get out.  I then ran into him again, looking for that ice cream cone.  Tracked him down in the back at a table talking to a friend.  The gist of the conversation was \"these people are idiots and they don't know what real bbq is anyway\".  After I interrupted, he reluctantly, got my kid an ice cream....it was horrible too btw.  I wanted to give them some credit till I had another exchange w this guy.  Go back to texas, Tex, with your cafeteria style bbq (I hope he reads this btw but somehow doubt his yelp awareness....maybe they don't have that in texas)  As we were leaving the owner was smoking out front, right by the door, talking to some more \"friends\".  There were probably 20 people inside waiting in line waiting over an hour to order their food.  Nice job buddy.  Your bbq bbq might be good (it wasnt btw) but no one can get anything cuz you keep running out of food and you don't have a real kitchen staff.  This place is doomed. Gonna be closed in 2 months.   Seriously, I cannot stress this enough....do NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"My boyfriend recently noticed this place when he was visiting and wanted to give it a try. I never really had an interest in it before because there are never any cars in the parking lot and I didn't know it had opened yet. When we tried it there were only 2 other tables of people there. We ordered at the counter- brisket, pulled pork, and jalape√±o sausage with mac & cheese on the side and sat down in a booth. The smell of the building reminded me of the stale, musty smell of my grandpa's apartment- Not overly appetizing. Our food arrived and we were eager to start. That feeling didn't last long though. The brisket, which to me should always be a barbecue restaurant's best dish, was tough, dry, and cold. It probably wasn't made that day but I should have known better since this place seems to hardly get any customers. The pulled pork had good texture but was so salty it was hard to swallow. The jalape√±o sausage was tasty with a surprising amount of heat but it was overall comparable to a store bough sausage. The mac and cheese was also a little salty but the texture of the sauce was good. Overall, I ended up eating most of that with only a few bites of meat. I probably wont be back. I'll stick to Naked BBQ since they're only a little farther down the road and have extremely better quality of food."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try red river BBQ out tonight because it is close to our home and it just opened a couple weeks ago. So when we walked in the door the girl at the front said\" welcome to Red Robin, oops I mean red river BBQ\". Well I wished we would have gone to Red Robin because red river BBQ is the worst BBQ we have ever eaten in all of Phoenix!! Do not waste your time or money here!! The food was horrible, we were asked if everything was good and my wife said she doesn't like her chicken the guy goes you should put sauce on it. Well BBQ sauce on jerk chicken that tasted like an ash tray since the smoke was so strong doesn't really go. We will put this on our list of places not to go back to. The McDonald's drive through food was better."}
{"text":"We LOVE BBQ! After waiting and watching for months we had the opportunity to eat lunch on 1/23/17.   You order, pay, get a number and the food is delivered to the table. Silverware is plastic.  Overall VERY disappointing and over priced.   We ordered a combo meal which was supposed to come with 3 meats each 1/4 pound. We chose pulled pork, brisket and hot sausage. The pulled pork was probably 1/4 pound but the other two WAY light. Ordering corn bread consumed the one included side. We ordered a second side... the recommended beans. The container of beans was incredibly tiny.   The woman at the cash register should not be interacting with customers. She was rude and somewhat snobish.   There are two BBQ sauces. The mild has better flavor.   They have a nice looking bar that diea not open until 3pm.   We won't be back unless things change."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. This place is horrible! The sign at the register that they won't issue refunds was the first red flag. The rancid potato salad smelled of mold and was Luke warm. I literally spat it out. All our meat was dry and cold. Nothing was at proper temp and they are NOT serving food safely. County Health should shut them down. Manager was horribly rude and demanded that we leave because we complained about the food's safety. Overpriced and there went $35 down the drain. I will be filing a complaint to the health department as well."}
{"text":"This place should be on kitchen nightmares. The corn Bread was not corn bread, the brisket was all fat, and everything was cold. Not to mention how dirty literally everything was in this place. Took a few bites and we got up and asked for a refund when the manager said no an started cursing at us in the middle of the restaurant very loudly. Real disappointed after waiting so long for this place to open. No doubt this place is going to closed soon."}
{"text":"Way over priced and the flavor was cooked out of the food. $11 for a sandwich, side and drink, that you could get at Arbys for $6. and i think Arbys is terrible. You need a good $5 lunch , sandwich , fresh side and drink. GOOD LUCK"}
{"text":"Brisket was fantastic! Very good. Sides werent as good. It's a new restaurant and they definitely still have some kinks to work out but hopefully they will."}
{"text":"Had an awful experience at this restaurant. Ribs were super dry and tasteless. Sauce was not good at all. Potato salad was going bad. What a waste of time and money. I understood that this owner has a no refund policy, so I didn't bother to waste my time with it, just chalked it off to a terrible decision. I should have read the reviews before I visited this location. The staff was friendly and apologetic but there must be some issue with the owner/manager. Oh well, we will do better next time."}
{"text":"To Ethan, if that is your real name, I have no affiliation with pork on a fork. They are the best BBQ in Phoenix, not just in my opinion but many others as well. The reason I only have one review is because I never used yelp in the past and your food sucked enough for me to take the time to creat an account to post about how terrible of an experience I had in your establishment. Thanks for trying to save face on this one but this is a 100 percent legitimate response by someone who had a terrible experience when coming here. In addition, if you scroll through the reviews a lady posted a picture in her review and my family and I just happen to be in the background. I have uploaded a profile picture on here as well so you can see the legitimacy of both of these posts and how you are making yourself look like more of an idiot. This place is going to be the next ABC (Amy's baking company, google it if you don't remember them...). From the reviews and interactions you are headed down that same road and will be closed in the next 6 months. Good luck to you."}
{"text":"We stopped on Friday night for BBQ and pizzas. The food and servIce were great. I sure hope this place lasts! I would particularly like to mention Brenda, the cashier and so much more than that. She is a really excellent asset to the business."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, the restaurant is beautiful.. the meat is cooked to perfection, all the MEAT is fantastic. My only complaint will be to please re -make the sides. They are bland and sad. If it's getting expensive please just offer fresh bread and corn. The sides really need love. My 15 year old makes a better Mac and cheese and it's Kraft.   I love this place and want to come back but just for the amazing space and meat.. no more sides ever for me. Please re think and taste. You will be fantastic when you realize this small but important must upgrade.."}
{"text":"I am with Todd, beating these guys up so early in the game just isnt fair. They have built a really cool restaurant and are serving a better plate then they are given credit for. Those of you giving such poor reviews should be ashamed of yourselves for picking on folks while they are still getting their feet under them.  Thee meat plater, pulled pork, hot links, briskit and coleslaw.  The BBQ sauce is the best. Both are fantastic.  Coleslaw is friggin perfect.  The pork, briskit and sausage were great, cant believe the price, best value in town for bbq by far.  Serving staff were more than polite, great people. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Waited a long time for them to open.  Food was decent.  Turkey and pulled pork were excellent."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Head up the road to Dickeys or honestly anywhere that has a clue on how to run a restaurant or how to cook! I allowed for one star only because the macaroni and cheese and my Dr. Pepper were very good.  No signage in entryway to direct the customer to step to the right and hen up to the counter to order. But lots of staff members that looked like a deer in the headlights when I asked if we seat ourselves or what was up.   Several other customers did this same thing, only one set was treated nicely and given the proper greeting since the staff was busy chatting with each other.  And they are proud of their beer prices!! $6 for a pint of Coors light is a bit too high of a mark up. When I asked the cashier to double check the price (which I think was also the manager) she was proud to say that was correct and report that they are $5 for their happy hour.  Yeah, no thanks!!  We ordered a pepperoni pizza, told it was going to be 20 minutes since they are made fresh. Super we had though! The crust was burnt to a crisp!! They did offer to remake it, but we didn't want to wait, so they did eat it. Same cashier lady told the kitchen staff and 3-4 other employees came out to check.  The baked potato was fine, but baked potatoes are quite hard to screw up!! The pulled pork sandwich was well below average. Very little meat and dried out.  Other customers were complaining as well. This place probably will not make it, This is unfortunate.  Received an extremely rude private Facebook message from this joke of a place with in 30 minutes of posting on here. I guess don't write a review for them unless you'd like to be told that you're slandering their business and making up lies.  Real professional."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove by one day and decided to stop in. Good food at reasonable prices. The flavors are a bit different from what I am used to in but still delicious. Everything was dry rubbed and not covered in sauces. There were 2 types of sauces at the table, a sweet and a spicy. Mix them together and it was amazing! Nothing was very spicy but they had jalapenos to help add some spice! They also had pickles and onions that you could add to your sandwiches. I haven't seen Big Red soda in any soda machine here in Arizona so that was a nice treat too. Staff was really friendly!"}
{"text":"First let me say that this should really be a 2 1/2 but that isn't an option and I don't think a 2 star vote is warranted. The restaurant has a poor set up with 2 sides and no one greeting you at the entrance. There is a menu on the wall and an unused ice cream counter so not the best way to enter an establishment. You sort of have to figure you're own way in. The food is OK. The portions are good sized but the meat is average at best. It has a decent flavor but it's fairly dry and mediocre. Anyone who appreciates good BBQ will notice this immediately. The mac and cheese is trash and is nothing but Kraft noodles with a slight hint of unflavored cheese sauce. My wife had the coleslaw and said it was terrible. The steak fries are OK but way too salty. Overall a very mediocre experience. It's basically a good alternative if you are thinking about fast food, but don't bother if you are looking for quality BBQ, because you won't find it."}
{"text":"Decided at lunch to check this place out...it has taken a couple of years to open and we were convinced that it would be fabulous inside. The dining room is broken into several smaller rooms.  The pseudo cafeteria style is reminiscent of some of the BBQ places that I have been to in Abilene, Austin, and Dallas.  Alongside the ordering line is a dining area.  On this particular night there was a loud family of 8 sitting there.  It was so loud that the person taking orders had trouble hearing orders.  The room that we went into is at the farthest end of the restaurant.  It was just okay as far as decorations...I thought the years of opening would have added some barn wood or reclaimed elements.  I wouldn't say it was bad..it is homey.  But, it took forever to open...I expected more.  The lighting was horrible for dinner.    I will say this...the attentive staff made sure that it was very clean. Props to them.  They were all pleasant and well groomed.      I don't know if the owner know that the location is cursed or not.  For their sake I hope that the new Fry's and additional businesses nearby will turn the page for Red River BBQ.   As for food... I had the loaded baked potato with Brisket.  Coming from Texas I can remember having a giant potato slathered with real butter, sour cream, cheese, chives, and mouth watering brisket.  I have tried to find this same euphoria I experienced there in Arizona.  Don't get excited...I am still looking...I didn't find it here either.  What I did find is a slightly over baked potato with an adequate amount of dressings.  The meat was warm (not hot) and  dry.  The cubed pieces that were carved uniformly didn't give me a warm fuzzy.  I am not sure if they used a flat or whole brisket...A flat could explain some of the dryness (it is inherently drier than a tip)  The brisket was not trimmed before or after smoking and there was a lot of fat.  It was really missing the slightly charred taste of a good smoked brisket.     My husband had ribs.  The ribs were meaty.  They were barely warm to the touch.  He called them cold...I called them warm.  The silverware was plastic - which is awkward for ribs.  Especially, if they appear under cooked and are definitely not fall off of the bone.    There were only two sauces and they were both on the table.  The sauces seemed average and could have been right off of the grocery store shelf.      I suppose time can help.  They have only been open for a couple of weeks so I won't con't them out yet. I may have to try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday, what a joke. This place has no chance of staying open. The owner needs to go back Texas and raise his sheep"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner and had the 3-meat plate. It was a TON of food. The brisket was delicious, not too tough, not too chewy. The sausage was pretty good, and the chicken had a delicious smoky flavor. The place was clean, the staff friendly, and it was pretty empty so we had our choice of seating. It was cute and old-timey inside. My only recommendation would be to add one more BBQ sauce option- something between the spicy and sweet. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant.  It is near my home. Not a chain.  BBQ.  I will say it was clean and the people were very nice and its new so hoping some of these issues will be resolved with increased training.  They were only accepting cash due to some computer issue due to the holidays? as per the posted sign.  The service is thru a cafeteria style line, no problem but we were the only ones in line (5 of us) and it was not efficient nor did the servers know where everything was located.  My daughter and I each had a baked potato and the server in separating them touched the meat part of the potato. :( . Once at our table the potatoes were not hot so would not melt the butter.  Most of us ordered the same BBQ meats.  While the serving size was large, the quality was inconsistent.  The first person in our line must have had older meat because it was greyish and the 5th person in our party was pink.  The flavors were not distinctive on any of the meat and sauce was forgettable.  I was personally disheartened by one of the posters that was in this family dining restaurant--it depicted three bare bottomed women.  Not a prude, just seemed like an odd choice.  I do wish this team well with their restaurant and will try again in 6 months to see if they have grown into the place."}
{"text":"The wife and I just left the BBQ joint after a late lunch. We ordered double brisket and pulled pork for our 3 meat and one side combo.   RR BBQ so far is number one on BBQ for me in this state. Get the beef brisket and you will understand wise. It's got that amazing salt and pepper crust on the outside and it's juicy and pulls apart with ease. It reminds me of Franklins BBQ in Austin.   We were going to get the jalape√±o sausage instead of double brisket, but the sausage machine was broke so they couldn't make more. The make their sausage IN HOUSE!!!! Name another BBQ joint that does that? The mac and cheese and red potatoe salad were also delicious and you could tell they didn't come from a box or store.   Their BBQ sauce is either sweet or spicy and also made IN HOUSE.   When you walk in you can go right for cafeteria style food selection or go left to the bar and patio. Both are super clean, open and offer nice decor of the southwest! They also have a full service ice cream and dessert and coffee bar and small sitting area for music. This place is really cool and I can see young and old enjoying this family owned restaurant. My favorite thing is that it was super clean and the staff was attentive and helpful.    Nobody paid me for this review nor do I know the owners or staff. I just support great small, family owned businesses and I hope the neighborhood around this gem will too!   Dig in and relax!"}
{"text":"Drove by the restaurant 8/8/17 around 3pm, gates were closed and 1 black pickup in the parking lot.. curious if they still open or not..."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to drop by early this evening to finally check this place out. This location is notorious for failed restaurants, so we were skeptical to find only a couple of cars in the parking lot when we arrived at dinner time.  1. This place seems to have an identity crisis: it's a BBQ place, and a organic pizza place, and it's an ice cream / pastry place, and it has a bar, and it has a lounge area on the opposite side of the restaurant that seems to have live music at times? Choose a theme, and stick with it. Way too much clutter and confusion. Coming into the place, there are a lot of high walls, so it is hard to see what is where. There are arrows printed on paper, pointing one way for bar, and one way for food. The menu is not really visible until you get all the way to the counter, so everyone was milling about in the counter area, trying to decide what to order. 2. We have been to many cafeteria style BBQ places, who serve food on trays and butcher paper, so no problem with that. The counter staff seemed friendly, and we had no problem ordering. 3. The decor is old and worn, and the place smelled musty, but was clean. The tablecloths are dollar store checkered plastic. As previously reported, the silverware is plastic as well. 4. We ordered the 3 meat samplers: chicken, brisket, and pulled pork. For the price, the portions were pretty good, although the chicken pieces are about the same size as the WalMart rotisserie - but there doesn't seem to be a decent sized chicken anywhere but Costco these days. 5. The chicken was tender, and the best of the three. The rub was overdone, and very salty, so I was disappointed that I couldn't eat much of the crispy skin. I'm a pulled pork fan; it was tender, but bland and very dry. The same with the brisket - hubby's fave. Nice bark, but the flavor did not translate to the meat, and it too was very dry. Don't know when they smoke their meat, but seemed like it was done yesterday. Did not smell any BBQ smoke outside, so not sure they smoke onsite. The chicken was warm, but the other meats were not. We took most of the meat home, so we could try to steam it a little and re-hydrate it, so we didn't have to throw it out. 6. Potato salad was dill / sour cream. It was as good as any other. The mac & cheese was bland, but okay. The cowboy beans had an odd spice taste - almost like a Thai spice?, and we did not get any pieces of meat in ours. We sent it back, and asked for the potato salad instead, which they promptly brought us. The jalapeno cornbread was a nice large portion, but was not fresh or hot. It had that refrigerated, gummy consistency, and the butter did not melt at all. Too bad. 7. Sauce is an epic fail. One vinegar-type with a ton of celery seed, and one sweet one that had very little flavor. It definitely ain't Rudy's sauce. I smothered the meat, and not much of a taste difference. Tasted like BBQ sauce made in New York City. No kick whatsoever. 8. A young male employee came by, and asked how everything was. I told him that it was okay, but the meat was very dry. He just wrung his hands, mumbled, and said \"Well, is there anything else you need right now?\", and left. A young female employee came by a couple of minutes later, and did the bean trading. Everyone seemed attentive, but no one seemed organized. Employees were either texting on their phones, or wandering. Nothing to draw us back here again. From the other reviews, it seems that the owner has an ego as big as Texas, but nothing to back it up. Expecting to see the For Rent sign back up soon."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy today I watched the owner curse and tell a customer to leave get into altercation with everybody there this is not any better than Golden Corral for the money the owner was cursing and telling a mother that she should have raised her son in a different way very clean Place new but no customers in the parking lot Jenny the cashier collie is cool but if I was them I was find new employment this place is not going to make it"}
{"text":"Had the Jerk chicken it was burnt no flavor. Another customer was complaining about his brisket. Beers were $6.00 each"}
{"text":"Great new place!  I've driven by this place like 100 times in the last year and wondered when it would finally be open. Now that it's open I finally got the chance to eat there.  Really nice inside and great food. I want to check it out on a weekend"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! It was old and how do you mess up potato salad. The meat was tough and inedible . I can't believe anyone eats this. Even the sauce had issues. We ended up leaving the food and sneaking out because the people were sweet but couldn't face them leave 60 worth of food"}
{"text":"Contrary to some, the staff was nice and accommodating. Although , the order taker , the cashier, and the runner all seemed to have poor attention to detail. I was first overcharged and then my order was incomplete. I fortunately caught the error and  all were very accommodating and offered very good service recovery.  Between all of our combo orders we had 2types of ribs, pulled pork, chicken, brisket and  links.  Both types of ribs were well prepared and worth returning for. The brisket was avg in my opinion,but I think there are many different preferences on brisket. The pulled park was was enjoyed by my son and the chicken was not really memorable. The links preparation need some work because they were dry and mealy.  I am not sure if I will return or not. I love BBQ and it is convenient but they have some things to work out. We will see - good luck!!!"}
{"text":"Really is unfortuntate that anyone leases this building. Anything that goes in here seems destined to fail. But this really time it really had potential, the things that put the nails in the coffin I believe was partly the pizza. You cannot be everything to everyone, the barbeque would have been enough. Then add pizza/organic grown on site veggies down the line when you have capital rolling in, not to mention full liqour license. Second, the length of time to open was outrageous; 2 years with a coming soon banner, this is barbeque, not the next Michelin star fine dining establishment. Besides iritating future diners, this burns capital paying rent on a  place not making a dime. Third and final nail, not opening with the new frys grocery store. That amount of traffic could have been a blessing and gave this location the marketing kick start  that, anyone lives in this area knows this location needed. The sausage was very good, and brisket was ok. I hate to see resturants fail, especially in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excited that the restaurant is open! We enjoyed the baby back ribs and jerk chicken.... both were perfectly tender! We tried both the hot and sweet BBQ sauces.... enjoyed them both, particularly their sweet sauce! The staff was friendly and attentive.... stopped by several times to see if we needed anything! We met the owner who was very nice and appreciative we stopped in for dinner!  Looking forward to trying the pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Glad to finally see this place open after driving by it for two years! I was pleased with my order of the smoked turkey sandwich and potato salad. That smoked turkey had just the right amount of flavor where it didn't need any sauce and the potato salad reminded me of going to a picnic! Hubby went with the 3 meat combo which of course I had to taste. The mac and cheese side was good. The meats need a little work in our opinion. The poultry part was best between my smoked turkey and his chicken. I felt the brisket was a bit dry while the hubs felt it needed seasoning inside the meat. They do have the outside of the brisket crusted. The pulled pork was greasy and fatty. They could stand with putting silverware and napkins on the table as a courtesy. You order at the counter and they give you a number and bring the food to the table.  The interior is super cute and welcoming. With a little work and ironing the kinks out this place can be great!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich is great!  Pulled chicken sandwich was very good. Sandwiches were hot and the tables sauces were both good. Cole slaw is great and the backed beans were also very good."}
{"text":"Wow, the owners response to the recent review is exactly why this place closed. He blames everyone else when in reality the food wasn't good and it is definitely not upscale. There was a body found behind Spinatos a year ago and they are busier than ever. My husband and I went when it opened and never went back. I was counting the days until it closed."}
{"text":"We were driving down Bell Road, deciding where to eat when we passed this place and made a U-turn and were very glad we did.  I can't always convince my family to eat barbecue, but on occasion they will agree.    I read some of the other reviews and was pleased to see that the restaurant had read them and made the changes suggested.  Food was hot, service was friendly, helpful and courteous, and the place was clean.    I have been to many barbecue establishments in Kansas City, and this place took me back.  It was bigger than many of the places in Kansas City for being a non-chain restaurant which was a super plus!  Sampling is allowed before ordering and prices were reasonable.   I can't wait for my next visit to try more of the food.  We had the pulled pork sandwiches which were very good.  Great smoky flavor to the meat and I was impressed with their choice of sauces.  Most barbecue places have their own signature sauces and this place follows suit.  I don't care for too many sauces, but the sauces at this place were delicious.  We also ordered one of the pizza's which had very tasty ingredients, great sauce, and a very good crispy crust which we enjoyed very much.  They clearly have put a lot of work into this restaurant and I look forward to going to this place again.  It's been raining so the patio was closed, but looks like a fun place to enjoy drinks on mild evenings. Lots of comfy seating and TV's for entertainment.    I hope more people find this gem and love it as much as my family and I did!!!"}
{"text":"Well after a long time waiting for this place to open I was surprised at what I saw today.  There was a customer that believed his Brisket was tough so he asked one of the staff to return it,  she was very pleasant and said she would and asked if there was anything else she could get him instead.  The man said no thank you.  About 15 minutes passed and there was still no response from the manager.  The gentleman asked another server if he could just get a refund.  She stated that the owner was on the phone and would be out in a few minutes, the man stated \"no worries not that big of a deal just thought it was taking a while\". Again about 15 minutes later a man came over and abruptly asked the customer \"What seems to be the problem\". The customer stated that there was no problem and that his Brisket was very tough.  The man who represented himself as the owner stated if it was tough why did you eat half of it.  The customer stated that he ate 1 Slice and 1 small piece hoping it was just the first piece.  Then the \"Owner stated well I tasted it and it did not seem tough to me\". The customer then asked why the owner was being so rude.  The owner then snapped at the man and said \"all I will give you is a refund for what you didn't eat\" The customer stated that will be fine it is not about the money it was about letting you know that there might be a problem with your product.  What ever you feel is appropriate is min e by me.  The owner then walked away mumbling under his breath.  So not to be repetitive it was again about 15 to 20 minutes and the customer finally got up to leaver and the so-called owner was sitting down in what must be a lounge type area and the customer said \"Thank for the great customer service we will not be back and the owner yelled back good bye\". The nan should have just left at that point but he turned and stated to the server This is the type of thing that will assure that you continue to get bad review.  The owner jumped up and started yelling get out and swearing uncontrollably F&%k you, F&%k you.  Then the man left only to be followed out by both the customer and what we were told was his father.  The son continued to yell stating you called me scrawny, and I heard the customer say no I described you as lanky.  Then the man left.    That said I will not return!!! Any place that treats customers like that should not be in business!  We followed the customer as did a few others.  In the Future the father should keep his son from talking to customers or at least on a very short leash!!  On a side note.  We had the Brisket  and the pulled pork Sandwich,  The customer was right the brisket was tough and the Pork in the sandwich was dry and flavorless.  If not for the terrible way the customer was treated we would have given them another chance but with the bad food and the terrible customer service we will not be returning.    I suggest the many other restaurants in the area or how did the other reviewer put it?  Go to Arbys  After reading the response from the restaurant let me assure you that there was absolutely no Racism used by either party!  Not from either the business or the customer.  There was swearing however but that came from the business owner early on in the conversation if that is what you want to call it.  The customer did his best to avoid the situation until the owners son puffed his chest out and tried to intimidate the customer.  Which by the look from the look on the customers face and how heated the owners son became.  I don't think he was successful.  I feel sorry for the folks having to work under these conditions and for a man like that.    After reading the previous reviews about this establishment I don't think we will be seeing them much longer.  Shame!  Cause their staff were quite nice.  However it is obvious the owners come from a place where that type of behavior is common place.  Just so you are aware the person in question was not my friend.  We were in the back two tables away from them my wife, son, and I all heard the owners son not only swear but yell at the customer.  If you are the father you did not come out and get involved until it got out side.  So if the story your getting is otherwise you my friend are the one that is mistaken.  As for my Arby's suggestion.  That pertained to the quality of your food.  However the food can be fixed, the customer service cannot.  People don't act like you as the owners son did out of the blue.  As for shutting you down.  Not my intention.  My intention was to let others know of my experience at your establishment.  If you choose to ignore or call it lies like it seems you do on many occasions when you get a bad review, that say loads about your integrity as well.  I wish you good luck with your restaurant."}
{"text":"We live around the corner and have been waiting to see when this place would open.  We finally came in today during their soft opening.  Staff are still being trained so there may be a learning curve at the moment but the food was excellent.  I had the pulled pork and chicken sandwich with corn on the cobb as a side.  Service was friendly on top of the excellent food.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Everything was pathetic except for the ribs... and all served cold...not room temperature, but cold... hard to mess up cornbread but they found a way to do it.   Brisket was not good, and cold... The owner also need a couple lessons in customer service...  don't waste your time going here"}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in the area for 25 years, and remember other restaurants that have been in this building -- we want this one to stay!  They have a garden for their organic pizza ingredients, a lawn, a patio...I intend to become a regular.  He had a brisket-pulled pork sandwich with beans and a beer he gave good marks; I'm a weird eater but they were very accommodating, and did their giant baked potato with the BBQ chicken right on it, and the 'loaded' on the side.  Odd but great music, the raw wood interior decor shows loads of personal heartfelt attention.  This place is someone's dream, and I want to \"buy local\" enough to help make it come true.  Next time I'm going for a drink on the patio, or in the new lounge...and the time after that for a build-your-own sundae with peanut butter and caramel."}
{"text":"I'll say the food wasn't worth the money. We dropped over $60.00 for 2 adults and 3 kids (2 of which shared a meal). The food was smoked nicely but it wasn't anything I couldn't do in my own backyard. We had a smorgasbord of different meats that were unfortunately dry. I will admit the pizza crust had rosemary in it and that was good. The iced tea tasted like water and the bbq sauce was served in ketchup bottles. The spicy bbq sauce was chunky (apparently homemade) so when you tried to get it out of the ketchup bottle tip it exploded everywhere. The interior was DATED and there were maybe 4 cars in the parking lot, 3 probably belonging to employees. 2 stars is simply because the staff was soo nice and helpful.  Update: After receiving a back handed apology from the business's social media clown, it's obvious this business has no shame. I looked at other reviews for this business and the business got into a back and forth \"argument\" with another customer who didn't approve! Grow up! You can't talk to customers like that and be successful. You reply to reviews for shameless advertisement and then invite people back to eat your crappy food. You guys couldnt pack a parking lot if your business depended on it. And remember \"Jesus loves you!\""}
{"text":"This was our last visit . . . Food was horrible, tasted old, stale and jalapeno cornbread was so hard - like it sat around all day in a warmer. I quit eating there after our 2nd visit - chicken wasn't fully cooked. Youngest son got bad food on the 3rd visit. Only my oldest still liked it! The beef brisket but after today (10th) we wont be back."}
{"text":"Well dinner tonight with my beautiful Texas Rose my wife Crystal was at The Red River Bq, Definitely worth a return visit, I enjoyed the concept, the food was good, I had the 3 meat sampler with Brisket (not over seasoned but done the way I enjoy my smoked meat a smoky pecan flavor and the taste of beef) The jerk chicken vary good, The pulled pork I asked for a bun on the side and created a great tasting sandwich with Coleslaw and Pork) they do a vary good tasting Jalapeno Corn Bread that I Thoroughly enjoyed slathered with butter along with the meal I enjoyed a Ginger bread Ale from Bison Brewery in San Jose Ca, Todd the owner came out and greeted us (I had visited a few weeks earlier one morning and talked with Todd about his opening and style of cooking, I was pleased when he remembered my name) we finished with a complementary couple scoops of Pecan Praline Ice cream. I will say this is a vary pleasant Restaurant, the staff are calming down and the start up kinks are being fixed, This is vary good food for reasonable dollars, They have a vary good concept with this place and I look forward to many future visits and I hope you will visit, remember this is a New Restaurant and the staff are learning so give them a chance..."}
{"text":"I just had lunch there, and ordered the three meat combo. I had hot links, brisket, and jerk chicken.  It was horrible I didn't finish eating it.  The bark of any was barely detectable on the brisket and it was tough.  True test is the pull apart test but it would not pull apart. Go to Bobby Q and your sad when your brisket is gone,here I only ate two slices.   The jerk chicken was flavorless and dry. I don't know if they smoke them, but it was not cooked to order, it was barely warm.  It was quite obvious they just reheated it.  I don't know why you would do that with chicken breast there is not enough fat to do that to the meat.  The hot links had no snap, again I compare them to Bobby Qs which are good.  I did enjoy the wonderful cashier who took the brunt of my complaints.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Looks cool, and has potential. That's the only reason it's not getting one star. Food wasn't good, service was mediocre. Never going back."}
{"text":"I got food to go from this place on January 7, 2017. When we brought the food home, the potato looked as if it was 2 days old and a dark brown. We were also missing side orders, the ribs were extremely raw, and the beef was extremely burnt. I called the restaurant to let them know of the issues, and a gentlemen told me  \" Bring back the food that is bad. If you don't bring the food back, don't come.\" We came back a few hours later and the manager showed sincere apologies and told us he would refund our money. I waited for ten minutes and when he came back, he would not look me in the eyes. He then proceeded to state the his boss refused the refund and gave me $6 for the potato, and napkin full of cold ribs. I asked to speak to the higher up manager and when he came out he states \" I am not giving you money for the missing sides unless there is proof that they were not there.\" He then physically pushed me out the door. This was the worst experience I have EVER had at a restaurant. I am not the kind of person that would ever go on yelp to make a complaint but this experience leads me to no choice. No human being should ever be treated like this at a place of business. Save your time, money, and hunger and refrain from ever walking into this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich. The pork was tender and juicy. The sauce was definitely unique but good. I'm used to a little stronger vinegar and this was a little on the sweet side. It's cafeteria style similar to Rudy's or you can sit in the bar and the bartender will serve you. The patio is also a nice quiet place to eat. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good barbecue place and finally found one right around the corner! The ribs fell right off the bone and were as tender as butter. And the mac n cheese--SO good! Ended my trip with a chocolate peanut butter hand spun shake, which I highly recommend. Friendly employees and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The owner is a idiot, he does not know how to run a successful business...using foul language is inappropriate with new customers"}
{"text":"First time eating there, and I was not disappointed. I had their 3 meat platter, with the hot links, pulled pork, and brisket (they were out of the sliced, so I got the chopped that usually goes on sandwiches. The guy did ask me before hand if that was ok, instead of just giving it to me. Which I appreciated.)    I would however suggest a bun or something, because having just the meats, and the side seemed a little incomplete.    The meat was very good. The pulled pork was tender, and flavorful. The chopped brisket was a little dry, but just a little, the fatty pieces in it helped bring some moisture back to the pallet. So over all the brisket was good. The hot link was pretty good as well, it had a good smoke ring, and I didn't find it to be dry. The little kick it had was nice, if you like some heat.   We went in thinking it was a sit down place, and we were surprised (not in a bad way) to see it was an order window set up, where you pay ahead, and then sit. They bring it out to you. The staff was friendly, and they were attentive to clear our plates. Mind you the place was not busy. A little more interaction from the staff, and maybe an offering to bring water would have been nice.   There wasn't much of a beet selection, but it was in a tub, so you can grab one as you get to the window. I went to the bar to get a draft. Having a beer menu would be a plus, with a server/table checker so I don't have to walk to the bar to get another beer. However, it kind of makes it feel like you get 1 beer with your meal. Who wants to get up to get another beer? Hence having a server/table checker (I don't know what else to call them) would be nice.    Also, they have an ice cream/dessert area, but no one asked if we wanted dessert. Offering that may help bring in more revenue because it will bring attention to more of what they can offer.    Granted I know they are a work in progress having just opened less than a month ago, and they still need to find their way of doing things. Overall the experience was not bad, just needs a little bit more of the kinks worked out. We'll wait a little, but we will be back in the not too distant future."}
{"text":"We have been waiting probably more than a year for this place to open as we live in the area.  Went there this evening at 6pm.  Handful of people in there but it was early so didn't think too much about it.  When we walked in we weren't sure what to do; if to wait to be seated or what.  A man walked up to us and we asked if we would be seated or just find our own place.  He was kind of condescending and said it was cafeteria style.  We go through the line and order and get our food.  \"it's a Texas style BBQ; that's how they all are!\"  Okay then  We get in the line and look at the menu.  While we were deciding a couple came up and knew what they wanted so we let them go ahead of us.  They ordered and I hear the guy behind the counter say it would be about 15 minutes.  At the time I didn't know for what.   Then we ordered two sandwiches and a jumbo baked potato to share.  The kid said it would be 15 minutes for the potato.  He put the order in for the sandwiches and we said we wanted it all at the same time.  He said the sandwiches were already being made.  He said they ran out of potatoes.  It was only 6pm, so I thought that was kind of strange.  So we cancelled the potato.  the couple in front got their food minus the potato and went to a table.  We got our, paid for it right there at the end of the counter and ends up sitting behind the couple.  The food was nothing special.  My brisket was very fatty, sauces nothing to write home about.  The mac N cheese was not bad.  But Dickey's BBQ is much better and the selection is greater.    The woman finally got her potato but she had ordered it without meat, but it came with meat on it.  She found someone and told them they needed to bring her another one.  I'd y it was at least 15 minutes and she never got it and they ended up leaving.  they were both finished with their other food.  They had also gone to get more to drink from the fountain and both were out of ice.  They told someone but I didn't see anyone getting more ice.    We left while they were still trying to get their money back for the potato,  We will not be going back.  It's too bad because we could use a good restaurant in the area.  I don't hold out much hope that this will turn into a good one.    Another thing that I did not appreciate is that the sides and drinks are served in styrofoam.  Not good for the environment at all."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of smoked foods or very knowledgeable to what my expectations should be. The service needs help thats a hard thing to accomplish when just opening up especially when you are not a chain restaurant.  Besides all that the ribs were tender and moist as well as the chicken both were very good. Slaw was good baked potato was big enough for 2. Corn was good. Heineken needed to be colder. All in all pleasant surprise. Definitely will come back again and try the pizza."}
{"text":"This the first and, hopefully, the last review I have felt compelled to write.  This is a new restaurant and it's very obvious if you try to eat here.  First it is a cafeteria style operation with no wait staff only delivery persons.  That's OK with me as many good operations are like this.  Upon reaching the order counter I was informed that they don't offer Prime Rib on Fridays and that they are out of Turkey, this on a Friday evening at 5:45?? after ordering from the remaining choices I had a sampler plate, salad and a soft drink, a little over $20.00!! My friend ordered a similar plate and we looked for seating, the only table we could find was dirty.  We started to notice the delivery persons were wondering around with that \"deer in the headlights look\" trying to find whose order they had?  They give you a large number card for your table but apparently did not share this concept with their staff. Other patrons were waiving them down and asking for things that were missing or wrong.  When my order finally was delivered it was barely warm and the portion was very small for what was advertised as 3/4 pound.  The salad had no dressing and was so dry and wilted that it could have been yesterdays.  The meal was OK but cold and I didn't finish it.  When the bus boy asked if I was done I said yes and he asked if everything was OK and I said \"no, is the manager available\" he said he would look for him.  After waiting probably 10 minutes we went to another restaurant and had a great meal!!  No I wont ever eat here again, there are way too many great places to eat close to here.  This review probably would not have even been written if the manager could have been found, but then again, if I were responsible for this fiasco I would probably be hiding too!"}
{"text":"The brisket & BBQ sauce is great! It's new & they are still learning but it's great food. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"745pm on a Monday night. Place was a ghost town, kinda sad for a new establishment.   Weird set up when u first walk in, no host stand, just 2 pieces of paper on a wall directing u. U have a choice to go left to the bar, or right to the cafeteria style line/order station. I went right, as I was with my family. Menu is on a big board over head with a friendly girl behind the steam table waiting to take your order. U move to the right after u make your selections and pay for your food and drinks, they give u a number, and u find your own table. No silverware in house, all plastic. Don't forget to grab it before u get to your table, it's at its own station as u exit the order line. Decent soda selection, my wife was thrilled to see they actually have Big Red soda out of the fountain drinks.   Food - I have mixed feeling about. I had the 3 meat sampler and chose the brisket, bbq chicken, and jalape√±o hot links. U can choose 1 side, I went with the beans. The brisket and sausage was good, and not dry, a concern of mine because I ate there so late in the day. I didn't get to the chicken because I was full, but it looked tasty. The sides tho.... might be some of the worst BBQ joint sides I've ever had. My son got the mac and cheese, awful. The beans were lacking in brown sugar and/or molasses, although a decent amount of meat was in the beans. The BBQ sauce - u have 2 choices, sweet or spicy. The spicy had good flavor but was very spicy - but I also LIKE spicy food. The sweet was definitely sweet, u could tell there was some apricot or something of that nature mixed into the sauce. A little too sweet for me.   Overall, decent BBQ but could definitely use some different recipes for their sides. Mac and cheese was nasty and the beans were just OK. I'll try the cornbread next time. The meats were good, and that's what I go the BBQ joints for. The next time I will try the ribs.   I would go back and I know my wife wants to go back just because of the Big Red. If they manage to change their side dishes for the better I would easily give this place a 4 or 5 star rating"}
{"text":"After driving by this place for the past few years, it's Finally OPEN! Went with friends to try it out because it's BBQ! And so, so, so YUMMY! Everything was great! The food, Staff and even the owner came to our table to ask how everything was. A very nice man. I wish them well and success. Every business has *Kinks* to be worked out. I for one will not judge them on that. The food and service is whats important."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night with a friend. We had both read the reviews and were not impressed but it's not far from home and we went hoping they had worked out the \"new business\" kinks. This place just opened about 10 days ago. There are definitely a few things that could be improved upon. The staff, for starters, they are nice and welcoming but didn't inspire a lot of confidence. Not much in the way of product knowledge. They all should have been trained on this before opening day! Then the cashier told us he thought he was going to \"screw it up\" so had someone else complete our transaction. Honestly, you just don't say something like that to a customer. I don't know if there are any managers there but someone needs to mentor and train the staff much better. I say this more as a former restaurant manager, not as a customer, because a great staff with excellent customer service skills is so crucial to keeping a business going. Nice and welcoming will only get you so far.  I will say the food was pretty good. I had the brisket and my friend had the pork and sausage, which I tried. I enjoyed the brisket. The pork was tasty but the sausage was a bit dry. It had some kick to it so the flavor was okay but it was lacking that bit of fat needed to lend flavor and texture. They make the sausage from scratch every morning and the chef told us they are bringing on a new chef soon who only makes sausage, so it sounds promising (and reason for a follow up visit).  For sides, my friend had the cowboy beans, which were not bad. I had the coleslaw which was good. They even gave me a sample of it while ordering to make sure I liked it.  When we were finished, I asked for a to go container for my leftover brisket and what I was brought was a large piece of paper that delis use for wrapping up meat. I wrapped my meat in it but some grease seeped through so I had to hold it in my hands on the drive home, so points off for that. And he never did bring me a lid for my coleslaw like he said he would. Sigh.  I had hoped a BBQ place like this would offer more than one sauce, which was a decent sauce, but a variety would really complement this place. It wasn't a bad first experience but I am hoping a future visit will provide me with the good customer service needed to generate a steady and growing business and keep a place like this filled with repeat customers. I am also hoping a future visit will also garner an update with more stars."}
{"text":"I saw this place open a few weeks ago and decided to let them settle in before trying it, and certainly before writing a review. I can't imagine how or why people would knowingly post a review complaining about nervous new workers and startup glitches at a new business, what kind of lives do they have that they never started a new job or learned something new? Oh wait, don't answer that!  Here is a little tour of my visit for a late lunch today. Pretend I've got a GoPRO camera and you're following me:  1. Arrival - the entire place is surrounded by an iron fence with only one tiny driveway toward the back. I'm not saying that's a negative only that it is kinda like arriving at San Quentin during a lockdown. However PLENTY of parking and with that huge fence you can be sure your car will be safe.  2. First impression - the place is absolutely huge, I guess that's one of the dangers (or benefits) of taking over an existing building. There is a very large outdoor patio with more TV's than I could count.  3. Walking in the door - a little odd, there is no one at the front door to greet you and your choices are to turn left to the bar or turn right to enter the restaurant but if it's your first time you might stand there waiting for someone to show you to your table.  But no, instead you hear a friendly voice from somewhere inside the restaurant accompanied with a welcoming wave to come on in.  4. Approaching the order counter your eyes glaze over at the menu choices on the big board over the counter. But rather than be confused there is an eager, friendly and helpful young man who takes the time to go over all (I mean all) of the menu choices. He does so patiently and without that \"hurry up\" feeling you get at most restaurants. Ask him a question and he has the exact answer you're looking for.  5. While ordering you have a choice of grabbing a beer, soft drink or other beverage (even milk) from in huge tin bucket filled with ice, real down home style. They also have a soft drink dispenser.  6. The previously mentioned super-helpful young man gives you a ticket once he takes your order and asks you to step down a few feet to Marilyn who is waiting at the cashier table. She's the same person who gave you the howdy welcome when you first walked in and she's about the sweetest nicest person you will ever meet. She actually made my day.  While paying I can't help but notice that the cook and several people who look like owners/managers are watching everything that's going on. I took that as an indication they were genuinely trying to iron out any grand opening wrinkles and see what works and what doesn't work. Which is why a review written in the first few days a restaurant is open should have given them the benefit of the doubt before blasting them.  7. The food is delivered to the table in a reasonable amount of time on parchment paper on a tin tray. I remark that this is exactly how it is served in some of the best hole-in-the-wall little BBQ places I've discovered in Texas and I'm told guess what, the owners are from Texas.  8. I ordered a meat sampler to get an idea of what they are capable of. I specified brisket, jalapeno sausage and barbecue chicken priced at $13.99 (dirt cheap for any barbecue place anywhere unless your idea of barbecue is a McRib sandwich). I posted a picture. It is not only a good value, it is a great value.  9. The tablecloths are red checkered, the napkins are paper and the utensils are plastic.  If you arrived in your Rolls Royce expecting fine china and sterling silver you don't know a heck of a lot about barbecue, do you?  10. Reading the rest of the reviews some people say it is the best barbecue they've ever had. They are probably relatives of the owner. Some people say it is the worst. They probably would have been better off with a McRib.  I say it is good and reasonably priced, not the best I have ever had but I'll be back to see how they mature. The brisket was better than average, the chicken was maybe just slightly better than average and the sausage was good but there was so little of it I didn't feel I got a good enough taste.  The sides (mac/cheese, and potato salad that I ordered as an extra side) were marginal, but to be fair even at the best little barbecue places in Texas it is rare to find really great sides.  For now I can't rate Red River BBQ as a perfect 5 because they haven't earned it yet but overall I liked the atmosphere of a \"real\" (non-chain) Texas barbecue pit in the neighborhood, good food at a good price and a super-friendly staff that made me feel like an old friend."}
{"text":"First at any barbecue is the food. It's good, especially the baby backs. The sausage texture is different, but that's a definite plus difference. The slaw is exceptional. Now to the staff, a real pleasure. Seriously, these are nice people who want their customers to feel welcome. We loved the spaciousness and the decor is western without overdoing as  is the music. One negative, add more pickles and onions on the side. Those pickles are darn good to highlight this fine 'cue."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the pleasure of trying Red River yesterday. While not exactly your traditional BBQ place as the flavors were a bit differnt than your chians. The sauces are more savory than sweet and the meats are smoky and delicious. It has just opened so there are some hiccups but we had a nice experience and I am sure as the place gets some experience they will continue to improve. They have a garden outside where they source their salad veggies. We had the sampler with brisket/chicken/pork. The brisket was a bit dry but had a really good flavor and with the au jus and bbq sauce provided it was quite good. The I would like to tell you how the chicken was but my wife devoured it before i could even try it. She said it was great. The pork was not greasy at all and had good flavor. The potato salad was sour cream based with dill and was really good. I ordered a 2 meat sandwitch with pork and hotlinks. The pork again is really good. The hotlinks were decent but not great. I had ranch beans that I really enjoyed, they had big chunks of bbq meat in them.   I am not going to say its better than Bobby Q or Pork on Fork (my fav) but is really good and its a bit different from a flavor profile. They also have a full bar and a nice setting with a good size patio and bar."}
{"text":"I am really hopeful for this restaurant but our first visit wasn't great. Great attempt at Texas BBQ concept. Our recommendations are condiment bar with pickles onions jalape√±os etc. Serve white sliced bread with meal and label the BBQ sauce bottles as they weren't intuitive. Meat a little dry on our visit. We will be back though to try the pizza and support the restaurant in our community."}
{"text":"This restaurant (?) recently opened in my neighborhood and I thought I would stop by for a drink and some lunch today; what an absolute bust.  When I first stopped late this morning, they were not quite ready for customers; when I stopped later in the afternoon  - they truly didn't want my business.  After sitting at the bar for ten minutes I finally called the restaurant phone number and reached a recording, and left a message that I was trying to get a drink and some lunch.  After an additional minute or so, I went into the restaurant side and encountered the \"owner\" who said the bar didn't open until three, but I could have a beer in the restaurant, but not a drink; it turns out is not really a BBQ \"restaurant\" at all, but a get in line, grab a tray and place an order type place.  I commented to the \"owner\" that I noticed a pick-up truck parked in the marked \"disabled spot\" out front that had been there since I had stopped hours  earlier  - without a placard - and he said that it was his truck (duh! - as if I hadn't guessed that already); and said it was his restaurant, his parking lot, and if I didn't like it; he didn't need my business.  'Nuff said.  Avoid this a****** who has decided that the truly disabled don't need accessible parking.  Note: I had uploaded a photo of the truck referenced above; showing neither an appropriate plate or placard.  The owner of the vehicle advised Yelp that since it showed his license plate, it violated his privacy.  Yelp correctly removed the photo and so advised me."}
{"text":"Great local BBQ pit.   I had the pulled pork and brisket combo with pasta salad.  Tasty fall apart meat accompanied with an awesome sauce they call sweet and sassy!   The pasta was very tasty also.  Manger was very friendly and asked all our questions.   It reminds me of a Ol town western restaurant with lots of southern flare.  For just opening they are doing great.  Can't wait to see the place when they get a band.   We will be back again.  Thanks for a great lunch :)"}
{"text":"This place is definitely on my \"I'm Hungry and want food list\". I aways support local over chains when possible, and this fits the bill.  Food quality has always been outstanding and portion sizes are excellent for the price.  The employees are super friendly, and will make anything \"right\", so it is your fault if you don't ask.  Being a BBQ person, I understand that one BBQ doesn't fit all (that Texas versus East / North East Coast varieties) but this is good Texas style BBQ.  The Brisket is smoked to perfection, the pulled pork is fantastic with light sauce, and well when the place makes their own sausage that is down home yummy, what can you say.  I'm sold..  Been here multiple times and dragged the whole extended family, not a complaint to be heard...  Keep up the good work, and see you soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE  Waste of time, waste of money.  This place literally scarred me.  I couldn't eat BBQ for months!"}
{"text":"Well we have been waiting for a year for this place to open. We were there on the first day. The counter staff had to ask the kitchen staff after each time I requested an item, (to see if they had any made).  I thought that was strange. After we settled on food they indeed had prepared, the check out was slow because she was unsure of prices. I got turkey, very good.  Constant companion got ribs, also good.  The potato salad was good, mustard type, but the cornbread muffin was uncooked on the inside.  We later were told it was melted cheese, but I know the difference. You do not need any sauce on the meat.  They really have that down!  The service and sides could use some attention. Remember, it was the very first day, so we will try again. We want this place to be a success!  We need good BBQ!   They certainly know how to prepare meats!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with my friend and his daughter...we ordered a pizza and the 3 item sampler...honestly nothing really tasted all that great...pizza had to much sauce and just was kinda messy...and the meat for the sampler...pulled pork was dry and bland...brisket was not good and the jerk chicken was horrible! I personally love BBQ and this was just not good...I don't think we will be back...sad because the place has tons of potential!"}
