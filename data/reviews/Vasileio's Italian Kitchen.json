{"text":"We come here the last few years when we visit the whitewater center.  We are a group of teens and adults with a variety of dietary preferences.  The menu has a lot of variation and everyone is able to find something they like.  The service is friendly and the portions are good sized, very important when feeding hungry teenagers."}
{"text":"Good food, huge portions, and reasonable prices - not to mention friendly, attentive staff.  Not sure what \"salty and bland\" means (pick one or the other, please), but this place is neither."}
{"text":"We eat here often and went here for dinner on 8/8/14. Food is great, but since combining Billy's barbecue menu and staff service has gone downhill. Waited for over 30 mins for food at the 1 hr 15 min mark, we asked for boxes for leftovers which never arrived.  So we paid and left as we were tired off sitting there. Waitress was nice but entire staff totally overwhelmed by Friday night crowd. We told the manager but she seemed to not really care or offer anything in response. We won't return for a long time if ever."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went to this Italian restaurant and upon arrival we was seated  only to find out that table in front of us was dirty with food on the table and drinks still left on the table.  Not to mention that there and there was only 6 people in the restaurant seated so there was no reason for the tables to be dirty. 
The waitress was very nice and pleasant with a smile but the ambiance was short in regards to and Italian Eatery. 

The small town location substituted for the lack of decor and ambiance and if I would of guessed this place was probably another restaurant cause there was not enough on the menu that satisfied our appetite as far as Italian dishes goes so we just ordered some Greek chicken that was suggested by the waitress and it saved the day it was very good. 

The salads was good and the plates were cold and that's always good for a salad. 

The prices was very inexpensive and the menu had a lot of specials if your looking for a variety of foods. 

Last but least the name of the place is not easy to pronounce for the sake of telling a friend or family member to visit. The outdoor appeal is so unattractive and I doubt if the place will stay open if they don't make this place look better on the outside and inside. 

I give this place 3 stars cause the food was good and the low pricing but it would be hard to choose this place over nearby eateries."}
{"text":"This four star rating is for the service and the pizza. If you go here, GET THE PIZZA. It's amazing and full of toppings and herbs and spices and magic. I'd been on the hunt for a good pizza- I'm over chain restaurants and wanted to find a pizza place that made their pies with love. Vasileio's is it. I've had the supreme and the pepperoni, and both were delish. Before I was turned onto the pizza, I had a couple of other dishes off the menu- the Greek chicken with rice and the chicken marsala. The chicken was okay but the rice was flavorless. And the Marsala was just bad. Like...awful. BUT THEN I HAD THE SUPREME PIZZA. And that turned it all around for me. The inside is very quaint and homey, like an Italian diner. There are a couple of TVs, but it's not really a place I'd go to catch the game. The waitstaff is always pleasant, and they've never messed up a to-go order. Plus when I ordered pizza last week, they had a special where each large pizza order received a free 2-liter soda. WINNING! Come here! (For the pizza lol!)"}
{"text":"Local, simple and delicious. This Italian restaurant is economical and family friendly. I had spaghetti and meatballs. Yum"}
{"text":"No beer - No wine - Salad was large.  Tammy liked the spaghetti and the fact she didn't have to cook tonight.  My Stromboli was weak - to lite on the promised Italian Spices - wasn't expecting the fresh tomatoes- it watered it down.   Did I mention no beer or wine.   Yes Roberta you caught in Mount Holly again for the second time in under a week.  :)"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food, another place trying to do to much. If you are an Italian restaurant just do Italian and please do it well. Not even as good as Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, aside from pretty subpar french fries. The house dressings are wonderful, as is the Italian sub and the chicken wings. Cute restaurant, has a cozy feel and polite waitstaff."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, stuck in mt holly for a bit, and it was delicious! They bring out breadsticks with the most amazing marinara sauce! Better that any I have had in forever, the waitress said it is home made.  I had a Greek salad with chicken and my friend had the chicken souvlaki pita with fried okra as a side. The salad was fresh and full of my favorite yummy veggies, red onions and peppers.  Th fried okra was hot fresh and sooooo good. Table near is had pizza and it looked tasty as well. Service was very courteous and efficient, nice strawberry blond waitress and very helpful. I would def go back!"}
{"text":"Leaves much to be desired.

Been curious about this place for some time and finally decided to give them a try since we were going to be in the area.  Had a hair cut appointment at noon so we got a bit of late start and got there around 1:30.  At my age, I no longer pay for a hair cut but it's more of a finders fee.

Pulled into the parking lot and admired the Christmas Painting still on the windows. Gave a homey feel to the place.

Walked into an otherwise empty lobby with one couple ahead of us. Turns out they were take out and waiting for their order. We stood there for awhile until someone finally came over to seat us.  Restaurant looked to be about 1/3 full with multiple unbused tables waiting to be cleaned.

There appeared to be only one server to service the entire dining area plus one manager and another person who would come out occasionally to clean I suspect.

We got our menus and ordered our beverages which for both of us was tea although mine we half and half unsweetened and sweeten tea to get the sweetness level right.

I was very excited about the menu because it was a mixture of Italian and Greek with Subs and Wraps as well.

Spotted one of my favorites which was Moussaka but when I tried to order it, I got the deer in the headlights look that told me it was not available and I suspect lots of other dishes that require intensive preparation would not be as well.

Big disappointment.

I ended up ordering and Italian Sausage Parmesan Sub with side of Fries.  

My wife ordered a Philly Cheese Steak Wrap with a okra subed for the Fries.

While we waited, our server brought out bread sticks with a marinara dipping sauce.  My wife declined the bread but the server became very defensive and said that they were complementary and we did not have to pay for them. 

Not the issue.

My wife is on a diet and has to limit what she eats and bread is big source of carbohydrates. If she wanted the bread, price would not have the issue. In the end, I ate the Break Sticks but found the Marinara Dipping Sauce to be devoid of flavor.

Lunch came out and again the Marinara on the Sub had no taste of tang and did not add anything to the sandwich.  Fries even though a nice presentation were not very good either and were actually hard and crunchy.

My wife said her wrap was OK and did enjoy the Okra but other than that, nothing to write home about.

In the end, a lot of other places we could have tried and will do so next time."}
{"text":"Th food was absolutely terrible. The sauce was disgusting. I've never tasted anything like it. I'm very surprised that this place is still open. I hate leaving this bad review, but it's true."}
{"text":"Found an ant on the menus, found a hair in my salad. The gyro plate is a little greasy for our liking. I had the eggplant parm and was a little greasy but still not great. Service was okay but there was no one in there on Labor Day and plus the older man sitting behind us wouldn't stop staring at my boyfriend. 
I will say my salad was very fresh other than the hair and two wilted pieces of lettuce."}
{"text":"The server was wonderful, the food was pretty good too!  A nice little restaurant!  I got the manicotti, my husband got the fettuccine.  We both loved them!"}
{"text":"We eat here occasionally. The service is very good especially when you have Mackenzie. I really like their pizza, cheese tortellini, and breadsticks. However, they have been skimping out on the portion served. The cheese tortellini is around $9. That has a lot to do with us returning as customers."}
{"text":"Tried this place once, won't go back. My dish was probably made the day or 2 before and microwaved to reheat it when served to me. My husband's dish was salty and bland. His dish had sausage in it and he said it tasted like a dirty sock. I only had 2 bites of mine it was so awful. My daughter's dish was the fettuccine Alfredo and it was salty and also was so congealed on the plate it was more of a blob that wouldn't move than pasta. The prices were on the high side. If the food had been good, no problem with paying those prices though. Might be a good candidate for the show 'Kitchen Nightmares'"}
{"text":"Horrific service. There is a sign to wait to be seated when you first walk in and we waited entirely too long to be seated. This was our first mistake. Once we were finally seated we waited and waited for someone to take our drink order. Honestly should have left at that point, but we were already there and pretty hungry so we decided to wait it out. She eventually came over and took our drink order and we put in an order for an appetizer. She came back awhile later with our drinks but no appetizer. At this point we've been here around 30 minutes and she STILL hasn't even taken our main order. My husband was getting increasingly agitated (poor food service is one of his biggest pet peeves) so when she eventually returned to get our order (well past the 30 minute mark) I asked for the ticket just for our drinks. She fumbled around and finally gave us the ticket, but you have to go up to the front of the restaurant to pay. Literally NO ONE around out front, but several people piddling around behind the wall in the kitchen area. We waited, and waited, and waited. Finally I asked one of the girls in the kitchen behind the wall by the register if they could PLEASE just take our payment for the drinks so we could get the hell out of there. It ended up being our waitress from before and she just jerked the ticket out of my hand and said \"don't worry about it\". We won't worry about it, and we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"A wet noodle graced my menu. The sweet tea was sour. The bread was tasteless and the marinara tasted like microwaved Ragu. The ranch was watered down for my brown lettuce salad. The shrimp was like rubber. This place is a hot mess."}
{"text":"You might as well get a can of Chef Boyardee.  The sauce taste like it's out of a jar. It's so easy to get fresh produce, I don't understand why restaurants insist on using caned and frozen produce and dried herbs, but charge as much as much as a restaurant in the city. 

Also, the service leaves something to be desired. When the waitress wasn't helping a table, she was sitting at another table in the dining room eating. He literally yelled across the room, \"can I get you anything?\"

I also saw a waitress pull a set of silverware off a table she had just cleaned after a couple of diners left..she inspected and decided it the silverware wasn't used, so she threw it back into bin at the front door, so it could be given to another table. How did she show the silverware wasn't dirty?"}
{"text":"Ended up sick after eating here. NEver again!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a Friday. The service was exceptional, as was the calzone I had. The dough they used was delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here tonight and enjoyed our meal! The complimentary breadsticks were fresh and tasty and my philly was great! My wife really enjoyed her calzone although a good portion of it had way more spinach than cheese or tomato.. the onion rings and special sauce are a nice change if you are tired of fries and the cheesecake is also outstanding! We will definitely be back to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"stumbled across the place with a friend of mine decided to try somewhere new she got Alfredo and I got a pizza so share with my daughter the bread sticks were awesome and the pizza was huge for the price! Alfredo was a little bland but it was good! would definitely return."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here tonight and really enjoyed it.  The server immediately offered us breadsticks with sauce that were yummy.  My family had a small pizza that my two girls shared, and didn't finish, a Stromboli, and some of their greek chicken.  I can say that it was all very fresh and tasty.  Our server Chelsea was very attentive, and made sure we had what we needed.  We ordered the strawberry shortcake for dessert, and this is the only thing that stood in the way of a 5 star rating.  I have a personal vendetta against the red goo used for strawberry shortcake, so it wasn't my fave.
We definitely have added this place to one of new favorite joints to go to for a quick, reasonably priced meal, where all of our tastes can be accommodated.  I think next time, I'll go with the homemade carrot cake!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stumbled upon this restaurant because it was the only thing open in downtown Mt Holly. We were pleasantly surprised with everything. The servers were very attentive and helped each other out, so we we're never without a drink or napkin. The food was fantastic. We got the fried zucchini, Greek salad and a spinach, chicken and mushroom pizza. We will definitely back to try some different entrees and to get some more delicious pizza. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I have eaten here on several occassions for breakfast, lunch and dinner and everything is delicious. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"We had dinner and the breadsticks were hot and fresh and plentiful. And it was the freshest salad I have had in years. No bagged salad here!  The pasta was very tasty and fresh and our waitperson exceptional. Thank you Brittany!! And thank you to all the friendly faces there! And the menu options were amazing and plentiful."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Big portions and reasonable priced. Service was a little slow. Would definitely be back again"}
