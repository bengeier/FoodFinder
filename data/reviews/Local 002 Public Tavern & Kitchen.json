{"text":"Except maybe for the pizza, great pub food. It tastes like it was made fresh, unlike about 90% of the pubs in this city.

Try the chili cheese fries - the chili is made with slow-cooked brisket and has some unique spices. Also try the burger with a fried egg.

The decor is trendy, but the clientele is more... yuppie? The kids from MRU don't seem to come here; too expensive."}
{"text":"Is there a 2.5 stars?  I've definitely had better...and definitely had worse.  It's also not A-ok..it's just \"ok\"...

Ok...

Food...ok
service...ok..ok..well the server was quite cute and ...well whatever...

will I be back?  I live close so more than likely.  

Been there a  couple times in the past year and it's definitely nicer than many pubs I've been too...grr.... see ... can't rave...can't complain...it's just there I guess."}
{"text":"I do really appreciate the fact that more and more pubs are allowing children in for meals and the 002 Tavern is no exception. However, if you allow children in please try to be a bit more accommodating  with menu items for them.  Many children 8 and under do not eat whole meals, they are picky, they like chicken finger and plain noodles, grilled cheese sandwiches or mini-pizzas. 

We went to the 002 last week with our 8 year old, she wanted plain noodles, I asked the waitress if they had just \"plain\" noodles as they did have macaroni and cheese on the menu for $14.50. She said she would ask what they could do, and lo and behold brought my daughter a bowl of  plain noodles, of which she ate exactly half. Then I saw I paid the full $14.50 for a bowl of plain noodles!!!  YIKES! 

Also disappointing, they were out of nachos! 

Personally, I think all the menu items are slightly over-priced for very average food. 

I had a burger and it was okay , but my fries were lukewarm. 

This is a local establishment for me so will probably return maybe just for beer and nachos ( if they have them in!)  and probably without our daughter, which simply means not as often."}
{"text":"Went here with our Groupon, 2 beers, an appy and 2 mains for 30$- which is an awesome deal because it isn't the cheapest pub food around.
After looking at the reviews I was nervous but it turned out great. We had the fried cheese appy, which was meh, but my BF liked it. He had the sausage mac and cheese and LOVED it, actually looked at his plate when he was done as wished for more. I had the steak and fries, fries were SO good, steak was.. good for a non-steakhouse.
The service was efficient, not the friendliest but I can't complain, we got all our orders fast and correct. The manager came out and said hi and chat- so that was nice.
All in all I would definitely come back...but probably to the 510 location since I spend a lot of time downtown."}
{"text":"Over-priced EVERYTHING. Worst $20 nachos (I think the meat jacked it up to that price) I've ever had. If I wanted a plate of tortilla chips with a smattering of cheese and some other light sprinkles of the usual nacho stuff, I'd do it at home.  Other than that, this place serves alcohol....so it's got THAT going for it.

I feel a bit rotten for being so negative.  So I'll also talk about some of the positives.  The dining room is pretty comfy.  And I tend to like the dark interior of the place.  The location is pretty convenient for the Mount Royal and Garrison folks. So you've got to take the good with the bad. But sometimes it's just not enough that a place is CLOSE BY and dark enough to not get too warm, y'know?"}
{"text":"Not bad. Specials are ok. Menu is very basic.  Wings are lacking in taste and substance.  The beer is good and cold.  Good thing considering Local 002 caters to the MRU crowd. Eventually that demographic will be sucked dry of $ spent on their onsite bank machine fees since they don't accept Interac....Really?!  In 2010...cmon!"}
{"text":"I love the Local Taverns dotted around town--but what makes this one a stand out is that it's the closest to my homebase.  A bit of a departure from my favourite Local--Local 510--what with all the televisions around, it does sport a terrific communal table and the same great interior design touches that distinguish the Local Taverns as comfortable places for folks from nearly all walks of life to gather for a can of Steam Whistle and some terrific meatloaf!"}
{"text":"The service was okay, not great. I never got a refill on my water, although they were more than happy to refill the pop of the person that I was with. I had a macaroni and sausage dish, it was incredibly tasty. Although, because it was SO heavy with butter and cream, I could only eat a little bit of it before feeling very sick, and the salad of the person I was with was soggy."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on Sunday with a few friends. It wasn't busy which was nice, got a table and they had good sports on (skiing), eventually got bumped due to soccer, which is lame. Ah well. 

I went the granola which was so good. Tons of yummy fruit, yogurt, hemp seed and other goodies. Steve had the wings, which he said were good. 

Service was perfect, didn't come around too often, but enough to make sure you were content. Price was decent, could get food cheaper, but it was good. 

Random area, is probably it's downfall, other than uni kids heading there."}
{"text":"Don't bother with Brunch. If there was 0/5 on the 'yelpichter' scale it would have been deployed for this occasion.
On 12/12th/2010 we visited in celebration of a family birthday - boy, was I disappointed as I had overridden another's suggestion for brunch location. Let me start with that I had visited this location on 3 other occasions for lunch which were avg. at best and I thought breakfast - how can you mess this up. Well, it was messed over and over and....you get my point.
For starters 3/5 meals arrived at the table missing described components of their described entirety...tortillas, compote and hash. The meal delivery person was the young female bartender who appeared to be put out that what was delivered was not acceptable to our party.
Further to incorrect components - not one meal was \"hot\" most were barely warm. Upon identifying the shortfalls and disappointment the server took back 2/5 meals for redo...we should have saved our time as redo was slightly better but overall 1/10 on expectation.
The resolution and feel good for the staff was to take one meal off the check and slide in (3) 10% coupons for \"next time\". Very presumptuous that there will be a 'next time'. As on my other posts - Local 002 will now join my embargo list which means I (we) will never attend again AND I will make sure I tell everyone about my poor experience so they avert what I have experienced already.
Even though it is a buffet and can be busy - the Carriage House Inn on Macleod & 90th SE has a kick ass brunch product AND you serve yourself!"}
{"text":"Local 002, what is it with you? I like your sister locations, 510 and 522... my Ultimate Frisbee team and I were looking for a spot to go after our final game of the season. A few other spots in the area were too full for our group of 12, so we figured we'd give it a shot.

We walked in and there were plenty of tables available. So far so good. And drink specials too! Pints of any Molson product (Rickard's included) for $4.62 and all appys (except the nachos) are on for $7.02 every Tuesday. Not bad, not bad. 

The menu here is the same as the menu at 510, but it's funny how different a bar can feel in a different part of the city. This one is right close to MRU and feels far more like a sports bar with all of the TVs around than a cool local hangout... except for the moose head hanging on the wall.

The service during our visit was a-ok. Our server was on top of filling up our drinks, taking our orders, etc. One thing she could've improved upon was repeating some of the specials at the other end of the table. The first half heard them and but we were too big a group to over hear what she was saying, yet had duplicate questions.

The beer was also a-ok. The selection isn't great, but it's alright. While my cohorts enjoyed their Molson products, I opted for a Steamwhistle. It's not on tap, but the Tallboy can is the same amount as a pint, and the server even brought me a nice cold glass to go with it.

The food was a different story. It wasn't at all slow coming out, but the beef tacos I ordered where cold and the smallest tacos I've ever seen! And it only came with 3 of them. Don't order them. My teammate got the chicken tacos and it was the exact same thing. Cold and tiny. I tried another teammate's chili cheese fries. They came in a nice big bowl and were adequately covered in meat and cheese. I didn't hear any complaints about the calamari, nachos and wings being shared at the other end of the table either, although the plate of nachos looked small for $15 or so dollars.

So, if you're in the area, you're safe ordering a few of the appys. Stay away from the tacos. Also, make sure you've got cash or credit on you. Local 002 doesn't take debit. Though I usually take off a star for places taking credit and not debit that have a bank machine on site (I think it's a skizzy money grabbing practice... yes, skizzy. A combination of sketchy, scummy, greedy, etc.), Local 002 only has their fee set at $1.50. That's the lowest one I've seen in Calgary... and overall it certainly doesn't deserve a 1-star IMO."}
{"text":"The service here is so bad that at least 4 times we've gone in, sat ourselves at a high top, and been ignored for more than 15 minutes so we've left. It's the only bar in our neighborhood for now, so we go back, but it's THE WORST SERVICE!!! Often times we'll look around the bar for our server and notice there are numerous tables with empty drinks. It's like these servers don't even want to make money!!!

On the other hand the food isn't bad. I like their wings, the muscles, and the fried cheese."}
{"text":"I eat here on a somewhat regular basis, either with my wife or my curling team. I read the reviews on here, and didn't quite understand what a lot of people were on about. I looked at the dates, and some of them are going back a bit (early 2010), and that is about when they switched owners, so maybe that had something to do with the negatives.

I have never had a bad meal here, and the food is always fresh, hot and presented well. I don't know what one reviewer meant by 'not much variety' on the menu. It certainly isn't a Moxie's five-page tome or anything, but certainly enough to cover all the bases, and this is a bar/restaurant, not just a restaurant. And, if you want a kids menu, go to Dennys. Why people think a bar is a good place for a child baffles me. I will grant, however, that some items on the menu are a little overpriced.


The service is the only thing I could possibly fault with the restaurant. It sometimes suffers from the 'disappearing server' disease that affects some restaurants. However, even with that, everyone is very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.

A nice, south-facing, patio and more than ample parking. If you're lucky, you will get to see the fire department getting deployed from their station across the street.

Beer selection is good, more TVs than you care to watch, clean, warm and looks good. You really couldn't do much better for a higher-end neighborhood pub."}
