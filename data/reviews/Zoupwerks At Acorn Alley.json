{"text":"Overall this restaurant is very good, their soups are obviously made from scratch and you get a reasonable portion for the price. The only room for improvement here is they need to raise the temperature of the steam trays as it seems every time I eat here the soup is just slightly above lukewarm.   The sandwiches are also good but a bit expensive for what you get, and they tend to overdo the onion (unless you like a lot of red onion on your sandwich.)   My biggest complaint is their beverage service - awhich consists of a cooler stocked with cans of soda and bottles of water that are $1 each. They also have strategically placed signs throughout the dining area advertising the fact that \"by order of the Kent health department water cannot be served to customers from a sink that is used to wash dishes.\" Maybe I've just been spoiled by practically every other food serving establishment offering refills on their drink service, but it seems to me that it's a slap in the face to customers to not even offer a pitcher of water. My suggestion would be BYOB."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant was such a nutcase, he drove the business in the ground before one person even wrote a review on Yelp.....wow!  I have heard that the soup was sometimes good, but mostly so-so.    Throughout the year or so that this business was open, the owner insulted the citizens of Kent repeatedly on his Facebook page and in the comments sections of local newspapers.  He also routinely publicly berated his employees.    Near the end, the owner parked a box truck in front of the neighboring business's drive-thru window on purpose to prevent customers from ordering.  When he was asked to move the truck by a juvenile employee, he made enough vulgar remarks for the police to charge him with disorderly conduct when they arrived.  He plead guilty to the charge.  Around the same time, he was sued by a former employee for non-payment of wages.  The course judged in the employee's favor and he was ordered to pay back wages.    A chronicle of the rise and fall of this business would make a great case-study about what not to do in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Funky Ladles is easily one of the best places to go for lunch in Kent. The lobster bisque is pure heaven, but I almost always order the triple shot. The workers are ok, nothing special but I don't go there to be schmoozed. You get a ginormous hunk of bread with your soup and get to sit there, enjoy the memorabilia and listen to some sweet classic rock while you're munching  The food is great, not too expensive, and the tunes rock! Perfect for a winter day in snowy Kent, OH."}
{"text":"Yummy soup. I had a lobster bisque with tomatoes and spinach, my husband had a trio of vegan spicy bean soup,pork and BLUEBERRIES! and matzo ball and our little ones enjoyed the mac and cheese. The bisque was JAMMED full of lobster, it was very rich and I really liked it. My husband liked all of them the vegan one was nice and spicy, the pork one was full of all kinds of veggies and only really had a hint of blueberry flavor and the  matzo was the only one he didn't fully enjoy. It was the balls he said were blah.   The reason for the 4 not 5 stars was the price, 2 sm. mac & cheese, 1 bowl, one combo, 3 cans of pop and a gigantic brownie was $25!! I am not saying give it away (and I was FULL), but jeeze!   Final verdict:  we will be back!"}
{"text":"Even though there are plenty of other lunch choices in Kent, Zoupwerks brings its own unique, groovy flavour to the Kent-ites. Zoupwerks is a new addition to the downtown Kent family, and especially to the new Acorn Alley II retail addition. Before I get to the actual food review, a huge kudos goes to the Kent State University and Kent local officials for rejuvenating downtown Kent with great new small businesses to frequent as well as a makeover on Main Street. All of this construction and traffic on Main/Water/Haymaker Pkwy will pay off, I assure you.   I have been to Zoupwerks 2 times already, but I have only had soup each time. Zoupwerks offers more than just soup including sandwiches and salads. Both soups were tasty, made with fresh ingredients like your grandma makes them, and come with a side of thick bread. I've had the meaty italian minestrone and wedding soup, both of which were excellent. I can already tell I will be coming back many times during my grad school tenure. ;)"}
{"text":"Funky Ladles is definitely my favorite place to grab lunch on a cold afternoon in Kent!  They've always got a wonderful choice of soups and (even though I'm picky with soups) I can always choose one to enjoy. They've also got sandwiches to enjoy.  On Fridays they have mac & cheese-- always a good pick!  My recommendation: Don't settle for just one soup-- try the triple shot! 3 different types of soup for you to try! Also, add a big brownie. Super yummy and cheap!"}
{"text":"it's cute, it has vegan options, they stayed open just cause we came in late. it's a needed addition to kent. i would only suggest that they stay open later, and not clean while people are in there eating... the cleaning products they used smelled so strong it was like you could taste it. but otherwise, def give it a try. if i was a student, it'd be a staple i'm sure."}
