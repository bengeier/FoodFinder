{"text":"Nice place, great menu. Portion was very small for price. Tried the acai bowl that should be called the banana bowl as it contains very little acai. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I work in the area, went to grab a hearty bowl for lunch. The service was excellent, was offered a complimentary smoothie sample while I waited too! Place was clean and service was quick. It IS a little on the pricier side, but your're paying for good quality ingredients prepared fresh, so it's warranted. The food was delicious, amazing flavour, tasting dressing, chicken was moist and there was a lot of it. 
I would def. go back (but too expensive to go too often)."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find healthy options in Liberty but this was a total bust. Firstly the bowl with chicken came to 20.70, that's right. It cost an additional 6 dollars to add protein which was a precooked half chicken breast, not even a full piece. I almost handed it right back when they gave it to me but figured I should try it first. The rice was totally dry, there was a few veggies thrown in, not enough sauce for the bowl and none of it was warm. Total ripoff considering the quality of places like IQ and more friendly Freshii. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"This place specializes in smoothies and salads.

Pros
- Food ready pretty fast
- They use Ritual App which is convenient
- Focus on vegan/gluten free options if you are into that. But they do have the option to add meat.

Cons
- Too expensive. I got the \"Mayan Crunch\" quinoa/salad bowl with chicken, it came to $20. You can get the same bowl type food at Oni Poke Bowl or Freshii, both in Liberty Village, both cheaper, both taste better. You know sometimes the quality is so good you don't mind over paying? Their quality did not justify being more expensive than their competitors.
- Chicken was okay, I was disappointed it was not freshly cooked, it's the type of already made chicken they have sitting in a fridge all day.
- Unless you live in Liberty Village, good luck finding this place, it's hidden.

Summary
- Food was alright, but for your money, you can get better, cheaper versions of this place nearby."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this one star rating is for the service/experience I received during a busy lunch hour today. I live in the neighbourhood and have often stopped in for a late weekend lunch or picked up a juice on the way to work and for that, Garden Gangsters has been good. 

Weekday lunch today, however was completely chaotic! This rating refers to that and is a warning if you are hoping to stop by during your lunch hour to grab a tasty and healthy lunch then you should turn around!!!! You will leave feeling annoyed and stressed by the experience in addition to paying an exorbitant amount for the food. 

It felt like the majority of people working this busy rush period were all brand new with no one seemingly in charge. Ritual and pick up orders were being mistaken / confused with in-person orders and everything was taking  excruciatingly long. Workers who were on the pass were moving so slowly as if in slow motion staring at the chit, looking back at the menu screens, double checking ingredients and STILL making mistakes causing them to have to re-start orders. It was painful watching and waiting, no exaggeration 30 minutes for ONE salad bowl. 

That said, this salad bowl is one of my favourites which is why I was excited to make the trek over on a sunny day. Taste-wise, it measured up to all the other times I'd eaten it but by the time I finally got it, I was so bummed out that I didn't even enjoy it :( $20.00 for a large healthy salad and a water bottle plus the annoyance of the experience just left a really bad taste. 

Bummed....."}
{"text":"Good quality, fresh ingredients and a nice variety of healthy bowls on the menu. I haven't tried any of the beverages yet, but they look just as good. The problem is the price! It's expensive here and the portions are small for the price - especially if you want to add protein. I hope the ingredients are organic... For the price, you're probably better off going down the street to Live Organic or even Freshii."}
{"text":"The food is fine. They have some good salad combos and I do like their ingredients. They have a steak salad which is great, with great quality steak. My issue with this place is the price. They have a smoothie that costs 20 dollars!!!! Lol!  Now this may be an Uber Eats price, but regardless, I find it atrocious. The nerve and gall of the business owner to allow a price point for a smoothie to be 20 dollars just actually makes me angry for some reason. Everything on their menu is completely jacked up in price which makes it hard for me to stomach this place. I've never seen prices so high in comparable restaurants."}
{"text":"piggy backed on Ritual here for a Deep Roots cold pressed juice....very delicious, cool, refreshing, and flavorful. 

Juice quality is there. Price for the juice is expensive considering the amount...but understandable considering the fresh ingredients needed.

Afraid to order salads after seeing all the reviews...may try the West Coast Thrill"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but I just didn't enjoy the food. Great concept, great service and great location... but it was unfortunate the rice was dry, the egg over cooked, tofu tastes like cardboard. I will give this place again and maybe order something else. But this particular dish was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and lunch bowls. Staff were super friendly and offered sample juices. Prices were on the pricier side - a little above the prices from Freshii. Restaurant aesthetics were on point."}
{"text":"Second time ordering a Mayan Crunch bowl.  I declined the most expensive ingredient (Monterey Jack cheese) to make it vegan. I ordered extra avocado (but they didn't even give the usual allotment) and mushrooms. They put extra lettuce to make up for the cheese, which isn't cool. The salad bowl was over $30 with tax. Ludicrous. I enjoyed the smoothie I got but $50 for a tiny tasteless vegan salad with no cashew cream or nut product along with a drink is what I call a rip off. A similar salad that tastes way better is available at Impact for half the price. 

This place is aptly named. I order from here only in emergency situations."}
{"text":"Overpriced for an average salad. You can be a garden gangsters too - all you have to do is buy your produce from Metro."}
{"text":"Garden Gangsters is my absolute favorite healthy eats place! They specialize in fast healthy meals. The space is located right by St. Lawrence Market, there is plenty of seating as well as patio seating. Now moving on to the food. 

The salads are insane! My go-to salad is the Mayan Crunch and the Market Stash. The Mayan Crunch has quinoa, greens, avocado, corn + black bean salsa, pico de gallo, green onions, cheese and corn crisps. The Market Stash has quinoa, greens, butternut squash, apple, spiced pecans, goat cheese and balsamic dressing. 

I would go with the chicken as my form of protein, it is so flavorful and has a nice spice to it. It is a bit pricey for salad but in my opinion 100% worth it. 

Check out my picture! 

Keep Eating,

{"text":"Incredibly overpriced. 

$24+ for a small salad bowl with chicken. Food was alright but not worth the price. It was grilled chicken with tiny portions of avocado, pico, quinoa, corn and cheese. No cooking involved, just assembly of above mentioned ingredients over a bed of greens. I probably won't return as I can make 12 such bowls for $24 (think No Frills not Metro...lol!). 

But yeah ...... save your money friends and buy dividend paying stocks instead.  

I didn't order one but smoothies were $15+. I saw quite a few people come in for a smoothie and then leave muttering that $15 was too much for one. Management should consider reducing prices if they want to stay in business."}
{"text":"Pretty G... as in Good. Not quite gangsta.

DELIVERY REVIEW: Ordered via UberEATS

For a salad, Garden Gangster is on the pricey side, especially since the base bowl doesn't include any protein and requires you to add-on. Then when you add on the delivery and item charges, you're looking at $40 for a salad and a smoothie. 

Seoul Kicker + Tofu Add On (4/5)

- a sort of salad that's basically a Korean bibimbap with some spinach at the bottom
- ingredients were fresh (I hate when spinach or other leaves in salad is shriveled or bruised) 

Green Charger Smoothie (3/5)

- good consistency, and saran wrapped for delivery

Honestly, I can't say anything bad per se about the food but it didn't win me over. Given the price, it wouldn't be my go-to salad place but I'd return to give their other salads a go."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 10 times since they've opened and all my experiences have been great! The food is super tasty and everyone who works there is very nice and accommodating. 

So far I've had:
- the market stash salad (my favourite), with or without protein but the chicken and tempeh are great
- the blueberry overnight oats were also very good
- the green charger smoothie

I've liked everything so far and I regularly make it a lunch go-to spot and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Ordered via Uber Eats... Super pricey, but also delicious! Had the Mayan Crunch, which I enjoyed thoroughly. Fresh ingredients, good quality. Adequate portion size which makes it feel that much 'healthier'. This type of restaurant would fit under the stereotype of 'healthy food is expensive' as this was SUPER expensive for a small meal. Garden gangsters' branding is brilliant."}
{"text":"The best salad place ever. It is bit expensive. I usually guy the Milo which is 13.99 but the taste is so indulging. The handmade juice is to die for"}
{"text":"It's really disappointing to spend $25 after jacked up online pricing then not even receive the dressing. Was excited to order online because we don't get the new menu items at the st Lawrence market location, but they weren't online. Disappointed with how this business has forgotten about their long term customers who have been coming since before the huge name change expansion."}
{"text":"I am not one to complain or write reviews, but one of my favourite places has just taken a huge downhill. Used to go in all the time for lunch and to chat with some of the employees. Dan knew my name and I really enjoyed how personal the experience was. Then they expanded. I almost stopped coming due to the completely new menu and drastic price increases, but had a great experience dealing with the new manager and decided to give it another chance. Then he was fired. Then met a new manager, he's gone too. Not sure what's happening but the staff is constantly changing and seem unhappy, there's constantly missing menu items, and i no longer feel like I'm supporting a small business when I come in. This business is on the downhill, I wouldn't recommend supporting."}
{"text":"This place is great! I wish more people knew about it as it's hidden in the pathway in Liberty Village. The food is fresh, healthy and delicious and the people who work here are phenomenal and really kind. Their avocado smash is my favourite :)

Five stars to this gem!!!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place and I want to see non-chain restaurants succeed, but my experience left a lot to be answered for. 

Arrived with a friend at 12, and our meals arrived at 12:35. People behind us in line were served first. There were two instances where servers tried to give us a Ritual meal. After making the wrong meal for my friend they offered her steak instead of chicken and then revoked the offer and took it out of her hands. My veggie salad had still not arrived. When it did the tempeh was well done, not all bad, but the salad barely made the half way mark in the bowl. The amount of dressing was tiny for the kale within. 

Once the staff caught their breath after the lunch rush, they visited our table to ask how everything was. A nice gesture, but it was too cringeworthy a moment to tell them how bad the experience was. 

My salad was nearly $18 and I was hungry by 2pm. Sadly, just another place \"cashing in on kale\", with overpriced salads. I won't even get started on the protein pricing...

Won't be back."}
