{"text":"Great place for dessert in a cute atmosphere! There are always new and interesting options (with unusual flavors like passionfruit and matcha in addition to classics like chocolate). I particularly like the layered pudding/parfait things, which I haven't seen anything similar to at other bakeries.   The owner is a pastry chef from paris, and she's always super friendly and excited to tell you about the desserts!"}
{"text":"I went into this place as I wanted to try some of their amazing Vegan baking. On my list to try were the donuts, lemon meringue pie and their vegan hot chocolate.   It is very hard to find parking although on the street ! But it is worth it. The decor is very original and super cute ! I loved how they had ledges along the windows with pillows, which would be a great place for kids to chill. Also their are children activities and books as well.   The prices are decent for a vegan place I paid $35 but left with a good assortment of vegan baking and she let me have a try of the vegan hot chocolate.   For my fellow vegans this place is legit, plant based, gluten free etc. Worth checking out if your in the area !"}
{"text":"L'accueil est très chaleureux, on sent l'amour que Marie Charlotte met dans ses créations. C'est un challenge de faire des patisseries créatives vegan sans gluten et faible en sucre! Celle chocolat- citron était juste sublime parfaitement équilibrée et rafinée. Par contre celle framboise-mangue avait un texture étrange et les goûts se superposaient sans harmonie. Je conseillerais de repenser celle là. Dernier petit bémol pour le matcha tiède-froid qui avait un goût moyennement agréable. Mais c'était la première semaine. Je veux juste encourager à améliorer et pofiner les recettes! Je souhaite longue vie à ce lieux cute. (D'autres tables ou on pourrait venir travailler et déguster en m?me temps serait le fun ;))"}
{"text":"These pastries are AMAZING! Whether you're vegan or not, I can guarantee that you'll love whatever you get. I got the chocolate tarte and a coconut (I can't recall exactly) energy ball, and they were both SO GOOD! Also, the place is so adorable and unique! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Everything here looks and sounds delightful!! I treated myself to a frappe of housemade coconut milk with ginger and mango. Great amount of ginger, I can feel a teeny burn. The taste is soooo gooood. I taste real flavors!! That's important to me. And lovely service too: lots of smiles!! I want another treat here very soon!! The little stickers on the cups are a lurvely touch. And the Towely on the wall... so me!!"}
{"text":"Be still my aspirationally-veggie heart! To sit in these big windows looking out on cobblestone Duluth and eat this perfect tart and impossibly vegan lemon custard meringue and drink the house-infused sweet cranberry green tea is just such an afternoon delight.   The owner is a total love, so enthusiastic about what she does you can't help but wish her everything good! And I love how quirky chill the place is decorated. Do twin organists ever duel it out on the matching old instruments? We can dream.   I know spots on this strip are expensive so I hope she can draw in enough customers to rock the rent this big location must require. I feel like vegan kiddo birthday parties could do well here? Anyway we tried a bunch and will definitely pass by for more whenever I'm nearby! Go say hi!"}
{"text":"If I did not know this was vegan with no sugar added I couldn't tell the difference. Excellent products and a lovely atmosphere in a great location. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"I love love loooove Dugout! Their cute deserts brighten my day! They crush the stigma that vegan food tastes like cardboard. Their deserts are so imaginative and varied in flavors and they are just the right size for a sweet treat, but I can't lie, I could eat a whole box of 10 in one seat hahaha"}
{"text":"This rainbow-themed psychedelic vegan cafe is new to the Duluth neighbourhood, but you won't be able to miss it - there's nothing else like it in the area!  Everything here is not only vegan but also hand-made by the owner every morning, and she was so kind and accommodating and friendly when I visited.   The decor is a lot - bright pink, clashing colours, old keyboards, disco lights and wallpaper made of a sort of late-90s-internet-style poster wall. It sounds distracting but it's honestly quite pleasant, because it's clearly been put together with purpose!  I ordered the rose & mint tea, which was beautifully perfumed and floral, and the passion fruit meringue, which was fruity without being overly tart, and had lovely, chewy, pillowy meringue on top. I'm not entirely sure how it was vegan! It's amazing!  The only problem I had with this place was the tables, which were either coffee tables or tall bar tables. I sat at the coffee table and I felt like a giant, having to bend down to eat my meringue!  But seriously, this place deserves to be busier than it is. It has a lot of personality and love poured into it, and it's certainly unique. I really feel like it represents the personality of Duluth: bizarre and weird and eclectic as hell."}
{"text":"Envie de sucré dans un endroit atypique et original ? N'allez pas plus loin DUGOUT est le café idéal pour ça ! Tout est bon et fait maison.  Très contente d'avoir découvert cette place où je retournerai c'est sûr"}
{"text":"Gosh this place is pretty. The decor, which seems like soft pastel femme aesthetic just exploded all over a big-windowed room, sets the tone for the whole experience. The owner explained to us that before opening the space she just started accumulating thrift store items and started painting them pink- the result was DUGOUT.  Space aside, the pastries are lovely. My strictly vegan companions found the fruity meringue pastries a little sweet for their taste but I thought they were perfect, and I'm used to eggy versions.  For the time being the selection is a little limited but the place is very new and it seems to generally be a (wonder) one-woman show. So no hating. Additionally she mentioned that she's hoping to get some savoury items up on the board in coming months which should be tasty AF.  I'm very stoked to have a new (woman-owned) vegan bakery to frequent, highly recommend!"}
