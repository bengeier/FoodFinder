{"text":"Happy to see the restaurant not using one time use chopsticks, more ECO friendly.   The location is good. But just a bit confusing about the parking, I was not sure if there's reserved parking spots for customers. I went in and asked the host, and he let me park at the right side ( a tiny area ) of the front door.   The food was good and nice presentation. I love the hamachi and tuna (albacore tuna, ocean wise sustainable tuna) sushi, very good quality! Seared salmon and scallop were very good too!  Will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner. The food was delicious-decent portions, fresh and very flavorful. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable, the food's great, and the sake is even better.  To a person who truly appreciates the presentation and art of Japanese cuisine. Definitely check this place out if you want to try some great Japanese food!   As far as I know, new renovation and owner."}
{"text":"Small, quiet, in a part of Kensington/Hillhurst I don't frequently go, and shit for parking... HOWEVER - the service A++. The food, very good. Unique presentation - we had a 'lotus' built out of something edible as part of the set up of our sushi rolls. The fresh tasty salmon sashimi, was separated in it's own bowl on ice, not just in a lonely corner on the large plate with our rolls. Hopefully this artistry  doesn't drop off anytime soon if they were to get uber popular. Service - Adorable. It's kind of weird to say the service is adorable but it was. The owner (I assume?) was cute as a bug, very attentive, not bothersome, made some great recommendations, and even apologized for not being more attentive (which wasn't the case). All in all I will go back more than once, and probably more than twice. The prices are very good, and you don't have to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"I've been going here for about a year now and it is still the best sushi place I've been too. The staff is always friendly and accommodating and the food is amazing. I suggest trying the Mexican rolls, they are my all time favorite. The only thing they are missing is bottled water."}
{"text":"Red Ember, a quite Japanese sushi restaurant located on 14th Street NW.   I've always wanted to try something new when it comes to sushi besides any AYCE location and Li-Ao (located in Bridlewood SW) so I took the liberty to see what people have reviewed on Yelp and here I am.   I checked on Facebook for their menu and was so stoke to try their 44 piece Party Tray A for $35 but when I got there I was upset because they don't offer that anymore so I got their Sushi & Sashimi combo instead since it was similar but a lot cheaper. Keep in mind that I've only been to AYCE sushi and Li-Ao so what I experience there is really different from what I experienced in Red Ember. The sushi and nigiri was fine but when it came to the sashimi I was like \"what is this\" and \"why is my portion massive while my salmon sashimi is tiny?\" But nevertheless I enjoyed it. Yes I know the server explained what each individual roll and sashimi was presented but I think I wasn't paying attention but I was starring at the sashimi and questioning the size.   The only downside is that the service was slower than usual and parking was such a hassle. I just notice you can park at the back instead of parking 3 blocks down on 14th since at the time I went the parkade machine was out of service. It's unfortunate that there's no street parking.  Red Ember is a great place to dine if you're tired or want to try something different. A definite +1 in my books and would love to visit again in the near future."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are packed with rice and very little fish in the middle.  The crispy tuna roll is 70 % rice and batter with very little fish and there's no taste of any spicy sauce.  This place is over rated."}
{"text":"Im not a fan of  the decor at Red Ember..its  odd, and the shape of the place skewed...but WHO CARES...the sushi is amazing. I love that they have different rolls from the usual ho -hum. The specialty rolls are around the $15 dollar mark, but make up for it in size and originality of flavours. On top of that the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We go to this place on a fairly regular basis as it's the best sushi in Calgary we've found so far. The fish quality and rolls rarely disappoint and the black cod appetizer is particularly tasty. Also a good selection of cooked foods if you're dining with people who don't like raw.  Two things to note: they only have one highchair (!) so call ahead to ensure it's available if you're depending on it, and the restaurant parking advertised on the sandwich board out front refers to the space immediately to the right of the front door. An employee's yellow Porsche is usually parked there but one can shoehorn next to it instead of paying in the building's parkade."}
{"text":"Went near the end of March, and they recently opened. Taking over Sushi Kai 609's location, newly renovated with new owners and new staff. However, the appearance and presentation of the nigiris, rolls, and sashimi is pretty similar to Sushi Kai's.   The staff started us off with a small taster; it was a small piece of tempura. The batter wasn't overly thick, it wasn't too dry, and it wasn't oily either. You can taste the fish through the tempura batter.  Yam Tempura   The batter was thin but it was more oily than I would like. It was cooked perfectly, wasn't mushy, nor was it under-cooked.   Assorted Nigiri and Rolls     This is where it reminds me of Sushi Kai a lot, the tall, narrow pieces of roll and having all the nigiris and rolls on one plate. Nothing was bad about it, but it was average. The toro wasn't fatty enough though. The saba was also very marinated, just like Sushi Kai's. so you can't taste the fishy-ness that saba has.  Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream  Went for the tempura green tea ice cream and I found that the green tea was a little light. The owner told us that they purposely had someone customize the ice cream to incorporate lemon into it. You can taste the lemon and green tea, but it wasn't too strong.   Overall, I did like Red Ember, but it wouldn't be the first place I think of for sushi. I like it also because it reminded me of Sushi Kai (prior to AYEC)."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a night out with friends. We decided on Red Ember base on the reviews!  We were not disappointed and so happy we took a chance to go to this new-to-us place. Our table ordered a variety:  various nigiri, fun rolls (Mexican and volcano), donburi, appies, and even tried the deep fried ice cream dessert!  All the food was fresh, delicious, and well presented. Service was good - never felt rushed. Great atmosphere and reasonably priced. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Great Environment!  Service on point!! My new favorite!! Try it, you won't be disappointed!!  Sashi is fresh, on ice.  Large pieces!! Tempura was so crispy.  Best I've had."}
{"text":"Really as good as it gets. The sashimi was as good as I have had. Thick slices, great chefs selection served over a bed of ice. Also had a rainbow roll, which was equally good.   For the appetizers we had miso black cod. It was juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection. The place was quiet and you could easily carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Mycket god sushi. Mycket mat och väldigt god! Avslappnad atmosfär men kan bli mycket folk vid populära tider. Säkrast är att boka bord i förväg eller beställa take away.   Restaurangen har ett stort utbud av många japanska rätter med öppet kök så man ser hela processen från start till slut.   +1 för personalen också, mycket trevliga."}
{"text":"While we were visiting Calgary, my son had sore throat, and the only thing he would eat was miso soup. So we yelped for Japanese place, and that's how we ended up in Red Ember. It was a little hassle to find parking space, but the food was great! We were there for lunch, and there were many options on lunch menu. My husband got chicken teriyaki and some sashimi, and I got beef udon. Also we ordered grasshopper roll (not sure if this is correct name), and everything was sooooo good. I would definitely visit again when I am in Calgary."}
{"text":"Das beste Sushi, dass ich bisher in Calgary hatte!! Super lecker! Sehr große Fischstücke auf den Nigiri, wenig Reis der auch nicht zu salzig ist und alles sehr frisch. Der Service ist freundlich und sehr zuvorkommend! Man bekommen eine kleinen Gruß aus der Küche während man auf sein essen wartet. Die Einrichtung ist gemütlich und es gibt auch Tische für größere Gruppen. Die geben sich wirklich viel Mühe um das Essen sowohl ansehnlich als auch schmackhaft zu machen. Absolut empfehlenswert! Das Restaurant hat einen eigenen Parkplatz, Zugang ist links vom Restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the Sushi and Sashimi here (although let's face it, it's still Sushi and Sashimi in Calgary and not some coastal city like Vancouver, but I digress...) - It remains one of my favorites, and the fact that it is a short walk north of Kensington on the west side of 14th doesn't hurt!  The lunch specials provide excellent value for money, and won't leave you feeling hungry at the end of the meal.  I find that for many restaurant it is difficult to be good with both take-out and eat-in.  This especially applies to Japanese cuisine where care must be taken in the presentation in the dining area, but separate but equally important steps must be taken to ensure that your take-out items maintain their quality when you wish to consume it at a later point in time.  Many take-out oriented sushi joints are, to be frank, a little light in the ambiance department.  Red Ember does a great job on both counts, something that I have grown to appreciate.  Tucked away in an unassuming red brick building, there is parking for those who have to take more than a walk to get here..."}
{"text":"Since reading John M'sreview I've been coming here 4 or 5 times a week. As you all know, Sushi is not the cheapest way to dine--for that, I say stay home.   Sushi. These guys go that extra mile, and so while they are not the bottom dollar cheapest place, you'll be glad you paid a couple extra bucks. I interrogated chef Calvin regarding why his octopus is actually tasty, instead of flavourless and rubbery. I won't divulge his secret, but let me say he is aware of the problem, and he's solved it! So it is with other dishes. They do the standards with a difference, and they do their own funky fushions too.   This sushi is exquisite! Don't worry about bankrupcy-- there is no sticker shock. There IS palate shock! Come, enjoy.. (i say \"come\" because I'm here for the 4th time in a week right now)."}
{"text":"Red ember is the best sushi place I have had in Calgary, always fresh, very friendly service, very clean and welcoming, lots of menu options to choose from and everything always tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"Forget ember, this place should be called Red Gem. It's a real gem. The quality of raw fish is high and consistent. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is nice for a date or a group. I really enjoy the sake don here, the fish is fresh and the value is high. I think I'm here with my girlfriend at least once a month. Please come and support this business! I don't want it to disappear like sushi club K."}
{"text":"I made sure to order their salmon tempura. Delicious! Beware, this is not for the faint of heart if you don't like garlic. They gave us a complimentary sample of tempura zucchini, which was very good. I'm really liking this place. The only downside is the inconvenience of finding parking.  They serve good portions for their rice bowls and sushi. Great service. If you're going to globefish on 14th st, consider walking down a bit further to try this place."}
{"text":"Ate here about 30 minutes before closing. Decorations were nice but I was disappointed by the paper liner. The menu was literally paper that's clearly been wet before. Ordered this scallop with tuna roll which was very satisfying and the price was justified. Friend ordered teriyaki beef bowl which was also very good. Lastly, ordered chicken kaarage which was different from what I usually see. Service was decent at most. Could have been four stars if it wasn't for the paper liner. I only expect that out of cheap Chinese restaurants but I guess I was wrong. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such high reviews. We came here before a ballet and were very underwhelmed by the rolls.   The service was good at the start but it actually took a really long time to get our sushi and it wasn't even busy at that time.  When the rolls did come out I found them to be boring with way too much rice, a couple even had 3 layers and the tiniest piece of meat or whatever it was inside.   Boo Urns."}
{"text":"Quality sushi and generous portions. Appreciate the presentation of the sushi and can tell the chef really cares about his food. We ordered assorted tempura, salmon sashimi, special scallop sushi, salmon aburi, the flames roll and the volcano roll. With tax and tip for two people it came out to $34/each which I would say is on par with other sushi restaurants. We went on a Friday night and every table was reserved. You could tell as people came in that they were regulars and the staff treated them as if they were family. Great place and would definitely recommend to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Mexican Rolls tasty small place parking can be a challenge but defiantly worth finding a place to try this place....FRESH!"}
{"text":"Only experienced Red Ember's takeout services, but impressive!  Their sushi was delicious! We tried a whole variety of rolls, and honestly none disappointed! I especially liked trying some rolls I have never had before, like the one with seaweed and squid. Very light and tasty!  Their tempura deserves a mention.. Perfectly battered and delicious. Their veggie tempura is amazing.  They made sure everything was labelled correctly on the boxes, so that shows that they are diligent!   The restaurant in itself was pretty, so I must return for a sit down meal!   Review #17 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Overall a really nice restaurant with good food. Service was really friendly and food was tasty. Criticism is the tempura had that slight taste of old oil. First time visitors there and would come back. The udon beef was nothing amazing but was comforting and would order again. Place was very clean and modern decor was pleasing. Solid 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Best selection east of the pacific coast. Red ember roll is a must.mexican roll too. Lots of others to choose from.But i keep coming back for the friendly service and ocean fresh sashimi with vancouver sized portions. The absolute best in ALL of the prairies!"}
{"text":"November Challenge - 24/30  What a great place to pick up some noms on the way to Chris' Cat Paradise! Generous portions and sensible prices, I really loved their Yam Tempura Roll and their Veggie Tempura was scrumtralescent. Each roll comes with six pieces, so between the four of us it came to about $20 each for some cozy fatassery.   We only got takeout, but from the looks of it, we'll have to come back for a proper sit-down dinner! Elegant decor, friendly staff that were super diligent about making sure my veggie rolls were separate from the seafood, not too long of a wait, and they made sure Sabz and I were comfy and hydrated while we waited for our noms.   Sushigiving!  Hi-five, Red Ember!"}
{"text":"So-so freshness on the fish.  Ordered the Spicy Hamachi with avocado and jalapeño, but the sauce that came on it was not good... Seemed too overbearing for the fish and avocado.  Sashimi seemed like it had been around for a while... Tasted pretty bland and had a tacky feel, like a preservative wash had been used.  Service was good and place was relatively quiet... Service and ambiance getting higher marks than the food."}
{"text":"They have good appetizers, and they were kind enough to give us a free appetizer that was just added to the menu. It was a little over priced to be honest but the sushi tasted good! We ordered a specialty sushi roll thinking it was raw salmon but to our disappointment it was cooked. It would be nice if the menu stated that. I give this place a 7/10 overall"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch after reading good reviews. I was very impressed. The server was attentive and friendly. The sushi chef also must take great pride in his work as the presentation was beautiful and the food was fresh and delicious. The food was reasonably priced as well.  Be prepared to have to look carefully for a parking space as it's a busy area.  I would say this is our new go-to sushi restaurant in Calgary!"}
{"text":"The fish wasn't very fresh, I couldn't even finish both rolls and only ate one of the ahi tuna nigiri simply because it didn't taste good, and I normally love sushi! Also the avocado wasn't even fresh! Wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"This place is the Calgary wow factor for me up to now! The food was so fresh! Parking was only 2$/h. Great atmosphere, Thomas did an amazing customer service, .. I will totally come back and bring everyone i know! They even gave me a free chef appetizer .. ! They say heaven has no taste ... Well yea this sushi little place was heaven to me for an Hour. Another thing : this place is clean freak .. ! Very well designed and furnished in style."}
{"text":"Red Ember has became one of my favourite spots for sushi. The chirashi is excellent and a bargain at $16.99. The tempura is lovely - the batter is light and crispy. The shrimp used for the tempura is sweet and large.   For the month of July, Red Ember is having a Stampede special. If you pay in cash, you get 10% off your entire bill! Yahoo! Now that's just incentive to visit Red Ember more often."}
{"text":"Get your seductive reading voice out - It's time for:  50 Shades of Sushi  It's been over a year since Red Ember and I had our first encounter. It was love where you least expect it. It was fresh, and it was raw. (See what I did there?).  Red is the kind of place I foolishly drove past without consideration. Too consumed in my own world to notice, never even considering \"what could be.\" That is, until one of my more, shall we say \"experienced\" friends suggested we meet up.  \"Really? You think we would hit it off?\" I asked her. \"Isn't Red a little, you know... 'dirty?\"  \"I know Red's not much to look at, but once you've been inside her/him, Red's the only one who can satisfy you...\"   It was true - Red wasn't much to look at. She/He didn't hang out with the other 'trendy' sushi joints down town, instead choosing to make her/his home on a lonely spot along 14th Ave. Red stands alone in a crowd of cars. Speeding toward their 9-5s, I'm not the only one who passed Red without noticing. If anyone took things a little slower, going by foot, they would see her/his beauty. Sadly, foot traffic is difficult to come by in Red's part of town.  Even if Red is open to having you, she/he can be very unapproachable. Red's Ember is by no means easy to experience. If you want to get inside Red, you need to go south, if you know what I mean... (Seriously, there's a divider. Head south on 14th Street. Red Ember is on the right.)   When you're close, just take a breath and slow down. Red's parking lot comes fast and is very tight. So tight you might not even fit. If that happens, just go a little further... You're very close. With the right moves (seriously, turn right) you might find the space to fit in Red's rear..  I sat down, nervous and excited. Encouraged by my friend who had been with Red Ember before and wanted to be with me for my first time. She guided me slowly and methodically through Red's menu. I slid my fingertip lightly along the text as Red's menu teased me with what I would soon put my lips around. - tempura...nigiri...sashimi.. Red knew what I liked. I slowly scanned his/her numbers and I checked Red's boxes in all the right places. I knew if I put my time in with Red at the beginning, Red would return the favour.  I'm lucky, you know... I'm a sushi cowboy who can't slow down. I loved Red, but that didn't stop me from leaving. Once I had Red I craved more and more. Some Unagi here, some Ebi there... I've been around. I've even gone \"all-you-can-eat\" just to taste some toro.   Red doesn't mind. Red's with many people every single night and always welcomes me back when I want it good."}
{"text":"After Sushi Man near the Calgary Tower closed a few years back, I've been on a city-wide quest to replace my favorite sushi, and Red Ember is it. The space is beautifuly-decorated with deep reds and clean lines. The service is excellent, and the food is always fresh and delicous. Their selection of sushi--both on the menu and on a piece-by-piece basis--is the best sushi I've discovered in a long while. The restraunt itself, and every piece of fish I've eaten there, both raw and cooked, is never \"fishy\". Located just down 14th street from famous Globe Fish, Red Ember is by far my first choice.  The menu is diverse, ranging from more traditional sushi and sashimi, to more fusion dishes and house specials. I've sampled several, for lunch and dinner, and they continue to amaze me. The presentation alone is impecable, and dishes are very reasonably priced for sushi in Calgary. There's even a delightful Beff Bulgogi for those who are looking for a little less fish and a little more Korean. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just plain good- no complaints whatsoever. Wish they did brown rice rolls though!  I would say it is one of the better Sushi restaurants I have visited in Calgary but to date I have only had about 4 different rolls on the menu.  A free dynamite or california roll is available for take out over $20 once you ask for the special.  Only thing to note: The parking height is deceiving as there are lowered ceilings on the 1st level so although I cleared the entrance, I hit the roof during parking so for vehicles over 6'2\" be careful!"}
{"text":"First of all, the restaurant is located on the ground floor of an office building.  This was previously a Japanese restaurant as well.  The on-site parking lot is paid parking operated by Impark, so you have to pay even if it is at night.  This is a distinct disadvantage when compared to other restaurants in the area, as evident by only a few customers on a weeknight.      As for the food, the tempera was very well done and the salmon was very fresh.  However, other than that, it is nothing special in a market that is saturated with sushi restaurants.  I had higher expectations with the reviews I have read.  The sashimi for example is normally accompanied by daikon garnish that is edible in other restaurants is absent here... definitely unusual. The sushi rice was nothing special... good nigiri sushi is defined by the rice. Service is good and we were looked after well.  All in all this is a decent choice for sushi but there are better ones out there in the market.  Solid 3.5 Stars out of 5."}
{"text":"I don't know if I visited on an off day or what - but long story short, everything was just ok and definitely not worth going back for at the price we paid. The highlight of our visit was the service as the servers were really great. I think this place is way too hyped, for whatever reason.   They have a sign in front of the place that says parking but it was closed off - due to construction? Not sure. Not a great place to visit during rush hour as 14 street gets really busy and it's difficult to find parking in the area.   The presentation of the food was great but I found it a little bit odd that they served the sashimi on ice - if you left it too long, it would freeze and was literally like eating frozen fish. I wonder if they do this to make it seem more \"fresh\".   We ordered the salmon and tuna sashimi, and a handful of rolls. They were kind enough to bring us a small plate of deep fried salmon to try. The salmon sashimi was ok but the tuna sashimi tasted really fishy - not the good kind of fishy! Our special scallop was also just ok, and had way too much mayo/sauce on it.   Everything was edible and I didn't bother sending anything back but I really did not understand why everyone raves about this place. Maybe I just visited on an off day? Not sure, but I won't be going back any time soon. I would rather pay $$$$ for Roku or go to Sakana during happy hour if I wanna be cheap."}
{"text":"This is a cozy little spot off of 14th ave. I had salmon roll, tuna roll, and real crab California. It was all delicious and it was nice to see the real crab California option!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi joint, and if I lived here, this would definitely be a regular. The sashimi is generously sized, the rolls are tasty, and the tempura batter is appropriately seasoned. We tried the Flames roll and the red dragon, and both were delicious. Service was efficient as well."}
{"text":"I enjoyed every bite of my sushi here, prices are very decent and the service is very good."}
{"text":"If you are looking for very authentic Japanese cuisine, skip this place.   First, although their ads say that they have parking in the back, it is paid parking by hour. The restaurant will not validate it or anything. The parking clearance is super low. Low like I can touch it easily with my 5'4 height.   Second, the sashimi and sushi are pretty good in freshness and size. However, the usual radish or daikon is non-existent. Instead, the fishes are arranged on a bowl of ice.   Third, the sushi pieces are not displayed like the more authentic method--small individual dishes. Instead, everything ordered will come out at the same time on a chopping board. It looks fancy, food tastes good, but the \"feel\" is off.   Fourth, the ikakaarage (fried big squid) feels absolutely westernized.   Fifth, the tempura sauce is just plain soy sauce without any of the daikon mash type of things. Personally, I dislike the taste.   Sixth, the udon soup is soy sauce broth....tasty but nothing special.   Overall, for the price we paid for this dinner, we can get better experience elsewhere. Probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"Sushi Club used to be my favourite place in the city but when it shut down, I was left without a place to call the best. After a friend told me about Red Ember, I've been a few times and without a doubt, it's become my new favourite. The food is delicious, it's never super busy and the staff is friendly. The only issue is parking (you have to park in behind, using the alley) but other than that, it's super delicious :)"}
{"text":"On the evening I picked for date night, I'm glad I made reservations. We had a lovely table by the window, and everything we ordered was delicious and beautifully presented. Hint: this isn't just the plum wine talking, because I'm writing my review well after its effect has worn off and just the memory remains. My wife and I wanted to experience a quieter, cozier Japanese dining ambiance, and they made it happen."}
{"text":"Amazing experience at Red Ember. Walked in at 830pm on a Friday night with a friend. We were greeted immediately and seated shortly even without reservations. The ambience and decor is warm and with hints of red in line with its name. The facilities looked clean and tidy. We ordered 3 regular rolls (dynamite, Philadelphia, and crispy California roll) and 1 signature roll (tiger eye).  All came out in a serving platter with beautiful presentation, and were absolutely delicious and fresh tasting! We also ordered a green salad and edamame beans to share. Green salad had a wicked dressing that made the standard greens a delight to have. Throughout the night the server made sure our water cups were always filled, which was a very noticeable and appreciated part of the service. The servers were pleasant and prompt in our requests. I really enjoyed my experience and meal here and will be certain to come back! I'll try take out next time - saw quite a number of guests come by the course of my meal to order or pick up take out, so seems like a popular option!"}
{"text":"Finally, my first true sushi meal that I've been content with, since my time in Calgary recently.  Ordered the red dragon roll: avocado, japeleno, imitation crab meat and spicy mayo.  It's a winner!  very fresh, avocado sliced generously.  Yam tempura roll, with more avocado: quite thick so great if you're hungry, a bit less taste but healthier nonetheless.  both rolls come w/ 8 pieces each, no wonder I'm still stuffed, that was over 2 hours ago lol.  Really modern, chic decor, lots of red (hence the name).  Kinda in the middle of nowhere, where it's on a main road without any retail stores/businesses around it, though behind their block, there's some residential and then some busy main roads leading to somewhere...  Called in for pickup, real nice service and friendly."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying, I've had a LOT of sushi in my day, and this is the first 5-star review I've given to a sushi place in Alberta.   My visit to Red Ember was decided on a whim - I was catching up with a good friend and I felt like I wanted some sushi. Despite growing up in the area, I had no idea Red Ember existed until I went to look for a good sushi place - I guess it must be fairly new.   Starting with the food - with Sushi in general, I'm not a fan of how many sushi restaurants try to be fancy with a million different fillings and sauces - I'm a firm believer that the quality of a sushi restaurant can easily be revealed in how well they do their basic rolls. For a dinner for two, I ordered 10-piece sashimi, spicy tuna roll, chop chop (scallop) roll, and negitoro (tuna, green onion) rolls, as well as uni sushi (which was the fresh weekly special). The sashimi was very fresh and cut very generously, which for the very reasonable price made the sashimi excellent in both value and quality. The spicy tuna was well done (but it's spicy tuna, for my less adventurous friend). The negitoro was delicious and is some of the best I've had in Alberta. The stand-out, however, was definitely the chop chop scallop roll. This is one of what I consider the staple rolls and the scallops tasted fresh and tender with generous portions and  the ratio of mayonnaise to scallop mix was spot on.   The Uni Sushi was decent as well, especially considering the price was fair ($8 for two).   I understand that they also offer a small Omakase Tasting menu ($35), which requires a day-advance notice for booking (which means I'll have to come back....).   The ambiance in the restaurant was actually pretty good despite the smaller location, and the service and wait staff were great. There is paid parking available in the parkade adjacent, but with only 6' clearance, a larger SUV or a truck will not fit.   And can I say, the price was incredibly reasonable for the amount and quality of food there. I was shocked to see that a dinner for two that we didn't even finish only ran me about $60 after tip and everything. That, combined with the quality of food, will mean I will definitely come again.   Oh man, those chop chop scallop rolls... to die for."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick lunch with the bf the other day. I enjoyed the experience quite a bit.  I was very tempted to get the chirashi don here, but the value of the lunch combos caught my eye first. We got two of their lunch combos; Sushi and Teriyaki Chicken with Dynamite Roll Lunch Combo & Sashimi and Tempura Lunch Combo.  Both the combos came with soup and salad. I was surprised by their salad dressing, it was very thick and creamy, I felt that it was a bit heavy for the salad that they provided. Their sushi and sashimi was top notch, they tasted fresh, and the cuts were a great size. The rice provided with the meals were a bit on the hard side, but still tasted good mixed with the miso soup and the teriyaki chicken sauce. It's very rare for me to eat tempura shrimp. The coating on the tempura was not too thick, and I loved the shrimp itself, it was sweet and the texture wasn't rough at all.  I'm excited to go back to try more items from them. It's just a stones throw away from work, so I might try their take out as well J they seem to have great reviews for that too."}
{"text":"Large and high quality servings of sushi and consistently well done tempura (never soggy in several visits) make this place a winner in my books. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this place!  Friendly servers who had some great recommendations.  Sashimi was fresh and thickly sliced!  We also had a couple rolls, tempura udon, tempura salmon, and a yakiudon!  All were great!  Only complaint would be the parking, as there is road construction right now."}
{"text":"My new favourite sushi place in Calgary. I've been here three times and have had nothing that hasn't impressed me. First and foremost: Rice is perfect. With that rice the chef makes inestimable nigiri (PLEASE try the \"unagi surprise,\" you won't be disappointed, and the cajun prawn is incredible with big luscious lumps of prawn that could pass for lobster) and delicious, creative rolls too, especially in my experience what they call the \"flames roll.\" Service is very sweet. LOVE this place."}
{"text":"This is Kensington/West Hillhurst's best kept secret! The sushi and sashimi are always fresh, and they have the best tempura...airy and crispy!! I eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Very generous pieces of sashimi and high quality.  Great lobster roll too.  Nice presentation and good service."}
{"text":"Why has it taken me so long to discover this amazing spot!? Some of the freshest sashimi I've had was here at Red Ember. The Bluefin Tuna is a memory I'll be salivating and savouring for some time. Generous chunks of hamachi perfectly cut. The presentation all around is something to come for, you will be very impressed. The service is top notch as well. Each server came to our table and was extremely attentive, upbeat and helpful. Will be back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"CHIRASHI DON is highly recommended! The waitress was very friendly & attentive to our needs. The chef is flexible & made adjustment to my chirashi needs. An appetizer was also served on-the-house. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Somehow I missed this place but am so FREAKING happy to have found a Vancouver quality sushi spot. This gets a five out of five for Calgary sushi because it laps any other sushi place in this city. The avacado yam tempura roll was delicious and the Mexican roll was a spicy delight. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We took our cousins here for there farewell dinner. My husband had been here numerous time with friends and he's always raving about it. However, it was the first time for me and I found their food delicious, service prompt and the ambiance perfect for dining out with friends and family. I would recommend this restaurant to try for sure. I'll for sure will be back. We had their miso soup, prawn tempura, Cajun roll, spicy tuna roll, flames roll and one more from their signature menu, I can't remember the name. Everything was awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great rolls, excellent sashimi portions and fresh, tasty food overall. I have long been a globefish fan but have continued to try new places in hopes of discovering something comparable. This is the first sushi place in Calgary where I wasn't regretting trying something new. Loved the Kamikaze roll, Mexican roll, cajun prawn sushi, salmon and toro sashimi, flames roll and the smoked salmon wrap app! Worth a try if u like real sushi. Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place to me and so we met for an early dinner (5:30pm).  I had a bit of a time looking for parking as there is no street parking along 14th street and most of the parking on the west side of 14th street is reserved for residences.  They do have pay parking right above them but I decided to park on the east side of 14th street in the large empty lot.  It's reserved for the condo but I doubt they'd care as it's usually empty.  Inside the ambiance is pretty contemporary.  No design elements stand out but I remember there being ample room for a small/mid-sized Japanese restaurant.  The music they were playing had a nice contemporary jazz feel.  The staff were friendly and prompt, asking us if we needed anything at the best times and letting us have long chats when needed.  One could dine off the appetizer menu alone with the vast selection.  We had the agedashi tofu, seafood poke and sunomono to start.  The tofu was cooked well, soft, but it didn't break apart in your chopsticks.  The poke had ample amounts of salmon sashimi and big chunks of avocado.  The flavours blended well and had a nice texture.  The poke was served on a crisp tortilla shell which could also be consumed should you so wish; best not let all that flavour go to waste!  The sunomono was the last of the appetizers to come out.  I've never had it before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  Apparently, nunomono is a Japanese dish consisting of cooked shrimp, noodles and thinly sliced cucumbers marinated in rice vinegar for several hours.  The taste was sweet and tangy.  The thicker glass noodles had a nice texture and shape to deliver the flavour of the marinade.  It was quite refreshing and I'm sure I'll have it again here!  We tried their grasshopper roll consisting of salmon tempura, mango, mayo, avocado, wakame and bonito flakes were sprinkled on top.  The roll had some good flavours going on.  I found the salmon tempura to be a bit dry and texture out of place; it still tasted good although I don't think I'll order it again.  Their appetizer tempura that we ordered was a good size and helped fill us up further.  They forget our order of miso soup but they did come back at the end of the meal to offer it for us.  We declined as we were quite full.   The meal was really well prepared and was not overly expensive.  With the food and a small bottle of sake the bill was in the mid-$40 range (before tax and tip).  I was quite happy with my first experience at Red Ember and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait. We ordered a bunch of rolls which took a while to prepare, but they were of top notch quality in taste, freshness and construction. Everything is perfectly crafted with the balance of flavors in every bite. The rolls are well crafted and do not fall apart easily while being transported from the dish to your mouth. Enjoyed all the selections that we picked."}
{"text":"Small, friendly atmosphere.  All our our dishes were very fresh and beautifully prepared.  Two of us had the Sushi and Sashimi combo platter.  In retrospect we could have split this dish considering we ordered appetizers.    Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
