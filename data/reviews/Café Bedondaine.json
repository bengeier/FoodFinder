{"text":"You know - I really like places that serve their purpose - you know? nothing fancy, nothing out if this world and nothing over priced. I ordered bacon with eggs and that's exactly what I got, cooked how I asked and served with a friendly smile. The reason that I'm not giving the place 5 stars is simply because it didn't wow me. It wasn't bad though and I wouldn't let my 3 stars stop you from coming."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast special there. Food is inexpensive but nothing glorious, good neighborhood cafe but nothing special. The decor however is very cool and the staff is very helpful and friendly. I wish they had a better selection of tea. Also they have those small sugar/milk/butter packets instead of having actual sugar and milk (and butter) in refillable jars which is more Eco-friendly (and it also looks better).  Their coffee is not fair-trade. I may be pushing it a bit far but I just wished there was more to this place as it is one of the first cute café to open on my end of St-Catherine east. In any case, if you are just up for a regular diner food experience in a cute vintage café atmosphere, La Bedondaine is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Les brunch sont bons, belle ambiance ! À découvrir dans Hochelaga ! Le personnel est également sympathique !"}
{"text":"J'y suis allée pour déjeuner, j'ai pris des crêpes au fromage qui étaient bonnes mais j'aurais aimé des fruits dans mon assiette. Par contre, l'endroit est très charmant, la décoration comme je l'aime! Un bel endroit dans Hochelaga. On peut même jouer à des jeux, ils ont une bibliothèque avec quelques uns qui sont à la disposition des clients."}
{"text":"The food was cold, which is incredible because we were the only one in the restaurant. Pretty basic food selection with no frill. Prices were okay. It took forever for our plate to arrive. The interior is run down a bit."}
{"text":"Go here if you want to eat a tasty Quebecois breakfast/brunch/lunch for a really good price.  I recommend their French onion soup & their house-made marmalade (they also have house-made cretons).   The interior is very appealing, fresh and modern, and the service is super attentive.   They're looking into getting jazz-nights and \"bring your own wine\" permits, I hope they get them.  In short: Great place."}
