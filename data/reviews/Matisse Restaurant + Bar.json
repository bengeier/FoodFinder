{"text":"Came here for lunch and dinner today.  It was way to cold out to venture anywhere else outside the Marriott where I was staying.  The  place is decorated nicely,  and not overly lavish.     I ordered the grilled lamb,  and it was amazing.   It's on the petite side,  but has a great blackened flavor.   I asked for the spring vegetables mix to be steamed with no oil or butter.   They were delicious.   Great combo for a light lunch.   The service at lunch was a little slow,  and we ran late to a meeting as a result.   I had similar issues with the wait in the evening when I sat at the bar by myself.   The bartender acts as a server and bartender,  and he was rarely at the bar.   Not his fault though.  This is something untypical of a restaurant at a Marriott.     The cold from the Marriott revolving doors blasts into the dining area.   The place was extremely cold,  like meat locker cold.   I was cold with a ski jacket on,  and my toes were numb by the end of dinner.   They should really invest in some air curtains to prevent the cold air from blasting in.     For dinner I went light and got the appetizer scallops on the garden salad.   Salad was good,  and scallops were cooked great.     In short,  come here when it's warmer,  expect a wait,  but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I would normally turn my nose up at the hotel restaurant, but was super pleased with everything about Matisse. As a vegetarian, I found the options offered to be super accommodating.   The waitstaff was incredibly helpful - so much so that they even told me how to get to Union Station from the hotel, nearly step-by-step instructions.   Highlights: the apple and beet special soup (AMAZING), the trio of legumes (I'm on a train honestly DREAMING about it), and the Matisse salad (sans bacon).   I had the poached eggs this morning, and they were just fine, but the real hit were the potatoes. I almost never indulge, but they were SO good, and a small portion that made them feel not as unhealthy as they most certainly were."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious and will never return. The food made me incredibly sick so be warned!  Service: Slow and inattentive. The staff would look at us and promptly ignore.I literally had to cup my hands around my mouth to force him to look my way. I believe the waiter came by only once to refill our water leading us to be parched by the end of our meals. The cutlery was dirty and there were fruit flies hovering over my meal.   Ambiance: Literally no one but myself and my friend. The music was blaring so it was difficult to talk or communicate orders.   Food: As I said above, I got sick that night. Here is what I ate:  Salad: Most of the leaves were wilted and the hard boiled egg tasted of absolutely nothing. The vinaigrette was sub par tasting only of cream.   Salmon: The fish itself was bland as bland can be and the green beans and potatoes underneath it were not cooked all the way through. Also they were glazed with something I later realized to be margarine. Disgusting.  Dessert: A creme brulee that was falling apart without a hard crust on top with a grocery store bought shortbread cookie.  Overall, avoid. There are so many good restaurants around there don't fall for this trap!"}
{"text":"Hello,  I wanted to share our wonderful experiences we had at your restaurant. My husband and I are visiting family and we stayed 4 nights.  We are usually on the concierge's level and eat breakfast there, but with the weekend closure we got to enjoy your restaurant.   Our waiter was Rashid on 4/1/17 and he was truly amazing. He made a simple breakfast experience spectacular. Not just for us, but I noticed his professionalism and  graciousness extended to all his customers. I  have managed people my whole career and I just know that this gentleman exemplified what Marriott hopes for in their employees.   Our breakfast was executed perfectly and started our day off right.  Thank you to Rashid for all that you do-it was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Pretty average hotel restaurant fare. My angus beef burger was pretty much the epitome of middle-of-the-road Toronto burger. Very large serving though with some tasty fries, although they were a little too salty for my taste. Very friendly wait staff and the place was deserted at 6:30 on a Monday so also very prompt."}
{"text":"Yummy! For a hotel restaurant (Marriott), it pretty good. Try the grilled cheese sandwich or the buttered chicken. I frequently stay at the hotel and never tire of their food."}
{"text":"Service was awful. We were only one of three tables filled and our server was trying to rush us out at the end of our dinner. It was 9pm! He also had to be pushed to answer a question requiring him to ask the chef about the ingredients in one of the dishes. The food was just so-so for $35 price fix. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Overall unimpressive. Chicken was dry and the dish wasn't very flavourful. Brownie was overpriced given how small the portion was."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious 2014- was ok but not great.  The restaurant is inside the Marriott hotel. We got seated right away as there weren't many people in there. The staff was friendly and pretty attentive other than they didn't ever fill up my water. The servers did however bring you new cutlery every time you were about to have a new meal. My friend and I ordered the same thing so here it is:  Appetizer: smoked Salmon- it wasn't bad but again it wasn't great, you get 3 small round of bread with a thin beat and some smoked salmon on top. The presentation was very nice.  Main: Steak and Fries, pretty much taste and looks just like it sounds. I asked for medium rare and ended up getting medium well! The restaurant was getting pretty busy and I was on a short lunch break so I really didn't have time to set it back. The fries were tasty but the steak was a little bland   Dessert: Vanilla cr√®me brulee- this was quite tasty and refreshing after the meal but again it wasn't that great. The top didn't have that crunchy shell you have to break through. It was there but it was unimpressive.   All in all is was all just OK, for the $20.00 is wasn't bad but if it wasn't for winterlicious I would not go back again and pay full price."}
{"text":"I joined some guests for breakfast here. The food was \"ok\" but the service was horrible.  Given that they had an offer which provided them free \"buffet\" breakfast, I guess its cool...but I would never pay for this.  - seat yourself? Where are the clean tables? - 0 cutlery - nobody to take your order for coffee ect.  For a Marriott hotel on Bloor..this is a big fail."}
{"text":"I came here for a date night for the winterlicious deal and I enjoyed my experience.  The atmosphere was nice and romantic, it's connected to the Marriott hotel.  I had shrimps in a cherry tomato sauce for appetizers, steak frites for the main course, and a creme caramel for dessert. The portions were pretty big, especially for the main course.  There were only 1 or 2 waitresses on the floor and the waitress that was serving me wasn't that great. She didn't seem like she wanted to be there.  Overall, the food was alright, but was too pricey for my liking. Would not go here if it wasn't for winterlicious."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast meeting here...look ma, I'm all growns up now!  Matisse is located inside the Marriott Hotel on Bloor St and therefore, the clientele is predominantly business folk grabbing some food before they start their day.  I'm not one to ever eat in a hotel restaurant unless I absolutely have no other choice.  Service is friendly and quick to come over with water/fresh OJ offerings.  I ordered the Eggs Benny with smoked salmon ($18) and the OJ ($5).  The eggs came with a side of hash browns and grilled tomato.  The portion is very generous but it was just okay...not the best I ever I had but passable and made for a very filling weekday breakfast.  I won't be getting breakfast at Matisse on a regular basis due to its pricey entrees but it's nice to know that there is a more formal breakfast option in this area."}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant close to work hold our year end manager's dinner party. This restaurant was the ideal location as its located right out of Yonge station on the subway line and one of the only restaurants in the location with a parking lot complete with valet service plus it's in the Marriott Hotel so what's not to love!  I emailed the restaurant in advance telling them that I was looking for a 3 course set menu + glass of wine & tea/coffee with dessert. The food and beverage manager Rohan did an exceptional job by creating a beautiful menu with 3 selections to chose from for the appetizers and desserts and 4 different mains. Plus option of red or white wine by pellar estates and a selection of Tazo teas or Starbucks coffee (decaf or regular) with dessert.  The service the waiters provided surpassed my expectations! For our group of 22 we had two waiters specifically catering to us. They were very professional and polite from start to finish. As each guest arrived the waiters were quick to take our coats and show us to the table. The long dark wood table was already set waiting for us with the special menu beautifully printed outlining our options for the different courses.  The meal began with the waiters going round offering red or white wine followed by the presentation of 4 baskets packed with ample amounts of fresh sliced white and dark rye breads + butter. Then the waiters went around taking everyone's order. Wait time for food was not long and they were prompt to clear dishes as each person finished.  My order was:  Market Green - Green leaf, radicchio, baby spinach and romaine hearts, pickled carrot and red beet tangle with maple sesame dressing Very fresh tasting and beautifully presented, I loved the dressing!  Char-Broiled 8oz New Steak - With sour cream and chive whipped potato and peppercorn cognac au lait My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, I enjoyed the kick the peppercorn sauce provided and the potatoes were just melt in your mouth  Chocolate Truffle with sweet mango coulis It was like a thick creamy milk chocolate mousse cake. I loved the contrast with the mango.  At the end of the meal everyone was happily stuffed! Every single person loved there meal and were impressed by the immaculate service the waiters provided. I highly recommened this restaurant especially for large groups! You'll surely impress! From food to service everything was top notch!  FYI This restaurant is located inside the Marriott Hotel on the left as soon as you walk into the lobby. There is a sign outside the hotel that reads Matisse but that will take you to the subway not restaurant. Washrooms are located diganolly to the right across the lobby."}
