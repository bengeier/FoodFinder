{"text":"Chicken was hot and seasoned well I got six wings with a side of fries.  I wouldn't advise you to get extra seasoning, because the seasoning is a little spicy.  The price is reasonable, they do offer other selections like, fried perch, catfish, chicken livers, fried okra, and a few other sides as well.  I do not advise you to reheat the chicken or fries, it does not taste the same."}
{"text":"It's great to see that there's now a Hook and Fish on the west side of the city. Portions are huge!  

I got the $7 catfish nugget value meal. There's definitely a lot of food but I felt like there was more breeding then fish. Fries were good. I also tried the wings. I thought they were good. But if you don't like your wings fried hard you might not like them. The seasoning they put on after is what makes everything good!"}
{"text":"Fuck hook fish and chicken on Broadway whoever is working the counter is trash and has a horrible attitude I called back because I got not tater sauce with my fish...didn't know you had to ask for it and she got a whole attitude with me they whole time she took my order she barely said a word never asked if i wanted sauces or what drink i wanted for my value meal i had to ask her about the drink and i asked if they had honey mustard for my husbands chicken tenders they didnt so i asked for bbq but she never asked if i wanted any other sauces. I asked to speak to a manager and he refused to even get on the phone and speak to me. Their food might be good but I will not give a business my money with attitudes like that....its just bad business!!! And after writing a post about it on facebook ive had several people tell me theyre having the same experiance."}
