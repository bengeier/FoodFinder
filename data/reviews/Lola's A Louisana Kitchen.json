Worst service and worst Canjun food. Gumbo was horrible and the other food was not canjun at all."}
{"text":"The bread pudding was great. The red beans and rice was good, not extraordinary. The greens tasted like they were from a can though. The jambalaya was very good. Restaurant is very small, location not ideal. All in all I would say so-so experience."}
{"text":"2nd time for crawfish, AWSUM! They are getting bigger and tastier. The perfect spice level, the lips get numb and the tung burns till you reach the  perfect apex! More important the service is exceptional every time. What's more important is being a repeat customer they remember us! Absolutely love the place!"}

{"text":"Best food outside ya mama's kitchen! Gumbo! Yeah! Shrimp creole? Uh huh! Shrimp and grits? Out a' site! Remoulade? Yep! Dont forget to order the bread pudding and banana's foster.  Coming back for the soft shell crab po' boy on leidenheimer bread"}
{"text":"Great service!! Expectedly good eats, and THE BANANAS FOSTER is perfect. Not the bananas foster bread pudding, which we didn't have, but wow...just wow!"}
{"text":"Seated immediately at table for two.  Sweet tea was perfect; just the right amount of sweet. About five minutes after we were seated, we were kindly asked to move to another table to accommodate another party of three.  We agreed, but found it a little peculiar, as there was another table empty next to us.  

Server, Bethany was attentive and very friendly.  I ordered my usual, Shrimp Charlotte and my spouse had the Shrimp Creole.  Both were seasoned well with just the right amount of heat.  Crawpuppies didn't disappoint either. Dessert was sweet potato pecan pie that was served piping hot.  Husband forgot to mention he liked it room temperature, but couldn't stop eating it either way.  

Overall, great dinner as we've come to expect."}
{"text":"So delicious if it weren't for the salt! Holy crap you can make it tasty without over killing it with salt! Disappointed because at first it is so good then the salt started cutting the inside of my mouth :(."}
{"text":"Good food, pleasant atmosphere. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We went their for lunch today (6/25/12) about 11:35am. The place is small and it packed. The waitress was quick to ask us what we wanted to drink, but after that it took her a long time to come back and take our food order. I ordered the Gumbo, my husband ordered the Catfish and Grits, and our daughter ordered the BBQ Shrimp. When the food finally came out, my Gumbo was warm at best. It took our waitress a few minutes to bring the bread (which is very tasty, by the way) The BBQ Shrimp was salty, but the shrimp was cooked correctly, and the Catfish and Grits were good.  Then we had dessert. We shared a Bread Pudding and Bananas Foster dish.  The bread pudding was really just a banana bread (or so it seemed to be, but it wasn't bread pudding) with caramelized sugar spooned on top, then topped with a small scoop of ice cream. No bananas in site. All in all, the food was OK in taste, portion sizes are small for the price, and the service was SLOW!  We may try Lola's again to try their Po-boy sandwich, but other than that, I do not see us returning.  Too bad, we love Cajun food."}
{"text":"My rating is not based on their food but on my visit to their establishment a couple of weeks ago. My 3 friends and I, ironically, found Lola's on Yelp. We read the great reviews and decided to have dinner there. We noticed it was stated \"reservations preferred\". Keyword, \"preferred\", not \"required\". Walking up to the entry, we observed at least 3 empty tables on the patio and a couple inside and knew we would be able to have dinner. We walked in just after 6:00pm and were greeted by a gentleman/host at the entry and told him 4 for dinner. He looked at his seating computer and said, \"We're unable to seat you. We have reservations for 7:00pm that will fill all our seating. Let me look again...no, we can't do it. Maybe you guys can fit in at the bar. No, that's full now\".

WOW!!! The 4 of us were flabbergasted! We couldn't believe with an hour before the \"supposed\" reservations, that we couldn't be seated and served. And who's to say that every reservations would have been on time or there could have been a cancellation. Well, we'll never know...about any of the above or the food.
Great job on customer service Lola"}
{"text":"Call me simple, but I sure do love a po' boy sandwich.

My parents and I decided to drop in for dinner before catching a show at the Smith Center. You'll notice their Louisiana spirit just by taking a glance around! Their dining area is cozy and a little tight so you should call in advance if you have a large group.

The fried catfish po' boy was my catch of the day. When it finally came to the table, I peeked into my sandwich and saw a meager catfish filet that resembled those of my poor college student days. The breading was bland, but the fish was moist. Other than that, they followed through on my request to be easy on the mayo and tartar sauce. Their bread is magical. I don't even know how, but it is.

The service was mediocre. Perhaps it was just a busy night and we were in a hurry, but our food seemed to take forever to get from the kitchen to our table. Not sure if the bread was complimentary or if it was to appease our growing appetites as we waited. On a positive note, our waitress was very accommodating and even put in a rush order for us, which I'm very thankful for.

All in all, there were some hits and misses, but their menu's enough for me to return someday and try their gumbo, sweet potato fries, and their banana fosters."}
{"text":"Came here expecting wonderful food.  ordered the Jambalaya and was so disappointed.  It was a pile of gummy rice with a few pieces of sausage and about two small chunks of chicken.  The dish was so salty I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"For the first time triple D disappointed me. Roasted beef po boys wasn't good. My beef too dry and no taste. The fig delight with bad pecan in it. Order grill shrimp bo boys but the shrimp was cooked instead of grill.
Service wasn't good. My coke was empty for half of the time we were there."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for a convention.  A business associate and I were looking for good Creole food. Lola delivers! GREAT crab cakes and the fried oysters are wonderful. Leave room for their bread pudding. The waiter staff is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Great food. My wife and.I enjoyed.it .
Only negative is the door opening brings a draft of cold air in the room. Kind of annoying when you are comfortable eating dinner"}
{"text":"Best authentic cajun/ creole food I have ever had
Learned about Lola's on DDD and had to check it out.
Not disappointed at all. A must visit."}
{"text":"Really good spice level.  Awesome shrimp plates.  Pretty mundane po'boys.  Overly charred bread.  Incredible bread pudding.

Cramped indoor seating but still good eats.  Don't go here if you're vegetarian."}
{"text":"Every now and then I come across a specialty restaurant known for some amazing ethnic food or just something completely odd that also happens to serve the perfect burger. I'm not here to present one today, as Lola's didn't provide me anything worthy. I've really enjoyed all of the dishes I have tried over the past couple years, but never even considered getting a burger there until someone suggested it months ago. And as the rule typically goes for me, if only one person in this city has suggested the burger there, it's probably for a reason.

Lola's is a really tight space in the Holsum Lofts building on Charleston at the 15 next to a now-abandoned antiques store. The restaurant has a bunch of two and four seat tables, 6 seats at the bar plus another little 2 seat high top, and a bunch of seating outside during the warm months. It can get very packed very quickly during lunch and dinner so either get there early or prepare for a bit of a wait if you choose to come during peak times, I think they may also take reservations. The parking lot sucks and also fills up quickly so keep that in mind if you're running late. Their menu features everything you can expect from a restaurant with the title \"A Louisiana Kitchen\"; crab cakes, catfish and grits, po'boys, bread pudding, etc. Everything I've had here has always been rich and tasty, so when someone suggested the burger I got a bit excited. How can a place that does nearly everything right screw up a burger?

Lola's burger is a never frozen, lean beef patty with lettuce, tomato, mayo and mustard. Knowing what typically gets served here, I was shocked to see a puny burger show up in front of me. The meat had ok flavor, but no char and totally overcooked beyond the medium rare I ordered. The bun was thin, small and way too generic. The tomatoes were not very red and fairly weak, the mayo and mustard were barely present. Overall there was nothing juicy about this as their online menu claims, and I really questioned whether I need to try a burger at every single place in town just in case they have that one secret amazing burger. I'm starting to think the answer is no. Everyone can put a burger on their menu to satisfy that one odd person in the group that doesn't want to eat the amazing Louisiana food that's served there, or the pizza that everyone else is getting, but if it's nothing great then what's the point? There are certainly exceptions to the rule, but I need to start limiting myself to restaurants that I know for sure provide something at least somewhat worthy of reviewing.

The fries on the other hand were actually pretty good. Not sure if they were entirely fresh but cooked really well; skin on with a decent amount of seasoning. There were lots of little crunchy bits, but I wish there was a bit more of the larger pieces as there weren't too many actual fries to chow down on with my burger. My meal came to $12.42 with an iced tea and an extra dollar for my not completely melted swiss cheese, basically far too much for a burger meal of this caliber. I don't think I need to reiterate that you shouldn't come here for the burger; there is plenty of great Louisiana style food here that you can't go wrong with, so just stick with that."}
{"text":"This is actually my second time here. The first time my phone died and I could not check in. The Shrimp & Grits, Garlic Bread and Gumbo is why I came back for a 2nd round. I love all things NOLA and this is as close as you get without heading south. This will always be on my stop list. Also love that it is off the strip so no hassle and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went to Lola's this weekend. This same group of friends traveled to NOLA a couple of years ago. When we heard about this place we had to give it a try. This place is very small (like it would be in NOLA) and the employees are very friendly. As soon as we walked up we were greeted by a very nice hostess. She didn't have a table for us, but offered us but was very attentive while we waited. I took advantage of the opportunity to enjoy an Abita Strawberry while we waited. Once we got our table we ordered the gumbo and the crab dip for appetizers. Both selections were good. I should have asked for some file for my gumbo, but it was good. The crab dip was delicious. Main course I had the jambalaya with shrimp and extra sausage on the waitress's suggestion. Full of that NOLA love I was looking for. We split the bread putting for good measure. It took a while to get a cab from here on a busy day, but no worries we just went ahead and ordered up some more Abitas chatted with the staff and let the good times roll. I'll definitely be visiting again. They have plans for a second location in the near future. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"No frills good Louisiana Southern cuisine.  I had the Red Beans & Rice (cooked low n slow) just mention hold the scallions LOL

Now for the meat of the review, I would've given it 4-5 stars had my back not been on fire due to the seating location.  Had curbside table with the ever so busy W. Charleston Blvd to the left of me so I'm sucking down exhaust while eating good food."}
{"text":"The yelpers came through again. I chose this place based on the mostly highly-starred yelping. It's a lovely and lively little place with very good food. We hit the tail end of a weekday lunch rush.  I tried the shrimp and grits...scrum! Really moreishly creamy grits and perfectly grilled shrimp with spicy oily sausagy sauce. Just the right size portions, too. Left room for desserts! Hubby had bread pudding and I had sweet potato & pecan pie with chantilly cream. Both divine, but mine took the cake!! 

Only (very minor) drawback is that I couldn't really take my parents there because they're on low-sodium diets. The food was on the brink of being overly salty (it's not outside the realms of possibility that I am more salt sensitive than the general populace), but the spice balance was otherwise excellent. We will defo go back and are looking forward to trying more of the delectable looking menu choices. It's not a giant menu, but we really had a hard time choosing because everything looked so appealing. 

Ace place...go see for yourself! :)

I'm updating this to 5 stars. I've been back many times since my first visit and can't find fault. A bigger second location would be fab. Hope their success continues! :)"}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits were delicious!!!!! Gumbo was good. The roast beef style sandwich was....ehhh. I'd give this place a 5 star if it were cheaper because the portions were so small. Don't let that big bowl fool you...its pretty shallow. Good customer service!"}
{"text":"Sure, there's plenty of great food on and near the Strip, but sometimes it's good to get away from the casinos and check out the rest of Sin City.  And Lola's is a good excuse to do so.

Had the catfish and grits for brunch.  The grits were cheesy perfection, flavorful and creamy.  The catfish was seasoned well, a nice balance of salty, spicy, and smoky.  The fish itself, however, betrayed LV's location in the middle of the desert.  It hadn't gone bad, but it clearly wasn't fresh from the river bottom. I guess I should have expected as much.

Friend had the etouffee.  Reported that it was tasty, but not the best of his life.

The service was prompt and friendly.  Decor was a curious mix of sports bar meets family dining.  Unassuming, you could call it.

Overall, a nice little restaurant for when you want a moment of calm to collect yourself before throwing more good money after bad."}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times but haven't had a chance to write a review until now.  The food here is very good, seafood is always very fresh.  I've had a po-boy and some of their other dishes.  The jambalaya is one of the better that I've had, and their gumbo is pretty good too.  The only reason I took away a star is for price.  It was $20 with tip for a bowl of gumbo and a drink.  A little pricey for lunch, especially considering I was hungry again after a few more hours."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I have been coming here, off and on, for a little over a year. The restaurant is pretty small, which is both good and bad; good, because it's cozy and intimate, bad, because it often takes 30min+ to be seated.  Lola's has taken some creative approaches to finding places to seat more people: in a vacant corridor next to the restaurant, outside in front of other businesses, etc. While I commend the ingenuity, unfortunately the service falters when sitting in these areas.  One last note, given the incredible business that Lola's receives, I expected a sturdier table and perhaps a candle atop for ambiance, it would've been an inexpensive investment in their business.
The po' boy that Guy Fieri ate on DDDs is, indeed, delicious, but at $11.49, I expected a bigger sandwich.  I've tried most of the menu at this point, and in addition to being unreasonably expensive, the flavour has also been lacking.  Not to mention most come with 5 shrimp, literally a cup of rice, and then whatever the accompanying sauce may be.
Here's the biggest secret of Lola's, and the most compelling reason to return: the bananas foster bread pudding! This is simply the most delicious dessert I've ever had! If you come to Lola's, if nothing else, try this dessert! 
If the hostess had been friendlier, and the food either more reasonably priced or portioned better, I would've given Lola's a 4 or 5 star review, but I feel that the restaurant is coasting on the DDDs visit and tourism, rather than perfecting their dishes, and their customer's experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the blackened salmon, green beans, and French fries. Though the portion size of the salmon was huge, the flavor was extremely bland. So bland to the point salt and pepper didn't help. The green beans were sad. I won't elaborate. The french fries were good. Ate them all. Ummm overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"What a little diamond in the rough! Absolutely fantastic authentic food, get it while you can!"}
{"text":"Lived here 7 years & never knew this place existed, and have driven by it almost daily for 3!!  Anyway, I felt at home & for me, any restaurant that reminds you of home is worth more than 5 stars!!  Growing up in the south & catching crawfish/crawdads for dinner are all but fond memories for me...not any more!!!  

Ok so anyway....I love catfish & am very picky where I will order it from. (NEVER at Lucille's FYI). I took a chance & ordered the catfish po'boy.... OMG beyond yummy. I ordered it blackened...it was perfect. Juicy, tender, right amount of spice...NO BONES.  Next time I'm getting the platter. Nothing's worse than overcooked fish...especially catfish. Lola's got it right!!!

Now...the place is small so I don't recommend large groups going here...your large group may in fact take up the entire the restaurant.  The parking situation can be a nightmare.  Lola's shares parking with several other businesses so if you must have lunch at Lola's...get there by 11:30 am.  There is no street parking nor are there other parking lots nearby you can use.  Outside seating is in front of the restaurant and is within the property lines, so it's quite small.  Regardless of size...it's a cool place.  Is it worth the wait?  Yep, just bring your own chair so you'll have a place to sit outside."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! If you like Cajun/Creole food, you must give it a try. Absolutely all of their meats are delicious blackened.

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Tons and tons of flavor in everything. Their bread pudding is also to die for!"}
{"text":"When I need a vacation to New Orleans... Lola's... Kick AYASS!! I've had EVERYTHING on the menu and it's all good!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Cajun/creole food I've had in LV!  Really a hidden gem and not dirty or greasy like many of the Creole places I've been.  You should call ahead tho if it's a weekend, they have limited seating.  That Grilled bread is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service!  The catfish was amazing and be sure to try the bread pudding for dessert!  Our server Frank was top notch, very attentive and his menu recommendations were spot on!  This restaurant is a true jewel of the Las Vegas cuisine scene.  Check it out today!"}
{"text":"DO NOT FREQUENT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!! While the food is admittedly pretty decent, they provide the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. Without question. As a first (and not only) example, a work lunch with two colleagues turned into a 2-hour affair, thus making us very late for a meeting, when the food took FOREVER to arrive at our table. As a second example, we called in at 5:45pm on a Friday night to confirm that no reservations were needed for an early dinner yet were told the exact opposite upon our arrival at the restaurant. As a third example, we have been greeted in a discourteous and seemingly malicious manner every time we have attempted to eat here. I could not say the reason why. Needless to say, we will never attempt to eat at this establishment again and I will be promptly informing every one of my colleagues to avoid this place as well. This absolutely awful service, bordering on outright hostility, is not worth abiding for a decent plate of food which can be just as easily ordered at another local establishment with much better service: Rhythm Kitchen on Decatur and 215. Please take my advice and avoid Lola's like the proverbial plague!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was brought here for my birthday and really enjoyed my meal. I ordered the fried chicken salad and lemonade. My date ordered fried soft shell crabs. We both really enjoyed our meals. Our server (Megan) was on point and attentive. For a small business,  it's pretty busy but the staff is super nice. Glad we came. Thanks Lola's!"}
{"text":"Decided to get away from the strip for dinner, and this was totally worth it. 

I had the shrimp and grits. Ah-mazing. Just the right amount of kick. My husband had the the beef po'boy. He couldn't even finish it, and he's a healthy eater. He said it had just the right level of seasoning ...went really well with his Newcastle. 

Service was terrific. Friendly and efficient - couldn't ask for anything more. 

We'll definitely be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"OMG this place is to die for! I researched a place to have dinner off the strip prior to our couple's getaway in Jan. 2010. EVERYTHING we ordered was FABULOUS! From the crab cakes to dessert. SO, SO good. Good service too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live in Colorado and saw this on Dinners, Drive Inns and Dives so decided to try it. She's from Louisiana and I lived in the south for 15 year so expectations where low, we were happy to find this was this best Cajun food either of has had anywhere outside New Orleans and will return every time we are in town. The last visit I had the boiled crawfish and man that was like being in the back yard of a real live Louisiana crawfish boil!!!!"}
{"text":"Before reading this review, know that I am huge cajun-style food fan and it has been a long time since I have been to New Orleans and had the best.

This place is really good. It was one of the first places I ate at after moving here and the first jambalaya dish was amazing. Add some great beer and amazing service and I was hooked!

The second time I went, it was unfortunately the exact opposite. The order was not put in correctly, came out wrong and the service was not good from the beginning. Their solution was to take the Po Boy I ordered and flip it over onto a new piece of bread to get rid of the mayo. Not cool.

The third time was at lunch instead of dinner and that was really good, the service was good and there was not wait or rush to move us out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"On a scale of never again to I've gotta have it, I give it an ehhh. A friend had suggested trying Lola's some time ago, but we went in another direction. After having visited my hometown in SC, I was craving some southern goodness and after searching on Urbanspoon, we picked Lola's. I didn't realize it had been featured on DD&D until I read the reviews on Yelp. 

Lola's is quaint. The restaurant has about 10-15 tables. It's best to get there before 6 if you want to minimize the wait time. When all my friends arrived we ordered. I ordered the jambalaya. It was really flavorful and tasty. The only problem is that the rice was so over cooked and mushy, it resembled something you would spread between bricks, not put on plate. Again it was very tasty, yet mushy or \"moggy\" in the words of my southern mother. 

A friend ordered the read beans and rice of which I had to sample. I've eaten rice with every kind of bean imaginable so I figured this would be good. I mean how can you go wrong with rice and beans. Well Lola's was utterly FLAVORLESS!!! No taste whatsoever. 

Could I come back? I guess, but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice. 

Side note: unless I missed it, beignets were missing from the menu. What Louisiana, creole/Cajun restaurant doesn't have beignets on the menu?"}
{"text":"I'm a shrimp and grits fiend so naturally it's my go to dish at any Southern style restaurant. Lola's did not disappoint. Amazing smoky flavor. Loved the blackening season on the perfectly cooked shrimp and the creamy gouda cheese grits with the just right salty mushroom ragu-was absolutely priceless.  For a few dollars more opt for the extra shrimp. Worth every smoky bite!"}
{"text":"G-O-U-D-A  GRITS! Where have you been all my life? 

Came to the Downtown location for lunch - go early or late because it is small and gets crowded. Ordered the CHICKEN plate, fried, with 2 sides- the grits and red beans & rice.  Uh - so full just thinking bout it but I wanted to try my favorite things. 

The fried CHICKEN was cooked great but the meat itself needed some seasoning. Waitress offered the house hot sauce which I adventurously accepted (I love hot sauce) but this was toooo spicy - even for me. And I didn't love the flavor of it. And it cost an extra .50cents (I'm not cheap it's just the principle, I wouldn't of cared at all if I really liked it ;).

So the RED beans & RICE were yummy! But the Gouda GRITS are \"da bizness\" and I can't wait to have them again! Note: both of these Sides have an \"upcharge\" which is noted on the menu for the grits but the not the RB&R. 

All was well - our fabulous server took it off without us even asking. She gave great service the whole meal!

We will be checking out the Summerlin location soon (before I go Caveman diet) and I'd love to take an order of grits home to make with some eggs!"}
{"text":"Nice small decor. High expectations based on the yelp reviews. The gumbo was spicy. As in too spicy to actually enjoy it. Grits were flavorful but very thick. Not very creamy in texture.
The catfish po boy was about the best thing going on at this place."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and Gouda grits, a cup of gumbo and then made my full self stuff down the delicious bread pudding. So yummy I keep craving it."}
{"text":"Some of the best Cajun food I have had! The restaurant is pretty small but wasn't very busy when my husband and I arrived around 4pm. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. Don't leave without trying their dessert! The bananas foster was amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great for Las Vegas! Highly recommend anything with the Gouda grits and I really enjoyed the red beans and rice. Bananas Foster Bread Pudding was amazing. 

Not a big restaurant so make reservations. Also, the food you get vs the price is on par with the rest of US unlike the strip or downtown and really almost anywhere else in Vegas. Got out of there under $50 with dessert and a beer. Will gladly go back!"}
{"text":"Perfect portion sizes, awesome fresh tasting sweet potato fries and the lightest most delicious grits since I was in NOLA! Yum:)

it looks like it connects to a exhibit/museum next door- more to explore when i return. because i will!"}
{"text":"i was extended to eat  here when i first walked in i notice that the restaurant was  small but  i really liked the atmosphere and the look of the restaurant  the food  was good and they had really good deserts and i also  liked the service  it's a good family owned business i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We found this place on DDD when coming into Vegas for a couple of days and it did not disappoint. We called to make a reservation but then forgot that there was a time change and we were going to be an hour early. The hostess, Madison, was so accommodating and sat us right when we got there. I recommend getting the crab cakes and the craw puppies for an appetizer because they were to die for. The crab cake was full of crab and had a fantastic lemon aoli on top of it. For the entre I would recommend getting the shrimp and grits which was spicy and fully of flavor. For dessert we got the bread pudding which wasn't too soft or too firm, and had a great brown sugar topping on it. If your are looking for a place decently priced off the strip I would go here. Lola was even there helping out with drinks  and came over to our table to male sure we enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"My friend and I are going to eat at the Triple D restaurants in Las Vegas our first one for 2013 was Lola's OMG I had the Gouda grits with shrimp It was amazing my friend had the roast beef po boy it was also excellent and we planned it around first Friday downtown that was also amazing We will both do both again"}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other day with my wife and mother in law. The service was quick and the food came out hot and tasty. We all enjoyed our meal and I was able to get back to work in an hour."}
{"text":"Thank goodness we found this restaurant (through Yelp!) and have been there two days in a row. Just a few minutes from the World Market Pavillions. The food was delicious: Po' Boys, Etouffee, Crab Cakes over greens, Catfish and Grits, Blackened Salmon. Everything was good. Staff was very accommodating and very friendly. Will definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and the service from Lisa and Sam was great. We all had something different and every dish was loved by all."}
{"text":"This isn't real Cajun food. I order jambalaya and requested it extra spicy, it wasn't near spicy. If you're claiming to be a Cajun restaurant make it how you'd make it down in Louisiana. SPICY! they said that the original way they made it (which is not what they brought out to me) was too spicy to some ppl... But What do they expect it's Cajun food it's supposed to be spicy. Service was good though."}
{"text":"I LOVE Lola's! I have been to Lola's twice now, and both experiences were outstanding. The first time I went to Lola's it was to celebrate my birthday. We wanted to find a downtown location that could accommodate a large group. After several failed attempts at making reservations at other downtown eateries, my friend called Lola's. We were able to make a reservation for 17 without any trouble. When we arrived, I was surprised to see what a small space it was. Even though it's such a humble space, we didn't feel cramped. Everyone in the group, even the picky eaters, were able to find something on the menu that tickled their fancy. The food all came out at the same time which is something I truly appreciate when dining with a large group. 
On my first visit I tried the gumbo and crab cakes. Not only were they delicious, but the presentation of the crab cakes is adorable with cursive L's drawn in tasty lemon-garlic aioli. Everyone in the group was pleased with their choices. Some people in our group were a little surprised by how spicy their meals were. Word to the wise, if the menu says \"spicy\" don't take it lightly! I had the bread pudding for dessert, and it was tasty too! Everyone agreed that one highlight of the meal was the bread. It is sliced thin and lightly grilled. The bread is pillowy and has just the right amount of crunch. Yum! They also have a nice selection of Abita beer. 
As we left, they wished me a happy birthday, and I promised we would be back soon. I kept true to my word, and we ate dinner there again tonight. We had the hot crab and artichoke dip. It came out piping hot, and did not disappoint. I had the Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya. It is a generous portion and very flavorful. Tonight's dessert special was peach cobbler. It was totally perfect. 
The service was friendly and efficient. Lola's has quickly become a favorite! Next time, I think I may try one of their Po-Boys with sweet potato fries...mmm."}
{"text":"My daughter treated me to a four day vacation in Vegas.  She had researched restaurants for our \"Foodie\" trip.  Lola's was on her list and I am glad that it was.  We went on Fat Tuesday and thoroughly enjoyed.  I had the Catfish and Stringbeans and my daughter had the Oysters and greens.  It was at the top of our list of restaurants.  If you are looking for authenic cajun food, may I suggest Lola's."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place, and I'm so glad I finally checked it out.  Outstanding Cajun cooking.  I had the shrimp and grits, which was absolutely delicious!  My husband had the jambalaya and loved it.  The service was good.  It's a cute spot - very small but cute.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience. My crab cake was good BUT, it had huge pieces of crab shell in it and it almost chipped my tooth and I don't mean a little piece of shell because that is understandable but I could tell you exactly where the piece of hard shell came from(claws, legs, and it body..and it wasn't a leg shell). I did takeout and it took an hour just to get my food and I was hoping that well hopefully I will have a great experience with the food...NO NO NO I ordered the blackened catfish Po'Boy as well and my fries were burnt, very flimsy no crispness, and they weren't hot. Oh I did have one crisp fry that wasn't burnt...Like the fries were fried this morning and been sitting there all day and they mixed in a fresh batch just to make it seem like they were just fried or they recooked them. Then my Po'Boy uhhh where do I start!!! The fish was very bland and I don't understand how it can be bland and it's blackened. It definitely needed salt for taste. Waaaay to much mayo and the tartar sauce tasted like unflavored mayo. So in my mouth I just taste a bunch of oily based spread. The bread was stale so when I bit into it..well I tried to. The whole inside slipped out and I was left with still trying to tear a bite off the bread. Overall I give it a BIG ZERO. That's why either Guy Fieri only talked about the Beef Debris Po'Boy because everything else was nasty or they allowed for the recognition to go to their head and now they don't care about the food quality...and I'm guessing the second part is right because I had autographs on both of my takeout containers and I didn't even ask for it. Thank you LOLA'S for the horrible experience I will never come back."}
{"text":"Lola's Cajun food restaurant in Las Vegas did not give the experience I so hoped the first and second time I ate there.  I believe in second chances so I wrote off the first unpleasant experience because I really wanted to like this place.  After the last experience I had there I will not be visiting it again even though it is a few blocks from my home.  

My boyfriend and i arrived and were handed menus by the hostess who said, \" there is only two tables outside I trust you can find it.\"  This is not a seat yourself kind of place but we were happy to oblige.  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp po-boy and I ordered the beans and rice.  After about 30 min. we were still patiently waiting for our food, after 45 we asked to get it to go because we could no longer wait.  As if by happenstance our food came out within the next min. we were given to-go boxes at the same time that way if we wanted to take a few bites before packing it up we could.  IT WAS COLD!  The sweet potatoes were cold the rice was cold... everything was cold... I did not receive the bread nor the coleslaw it was supposed to come with either.  I went to the hostess to inform her of the situation.  She offered to put it in the microwave for us to heat it up, other than that there was nothing else she could do but get Lola.  However they just had a very large to go order and Lola was working on the line.  ( I am sorry I wish they would have told me in advance that they would not be able to accommodate my order because they had a very large order to take care of.)  

I went back to the table and sat.  Our bill was promptly brought to us and then my boyfriend questioned the quality of the food with the time waited to the waitress.  She offered to get Lola but other than that there was nothing else she could do... we paid and waited some more.  She still did not come.  Finally on our last effort at realizing we just wasted $25 on food that was not fresh we went back to the door and requested Lola; just to be told that Lola was busy and could not come out. I am very disappointed in my experience at this place.  I love to support local businesses especially in the downtown neighborhood, however this place will not be one of them.  Maybe I am used to Vegas hospitality, so this \"southern hospitality\" is nothing in comparison.   

Lola's southern food in las vegas is not cheap and not good."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced in my life.  Our server, not sure of his name because he literally didn't say more than 5 words to us the whole time we ate there, was HORRIBLE.  He had black rimmed glasses with black hair and a beard. If you dine here beware of him! Ask for Megan, she was fantastic! The only server that smiled, literally. She refilled our drinks, brought out our food and cleared our food. Not even sure where our server was. The restaurant is super tiny yet he was no where to be found.  I'm also a server at a restaurant on the strip and I almost lost my cool with this guy.  He didn't even drop our check, another random server did.  Just a really miserable person who should not be waiting tables for a living. It's unfortunate too because the food is good. When you have someone treat you like you don't exist and acts like he could give a shit it ruins the whole experience.  Will most definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Took a friend from out-of-town for lunch last week. My first time too, but I had heard good things about it. The food was indeed excellent. I had a soft shell crab as an app and he a cup of gumbo. Next was shrimp and grits, and my buddy had the catfish and grits. GREAT! However, we came hungry and had to spend $60 (only one beer) to get full. Not huge eaters, but portions could be more generous. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Yum!

We had two work lunches there and we had a great time both times.  The first time we went, they made a mistake on two orders, but other than that, all the food came out great and we were stuffed and happy afterwards.

Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"My two favorite restaurants in the world are Alfredo's in Rome and Commanders Palace in New Orleans.  Sadly, Commander's Palace recently closed.  Thankfully, I discovered Lola's!  Amazing Cajun food.  The catfish and grits is the absolute best I've ever had anywhere. The staff is great and you just can't find better food in Vegas.  Way to go Lola!"}
{"text":"To all you fellow DDD watchers and fans of Guy Fiere's picks:  This place is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!  We traveled to LV with another couple and wanted to seek out several of Guy's picks while we were in town - well Lola's was the only one we visited during this trip, and I have to say it (again) - it truly deserves the five stars I gave it.  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating......  Yes, the place is small - but we were \"lucky\" enough that this wasn't an issue for us - having lunch on a Friday afternoon.  ALL of the dishes we ordered were quite delicious! 

(1)    We ordered two orders of the Crab Cake appetizer - OFF THE CHARTS!  We've had Crab Cakes in various other restaurants around the country - and Lola's beat them all hands down!

(2)    We ordered a few side dishes to go with our meals - all were tasty.... Fries, Coleslaw.... Garlic Bread.....

(3)    We ordered several main dishes and shared them among the four of us - all of these dishes were TRULY Extraordinary!....  Shrimp Creole..... Blackened Shrimp with Grits.....Salad with Blackened Salmon.....  all of these dishes were Flavorful, Delicious, Spectacular....... need I say more?"}
{"text":"great Cajun food, worth the stop. the staff were friendly and had quick service.  will make this a must stop whenever in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food in front of North Premium Outlet. Crab and artichoke dip was a 10! Ordered another, first one didn't last.  grits, soft shell crab and shrimp were great!
Loved all the food."}
{"text":"My wife's from New Orleans and she absolutely loves the food here. She says it reminds her of home. The staff us extremely friendly and it was a quite, comfy atmosphere. The first Friday every month they also have live music."}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  As someone who enjoys Louisiana cuisine, yum.  The downtown location is not very large but the food is to die for.  Everyone packs in to enjoy their dining experience and I am sure they are not disappointed.  One of my foodie friends from NYC introduced me to this location last year while visiting.  There were even nice enough to make my vegetarian wife a special vegetarian po'boy so she was not left out.  I plan on getting the shrimp and grits next visit.  Tried some from my friend's dish, yum."}
{"text":"The great taste of New Orleans in the heart of Las Vegas. Kind of cramped (hey! a chance to make new friends) The food is awesome."}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch around 2. The place was not real busy but had customers. An hour and twenty minutes later after others had come in after us, sit down, ordered, served there food, ate, got their check, paid and left, we still had not got our food yet. The server blamed it on the kitchen burning our catfish. There was only three of us. The food was not that good. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when a friend invited me to check out Lola's for their crawfish. This was my first crawfish boil and it certainly lived up to it's expectations.

It was nice out that day and Lola's had a nice little patio to dine but I wanted to experience the whole Louisiana ambiance so we decided to dine inside. The decor had a new Orleans theme going on but the one thing that caught my eye were the vibrant paintings. You can certainly tell that the owner shows a lot pride and passion form where she is from through the decor.

So let's get to the nitty gritty \"THE FOOD\". I was disappointed at their beer selection. They had the typical Budwiser, millers, etc. But they only had two Abita beer selections and for those beer lovers Abita is brewed in Louisiana. Although they had only two, much props for having the SOS (save our shore) which was brewed as a charitable beer for the most recent oil spill in the gulf. This again reflected the owners passion to her home town. We went there for the crawfish so we ordered the 5 lb special and after seeing it come out it was well worth the 41.99 price. There were only two of us and the 5 lbs would be good for 4 people. It was time to get in \"caveman\" mode, took the first crawfish ripped off the head and sucked it's delicious juices. The seasoning was perfect, there was a little kick to it but not too spicy where it overwhelms your palette. The tail meat was sweet, with the taste of shrimp and the texture of lobster. \"Crawfish the poor mans lobster\". I didn't care much for the claws so I kindly shared them with my friend who had more patience cracking them open. I skipped on the potatoes and corn that came with the boil because I just couldn't stop eating the crawfish.

Overall my first crawfish boil experience was a very good one and plan to come back to try Lola's other dishes. So if your from Louisiana and live in Vegas, I'm sure you'll feel a little closer to home when you eat at Lola's."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place. The food was great and I will mos def go back again. And Lola was an awesome host. If you are looking for a good place to eat that is off the strip go to Lola's. Yum Yum."}
{"text":"I just had the strangest thing happen. At 815 I approached the hostess and I was informed that there was a 10 minute wait. The next thing out of her mouth was you will have to order fast because the kitchen closes in 10 minutes. This made no sense. Why would the kitchen close at the same time we were going to be seated?

So after that the hostess said if you are in town for a couple of days I could make a reservation.  Why she assumed I was a tourist is beyond me."}
{"text":"While in Vegas I visited Lola's A Louisiana Kitchen on Charleston near \"Downtown LV\"and tried the Seafood Gumbo and I must say I had a orgasm in my mouth lol !!! The Gumbo was authentic Louisiana gumbo I give that place a rating of 10+++ me and the hubby killed that little cup of Gumbo. When in Vegas visiting check Lola's out you won't be disappointed :-)"}
{"text":"Was invited to a group dinner of 6 on Saturday, January 29th:

This was my first visit.  The atmosphere was quaint and quiet.

The server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I ordered the New Orleans Style BBQ Shrimp.  Before ordering, the server made sure that I understood what I was ordering.  He excitedly described the dish and I was sold, along with another member of our party.

The meal arrived and looked great.  Five large shrimp, U-20's I think, on top a bed of rice, soaked with the spicy Cajun style sauce that the shrimp were slow cooked in.  Cayenne pepper was on the rim of the plate that immediately cleared my sinuses. 

I ate with delight, took some bread from my girlfriend's catfish po-boy (which was also delicious) and mopped up the sauce.  The meal was delicious and not overwhelmingly filling.

One of our party members ordered the bread pudding for dessert.  I tried a bite and it was fantastic.

Will definitely be back and recommend to many."}
{"text":"Seen this on Triple D, so we had to stop. We got the deep fried oysters, soft shell crab and crawfish. Everything was awesome!"}
{"text":"The best soft shell crab po boy I have ever had. Portions are perfect and the service is great. Absolutely a must try"}
{"text":"We were staying on the Strip, but heard about Lola's.  I'm a huge shrimp & grits fan and the reviews were pretty strong.  So we hopped a cab and headed out for breakfast.  According to google, the restaurant opens at 11a on Sat.  However, we got there and found the place didn't open until 12pm; so that was a bit disappointing.  It's kind of in the middle of nowhere, so there wasn't anyplace easy to walk to.  Thank goodness they had some chairs outside in the shade.  So we chose to sit and wait till opening.  One of the managers was kind enough to bring us some ice water and around 11:45a, allowed us to come inside until they were ready to start service.  

So on to the good stuff - THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC!!  I will say their bronzed shrimp & grits ranks in my top three.  It comes in this phenomenal ragoutl!  It was so full of flavor; I couldn't stop eating it.  I don't like mushrooms, but I ate every freakin' mushroom in that ragout.  I also had the red beans & rice.  Again, super good.  I was completely satisfied."}
{"text":"The red beans, rice, and andouille sausage gets an A, and the portion size is huge.  The shrimp creole gets a B.  This place does not have alligator po-boys, remoulade sauce, or beignets.  Had to ding them for a star because of that."}
{"text":"Have you been away from New Orleans too long? Are you missing some authentic Cajun or Creole cooking? If you answered yes to those questions as well as others you have then get to Lola's. Guy Fieri came into town and did a segment of \"Diners, Drive-in's and Dives\" from Lola's. If you are visiting or a local, if Guy can come here, you should make it to Lola's as well.

If you have been away from New Orleans too long, Lola's will make you feel right at home. The decor reminds me of the pleasures of sitting in a New Orleans Cafe eating gumbo and a great piece of Pecan Pie. Not only does the decor make me feel that way, but the food served at Lola's gives me the tastes I remember as well. Gumbo, po boys and more will make you feel like you are back in New Orleans. I'm sure there is someplace in town to get some great Beignets.

I almost forgot to mention the service at Lola's. The service is always great and I feel well taken care of whenever I go. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas for a trade show and we just had to get out of that hotel - it started feeling like a prison!  Used Yelp to find Lola's.

From the moment we walked in the door Lola's was just perfect.  Ice cold Abita beer really hit the spot.  The service was proper and attentive.

The four of us enjoyed the broiled oysters, hush puppies and crab cakes for appetizers.  

For my entree I had the bronzed catfish - it was poetry on a plate!  Order this.  It is just that simple.

Fininshed off with Bananas Foster.  Yum Yum.

If you are Las Vegas and want to get out of the casino and have a real dinner I recommend Lola's."}
{"text":"I decided before heading to LV that I would visit restaurants based on yelp reviews.  Lola's was one of them.  I was never so dissappointed.  There were four of us, so I actually got a chance to try 2 other dishes.  The catfish was over cooked and salty, the fried shrimp were huge, but with absolutely no taste, the jambalaya looked like a bowl of red paste.  I did read in a previous review that the service was not good.  There was only one waitress during our visit and she was hurried."}
{"text":"Lovely place with patio seating. Shrimp and grits did not disappoint. A great microbrew offering."}
{"text":"Gumbo sucks....bad. I was disappointed.
I am from the south and eat/cook Cajun food regularly.
The crawfish were salty... Not spicy.
I only ate these two items... Otherwise the staff was friendly, and as I looked around I saw some very well put together plates."}
{"text":"i had been wanting to check out Lola's since it opened. my girlfriend and i decided to go on a Saturday night i had previously made reservations we were told that it would be a five minute wait we decided to wait in the bar, i ordered a hurricane which was absolutely horrid to say the least. 25 minutes later we were taken to the back of the restaurant where it contained temporary table and chairs which were uncomfortable to say the least.

Approximately 20 minutes after being seated the waitress arrived and apologized for the wait. We asked for suggestions and one of the suggestions that was made were the edible crabs which we ordered the crabs were drenched in grease which tasted like the oil was old. 2nd dish was fish and grits which were average gumbo not so great.

the service was awful the waitress spent her time talking to other waitress in the bar area for long lengths of time and came to our table three times once to deliver the food and again after we finished eating  we waited 15 minutes for the bill to arrive our waitress finally arrived at the table after we spoke to the bust man and requested a check she arrived and  asked how was the food and would we like dessert ? approximately 10 minutes later the bill arrived."}
{"text":"Since I grew up in La, I'll go ahead and consider myself an expert in judging the authenticity of the cuisine. After so many bad experiences with restaurants that serve \"real\" Cajun food, it is great to find one that really does! Lola's is as real as it gets. I had the bronze catfish and grits, outstanding, and followed it up with a nice warm piece of sweet potato pecan pie, equally good. Prices were right and the service was spot on. I HIGHLY recommend Lola's!"}
{"text":"Go here and eat!
Bread pudding was worth the trip. 
After 15 years in NOLA I moved to Michigan and when I ate here ... I was back uptown.
Cold beer, great food, friendly atmosphere, fantastic service, and the prices were fair. 
 My only complaint ... don't say D'brees and Po-Boy without making a \"Mothers\" style debris roast beef Po-Boy."}
{"text":"Having been to New Orleans many times, I find this the best Creole Restaurant outside of the French Quarter.
We made a last minute reservation, and although the place was full, they had an overflow area that we ended up in.  It was quiet and we loved the atmosphere.
Will go back during our next visit, and also try the larger restaurant in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Ordered a po-boy with blackened shrimp.  The shrimp was so oversalted it was inedible.  Had gumbo as replacement, it was passable but nothing special.  My wife had crawfish ettoufe which was good, but overall I don't recommend the food here."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! 

My mom and I were driving along Charleston Blvd when we came across this place. This was my first attempt at Cajun Food - let me tell you, it's DELICIOUS! 

I had the Blackened Catfish with Grits. Never had Catfish nor Grits before, so needless to say, I was super apprehensive. Coming from Hawaii where Spam is King, Catfish and Grits are not exactly on the menu everyday.  But, I was assured by the super nice Waiter that it's Lola's special and that I would not be disappointed. 

When the dish came out, it was more than I could have expected! The cajun spices were amazing - it has a spicy bite, but not to the point where you are dying for water. It's the perfect combination to the flaky soft fish. Combined with the grits and mushroom sauce...omg...it's a party in your mouth. 

Fast forward to dessert, my mom has a sweet tooth so she had to have something. But, she couldn't decide between the Bread Pudding and the Banana Fosters. Lo and behold, Lola herself comes out and suggests the Banana Fosters Bread Pudding. Apparently, a lot of other people were in the same predicament and so Lola combined the two desserts into one. 

If you go here, you must try the Banana Fosters Bread Pudding. Words will not do it justice, so I will not even try to attempt to express how amazing this dessert it. Go there. Try it. I promise - you will not be disappointed. 

Lola is the nicest lady ever - she came out from the Kitchen and greeted every single table. When she stopped by our table, she greeted us like family and immediately made us feel like we've known her for years! 

Bottom line, this place is a MUST GO when in Vegas. Good Food, Good Service and Good People. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Small and cozy, this place has a great comfortable atmosphere, excellent service and all of the food just matches as well.  Fried shrimp PoBoy, roast beef debris as well, Gumbo is fantastic, bananna pudding like my mom made, and of course Lola herself to round it out.  GO THERE you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time actually and I love the shrimp and grits. The combo plate is my next favorite, and bananas foster after. Yah, this place gets busy and it is worth it."}
{"text":"I am very fond of Lola's.  My boyfriend and I had dinner on Friday night - which is their big crawfish night.  - I can't remember if they do all you can eat crawfish or if it's just on special.

Anyhow, we've been there twice.  The first time we went on a Sunday night and it was really quiet as it was just before closing time.  Our server advised that we come in on a Friday night to have crawfish.  My boyfriend is from a small town in Louisiana and LOVES crawfish.  So, we ended up coming back to eat on First Friday. 

The atmosphere was great.  There was a great band playing and it was very laid back.  We did have to wait for about 15 to 20 minutes for a table, because it was at the peak of dinner time.  Plus, this isn't the type of place where you eat and leave right away.  It's nice to sit back, have a beer, and just talk.  

The food is delicious.  We ordered about five pounds of crawfish, the crab dip, and for dessert, we had bananas foster and bread pudding.  The dessert was wonderful.  I'd go just for dessert!  

I think they could definitely work on being a bit more organized when it comes to seating.  My boyfriend gets cranky when he is hungry and made a comment that there were two tables that had been empty for about five to ten minutes that just needed to be bussed.  I was enjoying the weather and the band - as they have an outdoor patio.  Plus, I always think to have a small snack before we go anywhere new - just so that I'm not starving if we have to wait to be seated.  

I personally love the atmosphere.  I adore downtown Las Vegas - as it is the closest thing that we have to history and art in this town.  I know that we have the fine art galleries on the strip - but I love being able to experience a city and its people doing normal things like gathering for dinner.  

I really hope Lola's just gets better.  I'm a fan and hope to stay one :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went with two other couples. Had reservations which is a must. AMAZING experience. Food was unbelievable. Peel and eat shrimp, crab cake, craw puppies, jambalaya, catfish, it was all so good. We finished with desert. Chocolate cake was nothing to write home about but everyone loved the bread pudding, both standard and bananas foster bread pudding. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Lola's this past Saturday evening at about 6:30 or so, and there was a 30 minute wait. The staff was polite and we had a beer while waiting in chairs outside.

The food was underwhelming. They brought out some grilled bread after we had been seated for maybe 15 minutes, and there was no butter or olive oil, and if there was any already on the bread, you couldn't taste it.

I had a crab cake appetizer that was utterly mediocre. My wife had a fried soft shell crab that was also mediocre, and it cost $14 I believe because the price had gone up that day.

I had jambalaya, and it was just a starchy mass of rice with some of this and that tossed in. I had better jambalaya at the Orleans buffet to be 100 percent honest.

My wife had shrimp and grits. She is from the south and she loves grits, and she said the portion was skimpy and it tasted too cheesy. I tasted it and I thought the grits were overly cheesy as well.

She got pecan and sweet potato pie for dessert and she thought it was incredibly good. 

I got a good feeling about the place at its root, but the food wasn't all that great to be honest. I can't say that I'm anxious to return."}
{"text":"Just to get to the point, ....First time to Lola's, the food was ok... Our server was dual, didn't seen to want to give us any extra time in answering our questions, fake smile and made me feel like she was not happy to be of service.  The bus boys were nice and attentive.  The server ruined the whole experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Lola's on a recent trip to Las Vegas.  It was highly recommended by a co worker, who's husband is from Louisiana so I trust her opinion.  We arrived about 5:15 PM on a Saturday without reservations.  The hostess said no tables were available but we could sit at the bar.  We were glad to have a spot!  We were served the most delicious grilled bread!  It was so light and airy with just a hint of butter and garlic.  The basket was empty in 5 minutes.  We ordered a small bowl of gumbo which was very good and then ordered the BBQ shrimp and the shrimp and grits for dinner.   Both were very flavorful without being too salty or hot, and we were sad when our plates were empty.  The BBQ shrimp was spicy but not overwhelming so.  It was served with rice and that great bread to soak up all the juice.  My husband had to hold off from licking the plate clean!  The grits were  creamy and cheesy and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.  Its hard to find good grits in the West, but they do them right here.  We ordered the roast beef debris to go for our lunch on Sunday but had to pass on dessert.  Though i am told the bread pudding and Bananas Foster are wonderful.  The place was filled to the gills and the wait staff was hustling, but even sitting at the bar, we received our food in good time, and our waitress was lovely.  We met and chatted with Lola and her husband who were very  approachable.  This is on our permanent  \"must do\" list on our next trip to Las Vegas.  It's about a 5-10 drive from the strip on the I 15 N depending on traffic, but easy to find in the old Holsum Bread warehouse.  Do yourself a flavor favor: skip the hotel buffet and get yourself to Lola's!"}
{"text":"We've been to Lola's a few times over the years, and if anything they are consistently good and give great customer service! They have the best Cajun food we have eaten in Las Vegas, and my daughter requested we go there since she loves their dishes. The day we went for lunch, they were having problems with their computer and orders were being sent to the kitchen manually, which caused some service issues and delays since they were super busy (as always). Our hostess explained the problem to us, then brought out a complimentary bowl of their fantastic shrimp and grits for us to snack on while we waited for our food--wow! I wanted to try an Abita beer with my jambalaya, and our waiter suggested the Abita Turbodog, a brown ale that was smooth, refreshing and paired up well with my spicy meal! And the bread they brought out was also great--light, crunchy crust while nice and soft inside, perfect with our crab and artichoke dip! Thank you, Lola's--keep up the good cooking!"}
{"text":"Love the food and would highly recommend!! customer service until today was great even during busy lunch hours. today i was seated in the middle row at 2 person table and while my friend was signing her check to finish paying we were told that they were going to join another table with ours because they were going to seat somebody there once we left. when i looked at her surprised she would say this to us. she says oh i am not telling you to leave or feel rushed but we also need room for people to walk by in the aisle...........although we have been there now for about 45mins and no waitresses were having trouble getting by nor have i ever seen this happened the countless times i have visited this establishment. i thought very highly of this place but now i wonder if you are just not trying to push people in and out to serve as many as you can. Also believe me i am very mindful of other people waiting, when i am done i try my best to get out so that the next person can enjoy the food there because i know when i wait i would hope i would get the same consideration."}
{"text":"Great food! The barbecue shrimp is stupid good. Don't miss out on the broiled oysters"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The food is always good but the portions are a little small.
 
I really like the jambalaya but the best is the CRAWFISH!!!! I would go back just for the crawfish, they are much less oily and more flavorful than Hot-and-Juicy's.

I do wish that they had beer on tap, but oh well, bottled beer is better than no beer!"}
{"text":"I am not a natural fan of Southern food, since I am from the West, but Lola's is worth your experimenting! I LOVE the peel-and-eat shrimp and the Southern specialty beers.  I ask the waiter for his or her recommendation and I've never been disappointed. But be ready for some HEAT!"}
{"text":"Not sure I understand some of the low ratings - this is a terrific little restaurant.  I get to Las Vegas 3-4 times a year and its a regular stop: in part because the food is reliably good, and in part because the staff and owner are so damn nice.  I'm a sucker for a Po Boy...and Lola's had me at the bread: spot on what you'd expect in the best sandwich joint in New Orleans.

Lola's passion for her work and for her people is clear - I spent some time chatting with them today at lunch & was really impressed by the fact that they love what they do.  

Sorry Tierney and anyone else who says they had a bad experience at Lola's - with respect, I disagree.  I'll go to Lola's over any of the overpriced celebrity-joints on the Strip anytime."}
{"text":"Saw this place on triple d finally got around to trying it. This place was really good. Having been to New Orleans this place is as close to being there as you can get. When you first walk in you can tell its a New Orleans place with all of the saint pictures every where. I had the crawfish corn balls which were excellent. Next I had the fried shrimp po-boy which the bread is from the famous bakery from New Orleans which is a must have. Last but not least I had the pecan sweet potato pie which I really enjoyed. If you love Cajun food like I do give this place a try."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path  but so totally worth it. Don't be fooled by the location this place is great. Service is wonderful but is actually second to the amazing food. Gumbo is so great.   Make sure to save room to try the bread pudding."}
{"text":"Great salads but I've had better pastas; however I still go there all the time for lunches and it's always busy there"}
{"text":"Never knew about this place until looking for a coffee shop in the area one day and saw their sign. Needless to say, I was shocked and excited. So excited for authentic La. food that I booked a reservation the same week.

Good thing too because when my party and I arrived,  it was packed but we were seated right away. Had we not made one, there would've been a wait. The place is very quaint but there's outside patio seating which is nice.

Our server was a gem. She was so sweet. Unfortunately,  I don't remember her name. However, if I could describe her,  she was about 5' 4\", blonde hair shoulder length, but parted and w/ one braid on each side. (Eek...hope that helps)

Being that the first leg of my vacation recently was in NOLA, I wanted to try something new. So I ordered the Catfish (nuggets) & grits made w/ actual gouda cheese. I'm not really a fan of Gouda but the smokey flavor of the grits was pretty good. And the catfish was amazing! 

My son ordered Gumbo but kept eating my food!! (The nerve). He started w/ the crab cake for starters which he loved!

So eventually since most of my food had been eaten, I was forced to eat his Gumbo. (Really tasty..btw). Portion size with each meal was perfect. 

And on to dessert....do yourself a favor and order the sweet potato pecan pie!! I died and went to heaven for about two whole minutes. Jesus wouldn't let me stay,  He told me we should order another one, so I had to oblige!! 

Since my party and I DEVOURED the first one, we ordered a second one, even after the bill had arrived! 
The crust just melted in your mouth.. and the combination of warm sweet potato with pecans...just sinful! Woohhh!!

Lastly..The atmosphere, with the combination of the decor, the music and the pleasant staff really took me back to NOLA. The only thing missing was that NOLA accent which I love! Ahh well... can't have everything right?

My party and I left full and happy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"O.M.G.  Listen, the Southerner in me is always looking for a good spot to catch some grits . . . and this place does not disappoint!  I've been here twice - both times got the shrimp and grits - and both times left a happy Southern girl.

Absolutely fantastic lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm normally not in this area often, but talk about a tucked away GEM of a Resturant!!! Granted they have only been opened since 09, but I have to say ... I'm making this place the spot to get my Cajun on!!! I had the catfish platter and the New Orleans brewed beer and it was \"all\" very tasty!!! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!! Don't dare go there and not try the smoked Gouda cheese grits.  Even if you are not crazy about grits.....you will love these. A \"must place to visit \" every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Lola's. The food is always great, but the service can be hit or miss depending on what time of day you stop in. If they're busy, be prepared for a wait and during crawfish season- calling ahead for a reservation is a must. 

My favorite things to order, other than the crawfish are the crawpupppies and charbroiled oysters. For the main entrees, I love the crawfish étouffée, shrimp n grits, bronzed catfish, and the jumbalaya. And for dessert? The bread pudding is to die for and you can order it as bananas foster bread pudding with the sauce and ice cream- so good."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Lola's!  We've been going there since she opened.  We're transplants from the New Orleans area.  Her food is as good as we can get without hopping on a plane to Louisiana.  The atmosphere is quaint and casual so much like several of the eating establishments in the N.O. area.  The staff is friendly and we always feel like we're home every time we visit.  Our favorites; shrimp and grits, crab cakes and her fried catfish.  Don't go if you're trying to diet, that's not her style.  Highly recommend if you've got just a little \"southern\" in ya!"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place on Aug. 7, 2011 thru  YELP.  We did not make a mistake and so are the people praising this establishment. From the moment we went in, we felt relaxed and ready to order.  Too bad I forgot the name of the lady that waited on us because she is so charming and helpful that she'll try to accommodate your requests.  I ordered the bronzed catfish, but I also want to taste the shrimp.  She said that they can make it half and half and not very spicy.  My husband ordered the seafood platter with mussels, shrimps, oysters, fish. Wow the flavor of the food was soooo goooood.  And the price is very reasonable. The place is very clean and did I already say that the people are the sweetest.  Will definitely come back here whenever we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Blackened Shrimp Po-boy was UNREAL. Also, save room for dessert because the bread pudding was the best I've ever had. Lola's got it."}
{"text":"This is for the Summerlin location on Town Center... Heard about Lola's for years and how good it was so I had VERY high expectations. Saw that they opened up a location within minutes of my home and couldn't wait to go.

Unfortunately......

This place certainly did not meet my expectations.. 

Blue Crab cake --- Pretty much nothing but filling. 

Service was good. Wonderful waitress.

Service plus the Grits saved this review from being a 1.

Had the Catfish and Grits... GF had the Shrimp and Grits. Nothing but Cayenne for flavor but the grits were fantastic. (Enough cheese and butter... pretty easy to make good tasting grits.)

For desert... Bananas Foster which certainly missed the mark. 

All in all, the Lola's in Summerlin didn't meet our expectations."}
{"text":"It was very busy when we dropped in on last Saturday night.  We were politely greeted and told it would be about a 20 minute wait.  We were seated however in just 10 minutes at the bar where we chose to eat.  It has a nice Louisiana ambiance without trying too hard to fit a theme. 

The service was impeccable.  We ordered the crawfish etouffee.  It had a beautifully developed chocolate brown roux.  Also ordered were the shrimp po-boy, chicken jambalaya and crab cakes.  We sampled each other's order and agreed the etouffee was the best overall.  The shrimp was also superb.  Least favorite, but still good were the crab cakes.  It had good flavor and presentation, but the texture was a bit too uniform with the crab meat well blended into the crumb mixture.

Sitting at the bar you get a nice view of the grill where you can see them fire up the oysters.  It is a great up sell just watching it.  We will try them when we visit again."}
{"text":"Since I am a creole, I have been wanting try this place and equally staying away for years because it couldn't possibly be authentic. I finally came around when it was time for my bf and I to go to smith center for the tempest. And thankfully, it was delicious. The place is small and we were given the table next to the kitchen (even though we had a reservation) but we didn't care as soon as the food was in front of us. My bf has étouffée with extra rice and I had the BBQ shrimp. My only gripe would be that in Louisiana, the shrimp are served head and shell on, which adds extra rich flavor but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. We will be back to try the po boys!"}
{"text":"The food definitely lives up to the hype. (I find myself dreaming about the Bronzed Shrimp & Grits between trips to Vegas!...) The location is a little deceiving; tucked inside an unassuming hole-in-the-wall in an industrial park just outside of downtown, it looks closed when you drive by. But open the door, and you feel like you've just stepped into a New Orleans party! One star off because the service isn't consistent, and they tend to forget about you at the end when you're waiting for your check. But the food is so good, we almost don't mind. Just don't leave without trying the bread pudding with Jim Beam sauce!! #YUM"}
{"text":"Best Cajun ever!! My roommate is from Louisiana, so I have had my share of authentic Cajun cuisine, and I dare say Lola's took the cake. 

Wowww. We ate the following:

1) Crawfish hushpuppies and they melted in our mouths like butter and were perfect. The bread they serve is flown in directly from Louisiana and it is the most sumptuous, airy, perfectly toasted, and perfecty buttered bread I've ever had in my life. 

2) Catfish and grits. This is their speciality and the server was so excited about this dish that we could not pass it up. Amazing does not even begin to describe the perfect blend of spices and textures of the catfish and the grits. The bread they provided you was also a necessity to sop up all of the delicious sauce that came with this dish!

3) Banana's foster. It doesn't look like it's on their menu anymore, but I wanted to eat at least a pound of it. It was heavenly and yes, the best Banana's foster I ever had. It was the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

If you are in Vegas, you must stop by this place if you love Cajun. It is off the strip, but it's worth it for food that is decently priced, but does not skimp on flavor. The staff is equally nice as well, and are so enthusiastic about the food they serve that it adds to the overall experience. :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find thanks to Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives! It is close to the casinos in old downtown Vegas so if you're staying on the Strip, I highly recommend a stop at Lola's on the way to Freemont Street if you want to explore downtown.

I enjoyed my Roast Beef Po' Boy. My friends raved about their Catfish and Grits and their Shrimp and Grits. Fantastic selection of Abita beers from Louisiana. The only knock on them is that the parking situation was confusing...everything else was better than we expected."}
{"text":"Cajun Food was Googled for Las Vegas and this is the Restaurant we found.  I am very glad that we went there  for our Monday night YELP dinner.    Charbroiled Oysters and Crab & Artichoke dip was ordered for an appetizer, all was delicious.  There was huge chunks  of Crab in the Crab & Artichoke Dip, Yummy!  For Entrees we ordered Shrimp Charlotte, A Fish Combo Meal which included Catfish, Fried Oysters, Fried Shrimp & a Cajun Crab Cake, Chicken & Sausage Jambalaya, and a 3 lb order of Crawfish.    Since this was our first time eating Cajun we had no idea how to properly eat Crawfish.  Lola came out, introduced herself and was very helpful in showing us the Best way to enjoy our meal.  She was very pleasant and greeted everyone at their tables.  We passed on dessert this night due to over eating but were told that the desserts were well worth it.  When we go back, we will leave room for dessert.  Two glasses of wine and two beers were ordered and our total bill was $123.00.  Give this restaurant a try, everything was delicious and  the service and music was good."}
{"text":"Great customer service and customer interaction.  Best grits I've ever had.  Catfish was good as well. My friend had the shrimp & grits and it was also really well."}
{"text":"As a native of South Louisiana, I have to say that the food was excellent. Lola's is also the only place in town where we've found a large selection of Abita beer. The only downside to our visit was that they ran out of Abita Strawgator on draft. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Our server was Sam and she was terrific even though a nasty customer was yelling at her because she didn't like the gumbo. We had the gumbo and it was excellent. Sam kept her cool. Very professional."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicios food! Reminded us of eating in new orleans . Well be back."}
{"text":"Awesome Cajun creole food.  Love the shrimp and grits.  Looks just like a local Cajun restaurant in Louisiana.  We always have dinner at Lola's when in town.  You can not go wrong.  Good prices and service is great!  Can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time here.  Super close quarters but adds to the charm.   Friendly staff.   Waitress very nice and informative.   Beer and wine selection is pretty big.   We ordered crab cake for starter.   Soooooo gooooood.  Shrimp and grits and blackened salmon for dinner.  Both, seriously were amazing.   Dessert the bananas fosters bread pudding.  Don't mess around just order that.  It was heaven.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Neat little joint near downtown. It has a homey feel that you don't see too much in Vegas. Food is average but definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Holy Cow ' ! The kind of food you dream of....shrimp and Grits amazing! Bread pudding fabulous ! Service excellent!!! You rock Lola! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Lola's.  So much so, that I convinced three co-workers to go. We put in our order immediately and ended up waiting almost an hour for our food to come out.  When our food (porboys) came, it turned out to be a very small portion.  I couldn't even taste the catfish on my sandwich because it was so small.  For the price, I feel there should have at least been another piece of catfish on my sandwich.  The sauce on the sandwich was good, and so was the cole slaw.  When the server was asked if it normally takes this long for your order to be ready, he was not very pleasant with his response.  Overall, this was not a very good experience.  I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"When you come to Vegas and you want to break free from the overpriced franchise crap on the strip, this is your place. Everything is delicious, made fresh and plenty of it. Very affordable and an experience different than most of Vegas. Take the 5 minute drive from the strip and enjoy. 
SHRIMP AND GRITS!!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and the service great. Having said that it the food was not as authentic as what you will find in New Orleans. If you are not going to be visiting the Big Easy anytime soon this will work just do not set your expectations too high."}
{"text":"Staying in Vegas for a family vacation and wanted some good \"off the strip\" eating. Found Lola's on yelp and decided to try it. To start we had the hush puppies, crab dip and oysters. I could have done without the crab dip though the rest of the table devoured it :) oysters and hush puppies were delic!  For dinner I had the combo platter with greens and green beans. It was a BIG plate!! The green beans were amazing and a must try. Other folks at the table had catfish and grits (delic!) crab cake platter (awesome!) gumbo (good but my least favorite on the table) and bbque shrimp ( tasty). We tasted the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding for dessert - yeah amazing! Overall service was great and food was delicious. Definitely make reservations - we came on a Tuesday night and it was packed by 7pm. A must try if you are in the area.  For 5 people + apps + dessert + two drinks our bill was $140 before tip. Pretty darn affordable ( in my humble DC over-priced opinion ;)."}
{"text":"Really had a wonderful meal here tonight. Started with a cup of  gumbo and a crab cake. They were both really tasty.  Our main dishes were blackened salmon for my wife, and jumbilaya for myself . Everything was great and tasted like authentic Cajun food. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great Cajun dinner for a fair price. Wait staff was good as well!"}
{"text":"Here's the thinking for my stars:  Based on my food, I would have given this one star, but my wife's blackened shrimp and grits earned them another star.   The price cancelled out the star i would have given for the staff.

My jambalaya was like an overcooked paste.  The flavor wasn't horrible, but i didn't think it was any better than a boxed version.

My wife did end up liking her shrimp and grits, but she didn't really like it at first and it had to grow on her.  I thought the shrimp was overdone and tough myself.  The gouda grits were surprisingly good, and I don't normally like grits.

Overall, it was very, very average.  Then the bill came.  $20 a person is too much to spend for such mediocrity... And i was actually still a little hungry."}
{"text":"3.5 Food was 4 ( shrimp was a bit flat flavored, crab cake didn't seem to have the onion, pepper, garlic trilogy of which New Orleans is famous for )  Service and Ambiance was 3"}
{"text":"Nice place.  It has great food.  But the service was a little slow.  And if you don't have a reservation, be prepared to wait.  But my party got 4 different entrees, and we loved them all."}
{"text":"The best meal i've had in I can't remember how long. The catfish and Gouda grits was off the chain! And the bananas foster bread pudding was seriously one of the best dessert I've ever eaten in my life. I ate WAY, WAY too much, and I do not regret it a bit!"}
{"text":"I tried all the dishes yelp said to order and couldn't finish anything. Everything was too salty to consume.  
I gave them two stars because the dessert on the other hand was great. I make back once just to have dessert but probably would never come back again."}
{"text":"Yay! I finally found a locally owned restaurant in Las Vegas! Lola's a great local spot where the Chef, Lola, actually owns the joint. It's a small Cajun Kitchen with a cozy family atmosphere. They have crawfish boils and the weekends and music on first fridays! Go try the shrimp and grits!"}
{"text":"I love the hospitality and the food was delish ! I recommend if your in Vegas and want some real food stop by Lola's sevice with a smile"}
{"text":"I was looking for an off-strip place to take some co-workers while we were in town for a conference.  I found Lola's and was pleased with the choice.  Louisiana is my adopted home state, and I moved away 14 years ago, so I enjoyed the Abita beer and the oysters.  My shrimp and grits had some nice spice to them and the bananas foster bread pudding was a unique twist on two classics in one!  The owner, Beth, came to our table, expedited the kitchen and even arranged our shared cab back to our hotel.  She shared the story of the visit of Guy Fiery of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, and made my choice a hit with my friends.  Best overall experience in Vegas, and I ate 3 other great places."}
{"text":"We are from Arkansas and just sayin its not like momma makes it, for a real taste of the south try Rollin Smoke BBQ, this place seemed like they use red beans and rice mix but the greens were okay. I got better greens and paid less for more at Marios market tbh. Kind of a let down. Oh and the gold and purple was hard to eat through lol."}
{"text":"Last year the food was great 4 star 
But this year ordered bronze catfish, and what was served was floating in a greasy sauce,  looked like blackened catfish . sent back
The Po Boy (soft shell crab) was very salty
New chef? 
I hope this changes it was a great little restaurant"}
{"text":"You can't find a better place to eat in Las Vegas - PERIOD. We saw this place featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives so I wanted to check it out. The Gumbo is amazing. The Red Beans & Rice was delicious and served with a bowl of cole slaw. I normally pick at cole slaw since I mostly regard it as a garnish, but at Lola's you will eat it all. The bread was so good we thought it must have been baked locally, but we were told it is flown in from New Orleans. The Catfish and Grits is incredible. I didn't know grits could taste so good. The Bananas Foster / Bread Pudding may put you into diabetic shock - but at least you won't care. The bread pudding is very dense, almost like a fruit cake and topped with a  caramelized brown sugar & buttery topping."}
{"text":"I thought I was in New Orleans. Great atmosphere and service the place was packed but yet they got us in and out quickly for lunch."}
{"text":"We showed up a half hour early, and they were already closing down for the night. However, after the waitstaff checked with the kitchen they decided to serve us during business hours. The service was good, and the beer selection rocked. My friends both ordered the jambalaya, and we were all disappointed. I've made better, and I'm not much of a cook. I ordered the catfish and grits, which was very tasty (especially the grits). I was looking forward to desert during the whole meal. We ordered three items, but were not impressed with any of them. That's how I came to three stars. I will give it another try, since there's a serious lack of mom and pop restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I'm from Louisiana and as for the flavor.....it is NOT a taste of home! My husband and I had a cup of gumbo that looked good but taste wise, it was bland and needed salt! I could taste the \"gumbo file\" and it was more like soup & over spicy!  I ordered the Craw Puppies as an appetizer, I'm not sure what tha h$ll that was!  My main dish was the Shrimp & Crawfish Étouffée and OMG..........DON'T! No other way to describe it!  There was NO flavor AT ALL and that was NOT our version of ROUX! The service was great and I loved the ice tea but overall for us true Louisiana folks, it's was a disappointment!  Sorry Lola's, y'all will NOT be seeing this Louisiana Gul again!!  

KEEPING IT !"}
{"text":"Heard about this joint while in LV and decided to stop by.  Location is hard to get to from the strip.  There was no fresh crawfish in season when I visited either.  Meals we ordered were okay but everything was missing that Nawlins bite and kick. May come again sometime."}
{"text":"The Gumbo was outstanding!! The crab cake was the best!! Red beans & rice mmmm gooood!  Small but they take reservations. Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem in Vegas.  Excellent food and friendly staff. The prices are fair and the portions are large. We will definitely be coming back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Love Lola's!!! Been there 5/6 times. Love the Shrimp and Grits, Jambalaya, and Po Boys. Decided to try something different, Shrimp Charlotte. IT IS MY NEW FAVORITE. Shrimp and mushrooms, chive, and broth over angel hair with a KICK."}
{"text":"While our experience was not the best- I would definitely come back to Lola's. Food was not hot.... Something we ordered was delivered to the table after our plates had been cleared.... But even cold Lola's tasted amazing. The staff was apologetic and made things right. That's full stars in my book!!"}
{"text":"Great food on a fantastic menu. Lola's is an off-strip/downtown gem for authentic New Orleans cuisine. The bronzed catfish is superb with the grits, and the crab cakes are well-portioned and delicious. Try the bananas foster for dessert."}
{"text":"Lola's where do I start.  Very pricey.  small portion sizes.  Stay away from the sweet potatoe pecan pie.  Lola should be ashamed to have that on her menu.  Also no cornbread muffins.
banana pudding good, red beans and rice decent.  Jambalaya if you add shrimp to your order it a additional 6 bucks and you only get 3 shrimp.  Would I go back?  No nor would I recommend to anyone else."}
{"text":"Went to Lola's with my family.  Being from New Orleans I have learned not to get my hopes up when trying a Cajun restaurant anywhere outside of NOLA.  Lola's was even more disappointing than I expected.  Overpriced and under portioned, which was just as well since everything was pretty bad.  I don't even want to describe what the roast beef sandwich looked like.  It should have gone right in the trash.  Six people at dinner, six different dishes and appetizers and no one liked any of it.  I've been to Lola's two times now... My first and last!"}
{"text":"Meals were excellent!  Softshell po boy, fried oysters, all wonderful!

Desserts were good - the bananas foster were great!

Friday night there was music on the patio - it was loud but very pleasant."}
{"text":"Every meal I have had from here is great.  Even when I am not in the mood for a big meal.  Their side dishes are plenty yummy.  I am a fan of their potato salad."}
{"text":"Always love Lola's - she offers a true southern menu with true southern taste!  We have been coming here for years.  Nothing better than her red beans and rice, grits, and of course the bread pudding with chantilly cream.  Our service has always been great - servers are laid back, friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. After visiting New Orleans and have had some authentic Cajun/Creole food, this is as good as it gets in Vegas and So. Cal. The owner flies in Leidenheimer bread weekly to make her authentic, true to form Po-Boy sandwiches. It isn't a real Po-Boy unless it's on Leidenheimer French bread. In addition, during the typical Crawfish season (March through June) she flies in these tasty things for a Friday nights ONLY Louisiana boil. It doesn't get any better. Tends to get a little too spicy, but hey, what do you expect from New Orleans?!  Other dishes are very yummy and the banana foster is perfect. Small joint, close to street traffic, but authentic Cajun/Creole food is worth tolerating these inconveniences. Staff is awesome."}
{"text":"I have to say I was disappointed. My fish was dry, and the sweet potato fries were also terribly overcooked. My girlfriend had the gumbo and it was fine, but not great. The same went for the bananas pudding."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a Cajun restaurant for several years and I think I found it in Lola's.  I went to lunch there with two friends and I was not disappointed.  We were seated right away and the wait staff was friendly and prompt.  I do not think I had a chance to put my empty drink glass down before I had a refill.  Very good service.

I started with a Po Boy Oyster Loaf and my friends had the Bronzed Catfish and the Roast Beef Debris.  None of us came away unsatisfied.  Unfortunately, we did not have time for dessert, but I will make sure to make room for it next time!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Lola's for two years and the last few times I have dined here, it has gotten progressively terrible. I am from New Orleans and I am a severe judge when it comes to Creole/Cajun cuisine. I used to recommend Lola's to people and now I feel bad. The service goes from bad to worse each time I dine here and the food has took a poop down a hole. I used to order the crab & artichoke dip and that is horrible now, I also used to get the char-grilled oysters, which were horrible the last I was there. Get it together Lola!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience from the start. I made a reservation for my husband & I, plus our baby girl & my mother. Never been here, was going to be our first time. We met my husband there & he was beyond upset. The staff at the front we're extremely rude & disrespectful to him, not greeting him & staring at him like he was crazy. They gave him attitude when he said our reservations were at 6:15, since they had it for 6:30. Who cares! No need for attitude. The people after him were welcomed with open arms, while my husband was treated poorly. I went in to speak with the \"manager\" who took no ownership of the disrespect & poor customer service. Instead mentioned how great the food was. Was not apologetic whatsoever, instead just made excuses for her & her staff.  So much for customer service & the customer always being right. We won't be back here. Hugely disappointed."}
{"text":"Was told about this place from several of my clients. Came in for lunch and was not disappointed. Had the blackended shrimp po boy and the gouda grits. Both were fantastic. The fries were excellent as well. It was a bit pricey $20 after soda and tip, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Ate here for about the 20th time last Saturday night before seeing the play at the Smith Center.  Always great food, good service, and friendly atmosphere at Lola's.  I had the shrimp etoufee, and my partner had the fried shrimp platter.  Both were excellent, the etoufee well spiced and a good hot background.  Dessert was a bananas Foster bread pudding with ice cream-- decadent, wonderful.  The owner is personable and dedicated to making your visit memorable. If you're coming here before a program at Smith Center, make your reservations early.  Most menu items require considerable prep time.  Watch for Lola's on Diners/Drive-ins and Dives on Food Channel on 06/11/12."}
{"text":"Lola's is a cute little Cajun restaurant on Charleston just east (west?) of I-15.  

I arrived at 7 on a Friday night after an aborted trip to El Sombrero (too crowded).  Fortunately, I arrived about 15-20 minutes before Lola's got slammed, so my appetizer and entree arrived promptly.

I ordered the crawpuppies and an Abita beer to start.  The crawpuppies were unusual, but very tasty.  Wish I could say the same about the Abita - marginal at best.  Oh well.

I reluctantly ordered the bronzed catfish and grits, only because they are the house specialty.  I'm not a grits fan, but the waitress convinced me I'd like the grits.  And she was right.  The grits were cooked with gouda cheese and were very tasty.  The catfish was cooked perfectly, and the accompanying sauce was wonderful.  Very complex taste, no wonder it's the house specialty.

As I mentioned earlier, they pretty much got slammed while I was at Lola's.  From my vantage point, it didn't seem like they handled it all that well.  So you may want to hit Lola's outside of prime dining hours.

The food was very good and I would go there again when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Cajun food is one of my favorites, and I've had some great meals in New Orleans and on the East Coast. Unfortunately, Lola's food was just OK. The big problem was that everything I had, except for dessert, was bland. Why would a Cajun restaurant be hesitant to season its food? I got the red beans and rice. It tasted fresh, but it was a bit too thick and had too much of a tomato flavor. What happened to the meat broth taste? They put one small slice of sausage on top of the rice and I think I detected a few tiny pieces of meat in it. The coleslaw that came with the beans was also bland although it had good ingredients in it. The crab cake also was not seasoned well and more on the soft side. I like some crisp to my crab cakes. 

Another thing that bothered me was the place was too small, so it felt as if the staff was right next to you while you were eating. They were constantly walking up and down, sometimes colliding with each other, right next to you. Usually in restaurants this is not so noticeable. I felt as if I had no privacy to eat my food since they seemed to always be walking right next to me and sometimes glancing at my table. They need to improve this because it's hard to fully relax and enjoy a meal there.

On a positive note, the service was good. My waitress was friendly and attentive. Lastly, the bread pudding, which I came there for, was delicious. It was my first time to have bread pudding so it was a great way to be introduced to it. If you get it, be sure to get the Chantilly cream with it on the side!"}
{"text":"I have to say Lola's never disappoints! I typically go to their Summerlin location which always has great service. I went to this downtown location with a group of friends and had a blast. The service was excellent! The food was delicious taste like I was In New Orleans! I got the  jambalaya which was perfectly seasoned and the sausage was amazing in it. I ordered a side of red beans and rice that was to die for! For dessert I had some classic vanilla ice cream! If your looking for a great atmosphere, food, and service go to Lola's"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! Party of four and everyone enjoyed the food. Beans and rice, catfish, oysters, crab cakes and shrimp outstanding."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for few days, we wanted to try Creole/ cajun foods from New Orleans. We found this place by reading other recommendations. The restaurant is in Downtown, about 10 min drive from South Strip. It can be tricky to locate. The restaurant welcomes its last customer by 830pm. We made our reservation for 800pm and we were almost the last customers but the place was already full. I would say that the food is OK. The dishes are very simple, no fancy thing around and on top. I would say that the price is right. Go there to enjoy a simple plate at around $16 and you do not walk out with a full belly and stomach that you can hardly walk back to your car."}
{"text":"Love it here! Shrimp and grits is my fav!! Dominic is the best server he makes it feel homie..will be going back next time I'm in Vegas for sure! And I'll make sure to check the new location out!"}
{"text":"hit lola's last night with gf and sis. 

this is the 3rd restaurant at this spot ( i ate at one of the others - the name escapes me ) in the last two years or so. 

decent job in remodeling the place - simple, yet comfortable. 

sis had cup of gumbo, crab cake dinner; gf had bronze catfish with grits; i tried the gumbo and jambalaya. 

they provide a sorry ass basket of stale bread ( maybe it's meant to soak in the gumbo - who knows ? ) 

gumbo ( $4.25 ) - cup - alot of shredded chicken, small shrimp , some andouille sausage bits a lil bit of okra - decent taste. personally, i prefer a darker roux /base - provides a little nuttier, richer taste but still, not bad. 

the crab cake dinner - 2 nice sized crab cakes on a bed of greens - nice portion of crab in the cake - good flavor. the greens ok to but it had the look of an appetizer - asked the server if it's the appetizer , \" no the appetizer is one crab cake ) - $15 - a little pricey - but still good. 

the jambalaya ( $10 ) - very good, spiced just right, good mix of sausage and chicken ( did not go with the shrimp option - $13 ) - the andouille sausage slices on top tasted like smoked polish sausage , possibly farmer john brand - ok by me. 

the winner was the catfish / grits. the description mentioned a mushroom ragu - but it should be mushroom surprise as in try and find the mushroom ! still, great cheesy grits, tender flaky catfish browned, not blackened. sorry, i forget the price but pretty sure under $15. 

we shared the bananas foster - very good - wanted to try the bread pudding but i ain't up for the raisins ! 

overall, service pleasant. Had a nice chat with the manager ( or was it the owner ) - giving my 2 cents and more importantly, well wishes that they succeed - 

SHOW SOME LOCAL LOVE PEOPLE !

{"text":"Stopped in last night to try this place out, was hoping to satisfy my creole itch since I won't be getting back to NOLA anytime soon. The food was pretty good overall and they had a nice selection of Abita beers. I had the crawpuppies, which were a little on the small side but tasty, kinda like a spicy fried mini crab cake, and the shrimp and grits, which were damned good. Washed it all down with a couple Purple Haze's and thought about dessert but was to full. Overall a good spot for some decent creole faire, I would love to come back and try some of the other menu offerings next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Lolas is located in the artsy complex that once housed the Holsum Bread bakery.  We met for dinner on a Friday night, and the place was full when we arrived at 6:45.  Friend had catfish and grits, I had jambalaya.  We were both very happy with our meals.  By 7;45 or so several tables had opened up.  We saw couples, families with kids, hipsters, and it looked to me like a locals spot.  Prices were reasonable in my view - we got out of there - food and beverages for about $25 each."}
{"text":"Giving this place a tried, good Louisiana style restaurant good atmosphere sit outside if you have a chance  it get pretty busy at lunch time.
Great place to go after doing some shopping across the street."}
{"text":"Awesome food great service. The barbeque shrimp was flavorful and spicy. The shrimp and grits was outstanding. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great gumbo.
Jambalaya tasted reheated with meat tossed in. My only complain with food.
Music loud and intrusive classic rock stuff. Hard to hear conversation.
Small and kinda tight for seating when the patio is not open.
Over all I strongly recommend this place. Good stuff and been on the food network if that is your gimmick."}
{"text":"If you want great New Orleans Style food at a great price off the Vegas Strip, this is a must. The place is near Fremont in quaint Bourbon St. like place playing Zydeco music. The Cajun cuisine is probably better than even Bourbon St. in New Orleans! The Gumbo appetizer was almost a meal with generous portions of shrimp. The Red Beans and Rice was huge and had plenty of sausage.  Staff were excellent and very friendly. I will definitely include this in my next visit."}
{"text":"Love me some Lolas. Great food great location and reasonably priced . But unfortunately today the host Samantha was having a bad day . My sweetheart and myself decided to order take out from Lolas, one poboy sandwich . My baby was at work and got held just a bit but enough to change our plans and just stay and eat there, well thats when Sam got a little perplexed about the whole thing and just got rude to the point that i had to ask if we can just sit down because she was not helping us at all or making us feel welcome to stay . Sat down got some tea my baby had given sam a 20 to pay for the bill ,Sam never offer up any change back at all (i guess she was feeling that it hers for putting up with us ) i dont care if just pennies left over you always bring back the change. But regardless of what happened we will still come back for the crabcakes ,the catfish is wicked awesome and the rest of the crew have always been courteous and always happy to see us. Sam you DO NOT belong as a hostess if you can't restraint your negative attitude while dealing with the public remember , \"there's nothing to fear from outside competition than from inside inefficiency, apathy or bad service\" 
Thank you"}
{"text":"Last year went to Lola's and had bronzed catfish wit cheesy grits. I licked the plate clean! This year, same dish---catfish was not bronzed. It was blackened and not the 2 fillets like year. Could not even get to the grits due to the grease slick- about 1/4\" thick. So sad!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch or maybe early dinner there. 2:30 and still busy.  Ordered the roast beef hoagy.  Lots of beef and good sauce.

My wife had their gumbo  It was Fantastic. The main was shrimp and grits. The grits were like creamy mashed potatoes and the grilled shrimp were marinated in a great sauce and grilled.  we'll be back for that again.

Really nice for them to have a gluten free menu.

5 star service."}
{"text":"We had crab cake, craw fish puppies, grilled oyster and bronzed cat fish w grits and banana frosted bread pudding. 

Everything was good to excellent. 

Crab cake was filled with lots of crab meat and nice size. Vey good flavor. 

The puppies was very nice and has lots of spice. I loved it. Nice kick of spiciness

The catfish was fresh and cooked just right. The grit was very good. The Sauce had nice spiciness. I would come back for this dish. 

The dessert was good but I wasn't impressed. 

Our waitress was tentative and very nice."}
{"text":"Wow, what a find!  My coworker spotted this place on Yelp and convinced a few of us to go.

My cab driver had some trouble finding the place, until he noticed it was right next to the bread factory:  \"Ohhh well you didn't tell me it was next to the bread factory!  If you had said it was right next to the bread factory, i would have known exactly where it was. Next time you should mention that it's next to the bread factory.\"  Note to self: next time, tell the cab driver it's next to the bread factory.

The meal was absolutely delicious and about half the price of a much crappier meal on the strip.  Gumbo - delicious.  Blackened catfish with grits - unbelievably delicious.  Bananas foster dessert - delicious.

The waiter was super-friendly and Lola herself came out from the kitchen to say goodbye when we left!

This place is truly a diamond in the rough.  I mean that literally -- I think we passed 5 different bail bonds companies and LIVE NUDE GIRLS clubs on the way to the restaurant from the main strip. In any case, I'm not kidding when I say that I plan to visit this restaurant every time I visit Las Vegas from now on.

Thanks Lola for giving me something to look forward to on my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Was waiting to meet Rick of American Restoration and was looking for some where to kill some time.  So we stopped in since it was near by and was pleasantly surprised. 

We had the crab dip, catfish, and shrimp & grits. All 3 were very good the only complaint I had was that the shrimp and grits was pretty small for the price. 

Overall was very good."}
{"text":"I just paid a visit to the town center location on 10/25 at 1:30pm for lunch as my office is less then a mile away. It has been about a month since my last visit. The food here is really good except this time I did not wait around. After sitting at the bar area where there were only 2 people  and only one eating I saw that one of the employees was watching TV. I sat there for approximately 7 to 10 minutes with no one coming over with a menu or asking if I wanted a drink. I left and went somewhere else. Hopefully management will read this. It might explain why there were only 2 people in the place."}
{"text":"I've never had authentic Cajun/Creole food and have always wanted to try.. this place really set a high standard for me! It's a cozy little spot just off the I-15 neighboring the North Premium Outlets. It's a small place, so claustrophobic people beware! But the food definitely makes up for the lack of space.

Appetizers:

Crab Cakes (5/5): Very moist and perfect consistency. A little crunch on the outside from the pan fry, but not dry at all. The lemon and garlic aioli was thick and perfect not to overpower the taste of the crab cake.

CrawPuppies (5/5): GAME CHANGER! Not usually one to reach for hush puppies or crawfish, but wow.. they were very flavorful! The true test was splitting it in half and seeing the steam rise from the inside.. lets just say it passed with flying colors! Served with Cajun aioli that gives it that little kick of heat.

Hot Wings & Fries (4/5): Nothing too out of the ordinary. Love the French fries, you can definitely tell they're fresh in house.. not the frozen bagged crap. 

Side Caesar Salad (4/5): Gave an extra point because of the portion size. For a \"side\" salad it's HUGE! Flavors were the usual, nothing that knocked my socks off.

Gumbo (5/5) : Super hearty and filling! Packed with flavor and just the right amount of heat. Rice was also cooked to a good consistency where it's not mushy like jasmine or too hard that you got to chomp chomp. Good for those who do not like a lot of heat in their food.

Jambalaya (5/5):  Spicy and delicious. Generous amount of protein to rice, they did NOT skimp out. If you're sensitive to spicy foods, it might not be the dish for you. Otherwise, the plate was completely empty.

Shrimp Creole (5/5): VERY GENEROUS portion of shrimp. Loved the tomato based sauce and just the right amount of spice. You will LOVE this dish if you are in the mood for something spicy, but not over the top

Fried Catfish Platter (5/5): Heaping amount of catfish. I want to say 2 decent sized fillets! The remoulade was light and tangy enough that it didn't over power the fish, not like it needed more flavor anyways. Breading was crispy and perfectly seasoned. Came with house fries, which were also good. Trust.. this is better than other catfish platters, must better portion.

The food was BOMB. The service was great! Also looking that the menu, they have a little something for everyone. Don't be afraid to try it out!"}
{"text":"NOTE: Consider this a 3.5-star review. I just didn't have the option on Yelp.

Overall, a fine meal with a couple of small hiccups. The waitress did her part, keeping a close eye on the table before my wife arrives, bringing drinks, offering appetizers, the whole nine. We sat outside and enjoyed the rare perfect Vegas weather, one of two tables out there for a late lunch. That's only important because I think the kitchen took way too long under the circumstances.

We both ordered po' boys - me the roast beef debris ($9) and she the blackened catfish ($11.) For a couple of simple sandwiches, the kitchen was really slow. I felt bad for the waitress, who kept looking at us and going back to the kitchen over and over. It was at least 20 minutes with only one other table ordering in front of us.

The bread was the star of mine, fresh and with a good spread on it that added a lot of flavor. The beef was fine - nothing special, a touch dry but still enjoyable. I'd thought about getting the fried oyster po' boy and I think I'd go that way next time. The catfish was spot on, blackened with a little spice, no fishy taste at all. My sweet potato fries were solid, her regular fries were excellent, clearly fresh cut and not too greasy.

Check came to $24 with tip, which I think is a little pricey for a couple of sandwiches. That's the half-star I yanked from what would have been four stars otherwise. On the whole, good enough to get me back in for a second try."}
{"text":"LATE REVIEW:
My visit here was back in November 2015 around Thanksgiving. My family and I were looking to try something new. 

When my Mom chose this place it looked quite sketchy to me because of the dark windows and small location. But as soon as I walked in you felt the Louisiana vibes. 

The staff was very welcoming and extra accommodating to our needs. 

The food was AMAZING!!! We started ourselves off with Cajun hot wings and fries along with some gumbo. 

My mom had: Bronzed Catfish and Grits
I was able to have a taste of it and let me tell you..... I hate grits but this was delicious! The grits and the catfish complemented each other well.

My dad had: Fries Chicken Salad

My Fiancé had: Blackened Salmon

I had the fried Chicken Breast and my goodness it is by far the best Fried Chicken I ever had. No grease! Thick, crispy, and crunchy skin! And the meat was so juicy and flavorful. 

We finished everything off with their Banana Foster and that too was delicious

I would definitely return on my next visit especially at the fact that we had wonderful customer service. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of our server but she was so sweet. All that I could remember was that she was young, Caucasian and pretty."}
{"text":"This review is based on my second experience at Lola's. 
My husband and I walked in and it was completely empty besides a could of people eating outside. We were seated and the waitress asked us what we wanted to drink. However, a worker walked up to her and told her here was an issue he needed to show her. She just walked away. Didn't say I will be right back or got our drinks first, nothing. 

The place started to fill up and other people started to get serviced by other waitresses before us. We were annoyed. So, the waitress servicing the other tables asked us for our drink and apologized for the other waitress. The first waitress comes back. She never gave us her name and just re asked for our drinks. 

We ordered our food We both got po boys. I asked for sweet potato fries but got regular fries. The second waitress which actually did her job well brought out our food. The first waitress that was waiting our table just asked if we needed anything and never came back. We never got a refill we never were asked if things were good or not. 

The food was decent not the best but I wouldn't return because of the horrible service. I tip well but for that kind of service you can have a penny. She sucked at her job and I wish the second waitress had been our waitress. 

The service sucks."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday, and it was a great choice. There aren't many true Louisiana-style restaurants in Las Vegas, but this one sure fits the bill.

Friends had recommended that we make a reservation, and we're glad we did. We asked for a table along the wall, which we got. Otherwise, we might have been stuck in the middle, which is a long row of closely placed single tables that almost looks like community seating. We've heard Lola's was super loud, but it was fine for us --  maybe because it was Thursday night, or maybe we just got lucky.

We started off splitting a crab cake and six char-broiled oysters. These were both so good that I wish we would have doubled the order. For his entree, my husband ordered the Shrimp Charlotte, which was marked on the menu as one of \"Lola's favorites.\" Although the shrimp was fine, my husband wasn't too impressed with the angel hair pasta. I was really pleased with my entree, the bronzed catfish and grits. The fish was served in small pieces atop cheesy gouda grits and bits of andouille sausage. This dish was spicy but delicious, and I would definitely order it again! 

Since it was a special occasion, we ordered the bananas foster bread pudding to split, and although I am not a picky eater, I actually sent it back. From the menu description, I was expecting bread pudding with sliced bananas on top, but the bananas were mixed into the bread pudding and were pretty indiscernible. The waitress graciously swapped this out with the traditional bread pudding, which was much better. But I think they missed the boat on my original order. Maybe next time I'll order the bananas foster and pour them over the bread pudding myself! (Or maybe they should add this to the menu as an option. I bet it would be a hit.)

A good selection of Abita beers and great service made up for the small shortcomings on the menu, and we'll definitely be back so my husband can try another entree selection. I think I'll stick with the bronzed catfish and grits."}
{"text":"Fantastic! A MUST visit when in Vegas. They have two locations now but I've only been to the one downtown. The food is excellent and the staff is friendly. Parking is a little exciting but worth the hassle once you taste the food."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!  I am usually not a huge cajun food lover but everything that we tried was flavorful and delish!  The crab cakes were delish and the crabs were nicely sized!  I ordered the New Orlean's style BBQ shrimp and it was yummy!  It was perfectly seasoned!  Portion was perfect for me...but I am a tiny person.  And their dessert was devlishly delish!  I am not a bread pudding person but the banana foster bread pudding is something to try.  Next time, I am going to work backwards and start with dessert as it is large.  There was four of us and we were not able to finish the dessert with all us.

I would definitely go back again!  And I would reccommend that you make a reservation to get a table"}
{"text":"We have eaten here quite a few times, every time its great. I always feel like im back in new orleans, great comfortable atmosphere. I also appreciate the availability of both crystal and louisiana brand hot sauces, for the purists. Order anything, you wont be disappointed. The poboys are perfect, sweet potato fries are yummy, shrimp and grits is legit, jambalaya is as authentic as any I have ever had, crawpuppies are a must try. If you come on a friday or saturday do yourself a favor and make a reservation. Dont forget to save room for bread pudding, the bananas fosters bread pudding is ridiculous!

Pro tip: the crawpuppies come with a yummy cajun mayo, save it for dipping your fries if you happen to order a poboy!"}
{"text":"Very cute little place. The food was amazing. Yes a bit pricey but I don't mind paying a little more when the food is yummy. My husband and I shared the soft shell crab as an appetizer. Fabulous ! He had the browned shrimp (think that's what it was called) and I had shrimp creole. Both were delicious. Seasoning was spot on perfect. Was too full for dessert so we took bread pudding to go. Our waitress made us cafe au lait even though it was not on the menu. A perfect cup of coffee. Will definitely go back again !!"}
{"text":"Went from Tanya Creek Brewery to this place on their recommendation since they did not have food. Some of the best Louisiana style food I have had. Lots of choices. You will not be disappointed. Good service an reasonable prices. I will be back."}
{"text":"If you know REAL Cajun/Creole food you will be very disappointed! But the service was even worse. After being told that there are no seats and passing by several empty tables outside, I was already turned off. After sitting in front of everyone at the bar and being ignored by staff members, I was ready to go! When I was finally helped, the waitress didn't ask if I wanted a drink, but she asked the older white women next to me if she wanted something. She also never gave me napkins but took some over to the lady next to me. I figured the food would make up for the horrible service, but it DIDNT! Never again,"}
{"text":"I use an app called TV Food Maps and keep finding gems like Lola's.  I always want to go to the places where the food network goes, and Lola's was on Triple D.  We were not disappointed! Great authentic NOLA food! Hubby had gumbo, blackened catfish and grits, and I had the blackened catfish po boy sandwich. Everything was packed with flavor and so good! But, there were two standouts in our meal.... The crab and artichoke appetizer is like cheesy heaven crack.....and the bananas foster bread pudding is a crunchy, sugary, awesome ice creamy bread dream.  We stuffed ourselves silly, and happily so!"}
{"text":"WOW!! What a treat. In town for a conference for the week and this is the best meal I've had. Our waitress Angela was fantastic!! 

Take my advise and treat yourself to a great meal!"}
{"text":"I give it three stars not because my dish wasn't good in fact it was great, but the other dishes were sub par.

First-make a reservation it's very small which is fine, but the waits could be long which can also be annoying if you are on any time crunch.

Second-it's very small so if you don't mind sitting outside I would suggest sitting out there.

Third-if you have been To Louisiana and have had traditional regional cuisine than take this place as a solid attempt.

The food- we started with red beans and rice, it was very, very bland.  We had to add a pot of salt and hot sauce to even mimic any sort of flavor.

My wife ordered the fried shrimp PO Boy, the batter on the shrimp was ironically so salty neither of us could eat it.

I ordered the shrimp and grits, it was amazing, grits were perfect, tons of flavor in the shrimp, and sauce that came on the edge was amazing.  We both agreed it was definitely worth coming there for the shrimp and grits.

All in all it's a cool place off the strip to sit and hangout the service was great and the small atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"Overall, good food, ok service, slightly overpriced and very loud! My husband and I went about 8pm on a Wednesday evening after a Smith Center event. The indoor and outdoor seating areas are both very small. The staff was not rude but not overly friendly either. My husband pointed out that it was almost closing time and they were probably tired but honestly they could be a lot more friendly and welcoming. Both of us love Cajun food so were excited to try the dishes. My husband had the gumbo and liked it. It was well spiced, traditional and served with rice. I had the shrimp and grits. You get five large shrimp, cooked well on a bed of grits with a sauce of sausage and mushrooms.  The gouda grits had great flavor but I was not a fan of the texture. I'm from the south and this is my favorite dish. These grits had the consistency of mashed potatoes and were almost gummy. Again, the flavor was very good I just did not like the thick heaviness of the grits. The grilled garlic bread was also just ok. Very little flavor and inconsistent preparation, some was barely warmed, others had char marks. Our waiter was generally attentive but again not very friendly. He also didn't recommend or offer suggestions for anything. The price wasn't bad but honestly have had similar quality for half the price. Due to the size of the restaurant it was also incredibly loud. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Between the I-15 freeway and the railroad tracks on Charlestown boulevard away from it all, there's a little tiny place called Lola's were big things are happening.
 I've had for so long skipped this place for being located in a not so attractive industrial area of Las Vegas not knowing what I was missing. But after picking up a friend from UMC after all his cancer tests came back negative we decided to go and celebrate, after a quick search on yelp we ended up at Lola's.
 Of green color walls decorated with Mardi gras and the saints memorabilia, a little bar and only a handful of tables the small dining room makes you feel like you had actually traveled to a different state. the Jazz music on the background and the smell of Cajun dishes from other patrons around you only confirms it. At Lola's not only they bring you the food they serve in Luisiana, they also take you there. But if leaving vegas is not your thing, they also have some patio seating with a view of down town and the Las Vegas premium outlet mall. Either way you can't go wrong, you'll be enjoying some of the best comfort dishes this side of the strip.
Service was decent, not stellar but only what was required, our waitress was busy so we didn't expected too much, got our food and beers and we were happy.
We started with the crab cakes and they were not the best, sad to inform, they were a little too mushy and not crab flaky but passable and tasty non the less. Vindication came when my bronzed shrimp & grits and the shrimp Charlotte arrived and we realized we had made the right choice. We ordered those because they were two of the most popular dishes at Lola's but I can't wait to try other items that also sounded delicious, and if the crab cakes are worst thing they offer and the shrimp & grits the best, anything in the middle is going to be fabuloso.
 Go by car or go by train...but get to Lola's now."}
{"text":"Yes we went because we saw Lola's on Triple D. Was it good? You bet. We went for lunch - my wife had the blackened shrimp po boy; I had the soft shell crab po boy. She was not over the top with the shrimp but I love soft shell crab and this was perfect, not greasy and tasty.

The service was attentive and friendly even though the place was packed. Lucky for us we got there about 10 minutes before the rush. Prices aren't cheap but they weren't too bad.

We had the sweet potato pie and it was delicious. I took home a piece of bread pudding and it was over the top, one of the best bread puddings I have ever had.

My wife and I agree we'll be back, probably for dinner sometime. It's so nice to find a great, single owner restaurant in Vegas, the mecca of chains. Thank's to Guy F for turning the world on to Lola's."}
{"text":"Small space, simple Mardi Gras decor, good service, good food.  Not sure what you'd like?  Get a Royal Trio, it's a cup of Jumbalaya, Crawfish Etouffee, & red beans & rice.  A good sampler to get a taste of several things.  The garlic bread served at the table is light, fresh, & delicious.  It's from the bakery next door. My favorite of the three was the Crawford Etoufffee."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I saw this little gem on a TV show (I can't remember which one) and added it to my list of \"must try's\".  Lola's did not disappoint!

I had the crab cake, shrimp creole, and bananas foster bread pudding.  The crab cake was very tasty, and the shrimp creole was as flavorful and authentic.  It reminded me of eating in New Orleans.  Yum! They do a remarkable job -- excellent flavors! 

My friend had the shrimp and grits.  I'm not a huge grits fan, but these were good.  Whatever they did to the shrimp with her dish must have been straight from heaven.  Spicy and delicious!

and... the bananas foster bread pudding... that should be the picture next to the word \"dessert\" in the dictionary.  A sweet, tasty bowl of perfection.

Good thing Vegas is only a 4 hour drive from home... I'll definitely be back to Lola's!"}
{"text":"Dined here last night for my fathers birthday.  Delicious food, fast and friendly service.  Even though they don't have a children's menu they do have items they make for children.  They do take reservations on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Great food, its a way off the strip but definitely worth the trip. The gumbo was as good or better than any we had in New Orleans. The crab cakes were the best I've had. The jambalaya and red beans and rice were both outstanding,  even though my red beans are as good."}
{"text":"This was a small, quaint establishment, but we were seated right away because we had made reservations. They had a great selections of Louisiana craft beers at a great price. For starters we had the charbroiled oysters and crab cake. The oysters were Cooked in garlic butter with lemon and Parmesan cheese. They were great with a nice piece of crusty bread. The crab cake was good, not fantastic, but tasty nonetheless. Our group had the jambalaya and the bronzed shrimp and grits. Jambalaya portion was huge and it was nice and spicy! The shrimp were fantastic, plump, flavorful, and spicy. The grits were creamy, and the Gouda cheese was a great addition. Wish we would have had the room for dessert! I' d go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for New Orleans style food ever since I left New Orleans and Lolas here in Las Vegas is the closest thing I found to being in the New Orleans.  My husband had the softshell crab poboy, and he said it was just as delicious as the ones he had in New Orleans.  I had the shrimp Creole with the rice and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent. Everything about this place. The vibe was very cozy upon walking it. It's small and quaint, a family restaurant atmosphere. 

The fried chicken and the house hot sauce was out of this f*cking world. So good I had to curse. I never take home doggy bags but I did with this one.

Banana foster dessert was very tasty. Fresh quality.


This place just has it going on. I highly recommend them if it's a first date or if you want to go somewhere small where you can actually hear your conversation while eating yummy food. 

A win!"}
{"text":"Easily the most enjoying meal I had while in LV for 4 days.  If you are the type like me who disdains chain restaurants, including the much hyped celebrity chef ones, then give this off-the Strip place a try.  The bowl of jambalaya and crab cake salad were fresh and delicious.  Place was jammed pack already at 11:30am with mostly locals, so come get some."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite parts of Vegas now!  I'm not huge fan of Vegas in general but I get excited only knowing that I get to eat here again. I've been 5 times now all during different Vegas trips and each time get to bring someone new to share the experience and flavors.

My favorite is the jambalaya w/shrimp of course. That shrimp is freakin amazing. The overall flavor is spot on with the rest of the spices and ingredients. I've also had the gumbo and shrimp n grits. All are amazing, no lie. 

Another plus is the amazing service we've recieved each time we've gone. Amazingly helpful and honest, thanks for that. 

Feels like one of those travel channel hole-in-the-wall restraunts that food critics would love. Can't recommend this place to enough new people. Will be back soon I'm sure and can't wait!"}
{"text":"It's not 100% as good as real NOLA cuisine, but it's almost there! Get off strip and enjoy some delicious home cooked food!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service! The place is rather small but cozy with deco from New Orleans. The parking is an adventure to find. The lot around back is large but would be a little daunting at night. The remains of buildings of years gone by make it a rough road to traverse. We went during daylight hours. There is also a parking lot on the east side of the building. Good luck finding it on your first visit. 

Walking across the back lot and into the building is a challange the first time as there are no signs to guide you. But...we found it...right through the back door along a hall and into Lola's beverage service area. We heard the crowd and zidego (sp) music knowing this was the place.  

The lunch crowd was large and loud....a lot of fun and Lola was wandering around the dining room making sure that patrons were being taken care of and assisting the waite staff when needed. Appeared to be a very hands on owner. 

The food was amazing. My wife and I had Po'Boys. She had the oyster 'loaf' and I tried the Roast Beef Debris. Both sandwiches were very good, hot and fresh. The oysters were huge and mine was like having a pot roast on a roll. The sides were french fries (could've had a little more crunch) and cole slaw which was nice and fresh. We observed other dishes being served. It's not hard to gawk is a small room. The shrimp Etoufee' looked very good as did the catfish plate, gumbo and crawpuppies. 

To finish up our experience our waitress recommended the 'Lola's Famous Bread Pudding'. OMG is all I can say. It was warm and covered with  Jim Beam praline sauce and toppped with whipped cream. Yum.

We will definitly go back and the next time we'll know where the back door is and not get sorta lost. The front of the place faces east Charleston and looks nice when you drive by ON Charleston. But you can't get there from there. Use Mapquest."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I traveled here while in my sorority convention and this place was by far the best place that we are while in Vegas.  It's a small little gem. We made reservations for 9 people and they were ready when we arrived. All of the food was amazing and we ordered just about everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Great service, great food (we had shrimp creole, shrimp po boy, and blackened catfish and grits) as well as dessert (bananas foster, sweet potato pecan pie, and the fig thing). Everything was so so good! Would definitely come back on any visit to LV. And maybe come back to LV just for Lola's!!!"}
{"text":"Shrimp Charlotte and the Catfish and Grits is absolutely delicious!!!! Very fresh.. I most definitely be back to visit!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here on Wednesday. They get very crowded and seating is limited. The service was fast and friendly. The shrimp and grits were 5 stars. I had the grilled oysters and they were okay. They were rather small for the price and got a little dried out. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is on the top of my list of favorites!!  The food is outstanding!  We had the jambalaya, soft shell crab poboy and shrimp with Gouda grits, sausage with mushroom ragout. Lola's has an intimate feel and the service is impeccable. Lola's is Las Vegas's little hot spot!!  Try it! You won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"We got the tip to go here from the restaurant owner of the place visited last night in Panguitch, UT. As it was on our way we tried it out and weren't disappointed: I'm intolerant to wheat and they had plenty of gluten free options. My wife doesn't tolerate spicy too well and still plenty of options. All was very tasty and unique outside of Louisiana, served with a smile from one of the many friendly waitresses and in a great atmosphere of a small restaurant. You can see, feel and taste that the personnel works here with pleasure!"}
{"text":"I am a road warrior.  I am used to eating alone, but I never get used to be treated poorly because I am eating alone.  I was really looking forward to eating here, but they would only seat me at a tiny 2 seat table with a total stranger...how awkward that would be.  They had 2 tables open, but they were being kept for party's of 2.  So, I walked."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a great environment. They keep the fresh bread coming, which is another plus. Definitely recommend the crab cake as an appetizer and the shrimp and grits for an entree. The bread pudding desserts are something you definitely can't go wrong with. Wonderful place!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! They seated us right away for a table of two on Saturday night with no reservations. 
We had to start with the Craw-Puppies. They were a little smaller then you would expect but they were super yummy! They come with a delicious aioli to dip. They also have really good starter bread. 
My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp Po'Boy - so good! I had the Catfish and Grits. The catfish had a spicy kick to it! I ended up liking his a little better then mine, but not by much. Both the dishes were blast of creole flavors. 
Absolutely delicious! Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"This place is a jewel! I come here whenever we come to Vegas. The bronze cat fish is a must try."}
{"text":"Wow this was a first. A bug  crawled out of my girlfriends salad. A good sized leaf looking bug, big enough to immediately catch your attention when crawling on your plate! That was shocking and disgusting. The waitress is very nice and took her meal off the bill. Very shocking. Not coming back ever. The picture is of her replacement crab cake with no salad."}
{"text":"It really pays to get off the Strip!

My wife & I boarded the Gold Line bus for the ride into what's called the Arts District of Vegas. The walk from the bus stop to Lola's at night seemed a bit scary but, in the end, wasn't that far. Boy, was Lola's worth the walk.

We started with the flame-broiled oysters and fresh sweet bread. What a combo. I could have eaten a dozen but we kept it to a half dozen so we had room for e rest of e meal.

For my entree, I enjoyed the Trout Meniere Almondine - fried fish at it's finest, moist and perfectly cooked. My wife loved the Ebony Catfish over grits with a yummy sauce studded with Andouille sausage.

Save room for dessert because they are all made in-house. We shared a huge portion of Bananas Foster with ice cream. The bananas were perfectly caramelized.

Take a break from the  madness called The Strip. Do yourself a favor and check out Lolas.

BTW,  there IS a Lola. She came out of the kitchen to introduce herself. What a sweet person, as are the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place! I love Louisiana style food. Honestly the only thing that stopped me was the location. But made a reservation for a Saturday night girls dinner and the restaurant didn't disappoint! Everything we tried was incredible. We ordered the crab cakes which had lumps of crab in it, the crawfish étouffée.. YUM! The grits, the shrimp creole both fantastic! Definitely had a lot of flavor and we will be back to try more on their menu. I will be recommending this restaurant! Only reason I gave it four stars was because our server kept disappearing!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of wines and beers to go with traditional New Orleans food. I had shrimp and grits and it was delicious, shrimp were large and cooked perfectly and in a rich (though a little salty for my taste) with assuage onions and mushrooms over some rich Gouda grits $16.99. Husband orders Jambalaya with chicken and sausage and paid $4 up charge to add shrimp and it was Very Good. Bread toasted on the grill comes with your meal and there are several appetizers and we saw many of them go by our table but peptide not to have any. All of the portions seems to be plenty to fill most any appetites. Our server and then manager as well as the other staff seemed to be genuine and helpful as well as friendly. 
It's a very all place only 45 seats so make a reservation.  It's a little loud because it's so small, and plays great Louisiana music!Also I went through 3 taxi drivers that did not know where it was so I let the last taxi driver use my GPS! Manager says they are moving in the spring to a place a little closer to main street downtown and also opening a location in Sumerland  NV (sp)
It was worth the trouble getting there, Enjoy"}
{"text":"We had a craving for cajun and found this place via Yelp!  So we decided to make the 30-minute drive and check out the hype.

Friendly staff!  Food was delicious!!  Price could have been a little bit better!

Between my wife, daughter, & I, the bill ended up being approximately $50 (inclusive of tip) for a late afternoon lunch.  I had the po' boy oysters w/sweet potato fries.  The wife ordered the oyster platter and small cup of gumbo, while my teen daughter settled for the chicken strips w/fries.  The oysters dishes were great and they are a must order, in my opinion.  The sides were all prepared well and complimented the meals perfectly.

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the price.  I think everything we ordered was worth the price tag except for the gumbo and chicken strips.  $5 for a small cup of gumbo and $10 for some chicken strips was, in my opinion again, a bit too much.  Everything else was reasonable for the portion sizes and tasty-ness experienced.

BOTTOM LINE - We'll be back for seconds; however, this can't be a regular place for us due to the cost."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place, countless times that Ive been in Vegas, and only recently had the chance to experience it. Before I go in on this place I gotta say I'm a fan of Cajun food and lived in New Orleans for a while, so I'm hard to please.
Negatives

1. this place only has a beer and wine bar. There's something wrong when I can't get a hurricane with my crab cakes!
2. it closes at 10pm in a city that never sleeps. 
3. Food was nothing to rave about.
4. For sure, pass on hot wings

In fairness, I want to expand on 3. We had the crab cakes, hot wings, jambalaya, catfish Po Boy, and red beans and rice. Everything was very fresh, so that's a plus. There was a hint of what I remember to be Cajun food but overall, it tasted like something i would expect at a chain restaurant. 

The bright light in this place is certainly the staff. They all acted like they loved their jobs and more importantly the restaurant and it showed. I probably won't come back, but if you've never been to Louisiana or had authentic home-cooked cajun, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We've tried every place Guy Fieri has recommended in Vegas, and as far as we're concerned, he's 3/4.  The only place he got wrong was Lotus of Siam (It sucks).  This place is great.  The food is wonderful and the service is quick and attentive.  I had the Bronzed Shrimp and Grits, and my wife had the shrimp platter with the shrimp blackened.  We also had the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding for dessert.  The only criticism was Jamie said her shrimp were too salty.  I could have eaten two bowls of the grits.  It's inspired me to try to make it myself.  I don't think I'll be able to do it, but I'll give it a go."}
{"text":"Lola's is the Real Deal. It ain't fancy, in fact we sat on plastic lawn chairs, but the Cajun food is some of the best you will ever eat outside your Mom's or your wife's kitchen (assuming you married a Cajun). This place is GREAT. The food was so good we ate there twice on a four-day trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"The waitress took her time and helped us select dishes.  The food was excellent, better than most of the stuff on the strip, and very affordable.  One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"It's my second time and so far it hasn't failed me yet !!! Best thing next to my granny"}
{"text":"Really good food! Fast service! I had a shrimp plate that was amazing ! And my bf got chicken Alfredo with black chicken was great also. itotally recommended"}
{"text":"Lola and her team have created a fun comfortable and delish place to hang out and enjoy a quality tasting meal Cajun authentic foods. It was suggested to me by our server Heather that i needed to try the grits and shrimp ~ Fantastic choice. Brought family their as a group of 7 and yes the spacing was tight, but definitely manageable and fun. 7 different dishes were ordered and all of them received excellent reviews from my group. Staff has always been accommodating and nice every time i go...i keep going back.

It is a must for locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and cozy, but the food is oh so delicious! Service is friendly and fast! Ordered the shrimp po boy and the shrimp was cooked perfectly with so much shrimp. Definitely made fresh to order rather than sit under a heat lamp! Will definitely hit this spot up again when I'm in the area. 

If you're planning on a \"get-to-know-someone\" date here, it's really loud. It might just work for you though, if you're into it. Your date will love the food though, promise."}
{"text":"Lola's is pretty good, but I don't think it will blow your mind if you've been to real Cajun restaurants in New Orleans, like Deanie's.  But it is pretty remarkable -- albeit not quite the same as you would expect in NOLA.

It wasn't crawfish season when I went, so I wasn't able to get crawfish.  I actually went twice.  Once I got a shrimp po-boy and a cup of gumbo, and the other time I got crawfish ettouffe.  

The po-boy and gumbo were excellent.  The gumbo was the best thing I had here.  The ettouffe was not really very good at all.  It had the texture of lumpy gravy, which is not normal for ettouffe.

I was in town for work, so I didn't have to pay for it myself, but if I had I would have been upset that it is kind of pricy and they charge you for every little extra.  For example, I got charged a few dollars for an extra cup of rice for my ettouffe when all it came with a little bit.

I would go back to Lola's, but it's not a priority for me in Las Vegas.  I have been back to town and not stopped by, trying other local restaurants instead.

It's good -- but not great -- kind of pricy, won't blow your mind, but is worth trying once or twice to see what you think."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to avoid. I am sure that once upon a time it was probably worth a visit but those days are clearly long past. The cutlery/silverware was dirty... All of our utensils at the table had dried bits of food on them. We had to ask for them to be exchanged. The food might have been approaching palatable if it had been at least almost warm. It is no wonder that the food was cold because the dishes felt as though they had just come out of a refrigerator. The portions were so small that a canary would have starved. The rice with the gumbo was not even fully cooked. And the bananas Foster we're not even close to being legitimate or authentic. They were merely cold, sliced bananas dumped on a plate with old, cold sauce of some sort...Not even an attempt at the real deal. When we complained about the desert to a blonde haired woman who claimed to be the manager, She did not get us a properly prepared dessert but instead cleared away their failed attempt and charged us 50% of the advertised price because we had taken a couple bites sampling it. I suggest that next time people go to a place like McDonald's where at least whatever they serve is warm."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had the same experience both times.  Nothing spectacular.  I agree with KeiKei's review down below. She tells it straight!!!

       I have visited New Orleans 4 times now (5 soon) and eaten my fair share of their food (from local dives to their finest places).   Lola's food is lacking the \"pop\" of flavor you get down there. Also, seems like they over char a lot of food.     
     They should be ashamed of what they call \"Char Broiled oysters\"..   a tourist trap named \"ACME Oyster House\" in NOLA is around 10 times better than this abomination. 
   Red beans and rice was OK, salmon was OK and gumbo was OK.  All lacking flavor, I make better stuff using Zatarain's.  
       Get real, reviewers!   if you give this place 5 stars, that means your taste buds will just explode if you actually eat some real Cajun/Creole."}
{"text":"My second time to the restaurant, hoped for better results as they pretty much botched my birthday last year. Made a reservation for my mom's birthday about a week in advance and called throughout the week to make sure everything was good to go. We arrived early and were told we'd be sat in about half an hour. I was fine with that as we showed up early. We were sat 25 minutes after our reservation time. Might I also add that I had a three year old little girl in my party? Try keeping a toddler under control in a hallway for an hour and a half. It's a real shame that I won't be coning back because as a New Orleans native, I love the food. But they're not the only game in town."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Best jambalaya I've ever had - even better than anything I had in New Orleans."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite places to go....
Was nervous after my first visit. I don't like the taste of fish  (not allergic, just don't like it) and could taste that my chicken had been cooked on the same grill as a previous fish dish...HOWEVER, that was a one time experience. Never had a fish taste on my meal again, and I've been here A LOT since then. 
Love the staff and the ambiance makes me feel im back in NOLA.
Perfect place to go before a show at the Smith Center.
Small place, cozy....you can be dressed in either shorts or a suit and be comfortable here."}
{"text":"After watching the episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and saw Lola's featured, I had to give it a try.  The place was crowded as my wife and I went for lunch last week.  We waited only 10 minutes and got a seat inside.  The decor is awesome, since it sets the mood for your meal.  It's not a large restaurant, but there's also seating outside.

We enjoyed the Crab Cake appetizer to start our meal.  My wife ordered the Gumbo and I had the Jambalaya.  Both entrees were delicious.  The flavors jumped-out at you and there was sufficient heat as well.  To top it all off, we ordered the Bananas Foster for dessert.  This was the perfect ending to a fabulous meal.  

Our server Kindra was awesome, friendly and courteous.  Just another gem to add to my list of good restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was great!!!  BBQ shrimp, oysters, and the crawpuppies, all phenomenal!!  The waitress seemed a little overwhelmed, and the place isn't very big.  Anybody can have a bad day, great place, great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over 7 years and it is just as amazing as the first time I ever visited! It is very small, maybe only seating 30 people max. They have about 4 tables that are set up outside as well. The restaurant is decorated in New Orleans mardi gras theme. Their specialty gouda grits are savory and such a great side dish for anything they have on the menu! I typically order the bronzed catfish which is salty, charred, and perfection really.

I love this restaurant. It's a hidden gem that I've been frequenting for years. It is reasonably priced and the staff is very friendly. You can tell when you dine that this is a locals spot and the restaurant has worked on creating loyalty with their guests."}
{"text":"I'm from the South and that means I very picky when it come to sweet tea and grits!  

After hearing our friends talk abt this place, we finally got around to checking it out. It lived up to all our expectations and more!  My husband had the catfish and grits and I got a blackened shrimp po boy. I personally did not get a grits dish because of my hesitations. All I can say is AMAZING!!!  Next time it's blacked shrimp and grits for me!!  

We were so stuffed from lunch that we passed on desert, but that will happen next time as well!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem of southern comfort and the kind of place you almost do not want others to find. If you do luck out and end up here, you cannot go wrong with the shrimp and grits or blackened catfish. Oh and save some room for the bananas foster and sweet potato pecan pie."}
{"text":"Have been here 2 times & it's been great. 2nd time around I started off with the bronze shrimp po boy for an entree. Had the gumbo appetizer which was great and had some good kick to it. For dessert had the bananas Foster bread pudding unbelievably awesome. Great service with our large group of 12 people. Only downside was the venue is very loud as it constantly packed with people. The first time I was there I had the fried soft shell crab appetizer and the oyster po boy with the regular bread pudding for dessert. I'd have to say the bananas foster bread pudding is better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to take people. They have the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. I went twice last week. I am a server and when anyone asks where else to check out in Las Vegas this is the first place I put on the list. Service is always solid too. Bread pudding is killer. Crab cakes were okay. Fried oysters are great. Sweet potato fries were great. It's all great."}
{"text":"My gf and I did our date night here and have never eaten at a creole place before. Our waitress Megan was very attentive and even went as far as bringing a sample of the creole sauce out to taste it to see if I'd like it. I didn't request that, I simply had some questions about the sauce while ordering and she took the initiative in bringing a sample out to be sure I'd like it. She was great!

The food came out and we ordered a deep fried soft shell crab which was good to share. We also shared a bowl of gumbo which was very delicious.  Our entres were both very good (Shrimp creole & Shrimp n Grits). Finally desert came (bananas foster) which was just OK. Def not the best I've had - plain Jane desert, wish we would have ordered the seasonal Apple bread pudding instead. 

One of the girls clearing our plates was on the phone talking which was a little rude and we sat near the kitchen wall and every few minutes someone was poking there head out and we were the only ones in sight of them so that was starting to get old - them popping their heads out and locking eyes every time. 

4 out of 5 stars - overall was a good change up for date night and would probably recommend it to a friend looking for a smaller portioned menu with a slightly different menu in a quant place."}
{"text":"It's really something when I have to go to Vegas to get some cajun fare when I was just in \"Nawlins\" last year.  I have to say, Lola's trumped several of the popular restaurants in NO.  Lola's has been on my food list for a couple years and last week, we made it.  On Fat Tuesday.  I didn't realize it was Fat Tuesday until I stepped onto the casino floor and saw all the festivities.  

Lola's is small, but I like the genuine southern-look.  Lola, herself, was passing out beads and welcoming people in.  Obviously she has a local following because she knew most of the room by name.  Later, we see her in the kitchen working as if she was a line cook.  I love that about owners.  You get right in there with your staff and get those dishes out.  Not like the \"celeb\" chefs who only lend their name to a restaurant and you get dishes that taste like crap, but you've paid for the name on the door.

We ordered:
Crawpuppies with Spicy Aioli-type sauce:  These are hushpuppies with crawfish ground into the mix.  A delight!
Fried catfish with sweet potato fries and slaw.  The fish was golden and fried to perfection.
Fried oysters with rice and greens:  I am leery when ordering greens as everyone does them differently.  Lola's greens were collards and they were done wonderfully with bits of hamhock or bacon.  With a dash of tabasco, I was hooked.  The oysters were so succulent, not over-fried.  Thanks Lola!  

By the time we left, there was a line out the door.  So glad we got in at just the right time."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm a vegetarian and therefore no expert in Cajun food. That being said, I thought this place was great. 

The options for me were obviously limited. I went with veggies over angel hair pasta, cooked with some Cajun spices. It was delicious, although I wasn't raving nearly as loud as the others at my table, who were eating some sort of shrimp over cheese grits... they loved it and talked about it all night. The other vegetarian offering was fettuccine alfredo, which you can never go wrong with. 

We shared a few bottles of wine and the others passed around the oysters as an appetizer, which I hear was very well done. The place has got a nice New Orleans atmosphere (especially if you are a Saints fan) in a smaller restaurant that would be perfect for dinner for two. 

I'd give them 4 1/2 stars if I could, and my pals may have gone higher. If you're looking for a nice restaurant that is off the strip, reasonably priced and delicious (especially if you like seafood), check this place out!"}
{"text":"Straight up killer Cajun grub! Sassy service was well appreciated too. My only gripes was no mixed drinks (aka monsoons or hurricanes) or oysters that were not cooked but other than it was slamming. Oh and a really great beer selection. Appreciated by this beer snob!"}
{"text":"Had a great time this weekend at Lola's the shrimp and grits were the best I ever ate. Crab cake delicious my granddaughter had the PO boy soft shell crab also good. My sister had the grilled oysters yummy. Bread pudding I've had better but it was tasty. My fam that ordered the jambalaya found it too spicy to eat so it went back. All in all a good eat. Oh yeah my granddaughter said the banana pudding was good but not as good as yours granny. I love that chick."}
{"text":"Well let's start from the beginning my group was seated fast but the waitress took forever to come over actually had to get her attention to come over and the place was not busy. Next let's go over food sweet tea good crab cakes and craw puppies  and soft shell blue crab are good appetizers entrees shrimp and grits are good stay away from ettoufee it taste horrible fried catfish was ok just lacking seasoning  fried well but needed salt or something same thing with red beans and rice needs salt badly if you know anything about beans you must cook with some form of salt I hope the read this review because the food needs it i was excited to try this place but wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits with andouille sausage and mushroom ragout was out of this world. This was the best meal I've had since moving to Vegas.

The atmosphere was great - very relaxed and friendly. A band was playing out front masking the traffic sounds with authentic New Orleans brass. Our waiter inside was super friendly, relatable, and attentive. 

They serve a tasty local Louisiana brew, Abita SOS (Save Our Shore), which is a \"Charitable Fund\" that will assist with the rescue and restoration of the environment, industry and individuals fighting to survive the disastrous Gulf Coast oil spill."}
{"text":"Visiting for the weekend and a family member recommended Lola's. I got bronzed chicken with grits and mushroom ragout. Afterwards was Lola's traditional famous bread pudding with pecan sauce. Oh so good!!! #lolaslouisianakitchen #vegas #lunch #creolefood"}
{"text":"Lola's is one of the best southern cooking you will find in Las Vegas. It's located in the artsy downtown with a very southern vibe! The appetizers were amazing, and entrees were delicious. I highly recommend the spicy gumbo and for an entree I always go back for the Shrimp Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ordered the chicken salad and chicken fingers both with the spicy option. Soooo good I've been craving it ever since. Chicken was fresh and so was every ingredient. Fast friendly service and comfortable atmosphere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best grilled bread ever!!! Every time I come to Las Vegas I have to stop here FIRST, or else I'll have an attitude my whole trip. Lol"}
{"text":"Word to the wise: make sure you eat before you go so that by the time your food arrives, you'll be hungry again.

I'm just disappointed that I had to wait 20 minutes to be greeted by our server without the thrill of a lap dance.

We were so thrilled when our server finally arrived, that we gave him our drink, appetizer, and entree selection. I'm not sure if you've heard, but this is how service at a restaurant normally works: You arrive, you're greeted by the host/hostess then seated at the proper table that will accommodate your party size comfortably. Next, the server or server assistant greets you within 5 minutes to take your drink order and offer some appetizer suggestions. Once the drinks arrive they take the order for both your appetizer and your entree or just your appetizer and give you some more time to look over the menu while they put your appetizer in...should I say more? Guess what happened after he took all three orders? Another 20 minutes of staring at each other and our appetizers arrived. They took so long to get to us, I forgot what we ordered! Apparently, we ordered the Craw Puppies. They were good, an innovative dish with an original sauce to match.

Unfortunately, the appetizer was a tease for the beast (my stomach). Guess what came after the appetizer? Another wait...by this time, I was trying to think happy thoughts and sing some lullabies to keep the beast distracted. My date asked if we could have some bread (since all the other tables around us had some) while we were waiting. He also asked the server if he could check on the status of our food. My date decided to take a smoke break while I started to die in slow motion and feel my stomach feed off itself.

Finally, our food arrives. I had ordered the catfish platter which came with two sides. I chose greens and sweet potato fries. The starvation I was experiencing made me so delusional that I actually thought the word \"platter\" meant more than one piece of fish. Nope...just one. As long as the food took, I was hoping that the cook had gone to the lake and caught a  school  of fish for me to eat. Can you believe that after all that my greens were gross & cold?! AND my sweet potato fries were lukewarm. Unfortunately, I had to work the next day...so I couldn't send them back. I did ENJOY my  catfish, however, as long as it took to make...I was expecting it to be ORGASMIC. I did want to try dessert, but like I said before...I had to work the next evening.


The moral of the story? LUKEWARM THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT!

MANAGEMENT: AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR A 2 COURSE MEAL?! ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME?!! Please feel free to retrain your staff using my tips as a guide. I swear, I won't even take credit for it."}
{"text":"Sweetest service ever and absolutely amazing food. This was one of my family's favorite meals in Las Vegas. Pretty sure I almost exploded attempting to eat the bananas foster bread pudding, but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time. Had the shrimp with grits was impressed it was really good. Portion size of food is decent. Place is a bit cramped but overall great place. Make reservations before going there."}
{"text":"Great food! I tried the Bronzed Shrimp and Gouda Grits and it was excellent! I went on a Monday night and it was crowded. If you have to wait it is worth it. Lola was greeting and seating guests. Everyone was very friendly.  I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Lola's and probably one of my few southern style restaurants, but I enjoyed my experience there.  It had a very cozy ambience with friendly service.  Oh and how cute!  Lola actually picked up the phone to take my reservation!  

Here's the spotlight on the food =)
1.  Charbroiled Oysters - \"Fresh Oysters charbroiled the Cresent City way, with lots of garlic, lemon and a blend of cheeses.\"  Usually I shy away from any cooked type of half shell oysters suspicious that it is the stuff that they're trying to hide the unfreshness of with cooking it.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with my favorite robust flavors of garlic and cheese and the lovely toasted slices of french bread
2.  Crab Cakes - \"Lump Crab in Lola's special blend of spices, pan fried and served w/Lemon-garlic Aioli.\"  This is not the usual crab cake you'd expect.  It seems to be 99% crab meat.  Not crispy but very crab meaty.
3. Fried Oyster Po Boy on New Orlean's French Bread fully dressed, meaning that it comes with all the slaw glory.  I love po boys!  I enjoyed the deep fried goodness of the oyster with the slaw a bam of hot sauce.  bam bam!
4.  Jambalaya with chicken, sausage and shrimp - fluffy flavorful rice 
5.  Etouffee - a cross between a roast and a gumbo.  Gravylicious

Dessert!
1.  Louisiana chocolate sheath cake - the cake was very light but every bite was a chocolate dream.  We made it a la mode with praline icecream and it was perfect!
2.  Bananas Foster - loved the flavor, but hated the mushiness.  I've had others where it was not so mushy.

Conclusion:  All the flavors were excellent.  One southern style food restaurant under my belt.  Woot.  

p.s.  Keep in mind portion sizes are more realistic rather than humongous American portions sizes.  Expect well prepared food vs.  over compensation with size."}
{"text":"FINALLY made it here! And it was worth the wait! Loved my dish! Got the bronzed catfish with grits with a side of jambalaya. I was very happy with the results. I've been to New Orleans and had Creole food. Lola's wasn't too far off taste wise. Obviously not as fresh because we're not by the water, but still pretty scrumptious. I'd definitely return even though The prices are a little expensive. THE GRITS ARE UNBELIEVABLY WONDERFUL !!!!! My goodness I want more!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food & staff have been great everytime. The gumbo is a must! Just be careful with large groups, it's a small location with limited seat. On a good night the outside seating is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Lola's!  Once again a fabulous dinner. I take friends and family here when they visit from out of town. They always insist on having Lola's when they come again. My in laws were not let down this time either. Thanks Lola's!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat.  We usually go here for special occasions like my birthday. I have the bronzed catfish and grits and banana pudding.  We have the oysters usually and my husband orders the etoufe. Every dish we have tried has been out of this world.  I love the Chicory coffee. Make reservations,  space is small and they fill up fast. Service is good. Friendly staff but not overly attentive. I enjoy the festive atmosphere. 5 plus stars for me."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and great food.

We had lunch there.  The soft shell crab po'boy and oyster po'boy were excellent.  The gumbo was good also.  It's too bad that it's kinda out of the way, but we will definitely come back when we are in the Vegas area again."}
{"text":"Yummy food, cold brew, excellent service every time we've been. We have tried nearly everything on the menu, have not had a bad meal..."}
{"text":"Food fun and great atmosphere. A few mins to wait but so worth it! You gotta try this! Wow, I will be back. Get a fig dessert - so so good!"}
{"text":"Our family loved everything we had: Shrimp Charlotte, Roast Beef po-boy, Blackened Shrimp po-boy, red beans and rice, bananas foster, Louisiana choc cake. I can't wait to go back!

Update: We returned to Lola's 3 months later and loved it just as much as the first time. Add Shrimp Creole and Shrimp and Grits to the list of delicious fare."}
{"text":"I'm still fairly new to Vegas so I use Yelp to help me locate delicious food in my area. Lola's is about a mile away from where I live and I'm so glad I found this super small but super delicious restaurant. My best friend and I decided to stop in for lunch one afternoon to avoid a wait. We were seated immediately and each ordered a sweet tea to start. After reviewing the menu we decided to go with the broiled oysters, neither of us had ever tried cooked oysters but we love raw oysters so we figured we should be adventurous. I'm not going to lie, I was a little nervous about these but they were absolutely delicious, my best friend and I said they would be on our list of must gets every time we go to Lola's. For our entrées, my best friend ordered the roast beef sandwich, I know that wasn't the name of it but it was a delicious sandwich that he let me have a few bites of. I got the gouda grits with shrimp, which I let my best friend have a few bites out of all though I really didn't want to share. It was such a wonderfully executed dish, my only complaint was that I finished it so quickly and wanted more. Luckily, I remembered that the Yelp reviews said to leave room for the bread pudding, which was just as amazing as everything else. If heaven has a taste, I'm almost certain it's the food from Lola's."}
{"text":"Crawfish, appetizers, and Abita beers- you'll find me seated at the bar cheering during LSU games all fall. Quality of dishes and freshness of seafood are on point and service is southern-style friendly.

Recommend:
CRAWFISH by the pound- didn't specify any flavoring because it is perfect as-is. Good portion size, variety of sized 'fish (some bigger, some smaller), hot and fresh.
CRABCAKE- delicious on top of a frisee salad and with an L-shaped drizzle of lemon-mustard mayo sauce that perfectly complements the flavors, nicely crisped. 

As for entrees, I was less impressed. Quality and freshness are still there, but this part of the menu is overpriced for the small portions.
SHRIMP & GRITS- $17, too much gravy and too little grits left me with a puddle at the bottom of my dish. Five flavorful, blackened shrimp were plenty, but grits were a smear in the middle of the bowl instead of the star. And they were gluey.
JAMBALAYA- $11, served in a tureen you might find a side of asparagus in. Packed with flavor, added \"extra\" shrimp for $4.20 and got a total of 4, not sure how many come with the dish regularly or if \"extra\" is meant to mean \"add some to it in the first place.\"

Décor is on point and in keeping with true Louisiana style, but Ambiance of the restaurant was more like a slightly-rowdy bar, due in large part to the riotous group seated beside us, screaming with laughter. Good times a-rollin' here.
Will come back for LSU games or a poboy lunch, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to coming to this spot since seeing it on Triple D and to also support my fellow New Orleanian.  The site was so cute & decorated with New Orleans fare throughout.  Tables were secure and it was clean.  There is also a grill in the front.  It is small but intimate. Servers were very nice.  Hence one star.

If you enjoy cayenne pepper & a runny nose, this is your spot.  I am from New Orleans, born & raised & I was insulted.  This food had absolutely no flavor.  Not only did it not have flavor the gumbo was uneditable it had so much cayenne.  It tasted as if the only spice was cayenne and no base in any smoked meat or flavor enhancers like bay leaf, smoked necks as the base, and garlic powder, onion powder, granulated garlic or anything.  Nothing I had was from home.  I also had the crawfish.  Sadly cayenne was the star.  The potatoes that they added to the boil were not boiled with any kind of salt. Ever had a boiled or baked potatoe without salt?  Horrible.

My table mate had the crawfish étouffée.  Cayenne abounded and no flavor.  She said the rice was fluffy.  Another table mate had the green beans & I'd ordered the greens.  Greens lacked anything & tasted like they came from a can.  Bacon pieces were obvious.  The green beans had a good crunch & a little flavor.  We also ordered the grilled oysters for our table.  They were seasoned with Italian dressing.  Different and average.

I do not understand all the four & five stars here.  Palates are different but good food never changes and is consistent.  Lola's is a wanna be Louisiana kitchen.  We have a Lola's in New Orleans & I encourage every Yelper to eat there if ever in town.  This Las Vegas Lola is an imposter in the highest order."}
{"text":"If you don't know where this place is, it can be very easy to miss.  The owner is actually from NOLA...she proudly displays her Saint's gear in the restaurant.  The food and the staff truly brings me back to NOLA.  The etouffee and jambalaya are delicious."}
{"text":"I will try to keep this short and sweet. We came here for my 30th birthday for dinner since I was craving for Cajun and found this place on Yelp. It's quick to pass up if you're not paying attention. Look for that big \"Holsum Bread\" neon sign and you'll find Lola's right next to it on the left. I had made a reservation because I read it was quite small inside and we went on a Saturday night.

Here's a list of what we ordered:

* Jambalaya-Chicken & Sausage
* Gumbo
* Grilled Oysters
* Shrimp Po'Boy
* Catfish Po'Boy
* Catfish Platter with Sweet Potato fries
* Bananas Foster with Bread Pudding

There was 4 of us and we all basically shared our food with each other. We all really enjoyed our food and for a person that absolutely is disgusted with Oysters, I gave these a try and was shocked that I actually was pleased with them. Of the Po'Boys, the Shrimp was my favorite...so far =) and Jambalaya had the perfect kick to it.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for some Cajun/Creole food. I am absolutely, 100% coming back here!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the bronze catfish w/ grits and the crawpuppies. Beer menu was pretty awesome too. The girlfriend had the crabcake dinner which was just ok.  It's not one of their stronger menu items. Location is great and would recommend a reservation on a weekend evening.
My only criticism is the servers were subpar to what you'd expect at a 24 hr cafe. The venue is a little spendy, so I expect some fundamentals of service from a wait staff. It's not worth getting into and doesn't reflect the quality of the food, but definitely was reflected in their tip."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Triple D.

My expectations were way to high for this place. 

The service was terrible. It took our waiter 10 minutes to get our water. We didn't get our bread and crab cake another 20 minutes. We didn't get our entree food until about 1 hour after ordering. Other people got their food way faster than we got our food and we were there before them. We were really ready to walk out on this place. If it weren't for my partner suggesting to stay I would've walked out. 

The food was mediocre. The Shrimp and Grits was \"okay.\" nothing I would eat again. The grits were very gummy and gritty. The Shrimp was good and very well seasoned.  Pauls Jambalaya tasted good. Nothing we'd order again. I don't think we'll be coming here anytime soon. 

But then again our service was terrible so maybe I am judging the food to hard."}
{"text":"The food was great! Reminiscent of down south, southern comfort food."}
{"text":"This has been some of the best food that I have had in Vegas so far (and that is saying something). The staff was so friendly and they have gluten free options! May not recommended for strict celiac though. If we end up moving here this well def be my go to spot for good cajun comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and not sure what can they get there food out of. Most of her food is the same color , a grey brown and if you get something that doesn't come in gravy , its dry . Staff only likes certain kind of people , other wise not friendly at all . They even count how much bread you get . It made me run back to little jewel of new orleans in Los Angeles ."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Come here about once or month and have not had a single bad experience. At this point I have ordered most of the menu and have loved everything, particularly the craw puppies.  If you like cajun style food, this is the place to go in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was awesome. Some dishes can get a little pricey, but overall not bad. You must have the banana foster bread pudding. To die for!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the soft shell crab po boy and it was so freakin good!!! I wanted to eat his food but I just ate my cup of Gumbo. This was my second time eating Gumbo, nothing against theirs but now I know I just don't like Gumbo period. I did love the charbroiled oysters! We also ordered the crab cake it was good.  We ordered the banana foster bread pudding and it was DELICIOUS!!!! Place is kinda small but it's ok. The service was great! We'll be back to try more items on the menu =)"}
{"text":"I just died and went to Cajun heaven!

Vegas doesn't have a lot of hole in the walls or even authentic cuisine from any country. But oh my.. I had the shrimp and grits, MOUTHGASM. The hush puppies and po-boys are on point! 

I loved the service, everyone makes you feel at home.. Keep it up y'all!"}
{"text":"Lola's is an absolute MUST. Best meal I've ever had in Vegas. Nice, homey ambiance, excellent wait staff, FABULOUS food!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from the south and spend a lot of time in NOLA. I have to admit I was really skeptical. Lola's has impressed me. I had the catfish po'boy and it was great. We had banana fosters bread pudding and banana pudding. The banana pudding was just like the stuff I grew up on. It really hit home. If you want New Orleans food in Vegas, go to Lola's. AAA+++"}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Lola's it takes me right back home. There fish & grits are amazing and very flavorful. If you get a chance check it out!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here if you like it spicy  this is the place to be the red beans and rice was on  everything was seasoned to my liking .... it taste so good make you want to slap yo momma"}
{"text":"I love Lola's! All of their food is great! The shrimp and grits are to die for! The best sweet tea in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable with great service. We had the catfish PoBoy, cheese grits and chargrilled oysters and bread pudding. The oysters were small but so delicious, so order 12! Be sure and order the cheese grits and bread pudding.  Everything that was coming out of the kitchen looked delightful. Just off the strip. Worth the drive. We went about 3pm. no wait. It is a small restaurant so I am sure they fill up."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few more times. Very tasty food. The sandwiches are ok but my least favorite however the other entrees are EXCELLENT. When I was there Lola introduced herself and eagerly listened to any feedback.  Like everyone said before the bread pudding is finger licken good."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken po boy was very tasty!  From the bread to how the chicken was seasoned.  I also tried the catfish with grits and it was amazing.  Not a fan of grits so my opinion on it would be very bias.  Next time I want to try the catfish po boy."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to eat Louisiana food when you are not in Louisiana! The Red Beans & Rice was perfect, my Crawfish Etoufee was so tasty and his Jambalaya had the perfect amount of heat! Lola's is a small restaurant in a strip mall on a busy street but don't let that deter you. We ate at 6pm and had no problem getting seating right away. By 7pm it was almost full."}
{"text":"Been on vacation for at least 4 days now sitting here at Lola's and the food is just amazing! I had to stop and text this review out ! #breadpudding"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! I  usually order the Bronzed Shrimp & Grits with Andouille Sausage & Mushrooms... mmm, mmm, mmm! The dining room is small & thus noisy, but the food is fantastic & the service is always wonderful!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying my last name is Ardoin. Yes, I am Cajun French and I was born and raised on South Louisiana cuisine. This is a place that I believe everyone should check out. First, the crab and artichoke dip is a dish that would sell anywhere on the planet! I would come here solely for this dip alone. Second, the shrimp étouffée is simply brilliant and brings me back home to my Maw maw's cooking. The roux is colored nice with rich flavor. Lastly, the bananas foster is so good that it spoke to my soul. If you haven't checked this gem out, then stop reading this review and get your Who Dat on right now and head over to Lola's"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, and it is with regular frequency, I can't help but want to start carrying around a hanky to dab away the southern heat and take on a nice southern  accent to go along with it.  This place brings up all sorts of wonderful imagery - everything about New Orleans life is rich and full of flavor and this restaurant plays into that.

It's located downtown - right near Charleston and Main St.  This is perfect for First Friday art scene goers, and it usually serves as my go-to spot for pre-festivty dinner.  This last Friday I ordered the Gumbo and the Shrimp and Grits.  I can say that the Gumbo was fairly average.  

But I can't take that away from the restaurants score because the Shrimp and Grits absolutely beat everything I'd had in the last month.  They were buttery.  They were cheesey.  They melted and they spiced.  And it was the sort of food that makes you take a double because it was just that beautiful.  A dish of dishes - I will order this every time and be thankful.

My niece also ordered the Fried Chicken and couldn't finish it because of the large portions (which meant it was mine for the taking!).  It was clean chicken breast fried up to brilliance, and I was very satisfied with it.  Everyone at the table gave the dishes a try, almost family style, and we all left happy and full.

I'm still not from New Orleans, nor do I have a cool accent.  But for a while, sitting in this joint, I almost feel like I fit in.  And I'm certain fed like it."}
{"text":"Decent food and great atmosphere. They seem a bit short staffed though. Waited two hours after being promised 40 minute wait time. Then took 10 minutes for drinks to hit our table and then 40 minutes for food to hit the table. People (family of 3) were seated after us (5 friends) and served their food first. The prices were ok, but just put off by the long wait. They can customize a lot of the food to tailor your spice preference. Would probably not go back to be honest."}
{"text":"I had been to Lola's one time a few years ago and always wanted to go back. I remembered how crowded it gets so I was happy to see that it takes reservations, especially since this was in the middle of my work day. It was crowded when we walked in- and we were  instantly welcomed by the workers and shown our high top table that was reserved. Both my friend and I got the chicken salad- I got it grilled and she got it fried and both of us made it spicy with a 7/10 on the spice scale. Food was delicious, service was just the right pace- and we both like spicy a lot and found their flavor to be delicious. Next time I think I'll get an extra side of the spicy sauce to add into my salad along with the chicken being tossed in it. It was an extremely tight fit though- we were tucked into a corner next to the grill and counter seats- I would have preferred a seat in the main dinning room that would have given us some more surface area. I know it's a popular place so I actually really appreciate how they try to get as much seating as possible, but I still feel like a sardine when I'm told \"excuse me\" by staff every few minutes. 

Great experience, great food- will definitely be back and be trying the new location in Summerlin soon!"}
{"text":"I love the name Lola.  If I could convince my husband to name one of our way-down-the-line, future children, Lola, I would.  Not because of this restaurant, but because I like the name.  And I like the song.

But I digress.

While me and the hubs were leaving the outlet mall after working up an appetite from shopping, we were at a loss for where to go to lunch.  As we are at the stop light in front of Lola's, which is located next to that old Holsum Bakery (you've seen it- bright neon lights on Charleston, with a large clock), I made a fast turn into the parking lot.

We walked into Lola's and its a very small, quaint little place that has that has that feel of \"this could be either really good or really bad\".  Luckily for us, it was good!

Our waiter, totally forgot his name (Frankie?) was really nice and gave us plenty of time to decide what we wanted.

We decided to share a crab cake appetizer and the Bronzed Catfish and Grits.  Me, being from the Midwest, I've never had grits and was very excited to try them!

On the menu, it says there is a $5 charge for sharing, but it's just there to discourage people from doing that all the time, so there really isn't a charge- hooray!

OMG- the Bronzed Catfish & Grits- Fresh bronzed Catfish served over Smoked Gouda Grits with an Andouille Sausage and Mushroom Ragout.  Totally DELISH!  WOW!  

The seasonings on the catfish will blow you away- perfect amount, just a tiny bit of spice (if you don't like spicy, you will love this as there isn't really any spice at all), cooked flaky.  The grits, ohhh man, the grits.  These gouda grits are so yummy!  creamy and have great flavor!  I don't like sausage (hey- get that 6th grade humor outta here! ;) ) but this was very good.  However, I don't remember a mushroom ragout... maybe it was mixed in?

I would layer my fork with catfish, grits & sausage and smile as i was chewing, it was that good.

The crab cake appetizer was good, but unfortunate for us, we asked for it to come out with the catfish & grits and the catfish & grits totally took over and we ignored the crab cake.

We would love to come back and try the crawfish... we hear Friday's are the day to enjoy them!

We will be back... L-L-Lola, L-L-Lola!"}
{"text":"My partner and I have been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and both times were great. They have excellent service. We happened to sit at a small table in the bar area each time and didn't have any issues getting good, attentive service.
The food is wonderful and captures the greatness of southern Cajun Louisiana food perfectly. The bourbon shrimp and grits is especially tasty and our last visit we tried the Roman Trio which was also good. Recommend reservations if you want a regular table or especially 4 or more people since bar area quite small."}
{"text":"I had the Bronzed Catfish and Grits with pork sausage.   It was a wonderful, taste popping meal.   The grits are a restaurant specialty that includes smoked gouda cheese as one of their ingredients.   This place is directly south of the premium outlets.   We stayed parked and walked to Rick's Restorations, which is across the rail tracks from their parking lot.   This restaurant was featured on DDD."}
{"text":"great food just the growth of down town las Vegas has made them too small to keep up with the demand of the growing night life scene me and my wife were offered a table in there \"hall\" what we did not know is that it is one table in a hallway they had placed here not even a part the restaurant. If you don't have a reservation don't come!"}
{"text":"Very slow getting in, although we had a reservation. Observed open tables but still had to wait. Slow getting service when we waited, laddies ice tea totally forgotton."}
{"text":"I love Lolas! I don't eat a lot of seafood or sausage but I can always find something great to eat here. And my main reason for going there is the bananas foster, it's amazing! I can't usually find it anywhere else in town consistently and I always know it's here and delicious! Service is always good and the beer is good!"}
{"text":"Very good food and worth the trip.   Near Ricks Restoration and Pawn Stars TV show locations.     Will be back soon."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a Family Birthday Party at the end of October and we had relatives from Texas, Colorado, California and Nevada join in for a goodbye luncheon.  I suggested Lola's based on a friends recommendation.  We went to the Lola's in Summerlin which was not too far out of the way from \"The Strip\" and easy to find off the freeway.  I am happy to say that everyone really enjoyed the food!  I tried Grits for the first time (served with shrimp) and it was amazing!  We had 12 people in our party, the weather was great so we sat outside and our waitress really tried to meet all of our requests.  She did an amazing job!  With twelve people, you can imagine all the different orders so we all did a lot of sharing and tasting.  There was a great bar crowd watching a Saints game and the place was just so alive.  I cannot wait to go back and try other dishes and definitely order another plate of Grits!"}
{"text":"This place was a five hands down. We had fried soft shell crab, gumbo, crab cakes and the shrimp and grits.  All were amazing!!!  I have to admit the shrimp and grits were my favorite, but all of the dishes were great. 

The server was polite and on point. 

I would definitely get reservations.  The place is very busy, and for good reason."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Try to go on Fat Tuesday, and you get a special treat! I love their Po'Boys, last time I went, I had the blacken chicken which melts in your mouth. I would like to say hats off to the seafood gumbo and grits, its pretty hard to find places to get those two dishes right, and Lola does!

Since this is a pretty popular place, you might have to wait a little while to be seated, but the food is worth it. Can't wait to go back for Mardi Gras!"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy little restaurant. I ordered the fried catfish po boy and it was fried perfectly. Pretty much anything that is deep fried on their menu is good. Unfortunately the etouffe we ordered was under seasoned. Service was good."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Vegas.  If I could drive there weekly just to eat here, I would.  GREAT FIND.. Shrimp N Grits a MUST"}
{"text":"Food is ABSOLUTLEY delicious and true to the flavors of Louisiana!  The Bronze Shrimp with Gouda Grits is the BEST I've had.  Mushroom Ragout isn't spicy hot and makes the perfect gravy Server displayed excellent customer service and food arrived expeditiously.  Highly recommend this establishment.  Next time will order dessert. The only minor complaint I would have is the accommodations are a bit tight."}
{"text":"This will be a big statement but it might be the best food I've had in Vegas. I've been there at least 30-40 times and I was absolutely shocked and impressed at how good it was. Ironically, the conference a year ago was in New Orleans so I had something to directly compare it to and it was spot on! 

Let's see... crawfish were fantastic. The catfish and grits was out of this world. The oysters were good. And whatever else I had that night was lights out... oh, I know- banana pudding! I mean, not sure why I got it but it was money!

It's a bit off the beaten path but it's a small, unassuming spot with not too many tables. About 7PM the place was jam packed. People know where to find good food and it was evident here. I would absolutely tell you to come here for dinner if you're looking for amazing food with a pretty casual setting."}
{"text":"Dinner at Lola's tonight with some friends.  Two of us ordered fried oysters.  The order came with remoulade sauce.  We asked for some cocktail sauce (ketchup with horseradish).  We got a shot glass size plastic cup about 3/4 full - so maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of an ounce.  Seriously, imagine my shock when the bill came and Lola charged me .50cents for a smidgen of ketchup and horseradish sauce.  With your prices which I thought were reasonable, you have to add 50cents?  We're DONE with Lola's and will make sure we pass the word not to order cocktail sauce - certainly not the price but principle!!!!"}
{"text":"Well after almost a year of seeing the DDD show that showed this little spot off the 15 FWY we finally made it.....Was a last minute decision and was able to get in as 1 of their last clients of the day.   My husbands from Louisiana and I've been wanting to take him here and right away he felt as if he were home and was anxious to taste the food. 

Most everything we ordered from crab cakes to soft shell crabs were great, however I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo and I should of known since it wasn't fried the chicken came out under cooked the waitress was kind enough to take it back said they were going to redo the plate and she returned the same dish with the same chicken with parts of the chicken recooked and of course it was still under cooked...I pushed the chicken to the side and ate some of the pasta, she returned and I expressed to her that the chicken was still under cooked and she said Lola wanted to see it and took the plate away...I never got the plate back and she did remove it from the ticket however expressed that Lola said it was cooked....HUMMM I thought that when you dined out that the customer was always right.....guess not in this case?

I wasn't upset I wasn't dissatisfied with our meal(s) at all we enjoyed the vibe and the food however as a tip to Lola and her staff....If a customer says the food is undercooked that maybe it's not cooked enough for their liking and just fix it! 

I recommend this place if you go in earlier in the day not wait till your the last of the customers and don't get the greens unless you like allot of vinegar with your greens....The grits, soft shell crab and the artichoke dip is amazing, the gumbo was just okay!"}
{"text":"I love Lolas. I love to get shrimp and grits. But I do not like to be charged 13 dollars to add a piece of catfish to my order. And if you're gonna charge that much disclose that instead pressing extra items on customers. The manager made it right. Thank you"}
{"text":"This place is a must visit for all Vegas locals; and tourists, you cant go wrong either. Some authentic southern style eats go on in here. Cajun style everything. I come here all the time for lunch, because I am a student at the dental school right down the street. I always know that i'm in for a treat when I come here. Its hard to find high quality food off the strip, especially in this area, and this place succeeds to satisfy my appetite!

Must order the shrimp charlotte, and the fig dessert thingy is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Another foodie spot finally checked off my list. Mother of Cajun this place blows your socks off. This was the most flavorful meal I've had in a long time. I don't even remember my name right now! We had the shrimp & grits, crawpuppies , & the fig delight. And service was awesome-our waiter was super friendly & fast."}
{"text":"The atmosphere outside can be deceiving, however, let's get right to the food the catfish and grits, was music to my mouth and my soul! Wonderful service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Crab cakes and jambalaya and sweet potato pecan pie! First place we come to in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent shrimp Charlotte a gumbo...very cute decor.... Lots of good spice and a great rue......highly recommend....as close to NOLA as you can get without the plane ride"}
{"text":"\"Reserve ahead\"
This is a busy spot. We just walked in and had a 20 min wait. We came via bus from the strip so taxi not needed. Good was v good but perhaps heavy on salt. Desert pecan pie was exceptional. Also purple haze beer worth a try. You should go and try it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a five star rating. I absolutely loved the food the couple of times I've eaten there. However, service was miserable on my second visit.

Starting with the food - I've been able to try a bunch of items on their menu. The Catfish with grits is amazing. I've never been a big fan of grits, but Lola's has definitely changed my mind. It's not the tasteless mushy crap you get at other places. Both their shrimp po boy and philly cheese steak po boy are good, especially for their price. And their red beans and rice had great flavor to it, and even has some sausage mixed in with it. The only part that semi bothered me was they don't give you much rice with it. The proportion of rice to beans is extremely off. 

Now on to the service. The first time I went, there was only a couple other tables that were filled, and service was decent. It definitely wasn't the service I expected seeing as that they weren't very busy, but it was something I could live with. On my second visit, the service was miserable enough to make me never want to go back. 

After we were seated, we were not approached again for another 6-8 minutes. Someone finally took our drink orders, with the promise that our waitress would be any minute. He came back with our drinks, and another five minutes later - no one had approached us. Finally, the guy who took our drink orders, came back & said our waitress was busy and that he would take our food orders. I ordered a po boy and asked for it to be dressed. When the food came, it wasn't dressed. Our two drinks sat on our table empty for a good ten minutes. Finally, a waitress asked if our ice tea needed to be replenished, simply because she had a pitcher of ice tea in her hand, but completely ignored the other empty glass on the table. Also, the wait to get the check was long as well. 

By the end of the meal, I was so annoyed at the horrible service and wait time I had experienced. I can usually deal with sub par service, but Lola's took it to the extreme. 

Will I be back? I'm not quite sure. I'm in love with their food - but don't think I can handle another shitty experience."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Lola's very much! I've driven past it a million times (well, not a million, but many), and always wanted to stop in. 
It's not much to look at, and it is pretty small, but it is decorated with lots of New Orleans memorabilia and could accurately be described as quaint.
When we arrived shortly after 6p on a Thursday evening, it was only moderately busy, but by the time we left, Lola's was completely full, with people waiting outside for tables.
Service was very good, especially considering how busy they were. I especially appreciated the young bus boy politely asking each time if he may take away my dishes. 
I feel as though I didn't quite order the right thing (an oyster po-boy) and a side of the Gouda grits, because I wasn't especially impressed with the po-boy. It was okay, but nothing to write home about, and I've certainly had far better in NOLA. However, the grits were amazing! They were thick, dense, tasty, and the mushroom ragout and sausage only added to the flavor.
My dining companion loved his jambalaya, with the only complaint being that there wasn't enough of it! 
Next time I definitely will order one of the combo platters- the catfish looked amazing too! 
We finished with a delicious slice of the sweet potato pecan pie, which was a great way to cap off the evening.
Prices were very reasonable, with entrees ranging from about $15-$25. 
Just a note, Lola's only serves soft drinks, beer and wine- no hard liquor. That didn't bother me a bit, but some people might like to know! 
Bon Temps!"}
{"text":"Really like this place right off the 15 on Charleston - in the same center as the old Holsum bread place.  The owner is usually hanging around and is very friendly and easy to talk to.  I go mostly for lunch and usually sit at the bar, which is small but sufficient.  I can only speak for the sandwiches, but they have all been delicious.  Good bread and everything else falls in line.  They also have Abita beer which is a plus!  Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Definitely the place to eat when in Las Vegas. Delicious Louisiana Cajun food with the perfect amount of flavor and heat. Love it!"}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight.  We were running a little behind and arrived around 8:20. The host didn't mind at all even though they stop taking people at 8:30. We ordered the gumbo and crawpuppies as an appetizer. Gumbo was decent and we really loved the crawpuppies. I ordered the shrimp and grits and my boyfriend ordered the shrimp Charlotte. It was amazing!!! Grits were moist and had a good flavor and the shrimp was blackened a bit. Whatever sauce is on it had a kick to it. The shrimp Charlotte was good although I'm not big on pasta. We ordered the banana foster bread pudding too. Really tasty!!!!The total bill was $60 which was way cheaper than I expected. Service was good. Plus We are fans of the Saints so the inside was awesome. I'll be back for sure as it's hard to find creole food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Reasonable prices. The only con is that it's not a very big space so it can get crowded and a little noisy inside."}
{"text":"I made a same day late reservation on a Friday night and was able to get seated almost immediately. I thought the servers were very friendly and helpful and they knew their menu and because of that they made knowledgeable recommendations. Now on to the food! The food was amazing! I had the D'brees Poboy which was sooo mouthwatering good, the sandwich was roast beef smothered in gravy on a French roll,mayo,lettuce and onions. The sandwich was so savory and you can see the chef really takes pride in the tradition of the Poboy. The sandwich came with French fries which were made fresh from hand cut potatoes which just adds to the comfort the food envokes. My wife got the Gouda Grits which I think we're a ! I highly highly recommend you get them. I had never had grits before trying these so I had no preconceptions however after trying them I'm ruined for anyone else's grits. My wife also got the combo plater which consisted of shrimp, oysters, cat fish filets and crab cakes and two sides, she choose green beans and the Gouda grits I mentioned before. And in just one word the combo was phenomenal. The food was great, the staff great, the vibe friendly, the atmosphere casual."}
{"text":"Crawpuppies were PHENOMENAL.  There are only four in the order and that's not nearly enough.  I could have made a meal of these by themselves.  The remoulaude sauce on the side is very tasty, but completely unneeded.  The puppies by themselves are packed FULL of flavor.

We had the jambalaya and a roast beef po-boy, dressed.  Both were excellent.  The jambalaya isn't too spicy so it's good for those who don't want to much heat.  The roast beef was tender and covered in gravy, just the way it's done back home.

The staff is very friendly and attentive.  I definitely recommend this restaurant for those wanting a little taste of Louisiana."}
{"text":"The best food off the strip, nobody wants to pay $15 for a burger anyways.  We ordered the crawpuppies which were fabulous and I ordered the shrimp and grits and since I have eaten shrimp and grits at the birthplace in Charleston these definitely stand up to them.  My husband ordered a cup of gumbo and a fried shrimp po boy dressed.  This place is definitely worth getting off the strip and trying and also the service was amazing our waiter was amazing and so friendly which is another reason to get off the strip.  Also if you happen to be from the south, which my husband is and you miss your sweet tea I highly recommend their's it's perfectly sweet. Their prices are amazing as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Cajun restaurants I've ever dined. You could place this restaurant in New Orleans and it would compete with some of the best. My family and I have dined there twice, and I've sampled almost everything. The bottom line you cannot go wrong with anything you order. This restaurant was featured on Triple D and Guy hit this one out of the park."}
{"text":"The food was ok...but I guess I was expecting so much more due to the high reviews. I had the shrimp etoufee. Mother in law had blacked catfish and grits which tasted so much better. Pricey for the amount of food you get.

BUT I have to say, the bread pudding was AMAZING. I would give this place a shot again just to have the bread pudding/"}
{"text":"First time there this Friday with 3 friends, the service was very good and friendly. I ordered Crab cakes over a bed of greens, 3 oysters, and green beans. The crab cakes were good could have been much better without so much bay seasoning in them, the oysters were FRIED i was expecting raw, and the green beans were very mushy i would not order this again. My 3 friends were very happy with their dinners so i would give this place another try this time ordering the GRILLED oysters!"}
{"text":"So we sit down and look at the menu. I think \"S**t, the oysters are cooked! What kind of s**t is that?\"  I'll tell you what kind of s**t it is... Good s**t!  They're absolutely delicious. Roasted on the grill with pecorino and lemon. Then you smear it on grilled bread (kinda reminds me of escargot). Then my po boy came. I got the roast beef. Absolutely delicious. I think it's because of the gravy. Anyway. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The crab cake does not resemble the picture on the menu by a long shot! The photo depicts a nice lump filled crab cake, but in reality you get a crab cake with a tuna fish consistency. Please remove this item from the menu. Do not order this item."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits, shrimp and grits, shrimp and grits!!!  Incredible!  Ordered a bowl of Gumbo too, it was awesome too.  Can't wait to visit Lola's again when I return to Vegas in a couple of weeks!!!!"}
{"text":"So worth the long drive from Henderson. The grits alone make it worth it. The hotsauce is tasty and everything was fried perfectly! This place is amazing."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  My husband and I went for the 1st time the other night and he enjoyed catfish and grits (the best grits he's ever had) and I had chicken with a baked sweet potato and green beans.  Also had desert bread pudding and banana foster!  Definitely would recommend this great place."}
{"text":"Fantastic cajun food.  The craw fritters and the garlic bread were outstanding.  The gumbo and red beans and rice were amazing.  Really all the food was worth it and the staff was so attentive and friendly.  Must try in vegas."}
{"text":"If you are big on authentic New Orleans food, well it doesn't get any better than this!!! After living in New Orleans for over 16 years you become accustomed to what true Cajun food and favors taste like. And this is the BEST there is in Las Vegas. It's hard to pick only one favorite because I have so many!   Starting with the chargrilled oysters that are to die for! Then they have an awesome gumbo and the soft shelled crabs are amazing too! I have a hard time deciding between the shrimp creole, catfish and grits, and the fabulous poboys and now that its crawfish season, how can you resist getting them boiled in that famous Louisiana seasoning! Mmmm Good!   And last but not least no meal is complete without Lola's famous bananas foster bread pudding topped with ice cream and that crackled brown sugar glaze just dripping over the top! It's big enough to share especially if you've been drinking their famous Louisiana Abita Beer with your meal. Everything is authentic, everything including the service is great, they even ship their bread in fresh daily from New Orleans ...  It just doesn't get any better than that.  And that's why we eat there at least twice a month. We LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Good prices and fun band. The food tasted home made and touched perfectly on that good ol' Creole cuisine. The Shrimp et Touffe is amazingly rich. Oh and did I mention the Bananas Foster? It's to die for.  I think I'm a crawfish-crackin' pro now! Thanks Lola"}
{"text":"I can't believe that as much as I love Lola's, I'm just now reviewing it! Originally from Austin, TX, I am a consistent New Orleans visitor and fan. So, keep that in mind. Lola's is the closest you will find to New Orleans delicacies in Las Vegas. No other in Sin City comes close. While I wish the menu was more expansive (turtle soup, muffaletta), it does have what you crave: red beans & rice, jambalaya, gumbo..., etc. Plus, the wine & beer selection are great and service is even better. Small, but quaint, Lola's has become my go-to on those days when I'm just not ready to go home from the office yet."}
{"text":"Visited Lola's for the first time yesterday and I was less than thrilled.
Let's start with the parking is undersized and crowded, the restaurant packs you in as well with very small 2 top seating with people constantly bumping you and the wait staff is less than efficient.
Beyond that our food took longer than expected due to our waiter as a table across from us received their food at about the same time as us. They sat down 10 minutes after we ordered.
I tried the Jambalaya, which the rice was cold and the seasoning was not quite as good as Zatarains. My wife had a dish where the grits were tasty but also cold.

I cannot say I will try this again as there were so many things wrong with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I found out about Lola's from a friend at work.  She said it was a must do.  We finally got around to making a reservatoin (recommended) and we tried it on a sunday afternoon.  HOLY MOLY!!.  My family is from New Orleans.  My mother cooked some of the best creole food ever.  Notice, I said Creole, NOT cajun.  There is a difference between the two.  Cajun food tends to be HOT and spicy.  Creole food is just seasoned to perfection and does not burn your mouth.  It just gives you a really nice feeling and it is hard to quit eating it is so delicious.  Lola's has this down.  The Gumbo is tasty, seasoned well, not overseasoned and not spicy hot.  Just right.  I had a fried oyster poboy, we called it an oyster loaf in NO.  It was fabulous.  It really helps that they ship their french bread in from NOLA.  You just can't get french bread like that anywhere else.  I only wish they had a \"seafood gumbo\" with crab and shrimp.  That would be really good.  I will definetly be back again.  Remember, if you are looking for Cajun food, this is not the place, but if want Creole, get to Lola's.  Also, Have desert!  The bread pudding is amazing.  We shared it.  Next time I might get my own.  Will definitely go back and have told all my friends about it too.  Remember. of you are looking for HOT and SPICY cajun food, go somewhere else.  Go to Lola's for a fine Creole dining experience that you will never forget."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Louisiana cookin, then this is the place.  I'm not from there, so I can't speak from first hand experience, but those I went with and the people around me were definitely raving about how true it was to its southern roots.  Fried catfish, jambalaya, poor boy sandwiches, etc.

The ambiance of the place is pretty cool too.  Pictures of the train cars in the south, mardi gras hats and masks hanging from the ceiling and a family vibe that a lot of places can't achieve.

The food was excellent and the service was the same, which would typically earn 5 stars from me.  However, the AC seemed to not be working properly.  And in this Vegas heat, that is definitely something that needs to get fixed ASAP if you are gonna be running a business.  While I was sweating when I was eating my spicy jambalaya, this would have been ok, but since I was sweating while drinking my beer, that's not acceptable.  Hopefully they get the AC fixed soon so they don't sweat away their customers!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food. Great location near downtown. Must have the bread pudding."}
{"text":"It's a pretty small restaurant, however it is very good. The atmosphere is fun and the food is all delicious. My party had to wait a little to get seated, but that's only to be expected. We were a party of eight. Try the craw puppies!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Cozy and friendly, the staff is awesome and quick to serve. We sat at the bar and were promptly greeted by the owner herself who was quick to get us some grilled bread and beverages. My husband and i each ordered the shrimp po'boys, his blackened and mine grilled. Both were tasty and paired with some amazingly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside sweet potato fries. Capped off with some Abita beers we were in N'awlins heaven. I will visit here again! Lola rocks and even took time to visit with us and ask how our meals were while she worked behind the counter. :)"}
{"text":"This place takes you away from Vegas and lands you in Louisiana.  The food was on par with New Orleans and the quaintness of the restaurant makes you feel so relaxed.  I had the Jambalaya and it was delicious. We also had a piece of fried chicken and the breading and prep was perfect. I can't way to go back. I recommend it highly and I am sure you will want to go back too.  Try the local Joseph James  Weize Guy if you like a great Wheat Beer that's made nearby."}
{"text":"Lola's is solid. My wife and I went for dinner before a show at The Smith Center. It was very convenient. I had the Roman Trio. She had the red beans and rice. Both were good. The bread they brought was super yummy! The gumbo was my favorite, though it was like non I'd had before.  Very thick and they serve it with rice. Interesting. The crawfish ettoufe was yummy. Oh, get the crab cake. Yum! We'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  I would never go back no matter how good the food is.
Ignored for 10 min then finally ordered drinks from a busser person, another 10 min till unfriendly Crystal the waitress showed up with \" so what can I get you?\".  
After We placed our order, that was  the last time we saw her!  She didn't even bring our food out much less check on us.  Everytime we needed a refill or extra napkins, we gad to get it from a bartender.
We wanted to talk to the manager but e said he was too busy right now.
Very diappointed."}
{"text":"I was SO looking forward too Lola ever since I seen it on DDD and only hearing great things about the place from friends gone. The thing craving most was good true authentic Po Boy. You see them around town but all the ones ever tasted not mention names but horrible. I always felt starts with the bread if bread not true then say got problems. The bread was perfect. I got full dressing with my soft shell Po Boy option but well recommend it comes with the sauce/ shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes and the Soft Shell were MONSTERS. LIterally two on sandwich where just one alone more then half the size of the bread. It fried too perfection. All other Po Boys had not enough of protein order in the sandwich and all taste not as fresh. Lola the soft shell crab sure fresh just on size of them. The fries were good. I really looking forward too Po Boy once realize huge portion you got had no room for the fries. Still eat half! They have five or six of them on the menu. You can count on me going back not only try more Po Boy but so many other things want try jambalaya, gumbo, and goes on and on. 

The atmosphere if very much New Orleans flair from the Saints decorations, I love independent family run business feel, such small place probably hold less then hundred people, and seeing Lola active walking around the restaurant or going in the back cooking it up and talking guest refreshing see in restaurant owner cares. She greeted me walk in and nice person cool see on tv then in person. 

It was pretty packed so good thing just me. I sat at the bar even that is about as small as it gets think eight seats or less. It not bar bar but bartender was really nice guy. Talking stories with him at times. If anything you get too see them grill off bread serve too the tables for entertainment. Do have widescreen there too just saying. 

I huge fan of Lola. Without doubt for me if want TRUE too the HEART creole or new orleans cooking Lola is only place too go. Make sure if go busy times might  want put reservation really small restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has the New Orleans vibe on the inside but the food was not impressive one bit. It lacked the creole Cajun flavor I'm use to when eating a true Louisiana dish."}
{"text":"I have to say, after reading the reviews I was very disappointed by the  Yelp community.  This place should not have 4 stars.  I think that even 2 stars is being generous. I had high hopes for this place but they sizzled to the floor moments after I walked in.

We went to Lola's on a Friday evening.  It was busy like most restaurants in Vegas are on Friday so I don't hold it against the establishment.  What most people don't realize is that this is a TINY restaurant.  There are not very many tables at all.  It is insanely loud too.  The table we sat at was not even and we had to constantly shift weights on the table to keep it level.  Our order was taken pretty quickly after we arrive and we ordered some oysters for starters.  We use to live in coastal Washington so when a restaurant has oysters on the menu, we typically order them for the nostalgia they bring.  Our oysters were more than broiled, they were burned and hard to chew.  This is frankly one of the worst oyster experiences I have ever had.  Oysters should never be hard to chew.  There was liquor in them either.  Even broiled oysters should have a liquor--even if it is just a bourbon or butter based sauce, it needs to be there.  They cost us $12.49 for a plate of inedible chew-balls from the sea.  They were tiny too--like the size of dimes for the oyster meat--or, at least what was left of the oysters after the kitchen got their fiery hands on them! Because I understand that not every dish is created equally I still held my hopes high for the main course.

Those hopes were drowned by the 50 minute wait time from appetizer to entree.  We watched guests that were seated after us be served their dishes well in advance of us.  We really felt ignored.  Our waitress filled our water glasses once during the entire night--even though we were there a few hours.  

I ordered the Catfish platter which on the menu has a number 3 beside it, indicating there would be 3 fillets.  Because I spent a lot of time in the South and I love \"bronzed\" catfish I ordered mine to be the same.  I must note that bronzed fish in no way translates to dried, black, inedible fish.  When my plate finally arrived it had one very blackened piece of fish on it.  My fish was so dry I quit eating shortly after I started.   The seasoning was over salted as well.  The waitress never came to ask how my dish was either.  I was very disappointed.  For one piece of dried out horrible fish, it racked up the bill another $15.   My fiance ordered the the Shrimp Creole ($15.99) and his shrimp were also over cooked but not to the point where they were inedible.  So, he shared with me.   My daughter ordered a plain Caesar salad ($8.99) because there were no children's options and she is a vegetarian (this place is NOT vegetarian friendly at all--they actually make a point of hinting at that on the menu: most things are non-vegetarian and they make no acceptations or substitutions!  God forbid some grits not have chicken stock in them.)   

We ordered two glasses of  wine and were given the wrong type of wine or a very poor substitution for what we ordered.  The sodas are also pretty expensive so make sure you are prepared to spend 10-15 on just a few glasses of coke if you order this.  Our bill went over $100 which is sad since 1/2 of the items we ordered were cooked wrong and even things we could not eat.    

It's been a few weeks since our visit here and I still have eater's remorse.  We wont come back to eat here ever again.  We're still on the hunt for a good Cajun place in Vegas--- *sighs*"}
{"text":"Grits?  I've never seen grits yet alone order it.  Sam, the waitress was very convincing.  Was very nice to have tried them.  Be back tomorrow for another sample."}
{"text":"A gem of a place.  The etoufee was delicious and peppery.  The cheesy grits with andouille ragu was rich and creamy.  The signature bread pudding was the best I've ever had.  The toasted garlic bread was light and crunchy, as to not overwhelm the rest of the meal.  Our server, Lisa, was informative and fun.  A great value and an unexpected treat compared to most Las Vegas eateries."}
{"text":"The red beans& rice with extra sausage was delicious.  Cooked just right!!! 

The Craw Puppies tasted like the frying oil needed to be changed. The inside of them was mushy or creamy. It was too dark to see if they were done. 

It was dark and hot in there.  I had to put something under the leg of my table to stop the extreme wobble. 

But it's a \"Dive\"!...... it was expected. (Smile)

I have recommended this place and will get my food to go in the warm season or come back during the day in the cooler season. 

I wish they had a full bar."}
{"text":"Got stomach cramps until I fell asleep and severe diarrhea starting at 5:00 am.  Had the oyster poboy with coleslaw.  Tasted great, but obviously something was contaminated.  Ate nothing else after that."}
{"text":"I was here with a party of 9 and despite waiting past our reservation we were accommodated and taken care of very nicely.

I hadn't heard of Lola's but apparently they're a big deal and have appeared on \"Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives\" for their roast beef po' boy. I was glad to try a local spot, away from the strip and downtown casinos. Lola's had a quaint, simple atmosphere that was very welcoming (and some TVs in case you need to catch the game). Our waitress was great, positive and seemed happy to be there.

I had a glass of chardonnay ($6) and it was pretty good. Some native Louisianans were super excited for Abita beer, of which they had many varieties. 

Bf & I split the Shrimp Étouffée and the Cafish Po' Boy with Fries and Potato Salad. The Étouffée was very tasty but could have been a little spicier. It was warm and comforting and filling though - exactly what I wanted. The catfish po' boy was a big surprise -- it was WAY better than I expected. The hoagie roll (apparently flown in from Louisiana) was amazing. So soft and fluffy and crispy. The remoulade was amazing too... I could have maybe just had that and bread and been satisfied. The fries were tasty, the potato salad was very \"meh\".

Everyone at the table seemed to love their food and had ordered a range of things from gumbo to bread pudding. All in all, an extremely welcome change from casino buffets. 

Now where can I get that bread?!"}
{"text":"Went there, before a show at the Smith Center.  It is right down the street.

Great atmosphere!! Jazzy blues all night. Very New Orleans.  

Tasty food! I had the Combo Platter. Love the fact that they use different breading for all of the seafood, accenting each bite. Crab cake had a sneaky kick to it, an enjoyable spice. Catfish was done just right. 

Bananas Foster was slightly burnt caramely goodness, with real vanilla bean ice cream.  Great way to top an excellent dinner!

I'm coming back to Lola's!"}
{"text":"I've always passed by this place driving down Charleston and always said to my self' I need to try that place out!' It was super busy on our way there since it was First Fridays, but we made it in time for our reservations, you do not necessarily have to make a reservation I just did not want to wait.It was very small inside and there were no seats available so we decided to sit outside. Since we came on a Friday night there was live music playing and it was awesome.We started with the crab artichoke dip which was really cheesy and creamy served with warm toasted bread.I ordered the Shrimp Creole and my date ordered the Jambalaya. The Shrimp Creole was spicy but a good amount of spice. The shrimp were juicy and plump with the tomato sauce and green and red bell peppers. I am very picky when it comes to Jambalaya, but I don't have anything bad to say about it from Lola's. It was not watery and it had a good ratio with sauce and rice. Believe it or not I ate my whole plate of Shrimp Creole. I saved room for dessert, and I chose to do the Bananas Foster. It was sweet and warm and so good. Also served with vanilla ice cream, it was to die for. I recommend this place to anyone who's been wanting to try it. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Heard great things from a local about Lola's...and headed there for lunch while I was in town. Had the gumbo appetizer...the roux was just the right consistency, but it was lacking \"jump\"...the flavors melted together, and there was not a whole lotta spice. There was nothing wrong, just not memorable. I opted for some char grilled oysters...the six were on the smaller side...again, nothing wrong with the dish, just not memorable....I finished with the jambalaya...the sausage, again, didn't bring heat...the flavor was more tomato than spice...I knew it was fresh as the onions were still crunchy in it...maybe if it sat a bit more it would absorb more spice...I don't know.  Service at the bar was friendly and on point...overall it was good, not great, and wouldn't cut it in the French Quarter."}
{"text":"https://www.ktnv.com/news/dirty-dining/dirty-dining-lolas-a-louisiana-kitchen

This is what happened on 5/14/18 outlining the 39 demerits C grade. I loved going to this restaurant and hate when management staff blows off the channel 13 reporter whois just doing her job. Shame on Lola's for not following simple food handling procedures."}
{"text":"This place kind of just fell into my lap while walking around our office building. This place has REALLY good food if you are into heavy, flavorful meals. My favorite to get here is the Jambalaya. SO GOOD. This location is a very small location, but worth standing in line for if you wanted to try it. It's constantly packed, so make sure you are okay with waiting for a spot."}
{"text":"Oh my god!! 
Wow this place was definitely found on google by accident. I am so happy for that accident. Everything on the menu sounds amazing. My friend and I ordered the following foods
For starters 
Hot Cajun wings - AHMAZING don't forget to ask for the house sauce trust me it's worth the extra $1
Fried soft shell crab - this was really good too definitely flavorful. You can tell the cornmill was laced with good old creole seasoning 

Entrees
Shrimp and Gouda Grits - never tried Gouda cheese before so I was little hesitant. So happy I tried it. It taste really good 
Catfish with red potatoes and green beans 
The catfish was definitely fresh; had that uber fresh taste to it
Red potatoes and green beans weren't good. The red potatoes were a little bland and the green beans were salty. We didn't eat them at all 
Jambalaya  Cup- this dish was so good I forgot about the additional veggies inside ( celery, onions, green peppers ). I don't eat those foods but I forgot all about that as I was eating it. 

Desert 
Banana Foster Bread Budding - there is no way something this good exist

The atmosphere is comfy."}
{"text":"Summary:  2-star food, with 1-star service.  I'm rounding up by giving them 2 stars.  Let's review this by separating the kitchen from the waitstaff.  Note to Lola:  You were at a wine tasting, and your staff does a horrible job when you are not there.  I'm sorry for the detailed review, but I'm hoping that Lola actually sees this and responds.  

Food:
Drinks:  Interesting beers in bottles.  Nothing on tap.  
Apps:  Crab/artichoke dip was good.  Crawfish puppies (hush puppy knock off) was not worth the money or the calories.  The salad is unimaginative and tasteless, but at least it wasn't brown lettuce.  
Entree:  a pound of crawfish, ordered medium, came out with the appetizers and was cold when we wanted to eat them.  They remade them for us, but it was so spicy and salty that it was impossible to enjoy.  The crawfish are pre-cooked, instead of being cooked to order, as told to us by our server.  They had blackened salmon on the menu and tons of po' boys, so I asked if they could make me a salmon po' boy...no dice.  Apparently, no one in the restaurant was willing to \"take the risk\" of changing the menu while Lola was out of the restaurant.  Anyway, the blackened salmon was well-cooked, but over-seasoned.  I like spicy, but you lose the flavor with this amount of blackening spice.  I asked for a side of sweet potato fries, but I can't tell you if they taste good or not (see the service comments).  Debris po' boy was all hype, and not up to DDD (curse you Guy Fieri).  The meat was good, but the gravy was cold.  The catfish po' boy was solid.  The soft shell crab po' boy was a nice sized chunk of crab, breaded and deep-fried.  Too much breading, too much bread, too much mayo.  

Total bill $150, and I'm going to make some food now that I'm home.  I'm hungry and irritated.  

Service:  
Ambiance:  We sat outside, so some things are harder to control, but the entire patio was blinded by the setting sun, but no employees did anything about it, even after we asked.  I had to go take one of the restaurant umbrellas from the side of the patio and position it to block the sun.  This helped enough tables that I received a large round of applause.  (We weren't the only table suffering.)  Flies all around our table too.  
Servers:  Our server had little knowledge of the menu, since she was a vegetarian.  Our water glasses were never filled until the end of the meal when someone asked for some...and she only filled that one glass.  The crawfish entree for one of our group came out with appetizers, with no response from the server.  She acknowledged that they shouldn't have come out so soon, but left them there and walked off.  They took my silverware away with my salad, so I had none for my piece of salmon.  I waved politely to get someone's attention, but one waitress in particular (Beth - blonde curly hair) looked right at me on three separate occasions and walked away.  (note:  Beth was not our waitress.)  They brought me the wrong side dish (no big deal) and made me sweet potato french fries (which the waitress had recommended).  And I had asked for a side of BBQ sauce, because it is the greatest condiment in the world...The waitress asked if I wanted the house-made signature BBQ sauce or the stuff they get from a bottle...duh.  5 minutes later, the fries were still pretty hot, and I reminded the waitress for the BBQ sauce.  So 15 minutes later the fries were warm, I asked a 3rd time for the BBQ sauce.  After 35 minutes, my fries were cold and I had given up on them entirely.  My GF asked the waitress \"what happened to the BBQ sauce?\" and she brought me out a tiny cup of it, and told me it was \"the junk from the bottle\" since it takes too long to make the house-made sauce.  Oddly enough, I didn't feel like eating it.  When it was time for our check, we gave them our credit cards and waited for 15 minutes.  When no one picked up the cards to process them, I walked them in and gave them to a waiter (again, not our own).  10 minutes later, as I came back from the restroom (filthy), I saw our check and walked over and asked a waiter (again, not ours) if anyone could please run the cards so we could leave.  Finally, the end of this mess."}
{"text":"I think one would be advised to make a reservation; though it's worth the wait if you don't.  jambalaya is spectabulous; wings are spectabulous; come to think of it, everything I've sampled here is spectabulous.  Story is that Lola relocated  from Louisiana during or after hurricane Katrina, and to our great benefit, remains in Vegas.  Another must visit whenever i'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The server was friendly and funny, which made for An enjoyable experience. The food was ok.  One person in our group ordered the catfish and it came out raw... when she brought it to the servers attention she immediately apologized and took it away but the entire table was caught off guard when the server brought back the same plate after the kitchen re-cooked the same piece of meat. ( i feel like restaurants usually bring out a fresh plate). Probably would not return but kinda glad I can say we tried it..."}
{"text":"Great food great prices phenomenal service! Would have been 5 stars if the wait wasn't so long :-(. Lola's should really invest in a larger venue in a better location. If you arent familiar with its current location it can be really hard to find.

Overall, this is probably the closest thing Las Vegas will get to downtown New Orleans food."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Lola's for a while now, always had great food and a great experience until last Saturday night. My wife and I decided on Lola's for our 25th anniversary. The food was fantastic, we started with a cup of Gumbo, followed with Crawfish Etouffe and Blacked Salmon, and finished with Chocolate cake. The service was good, even though the place was packed, with Lola serving many of our dishes herself. 

Did I mention the place was packed? Since I've been there last they appear to have doubled the number of tables, but not the size of the restaurant. I was literally inches away from the very loud parties next to me on either side. We could barely have a conversation. The food here is fantastic, but the atmosphere is declining rapidly, they either need to expand, or have fewer tables. If not I doubt that this will remain one of my favorites, maybe just for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This place was soo awesome Hubby and I enjoyed it here Angela our waitress was so awesome food was amazing just left you wanting more I had a shrimp po boy best food ever thank you we will be back"}
{"text":"Good service and food each time I have gone. I just can't understand why there is always more STEMS than greens"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I had the shrimp and grits and it was very greasy.  I also had the gumbo - and the same, greasy and not flavorful at all.  What was scary was one of the cooks had a full beard uncovered and working in the kitchen.  My friends did NOT enjoy their food as well.  This could not be the same the place on Dinners, Drive-In and Dives."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for dinner about three months ago. The food was good, not great. We shared the crawpuppies which were tasty but a little over-cooked. My wife got the bronzed catfish and grits. The grits were really good, but I didn't care for the catfish. I had the jambalaya which was fine, though the rice was a little mushy."}
{"text":"Lola's was excellent me and my friends discovered this little gem by accident and boy were we pleased . Good food and service reasonably priced"}
{"text":"This place is great!! We were tired of the typical Vegas restaurants and found Lola's. We love Louisiana/Cajun cuisine and this place fit the bill. The food was very, very good...great in fact! I had the blackened catfish and it was excellent. I had the red beans and rice as one of my sides and it was wonderful. We had the bread pudding for desert and it was spectacular. It's in the downtown area, so you have to get off the strip, but Lola's is worth the trip. Our server was very helpful and very sweet. If you're in the mood for Louisiana cooking, Lola's is the place!"}
{"text":"The place is small but cozy. Casual. The wait staff friendly. The food was off the hook. The Gumbo was tasty and good but had to add some hot sauce for my taste. The crawfish ettouffee was delicious. The shrimp and grits were so good. The grits were creamy & cheesy. The sauce they added had andouille sausage and was perfectly seasoned. The shrimp perfectly cooked. I would say the best shrimp and grits I've had. Prices were reasonable and the portion of food was good for my taste and appetite. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great for a family or buddies enjoying a bear, love the atmosphere and the food is amazing, saw this place on drive in dinners and dives, everything was perfect I'm surly going back this week, lolas= my new addiction"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with my husband and was seated right away. We did have a reservation and I'm glad because we occupied the last available table in doors. I had no idea how the service or food would be after reading so many mixed reviews. But our server Brittany was attentive had a smile on her face the whole time. I had the charbroiled oysters and the catfish platter with the grits and green beans. Both dishes came out piping hot and full of flavor. The grits were great but the green beans I wouldn't order again. My husband had a cup of gumbo, and the red beans and rice with extra sausage. He enjoyed  both dishes but didn't like so much of the okra in the gumbo. Overall everything was good and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Awesome Cajun dinner!  Service great, presentation wonderful and don't pass up the bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Lola's is worth the drive from wherever you are in Vegas. The atmosphere is fantastic, the food is the best Cajun in Nevada, the staff is excellent, ask for Shane! Have the orange bowl salad, the crawpuppies, the crabcakes, the bronzed catfish and grits, or the blackened catfish poboy!! You will leave happy and making plans to return! In the heart if the art district a fine dining restuarant like this is long overdue!"}
{"text":"Items Ordered:  Red Bean & Rice ($9.99), Bronzed Catfish & Grits ($16.99), Sausage Jambalaya ($15.99)

Total Bill:  Under $50

Level of Delight:  Very High

A little bit of Cajun delight in the city.  We were never expecting to find a little gem like this in Vegas. But then again we always happen to find the best little restaurants off the beaten path.

This is definitely worth the trip as you will get an authentic Cajun experience.  EVERYTHING we had was top notch but particularly special was the BRONZED catfish.  This was a first for us and it was delicious.  You probably can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu."}
{"text":"Every time  I visit Vegas I can't leave without a stop at Lola's. The food is always delicious and the drinks are good too. The service is quick and the restaurant is super clean. It's worth a trip off the strip."}
{"text":"I was so upset when my hubby brought me to this restaurant because i dislike Cajun food....i refused to eat it.  Up until coming into Lola's....This place is like heaven in your mouth.  I was literally blown away and I will def come back for \"craw-fish season\"!!!!"}
{"text":"Heavenly! Loved the food and the service was great! The jambalaya was flavorful as were the collard greens. Took the sweet potato pecan pie to go.  Wish o would have tasted it first, I would have bought a whole pie!  Very yummy!!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service food is awesome. Recommend marking a reservation due to the size of the place. True hidden gem"}
{"text":"Lola's is  definitely one of  my favorite places for Cajun/Creole Cuisine.  I ordered the Red Beans and Rice and Crawpuppies.  When I received my ordered I was speechless. By looking at my lunch you can tell how much love they put into my dish. My Red Beans and Rice appeared to be slowly cooked and  the  sausage grilled with a light char. The Craw puppies were evenly fried all around with a nice toasty color. I took my first bite of the Red Beans and Rice and WOW it was even more than I was expecting, flavors bursting out from everywhere. The Red Beans were so tender  they literally melted in my mouth .The  char on the sausage had a nice grilled flavor that compliments the beans in a wonderful way. The Crawpuppies were delicious as well, they   were crunchy on the outside,moist and soft on the inside with a delicious dipping sauce to dip them  in. My Coleslaw was fresh and crunchy and the Toasty bread they serve was tasty also. The service was also a big plus, as soon as you walk in they greet  you immediately, you automatically felt like part  of the family and they were also very attentive. Finally the bill came and it too was rewarding. Everything was reasonably priced,The service was attentive and the atmosphere felt  just like home. I will put this place on my list for many years to come, it was the best.

{"text":"This place is great! I wanted to check it out ever since I saw the place on Triple D. It is a small place and I recommend reservations. We were seated and looked over the menu's. I ordered the shrimp and grits.When it came out it looked so good! On the first bite, Awesome! The grits were buttery and smooth. The shrimp had the right amount of seasoning on them that it was easy to devour them and want more! My wife had the Blackend chicken sandwich and she really enjoyed that. The spices were really good. I really think this is one of the best places for shrimp and grits.
Loved that the owner made her way over to us to check on our meal and chat with us a bit. Our service and and the great food will guarantee our return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants and I bring out of town visitors here to give them something different outside of the Las Vegas strip. The food never disappoints and I everyone I have brought has loved it. I get the Roastbeef de'brees that was on diners drive ins and dive. It is delicious as well as the bread pudding that I Must order every time! Especially the seasonal apple bread pudding, don't forget the ice cream. Thank me later lol"}
{"text":"ITS SMALL. Make reservations if you want to eat inside! Luckily it was nice out so no problems. 

My gf had never had grits before so we came to this spot so she could taste some real grits. Not that everyday grits people eat. Food is amazing! But I kinda feel like we were kind of forgotten about since we were outside lol nonetheless will continue to come back. Reservations next time for sure"}
{"text":"Divine! Thank you Lola for a helluva meal. The service was wonderful. The food was even better than we expected. And the fig dessert -- Wow -- what a delicious ending to a true southern meal. We'll be back so thank you to the entire staff/family."}
{"text":"Outside of the French Quarter you're not going to find a more authentic creole place. I had the bronze catfish and grits and was blown away! Great spice, the grits were cooked perfectly....definitely check it out....maybe not at night as it's not in the safest of neighborhoods, but make reservations, it fills up quickly at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Wish I can give this place 10 stars.... Great food, great service, and not overpriced like most spots in Vegas. This food took me right back to Louisiana!

Definitely coming to Lola's every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food was very good... My family and I were on vacation from Miami and Ohio and I read about this location on Yelp. We all enjoyed our food and the service was good. It had a very nice New Orleans vibe."}
{"text":"Soft shell crab sandwich was awesome, along with their crawfish hush puppies. Tried their baked oysters too. Would come back to try the other seafood poboy sandwiches!"}
{"text":"We tried this place because it was a DDD destination. My husband tried the Po boy roast beef sandwich cause it was the featured item, he was not disappointed! Very delicious and the sweet potato fries were amazing. Our icing on the cake was the bread pudding! oMG!!! We highly recommend Lola's!!"}
{"text":"I decided to NOT get the gumbo since that's my usual dish but our very friendly waitress asked if we wanted to start with anything, maybe a cup of gumbo...so of course I ordered the cup! It was one of the best cups of gumbo I've ever had...even compared to New Orleans gumbo!!!

For my main dish, I got the shrimp and grits...another winner. The sausage \"gravy\" surrounding the grits was delicious...I finished before my friend was 1/2 way through his meal! 

And since we hadn't gotten one bad dish...dessert had to be ordered. I had the bread pudding...great texture, warm and sweet. My friend had the banana pudding...also a great dish!! 

We both agreed that this is a spot to come back to the next time we're in Vegas. 

One last (important) thing to add...it was not pricey!!! ...one more...The staff was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"It's worthwhile to get off the strip and find a local spot at which to dine. Lola's was a great experience, small and cosy on the inside. It was a busy night, so we had to remind the waitstaff to bring out the garlic bread basket we ordered. The food was wonderful- I had the shrimp and grits, great flavors throughout. Sadly, we had no room for dessert. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"A must visit.  I was referred by my mother-in-law, I went again,and now I'm saying to go yourself.  A true hole in the wsll, but WOW!!!  Great Cajun food"}
{"text":"I ordered the Gumbo and the famous bread pudding. All orders come with complementary bread.

I ordered the Gumbo spicy, and it was moderately spicy. For $13.00, they really skimped on the chicken and whatever else was in it. The Oyster House definitely has a better gumbo, and they make each one from scratch. Only problem is you'll probably wait three plus hours. 

The Famous Banana pudding saves the day. They make a toffee sauce that consists of a Jimmy Bean reduction. It was absolutely out of this world! In the viewers opinion, it is the best bread pudding he has eaten that dates this review. Outstanding.

Verdict: skip the Gumbo, order another dish. It's absolutely mandatory you order the bread pudding though!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in New Orleans, I'm very apprehensive about eating Creole food anywhere outside of the 504 ... it almost never tastes authentic to me.  Except at this place!!  The chargrilled oysters are as good as any I've ever had back home, and the bananas Foster bread pudding is a perfect marriage of my two favorite desserts.  Definitely worth the detour from the Strip.  I also love the Saints and Mardi Gras memorabilia all over the walls."}
{"text":"Lola's. Finally. You've been on my To Eat list for so long and I'm very glad you came thru for me. I was skeptical after sitting (wait standing)  for 15 minutes waiting to be seated watching everyone run around a little scatterbrained and confused. However the smell coming from the food all around me told me to be patient. Glad I listened to my nose. 
We were seated outside and our waitress was sweet but overworked and not 100% attentive. You're probably wondering why I gave this place 4 stars. 
A couple of reasons. 
Firstly and mainly- the food. 
Everything was good. The wings (level 10 is like a level 5 of Thai spice) for sure made with a homemade Louisiana style sauce. 
Crab cake- yum. 
Fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken was for sure from scratch and had a hit of Cajun flare. 
Shrimp Charlotte, angel hair with light sauce, mushrooms and shrimp. Spicy and a tad dry but the flavor & a squeeze of a lemon made up for it. 
Secondly- their effort. Scatterbrained or not, everyone there was truly busting their butts! I can't wait to return for some gumbo and catfish. 
Oh and also make a reservation- this place is packed for a reason."}
{"text":"Good food, tasty  NOT NOLA level but it'll work! Rather pricy for the portions.. but good."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this place on a whim last night and boy am i glad we did. This little hole in the wall on Charleston is a gem and was even featured on Diners, Drive-in's and Dives! My aunt, who is not at all a fan of grits, lit up after the first bite saying Lola's grits' is fantastic and the best she's ever had (and she's from Oaklahoma). 

They also have a pretty good wine list which was a nice nice surprise as i didn't see any indication that they served alcohol on here or their site. 

If you like Cajun food, you need to go here!"}
{"text":"If this is what Cajun is all about, sign me up! Craw puppies and a Catfish Po-Boy with coleslaw were my delectable dishes and OHMYGODIWANTMORENOW. Sorry. Nola's is enough of a reason to want to come to Vegas. Extremely flavorful, crispy, and delicious all around. I don't know what the problem is with the haters. Don't like the service? Get take out, people. It's not rocket science. The place is seriously jumpin' on a Friday night and the live jive/blues music just makes the experience complete."}
{"text":"Here right now visiting from FRISCO so me and my Bestie stop by to check out the joint since it was on Triple D. We had the deep fried catfish and the shrimp with da gouda grits and OMG, stop da traffic!!! I mean creamy, gouda smooth to the last spoon grits on deck.  I'm a southern girl so I know what all of this is suppose to taste like and lola's has nailed it."}

{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, good value. Chicken strips were light and crunchy, crab cake spicy. We loved it!"}
{"text":"Oh my, Oh my!  Lola's is great.  When I walked in I felt like I was in New Orleans.  The music was playing and the beads were hanging along with a cool Saints Jersey. They only serve beer and wine which was fine.   My friend and I ordered Shrimp and Grits and Catfish and Grits.  They were great but in my opinion I needed more Grits.  It was AWESOME.  Hot and creamy Grits.  yuum!  Also I finished with the Sweet Potato Pecan Pie with a scoop of Butter Pecan Ice Cream.  Need I say more?  The place is small and quaint but that added to the charm.  Make a reservation if you come after 4:00p  Gets very crowded.  Enjoy!!!  The waitress was oh so awesome as well in suggestions and descriptions."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem for sure! Service was great and the food was AMAZING! I had the fried oysters and they were cooked perfectly! I am upset because I didn't know about this place sooner but I thank my coworkers for introducing it to me! Are you looking for some southern comfort food that is out of this world? Then you need to hurry and try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was welcomed right away as soon as we entered. We waited for our friends at the bar. The female bar tender was also very friendly.  The food was delicious.  Had the crawfish etouffe. I think, if served with dirty rice it would've been even better. The grits with shrimps was really good. Bread was also pretty good. Save room for banana pudding and bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We were in a hurry but we were so happy we found it. The food came quickly and looked great, but unfortunately we didn't have time to stay. They got us boxes and our check right away and were so kind to us even though we had to leave. The food ended up being delicious! The atmosphere was great and we will definitely be going back to enjoy it when we have more time."}
{"text":"Last week when I was in Vegas, a co-worker took me and a client to Lola's for dinner.  The place was completely packed on a Wednesday night.  We sat at the bar and received excellent service (this is really fun; waitresses take great care of you!).  This was a big meal.  We started with cajun hot wings and crawpuppies, both were very good.  The ceasar salad was also perfect.  When it came to the main course, Shrimp, blackened catfish & grits.  Words cant describe how awesome this dish is.  I ate every bite!  The superbe waitress even talked us into ordering dessert.  The bananas foster bread pudding was so good.  I think I can honestly say, this was the tastiest & most complete meal I've ever had.  I've been thinking & talking about this meal for days now."}
{"text":"I love Lola's.  It is one of my fave restaurants and my go to, before Smith Center dinner spot.  Shrimp and Grits are one of my favorite foods and will always order it when on a menu.  Lola's Shrimp and Grits are amazing.  The Gouda Grits are what does it for me.  They are to die for, as in order an extra side to go cause your are gonna be craving them later or in my case forever.  I also get the Catfish and Grits once in awhile to switch it up.  All the desserts are delicious.  Service is always wonderful.  Never have any issues there.  Everyone is very friendly, multiple staff members checking on us.  We are always taken care of.  Def try to make reservations, it's a small spot and gets full quickly.  I have called on my way before and they were able to get us in.  There is also a small bar, I have sat there a few times, outdoor seating or you can get takeout.  So really no excuse not to come try Lola's."}
{"text":"Out and about looking for a quick bite for lunch and we saw Lola's.  It is in a unique area of town, not out of the way.  Totally within walking distance to the downtown hotels and the premium outlet mall.  The restaurant is tiny but don't let that stop you from eating here.  Parking was easy.  The waitress was happy and really nice.  I had the Shrimp Charlotte and they happily substituted chicken for the shrimp for my wife.  Both were spicy but not over the top.  The garlic bread was tasty. The prices are totally reasonable too!   We will be back to try the shrimp and grits as the table next to us said it was amazing."}
{"text":"It's no wonder this place got a C rating from the health department not too long ago. I went here sometime last year with my boyfriend. When we got back home, I started to have severe pain in my stomach. I fell to the floor crying in the fetal position (yes, it was that bad). On a scale of 1 to 10, the pain was at a 10. My boyfriend started to have stomach pain shortly after mine began. It was not as bad as mine, but it was definitely uncomfortable. What a terrible night that was. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"A friend from out of town was visiting and wanted to go here after seeing it on Food Network.  I had never heard of it but thought it would be a different place to try.  

I'm not big on cajon but I enjoyed it and he seemed very happy with his meal.  I had the blackened chicken and the spices were just right.  

The wine was good too.  Service was also very good.

I would definately return."}
{"text":"Yum! Always come here and order the gumbo and crab cake!
Today I decided on the Roast Beef Debris, for one.. its profiled on DDD this month.. its a bit different from all of the Gulf seafood offerings. It was tasty but the gravy on top appeared to be like gravy in a jar. I have never tasted it, but that's what it sure looked like.. gelatin like. 
Sweet potato fries were great! 
I was here the week before and loved the gumbo as usual and the peel and eat shrimp. It would be nice if they were deveined, did it myself. 
Have never been disappointed with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"How small and great is this place the number of customers will tell you!
Crazy busy and delicious food. My first time eating Luisiana kitchen! Very pleasant atmosphere! Take a bar seat, the funniest place in the house!"}
{"text":"YUMMY! I've only been here once so far but it definitely hits the spot if you're craving some NOLA flavor. I ordered a fried chicken poboy (don't worry, I asked them to hold the calories)  and my husband ordered a catfish poboy. We also ordered charbroiled oysters which were very small and didn't compare to what you can get in NOLA, decent but nothing special (I'm not gonna lie I would still get them again--I was just let down that they weren't exactly what I was dreaming of).

The poboys were both tasty but they could have both used a bigger portion of meat.

My husband was obsessed with the desert. I think what we ordered was called banana foster pudding.

You should probably stop reading reviews and just go there because this is the best NOLA food you'll find in Vegas! If I'm wrong please tell me because I love me some NOLA food.

Oh ya---the place is pretty small inside so you may want to make a reservation.

WOULD I GO AGAIN? DUH! Take me with you?"}
{"text":"We love this place. We are from the south so to have great southern food is awesome. The owner is from New Orleans. The food and service is awesome. Portions are large. It is a very small place so weekend nights probably best to make reservations. Inside and outside seating."}
{"text":"We wanted to give this place a try, as we had seen it on triple d, and we love Creole food. We drove out from the strip ( only a couple of miles ) and had a late lunch here. It is a little place in a small strip mall, but the food is very good. The service was quick and friendly. We tried the grilled oysters for an appetizer, which were pretty good, but not quite up to the Acme Oyster House in Louisiana.The crawfish ettoffee was very good and not overly spicy. Some places haven't figured out that the key to good Creole food is the flavor of the spice, not the quantity. The fried seafood platter was good, not great. It was a little greasy, but overall was OK. For this type of food to find its way into Las Vegas, is a great change of pace to the overpriced, over hyped places in this town. If you want something different that doesn't break the bank, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Catfish & Grits and Abita beer. Wow! I love red beans and rice but wasn't impressed too much with theirs, it was a little bland. I will try again. The grilled oysters was very good as well."}
{"text":"A taste of LA in NV, awesome. The place was was packed at 12:30 for lunch but we were seated quickly.  

Started with the craw puppies and hot crab & artichoke dishes. As I'm not a huge fan of hush puppies the craw puppies were head and shoulders above the norm. Very good, moist and seasoned just right. Enough of a crunch, but not overly hard. The crab and artichoke dip along with their special bread they fly in daily from New Orleans was creamy, hot and spiced perfectly. 

For our lunch entries we had the fried shrimp and fried oyster po' boys with sides of sweet potato fries and red beans and rice.   Angela,our server, was nice enough to mention that the po' boy could be split between half shrimp and have oysters.  The shrimp can be ordered blackened, bronzed, fried or grilled.  I went with the traditional fried. The sandwiches came \"fully dressed\" (lettuce, tomato & mayo).  The oysters and shrimp were perfectly fried. Crunchy, seasoned and NOT oily or soft. Spot on. Our sides were up to par as well. 

All in all a great near downtown eatery to have a business lunch and grab a taste of the South. 

As a side note, I had the same luck with the quality of their food and service at their new location on Town Center."}
{"text":"It makes me really sad when I see the one and two star reviews on here because this isn't the experience we had at all. 

I had never heard of this place before and just happened to see it as we drove by on the way to Frankie's Tiki room. Lucky us!! It was about 5pm on a Friday afternoon and there were a few tables open, but we like to sit at the bar and eat. Right away, a really nice guy came to us and asked us where we were from and told us about the menu and the food we were considering.  (I'm mad at myself for not getting his name. I usually do) After we ordered, he talked to us for a while- really nice fellow.

We ordered the Gumbo, Shrimp and Smoked Gouda Grits, and Crabcake Entree. All were awesome and I was especially in love with the grits. Being from the South, I've had my share of grits and I can honestly say these were the best I've ever had, no lie. For desert we ordered this amazing \"pie\" I don't remember what it was called but the bottom part was cherries in a red wine reduction sauce topped with homemade cheesecake. Oh Lord it was good!!!   During our experience, Lola herself came to the bar and talked to us for a while and told us about how she came to be in Las Vegas and how the restaurant came about. She was really nice and was asking how we liked the food. Very nice gal. I wish her and her restaurant the best and we will DEFINITELY be going back on our next trip to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Back again and Lola's still very good.  Had to have that Oyster Poor Boy again and it's a winner.  Make Lola's a must stop on each visit.

Don't forget to pin your City on the map in the hall way at the back, if it's not already done."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a Yankee, but I've been to New Orleans two dozen times and have a great appreciation for the cuisine.  So when my brother, a Vegas resident, raved about Lola's, I made him take me.  Twice.

First visit was a Sunday, and we learned when we arrived that they feature a Saints gameday brunch.  Everything you'd expect from a proper Southern brunch, and we each left approximately five pounds heavier.  (This was also the Sunday that the Browns inexplicably beat the Saints, so we were careful to hide that particular Yankee affiliation.)

Second visit was weekday lunchtime.  I had the jambalaya with shrimp, the bro had the shrimp & grits, we split the crawpuppies appetizer, and all were fantastic.

The food alone would be reason to return, but part of what makes Lola's work is the service - very Southern in the sense that they treat you like family immediately, right down to the good-natured ribbing.  When Lola talked us into the bread pudding dessert, another server passed by, smiled, and said, \"Did you tell them what they're going to order?\"  That kind of thing.  The bread pudding is absolutely dynamite, by the way - save room for it, if you can.

It's a bit off the beaten path, but certainly worth cab fare from your hotel.  Lola's will be a regular stop for me every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I must apologize for the words I placed here regarding the owner, let's just say that we witnessed un-pleansantries with servers and customers.  But the food is great, and I know there's a 2nd location opening in N. Town Center Dr.  

Hubby and I had the chicken wings (sooooo darn tasty, borderline salty, but real good... stuff I think I'd crave if I'm pregnant ;), the bronzed catfish was UHmazing, melt in your mouth spiced goodness with equally scrumptious cheesy grits and a mushroom sauce.  I was so happy to have found a place that had charbroiled oysters (not raw, not baked, but a good in-between prep) topped with butter, lemon and a little cheese. If the oysters were larger, it would've been perfect.  And since it was my very first time to try gumbo (yes, it was), I can't really say if theirs was good.  But if they did serve a typical gumbo, I just don't think I'm a gumbo gal.  

The place has a good selection of beer and wine, but I was desperately craving vodka or a light cocktail.  Wine just fills me up too fast when I'm already having a heavy meal.  The crowd also significantly thinned by 8 and 9pm.  Maybe they wanted something substantial to wash away the heavy goodness... or the disagreeable service.  Go to Lola's in a cheerful mood with cheerful friends, or order the food to go."}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing shrimp and the best remoulade sauce in the world!:)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was annoying. Never got asked if we wanted another drink and no refills on iced tea. Waitress greeted us at the door with attitude but hostess was extremely nice and found us a table. Would be five except for our waitress. #whodat"}
{"text":"Oh my god good. Take the short trip north off Las Vegas Boulevard you will be pleasantly surprised and will return like I will also."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, since we are from Louisiana, and we know how to appreciate good seafood. Food tastes like it is cooked at home, with love. Staff and customers are always friendly. Customers happy to be in a Louisiana environment. Lola is a doll! Friendly and energetic and wants to please her customers."}
{"text":"I always have high expectations for any place that serves \"Cajun\", \"Southern\" or \"Louisiana\" cuisine. 

We had an impromptu dinner here on a Tuesday night. No reservations but it was no problem. The hostess seated us immediately. I loved the decor. Reminded me of a true Decatur or Burbon street restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. It felt so genuine to talk and laugh with our waitress and hostess. It's like they knew us and we were friends over for dinner. 

We ordered the gumbo and char grilled oysters and I gotta say.... they kind of missed the mark with both. While both were good, the oysters were small and overcooked. They were seasoned perfectly but cooked so long that they literally would not come out of the shell. The gumbo was more of a seafood gravy with rice. Definitely too thick to be a gumbo. It did have a good flavor though. 

We also ordered the hot wings (not pictured. They tasted like they were just drowned in hot sauce. Seriously just hot for no reason. I love spicy food but when something is so spicy that you can't enjoy it... it's kind of pointless.

Lastly, we ordered the pecan sweet potato pie. It was... interesting. It sounds much better together than it tasted. 

Overall the food wasn't bad. It just wasn't authentic. And that's ok because we're in Las Vegas, not Louisiana. So nice try. But no. Not quite there with the few items we tried. 

But would I come back? Sure."}
{"text":"First time trying the Louisiana cuisine!! Beyond amazing! I love spicy seafood so this place was heaven for me, we had cat fish and grits, shrimp creole and crab cake and gumbo for appetizer I strongly recommend to try these two before your main dish!!!! I didn't want to miss these two typical Louisiana food but they had in small portion its location is a bit odd but I guess people know this place is good you see people keep walking in and out"}
{"text":"Food is superb and tastes exactly like New Orleans.  It almost feels like once you sit down in Lola's, you are in New Orleans.  The music and the food is authentic!  The Shrimp and Grits is a must have!!!"}
{"text":"I don't think I spend enough time at Lola's. I've never had a bad meal. 

This location is crowded. Parking is tough. 

I tend to order the shrimp and grits. You truly can't go wrong with that. I've always had the shrimp po boy. But, I don't think I would order that, again.

I'll keep coming back, and hopefully, I'll start trying the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was definitely filled with southern comfort. I only had the red beans and rice and half of the banana foster bread pudding as I wasn't that hungry but my hubby really wanted to try out this restaurant! All I can say is I left upset with my tummy that it couldn't make more room for more food! I will absolutely be coming back, pictures to come from my next visit!"}
{"text":"Right now is the perfect time to show support for fantastic, original, food in Las Vegas.
The city is redoing the freeway and surrounding streets. As a result, getting in to Lola's is a nightmare. On a Saturday night, at 8pm, there were five couples and one family. In the past I have waited with a crowd to get a table--the food was, and IS, worth the effort.
For those who don't know, Lola's is New Orleans transplanted on to Charleston Blvd., Las Vegas. Everytime I get the craving, I have two choices: hop a flight to NOLA, or run over to Lola's. 80% of the time, Lola's tides me over.
The other 20% of the time...well, that can get pricey."}
{"text":"Great foot, fast service, what's not to like here. Great New Orleans style food. Not a big place but big portions and great food. If you're in Las Vegas, give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food are grate but the space is too small, not five stats cause they asked us to move to the bare side after we already sites in a table :("}
{"text":"Ordered an appetizer, it was brought out without any plates, so we asked the food runner to bring some, and she acknowledged our request (which obviously we should not have had to do in the first place). After five minutes of waiting and our food getting cold, I finally flagged down our server. We choose to ask for it to be removed from the order as we did not care to eat cold food. The overall service was quite slow. The food we ate was good, but not 4-star worthy. I guess it's my age, but I can't tolerate poor or lackluster service, and I hope others don't either."}
{"text":"We went to the new Summerlin location on Town Center. The crab cake appetizer was OK- it had unnecessary extra mayonnaise spread on top. Our entrees were delicious! Loved the shrimp and Gouda grits. However, the service was terrible! We hardly ever saw our waiter. No one ever cleared our appetizer plates, even after they delivered our entrees! The server just moved our empty appetizer plates to the side to place our entrees and walked away."}
{"text":"I'm from Nola and this was weak. We ordered crawfish puppies and they were pasty inside. My husband ordered soft shell crab poboy and the batter in the crabs was crazy thick and flavorless, plus they didn't clean out the crabs, yuck. I ordered grilled oysters and they did not properly shuck them from the shell. we also tried the lump blue crab cake and there was no lump about it. SAD experience for me. plusthe server ignored my feedback. If you are familiar with true southern food, cook it yourself."}
{"text":"Great time was had by all. We will be back . The Gumbo was good . The fried oyster's are good sized and done just right. Shrimp Charlotte was a nice plate

Was a fun place only has beer and wine, Wish there was a foll bar at this location"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I come here. I just love the food. I sometimes order 3 separate meals and wash it down with booze. It's my home away from home."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice.  The staff was friendly and the the service was excellent.  Unfortunately the food was nothing like the staff or service.  I ordered five different items off the menu- red beans and rice, craw puppies, roast beef po boy sandwich, gumbo and collard greens.  Red beans and rice had no flavor, they tasted like they came out of a can.  Craw puppies were mushy but had good flavor.  Roast beef sandwich was not bad, however the gravy had the texture of canned gravy and was extremely salty.  Gumbo had no flavor and consisted mostly of rice.  The collard greens were sour tasting.  I have to say the best part of my meal was the beer I drank (Abita).  Sorry Lola but I was not impressed......
One other thing- the presentation of our food was NOTHING like the pictures posted on this site."}
{"text":"Just got back from Mardi Gras in New Orleans earlier this month and was looking for a cajun food fix. I had read the good reviews of this place prior to my trip but put off trying them out since I was heading to heart of all things cajun. So, after having some down right amazing food in New Orleans and then eating at Lola's in Vegas, I must say they did not disappoint! We ordered a few items including the blackened catfish and crawfish of course. If you've never had crawfish, your waitress will be glad to demonstrate to you how it's done!

The location itself is a hole-in-the-wall joint for sure, sitting right next to the I-15 in an old plaza. There are limited seats so if you're there the weekend there may be a wait. We came at dinner time and sat outside at a cute little table next to some string lights to set the mood. Very cute ambiance, great for a date night.

Will def be going back to try some po-boys!"}
{"text":"Lola's is a really nice place. Although it's small the food definitely made up for it. Everyone in our group enjoyed the food so much that we are planning on coming another night."}
{"text":"This simple, New Orleans style place is filled with delicious food. The softshell crab &  the gouda grits with shrimp, OMG!!! The banana cream pudding is awesome!! MUST TRY THIS HIDDEN TREASURE!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Oh. My. Gosh it was amazing. Amazing is an understatement. Total Louisiana feel, atmosphere, and taste. We had the roman trio as an appetizer, it's not on the menu but it's red beans and rice, crawfish and gumbo. Then the beef debris poboy and BBQ shrimp with the grits instead of rice. No joke. So delicious. I could eat it every day. And the prices are spot on!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their crawfish although it might not be for everyone since it's on the spicy side. I don't believe they're as flexible as some other crawfish places since they didn't ask if we wanted it spicy or mild. Our waitress recommended the strawberry lager and it was light and refreshing. Perfect pairing for the crawfish. The catfish with grits was absolutely delicious. I didn't think I'd like grits that much."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Cajun and Creole food and having eaten at many of the fine and casual restaurants of this genre in Louisiana and Las Vegas (many Louisiana expats. in Vegas bring their cuisine to Vegas), and furthermore being a fan of any effort to invigorate and revitalize downtown Las Vegas, I gave Lola's a try based on some pretty good reviews from friends and family.  

Friends and family had noted that Lola's best items were in things like the Jambalaya, craw puppies, Etoufee and things like Po' Boys were nothing too remarkable.

Knowing this, for lunch, I shared the craw puppies with a friend, and had the Jambalaya.  Crawpuppies were ok, but unfortunately didn't stand out too much for me.

Jambalaya was not quite as good as I had hoped - it was a bit soggy/mushy/overly moist and undercooked and was a bit clumpy as opposed to the rice grains standing on their own, and didn't have this nice crust some Jamabalaya comes with from the well cooked rice (a hallmark of Paella as well).  Had to add quite a bit of seasoning to the Jambalaya as well, as it was underseasoned in my assessment.

I really hope Lola's can make it happen at this location.  Based on other reviews here of Lola's which are generally pretty good, perhaps my experience is unusual, and I will likely try Lola's again to give it another chance.  This is a great location, particularly with the RTC, County Government Center, City Hall, UMC/Hospitals/Medical Offices, Arts District, UNLV Shadow Lane Campus and many courts and law offices in the area - and a mid level good restaurant should do well.  Past history at this location (Bistro Divino, the deli - both pretty good) did not yield success - I hope Lola's can turn this around."}
{"text":"YUM! YUM! YUM!

I tried the combo plate with cheesy grits and green beans, plus crab puppies. ALL DELISH! I will go again and recommend!"}
{"text":"When I saw shrimp and grits on the menu, I knew I had to try Lola's. I was a little disappointed  when I arrived to discover the dish was denoted as \"spicy\".  I'm not a spice lover so I opted for catfish and grits; I thoroughly enjoyed it. The crab and artichoke dip was spectacular too. For dessert we wanted to try something out of the ordinary for Las Vegas so we went for the sweet potato pecan pie. It was awesome too.  You won't be sorry you ate at Lola's."}
{"text":"I found this place after watching an episode of DDD and I'm so happy I caught this episode!  First of all I've been looking for a great Cajun style restaurant in the Las Vegas area, and have never had any luck finding it. Until Lola's!  The place is actually a bit small, but if you're not there during the lunch rush or anything it's totally fine.  I've never had a dish I didn't like there.  Their po' boys are delish!  Their Cajun style fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken is to die for!  Service is always been nice. Met the owner once and she was a sweetheart.  Oh, and their bread pudding was phenomenal!  Always a pleasure going to eat there!!!"}
{"text":"With all the talk about great Cajun food in Vegas, and the stellar reviews Lola's has received, I really couldn't wait to try Lola's food. I should have set my expectations lower. 

My man and I walked in on a random Tuesday night to a fully packed house. The 2 servers looked a bit overwhelmed but ushered us to a table (I was glad I had made a reservation!) and gave us some menus. As I looked around the restaurant, my excitement only grew. Lola's certainly makes you feel like you're at someone's kitchen in New Orleans. Several New Orleans photos hang on the walls, and a Saints flag is on display at the front of the restaurant. And, while the colorful umbrellas hanging from the pipes were a bit kitch, they were cute kitch. 

Unfortunately, it was the food that disappointed. First, bread caked with butter (I'm assuming garlic bread but we were not sure) came out to the table. It was almost inedible. Thankfully, the charbroiled oysters came out next, and they were delish. Soon to follow were the crawfish puppies (they taste a lot like conch fritters), which were also pretty good. Finally, what should have been the star of the show, the bronzed catfish served over grits, came out. As I dug into my first bite of the grits, any excitement I had for eating grits in Vegas went out the door... the grits were stone cold. I mean, super duper cold. When I asked my server if grits were supposed to be served cold, she said no and promptly took our plate back to the kitchen. I assumed that she was going to have the chef remake the plate and send it back (as we had like 4 bites total of the fish). Instead, they had simply removed the old grits, plopped new (potentially microwaved) grits on the plate, and reserved the same plate! Unfortunately, the fish got cold because it took about 5 minutes to bring the plate back! And, any stock on the plate had now disappeared because they had scooped it all out when getting rid of the old grits so that the food became extremely dry. 

All in all, a lackluster meal with lackluster service. What a shame....."}
{"text":"We almost dined at Lola's last year during our trip. I had read the rave reviews on Yelp and wanted to try some Louisiana food so I could compare it to what I'm used to as I lived in New Orleans for over 10 years. But as you're driving from the outlet mall towards Lola's, it's hard to tell if they are even open. This time we decided to take our chances and drive over there. The parking lot is actually on the side of the building and difficult to see from the street. I'm so glad we made it to Lola's! We started out with the tasty crab and artichoke dip served with garlic bread. I have to give a shout out to the bread also. It was delicious. We also had the Cajun wings which were good but not overwhelmingly so. For my entrée, I had the bronzed shrimp and grits. One reason I decided to try this dish is because the shrimp is served over gouda grits. An andouille sausage and mushroom ragout is drizzled around the outside of the dish. I really enjoyed this entrée. The only thing is that the next time I will have the ragout omitted. Everyone else said the sauce was fine but it wasn't my preference. The customer service is A+. Thanks to our waitress for answering our numerous questions and making suggestions on how to \"customize\" some of our entrees. We enjoyed Lola's so much that my friends insisted we come again two days later. Our second visit to Lola's was on the last day of our trip. This time I had a half fried shrimp and half fried oyster po-boy with a side of gouda grits and coleslaw. Everything was great. No complaints from any of us. Definitely add Lola's to your list of must try Las Vegas restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing locals only food. Brings you back to Louisiana. Pretty much everything here is great. Just be warned, the spicy dishes are really spicy! Pay attention to the menu, it warns you."}
{"text":"Kind of hard to find (sketchy area if you pass your turn) but small and quaint.  Delicious food and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Always ask the locals where they eat. Always ask former locals where they eat now they're not near their hometown digs. Case in point: I asked my work pal who is a Cajun transplant where he goes to scratch his itch for New Orleans cuisine. Without a hitch, he said: \"Lola's!\" I said: \"All right, all right, all right!\"

Getting here is kind of tricky. The best method from the freeway is to take the I15 Northbound and exit the Charleston exit south and dive into the first driveway opening on the right and find the first parking spot available. The next best ways are to approach on Charleston from west to hit that driveway or take Grand Central Pkwy going north to south and drive straight into the driveway to the parking lot. You cannot make a left facing west to get in to the parking lot.

Accommodations included indoor and patio dining. Indoor dining is small space that has a sports bar feel with wide screens on the walls. We should have made reservations but the waitress was very cool and gave us a seat right away. Decor all over is NoLA fun and party ready.

We went family style eating off each other's orders and requested of the kitchen the Char-Broiled Oysters, Bronzed Shrimp & Grits, Jambalaya-Chicken & Sausage with extra sausage, and Fettuccine Alfredo with blackened shrimp. Let's start with the oysters. First, I do not like oysters in general. These I will eat. About grits, I am not a fan of grits either. To use my dinner friend's phrase: \"The grits were a revelation.\" They were very creamy and went well with the shrimp and other food on our plates. Other highlights included the table favorite jambalaya (everything on that was perfect) and blackened shrimp fettuccine (nothing too oily nor overcooked; the pasta was fresh, al dente tasty and shrimp followed suit). No missteps here. The clean, orderly presentation was a great touch.

What's my bottom line? My friend was right. This is the best place to get your down home  Louisiana fix at. Great food, quaint atmosphere, sports game on the widescreen, southern hospitality in a western state. The experience made a limited Cajun skeptic like me into a NoLA cuisine believer. I've got to get the red beans and rice next time. My work friend swears by them. My actual rating is a solid 4.6 stars..."}
{"text":"Good food but the service is very poor. My drink was never refilled and nobody came by to see if i needed anything. I only saw the waitress when I ordered and then again with the bill. The extremely busy bus person brought my food. I wanted to have coffee and dessert but I wasn't going to wait another hour for that. It's a shame because the food is very good."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  We are not from Vegas but come here often so we had heard about Lolas. Also had seen the episode of Diners, Drive in's, and Dives so I was excited to finally eat here. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. 
I ordered the crawpuppies and the most popular item on the menu..(per the waitress) the shrimp and grits. The crawfish hush puppies were ok. You could taste the crawfish and they were hot and fresh so that was good.  I was underwhelmed by the shrimp and grits. I have had this dish at different restaurants and I have to say that Lola's version was not the best. It wasnt bad, I just expected more flavor.  The grits were hot and creamy, which was good. But the actual shrimp mixture lacked flavor in my opinion.
My hubby had the jambalaya and he said it was just ok.
The service was good and all of the food was fresh and hot. I guess i just expected more because of the hype.  I wouldn't eat here again but it was nice to mark off of my food bucket list."}
{"text":"The best cajun food in town. We were there a coupke nite ago and i have to admit they took my breath away. My server Trina was so amazing. I would give Trina 10 stars if i could. Thanks for everything"}
{"text":"I think New Orleans was moved to downtown.  We had a great time at dinner last night. The food was to die for. Lola's is the real deal when it comes to authentic Cajun cuisine. If your heading there for dinner on the weekend make sure to call ahead to make a reservation as they are always packed."}
{"text":"Lola's brings New Orleans mouth watering cuisine to Vegas. This hole in the wall place isn't the easiest  location to find but once you walked thru the front doors it's your own piece of THE BIG EASY to enjoy.

I kept it simple and started off with a crab cake appetizer  and then had Red Beans & Rice... Gotta say this place was amazing. Came back the following week with a friend and again more love for this joint.

So if you wanna savor the flavor hit Lola's because she won't disappoint ya."}
{"text":"Best creole in Vegas.  It took me back to New Orleans. I wanted to slam a hurricane when I was done feasting on the jumbalia and shrimp. Mmm. Small place always busy but plenty of room. A little pricey."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I get to partake in chicken wings that are as spicy as I like. Lola's has those wings, yes they did! They even gave me a side of ghost pepper sauce that I used like ketchup. The wings were nice and juicy with plenty of meat and I exchanged my fries for a side salad. 

My friend got chicken and sausage jambalaya which was also tasty! (I tried it...I always do) It was perfectly spicy, not too much for his sensitive tongue. 

For desert we ordered the bread pudding which was covered in a caramel sauce and topped with homemade whip cream. The pudding was hot when brought to our table and melted in your mouth like buttah. I wanted to take this with me to go but since someone else paid I had to at least pretend to be a lady and not a bread pudding addict...which I may be after that. 

Service was friendly. Always attentive and smiling. 

The menu is mostly seafood, which means unfortunately I couldn't eat a lot of what was on it. However, the Cajun flavors were abundant in everything we ordered and received. Recommended!"}
{"text":"The last review I made for Lola's a few years ago was laced with Strawberry Abita beer and a touch of homesick lol. However, I'll confirm that I still love Lola's and I find myself craving the (highly recommended) Catfish and Shrimp Grits. Love her desserts too. Looking forward to trying out her new location in Summerlin."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I almost don't want to tell you how good it is, because it is already too busy! But that is too selfish, so I will let you in on this local secret spot that is AMAZING!!!

First piece of advice- make a reservation. This place is hopping!

We started with crab cake and craw puppies (hush puppies made with crawfish) - YUM! I  had shrimp and grits, so good! The service was perfect! We even had a visit from the smiling owner. Nice touch. 

I wish we had saved room for dessert! Next time"}
{"text":"Lola's is a great place.  

Great food and great service.  What more can you say.

I had a wonderful Sizzlin Ham PoBoy and my friend had the classic Oyster PoBoy, we then shared a super delicious bread pudding with a wonderfully decadent chantilly sauce.  

Great place for some good old fashioned New Orleans cuisine.  All that's missing is the bayou..."}
{"text":"It's this great little hole in the wall, A Louisiana Creole-Cajun style restaurant. The staff was very nice and helpful.

As seasoned amateur foodies we like to each order different plates so we can share and try a few things at once.

My wife and I started off with an appetizer, the \"Craw Puppies.\"
Sorry we didn't read the ingredients, but they were very good.
They had the perfect amount of heat, flavor and seasoning. As my wife put it, \"the dipping sauce was like WOW! you could have licked the dipping bowl clean it was so good.\" LOL!  And I totally scraped all I could from it. :-)

Up second was the \"Roast Beef Debris Po-Boy\" Sandwich as seen on \"Diners, Drive-in's and Dives\"

Man this Po-Boy was one of the best roast beef sandwiches we've ever had-hands down. It had just the perfect amount of beef gravy and it did not make the bread soggy. The bread crust was flakey and had a nice medium crunch to it.
The beef was tender, the red onions added the right amount of flavoring to it. A must try for sure!

3rd on the list was the \"Shrimp Po-Boy Blackened\"
Using the same bread, this sandwich had real Cajun flavors in every bite. The blackened seasoning was again WOW! Spectacular! We loved this sandwich and if and when we return to Vegas we will no doubt get this as a go to sandwich.

Finally dessert. We decided on the \"Bread Pudding.\"
This had small chunks of walnuts and raisins with a home made sweet sauce covering it, topped off with whipped cream.
This was very good, not soft and soggy, but firm enough to cut with your fork and not have to eat with a spoon. LOL!

But the home made sauce was what really put this dessert over the top. At first we couldn't figure it out, then it hit me, so I asked the waiter if the sauce had any Jack Daniels in it? Smiling , all he would say was that \"it has some booze in it.\" 
He wasn't willing to give away the secret sauce info. LOL!

All in all, we really loved this place and would definitely go back in a heart beat. And the prices are very reasonable for Louisiana Creole-Cajun style cooking.

{"text":"Went to Lola's today for a business lunch.  I was excited to return - I'd come by when they were in their first couple of months of operation for dinner and had a wonderful time.  Today was not so hot. The food was excellent - the service? boooooooooooooooo.

We were there for lunch and it was clearly busy.  But we didn't see a waiter or waitress for nearly 20 minutes after being seated.  No drinks, no menus, no nothing.  I finally saw a guy at the other end of the cozy dining room and raised my hand to get his attention.  He actually looked up, waved at me, rolled his eyes and proceeded to continue laying out silverware as if we didn't exist.  Is he related to someone there?  Only reason I can think of to have such a bad attitude at the front of the house representing your business. 

A few minutes later the (manager? co-owner?) came by and finally asked to take our drink orders.  I let him know about the fact that his staff had ignored us.  (eyeroll was still laying out silverware at the end of the dining room, so was easy to point out).  No apology and no acknowledgment from that guy either.  Fish rots from the head down i guess.  

Fortunately, our server Emi came in and the meal went well from there.  The service was adequate but slow. Unfortunately, i won't be returning here or hosting any other business lunches here.  Poor service trumps good food every time."}
{"text":"This place is great when you can get in so reservations should be something you seriously consider. Variety is nice but its hard ot go into specifics since I pirated my way through everyone's plate and I kinda didnt know what I was trying half the time. Place was packed, later lunchish in time. I ate here a long time ago before their remodel and its changed quite a bit, and I mean in more ways than wallpaper. Still definitely better than your run of the mill stuff but honestly I miss the care and focus that was put on each and every recipe, some was bland some was overcooked some was just fine but when I go to Lola's and pay Lola's prices I hope to get more than just \"fine\".  And its not even close to intimate inside so if you want some room to breath you should ask for a patio seat that has a fantastic view of our beautiful 15 freeway. I agree its tiny and I wouldnt bring kids here not because staff isnt as accommodating as they can possibly be but because there just isnt room for them. All that said its still a great place"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem! I haven't had food this great authentic since I was in New Orleans. You must try the shrimp and grits. Red beans and rice are delicious. Gumbo is so good but a little spicy, so worth it! The Caesar salad is delicious I'd recommend you grab one as a side. Oh and all of their desserts are worth trying! Service was also amazing and the ambiance is great for more intimate meals! I love this place"}
{"text":"Me and my family was in Las Vegas for Mothers Day and just had to try this restaurant! That was one of the best decisions we made while in Vegas I would definitely love to visit this restaurant again ! I definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Quick Look: best Cajun cooking I have had outside of NOLA. Hec, it would hold it's own against the food at I had the more well known restaurants in NOLA itself! It's that good!! 

In Depth Review: I have been driving by this little restaurant tucked away in the old Holsum Bread Bakery on Charleston Ave and wanting to check it out since it opened 5 years ago. This past Thursday (7/17/14), I had the chance to go after a shopping trip across the street at the Premium Outlets with my wife. We got there at 8pm and the sign in the window switched to \"closed\" as we were walking up. The same sign said: \"open til 9pm,\"  so we went in and took our chances. Restaurant was full and we were greeted by the GM named Hank at the entrance. Hank was friendly, said he would get us sat and that they switch to closed at 8pm sharp as that is the last seating time. So arrive early folks or you may not be seated to eat. This small but cozy place was full on a Thursday night. Seating is very limited, so I advise a reservation in advance (especially on the weekend). 

I was thirsty. Hank suggested a Louisiana micro brewery that they carry named Abita. Never had it and went with their Amber beer. It was chilled and was quite possibly the best beer I have had in a long time. Have since went to Total Wine & Liquor here in Vegas and filled my fridge with it. Try it, you can thank me later. 

Hank knew we were very hungry and that it was our first time visiting Lola's, he was kind enough to bring over a nice sampler of three of their best selling items. This was a nice touch and it solidified what we would eventually order as our entrees. He introduced us to our waitress and she was very knowledgeable of the dishes and made made good suggestions, including the crab-cake appetizer. We each ordered one and they were AMAZING! This is real crab, they are fresh, massive and not the frozen \"Krab\" cakes that many high-end restaurants try to pass off as \"authentic\" in Vegas. 

For our entrees we ordered the Catfish and Gouda Cheese Grits and Shrimp and Gouda Cheese Grits. The dishes were large and plentiful. The dishes were love at first bite. These Gouda Cheese Grits are a divine experience. Every bite was full of flavor. I inhaled my Shrimp and Gouda Cheese Grits and literally used the soft garlic bread to wipe the plate clean of any remaining evidence, I mean sauce. Both plates are a MUST try! 

We took some of Lola's special \"bread pudding\" home with us to eat later as we were both very full after eating our entrees. The bread pudding was also a divine experience that you must have if you visit. So good!!! 

Hank checked on us as we were finished and was kind enough to introduce us to the owner, Lola. We spoke to her and she was very kind and welcoming. She was happy that we had finally stopped in and invited us to come back and be part of the \"family.\" I felt her words were legit and that she truly meant that. Good to see an owner be a gracious host and talk to the tables and guests. She touched every table and said goodbye to everyone. Could tell many guests were her regulars as she knew them by first name. What hospitality, you just don't see this in Vegas these days! 

Overall: I cannot wait to go back. I have already told dozens of people about my experience at Lola's last Thursday. Lola, Hank and the entire \"family\" at Lola's will welcome you with open arms. Just call ahead first and make that reservation, space is limited and it will fill up. 

We are lucky to have a place like Lola's in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Cajun food I've ever had. I'd thought I'd had some tasty craw fish in Houston, Lola's dominates them all.  Will eat here again, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Best Creole/Cajun food in Nevada! Order the  Bronzed Catfish & Grits All the goodness of the deep South! Seasoned and pan bronzed. Mississippi catfish served over Gouda grits with an andouille sausage and mushroom ragout."}
{"text":"I wish I could have given this place more than three stars.  Having lived in the big easy and having Deanies in bucktown, Drago's in Metairie as my baseline, it's kind of hard to expect anything less.  We ordered a bunch of stuff to share and some of the stuff was right on point.  Others needed a little tweaking.  The red beans and rice, and the crab cakes were good.  The fried oysters were a little overdone but still ok. The charbroiled oysters were ok but could have done with a little garlic.  The bbq shrimp needed more work.  The shrimp itself was good but the sauce was way too salty and tart.  The service was great, they really took care of us and for that I am grateful. I will be back when I come into town again."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  We originally went in for some crawfish- (my husband was feeling adventurous)- come to find out their is a season for crawfish. Guess we will have to come back for the crawfish boil.  : P

We loved our food!!!  I had the gumbo-- wow. Flavorful, full of goodness with a hint of spice. My husband had the Bronzed Shrimp-  amazing. Spicy, thyme-y (is that a word?),  wonderful. 

I ordered the Gouda grits but they never came.  Our server remembered halfway through the meal however at that point I was full and didn't want them. She was kind enough to bring me a sample. Cheesy goodness!!!  

Definitely will keep Lola's on our list of places to go when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I Love this place (Downtown Location) but unless i get a table with some arm room its not a pleasant experience. On my last visit we were so close to the other tables that it was hard getting in and out of my seat but even more of a distraction is sitting so close to other patrons that I could not eat without our elbow use planning. Our conversation were all on top of each other and one table was so close to the front door everyone who opened the door walked right into a table while people were trying to eat. I love the food, hate the space you get cramped into. I can't go back, it way too small of a area when you try to mash up as many people as possible in such a small area. It may even be unsafe."}
{"text":"I keep adding to my list of places to eat in Las Vegas so we don't end up with boring, overpriced, mediocre meals. Thanks to Yelpers, we found Lola's and couldn't be happier. Our lunch was outstanding. 

Two of our crew had been to New Orleans a while back and still yearn for the food there. Their happy memories were revived at Lola's. Gumbo, po' boys, red beans and rice, sweet potato fries, regular fries, a beer, and the marvelous bread pudding with bananas Foster -- fantastic. Our waitress Angela couldn't have been nicer. 

Some website said the beef roast for a beef debris sandwich should be cooked until a hard stare makes it fall apart. This meat was as tender and tasty as ever anyone could wish. We look forward to exploring the menu further!"}
{"text":"Best New Orlean/Cajun restaurant in Vegas, better than Emeril's and alot more fun.

Lola is an actual person, she is regularly there, so she is very detail about her craft.

There food is great, I love the cat fish, the bread is awesome and simple.....

The crawfish is very fresh and is only serve on certain days....

There shrimp is always fresh and juicy....

Lola is known for the po boy sandwich...."}
{"text":"On our list of must try places in Las Vegas & as seen on triple D, this was our first stop after a 6hr drive (due to unexpected traffic) from SoCal. Made reservations (recommended) and were seated within 10 mins. WONDERFUL hostess! Waitress was was great too. Everyone was professional and friendly. 
Recommended: 
Deep Fried Soft Shell Crabs meal (3 crabs with 2 sides $19.99).
Char Grilled Oysters
Blackened shrimp & grits
Sweet potato fries
Grilled chicken breast (very moist and flavorful) with white rice."}
{"text":"Hard to find using gps but worth the frustration....we had jambalaya plus shrimp, crawfish etouffe and New Orleans coleslaw.  All was delicious and the spiciness was just right.  Best meal I've had in Las Vegas in a long time."}
{"text":"MJ & I,  had.. Etouffee, Jambalaya, Beans and rice with Crab cakes...hot & spicy with Wrought Iron lager....good stuff !"}
{"text":"Best Shrimp & grits on the planet!
Grits have Gouda cheese. Shrimp are blackened and so juicy!
Service was very good.
I will 100% return.

If I was at home, I would have licked the bowl clean!"}
{"text":"Very small & cramped restaurant with old rickety chairs and tables. More of a dive mom & pop shop. The tables are so close together!! So close you can see everyone else's food which didn't look appetizing either. Service was terrible, this is the second time I was talked into eating here and for a second time I was not impressed, & I'm a local Las Vegan who eats out a lot!! The food is very salty! The first time I came I had the gumbo, I expected to be \"wow'd\" and wasn't even close. Just because something is spicy doesn't mean it has great flavor. I have had better gumbo at the airport in Denver!! This second visit I had the soft shell crab Po Boy, that sandwich was so salty!! And for $15 NOT worth it for such a tiny restaurant that rushes everyone.  Go to Streetcar Po Boys for New Orleans style cuisine & you won't be disappointed! As a local I won't be coming back.  Seriously, did Lola's pay people for all the 5 star reviews!! Don't go there, seriously!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but I went there for lunch today.  It was the second time I have eaten at Lola's.  The food is okay, but nothing rave about and the prices are so so.  We arrived at 11 am as they opened so the place was empty.  I'm a quick eater, as were the other two I was with, so we finished quickly.  We finished our meals, and we didn't get a refill on our drinks.  It didn't take long to understand why they didn't give us refills on our drink.  The place had filled up in 40 minutes.  It wasn't long before someone (I presume it must have been Lola, but not sure since this person didn't identify herself to us) approached us and asked us if we wanted a refill.  I told her I didn't, but one of my coworkers said they would like half a glass.  We were told there were others waiting outside for a table, so we got the message that we weren't welcome anymore.  My coworker told her never mind, and then she offered a to go cup.  

We weren't \"hogging\" a table, but were made to feel that we weren't welcome.  Needless to say this is the last time we will eat at Lola's because their management does not respect their customers.  I have never been made to feel so  unwelcomed in a restaurant as I was made to feel at Lola's.  Just say no to this place.  Too expensive for what you get and they don't appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"Went here with some classmates. I loved this place and I'm not big on seafood. Be sure to make a reservation because it is tiny and it fills up quick! The food was exquisite. I had the Bronzed Gouda Grits. Definitely a new dish for me and I was sure happy I did because I think I found my new favourite dish and I even ate the shrimp! The fig delight is amazing even if it was little to sweet for my liking. The servers were sweet and they came back to give us a refills and check on us every few minutes and even provided us with answers to our many questions. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday dinner last night. It was pretty good I must say... tried the chicken & shrimp gumbo which I felt could have tasted a bit better. I really liked the shrimp jambalaya.. it had a really good spicy kick to it! For dessert I had the banana fosters bread pudding which was AMAZINGGGG. I liked the atmosphere inside the little restaurant as well... it is small, and kind of hard to get to but it's homey & comfy. I heard the Summerlin location is a lot bigger, so they have more options but this place was cute."}
{"text":"I went to Lola's while I was on a business trip in Vegas.  Bottom line, very mediocre compared to most cajun restaurants in Southern Louisiana.  I had the blackened chicken with vegetables and my  colleagues had the catfish.  The concept is nice, but the food definitely not indicative of what makes SoLA or New Orleans famous.  Just doesn't have the sophistication of culinary artistry or taste that I expected.  Keep on trying, though."}
{"text":"Suprisingly pleased with this spot.  As a southerner, 2 hours from LA, I have higher expectations of cajun food than others.  E.g Hot & Juicy would be slightly above average compared to what you can get in the South when looking at quality and price.  But everything is relative to where you live, so this place really stands out for cajun/louisina food.

 I ordered the Crawfish Etoufee and cup of Gumbo.  The Etoufee was well seasoned and spiced.  I liked the bread they served with the Etoufee to mop up all the juice.  The gumbo could have used a little more kick.  

Next time I'll be sure to try the charbroiled oysters, soft shell crab, bronzed catfish n grits, and the new orleans style bbq shrimp.

Please bring BBQ crabs - they are so  damm good!"}
{"text":"Always try to come here when we're in Las Vegas! The food was a little spicy for my party, but I thought it was good. And it's 5 minutes away from our hotel and the North Premium Outlet Mall!"}
{"text":"Love the Nola food, the authentic and delicious flavor of this kitchen is unique In Las Vegas, had the Shrimp and grits so delightful, the bread pudding outstanding, is a carnival of flavors melting in your mouth, the service is not that great, waitress get lost for long time, you can see them chatting with hostess and have to wave many times in order to get their attention, I have been here tree times the soft shell crab is so crispy and delicious, the jambalaya, the gumbo so much layers of flavor, once again, you come for the food not for the service. But the food is so great, I'll be back as many times I'm craving New Orleans Food."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with a buddy. The vibe is really nice.  Service was snappy but it seemed to take a while for our po'boy sandwiches to come out from the kitchen. I had the roast beef debrees. It was super tasty and the fries were perfect. Cooked long enough but not too long and perfectly seasoned. 

I highly recommend this place. Very good food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Food is just awesome. I've never had Louisiana-styled food but I'm pretty sure that this place does it how it's supposed to be. It brings memories of my mum's home cooking, she didn't cook in that style but their food feels like it has love and that it is made home-style. 

Service has always been awesome when we've been there. My partner and I order the crab cake for an appetizer and share it. It's yummy, spicy but we love spicy. We then order the grits with catfish, gumbo and shrimp creole, all plates are perfect. We share them because we want to taste all the great cooking they do. 

We come here as a treat. Price and quality are well balanced in my opinion too which means it's affordable and worth it. 

Thanks team for serving great food."}
{"text":"So I finally got to try this place after hearing so much about it. When we arrived it was not busy so we got seated right away. As starters we had their Cajun wings w/ fries and their gumbo. Wings were good but the gumbo was delicious. Then for out entree we had the shrimp & grits and the BBQ shrimp. The BBQ shrimp was okay honestly I wouldn't get it again. But the shrimp and grits, that was really tasty. Their grits had lots of flavor and so did their shrimp. To finish our lunch we had the famous bred pudding. Omg it was so good! Hahaha can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Real New Orleans poboys bread? Must try next time I'll come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Lola's A Louisana Kitchen!! ! Wow! Why haven't I tried you sooner than this?! Located right off Charleston and the I/15 you will find this hidden gem of a restaurant. I get random invites all the time from clients on these business lunches and I sometimes run out of places to think of to go eat on the spur of the moment. Today was different though I have been craving some Cajun style southern cuisine dishes and thought hmm why not check off this Lola's in my \"bookmark\" section on Yelp!

For starters when you are traveling to this restaurant for the first time pay close attention because it's super easy to drive right past. Look for this small turn in of an entry to the Holsum Bread bakery and Lola's will be right next door. Upon arriving it was to my surprise that they weren't as busy as I had anticipated especially around lunch time! Seated right away?! Score! Our server was awesome and super attentive to us the entire time we were there. I can always appreciate great customer service at restaurants when they make recommendations knowing it's my first visit. 

Lunch was as followed:

Drinks: 2 \"Muddy Waters\" Pretty much Lemonade & Iced Tea

Appetizer: Crab Cake- Lump blue crab, hand-formed with special seasonings. Served on a bed of mixed greens drizzled with a lemon garlic aioli sauce.

Blackened Chicken- Served with two sides (country potato salad/Mardi Gras Coleslaw)

Bronzed Catfish & Grits- Seasoned and bronzed catfish served over Gouda grits with an Andouille sausage & mushroom ragout.

Food total is going to be a 4 out of 5. The crab cake appetizer was so-so I do believe there was too much bread or something in it that took away the crab taste. My client is from the south and knows much about crab cakes and agreed. Overall though, this place definitely didn't disappoint and will return very soon. I was informed on this visit that they also have a Summerlin location which for me would be so much more convenient!"}
{"text":"This was best dinner I've had in a long time. I couldn't decide between the cajun wings or the crawfish hush puppies as an appetizer. I went with the hush puppies as they are something you can't get anywhere else. They were awesome. I also had the catfish and Gouda grits. Yes Gouda grits. They were amazing!!!!  Don't even try any other cajun restaurant in the area, this one was the absolute best!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was by far one of the best meals I've had in quite a while. I ordered the Soft-Shell Crab Po' Boy and my girlfriend had the BBQ Shrimp. Both were really tasty and a good portion. Despite being full already we decided to go Full-Tilt and order Dessert. We shared the Banana's Foster Bread Pudding and the Sweet Potato Pecan Pie. \"Wow\" would be the perfect description for both of these items! Do yourself a favor and stop by this hidden gem of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back to Vegas just to come back here. The shrimp and grits and the catfish and grits were amazing!!  Will def be back here!"}
{"text":"Lola's did not disappoint! Staff were polite, atmosphere/music is spot on and the most important thing the food was yummy! I'm going to try and change up my recipe and maybe have a few friends over."}
{"text":"Came to Lola's after seeing it had been on #DinersDriveinsandDives. The location is across the street from the show I am working this week so it was convenient. Had the Gumbo, Gouda Grits with Mushroom Ragout just sides since the portions looked huge and I wanted to indulge in dessert! 

1. The place is packed, they accommodated me even though I didn't have a reservation. I was a party of one but, the place was standing room only and they didn't give me a hard time. 

2. Very glad I did the starter and side, skipping the entree. Food is OFF THE HOOK, very rich and Very filling. Gumbo was spicy but, not so hot that you couldn't enjoy it. Heat scale 7. 

3. OMG Banana Foster Bread Pudding!! Took the managers suggestion since everything was enticing. I wish my hubby was with me enough to share. 
      Picture this: A 3\" square slab of bread pudding,       
topped with a large scoop of vanilla bean ice cream that has been brûléed to encapsulate it. Absolute perfection. Finish with a housemate brown sugar caramel sauce. 

4. Call the paramedics to help you through the coma. 

Prices are excellent for the quality. Service was great. Vibe is great for a party."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Cajan restaurants. Everything on the menu is amazing. I always drop by when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Never coming back!

The employees are really weird here. They just stare at you and are generally awkward. I thought it was just me but others have commented on this. In addition to being weird they aren't friendly. They will try to not give you bread on your order and fill your food up halfway. I bought banana pudding and it was so close to halfway full that I took it back. There's no way I'm paying all that for a half of a container. The main dishes are never filled when you order to go. I don't know how it is ordering in because I never wanted to sit and eat with the creeps who work there. 

I'm not coming back for the mediocre food, weird people and stingy portions. I even had an employee come out and tell me that I couldn't park in the red. If I'm in the car I'm stopped not parked. When I was in the restaurant you didn't say thanks or anything but now you can come out to tell me to move? Are there police around or are you just being a pain? I wasn't parked there for a long time and I was really upset. 

The food is terrible! The jambalaya tastes like tomatoes with pepper. They give you such a tiny portion you need something else to go with it. The beans and rice are bad, there's no real seasoning to them. They are stingy with the sausages in all the dishes I've tried. The banana pudding is good but not great. 

I'm pretty sure I can find better Cajun food with much better customer service!"}
{"text":"We came in at about 8pm and it was fairly busy but they got us seated quickly. They sat us on the patio but it was in a weird spot behind one of the building pillars and 2 feet away from everyone walking in/out, which was kind of disappointing. For whatever reason, it took over 10 minutes for someone to come over to us after we sat. Two waitresses were walking around serving the other tables just next to us but didn't even take our drink order.

My wife doesn't eat seafood so she went with fettuccine alfredo with chicken ($14) and I got the shrimp and grits. The fettuccine was really tasty, a lot more flavor than most pasta-focused places and the chicken was delicious. It was slightly crispy on the outside and moist inside. Her plate was a pretty large portion but the shrimp and grits seemed really small for $17. Either way, it was killer! The Ghouda grits are some of the best grits I've ever had...really creamy and taste amazing with the spiciness from the rest of the plate. There are 5 decent size shrimp on top which were plump and juicy. We also went with the bananas foster for dessert which was good but a little pricey at $8.

Overall, the food is really good and by itself easily deserves 4 stars...5 if it wasn't overpriced. The service was nothing special but it could have just been a bad night. We will come back, especially when crawfish seasons comes around again!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant.  Never had a bad meal and the service is great.  Be sure to ask for Lisa`s table."}
{"text":"Blackened catfish poboy! Nom nom!!!!!  I could have done without the craw puppies though. 

Very attentive service!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after it being recommended by a few friends. We went for lunch. Figure out directions before you get there. Very easy to miss the turn off. Tiny place with an outside patio. They say the noise is moderate, I think it's a bit louder than that. Now to the food.....We shared a crab cake, the hot crab and artichoke dip, and I had a 'po boy. half shrimp-half oysters. I loved all of the items! Crab cake had subtle heat, not too bad at all. Crab and Artichoke dip came out very warm and was served with grilled bread from New Orleans. Almost ordered another round. The 'po boy was just sensational. Fried shrimp and Oysters were perfectly fried and not even a bit greasy. (They don't have the combo on the menu but were happy to provide it when I asked.) Seating is very cramped, you will get to know your seated neighbors well if you wanted to or not. lol. I can't wait to go back to try more of the menu items."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant about 4 times. The food is pretty good, but the staff is horrendous. Each time we've been there, we've had to wait around for someone to get our order. Waited too long for refills. The icing on the cake was an argumentative waiter regarding the bill. I'm happy to pay for what we ordered. I will not pay for things that were not ordered. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Great Cajuns food!  The beef po boys are huge and delicious.  My wife had catfish and grits.  She's into grits!  They did not disappoint.  I have also had the blacked chicken.  My favorite. 
We go to the one on Charleston. Fun for groups too. No one will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was great!. But I felt service could have been more personable. Like offering suggestions when asked what are your favorite dishes? Felt a little rushed to place my order."}
{"text":"Lola's was fantastic. My mom and I dined there before a show at The Smith Center. I made a reservation online ahead of time, even though we got there a little early they sat us right away. Living in New Orleans for 3 years, Lola's took me back. The ambiance is just like a NOLA restaurant. My mom and I shared the crab cake dinner and a shrimp po' boy. That was the best po' boy I have had outside of New Orleans. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The prices are also very reasonable. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tiny.  Busy.  Fantastic.

Lola's is a gem.  Call ahead and make reservations or you may be sorry.  The place is already packed by 5:00 PM on Fridays and Saturdays.  

If you're looking for something different, don't hesitate to give Lola's a try."}
{"text":"We had friends and family in town this week and following First Friday Art Crawl, they wanted to come to Lola's for dinner. We were very thrilled with the customer care when we got a call from Erin to let us know prior to our 7 pm reservation that a number of customers had late arrivals due to traffic resulting from a local accident. It worked for us to have extra time to enjoy the galleries and then reach the restaurant at 7:30. We were very happy to get a table for six on their patio, as weather was perfect. You know how I feel about the generally tight space in the middle of the restaurant, so the open space and superior care we got from Lisa made this a fantastic night!
We all shared jambalaya, gumbo, catfish, crab cakes, really good pinot noir and our favorite Tenaya Creek pilsener, shrimp, and they delivered hot and good! Desserts were pecan sweet potato pie and the chocolate cake with ice cream.
We won't wait another two years before making our way back."}
{"text":"High my so amazing service was great and the food was to die for. One of those places you want to go back to try something different every time we got four dishes and did the family style thing. We tried the blackened catfish with grits,the crab cakes, Shrimp Charlotte, and the crab and artichoke dip. We loved it all. My son took a bite of the catfish it was a little to spicy for the waitress was so nice she brought him a glass milk.EVerything was amazing.MY family will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Creole comfort food at its finest.  Great ambiance, portion size is great, cost is appropriate and flavor is plenty!  Will definitely make a return!"}
{"text":"Very cool little cajun place. They were featured on DDD. The cajun chicken sandwich is very good. Its not too salty or spice or too much cayenne. Its perfect amount of spice. The gumbo is delicious. They also have a roast sandwich which was picked as ddd favorite. You have to try it. Everything seems to work. If your looking for cajun food with that southern charm this is the place. They are a smaller restaurant but everything seems to work. On nice days in vegas you can sit outside and enjoy the traffic and food."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great Cajun food.
**I'm not going to leave a three page essay on what I liked and did not like about this place. No one cares. If I gave it one or two stars then I'd give an explanation.**"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous lunch here today! Started with the char-broiled oysters..then ordered the shrimp and grits... just WOW! Husband had the jambalaya...also amazing! Fabulous birthday lunch and perfect service from Lisa! Thank you Lola's!"}
{"text":"Service: the restaurant was so tiny and yet so busy! We did have to wait about 5 minutes to sit at a table to eat. After being seated we were promptly greeted by our server who was sweet and friendly. She was able to answer questions with confidence and was so nice even though she was very busy with several other tables. I even watched her show the table next to us how to get the meat out of the crawfish they ordered. All people working there were so nice!

Food: yeah.. I will being going back.. Over and over... I ordered a crab cake to start, it was delicious and not too spicy! For lunch my daughter and I ordered the catfish, they were so kind to cut it into strips before frying it because the sever knew we were going to share it. The food was fresh and delicious! Sweet potato fries?!? Yes please! Dessert was equally amazing with the bread pudding. It was simply delicious! The sauce was not too sweet and the pudding was not too dense, it was all in all a spot on place to eat."}
{"text":"Ate here twice in the last 6 months, were from out of town. Food was flavorful and reminded us of our stay in New Orleans so a total plus. 

Grits were amazing and the pasta was to die for. If you willing to wander off the strip or from Fremont you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nope. We won't be back. 

Let me start by saying the service was great. Our server was a sweetheart. So, there is that. 

But right away we were disappointed when  the hostess told us there were no available seats within the restaurant. It was empty. But I guess there was some kind of event going on. Yet, all the attendees of the event were milling about outside. The entire time we were there, we never saw them go in and sit. This means we could have sat inside. 

We were not happy about sitting outside. West Charleston is right there and full of traffic. Annoying. Not to mention we were seated right on the curb so cars pulling into the restaurant were a mere arms length away. I just don't find sitting in the street with traffic a great ambiance for dinner. 

The food was just ok. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip as an appetizer and I thought it was very good. For dinner I ordered the blackened salmon, green beans and grits. I was not impressed with the beans. They were slimy and tasteless. The grits were fantastic. They were the highlight of my meal. The salmon? Ugh. I'm a salmon junkie. I love salmon. I'll eat it cooked (or not) in any fashion. I eat it at least once a week. This was, hands down, the worst salmon I've ever had. The outside was covered in some kind of spicy seasoning. That would have been fine but the inside? No flavor at all. Zero. With all the spicy seasoning on the outside, there is no reason my taste buds should have been searching out for flavor. But they were. 

My husband had the jambalaya. He said it was good but then he said it would be hard to mess up jambalaya. He said it didn't taste any different than any other place he has had it. It was good, but nothing special. 

Even though they messed up the salmon--like seriously just terrible salmon--the gouda grits and the great service would have had me back for a second try--if not for the crappy location."}
{"text":"I was invited to dinner here with a friend of mine. It was not easy to find, but once you realize where it is, it's easy enough. The place is quite small but quaint, had good energy. I was greeted at our table right away since I came in a few minutes after my friend. I order moscato and shrimp and grits. My friend already had a Belgium beer and he ordered the crawfish Ettouffee. The food arrived fairly quick for a very busy restaurant. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Their garlic bread was awesome, and my shrimp and grits were by far the best I've ever had. I've had it at 2 other Cajun restaurants and they were mediocre. The seasoning was perfect for my taste. It was plenty of food, unfortunately I did not have room to finish it all. And no room for dessert! Their desserts looked amazing! It's been two days and I am already craving to go back. If you go to the Downtown location, best to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Lolas- popped over here right before we saw American Idiot at the Smiths Center.

Okay first GRITS are 5 stars, best grits I ever had. Service was awesome for us. 

Im giving Lolas 3 stars because besides the grits I thought the food was okay. I got the fried catfish platter with two sides. My sides were grits and red beans and rice. 

Catfish was moist and friend nicely. Red beans and rice was good too but neither was something I was wowed about. HOWEVER need i say GRITS again? GRITS GRITS GRITS. If i had only had that 5 stars. marriage proposals the whole 9 yards. 

I could not try the other food my friend got because Im allergic to shrimp (bummer I know- and I was not born with the allergy either it developed over time, major bummer because I used to eat shrimp a lot, now they are just tasty morsels that if i ingest will probably kill me) awesome. I will say she LOVED her dish and it was gone all too fast. So the bbq shrimp and grits a go go go go must have.

Lolas- eat the grits and move on to dessert all the options looked so good."}
{"text":"So good! Went with a friend on our lunch break, fast service and the food was awesome. Only thing lacking was the drinks menu, Minute Maid lemonade in any legit restaurant is not okay, ESPECIALLY a southern one! Hopefully they get a better beverage selection eventually, but I'll def be back for to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Yelp is the best.....we went here based on the reviews in Yelp. This is one of the bestest ever dining experiences we've had in Vegas.

We love Cajun food...and I am a big fan of Po' Boy's .....

First - I didn't see anything on the menu that I wouldn't love to eat!. I ended up having the fried oyster po' boy....it was great!!!  

We will be back...and hopefully it will be sooner rather than later....mmmmm"}
{"text":"A great little restaurant. A little hard to find for a tourist not familiar with the streets, but well worth the effort. My wife and I went there twice in our 5 night stay in the Sin City. The best Cajun/Creole restaurant we have eaten at outside of New Orleans.

We had 2 different waitresses on our 2 visits. Both were very friendly and fast. The great garlic bread they serve starts the meal off well. Had a nice burnt touch. The gumbo is fantastic - rich, flavorful, full of ingredients. We had the gumbo on both visits. The entrees we tried over the 2 visits were the bronzed shrimp and grits, the jambalaya, and Mama's red beans and rice. All were rich, flavorful, and satisfying. We actually ordered a take-out serving of the jambalaya to take home to California.

The bread pudding that topped off our 1st visit was excellent. We were too stuffed on our 2nd visit to order dessert. 

Definitely a place we will visit if we wander back to Vegas. Much more satisfying and cheaper and worth value than any buffet on the strip."}
{"text":"We can't wait to go  back!!! We really felt like we were in New Orleans and the place was PACKED on a Friday night. If you can't handle spicy spicy, they will be happy to lessen the spice in the rue for you. 

PROS: Shrimp & creamy gouda cheese grits
             Catfish & creamy gouda cheese grits
             Orange bowl salad 
             Sweet tea
             Festive atmosphere
             Grilled garlic bread

CONS: None yet."}
{"text":"Not that great. Food was ok but not superb based on the reviews. Broil oysters was overpriced for $24.99 dozen! Total bill for 8 was over $200."}
{"text":"Had the combo shrimp and oyster poor boy.  It was excellent.  For Desert it was bread pudding and another great choice.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Their shrimp and grits are amazing!  The artichoke crab dip with grilled bread is fantastic and the grilled oysters are a MUST.  Service is fantastic, and they are always so accommodating when we come here with a large group of at least 10-12 people.  It's a small restaurant off the beaten path, but you should definitely make it a point to come here when you are in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Food is a little pricey but really good. Not huge serving size. For some reason I had a bad stomach after eating the crab I was already skeptical when I was eating it me cause the taste was weird, didn't taste like crab at all, didn't taste fresh. I might give it a try next time but order something else."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  It was great to find this place off the strip.  Small not fancy place but everything about it is big.  Big flavors and big personality (our server was funny and just awesome).  The food was really good.  Try the broiled oysters.  My god, I just wanted to eat more and more. the entrees were good depending on what you ordered good beer and the desserts were awesome. Get the sweet potato pie.  This place is very casual.  Go if you want a no fuss restaurant with good Cajun food and great service."}
{"text":"I work downtown and have had lunch at Lola's a bunch of times with good food and service but my first experience at dinner tonight was a big disappointment. Food was ok though not spectacular (grits were overcooked & rubbery) and paying extra for cheese grits and red beans & rice at a Cajun joint seems like it oughtta be illegal. The real bummer came 20 minutes after we paid the bill. Poor service can sometimes be overlooked when a server is having an off night but you don't expect it from the manager or owner. I was reuniting with a close friend I haven't talked to for several years so our leisurely dinner was nearly two hours long and we had been talking for about 15 minutes after we paid the bill (which came very late) when the manager came over and told us a large group was coming in and he would need our table. He sounded perturbed and when I asked if he needed us to leave right now he suggested we could move to another table if we wanted to keep talking. We said no thanks and when I told him I didn't appreciate being rushed to leave our table he backtracked and apologized but didn't seem much effected when I told him I probably wouldn't come back. There are plenty of other good restaurants in downtown LV that don't mind letting old friends catch up for a few minutes after dinner."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star spot. It has great gumbo. It has great live entertainment. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We googled diners, dives and drive ins in Vegas and Lola's came up. We did not have a reservation but it was 5 pm on a Saturday so not busy yet and we got seated right away. 
We ordered the crab cake for appetizer. It was fair. We were pretty sure that there was just mayo as the sauce in the crab cake. I don't care for mayonnaise so this made it not as \"appetizing\" for me. Was surprised there wasn't a cool, handmade sauce on it

For our meal, we ordered the catfish and grits. It was a good portion size which is great because we always split our meals at restaurants. The catfish was seasoned well, on the spicier, yet flavorful side. The grits were amazing and yummy. We didn't care the the dry, grilled \"garlic\" Bread that didn't taste like garlic at all."}
{"text":"Ok, I admit it - I got sucked into the DD&D's hype over this place.  I bought into the pizzazz and popularity, just like Chris Humphries did with Kim, and had my own whirlwind romance - his lasted 72 days, mine lasted about 7.2 minutes.  But I think my romance ended a little better than his - glad I tried Lola's, it was good, but it didn't blow me away.

The gumbo was fine, but lacking a kick or any real distinguishing characteristics.  There's a place in Chicago that I grew up going to that does it so much better, so it was tough to not draw comparisons.

I got the shrimp & grits based on the waitress's recommendation of that item being \"what keeps the locals coming back.\"  Please note that I am in no way a connoisseur of grits, but these were way too cheesy and smooth for me - almost liquified, and completely overpowering with cheese.  But the gravy that included mushrooms & andouille sausage was good, as was the shrimp.

My dad had the fried chicken po' boy, and we found it to be boring - there was barely any chicken or sauce on it, and so it just felt sad and not Louisiana at all.  But his french fries were good.  My mom went with the jambalaya, which came out way too thick, like the consistency of the filling for chiles rellenos or shepherd's pie.  It did have a little kick of spice to it which was nice, but the rice was so so overcooked. 

Everything came out lickety-split, so if you're in a hurry you'd have no problem here.  If you've been to New Orleans and enjoyed the food, this doesn't feel like a true substitution for the real thing, but it's reminiscent enough to make you want to plan another vacation back to NOLA."}
{"text":"First of all, food was good. Mine anyway. I ordered pecan crusted trout with grits...WOW really tasty, delicious, excellent. My companion ordered a po-boy with fries. fries were good, but po boy was all bread, little meat and nothing else

If you get RYAN as your waiter (LOUD voice, big sideburns) ask for another...he's the reason I had to give it two stars.... service was HORRIBLE!

So, I ordered the trout and it came with a salad. I got the salad with the meal instead of beforehand. When my companion asked about it, Ryan completely ignored him and asked us if we wanted some free bread?  Just because we are black doesn't mean we always looking for free stuff. 

Then he never came back to check on how our meal was, long after the meal was done we were sitting there....no check....no offer of dessert or coffee...nada

RYAN this is why you got a lousy tip with a smiley fsce. :)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple years now and I've never been disappointed!! I always order the shrimp and grits!! Sooooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this version of the restaurant as it's closer to the strip. Sort of hard to get into & out of here but worth the trouble. Love that they have a GF menu; cornmeal crusted oysters are a favorite!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have had! Staff is very friendly but be advised that although Yelp says its open til 9pm the kitchen closes at 8:30. Staff is very friendly and they have a good selection of craft beers. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Hello Cajun food!  This place was great! Parking is not easy, and its a very small place, but it is worth the wait. The crawish hushpuppies were wonderful. Crispy and with a nice seasoning.  The fries are really good.  The blackened fish,,,,ahhhhh so excellent. The gumbo was just right.  The service was good and the price was right.  I recommend this place.  Go off of the strip and visit you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I keep forgetting to review them.  This is a great place for food. 
I love the blackened shrimp and grits. The shrimp is very tasty and the grits are very cheesy. Just delicious.
I've had a couple of the po-boys and they were very tasty. 
They also have a Summerlin location that is just as good."}
{"text":"The best part of the menu was the bread and my sweet potato. I had the catfish dinner with a baked sweet potato, greens and side order of red beans and rice. The food was cooked well but needed to be seasoned. I felt like I was eating in a hospital where nothing has salt. My family is southern an I was not empressed."}
{"text":"Wife loved the Gumbo. Had the shrimp etouffee which was excellent. Would visit again next time in the area! Thx, DDD!"}
{"text":"Bananas foster bread pudding was too much after I licked the bowl from my catfish and grits. If you don't leave the strip and try Lola's it doesn't matter how much you win you're leaving Vegas a loser!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice... Atmosphere, great food and it smells AWESOME FROM THE STREET.. That's why we stopped in..."}
{"text":"I love this place the gouda grits are to die for you can get them with blackened catfish or shrimp or as I do sometimes you can just get them as a side definitely try the oysters as a starter and finish with bread pudding great service you might want to make a reservation if it's a weekend"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food and service. Ordered wings on a scale of 5-10 and the chef made a point to come out and recommend the sauce be served on the side."}
{"text":"Quality Creole food at local finest.  Even if you dont like seafood an spicy food, the burgers are great too.  My kids even love it."}
{"text":"Crawfish boil season!  Off the hook if you like mudpuppies.  Got back to hotel in time to catch the DDD episode for them.  Must have been good timing.  Ha e the garlic bread and don't miss the Abita Andygator IPA!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, loved the place. There was nothing wrong with the menu or the ambiance. I felt like I was in New Orleans."}
{"text":"Almost a five star experience. This was my 3rd visit here,  but first time for dinner. Heads up make a reservation for dinner. Lola's will be featured on Diners, drive ins, and dives (ddd) on June 11th on FoodTV. The particular dish featured on the show will be the Roast Beef Debris po-boy. I took my parents here for dinner. My dad ordered the Roast beef debris. My mom ordered the Shrimp Etouffee and I ordered the Shrimp and Gouda grits. With out getting into too many details my dish and the shrimp etouffee that my mom ordered were easily 5 out 5 star dishes. The Roast beef debris po-boy was a 4 out of 5 star dish. Did not seem like the dish I would feature on DDD. Still a really good sandwich though. The only disappointing thing I had was the sweet tea. It didn't taste like the good sweet tea I've had in the south. It might have been old though. No big deal really,  just had a beer instead. More appropriate anyways. Dinner was great!  Service 5 out of 5 stars! The dessert was next. And this is where I was floored!  Ordered the banana pudding and the bread pudding. They also had a combination banana fosters bread pudding,  but I'll save that for next time. Anyways, the 2 puddings were spot on!  I'd put them both up against some of the best puddings I've ever had in Alabama,  Florida or Louisiana! These 2 desserts I'm praying are going to be featured on DDD.
Side note. Last time I was here for lunch I had the soft shell crab po-boy. I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars. The french bread they use for their po-boys is amazing.
Lola's is on my top 5 places to take people to eat in all of Las Vegas now. And that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check out this place for a while. The BF and I were in the area and I was able to persuade him. It was a random week day for dinner, but the place was completely packed. We were sat at a very nice table that wasn't too crowded, but I did notice that some of the tables could be a little bit squished. I think I'd be really nervous to come here on a busy night. 

The BF wasn't really sure about this place at first, but in the end he really liked it. I ordered the Shrimp Creole and it was very good. The shrimp were the perfect size and portion. The sauce had a little heat, but was very flavorful. I will definitely be ordering that again. The BF ordered Bronzed Catfish and grits. He said he really liked it, but his favorite item was the deep fried oysters that he ordered a la carte. We also ordered the Bananas Foster and it was scrumptious. The whole meal was a total success in my eyes and I can't wait to go back. 

Bonus points for the Shrimp Creole and Bananas foster both being Gluten Free."}
{"text":"Came for the first time and didn't disappointed. Really good, fast service and friendly staff. They also have local beers from Louisiana."}
{"text":"The food in the service is absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend thought that the food was not enough portion for a man to eat. Mine was the perfect size. Try the bronze catfish, crawpuppies, and shrimp creole."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. We got there and the owner is out front smoking. Tacky. 
However, the staff were very pleasant and playful. Enjoyed that. 
We ordered the hot artichoke and crab dip.  Pure oil and cheese. No flavor whatsoever. I topped it with Louisina hot sauce and that made it better. 
I ordered the salmon and my two sides were red beans and rice, as well as the greens with bacon. Both were under seasoned and bland. The rice was overcooked and loaded with water. The greens were soggy and absolutely had no flavor. The blackened salmon had an amazing Cajun rub, but was overcooked and dry. I've been to New Orleans and I hear the owner is from there .... so why is there no QA?  Someone needs to watch how this food is made and improve the dishes. Maybe it's a local thing and they take the spice out because most tourists are boring and don't like that kind of fare.  However, the cheese grits were amazing!!!!!  
I didn't taste or see any \"Holy Trinity\" in this place. It's an easy 3 ingredient with onions, bell peppers and celery. To make it even better add garlic, shallots and parsley. It makes any dish amazing. 
I'm a southern food obsessed foodie and it was bummed that it didn't live up to it's name. Sorry Guy Fieri, next time I'll try a Po Boy."}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem by accident.  Saw it out of the corner of my eye while trying to get back to the strip from our North Vegas hotel.  The have everything from the south, or rather, almost everything.  Their specialty is Louisiana cooking, mostly fish, crawfish, shrimp, and all the fixin's.  Decor quaint, service friendly, food excellent.  A nice place for family, a nice alternative to the pretentious restaurants in the casinos along the strip."}
{"text":"Went to the new Summerlin location on oct 4th for lunch with the girlfriends. Nice job converting the old Ruby Tuesdays!  Now with a cozy outside patio.  Piano in the bar area. They tell me there is sing a longs on Saturday nights.  Little bit of a sports theme...New Orleans Saints, with large screen TVs throughout. I had the jambalaya, friends had red beans and rice, cup of gumbo and chicken fingers. Service was quick and food came out rapidly!  All the food was excellent!  Cajun food had just the right bite for me and my friend. Chicken fingers, more like strips were lightly seasoned and were the best we have found for sometime.  French fried potatoes were fresh cut skin on, also fabulous!  Lola came over to say hello, says all of the proteins are fresh.  We could tell. For dessert we shared bananas foster bread pudding.  Sorry I'm not going into detail but it was all just plain GOOD FOOD!  I will be back. Welcome to Summerlin Lola's!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate to get off work early a couple of nights ago...and much to my surprise...my man got off at the same time. Hooray...impromptu date night. He suggested Grind burger but I wanted a po' boy from Lola's. He enthusiastically agreed and off we went. 

We arrive to a not very crowded restaurant so we were worried that they were closing soon (I have a no showing up 30 minutes prior to closing rule....it just works out better for all involved). They welcomed us with open arms willing to feed two very hungry people. 

Our server was very sweet and attentive (for the life of me I can't remember his name....shame on me...I do remember he wore glasses). We ordered our usual Abita beers (my man got an amber ale and I opted for the purple haze), crab cake appetizer with lemon garlic aioli, a fried shrimp po' boy and a roast beef debris po' boy (both dressed of course). As for side dishes...sweet potato fries were on my mind (be sure to ask for a side of honey mustard dressing...just makes the fries so much tastier...if that's possible). 

It was so yummy and just what the doctor ordered. There was very little conversation and lots of masticating (I LOVE that word). We were too full and tired for dessert....but we left very happy campers. We will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I don't care for the dinning area because it's so small and cramped.  I felt claustrophobic.  I had the BBQ Shrimp which was so delicious, I wanted more.  My second visit there was a 30 minute wait so I decided to order take out the next day.  I had the shrimp and grits.  This dish was not listed as spicy but it is very spicy and flavorful.  Again the shrimp was cooked perfectly and left me wanting more.  I'm sorry but the grits are just nasty.  I believe they put gouda cheese in them and that's all I tasted.  I couldn't eat them, just not my thing.  My friend had the catfish and grits.  She was disappointed because it was a few pieces of catfish nuggets.  The beans and rice was also good.  Everything had sausage in it so keep that in mind if you don't eat pork.  The meal came with bread but it was burnt, I don't like how they make it.  Also had crab cake which was just okay, I've had way better.  I'll definitely be back to try some of the other dishes when I can afford to.  I believe some of things on the menu are way over priced."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and food was on point. This is probably my 4th or 5th visit to this location and have never been disappointed. Thanks for making my daughters birthday special last night Lola's!"}
{"text":"This was the best Louisiana food I have had in a long time. We are differently going back next time we are in Las Vegas. You will not be disappointed. The shrimp and grits are to die for...."}
{"text":"Stopped at Lola's for a late lunch after sight seeing and boy were we glad we did.
Shared the gumbo and crawpuppies as an appetizer and they were very good.
My wife had the Shrimp & Grits, my son the D Breeze Po Boy and I had the Jambalaya. 
The shrimp and grits were absolutely delicious, and my son almost turned into a  Saint's fan with his first bit of the D Breeze. The jambalaya was tasty but I would have liked a little more sausage with it and a little more sauce. The bread apparently comes from New Orleans and was wonderful.
The service was fast and friendly, and the decore was fun. Thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely go back and have the Shrimp & Grits. 4.5 out of 5 in my book."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch since it was close to where I was for orientation. I was still kind of rushed since I wasn't expecting a sit-down meal, but I managed.

Service was very friendly and I felt bad that I was on hold/on the phone during a good portion of my meal, but I had some necessary phone calls to make during my lunch break. The interior is not that big, but it was full and lively for lunch.

I ordered the red beans and rice which also came with some coleslaw and toast, plus the crawpuppies. I don't think the crawpuppies were worth the money (at $5+ for four crawpuppies, that's over $1 per piece). The red beans and rice were delicious though!

There is a parking lot around the corner and then it's a short walk to the restaurant's entrance. Lola's serves up some tasty cajun/creole fare, but nothing compares to the original in New Orleans!"}
{"text":"Great location.... Very authentic...... Wait time for food could be shortened.... Still highly reccommend"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing!!!! I had the shrimp and grits and I was not disappointed. Make sure to save room for dessert because the banana fosters is yummy the serving is pretty big great for sharing."}
{"text":"The best part about the meal was my sweet tea and my server. I'm not sure what part of New Orleans Lola is from but it's not the Cajun cooking part. The food was bland and season less. The desserts which I had pecan sweet potato pie tasted like nothing but nutmeg and the banana pudding I tried had no consistency."}
{"text":"I love bringing people here! Every time it's great! I love the shrimp po boy and the blackened shrimp caesar! Whatever you order will be great! I love that they serve Abita Purple Haze! Haven't saved enough room for dessert just yet but I'll try them one of these days :)"}
{"text":"Being a Nawlins native I must say, I have never been so disappointed in my life!  Oysters were the size of my pinky nail. Definitely a FAIL!"}
{"text":"Charmingly southern restaurant!  Food is some of the best outside of New Orleans.  Gumbo is especially good.  Service is prompt, courteous and informative.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Had such a GREAT LUNCH!!!! The staff was very personable and knowledgeable about the entire menu... i had the fried chicken salad and steamed shrimp!!!!! The soft shell PO BOY and the shrimp PO boy were amongst the tables favorites as well!!!  Try them out"}
{"text":"The food was great. The frid shrimp was Crispy not oily and the breading had sum mild spice the fries were fresh potatoes not frozen and the side of slaw had green and red peppers and red onion adding an awsome flavor to a Crispy treat...what a great hidden treasure in the downtown"}
{"text":"It's a shame that this place is so easy to pass over. I don't think my inner fat child could have been any more pleased after they brought out the plumpest most delicious crab came I've seen in a while. Put that menu on a dart board, throw a dart and order what it lands on. You will never lose that game."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back! We had lunch there and arrived at 11:30, we were seated in the back hallway. It was a little weird, but judging by how many people were there it must be good eats! I ordered a sample platter that is not on the menu and includes a cup of etoufee, gumbo and red beans and rice. We also ordered sweet potato fries to start. Fries arrived right away and lunch soon after. We did not have to wait long. EXCEPTIONAL! My sample platter didn't look like much but it was a whole lot of food. I could only eat about half and I can put food away. Half way through lunch, it was standing room only for seating. This little joint is amazing! As long as it stays on point, we will be regulars!"}
{"text":"They were out of the fresh oysters. Other than that this is definitely a must try if you are indecisive. Very good food. I know I will be returning. Probably to try some thing different this time. Although I could definitely have my same dish again."}
{"text":"We loved this place so much that we ate there twice in a 4 day trip.  Really great food, at least the cajun dishes.  They did not stint on ingredients, for example the gumbo had more than adequate amounts of sausage, chicken, and shrimp, nicely balanced.  A refreshing change from places that skimp on shrimp or even leave it out altogether.

(I am aware that gumbo is legitimately open to interpretation.   But at restaurant prices i expect the full treatment! )

Great atmosphere,  a little loud but forgivable when the place is clearly full of happy patrons. 

We had a long wait the 2nd time - it is definitely worth making reservations. 

This restaurant seems all the better for being out of the casinos which even at their best are basically chain restaurants at all price levels.  I am grading up a bit -- but for LV, this place deserves top marks."}
{"text":"Just not very good. I told them the po boy didn't taste right and the didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"YUM. lola's is great! we made reservations tonight and it made me really happy that it was a REAL reservation- as in, a little table with a card on it that said, \"reserved.\" (i hate making reservations and then ending up waiting 10 or 15 minutes after i get there because there aren't any tables available!)

we started our meal with a crab cake appetizer topped with creamy lemon aioli. (we debated between this and the gumbo... the crab cake was good,  but next time it will HAVE to be the gumbo.) after that came some awesome garlic bread- it was crispy and crunchy and light and yumyumyum. we polished off the basket almost embarrassingly quickly. that bread was seriously amazing.

my husband's jambalaya did not impress me- it was kind of mushy, but i've never been a huge fan of the stuff anyway. i loved my entrée, though- the shrimp were spicy and perfectly cooked, the gouda grits were rich and creamy and the andouille-mushroom sauce on top of everything was super deliciously savory. i sopped up every. last. bite.

despite making a complete pig of myself (in my defense, i went hiking this afternoon and worked up an appetite), i did save a little bit of room for dessert and tried the bread pudding! bread pudding is so easy to make that i usually don't bother to order it out but i had a craving and our apartment is still in a shambles from our move so there isn't much baking in my future. it was a success- sweet and smooth and served with whipped cream on top, yum! even my husband (who is generally more of a chocolate dessert fellow) liked it... i think he had a touch of food envy, hehe."}
{"text":"Sitting on 2.5 star fence and could jump either way. Been there about a half dozen times. First couple were great, but last two visits were less than average.

Love etouffee and when I have the chance to hit a Cajun joint, will order. Last two times the portion was extremely small and VERY salty. For me to say salty, it is SALTY. 

Service is slow and getting drinks would have been faster if I'd hopped back in the car and brought something back. It was hard to get any refills on anything. They appeared more disorganised than usual. On the plus side they were very busy. I may return and try the Summerlin location, but if I find another place w crawfish etouffee, I'm there first."}
{"text":"As my other Yelp friends have said, WELL worth the trip off the strip.  Get the heck out of glitz breakfast and come here where Louisiana food, hospitality and great service are just the standard.  I came for breakfast, but couldn't resist the gumbo I saw walk past my table.  It was outstanding, as well as were the sides of grits.  Top it off with fresh coffee and you've got all you could want at a price half the strip with twice the service.  

For lunch, there is a great list of sandwiches and po-boys that my friends have reviewed.  Oh, and they have a full line up of Abita beers, long way from home, but a must for any authentic Louisiana kitchen.  Highly recommended.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. A great stop on the way to the Smith Center. Fast service without jeopardizing the food quality.  I do recommend calling for reservations,  it fills up quick."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here due to all the hype that surrounds this place. I was pretty disappointed, not only from the food but from the service as well.

Food:
-Crawfishpupies: I found them really bland. Nothing more to say.
-Artichoke and Crab dip: Nothing stood out from this.
-Red Beans and Rice: Also very bland.
-Shrimp and Grits: This was actually pretty good. I enjoyed it, but it's not a dish that would have me coming back on my own accord.
-Bananas Foster Bread pudding: This was good. It wasn't what I ordered, but it was good.

Service: 
I understand if it's your first day as a server, but you should at least have a pen and pad on you at all times if not just to take notes. But also if your short term memory is really bad, and you know it is, a pen and pad would be really helpful so that you're not constantly running back and forth several times just trying to get the drink orders right. And why not just shadow the \"real server\" if you're just going to be relaying everything back to her and then mess it up or forget?

I also don't understand why service was so slow, especially with the speed our food came out. At the time we were the only people sitting on the patio, and it slowly started filling up, but we still had no food and we had an insane amount of empty cups on our table.

I had requested a bananas foster and a bread pudding to-go and was given a bananas foster bread pudding. I told the waitress that that wasn't what I ordered and she said, well that's what I was told what you ordered (from the first day as as server kid). I asked if the check reflected the two separate items and she replied, with attitude, that no, I have to fix the check now. I was already disappointed with the service and that the food didn't live up to the hype so I just wanted to get out of there and told the waitress that I'll just take the desert that I have now and she seemed shocked and said that it'll only take 4 minutes to get what I had originally wanted. I said no thank you, I will just take this desert and maybe your other server should carry a pen and pad with him. and she replied, with an attitude again, sorry it's his first day, but have a nice weekend."}
{"text":"Our fifth visit to Lola's. We come here every time we are in Vegas because it is THAT GOOD. I do not use this word often as I am an extremely literal person but Lola's is PERFECTION. The grits are transcendent, the shrimp (bronzed or fried) are succulent, the gumbo is heaven, the jamabalaya is the perfect amount of spice, the bread (from NoLa) is cloud-like but crusty, and the sweet tea tastes like a cool breeze on a hot, New Orleans, June day.

Make the trip north and enjoy this tiny piece of perfection on earth."}
{"text":"Website is very misleading. Planned on giving it a try but as we pulled up our taxi driver suggested we go somewhere else.  He wasn't comfortable leaving us there.  It was nothing like the website portrayed it to be."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, so this place is a cute \"Lil' Hole in the Wall\".  You'll typically find the best food here.  I can't say I was so fortunate.  We started with the Hot Crab & Artichoke Dip.  It was basic and bland I thought, but the hubby enjoyed it!  The plate presentation was appealing but the portion size left me wanting more.  The food, ($15) Catfish platter w/ greens & sweet potato fries where good, but I could really have eaten an additional filet... but not for $10.99.  GEESH, they should have an add on just like the Shrimp & Grits (which my manz had).  I LOVE a nice & strong fountain drink, but this Dr. Pepper was kinda flat. Oh well... I'm going home for a snack as none of the desserts appealed to me. It's me, not them!  
Oh and the service was fine.  Not too in your face, and not lagging.  I doubt that I'd return.  #ontothenext"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. The wait staff were kind but the food was great. I had the crawpuppies as an appetizer, and they were very good. However, they were definitely on the small side. It was about $5-6 for 4 little crawfish balls about the size of a quarter - would have loved more. The highlight to the meal was the shrimp and grits. Incredible. The Gouda grits were creamy and seasoned well. Served with gulf shrimp, sausage, and mushrooms. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll definitely come back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas for about 3 days.  My hotel in on the heart of the Strip.  Tons of places to eat, tons of places to go.  However, most of those places are crap as far as eating.  I went to Guy Fieri's for dinner and I can't decide which was better, that restaurant or the Denny's down the street.  Finally today, a friend of mine who is living here scooped me up and took me to Lola's.  

Exterior-wise, Lola's is nothing to look at.  It's in a commercial/industrial complex.  I thought it was a framing store at first.  The interior was a little better, but the Chandelier it ain't.  Very basic but clean decor.  I would call it industrial homestyle.  We got off to a bad start as the hostess asked us if we would be able to eat in about an hour and a fifteen minutes.  I was taken aback by that even though she asked very professionally and courteously.  They were having a private party soon.  The other issue that got us off to a bad start was that in the bathroom were about 4 floaters.  By no means the restaurant's fault, but that's not usually the image you want before you look at the menu.

So I forgot about that (until I started writing this) and glanced at the menu.  Andy was our server..  Andy was interesting because we had an odd back and forth about the difference a half-and-half, an Arnold Palmer, and a monsterade (or something like that).  According to Andy, an Arnold Palmer is unsweetened tea and a lemonade, a monsterade is sweet iced tea mixed with lemonade, and a half-and-half doesn't exist.  As a Baltimorean, this is absurd but I was more hungry than I was argumentative.  Before I begin on the food, I have a disclaimer to make.  I have a bizarre habit of almost never ordering seafood if I'm somewhere inland.  Lola's menu is predominantly seafood because of the Creole faire. I decided to roll the dice and ordered the shrimp and grits.  Here comes another disclaimer; whenever shrimp and grits is on the menu, I order it so that I can compare all of the shrimp and grits I've had.  My friend ordered the soft-shelled crabs.  Our food came out at hyper-speed with a lovely presentation.   My shrimp and grits was good.  In comparison to the other dishes I've had, it was good albeit a bit on the spicy side.  I love spicy, but it seems like the spiciness was masking the lack of other seasonings.  Still delicious though.  My friend DESTROYED his soft-shelled crabs so I assume they too were good.  

So please leave the Strip alone if you want to go eat and get an Uber or Lyft to take you to Lola's.  Good creole food for under $50 AND you're out of there in less than an hour and 15 minutes."}
{"text":"It's the best of las Vegas for a reason.  Excellent southern food.  Get the grits and shrimp or catfish.  Or with any Damn order.  Sweet tea could be sweeter but we aren't in the south and it's way better than Canes sweet tea."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Love the charbroiled oysters and the bronzed catfish with grits. We've been there a few times, and I have my mind made up that I'm going to try a different entree, but just don't seem to do it.  Love those grits!"}
{"text":"Literally the best thing I have ate since I moved to vegas got the bronzed catfish and grits omg this is what southern food dreams are made of"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times.  I enjoy the jambalaya as well as bronzed shrimp with grits.  Their creole cuisine is the most authentic in Vegas and I get food to go when I am in the area.  Service is always good."}
{"text":"Hot n juicy what? Crab corner who?  That's what u will be asking yourself after tasting Lola's crawfish. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned

So after we went zip lining at Freemont Street this afternoon, we were HONGRY...As we pass by a sign indicating that Lola's have Louisiana Style boiled crawfish, Friday and Saturday, I quickly yelped Lola's. Called and learned that 200lbs of live crawfish is flown in to be boiled for perfection. Sounds good to us so we made a U-turn.  

When we walked into this little restaurant, we immediately feel as if though we were somewhere in Louisiana.  The decor was mardi gras-ish.  We looked at the menu and saw that 5lbs of crawfish, w/potato and corn for $41.99.  That sounds pretty awesome but we played it safe and ordered 1lb to see if it meets our expectation prior to going for the big bang.  After 5 mins or so, our 1lb of crawfish along with a corn on the cob and a cute little potato came out.  We each grabbed a crawfish...it smelled right...snap off the tail and peeled off the shell, took a bite and WOW.  The meat was tender and juicy, was seasoned perfectly.  They were not drenched in oil and/or butter like the competition.  No need for any condiment.  Lola made it right.  We then quickly flagged our waiter down and politely asked if we may take advantage of the 5lbs deal by adding another 4lbs to the order.  He asked Lola and she was so awesome to allow it.  10 mins later, Lola brought out the 4lbs of crawfish to us herself.  She is such a wonderful and funny lady owner.  And, best of all, she knows how to make delicious crawfish.  

We also ordered a dozen wings with fries.  We liked them naked fried so we asked the waiter beforehand if they were battered fried or naked fried.  He responded that they are naked fried.  WRONG!  They came out battered fried.  BOOOOOO.  But the flavor was there so we let it go.  We learned that our waiter has only been there for 2 weeks so it's ok.  The crawfish was so tasty that it didn't matter.

To end this wonderful lunch at Lola's, we   ordered the bread pudding.  It was warm and moist, with a hint of Mr. Jim Bean secret concoction.  YUM.

It has been hard for us to find a place that makes crawfish like how we remembered it to be in the South.  All the other items on the menu looks delicious, but we can't find ourselves ordering anything other than crawfish!  As soon as crawfish season is over, we will delve into the other menu items, like the red bean and rice, jambalaya, and so many more...

If you love crawfish, this place is a must. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Make sure you have an appetite when you come here!! Amazing food. Portions are great size and the food is remarkable.. They out did themselves.. Even the dessert was spectacular! Two thumbs up from our family!"}
{"text":"It was highly recommended that I visit Lola's while in Vegas. I was very excited to try this place being that I love Cajun/creole food. In my opinion the food I tried was very basic. Nothing special. I ordered a shrimp PO boy with fried shrimp and a side of the Gouda Grits."}
{"text":"A small restaurant that was on my show \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\".

In a nutshell very Friendly and upbeat staff.

I'd like to go back and try some other entrees to get a better cross section of good quality. But, I'll review what I had.

Apparently, it's pretty popular! everything I read mostly was all good. I've learned one thing over the years and that's popular doesn't always mean \"Great.\" That said, Lola's is GOOD, but not GREAT overall n my opnion.

Crab Cakes were good. Nicely seasoned, nice size and decent texture. The little greens it came with were not that good. the Gumbo was OK... just OK. It was rich, dense and dark. Slightly smoky. was lacking real flavor compared what i have had in New Orleans not even close.

Now the Jambalaya reminds me of what you'd get in New Orleans to an extent. the flavor was on point and I would definitely order that again.The Shrimp were amazing in the Jambalaya. The pricing for the portion was not cool at all though lol.

All in all..... I would probably give it another chance and try other things on the menu like the Shrimp Creole for example. which I read was very good. It did not reach my expectations but the food was decent overall."}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant to get away from the Strip, it was featured on Triple D (Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives), and because of the char-grilled oysters. 
Location was in a bit of an odd spot. Which was apparent since my driver had a difficult time locating the restaurant. 
The service was pleasant. We were well taken care of throughout the visit. 
As for the food, the jambalaya was a bit on the salty side but flavorful. I was somewhat disappointed with the oysters. The still had the \"fishy\" taste and the seasoning (butter and Romano cheese) was inconsistent. 
Gotta go with/ three stars for this location for these reasons."}
{"text":"Lola's was featured on Diners, Dive-in, and Dives therefore it was a no brainier to stop in. The place is whether small, so the wait was long. I asked the hostess could my party order drinks while waiting. She, rudely uttered, \"one of you can go to the bar\". No worries, I thought, as she appeared to be busy with nothing. The night hit a downward spiral from then on. We were offered seats from the hostess, but never seated three times. Once we were seated the bad service continued with our server who never brought anything back we requested. To top it all off, we were chased down in the parking lot asking if we paid out bill. Embarrassing!!!! Needless to say, I will never be eating there again. The food was sub par, the portion sides were unacceptable, and the price didn't match our return. I wish I could offer negative stars!!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh, How I've missed you, New Orleans!  Lola's is a Devine little spot, my friend and I came here when they had JUST opened up. We even sat with the owners, who seemed nervous but excited to see theoir business take off.

And take off it HAS! My friend and I aren't good at decisions so, we ordered nearly the entire menu.. Kidding.

For app's, We had the \"Lump Blue Crabcake\" & the \"Crawpuppies\", which we smashed almost as soon as she put it down! 

Then we ordered the \"Red Beans & Rice\" ( SO good ) & the \"Jambalaya\" ( Ehh.. ) .. To share. Lol, and finally for our entreés, we enjoyed the \"Gumbo\" ( OhMyGod, YUM!! ) and my friend got the \"Catfish & Grits\" ( Also very tasty )

And as if that wasn't enough... ( *unbuttons pants* ) GET THE BANANA FOSTER BREAD PUDDING!!!! 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Live Lola's Louisiana Kitchen. Great place for a lunch date with amazing Louisiana dishes on the menu. The baked oysters are magnificent, and the gumbo truly done right. Love the atmosphere of the place too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We went to check out the art district and figured we would check out Lola's as we have heard a lot about it.
When you walk in it is very cozy and friendly. The staff is also a plus. 
We had the craw puppies and a crab cake for starters. Both were really good. The craw puppies are their take on a hush puppy but so much better. Little fried craw fish balls of delight. The crab cakes at this place are so good and might I add that Lola is very generous with the amounts of real crab meat. It came out on a bed of greens with aioli drizzled on the top.
For dinner, I tried the signature cat fish and grits and my friend had the blackened shrimp po-boy. The fish and grits were very good with pieces of sausage and mushroom in the sauce. My friend loved the po-boy and thought it was just the right size. The sweet potato fries were really good and even better with a side of the secret craw puppy dip.
We were so full but had to try dessert anyway. We share the bread pudding and bananas foster. BEST BREAD PUDDING I have ever eaten and I have tried a lot all over the country. It comes out nice and hot with a side of whipped cream. The bananas foster was a hit too. The presentation wasn't a five star but the taste was a ten.
After we finished and were ready to go, Lola herself came out to see us. I have to saw that I was shocked that the owner took time away from the kitchen to see how they did. She is a sweet lady and very hospitable covered in Saints gear.

I will be back to Lola's many times. The food was great and the service was just as good!"}
{"text":"First visit to Lola's cajun restaurant with my husband.  Just saw the sign driving by and said let's try it!  Excellent atmosphere, food and service!  I will be back to Lola's every time I visit Las Vegas from now on!  My blackened catfish over grits was the Bomb!  Fresh, moist, seasoned just right!  I even ordered bread pudding and coffee for desert (and I never order desert, but Lola's just got me in the spirit!  Happy returning customers all around us :). You must eat here; you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch w my sister and so happy with the kind and attentive service & delicious food! If you're not sure because it is a little pricey, go for it! Everything we got was perfectly seasoned, with just the right amount of spice! Loved it."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on Guy's  Diners Drive-Inns and Dives..so I decided to take my son for his birthday. His dad is from Louisiana and we were so disappointed in the food. The gumbo and the shrimp etouffe have no flavor at all.   The shrimp poboy  was ok..but the fries were cold and hard. The atmosphere is a little too close for comfort."}
{"text":"Small joint, but some great southern cooking.  Had the shrimp po-boy and 1/2 dozen oysters.  Yum yum!  Be sure to make reservations though as its a tiny restaurant with just over 35 seats.  Might have to wait for a table and the bar seats 6.  Worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this place for a while.  It definitely was well worth the wait!  We shared a crab cake, and to my surprise it wasn't fried as hard as others that I've had.  I ordered the goods cheese grits with shrimp and it was cooked to perfection.  Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"As good as I remember. I had the Tchoupli something or another. Fried catfish (not actual cat obvi) smothered in crawfish etouffee. Delish! If jumping up on tables and snatching food wasn't totally unacceptable behavior, I would have like to sample many of the yummy looking dishes passing by."}
{"text":"Was looking for something interesting to eat off the strip... Lola's didn't disappoint!!! Service was top notch food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place ever since I saw it featured on Diners, Dine-ins, and Dives. I am the biggest crawfish fan EVER. I'm that girl that's willing to sit at a table by herself with her little bib, hiding behind pounds and pounds of those tiny little critters. So when I saw that there was an authentic southern creole restaurant that can be found in Vegas, I went nuts. Sadly, being from the South, it didn't live much to my expectations. 

I ordered the shrimp & grits and it wasn't everything I hoped it to be. Grits were a little bland, but grits in general are hard to make flavorful so I'm not too hard to judge on that. But overall, the dish was just okay. 

However, the one thing that will have me coming back again and again, is their fried oysters. So delish. It's a must try! .. But that's pretty much it. I've also ordered the crabcakes as a side item in the past and it's not my favorite, and something I wouldn't go for again. 

Business still seems to do well here so there must be something I'm missing. It's a small restaurant that can get pretty crowded quickly. A waiting area for a table is pretty much non-existent. My server was quite busy and wasn't very attentive. She was also helping another large table, so I'm not too fussy about the service. 

I still need to come back for the crawfish, but it's only served on Fridays, so it makes it a little difficult. Hopefully I can make a 3rd attempt at Lola's before the crawfish is out of season. Once it's out of a season.. I don't think I could find a big reason to come rushing back."}
{"text":"I had the bronzed shrimp and grits! It was delicious and the presentation was nice. The ambience is very cool with a Southern vibe that felt natural.  The service was great as our server made sure to refill my iced tea several times. Great experience."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom across the board! Yeah if I could keep eating with no remorse this place would be it! For someone that has never been to New Orleans Lola's pulled me right in. Take note and order the Gouda grits! It was one of those food moments we ordered so much and proceeded to stuff our faces just because. You won't be disappointed and the service was great! Already planning my next LV trip and putting Lola's on the bucket list. Thanks to Wes and Syd for putting me on game to this joint!"}
{"text":"Second try.  Had to sit outside because they gave away my table as I was stuck in traffic.  Ok. There's a minus.    Got the wrong side order and the waiter asked me if I t wanted it, duuuh if I wanted it I would have ordered it.  No bread I was told but the table next to me got bread.  The waiter asked if we wanted deserts and I asked for the menu but he said I'll tell you what to order.  I wonder how this will fly when they open in Summerlin as a locals restaurant.  Maybe the tourists don't care but residents do.  The food is fine but there are real problems here."}
{"text":"If you want the real New Orleans experience without leaving vegas this is the place to go. Everything down to the paint on the walls screams New Orleans."}
{"text":"This place was featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives... and as a Food Network fanatic, I was so excited to try this place!  The food here is delicious!  I've never been to New Orleans (hopefully someday soon), but the gumbo I had was so tasty with just enough spice.  And I ordered Oysters... they were kind of like Oysters Rockefeller.  The oysters were delicious too but that's where I had to minus one star. They were actually the smallest oysters I have ever seen/ate in my life.  Teeny tiny little morsels.  But nonetheless, the flavor on the oysters were delicious!  The people seated next to us said to try the Po Boy... they looked good for sure!  Perhaps next time."}
{"text":"Try this place it is unequivocally the Best!
Food Better than Exclent!
Service Liz is on it for sure Excellent!
Try it you will love It!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff
The red beans and rice are delicious 
The bread they use for their po boys is amazing and their fries cut fresh
Didn't have room for dessert but the table next to us did and it made our mouths water"}
{"text":"If entrees with grits are gold, then entrees with grits, gouda, sausage, and catfish are platinum. With all its bling, Lola's is pretty pimp.

Thanks to Michele E. and fellow Yelpers who suggested the bronzed catfish and craw puppies. Those two dishes attracted me back to Lola's for a second time and will certainly get me back for a third.  Even though I've never been to New Orleans, I agree with Blair B. who described the Po Boy as a little small. It's short on shrimp. Split in two,it yielded 4\" halves that contained two shrimp each. More shrimp would set it off.

Lola's also offers great service, a tasty selection of beers and wine (at affordable prices), and a fun atmosphere. Saturday nights are particularly fun because of the live band."}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant, very authentic Cajun food and I just find no negatives with my experience there. I ordered the bronze catfish with grits and the Lowcountry greens. I ordered a phenomenal dessert, the banana foster bread pudding. That is probably one of the best desserts I have ever eaten anywhere. I would go back there just for that dessert. There you have it."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Went for lunch during work... and it was packed. Food was good, everyone enjoyed the special bread, the collard greens (with bacon), PoBoy, and I had the BBQ shrimp and loved it. Only thing-it put us all in a food coma for the rest of the day. Would go back on a day off or for dinner.. eat outside if the weather allows."}
{"text":"It's was good had the gumbo and crab cake. Small restaurant but charming. Portions are decent but definitely not big enough to share. Comes with garlic bread loved it the most very soft."}
{"text":"I came here while in Vegas for work and the food was fantastic. I ordered the bronzed catfish and gouda grits, which were delicious! Also ordered their crawpuppies, which are small balls of crawfish deep fried, and came with a side of Cajun aioli. The aioli was amazing. I asked the waiter if they sold it, she said no, I told her that they should, because I was prepared to purchase some, it was that good. My friend ordered the shrimp Creole, which he enjoyed, however, he was disappointed with the amount of shrimp he was given (3 pieces). Other than that, the food was amazing, the service was good, and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Food was amazing for NOLA food in Vegas.  Thought they were great service and the shrimp n grits was Better than the recommended dish which was the blacken catfish.  Both wee good but loved the Shrimp better."}
{"text":"Food was fun and priced very well . Smother the grits on the garlic bread, finish with that pudding and you'll be in heaven  4stars cause it gets really busy inside and your so close to the people next to you . If you go request outside seating"}
{"text":"Lola's is a new fave downtown! Came here for a work dinner with my coworkers and it was fantastic. Loved the overall atmosphere and the service was on point. You gotta try the jambalaya if you go, especially with shrimp. It makes me wish I had three more stomachs so I could just keep on eating... That being said because the portion size was huge. It kept me fed for a few days, not an exaggeration!"}
{"text":"Being that I lived where Creole food is very popular I was excited to see Louisiana cooking here in vegas. 

The hostess wasn't that good, seating us in the \"hallway\" rather than in the cozy dining room, but oh well. It was a bit noisy for our taste anyway, but the waitress totally forgot about us. 

Just due to the service I almost give them two stars, but the food made up for it! The mud bug's were spot on and the salad was excellent as well! The gumbo is very nice. 

In closing this is the best Creole food that I have had outside of Houston-Biloxi. In that region I would have only given it two stars, but for not being in the area it is great. 

I will return, but I hope service is better the next time that I go."}
{"text":"Had dinner and it was OK but not memorable.  Certainly worth another try except the Hushpuppies... which were little moonrocks."}
{"text":"My significant other recommended this restaurant as an alternative to other cuisine choices we normally make. Having been to Louisiana I concurred. The choice was impeccable. The food was delicious, and the hospitality terrific. If you can't go to New Orleans and you live or visit Vegas this restaurant should be a must for dining."}
{"text":"I'm a huge huge fan of creole/cajun food and I'm sorry, but Lola's did not measure up.  Hubby had the fried chicken po-boy and I had the fried chicken with potato salad and green bean sides.  None of the food was anything special and the green beans were overcooked and tasteless - kind of like they came from a can (soggy) and microwaved. Also, the waitress was not very friendly and at times, it seemed like we were bothering her.  And then there was a weird and uncomfortable interaction at the end of the meal with the check - she said that she had to hold $2 back in change because they were running out of $1s.  What?!  It was early afternoon.  Would not return."}
{"text":"I watch too much of the Food Network.

I noticed that Guy Fieri has featured a few Las Vegas places on Diner's Drive In's and Dives. Lola's was obviously one of them.

I actually ate the Roast Beef \"D Brees\" which is listed on the menu as also being the item Guy Fieri ate. I don't know what I was looking for in this sandwich, but I get the feeling Guy liked it more than I did. I'd order it again, but for reasons I can't explain, I just didn't taste the \"wow\" in the sandwich.

My wife, if I am not mistaken has a shrimp po' boy and she enjoyed it very much.

Again I watch too much of the Food Network.

Between entering Lola's, looking at the menu, and waiting for server to take our order, we of course looked around the establishment. Cute decor, I love to look for Guy's \"face\" in the diner's, drive-ins and dives that he has visited. But I also noticed a few nicks here and there on the walls. Obviously from tables and chairs hitting the walls.

Again I watch too much of the Food Network, because after I noticed the walls, I couldn't help but wonder what would Guy's friend Robert Irvine of Restaurant Impossible think of the chips in the walls?

We arrived within the first hour of business. By the time we left Lola's was impressively crowded.

Another part that bothered me is what is there for kids at Lola's. I noticed here on YELP that Lola's is listed as kid friendly. I wouldn't say no, and I wouldn't say yes to that. I didn't see a children's menu. I would only take my kids, if we could sit at one of the four patio tables.

All in all a very nice and relaxing meal. Wonderful service. But due to my watching too much of the Food Network, I just didn't get that \"wow\" feeling that I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here for a brunch/lunch meal on a Saturday. We arrived prior to opening so seated right away which was a good thing since it was packed by the time we left. Oysters appetizer and Gouda grits were crazy good. The grits are a must! The étouffée was rather average but there were many selections. We went here because I love Cajun food and did not realize it was on triple D. Cool little art area if you have time as well. Will try again when in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the fresh vegetables that are grown on site. The service is outstanding and the gumbo is the best. I can't wait to go back for just coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"Lola's is a must, when I visit Las Vegas. The food is authentic and delicious and plentiful and reasonably priced. The service has always been excellent. On my last trip, Andy was our server. He could not have been more helpful or considerate. There are two locations, for this restaurant. The Summerlin location is modern and reminiscent of most restaurants. The downtown location, on Charlston, is quaint and charming. Both locations have excellent food, but the Charleston location is definitely my preference. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook. Definitely one of the best meals that my wife and I have ever had. If you are ever in Las Vegas this is a \"MUST\" place to eat. Upon arriving we were greeted nicely and seated promptly by Ryan (who is a top notch waiter in our opinion). Ryan really knows the food on the menu and answered all of our questions with a professional confident attitude and a great sense of humor. He recommended the Charbroiled Oysters as an appetizer, a Blackened Shrimp Po Boy sandwich for my wife and the Blackened Shrimp & Grits and an Abita S.O.S. beer for me (an awesome beer!). The quality of ingredients used were first rate and the preparation and flavors were as good as it gets. We finished off the meal with a Banana's Foster Bread Pudding dessert and like the rest of the meal it was incredible. We saw this place featured on Diner's, Drive-in's & Dives and it totally lived up to the hype. When we come back to Las Vegas again this will be the first place we go to eat."}
{"text":"My friends decided to have a surprise party for me and two other friends all born within the same week in May.  The surprise wasn't just the birthday party surprise, but how good the food served at this restaurant!  

Everyone told me \"you must get the shrimp and grits...\"  what do I do?  I get the Shrimp and Grits and two other dishes...haha...sharing with my friends of course!  

Now I've been to New Orleans and I've have the authentic grits from the south, Grits in NOLA is still the best, but the shrimp and grits at Lola's comes PRETTY close to the grits down south!  So creamy and cheesy and perfectly paired with cajun spiced shrimp....amazing and fixed my craving for the time being!  If you are craving some shrimp and grits, Lola's is definitely the place to go to get that in Vegas!  

Another memorable dish I had here were the crawfish hush puppies or they like to call it the crawpupppies!  Very good, crunchy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside.  I think I ate like 3 of those delicious bite sized pieces of fried goodness!  

I wasn't a fan of the BBQ shrimp, and we also got a noodle dish that was pretty good (forgot the name). 

My other friend ordered the Gumbo, which tasted like gumbo.  It was good, and tasted authentic, but when it comes down to what was the best dish, The shrimp and grits won the challenge!  

I'll definitely be coming back here to try other dishes on their menu real soon! =D"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp creole and it was amazing. The crab cake was good and the gumbo was spicy but in a southern way. We tried the banana foster bread pudding to top off the dinner and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Lola's a few nights ago about 8 p.m.; they close at p.m. Mon-Thursday 10 on Fridays. It was a nice little restaurant with a nice Louisiana / New Orleans atmosphere. I really liked showing up around then, the restaurant had a few others dining in it so overall it was a great quiet dinner with my girl. I ordered a \"Fat Tire\" beer and she ordered a Riesling, which was a very good wine. 

We Decided on an appetizer of \"Hot Crab and Artichoke Dip\" served with bagel chips was I thought at first lacking in seasoning, namely pepper, but I let it go and come to find and enjoy the subtly of the flavors we ended up really enjoying this dish.

For an entrée I ordered there \"Shrimp and Grits\" which were served with smoked Gouda grits and Andouille sausage and mushroom ragout. I have to admit I have never had better grits in my life and I like grits. Eating the grits with some shrimp and sausage all together gave a really great flavor. I used some of the toasted bread they serve to sop up the sauce... Nom Nommy Nom Noms!

My girlfriend ordered the \"Shrimp Étouffée\" which was also very tasty though I have to say we both loved the shrimp and grits better and she was very envious of my choice. My girlfriend happens to be a \"grits Nazi\" and she even said they were up there in her book. ~Grins~

To end the meal we shared \"Lola's Famous Bread Pudding\" and well... It must be this bread pudding rocked. I love bread pudding. It has a nice firm yet moist consistency through and through not like the stuff you get at casinos where the bottoms all soggy and scrambled at the same time. It came covered in a nice rum praline sauce that was just right. The bread pudding part of it had no raisins or chocolate etc... jammed into it, which it to speak for itself and we really enjoyed that.

The server was very nice and fast and it was really nice that the owner and chef \"Beth Pokorny\" (I looked her name up online) came out to ask us how our meals were and if we were enjoying ourselves. You just do not see this much these days.

Our bill was not bad for everything we enjoyed and overall I think we have a new favorite place in Las Vegas. We will definitely be going there again for my girl's birthday next month and if you have not tried Lola's I would sincerely recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Amazing. I had the Charbroiled oysters and shrimp poboy and food tasted great. Great fast service also."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here before until today. I ordered for take out due to not having time to dine in. I spent $12 for the jambalaya chicken and sausage and was very excited for my meal, UNTIL I got back to work and opened the packaging only to realize that the container wasn't even half way filled with food! I'm heavily disappointed and will not return! Now I have another 7 hours to work on a stomach half filled with food. Not worth the money at all to take out!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A decent Po boy along with some decent po boys. They always seem busy so there is a nice buzz and its decorated well. I didn't feel the food would really  warrant another trip but it's not bad."}
{"text":"Tasty.  Found this on Tripple D.  Flavorful.  Bananna Foster Bread pudding, excellent. Good meal and not at all pricy."}
{"text":"Good gracious I could eat here everyday!! Awesome environment, great food and a definite must go!!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice, very happy each time. Don't skip out before dessert, it's worth every bite! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"We heard about this place thanks to Triple D on Food Network and we took the bus to get to it.

We shared the crab and artichoke dip to start then I had shrimp po'boy followed by a chocolate dessert. Their specialty dessert seems to be sweet potato pecan pie. 

Great food, good wine and service.

This Cajun / creole place is really good. 

I know a lot of visitors to Vegas never venture beyond the strip but you're missing out on a great spot here if you're into Cajun food. It was pretty busy the night we went and it was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Catfish & Grits, Shrimp Charlotte, Sweet Potato & pecan pie, Bananas Foster Bread Pudding... Fabulous food, everything was great! Service was really good & the old building was a perfect setting. Definitely going back. Can't wait to try everything else."}
{"text":"Best cajun restaurant in vegas!    I went after shopping at the fashion outlet down the road.  I had a hard time deciding what to order because every item on the menu looked interesting.  Crab cakes were delicious and meaty.  The jambalaya was good and flavorful.  The Shrimp Charlotte was good but the noodles tasted and even smelled like instant ramen.  Wierd.  Overall, I had a very good experience.  The extra friendly waiter was more than helpful.  Hopefully they'll have happy hour soon so I can sample more of their menu."}
{"text":"Really liked all the Cajun decor when you first walk in. Greeted immediately with a smile and then was seated. Started with the craw puppies. The only thing I liked about these was the dipping sauce. Craw puppies are a completely wasted ball of mushy flavorless blah. Went on to try the beans and rice dish. The sausage had great flavors, but had a stingy portion control on them of only four pieces. For a dollar or more the portion was doubled. Ended the meal with the Jack Daniels sauced bread pudding. Great flavors and was very delicious. Friendly customer service with a smile. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Holy crap is all i have to say! The food here is so dam good. I have never had Cajon food before, I've only read about it but everything I read this place is way more than what I've read! I love this place, it gets me to my happy place!"}
{"text":"I think this place is a good example of a restaurant that tries to mimic a certain ethnic food but falls short.  everything about it is just a little off.  we started with the broiled oysters.  they weren't offensive but they were very small and completely forgettable.  and, our meals came out within 15 seconds of our starter.  that's fine for Tuesday night but not when you're going \"out to dinner\".  I want to enjoy the experience and I expect more out of even a mediocre restaurant.  for dinner I reluctantly had the red beans and rice.  here's where I think the place really fails.  the dish is topped with kielbasa.  just weird.  also, it's topped with only a sliver of sausage.  it was laughable (in a bad way).  I will say, the flavors of the dish were pretty good.  i also tried the blackened chicken.  the chicken was cooked nicely but the flavors were pretty one dimensional.  I finished with bread pudding which was also pretty good but there's a lot of good bread pudding out there.  the beer selection is limited and not well thought out.  that being said, the place is always packed so more power to them."}
{"text":"It's was really good.  We had the catfish and grits.   The grits was so good luke mashed potatoes.  The boiled oysters where good.  The Etouffee with rice was good also."}
{"text":"Ummm...I thought the food was OK. I cook out of Chef Paul Prudhommes Louisiana Kitchen and was hoping for that level of food here. Maybe I am being harsh, but the Crawfish Etouffe just didn't have that much depth to it. The domineering flavor was black pepper. I ordered the crab cake appetizer and it was meh. I also ordered the banana foster bread pudding. The bananas were not cooked, they were raw. With so many choices in the restaurant world, I doubt that I would go back."}
{"text":"Seen this place on DDD food show & so my husband & I went to check it out, not what I expected. Restaurant was tiny, I can deal with that, hostess didn't greet us & the waitress took forever to take our order. Ordered our food, that ruined the entire night. Our food tasted like burnt oil, or as if they didn't changed the oil out. Maybe next time we will try it again but try to come earlier when they have a fresh batch of oil."}
{"text":"After taking 3 friends to see Sandy Hackett's Rat Pack Show at the Sahara, I passed on the chance to have them buy a buffet dinner at Paris Las Vegas.  Instead, I was off to Lola's in search of some Cajun cuisine and I got it!

I started out with the craw puppies, followed this with the bronzed cat fish with smoked gouda grits and andouille sausage,.  Finally, I had bread pudding for dessert.

Everything was excellent.  Service was a delight, the restaurant is small and quite comfortable, and the food was delicious.  I saved some of my garlic bread to soak up the spicy juices left in the bowl after I finished the cat fish and grits.  I thought it would be unseemly to lick the bowl clean.

Lola came to the table and introduced herself.  She was wearing a Saints blouse.  She's quite a lovely woman.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Saw this on DDD and had always wanted to try a po boy so I was excited to eat here. We were sat upstairs in an actual hallway of the attached building. It was really loud from the box fans they had stacked up next to the door and the uncomfortable cheap tiny patio set we sat at was just awkward. Safe to say the ambiance was farrrrrr from good (I would've rather taken it to go to be honest). We tried it brush it off and enjoy the food but it just wasn't very good. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip, it was too fishy smelling and bland. For entrees I had the bronzed shrimp po boy and my husband had the roast beef po boy that was featured on the show. Mine was sooooo salty I couldn't eat it. Not good. My hubby's wasn't that good either, maybe mediocre at best. I did like the albita(?) Amber beer though lol. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing because it has a lot of great reviews. Don't think I'll come back to find out though."}
{"text":"I'm sorry Lola's - I wanted to like you, but I just can't. Downtown is my hood and I'd love to see a wide variety of restaurants flourish, but you've got some work to do.

The location inside the rehabbed Holsum Bread Factory is fantastic. Cool neon outside, nifty factory-like architecture inside. It's also walkable from all of the residential buildings downtown (although a bit of a hike from my beloved Ogden).

I just simply wasn't impressed with the food. It's better than a French Quarter tourist trap (Pere Antoine, I'm looking at you!) but I found my jambalaya uninspired and dry.

It's been a while since I've last been, and I think a return is in order. I'll try something different next time and hopefully I'll be able to revisit this review with more positive feelings."}
{"text":"I recently tried Lola's for the first time during lunch with a few friends. I am a huge fan of cajun/creole food, and Lola's did not disappoint! 

We tried the gumbo and the crab/artichoke dip to start, both were awesome!! I am usually not a fan of any kind of spinach/artichoke/cheesy mess of a dip, but this was AMAZING. It was full of crab meat and was seriously delicious.

They also have Abita beer which is a huge plus-it brings back crazy nights in New Orleans and it goes down great with the spicy food! 

We all had po'boys, blackened and fried shrimp and the roast beef one. The blackened shrimp was bomb-spicy but not overpowering ( I accidentally poured on too much habanero hot sauce but it was still delish) but if you don't like mayo-request for them to skip it. The sweet potato fries were great as well.

But BEST of all-the service! I think her name was Cristal? Nicole? Ehhh I may have still been drunk from the night before but she was an awesome girl and kept our drinks full and put up with us. Major win in my book! Even other members of the staff would walk by and keep an eye on the table, even overheard me talking about a straw and was quick to offer me one out of no where! I had a great lunch and will be back-and will definitely tell others to check it out!"}
{"text":"Guy Ferri definitely was right about this place. The food was amazing, they served a plethora of Louisiana traditional dishes. Like Ettoufee, shrimp and grits, deep fried soft shell crab and gumbo... I personally tried the deep fried soft shell crab and the hot BBQ shrimp; I rate both dishes a 10. The decor represented a warm Louisiana feel. They also served a number of great desserts, such as bread pudding, banana fosters, and Louisiana chocolate cake.  Plus the customer service was excellent. I would definitely suggest this restaurant to my friends and family."}
{"text":"My husband & I figured that if this pace was on DDD it had to be good, right?!?! Not really that great! When we walked in the door they weren't really that busy. They were more concerned about sitting us at an empty table for 4 than anything else (they had 6 empty), because after all they save those for larger parties. First come first serve!!! The environment was ehh soso, kinda small & packed in.

First off the food was quite expensive for my taste. My husband had a Blackened Shrimp Poboy that was way to spicy for me to even try since he knows my threshold for spice. He however said he enjoyed his sandwhich, not to the extreme of the price that they charged for it. I ordered the fried catfish platter with my sides of green beans and greens. Never had I been so disappointed! I have never had to salt my food so much at a restraunt before. Both sides were boiled with bacon & I think that was it. NO FLAVOR!!!! The fried catfish in part was ehhh, ok. It was a tick cut of fish, oh did I mention you only get one filet!!! The breading was bland, had no seasoning in the cornmeal & when I got my food the entire bottom side of the fliet was SOGGY!!! nothing like eating a bland soggy piece of fish that had no flavor! I have had WAY better in this town. 

The only good thing that came out of this place would have to be their Sweet Tea. The Craw puppies as an appitizer was pretty tasty, but I have had chicken nuggets bigger than these & again the price was rediculious for the portion! I can say for sure we will NOT be going back!!!

Hope this has been helpful in anyway to anybody!!"}
{"text":"This is my happy place!! SO GOOD!! Been to Mardi gras in new Orleans a few times and thus place brings back great memories! Crab cakes are definitely a must. The shrimp po' boy is BOMB!! I still haven't tried their crawfish boil, but am dieing to. Everything is so amazing. This is a spot everyone should try when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall place.  Grilled oysters are very good. .. shrimp and grits were fantastic. .. Chef Hans has a great thing going here. 

Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"My wife works at World Market Center and has been raving about this place for the past year.

We went there for dinner tonight.  We started with the crawfish puppies.  They were a little spicy (chili powder spicy, not hot pepper spicy).  They were very tasty and the spicy mayonnaise aioli is great.

I had the shrimp and grits with sausage.  I can see why it is a Lola's favorite dish!  The grits tasted like they were made with cheese and sour cream and melted in my mouth.  The shrimp had great flavoring.  The sausage was not too rich and complimented the grits well.  I added a bit of Louisiana hot sauce and it was very delightful.

My wife had the crab cake dinner (she usually gets the crab cakes when she goes to Lola's).  The crab cakes were very tasty; the spices and meat were mixed well so one did not overpower the other.

Our dinners cost $13 and $16 dollars

My wife had the Abita light and I had the Abita Amber, from Abita Springs, LA.  We are now fans of Abita beer!  Oh, and the beers only cost $4.5, not bad for a microbrew while eating out.

My wife has raved about the Banana's foster for months; we skipped it tonight though to have more beer. 

I am a fan of Lola's; it is Tuesday night and my wife got the last table for two; the rest were reserved and that should tell you all something!"}
{"text":"Hoooya! Just like back home on the bayou!  Great food, great bar, great music, great vibe, great time! The bronzed catfish and grits is so good you'll need to slap someone...twice! Be sure to have Dominick make you his 5 star Sazerac and you'll be transported right to the old Roosevelt itself - just like dat.  I ain't lyin'. 

Lola's is the best N'awlins cuisine in Las Vegas, and just maybe west of Baton Rouge.  You gonna love it - I GUARANTEE!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  That's all I need to say..  It's a small little place in the middle of nowhere.. They have the most authentic cajun food. Desserts are a must.."}
{"text":"Finally got to visit Lola's tonight for our date night. Made a reservation just to be sure. I'm glad the rain didn't stop us from coming over because this is an awesome little place!

It is very small. The tables were very close to one another, I could have stolen a few sweet potato fries  from the couple sitting next to us :). Felt a little claustrophobic at first but every one was so nice, it felt homey after a while. 

Now to the food . We had the broiled oysters and a cup of gumbo for starters. They were both pretty good although I still prefer my oysters raw. The hubby could not stop raving about the gumbo, he was reluctant to even give me a little taste. It was good, a little too spicy for me. For our entrees, I had the shrimp and grits and he, the crab cake plate. The grits was oh-so-creamy, so so good and the shrimps were cooked perfectly. I loved every bite although I thought the sauce/gravy was a little salty and that is where the sweet tea comes in to save the day. The crab cakes were beautifully presented. It was good but nothing special. We were both pretty full but I refused to leave without trying the banana foster bread pudding even ifI had to be rolled out of there(haha). It was amazing! The hubby, who dislikes desserts ate more than I did.

Our total bill with 2 beers and sweet tea is $77+ . Kinda expensive but we can't complain. Everything was good, the food was good, the servers were very accommodating, love the vibe and they even give military discount.

Verdict : We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed my night at Lola's Kitchen.  It was first Friday's so I knew there was going to be a blues jazz band playing during dinner.  The band definitely sets the ambiance for a nice moonlit dinner on the restaurant's outdoor patio.  It was quite warm, but a nice cold beer definitely fixed that factor.  The blues jazz band was amazing, and was a super plus to the environment, and the fabulous food.

For appetizers, the love and I had craw puppies and a dozen charbroiled oysters.  The craw puppeies is an awesome creation and is so good!  Crispy on the outside, and yummy on the inside.  Perfect sauce to go with it too.  The charbroiled oysters are really good too.  Just the right amount of flavor, and the right amount of cooking.  I will definitely order both the next time I come which is first Friday of October! :)

For entrees, my boyfriend had the Shrimp Jambalaya, and I had the famous Catfish and Grits.  OH-EM-GEE!  The super kind waitress told us that this was Lola's signature dish and my oh my she was NOT kidding.  I love fish, but this fish was so flavorful, and the bed of grits it lay on was perfect!  The sauce...amazing!  There were mushrooms and sausage that lay in the sauce too....perfect combination.  All together, it was an amazing dish!  If you come here, the Catfish and Grits is a definite must try.  My boyfriend's Shrimp Jambalaya was just as flavorful.  He enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed my dish.  

For dessert, we had the banana foster.  To admit, the presentation wasn't all that great, but it tasted wonderful.  I love bananas, so it was a defitnite cherry on top to my awesome dinner.  

We are definitely coming back again!  Great date night if eating on the patio, great place to get cozy with friends, or just come for really good food in a good vibe type atmosphere!  2 thumbs up Lola!!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"We had the red beans, and the gumbo all the food was excellent. The staff were very kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Had a long day got lazy and didn't feel like making anything called up Lola's for an oyster po boy.  Killer oysters great tarter actually had to take a couple oysters off because I couldn't get them in the crispy bread.  Now Im thinking of going back because Im still thinking of the sandwich the next morning."}
{"text":"Finally made it into Lola's.  

Dining here makes you feel like you are eating over at a friend's house.  It is ultra small and cramped and busy busy busy.  

Service was just fine but not great.  Our guy was definitely busy and it showed.  

Prices are fair.  Beers are cheap.  

I had the shrimp and grits.  Delicious!!  Six large shrimp and a pile of grits with bacon.  What more could you need? Oh yeah..cheese!  The grits are gouda grits.  Buttery, cheesy and yum yum yummy.  My husband said they were too cheesy.  I do not believe in such nonsense.  No such thing.  He was quite pleased with his grilled shrimp po boy and said he would order precisely the same thing when we return.  I also slyly nibbled my sisters jambalaya.  It was spicy and flavorful.  Very good.  I can't imagine there is any better Louisiana style cooking in Las Vegas.  

Maybe the best part of the meal was the delightful fig dessert.  The best way to describe it is a large homemade warm fig newton topped with ice cream.  I've never ad anything like it.  It was excellent!! My fellow diners were skeptical of ordering such a wild card but it was the favorite!

Definitely worth a trip downtown!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at Lolas on 6/20th and were pretty disappointed. At first we were seated asked for our drink orders and shortly after we ordered our food but that is where the service ended. As we watched around us tables were getting bread it seemed at random and although we ordered entrees didn't see a crumb. It took 30 minutes for us to get our food and when we did it was cold. Not just the top of the food but all the way through like it had been sitting in a pot out back and they just slopped it on a plate. My husband had the Jambalya and it was cold all the way through, only the shrimp on top were hot. He said it had no flavor at all. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it too was cold like mushy paste with some hot shrimp on top. I liked the flavor but it was more like left overs I just got out of the fridge from the day before. 

My guess is they plated the rice and grits and forgot about it then 30 minutes later realized they didn't add the shrimp, topped it off and the waiter dumped it off on our table. If we were not on our way to a conference and hungry as all get out we would have complained and refused it. What made it worse is, no one came back to refill our drinks which were down to the ice the entire meal, the waiter just dropped off the food and walked off and we didn't see anyone again until we were done and ready to pay our check. 

It's a real shame because I had high hopes for this place. We love small mom & pop restaurants and this one unfortunately unless they shape up, train their staff and check their food quality before it leaves the kitchen will be seeing the doors close sooner than later."}
{"text":"Food was very decent but a little bit higher in price. Gumbo was very good and had a nice little kick of hotness. The grilled chicken was awesome and tasted perfect. Customer service was very good as well. Our searing wasn't great, due to the fact we were sitting about a half foot away from the kitchen area, which was not closed off."}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriends birthday. The food was ok. Not very authentic though. The most authentic thing there was the purple haze. The place is small and didn't have much for seating. Overall service was good."}
{"text":"We came here during our first trip to Vegas, about 2 years ago. This place is great. The service is good and the staff is friendly and helpful. They all seem to be actually happy and enjoy what they do. Let me tell you about the food...my goodness it's amazing. The grits...the gouda grits are what keep me coming back. I forgot to mention I've been here twice and I ordered the same thing both time. The gumbo with gouda grits on the side. It tasted amazing. Next, time I come here I'll order something different. I feel like when I come here, it encourages me to actually visit Louisiana. Overall, I would & will come back here again. Anytime I'm in Vegas, I make sure to stop by Lola's for some good eatin'. :)"}
{"text":"This place is quite charming, considering its location-vegas. I had the fettucine b/c I'd just returned from a daunting trip and was hungry as a cow... it was great. 

I also tried a few crawfish for the first time: they were good, but not as good as shrimp and not worth the work. Crab cakes: fantastic! I expected more seasoned hotness from Louisiana food, but a complex flavor was definitely there. 

I'll be back to try the salmon. The menu was decently priced and creative. It seems like a great place to eat (and drink) outside(are they BYOB?). I'll be back. 

Service was amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm in town & was dying to check this place out since I'd heard good reviews. My service was great & my food was delicious. The only negative is the place was packed for inside seating so we sat outside & it was cold. Next time I'll wait for indoor seating."}
{"text":"I knew I would love Lola's before I ever even visited - it's locally-owned, non-chain, downtown, and serves Cajun food! 
However, the food was a real disappointment. The fried oysters were super fishy and the texture of the actual oysters was almost kinda crumbly. Weird, but I'll let that go because maybe all fried oysters are like that?? I had coleslaw on the side which seemed to just be shreds of cabbage with none of the mayonnaise-y sauce. Seriously none and I'm not even a big mayonnaise-y sauce fan. Maybe they made a mistake back in the kitchen when they were mixing up the coleslaw and forgot to put the rest of the ingredients in? Sweet potato fries were decent. My friend got the jambalaya, and it had a weird texture, too. I only had one bite of it, but she didn't have much more.
The prices are another strike - actually they're not bad at all for dinner, but I would have really appreciated a lunch special since we were there for lunch. It came out to over $20 each with our meal, a soda, and tip.
Overall, I'd give it 1 star, but I so want to love a local place downtown with a cute patio that I'm giving it 3 for now and hope to go back to try some of the other dishes (gumbo seems to be popular?)."}
{"text":"Eyeballs roll to the back of your head kind of good! Red beans and rice, po boys, gumbo, jambalaya, banana pudding, bread pudding, sweet potato fries, baked sweet potato... Everything is sooooo good! Make a reservation of you want to get in, eat, and get out. Great customer service, fantastic food, laid back atmosphere.,.. What else can you ask for? Ah, to go boxes!"}
{"text":"Lola's earned an additional star for prompt lunch service!  I must have loved this place because when I returned for a second time in less than 2 weeks, I was pretty excited!  

Started with the charbroiled oysters again!  Even better than I remembered.  Garlicky and delicious.  This time I figured out the sexy salad I saw walking by my table on my last visit was a Caesar salad with blackened shrimp.  I also figured out that I was going to order something more exciting than a salad!  I had a the fried oyster po boy and my man had the blackened shrimp po boy.  My po boy was perfectly dressed and the oyster breading had a peppery kick.  Still liked the blackened shrimp best but glad I tried the fried oysters.  I had coleslaw and kept stealing fries.  Their fries are really good, but I found the coleslaw a little too creamy for my taste.  I like a little vinegar in slaw.  

Come here and enjoy their little patio before it is too hot.  Kind of a pricey lunch, but oh so worth it.  Lola's is really a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Gonna keep this short and simple...tried to go out for First Friday earlier this month since we just moved to our downtown loft..but it was WAY too cold. Decided pretty late we wanted to give Lola's a try.

It was bout 9pm when we got there, it was still pretty packed so ended up sitting close to the bar.  Got some sweet teas, which were perfect, not too sweet.  Started with the craw puppies- they were okay, moist inside with a hint of crawfish flavor.

I got a salad and can't remember the name of it but it had shrimp and a roumelade sauce. Obviously it was not all that since I can't recall the dish...

The mister had the shrimp and grits- he liked it but wished he had more grits.  I tried his dish and I actually LOVED it, had great flavor but portion was a little small for the price.  I happend to agree that at least it should've had more grits.

Overall, a success and we will be back to try the other items!"}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm a connoisseur of Southern food, so I don't really know how this compares to other Southern restaurants.  But, I thought the food, in general, was good.  

I ordered the gumbo and the grits -- both were very good.  The banana fosters, which they're apparently known for, was pretty good, but not anything to write home about.  The gingerbread bread pudding (seasonal special) was excellent.  

Good restaurant to go to with a small group of friends."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about this place...wish they were open on Sundays.  Looking forward to their new location and wish they would open one on the south side of Vegas.  MmmmmMmmmm Good!"}
{"text":"Is it a problem that I have been on a five star kick?  Not really... Just been finding the gems lately.  Lola's is no exception.  The gumbo, soft shell crab, and shrimp and grits were all done nicely.  I wanted to order everything on the menu but I only have one stomach, dang.  I will be back the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lola's is a great cajun style restaurant.  We had dinner here Wednesday evening and the joint was jumpin'! The food here is well spiced, delicious and the service superb. I had a soft shell crap po boy that was outstanding. If you are in the mood for cajun cuisine give Lola's a try.  It's well worth the drive off the strip for a great meal. Free parking on site. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sencond time at Lola's, I tried a different dish this time. I had the shrimp with Gouda grits. Started dinner off with the garlic bread. My lady had the fried oyster platter with sweet potato fries. We split a side of rice and beans. Bread is very light and fluffy. The fried oysters were ok, we were expecting a lighter breading. The rice and beans are pretty good as well. My shrimp and grits are definitely the reason for the 5 starts dish is a six star dish at least. Grits are very flavorful and pungent of Gouda. The shrimp is spicy and the mushroom sauce and andouille sausage is amazing with jut the right amount of spice.

I'm going to  stop by here  more my shrimp dinner was 16 and that's one of the more expensive items on the menu."}
{"text":"Eating at Lola's was a great experience. We started off with the charbroiled oysters which were merely ok. The shells were too hot to touch, so a bit of a feat to eat. Once wrangled off of the shell, the flavor was nice. My hubby had the crab cakes which were disgusting, you can actually taste bread crumbs more than the crab. We are hard core lovers of Del Friscos crab cakes, which is a high bar to get over. My dinner however, the shrimp and grits was the shit! OMG I will be dreaming of this for many nights to come. The shrimp was cooked right, the heat was just right and the grits a cheesy delight. The sauce and sausage were so well done. It was amazing and will come back just for that. They had a great beer selection. The hostess...meh. The server was good enough. The place is small but fun. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is ALL the WOW's! From their menu items to the service! Hands down great food and great service! 

Personal favorite is their Jambalaya, Gumbo, and Crab Cakes! --- Such good food!!! Their Raspberry Iced Tea makes you dance a little its so good. The wait staff from bartenders to the hostess to the waitresses/waiters are all friendly and helpful! NO ONE is a robot.  It's just good people representing great food. 

My boyfriend and I found this great place on the Diner, Drive-In, and Dives app. Now EVERY TIME we go to Vegas this is our first stop to calm our nerve from a 4hr drive."}
{"text":"Great food friendly service. We enjoyed the red beans n rice with sausages. Also the dessert is awesome some banana faucer. Very good. I don't hand out 5 stars. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The Soft crab sandwich was really good but I felt it was a lil too much bread. The shrimp dish with grtiz was soo tasty and a lil on the spicy side. The portions are enough to make you full. The price is a lil expensive but its worth it. The dessert was decadent!! 
The area is close to downtown and premium outlets."}
{"text":"During my last trip to Vegas, I had to stop and try Lola's.  Another Triple D joint.  Plus it's New Orleans cuisine which I love. 
  
Since Lola's was on Triple D we decided to go after the lunch rush.  Triple D dives are notoriously busy after being aired.    
  
Lola's is a nice and quint place. The décor is purely Louisiana flair, all things New Orleans are on the walls and hanging from ceiling.  As you walk in there's a small two or three person bar on your right and the dining area straight ahead, which appears to seat about 25-30.  
  
There were a few people still seated from lunch and a couple arriving after we had been seated at our table.  Considering they had just finished lunch rush, the empty tables were clean and ready to be seated.  
  
The menu has all the standard New Orleans fair, as it was around lunch we settled on a Shrimp Po Boy and I had the Soft Shell Crab Po Boy.  
  
Our waiter was very attentive and friendly along with a waitress who wasn't busy at the time we sat down.  Between the two of them, we were very well taken care of without actually being hovered over.  
  
I love New Orleans' food.  I go to NOLA every chance I get, two or three times a year, mainly to just eat!  So when I say the Soft Shell Crab was every bit the Po Boy as those I've had in NOLA, I'm telling you the truth, Lola's takes you right back there!  My po boy was seasoned just right and the batter was light and crispy.  Better yet, the crab was fresh!  The crab was prepared properly, so all you could taste was the sweetness of the crab.  The Shrimp PB was also a wonderful surprise.  The shrimp were medium-sized, plump and sweet. Way more than could fit between the bread halves. Once again, very fresh and lightly breaded so you could enjoy the flavor of the shrimp.  
  
I didn't get the gumbo, but the couple at the table next to us did.  The gumbo looked and smelled delicious.  So next time, I will be getting some gumbo.  
  
The prices are very reasonable. Especially considering the freshness of the seafood and French bread which is flown in.  
  
Triple D didn't let me down, Lola's is off the chain!  And I will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited this place earlier in the week, lets just say it didn't quite meet my expectations for Soul Food. The prices are good, food meh. My daughter and I had to send our meal back, meat was undercooked. I had the chicken and she salmon. We told our server to have it prepared Extra Well, that way we could ensure that it was cooked thoroughly. Its so disappointing to bite into chicken and its like biting on a eraser, and fish to taste like it came straight from the ocean to your plate. I have a weakness for sweets, so I ordered the Pecan Sweet Potato Pie. This was $6.99, which didn't bother me, Im expecting a really nice portion. Why I get a SLICE of a slice of pie! REALLY!! And it wasn't all that. The sweet potato filling wasn't even sweet, and the crust of the pie, guess what?? Yup not cooked. I was so disappointed. To each its own, but I want be returning. Go to Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great Cajun food off the strip.  The main entree was very good...I had the bronze catfish and with Gouda grits. My partner had the soft shell crab po-boy...amazing!  The crawpuppies were small...skip it.  The gumbo was good but not amazing.  The service was good and friendly.  There's plenty of parking.  This isn't a big place, but not small either as you can sit outside.  The pumpkin bread pudding was awesome!  You won't find better food in \"The Quarter\".  We sat at the bar and got a flavor for the staff.  There's 2 TV's here.  It was on \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\"."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have a deal, every time we come to Vegas we have to find at least one new restaurant to try.  I spotted Lola's coming off the 15 on our way to the Ghana store on Charleston.  I said THERE, I want to go there.  If you blink you may not see Lola's so look for the Holsum Design Center and you will see Lola's right in the center.

Do not let the industrial area fool you, there is REAL Cajun food in there and just like a crawfish, once you get past the shell you will find just straight up deliciousness inside.  The inside of Lola's is a cozy very inviting restaurant.  The staff brings authenticity to a Cajun atmosphere.  They are friendly and they LOVE the food.  

Our waiter asked my husband what he enjoyed most in food and helped him choose the BBQ shrimp dish.  I needed no assistance, as I listened to him speak with hubby,  the passion with which he described the dishes I knew to order one of the most difficult dishes to prepare on that menu, well at least to prepare it properly, the way a true Southern chef will.  It needs experience, patience and LOTS AND LOTS of love.  Lola's has this in spades so I ordered the Etouffee.

There are a few dishes I NEVER order out, like Moussaka, Lasagna and Etouffee.  These are dishes that personify their prospective ethinicities and are rarely worth eating in a commercial setting.  Well Lola's Etouffee is as good as it gets.  As soon as I took that first spoonful in my mouth I was transported back to New Orleans and their amazing cuisine.  The crawfish perfectly prepared, the sauce was spicy and the vegetables were chunky and fresh.  It is served with rice and a basket of freshly grilled bread.  The bread dipped into the sauce is amazing.  I skipped the rice and just used the bread because it tasted to wonderful together.

Hubby loved his BBQ Shrimp dish and devoured the entire dish before I was even halfway finished with mine.  He said the shrimp was also cooked perfectly and the sauce was fabulous.  He loved dipping the bread in his sauce too.  We also had crab cakes and crawfish puppies to start with, both were EXCELLENT.  I would go back for those crawfish puppies any day of the week.

Unfortunately we were stuffed and avoiding the sugars, so we did not indulge in the desserts, but I think we will have to make an exception next time and have some.

Side note for my doggy lovers, they do accept dogs on the patio as long as they are leashed and well behaved.  Also rumor has it they are opening a second location in Summerlin at the end of the summer.  I CAN'T WAIT, they will be oh so closer to us then."}
{"text":"I've eaten at both locations, this one happens to be my favorite. Because it's small and everyone eats as one big family here. It's got a different more inviting feel. I can't tell you enough good things about my experiences with Lola's. I have celebrated birthdays, anniversary's, and date nights here. I spent a lot of time in the south as a young kid. When I dine at Lola's it takes me back to days of long past. The food will put a smile on your face until the last bite. My only small gripe is the beer selection on tap. But still I won't hold that against you. I'm humbled to have had the opportunity to indulge in this kitchens offerings."}
{"text":"Came to Lola's A Louisiana Kitchen in Las Vegas because my husband had been here before. The atmosphere is festive with all kinds of Louisiana & Mardi Gras decorations. The server was so nice and friendly--just what you'd expect from a southern place. 
It's a small place, so don't come with a party of 22 lol. Today it was just my husband and I. What this place lacks in size it more than makes up for with the amazing, flavorful and just delicious food. I have to tell you--I had the Shrimp Poorboy dressed with mayo & tartar with a serving of coleslaw and sweet tea. So flavorful and good! Wow! Party in my mouth--especially with the Crystal Louisiana hot sauce which complemented it so well. Don't use Tabasco sauce--use the Louisiana hot sauce--so much better for this dish. The breading on the shrimp was light and crispy, but not greasy at all. 
I think KeiKei B. was having an off day & maybe burnt her tongue before she came in or something because Lola's has awesome food. I was worried because of her bad review that the food wouldn't be flavorful but boy that was so wrong & way off base! I also tried some of my husband's bronzed shrimp and grits--oh my heaven! Such a rich burst of flavors! Grits had just the right bled of creamy & cheesy goodness. Sauce & sausage had s complex rich flavor that complemented the grits perfectly. The Bronzed shrimp was sooo good! Glad we shared so I could try both. You gotta try this--it's just YUMM."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. NOLA cuisine  has got to be top of my list of favorite foods I enjoy so checking out Lola's for the first time during the week excited me. Private parking here so no issues. They offer outdoor dinning but I was dinning solo and opted to sit in the bar area since they were quite busy that evening.

Started off with a bowl of NOLA gumbo which was full of yummy ingredients and had a kick to it which made my forehead break a sweat!  I followed with an entrée of crawfish entouffee which was delicious.  My friendly waitress suggested dessert and I didn't hesitate a second - chose the Fosters bread pudding which was topped with ice cream. It was awesome! 

Overall a great NOLA meal and the staff here was fabulous. I'm looking forward to returning here again and again!"}
{"text":"So I was finally able to check out Lola's.  I grew up in New Orleans and still love the NOLA food, but it is hard to find good stuff out west.  I found out about this place from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives on TV.  It looked good so I added it to my list.  It only took me a year to get down to Lola's, but I did finally get there!

We went for lunch and were pleased by the menu.  It offered a lot of yummy NOLA specialities and things I remembered from home, especially the Po Boys.  Let me tell you, nothing beats a good shrimp Po Boy in my book, so you know I ordered that!  We also got a catfish Po Boy, because that is the second best sandwich in the world, if I do say so.

Well the food came out and it was good, a little better than average, but didn't blow my socks off.  We ate everything on the plate, meaning our entire sandwich each and all of our fries, but were still a little hungry.  We didn't have time for dessert because we had a crazy 18 month old with us, so we didn't get to sample any of the desserts, which did look good, but not enough to deal with our crazy monkey.

It seems that for the price we paid for the sandwiches ($12 each) that we would have been full after eating every single scrap of food on them.  I know that Lola's imports their bread and seafood from NOLA, so I am sure that is why the prices are a little higher than I would expect, especially for Downtown.  I think it would be worth it if you got an extra piece of fish on each sandwich and maybe an extra piece of yummy Gulf shrimp to make the price a little more reasonable.  We actually were talking to a neighboring table a lot and they had the same comment about the price that we had and they had order entrees like red beans and rice and gumbo.  So the food was good, but a little high for what you actually get, in my opinion.

I would have given Lola's a 4 star easily, but our service was rather lackluster.  We were seated for 10 minutes before our server came over to us.  We had actually had more interaction from a server in the next section because my daughter, the crazy 18 month old mentioned above, was flirting with him and blowing him kisses.  I never get any attention from anyone unless she is around!  Anyway, if we had had him for a waiter, I think we would have had a better time, but our server was just swamped or something.  We hardly saw her and when we did, she seemed not to really care about us and just bothered with us.  I am not sure why because we are super nice and great tippers, oh well, her loss.

So we will probably give Lola's another shot next time we are Downtown and hopefully we get a better server."}
{"text":"My first trip to New Orleans was with a group of co-workers for ones birthday.  Well, maybe not THE New Orleans.  We went to Lola's to celebrate over lunch.  I was excited to try it.  I have wanted to for quite some time but haven't really had the chance until now.  I tried a while back and was met with disappointment as on that particular day the parking lot had absolutely zero parking spots available.  Today was another story though.  There was parking and there were many seating options outside.  So the four of us were seated under the canopy just close enough to the entrance to barely hear the music playing over the sound of traffic on nearby Charleston Boulevard.  We were asked if we had a reservation but we did not.  It did not matter on this day as we were seated right away.  It took a few minutes for each of us to decide on our lunch for the day but once we did the waitress was right there and took our orders.  I chose the Mama's Red Beans and Rice.  I was asked if I wanted extra sausage but I turned that down.  In hindsight I perhaps should have considered the extra.  My very wide but somewhat shallow bowl of food showed up with only one piece of sausage resting on the scoop of rice.  The menu says it containes andouill and smoked sausage.  Something was missing from this equation.  Regardless, it was actually very good.  The beans were tender as could be.  The soupy sauce was well seasoned with just the slightest hint of spicey heat.  The bowl of coleslaw on the side was good with the cabbage and bell pepper liberally dressed creamy style.  But the stand out for me was the French bread served on the side.  It was buttered and grilled to the point I could see the marks from the grill grates.  This gave the bread a subtle smokiness not unlike a fresh grilled burger.  No doubt it was picking up the flavors of grilled meats past.  A small scoop of beans with the lovely ham hock meat on a bite of bread was just the way to go.  Overall I am happy with my first experience.  I wish I had been given more than one slice of sausage but as a co-worker pointed out to me, I ordered red beans and rice and that is what I received.  I acn say with relative certainty that I will be back at some time to try perhaps the sausage and chicken jambalaya.  Also, the desserts sound insane.  They have bread pudding.  They have bananas foster.  They even have a bananas foster bread pudding for those who can't decide.  I am in that group of restaurant goers.  I would order that in a heart beat.  Two of my favorite desserts rolled into one."}
{"text":"First off, I am not a real Cajun/Creole food fan as I find it on the salty, fatty or bland side. Lola's, overlooking ugly and busy Charleston Blvd in Las Vegas, is simple and quaint inside, however. This is definitely not a fancy place. With Party City Mardi Gras decorations and fleur de lis decor, it has a cheesy feeling of the bayou and the Creole music is somewhat charming. We ordered apps of grilled mussels, coated in some tasty buttery and slightly cheesy topping (good, but not drop you to your knees good), white baguette slices flame grilled and a green salad, it was a decent start. The dark beer on tap was really good though, making me happy. The blackened grilled chicken I ordered was fair, again, nothing too spectacular. The people we were with commented that they enjoyed their plates of red beans and sausage, crawfish and crab cakes. My hubby had jambalaya which he said was pretty good, but not a very big serving. He finished my chicken and French fries. Entrees come with 2 sides of your choosing; green salad (literally 6-7 pieces of lettuce, 7-8 pieces of teeny-tiny cucumber fragments and I think a sliver of tomato), red beans, coleslaw, or French fries. The desserts looked good, but we shared a Bananas Foster which actually was delish! The rum and brown sugar syrup over the warm bananas and cold vanilla ice cream was tasty! Service was good, waitress very nice, wish they'd turn the AC up for the Dear, she was sweating her butt off. 
Would I return to Lola's? Perhaps, but just for the Bananas Foster."}
{"text":"Creole/ Cajun food. Lola's did not disappoint. After a little bit of research we opted in ordering the Rockefeller oysters , cajun wings with sweet potato fries , blackened catfish and grits , bronzed shrimp & grits, and fig for dessert . Boy was I starving. 

Cajun wings w/sweet potato fries : They had an option for \"spiciness\" level from 5 to 10. 5 being mild and 10 being spicy . We  decided to go with 7. The wings were delicious. It was coated in a nice buffalo flavor. Next time I'd probably go with 8-9 level. Sweet potato fries were good as well. I was starving so I kept stuffing them in my mouth . 5/5

Rockefeller Oysters: Mmm charbroiled with Romano cheese and a lemon garlic butter marinade and it came out piping hot . Sprinkled on some lemon and they were exquisite. (Don't forget to dunk the garlic bread in the remainder of the sauce . 5/5

Bronzed Shrimp & Grits: The grits were nice and creamy. Although it was a little salty to my liking , the shrimps had a Nice Spice to them. I also enjoyed the sausage that was in the dish. 4/5

Blackened catfish and grits: If you like shrimp more then catfish then the shrimps and grits are a better option. The catfish was ok , but after a few bites I was already sick of the flavor . 3/5

Fig delight  : Ohhh my goddd. I experienced a foodgasm when I put a heaping mouthful of this delicious concoction in my mouth. From the butter pecan ice cream , to the caramel, to the figs infected in a light crust...my taste buds were jumping for joy. If you're planning to get dessert , this will definitely leave you satisfied. 5/5

Overall, this place was a great option for a taste of New Orleans. Service was also really good . Would probably stop by again if I'm in the mood for Cajun food when I'm back in Vegas ."}
{"text":"Although they were closed, the owner let us sit and order. Just be warned, they seat  only until 8:30 even though it says they close at 9. 

Also, this restaurant was on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. So if you love the show as much as I do, make sure you stop in here. 

I had the crab cakes and they were excellent. All crab and no filler with Cajun spices and a good sear. It also comes with tons of salad and a delicious aoli/dressing. 

My mom had the cat fish and wouldn't share but I gotta taste of her crab cakes and they were so creamy and delicious. I could've eaten a whole plate. 

Although it took a while to get the food, it was totally worth it, and the service was very good. Especially since they let us in after their official last seating. 

We ordered the bananas foster bread pudding and the sweet potato pecan pie. Both were excellent, or so my mom says (she wouldn't share her bread pudding, too good) 

Make sure you stop here for dinner, much better than anything on the strip!"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to New Orleans then you've probably eaten in a small restaurant in an old building.  I've been to New Orleans twice and Lola's has recreated the feel of New Orleans so much I was almost tearfully sentimental.  I had the BBQ shrimp with rice and french bread which was awesome.  I can't wait to go again and try something new.  This time I'll be sipping on a Turbo Dog.  My only complaint is they are a Saints bar yet they are closed Sundays!"}
{"text":"Jambalaya cup and Shrimp and Grits plate. I have been to NOLA and this place reminded me so much of it. The bread is great too because it definitely is from NOLA. My sister and I shared both just to see if we wanted more and it was a good amount. Came out to $25. Great little lunch spot to sit outside!"}
{"text":"Having spent a bit of time in Louisiana and in Cajun country, I was excited to try Lola's.   I tried on a Sunday, and they we closed, which only increased my anticipation.  Finally, I went before a show at the new performing arts center near downtown, the Smith Center, which is an incredible venue.   We were lucky and got a seat, and ordered the oysters, crab cakes, soft shell crab and the crawfish étouffée.  The broiled oysters were OK....came out sizzling hot with a bit of cheese on top, but several were tough...I have had better in many places, but then again, I am fussy about my oysters.  The crab cakes were fine...standard fare...nothing special.  The soft shell crab was OK, and went nicely with the cole slaw....but it was not anything special.  The étouffée was really disappointing.  The roué was weak, the spicing was weak, the flavor was not well developed.  In short, it really let me down.  All I had to spice it up was Crystal's hot sauce, which is never hot enough......kind of sad.  I don't think I will go back...."}
{"text":"Had some wine and shrimp to start.  Thought the feel was very french quarter.  It is small and had a few guys just hanging out and drinking beers together.  But there aren't many tables so I could see if it starts getting busy it would be hard to handle that.  The gumbo was great!  It wasn't mush or bland.  Of course I put tons of hot sauce on it but I really enjoyed it.  I never get dessert but the waiter encourage me to and boy was it delish.  My favorite part of the restaurant was the service. The waiters were so attentive and friendly.  We ended up talking to our server for probably 15 minutes.  I will definitely go back if I'm in the  mood for some cajun."}
{"text":"This restaurant is time but it's amazing.  I had the bronzed catfish with grits.  The catfish was nice and spicy but the grits were  the greatest thing I've every tasted.  Grits and gouda together is from heaven.  The bread pudding is also very good.  Forget the strip,this is the best food in Vegas"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I ate at this place it was outrageously good and reasonably priced. I had a friend visit me from out of town and I could not wait to take her to this place. She finally relented just to shut up my bragging !!. When I went here I didn't recognize any of the staff. Uh oh...this is a bad sign!!! It's the \"little things\" that let you know about the \"bad things\". And when I got my food (a platter and Jambalaya and Gumbo 2 different salads), my worst fears were realized. Salads had way too much dressing. The rue tasted like tomato paste. Jambalaya was dry. The size of the shrimp was still on point and they were good. The catfish was overcooked and tasteless. The meal was probably a 2 low three star in actuality. But I give it a one star because I was immensely disappointed given what this place used to be like, plus after getting my friends appetite to a \"schizophrenic\" level and to be let down like this,  this place gets a one star. I hate when restaurants start out so well and (in my opinion), get greedy and start to cut corners. Oh well, another used to be good restaurant bites the dust!!"}
{"text":"I had the gumbo and my boyfriend ordered the combo platter. While my gumbo was luke warm, it was really flavorful and spicy, I loved the flavor. My boyfriend loved his plate as well. 

The atmosphere was really nice, but our waitress dropped our food off and we never saw her again. We had to eventually ask the manager for desert to go. 

I would definitely go back, and would recommend trying the \"Not your fathers root beer.\"  =)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an authentic NOLA lunch in Vegas. Charbroiled oyster where really good. Great service. Love this spot."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sucker for Cajun food. It's a little disheartening that they seem a bit scarce in Vegas. But, thanks to Yelp, I was able to discover this place.

I went here for a late dinner. The location is a bit hidden. It's a hard place to spot since most eyes look to the Holsum Bread factory when driving by. The entire place has this sort of local groove that I feel in the atmosphere. The entrance is left open to the patio, with a clear view of the downtown lights in sight. Sets a real good casual mood to accompany the meal.

I ended up ordering the bronzed catfish and grits, while the person I was with ordered the crab cake dinner. Portions are definitely not as heavy as you'd expect from Cajun food, to which I'm used to getting immense servings. I guess the focus is more reliant on quality than on quantity; which was definitely shown here.

-Bronzed catfish & grits: I absolutely loved this meal. The catfish in itself very tender, succulent and flavorful. The grits that accompanied the fish were outstanding. They were made with a smoked gouda cheese, which added an awesome twist to usual grits that I'm used to. I could see me coming back here just for this dish. The meal left me trying to clean my plate off with my spoon to get every drop out of it.

-Crab cake dinner: These crab cakes are served on top of some greens. Seemed more like a salad type of deal. After I swooped in to steal a sample from my brother's plate, I noticed a unique sweet flavor to the crab cakes.  Also worth noting is that these cakes are very crab heavy. They don't skimp you in the amount of crab they put into each cake. This looked like a very light dish though. Not something I would order if I was hungry.

-Bananas Foster: I wasn't a huge fan of this dessert. It didn't really stand out to me. I should have ordered the bread pudding, like most people recommended on here.


All in all, I was really impressed with Lola's. I do see myself coming back here for my local Cajun fix. Consider myself a new fan."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOD. YALL. This place was beyond amazing, I'm actually thankful it's not that close to where I live because ya girl would be here all the time. 

My boyfriend (Steven) and I were celebrating our anniversary and we chose this place due to a friends recommendation. Steven's from the south, so he knows all about good Cajun/southern food. Out of 4-5 different places we've tried in Vegas, he ranks Lola's as #1. 

When you walk in, the restaurant is small and the seating is close together. Honestly, it's like going to grandma or moms on Sunday for dinner, so I didn't mind the set up at all. For appetizers, we started with the Crawpuppies, hushpuppies that has crawfish mixed in. OH LORD, were these amazing. I wish there was more than 4 per order, but it's still something I'd recommended. For dinner, I ordered the Étouffée with shrimp and Steven ordered the Combo Plate with cheesy grits and greens. As y'all will see in my pictures, I definitely enjoyed my dish. It has a nice spice and creamy texture and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I've never had grits so Steven let me try his and my life hasn't been the same since. These grits are made with Gouda which provided a rich flavor to the grits that we both loved. I hope my future grits endeavors can compete with this one because the bar has been set so freaking high. 

We (or just me LOL) will definitely be back to Lola's. I loved everything about this place and hope to bring my friends here as well."}
{"text":"I came here quite some time ago for lunch with a friend. I had previously been to this locale when it was a pizza place and had been anxiousto check Lola's out.

We sat outside because the weather was nice, I appreciate the effort put into trying to create an pleasan atmosphere despite the fact that Charleston Blvd. traffic is 15 feet away.

My friend ordered the po-boy and I orrrrrdered the New Orleans style bbq shrimp. after we placed our order we waited, waited and waited for what seemed like forever. It started to get kind of hot outside and we had 5 minutes before our lunch break ended and we still had not received any food. I headed to the bathroom because I started to feel dizzy and I fainted right outside. Literally fainted. That is why I felt compelled to write this because another Yelper half-jokingly said you could faint by the time they bring you your food. 

Somehow my friend got me and all of our stuff together and we headed back to work. Later in the evening I tried my  shrimp and it was fine. The dish came with like 5 pieces of shrimp, and the dish cost like 15 dollars. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Triple D Stamped. 

Fried Oysters reeled me in. My aunt suggested this place and a fried oyster po'boy sounded good to me! Bun- super soft, lots of fried yumminess. I split a sandwich with my mom so i could have room for their famous bananas' fosters bread pudding. 

as i write this review, i just fcking realized that i didn't get their famous banana fosters BREAD PUDDING, but their plain banana's fosters. I guess i was still suffering from the 8 hour traffic jam we were stuck in earlier and maybe a bit hypnotized by the cutie server we had, but yeah, i ended up with a dessert i didn't order. I didn't love it either, but i'm sure i would have loved their bread pudding version Damn it!!! 
I guess i'll have to make my way back to get that dessert one day!"}
{"text":"We are from New Orleans, so to find a place that actually does it right in Las Vegas is such a treasure.  We have been going here for many years, we adore the owner and all her waitstaff, the food is 10 out of 10 and service is the same!  We took our doggies last night and reserved a table outside, the staff was extremely accommodating to our pets!!! It's a small patio area so might need to reserve your spot, if you plan on bringing your doggie.  Everything we order is always amazing.  My fav is the shrimp and grits!! And red beans and rice!"}
{"text":"Lola's is the bomb!  I love, love, love their catfish and cheesy grits, and their homemade desserts are to die for.  We have visited several times, and the owner often comes out to greet us. Everyone seems very personable, and the food is always fresh and well-crafted.  One of our all-time fave places to go in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Dozen charbroiled oysters.
Shrimp and grits.
Crawfish Étouffée.
Abita: Amber & Purple Haze. 

Hooks for purses at the bar. Alleluia! A woman must own this joint! ;) (those of you that don't know, Lola IS a woman, lol). 

I just took my medication so if this review is all over the place, you now know why, ha! My favorite part of the meal was the shrimp and grits. Grits were creamy with a smooth texture that complimented the shrimps that sat on top of them. I was pretty disappointed on the shrimp to grits ratio, I would've rather have had more grits on my plate. 

Our last visit was quite a disappointment, we had sandwiches that tasted quite disgusting, I forget what it was called, garbage or something, and really, that's what it tasted like. The last time that I had the étouffée it tasted a little burnt and wasn't much of a fan but this last visit changed my mind on a lot of things, for the good :)

TIP: They're a small restaurant and get really busy so I'd suggest to make reservations. Being on the Food Network will do that to a place ;)"}
{"text":"THE REAL DEAL! If you're craving New Orleans food and you don't have a private jet, hit Lola's! 

She is from Louisiana and all the recipes are hers. She flies the bread (which is the best) in from New Orleans and it is my favorite part... Makes me want to hear some Blues! 

The ambience is real and the Music is down home New Orleans Blues, Cajun, Creole, etc. 

My favs: the crawfish boil, the shrimp and debris po boys, the shrimp and grits, the \"craw puppies\", the banana pudding and the shrimp salad with remoulade sauce. OMG! Fabulous! 

The service is friendly and Lola is a wonderful person! She makes you feel like family! We love her!"}
{"text":"I think this place was A LOT of hype. We ordered basic items that you typically cannot go wrong with in a southern or in this case \"Louisiana style\" kitchen. I ordered shrimp and grits while a friend of my opted for the catfish platter. 
The shrimp were the star of the show for my meal, they were seasoned beautifully and tasted great. However, the grits were a huge disappointment, I ordered this plate for the grits especially and they were caked in some overly creamy and slightly tarte cheese that made them incredibly hard to enjoy on there own. The sausage around the grits were boring but helped the flavor of the grits when eaten together. We had sides of greens which were dry and incredibly tarte. The potato salad was simply okay. 
The catfish my friend ordered was pretty good, but definitely overpriced ($14.50) for one piece of fish!"}
{"text":"Ive been here so many times and never noticed how quick the food comes out until this visit.....Im not sure where they cook their food....it was pre-made food frozen beening taking to the kitchen in ziplock bags/ tin foil pans. I HATE POTLUCK because I just do not trust other people's kitchen... and that's the feeling I got....sorry just saying. Lola's it's been nice but I'll never be eating here again."}
{"text":"After our initial, somewhat disappointing visit to Lola's in 2010 and countless drive by's in subsequent years, I had hunger pangs for some hearty Creole/Cajun food and decided to stop by Lola's last night.  After a simply delicious serving of étouffée, wonderful service and a great time, I can say that each visit to Las Vegas will now include a stop at Lola's."}
{"text":"Love the gumbo and the poBoys are spot on! I highly recommend this spot for authentic N'walin flare. Triple DDD Guy F. gave this spot high marks and I so agree. I gave it  4 stars cuz we had to wait for our food for awhile. But it was well worth it after I saw the big portions and the pasta alfredo was succulent and savory. Hmmm-Hm! Will go back for crawfish served only on Fridays and weekends. Luv our waitress with her southern accent! This place deserves another comeback y'alls!"}
{"text":"Great food!! I knew when we were in the right spot when we walked in for lunch and the place was packed.  This place is so easy to get to as it is located just off the interstate with a nice big parking lot in the back.  I had the red beans and rice with sausage that just melts in your mouth.  I would definitely stop here again next time I'm in the area.  The only negative is that they don't have a lunch menu, so you order dinner size portions.  We really wanted to try the jambalaya, but weren't up for that much food."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  The shrimp and grits is to die for and the bread pudding is the best I've ever had. Be careful going at lunchtime though...service is super slow around noon."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a place like Lola's in Vegas since we moved here last year. What a great place!! Excellent food! I had the shrimp creole and my husband had the bronzed catfish and grits and we both shared the garlic bread for an appetizer. Great service, good ambiance, small but lively enough to be cute and fun. We would highly recommend Lola's."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! Make a reservation & go. The shrimp & grits is so flavorful and delicious. We also had the crab cakes - great starter. Comes with some salad so u get a bit of greens. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been to Lola's 3 times, Loved the gumbo me homesick. The bread had a great smokey smell.  The parking lot is a little tough, it's packed, can't wait for them to open up the Summerlin location."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is great. Awesome New Orleans style dishes. The grilled bread is the best and great for sauce dipping. Love this place."}
{"text":"Stopped through on my way to Ft. Worth. The ribeye chicken fried steak was good, but the sides were very mediocre and I also felt like a terrible human after I left and almost took a chicken fried steak induced nap behind the wheel post lunch. Probably the best food option in town though..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great Louisiana Cajun cuisine, this is the restaurant of choice in or out of Louisiana. They make oysters the way it should be made: grilled on half-shell with a little seasoning and topped with Parmesan cheese. The catfish and grits are a delicacy that must be tried. This is an absolute fabulous restaurant with an amazing staff. Shout out to Ruth...you made my entire Las Vegas experience worthwhile with your kindness and attentiveness!"}
{"text":"The small bistro ambience, and deep green plaster walls give you a big easy Bayou feel that is hard to find in our valley filled with oversized eateries. The Nola-flown crawfish and french bread add to the authenticity.  Delicious shrimp and grits and Etouffee, although entree portions run a bit small by true southern standards. Saves you room for the pecan sweet potato pie with Chantilly cream, a second-line parade all its own."}
{"text":"Well, there's no 3.5 stars, so I'll give this a bump as it is definitely better than an \"A-Ok\". 

Walked into the place early and without reservations. I ordered the Roast Beef Debris po' boy and the Banana's Foster Bread Pudding. I got the po' boy dressed and the roast beef was tender. Drizzled with a brown gravy, it made for a savory topping to go along with the lettuce, tomato and mayo. Not your typical roast beef sandwich. It's moist and delicious.

Now for the Banana's Foster Bread Pudding. Served with a big scoop of french vanilla ice cream. It's not as sweet as one would expect. Moist and tasty topped with a caramelized sugar. The one problem I had was that the sugar wasn't caramelized enough and still had that gritty texture."}
{"text":"I'm a New Orleans native who recently moved the Las Vegas. I was curious how authentic Louisiana food would be in the west so I decided to give it a shot.

As soon as I walked in I felt like I was back in the Big Easy. A Saints country sign greeted me as well as Abita beer signs, Mardi Gras decorations, and the delicious smell of southern cooking.

I had the shrimp and grits for my lunch. The grits were perfection and the shrimp were cooked just right with lots a spice.

Friendly staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"On Dirty Dining!!!!! And I fucking ate here. Gross as fuck!!! Over 30 violations if I recall right."}
{"text":"Just finished an AMAZING Authentic Louisiana meal!!!!  For appetizers we had the Gumbo and Crawfish Puppies.  For dinner I had the Bronze Shrimp and Grits, my husband had the étouffée.  We are now finishing off with Bread Pudding!!!  of course ;-)  It was like being back in New Orleans.  (I think I gained 5 pounds just now) 8-P. Worth The WEIGHT!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great food experience! We love our favorite server Meagan, but we like all the servers and employees at Lola's. The food is always fresh. Amazing oysters, the gumbo is perfect, and their catfish is cooked to perfection. The grits are excellent with anything. Delicious greens, and red beans and rice are fantastic. Don't leave without trying the fig delight! Sinfully delicious served warm with a praline ice cream on top. Always look foward to coming back."}
{"text":"Great Cajun food. Try the bbq shrimp plate. Excellent. Only thing was not enough food but the flavor was awesomeness."}
{"text":"OMG absolutly awesome . Make sure to have Lisa take care of you and Makayla cook for you . This place is the real deal , a must on the list . Thank you ladies for a great meal and so much fun . Cheers"}
{"text":"A little slice of Louisiana right here in Vegas. I lived in Louisiana for almost two decades and I've been to every corner. Sometimes I get homesick and need some good eats to get me through. I think I just found my spot. Lola's is centrally located at I-15 & Charleston. Plenty of parking around the side. Not very many tables, and the place was full. Our waiter's name was Brennan. He is not from Louisiana, but he has eaten at Brennan's in New Orleans. The smells had my mouth watering while we were deciding what to order. My girlfriend and I ordered a large bowl of gumbo and a large bowl of Shrimp étouffée. Presentation was pleasant. Gumbo had okra. I prefer filet gumbo. After discussing the differences with Brennan, he brought out some filet powder for me. Nice touch. I added a little for taste hoping not to make it too thick. It smelled like sassafras.  Both dishes were really good. The gumbo had some odd taste that I could not place. Perhaps it was the sausage. I don't think they use andouille. Étouffée is not my favorite but this étouffée tasted like the gumbo I was hoping for, and it had five huge shrimp. Between these two dishes I would recommend the étouffée. Forget the name and imagine it is gumbo. We watched other people's food. Next time we will try the shrimp and grits and the jambalaya. The jambalaya was red like New Orleans style (not like momma makes it). We were full but ordered banana foster for dessert anyway. It came with vanilla bean ice cream. It was light and airy. I was hoping more for thick and rich, but it was pretty good. Even had some small vanilla flakes. The bananas were just right. The brown sugar butter was runny and alcohol was overpowering. I enjoyed it, but will probably try the bread pudding instead next time. Two big bowls and a dessert came to just shy of $40. A bit pricey, but worth a little piece of home. I know better places in Louisiana, but pretty darn good for Nevada."}
{"text":"This place is so great. Had grilled chicken Po boy and it was awesome. Coleslaw good and bread is the best. Can't wait to try something else!"}
{"text":"Damn, I love this place! Once again, go in with an open mind to try something else on Lola's delicious menu.  I'm a complete and utter failure!  Blackened shrimp po boy again.  I also had a few bites of the sweet potato pecan pie with cream this time. Ummm, yeah, the entire meal was melt in your mouth, get you excited, break a sweat, hot all over, eyes rolling back, YUMMY!! Almost better than sex. Mmmmm! Get some..."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with my family for my brother's 21st birthday. He was really feeling seafood, and we were already off the strip, so Urbanspoon lead me to Lola's . . . and EVERYONE loved it! I've only been to New Orleans once, but felt confident in recommending the barbecue shrimp and the shrimp and grits. Everything we got was incredible - apps, beers, meals and desserts. 

Our server was incredibly nice and offered some great advice. I live close enough to Vegas that I go a few times a year - this will be added to my \"must go back every time\" list!

Thanks for an awesome meal and experience!!"}
{"text":"A little about me because this is important to the review (everyone is biased through their background, right?):

I'm a southern Californian who is a self-proclaimed foodie. I refuse to eat bad food.  I'd rather starve.

We came here after picking up a couple of friends from the airport.  It was roughly 3:30 by the time we arrived in the PM, and we were all STARVING.

I was good; I ordered a blackened catfish with some sides.  All my other friends ordered ALL kinds of stuff.

What I love about this place:

1.  I know this is weird, but I love the fact it was small and crowded. Very divey.  When you think Vegas, you think ambiance and to me, it's just too snooty.  I love that this place is totally anti-Vegas.

2. THE GRITS.  Whatever you do, get the grits as a side.  Among our company was a young lady who went through her undergrad in NOLA, and she said those grits are NOTHING like anything she had back in the South - THEY WERE BETTER.

3.  I just remember everything tasting great.  Seriously, just GREAT.

What I didn't love about this place:

4.  Well, it's definitely OFF the strip.  You have to really be looking to get to a place like this.  Doesn't seem to hurt their business, though!  ;)

5.  It is NOT ideal for a big group.  This is a great place for maybe 4-5 people tops.  We had 5 with us and I felt very caged in here.  It's a double edge sword.  On the day we went, I didn't mind it.  If I was in any more of a bad mood, it would not be cool with me.

6.  The fried platter was a bit bland.  My friend ordered that and I literally ate almost all of it.  I was really hungry and she wasn't even though she ordered this huge plate!  Ha!  It was a'right, but nothing spectacular.  It carries with it a higher price tag, too, considering how much seafood you're getting in there (that's fair, I suppose).  I just didn't think it was great."}
{"text":"What a huge dissapontment!  Ordered two Po'Boys ( grilled chicken and grilled shrimp).  The bread although soft was a bit dry and the quantity and quality of the ingredients inside are a disgrace to New Orleans cooking.  My shrimp po boy literally had 6 pieces of shrimp in it and didn't come dressed which I asked for.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing?  I bumped up the rating one star for the salad (nice fresh greens and a spicy dressing which I realy liked and the coleslaw; although I didn't think it warranted a $1 add charge.   
Unfortunately Lola, I won't be coming back.  
BTW- This is the second restaurant on the show DDD that I have been greatly dissapointed in."}
{"text":"Searching for something not on the strip and found Lola's. Being stationed in Louisiana and having a wife from there, we had to check it out to see if it's authentic. She has the combo platter, 1 nice size piece of catfish, 1 crab cake, 2 oysters and 2 fried shrimps. Sides were mixed vegetables and baked sweet potato. I had the shrimp and grits. We also had a bowl of gumbo and some greens. The gumbo was very good, spicy on the back end. Only wish it had at least 1 shrimp. Shrimp and grits were good and a little spicy also.  Someone ordered the catfish and grits and it looked real good."}
{"text":"Great banana foster bread pudding!  Fast and friendly service. Save this one for next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"I went to Lola's with a girlfriend during lunch time and it was PACKED! Although crowded with the lunch time rush, we were seated quickly. The wait for the food was a bit longer than I expected, HOWEVER when the food arrived it was EVERYTHING. I had grilled chicken breast, which was very moist, that came with the yummiest of sweet potato fries! Looking forward to going back to Lola's on a weekend when its a bit less crowded."}
{"text":"Went last night to have dinner. The service was great and all staff members were kind. They didn't take too long to bring our food out. I would tell all my friends and family about the great food and service I had. I will be visiting more often."}
{"text":"Pretty cool to be off the strip. Seems like a hidden Vegas gem,which is what I like. I ordered the shrimp pasta, pretty spicy but seemed a little bland. Like it were missing something...
Definitely want to check them out one more time to try another dish. Shrimp and Grits is what my GF got, that was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Oh my....fabulous, fabulous..husband had jambalaya and loved it...I had shrimp with grits, it was amazing!!! good cold beer, ending with excellent bread pudding...would come back every week if we lived here!!!"}
{"text":"We had just come from New Orleans so were skeptical of the reviews.  But WOW!  We were not disappointed. It's a small, unassuming place and they don't seem to spend any money on redecorating. But that's not really important, is it.....  everything about this place is terrific. It started when we wandered in the front door and were greeted by the hostess. And then by every staff member we encountered. This is a friendly place!  We sat within view of the kitchen door and that only reinforced how impressed I was with this restaurant. Our server was a very friendly gal who was knowledgeable about the menu and beer choices. To make this place even more authentic, they serve Abita Springs beer.  We had the crawfish étouffée and shrimp creole, both of which were outstanding. Although the menu has many, many tempting choices, we agreed that we would return here just for these two items. 
Out of the thousands of restaurants in Vegas, this place is in the #20 position, and for very good reason. What a great experience, at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"First time, but will be back again! Food was great. Look forward to trying new meals each time!!"}
{"text":"Oh Lola's I love you so! My husband planned a surprise dinner for me, for which we had a party of about 20. The dining space is incredibly small so if there is a large party such as ours on the day you want to visit, you'll probably be waiting for some time if you don't have a reservation. I was expecting the service to be subpar for such a big group in this place with 1 server allotted to us. But Lisa took great care of us! The bills at the end were right the first time and everyone's food came out exactly as ordered!! I ordered the fried shrimp platter per usual with a side of Gouda grits (DO NOT MISS THE GOUDA GRITS). This place has remained one of my favorite restaurants in the valley for about 4 years. The second location on Town Center is MUCH bigger and the food is just as good, so I'd go there if I didn't have a reservation."}
{"text":"After a long grueling morning of meetings with the team, we decided to call it a morning and grab lunch! Our regional director was in town and wanted to go somewhere decent. Our boss suggested Lola's. I have to admit I was really looking forward to it. Nothing like good Louisiana food. We started off with the oysters. No complaints. I love oysters and these bad boys were on point. The course was the Catfish and Grits because my boss raved about it. They were okay. The fish was very jello in its texture. Maybe I haven't had catfish in forever but that's not something I remembered about it. The grits were okay. Overall, I wasn't so satisfied with my meal but I do intend to return to try the jumbolaya. Will update this when I do. Overall, nice place and nice staff. Tricky location to find, you have been warned."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place as I'm visiting from out of town and wanted to find a place off the strip. It was a bit disappointing. 1sr we ordered the hot crab and artichoke dip. The waitress said it came with crab, artichoke parmesan and cream cheese. But all we tasted was warm cream cheese. It was a no for us. When it came time to order, my mother got the catfish platter with the greens and French fries, I got the platter  (catfish, shrimp, fried oysters and a crab cake) with green beans and French fries and I got my daughter the chicken strips and French fries. The catfish and shrimp were amazing! So good. The oysters, French fries and greens were salty. Like overly salty. My crab cake was good too. A bit spicy and I loved it. But the highlight had to be the green beans. They were seasoned perfectly and had tons of bacon. Oh and my daughter gobbled her chicken strips. I will be back cuz I believe in 2nd chances and the food that was good, is worth giving another shot"}
{"text":"Great food! Our waitress, Lisa, was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. We had the charbroiled oysters which where excellent. My wife had the Crab Cake Dinner and I had Tchoupitoulas, both were fantastic. When you come to this restaurant you have to have the Grits they are  awesome."}
{"text":"Food was great!!!!!! For appetizers we had the craw puppies which was a nice twist on the traditional hush puppies that you find at most cajun restaurants. For the main meal, I had the shrimp & catfish over grits and the hubby had a shrimp po' boy with a side of red beans & rice and a cup of gumbo which I must say, was probably the best restaurant gumbo we've tasted in some time. Only thing I would change is the size of the restaurant! It would be nice to have a little elbow room to truly enjoy your food and the company you're with...No way anyone should be subjected to all that cajun goodness in a small tiny corner of the restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Lola's is a friendly little Louisiana kitchen that resides in the old Holsum bread factory off the 95 and Charleston. My husband and I and I eagerly anticipated dining at this restaurant long before it opened since it is close to home and we were regulars at the restaurants of the two previous occupants, The Grill (miss those salads) and Bistro Divino (miss those pine nut cookies). I hope the third time is a charm for this location since Vegas is missing good Southern cuisine and because the owner, Lola (AKA Beth), is as sweet as the splendid sugary yams you may have the privilege of enjoying if she happens to have some on hand or if you specially order them.

I think this was our 8th or 9th time dining here since it opened last year, and although everything is pretty good, we tend to stick with our favorites. To start we had the craw puppies ($5.99), deep fried morsels of crawfish and cornmeal batter served with an addictively spicy aoli. These are a wonderful way to start the meal and a unique creation of this particular restaurant. For my entree I ordered the shrimp remoulade salad ($8.99), which is the simplest and healthiest dish on the menu, but perhaps also the most underrated. It consists of plenty of perfectly poached shrimp served on a bed of romaine lettuce, accompanied by tomatoes, quartered hard-boiled egg, and lemon wedges (be sure to squeeze them over the shrimp for the proper acidic component). The remoulade dressing made with whole grain mustard and mayonnaise really makes the dish stand out, and the salad is a refreshing antidote to the heavier items that pervade the menu. Ian got the bronzed catfish with grits ($14.99), that he always opts to have blackened rather than the aforementioned bronzed preparation. It is wonderful when you can have catfish that actually tastes good, and Lola's does an excellent job. Ian tends to douse it in the Louisiana Gold hot sauce (the real deal), but it is certainly delicious on its own. The plate hits on all cylinders, and the only change that could be made would be the addition of a bit more cheese in the grits to add some saltiness.

Even though I didn't get it this time, I would also suggest the rich and flavorful gumbo, properly prepared with a dark roux and plenty of sausage and seafood. It's a cup of Southern goodness, though you might want to ask for it extra hot since sometimes is doesn't come out the way I personally prefer which is best described as \"burn the roof of your mouth off hot.\" The baked oyster appetizer is another hit, and please don't forget to ask about those caramelized and gooey yams to round out the meal. The Purple Haze Abita beer ($4.25) is also a must to complete the experience. On the downside, I haven't been too impressed with the po-boys as they are heavy on the bread and the steak wasn't too well-received by Ian's best friend and fellow chef Jason. Boiled crawfish are now temporarily offered on the menu, however, which I anticipate will be terrific and look forward to trying next time so I can compare them to Hot n' Juicy Crawish.

It is evident from your first visit that Lola's serves up authentic Louisiana fare prepared with love and a genuine desire to make bellies happy. Although the food is not as refined as that of the late Commander's Palace where Ian used to work, you can certainly imagine it coming out of your grandmother's fragrant kitchen, should she happen to be from New Orleans. The yummy food, homey atmosphere of the restaurant, and Beth's smiling face keep us coming back time and again, and I hope we don't see any more restaurants in this space."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's like a neighborhood spot and definitely worth the trip if it's not nearby. My go to's are the catfish, Gouda grits, fried chicken salad (blackened)... everything is great, consistent and customer service stellar. Make reservations!!"}
{"text":"Great Cajun food. The staff was so friendly and helpful. And thanks to Lola for taking the time to greet us. Loved the food. I look forward to your new location-will definitely visit the next time I come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, and awesome customer service always feel welcomed whenever I come lots of Louisiana local foods---Abita beer and the bread that they serve is from a bakery in LA. Try any and everything it will never dissapoint!! I cannot suggest just one item! I don't even like cat fish but dayyyyyuuuuummmmm!"}
{"text":"I saw the soft shell crab po' boy on Yelp and had to try Lola's.....

If you have 2 in your party... be prepared to sit at an unbelievably close proximity to the neighboring table!!! I literally felt as though I was having lunch with the people sitting next to us. You can't walk in between the tables.... my husband pulled the chair out for me to sit down and then had to walk back around four other tables to sit down himself because the tables are sooooo unbelievably close to each other.

Food.... YAY!!!!
We started with the sweet tea, which is SWEET!!! I recommend for all those who are not addicted to sugar in their beverages to try a mix of half sweet and half unsweetened.

The oysters are AMAZING!!! This is a must!!!! Flavor is delicious, and a great piece of garlic toast to soak up the juice... oh yes!!!

The Soft Shell Crab Po'Boy was just as amazing as I imagined! They ask if you want it \"fully dressed\"... the answer is yes..... lettuce, tomato, onion and yummy mayo/tarter sauce. I had a side of potato salad which was good also. (I like my potato salad a little sweeter... just me..)
The Shrimp and grits are really good!!! This dish is RICH... those cheese grits are absolutely delicious... but oh so rich....DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"I love a hidden gem and this place is absolutely just that. The place is so unassuming that my cab driver passed by it. Upon walking in, the seating area is even smaller than i believed it to be. But the staff was so so friendly and helpful. They helped me get seated as i was alone with my 1 year old. 
I had shrimp and grits and i got the rice and beans for my daughter. The shrimp and grits was delicious!!! Just a bit spicy but perfectly so. My daughter liked the rice and beans. I wasn't a fan and i think that matters more cuz she's only one. I had to go for dessert so i got the bananas foster bread pudding and it was soooo good! I don't regret it. If you don't mind wondering off the strip to find this place, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"My friends that live in Vegas took me to this restaurant and I can't stop thinking about it! I got to try the crab dip and oysters to start with which were both amazing. Then I had the soft shell crab po boy! It was the most delicious sandwich ever! To end, I had the foster bread pudding! Absolutely yummy!!! I can't wait to go back to Vegas and visit this restaurant again!!!"}
{"text":"If you have never been, it's not the easiest place to find but once arrived, the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. Collectively, my group recommends the crab cakes, catfish, ettoufe, wings (level 7 hot) and gumbo.

The jambalaya and greens were not a fan favorites."}
{"text":"We tried to eat there two year's ago,but they weren't open,so we made it a point to do it this trip . So good, glad it worked out for us & family that live here. Shrimp and grits to die for, my  daughter had soft shell crab very good, desserts were delish. So glad we finally got to eat there."}
{"text":"Went there ordered catfish fried, crab cakes on tha starter (only get one) which was really good. Food was great definitely gonna try more things off menu great place"}
{"text":"First we made a reservation because after reading the Yelp reviews I saw that everyone said the place is small and seating is limited.  So I called on Wednesday and made a reservation for 4pm Saturday.  We got there early because we were done at the outlet and I was hoping they could just get us in.  Well, thank goodness that it was not crowded at that time because there was no reservation for me.....
The place is SMALL.  The tables remind me of something in the south set up in someone's grandma's basement.  Not restaurant style at all. Out table was actually a little wobbly.  But who cares, bring on the Nola food!
The food is pretty good.  I was a lil piglet and wanted to try everything.
First to start we ordered fries, garlic bread and the soft shell crab as an appetizer.  The soft shell crab was EXTREMELY small but whoever it was that brought it to our table (chef, manager, not sure) noticed how tiny it was and said that he apologized for the size and can either get us another one or let us have that one and take it off of the bill.  We'll take option #2 please considering we had never had it before and just wanted to taste it.  It was very tasty.  The fries were fresh cut and tasted amazing!!!
For dinner we ordered the Combo Platter which consisted of catfish, fried oysters, shrimp and a crab cake with sides of red beans and rice and side salad.  I ordered the Chicken with sides of Low Country Greens and Gouda Grits. Ed said the combo platter was tasty but the oysters were extremely fishy.  But the red beans and rice...to die for.  I don't like beans and wanted to order my own side of them.  They were amazing. 
My chicken was very bland, no flavor at all.  NONE.  But the Gouda Grits....OMG!  The best grits Ive had EVER!  I couldve eaten those with some turkey sausage and called it a day.  The greens were pretty good also.  
Would we go back?  Sure but it is not a must have for us."}
{"text":"Yum!  
I came back with some friends and had the catfish and grits this time. Still delicious!  
I did try the Crawpuppies and they were good.   Had some Gumbo and it was amazing, and I'm from Louisiana, so I have had a lot of Gumbo in my life. LOL! 
Also tasted someone's crab cake and really liked the lemon aioli they put on top. 
Lastly several people ordered desserts and I mooched a bit off each of the Bread Pudding, Banana Bread Pudding, Sweet Potato Pecan Pie and the Fig dessert.  
Hands down the Fig dessert was the best.  The whole table pretty much agreed. 
Now it's your turn to try it!"}
{"text":"Lola's...yum! Here's the thing about Lola's, they do certain things so right, it's 5/5 stars. But if you get the wrong thing, you'll leave unimpressed. 

Location, exit 15 north turn right on charleston it's going to be a street light and you're going to go through it and quickly turn right up towards a sign that says something about Italian bread in neon lights. It's before the next bridge. Hard to find the first time, too easy after that. 

The ambiance: pleasant, they have some metal tables out front with lights that would be fun to sit at on a spring vegas night. They view is of charleston street (a 4 lane street), but still nice to be outside. Inside is a tight squeeze. We were placed on a tiny high top table in the bar area. At first I was super bummed, but it ended up being fine since the waitress had to walk past us everytime to get bread for the other tables...so the service was very responsive. 

The food. 
Obviously the blackened shrimp and grits (15.99) is the best. Just look at the photos. They have truly sailed in that sauce that it is just delicious! Shrimp is a little over cooked if that bothers you, I would recommend the blackened cat fish it has less of the over cooked texture. 

The gumbo (12.49) is ok, they say it comes with shrimp but I spotted 2 tiny ones for my whole bowl...rest of it is sausage and okra. I will try something else next time. Probably just 2 blackened shrimp (hehe)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, I have a friend who loves this place and always brags about how great it is.  Another friend told me they had a Corned Beef special for St. Patrick's day and since we go on a quest every year to find the best places in town for Corned Beef and Cabbage, we decided to give them a shot.

We ordered a shrimp appetizer, crab cakes, and of course the Corned Beef Special.  Lets start with the Cajun style food, the shrimp dish was true to the Cajun style of spicy but was really good.  The Crab Cakes, WOW, the best I have ever had.  With all that being said there was no way the corned beef could not be good and it was better then good it was GREAT....very tender and tasty and really ranked among the best we have had.  There is only one other place out of the 7 we went to that added a really cool gravy to theirs, but overall it was amazing.  

The food here was so good we will be back not only for the food but for the friendliness of the staff as well.  Andy was our waiter and he was very patient knowing this was our first time here and was very helpful with suggestions.

Kendra the manager, one of the sweetest and kindest people I have ever met.  She was warm, friendly and just really showed me why this place has a staff with such a great attitude, it starts from her leadership.

This is a place we will come back to for the Cajun food and the prices are really fair.  I would highly recommend this place....."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight. Party of 6 and made reservations. Good thing we did as the place was packed.  The service was wonderful (Lisa was our server ) and a nice selection of beers and wines.  It was a little noisy in the restaurant as it was so full, but it wasn't terrible.  The food was superb.  We had the crawfish étouffée and shrimp Charlotte  and red beans and rice and catfish.  All were wonderful.  Prices are reasonable and nice portion sizes.   Nice parking as off the strip. We were told a 2nd location is opening end of August in summerlin.  Can't wait to go there too. We went here based on the reviews we read and we were not disappointed at all. We didn't have the dessert but we saw it and it looked amazing.  We were full from the nice sized dinner portions !!"}
{"text":"Friend asked me to make him gumbo for his birthday. Gumbo takes hours. I decided to get him gumbo and banana pudding at Lolas , yummy 
Being a native from New Orleans this is the best Cajun food in Las Vegas ! Yes sir"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place but then very disappointed by the experience.  The garlic bread tasted nothing like garlic or even butter.  My companion ordered gumbo and I ordered shrimp and crawfish etouffe. Somehow they looked and tasted pretty much the same.  Both were served in a shallow bowl with a cup of rice.  The portions were so small.  It was basically a cup of stew and a cup of rice for like $16.  It was really mediocre in flavor and needed salt,  pepper, and hot sauce for me to even want to eat it.  Both dishes were a little hotter than warm.  

I don't think I will ever go back.  It is a cool spot but the prices are ridiculous for the underdeveloped mediocre recipes this restaurant uses. Cajun food should be full flavored, like at my fave chain Pappadeaux's where they get the cuisine right!  Lola should go back to New Orleans and learn a lot more."}
{"text":"Having never been east of Utah, I can't speak to how authentic Lola's is. I can say that what we had was delicious and we will become regulars. I had Jambalaya that was outstanding. My significant other had a smoked ham sandwich that was superb."}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant before an event at The Smith Center. Their shrimp and grits and catfish and grits are amazing, as are the bread pudding desserts! I have introduced so many people to this little gem! Not 5 star because the smoked oysters, while delicious, have been on the small side lately."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Vegas and they wanted to hit some of DDD places on Guy's show.   PLEASE NOTE you've entered Saints Territory!!!  ;-)

Very small place but, we were there for the food and atmosphere.  Our server was super nice and explained everything to us.    We had:  Appetizer of the Craw-Puppies.  They were warm and cruncie on the outside.  The inside was soft but, they were packed with flavor for sue!  The sauce you dip the in was really tastey!  

 Bronzed Shrimp Po-boy and boy did the Bronzed shrimp have some POW!!!!    I wouldn't order the side of green beans again (a bit mushy),  Roast Beef Po-boy was so good our friend didn't offer us a bit! LOL   Sausage with the Gouda Grits- The sausage was very tender and not dense- had a great flavor the gouda cheese was awesome with the grits.  My other friend had a spicey Shrimp pasta dish.  Really just tasted like a regular pasta dish to me.  I would have had the shrimp bronzed... LOL 

We shared the fig dessert that came with Pecan Ice-cream.  It tasted like a warm fig pie.  We all enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go here after hearing so many things about it.  I guess because I had such high expectations, I was a little under impressed.  The food we got was good, just not amazing.  They were out of crawfish, so I will definitely go back to try those.  I had the etifoue and my husband had a shrimp and oyster po-boy.  I will say that their bread that comes with the entrees is amazing.  We had a boiled shrimp appetizer and it just didn't have any flavor at all."}
{"text":"I would have never known about this place if not for the internet (lolaslasvegas.com).  This tiny little restaurant is very charming.  I loved the New Orleans music, but I wish it had been a little more boisterous to add to the atmosphere.  I went for lunch on a Friday and by noon the place was PACKED.  Service was still great though, because there were plenty of servers on the floor.

I was able to try a few things on the menu - the gumbo, BBQ shrimp and crabcakes were pretty good but the bronzed catfish was the absolute highlight for me.  The fish was packed with flavor and the texture was like butter.  Portions were small on this entree but the quality was amazing.  The bread they served with the meal was light as air.

The sandwiches on the menu are under $10 and have pretty big portions.  The crawpuppies were also very tasty.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Lola's is in a great spot near the outlet mall off Charleston and the i15 freeway.  Been here for lunch several times and the food has always been excellent.  So far, I have had the Lola's Crab Cakes, Jambalaya with Chicken and Sausage, and the Blackened Catfish with Grits (my favorite).  There are many other items on the menu that look amazing, just haven't had the opportunity to try them all.  This is by far the best Cajun spot in town."}
{"text":"Love this spot, living downtown I'm here at least once a week to eat. Can't go wrong with the red beans and rice, or the Gouda grits. Service is always great and the gm is great! I've never left not satisfied!"}
{"text":"I always give all the stars.  This one is not going to happen.  I'm not a critic, I'm just a hungry lady.  This place is an abortion of Cajun Cuisine.

My guy & I stopped in after antiquing nearby.  We were ravenous & we adore Cajun food.  I was so excited to have a place in town to get nourished with my favorites.

We were seated & served some drinks after a spell.  There was only one poor waitress from AK there & she had 5 tables.  She came to take our order..........then we waited.......turned another decade older, then our food came.
I'm from Tenn & have lived in LA.  This chow wasn't fit for a POW.  My gumbo had formed a hard shell on the top.  So I asked the waitress if it comes from the oven.  She explained that it came from a pot.... (no kidding)  So my inner \"Colombo\" deduces that it sat under a heat lamp.  If you buy the gumbo & select shrimp, you get 3 of them.   Oh Boy, for $11-$12.99 you can get 3 shrimp on top of a heat lamp-ed dish of gumbo, Id rather stay home & eat zatarains.

Plus I found a nice big piece of bacon in my gumbo.  Now if they use that to make a roux, that's forgivable, but even then its to be crumbled.

Worst restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"The crab cakes and the shrimp and grits are sinfully good. It's busy, but not cramped. Thier chicory coffee is Cafe du Monde, my favorite New Orleans style coffee brand, and they give you a whole pot! I'm too full for dessert, but I will definitely come back next time I'm in Downtown LV!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a client. She made the Gouda Grits sound so good I had to check it out. This place is everything everyone says it is. Great food and service. It's very intimate, so reservations are a must."}
{"text":"We started with Abita Strawberry Beer on tap... Crisp and refreshing!  Hot Crap and Artichoke Dip with the toasted bread then delicious Shrimp platter half fried half blacken with Sweet Potato fries and red beans and rice amazing!  Server Bethany was a sweet and courteous!  Made girls night out one to remember!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews on this but I felt it necessary to write one for Lola's. Now let me start with the positives its right down the street from my office so its convenient, and that's about it. I ordered a crab cake for an appetizer which was mediocre to somewhat good at best and it was $7.00 for one! Then for lunch I ordered the shrimp creole which was absolutely nothing special although the shrimp were cooked absolutely perfectly.  The shrimp creole was $16.99 and only came with 5 shrimp!!! Seriously I'm only getting 5 shrimp for 17 dollars you have got to be kidding me! I wouldn't have minded if the dish was mind blowing or if it was something that I had absolutely zero chance of replicating at home but that just simply isn't true. I could make this dish at home with ease! So if I were you I would find another creole place for much better value. I'm still confused how this is the best in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"The crawpuppies are only 4 small pieces per order and it is $5.99!  They don't taste good either.  Be more generous Lola's!"}
{"text":"Red beans and rice excellent.  Oysters are decent.  The meat po bo not that good. Great la beat. Cole slaw and toast excellent.  Service was a little lacking.  Prices are ok but would expect service to be better for the price.  I'd go again, see if the improve wait-staff training."}
{"text":"Great food
Quaint little place
Would recommend for lunch or dinner
Smaller dining area
Excellent staff"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Lola's on Saturday night. He was born and raised in Shreveport, LA so he knows southern cooking. He ordered the Shrimp and Grits and was in heaven. He said this dish was as good as Brennen's in the French Quarter. I ordered the Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya and it was the best I have ever had. To end a spectacular meal, my husband ordered Mamma Deaux's Banana Pudding. He was immediately transported back to his childhood - Nill Wafers and all. At the end of our meal, Lola sat down and chatted with us and a local couple. She is as warm and welcoming as her restaurant and her down home comfort food. We will be returning every time we come to Vegas. I recommend you go early as the restaurant is small and very busy."}
{"text":"Lola's is an average Cajun restaurant located Downtown. I used to think it was a great Cajun restaurant, but after trying some other Cajun spots around town, I've had to temper my enthusiasm a bit.

My usual Cajun order is jambalaya, which is decent here. The portion size is a bit small for the price, but not exorbitant. The last time I had the jambalaya it was a bit bland and didn't have any kick. It wasn't bad, but I was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the orange salad with blackened salmon and was floored at how good it was! It had the perfect accompaniments, spot on dressing! Also had a crab cake the start, which was moist, tender and very tasty! Love this place!"}
{"text":"A sad little restaurant. The red beans and rice tasted like like it was old. The blackened catfish  looked like it was beat up and it tasted like it too. The food was just bad. Service is pretty terrible too. This restaurant is not a serious place."}
{"text":"Lola's has pretty much become a staple of every one of our Las Vegas trips. Hell it may be the meal we look forward to the most. It's one of the best DDD features we've been to so far. 

Every single dish here just feels so authentic and flavorful. From the catfish and the jambalaya to the gouda grits and the grilled shrimp, each item is memorably different from the rest of the food around and other Cajun restaurants to which we've been. It doesn't feel like the flavors are from a seasoning thrown at the end (the way places call French fries with some old bay seasoning on top Cajun fries). Instead, each dish is naturally and purposefully infused with different notes of heat and spice.

For me, the joy of this restaurant comes in the form of the shrimp Charlotte. I've never had a pasta like it, where the flavor and pasta are one in the same and no sauce at all is needed. And the shrimp are grilled perfectly. It's a dish that is intriguing all the way through and with each bite, you wonder how they accomplish so much with just angel hair pasta and if you could somehow figure it out and make something just half as good  because that would be a success. 

When you visit Vegas, go visit Lola's. And save room for dessert. I never have (can't help myself) but they rave about their bread pudding, and their descriptions only make them harder to turn down."}
{"text":"We have previously dined at both this, the original, location and its newer  restaurant in Summerlin so we barely looked at the menu before ordering bronzed catfish and Gouda grits entrees along with a side of rainbow coleslaw.   There may not have been as much catfish as in the past, but the generous portion of Gouda grits more than compensated.  The fish itself was perfectly prepared and delicious.  One cautionary note:  this is not the best choice for an intimate meal as it is small, crowded and loud."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I've had on my list for a while, but just never made it here and I regret not coming earlier! We dined here with a large group of friends a couple months ago and had a lovely time. 

I made reservations over the phone and they were very accommodating, which says a lot since it's such a small space. On that note, I highly recommend reservations for your group!

Crawpuppies ($5.29): Minced crawfish blended with spices and fried; served with housemade cajun aioli. YUM! Nothing to hate about these little puppies.

House Cut French Fries ($2.99): It's no secret that I love fries and these are AMAZING. The perfect mix of crunch and a soft interior with great flavor.

Bronzed Shrimp & Grits ($16.99): Gulf shrimp served over Gouda grits with an andouille sausage and mushroom ragout. SO. GOOD. The shrimp were cooked perfectly. The grits are DELICIOUS and that ragout really pushed the dish over the edge. 

Jambalaya-Chicken & Sausage; ADD Shrimp ($14.99): Ruben and I LOVE jambalaya and this one was no exception. Great flavors!!

The food was fantastic and so far, it's the best place I've been to in town serving up Cajun/Creole food! I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Small restaurant and I'd rather sit outside unless its too hot. The shrimp and grits are always good. Ive not had a dish I wouldnt order again. Service is usually spotty. But I'd go again at a minutes notice."}
{"text":"Quick service, great description of all entrees. Meals came out quick, flavor was so multi dimensional( had the golden shrimp and grits) left my plate clean. Great size portions. This is a place I will definitely come back to when I come back to Vegas. Better than anything I have had on the strip for the price."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place when we got there since I know the sister of the owner
We had terrible service from a girl named Katrina. 

Hank the manager was there, nice guy, but because of the disregard and rudeness my family never returned

First impressions are everything. 

I ordered the red beans and rice. 

Because of the poor service we received, I left the minimum tip, and in front of this server, I purposely whipped out a stack of $100 bills, looking for some 20's. 

Without that particular server I'd have visited more often at this location
Instead I heard there was a second
I never went, too far across town. 

Didn't care for the vibe from the waitress. You are there to SERVE ME and represent the face of a business, not to come into work with a chip on your shoulder. 
We said nothing to her, weren't rude. 
Paid the bill never to return
Sad cause I'm a Saints fan and I love New Orleans and thier inspired menu"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great cajun food with above average service. Their po boys are great and I always enjoy the étouffée plus the crappies. They have the whole range of Arbita beer plus a few on tap now. Only thing bad about this place is it is a bit small so the tables are right on top of each other plus a bit noisy."}
{"text":"The gumbo is the best. Also the grits. Definitely have dessert at the the end, the bread pudding is bomb."}
{"text":"Fan-freakin-tastic!!!! Awesome atmosphere, great wait staff and above all AWESOME food!! Must get the crawpuppies, shrimp  with Gouda grits is rock your world amazing and the banana pudding is the perfect treat to top off an amazing meal!! Hidden Gem!!!"}
{"text":"High expectation, a bit disappointing! Their idea of Cajun food and spices it seemed was just tons of pepper in every dish so your mouth would burn but not happily. Dishes were very mediocre, mmmmmm!!"}
{"text":"Red beans and rice awesome. Guoda grits good taste but thick when it cooled it became too thick. Crawfish hush puppies strong lemon and spice not pleasant. Catfish po boy great catfish flavor just 1 piece way too much bread. Free parking in a funky little lot on an odd corner. Super small place go early or wait. Filled up fast. After reading all reviews and being on DDD we expected more."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Lola's A Louisiana Kitchen. It is located in a weird, obscure place and is very small.  Parking is located a little further away from the restaurant in a parking lot. 
We ordered a basket of fried okra for an appetizer. It was delivered hot and fresh. 
Our waiter was courteous and delivered the food promptly. 
We had the shrimp and grits, as well as the shrimp creole. 
The shrimp & grits were very flavorful and I recommend them; however, be informed, you only receive five shrimp (tail on) on each of these dishes.  For the $18.00 charge per plate, surely, patrons should receive a few more shrimp and a larger portion. 
Overall, the portions are quite small. 
The shrimp creole lacked a lot of flavor and was pretty disappointing. 
With so many great choices in LV, I don't know if I'll return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere! The food was really grea and the decor was straight out of Louisiana. I have only been here once but it was an unforgetable experiance and I plan on coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Have any of you been put on the spot to find a good place to eat, that suits everybody's wants? Ha silly question. Well that's what was asked of me bu some of my parents friends visiting. I got to my trusty Yelp app, read reviews from trusty Yelpers and came across this place. Now, it can't be just any ol soul food, but I told them it had really good reviews. In the car we go and head there. Woops, it's so quick off the freeway we missed it! Take the streets and try again, a little slower this time and we found it. 

This place is literally a hole in the wall-so small. But those are usually the best ones. We were seated, read over the menu with Michael Jackson playing in the background, so singing and reading. They have a good variety on their menu, greens, potato salad, coleslaw, etc.  However, I did not see mac and cheese. I was a little bummed, but knew I would find something else. I ordered the catfish with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. Some others got the same, and 2 ordered the catfish Po-boy. Now I wait for the food to arrive, and hope it's to their liking. Reputation is on the line. Food comes out and set on the table. I take a bite of mine, delicious. I can't have catfish without dousing it in hot sauce, but it was good. The greens and sweet potato fries were done just right. I love a crispy sweet potato fry. 

Now, 1 of the 2 was picky about her soul food and when she took a bite, I just looked at her, hoping good news was to follow. She took another bite and said, \"Ok this is pretty good. I like the way they fry their catfish.\" Wahoo!  Do a little dance. I was happy she enjoyed her food, and that I could enjoy mine too, cause it was delicious. 

Would I come back? Yes, the people in there were really nice and the food was really tasty, with good music to go with it. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"lolas was just ok...luckily I have a two-try rule.  
It was my first time at this establishment.  and overall it was just OK.  I decided to treat my mom to lunch and when we walked in it was about 85 degrees in the dining room. Why you ask, the front door was perched open.  Why you ask, i have no idea...we are in the desert the last time i checked. Anywho, i ordered gumbo & a catfish poboy. Both were delish. My mom ordered the red beans & rice...she enjoyed her choice. For me a good dining experience usually means good food & good service. the food was good the service was just ok. no smiling faces when seated, no smiling face from our waiter.  Actually the only time the waiter smiled was when he asked to clear the table and I said yes. I am eager to give Lola's one more try! Next time i will bring a fan.

{"text":"Although the owners are from Louisianna, I was disappointed as my expectations were extremely high.  The shrimp with remoulade was bland.  Something was definitely missing in the ingredients.  My main course of crawfish etoufee was just as disappointing and bland and didn't look good. Sorry but this is another Diners, Drive Ins and Dive disappointment in my opinion. This is a delayed review from April 2014, I've had health issues."}
{"text":"We found this place after Mundo closed down and we event disappointed.  The service is fast and friendly and the food is authentic NOLA. From the gumbo to the char broiled oysters you will not be disappointed.  The only thing they were lacking was a kids menu.  The place is no where near fine dining, so why not offers a kids portion of fried shrimp and fries?"}
{"text":"this place was awesome so much variety in cajun food and the desserts were amazing. simply one of the greatest little restaurants in vegas"}
{"text":"Definitely get the crawfish!! I love how they make it here. Move over boiling crab and hot n juicy! Only thing is, they only serve crawfish on weekends but you can always expect them to be fresh. Shrimp and grits! Doooo it. Ive never had grits before so I didn't know what to expect but it reminded me of polenta so I liked it. And the sauce went with the grilled shrimp. I couldn't choose between their desserts but the chocolate cake and bananas foster bread pudding is delicious!! It's to die for. Get them a la mode! You won't regret it. I couldn't choose so I got both and finished it alllll. Servers are extremely friendly and attentive. They have outdoor and bar seating as well. Casual place to grab dinner and drinks. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves seafood, especially New Orleans style kind of food."}
{"text":"Some of the most authentic creole food I've had since visiting family in Louisiana!  We will be returning often for more of this deliciousness."}
{"text":"A taste of New Orleans indeed... Missing the food on NOLA and went had my chargrilled oysters and catfish and grits,   It's Delish"}
{"text":"The food was great. The only complaint I have is I ordered the Gumbo it wasn't until I got to the last few bites I can taste that it was scorched or the rice was burnt. I went on 7/6/16. I was personally having a bad day and The waitress honestly made my experience worrh it she was attentive other than the bunrt taste at the end everything else we order was great. No I didn't complain about the gumbo I do plan on going back for the desserts. The reviews of the bread pudding alone is worth me going before I leave LV. Hope everyone gives this place a try."}
{"text":"Funniest comment I heard from my coworkers after we ate at Lola \"for the quality of food they served and for the price they charged, they should have thrown in a lap dance for free.\"

The comment above basically summarized our first and last experience at Lola's. We work near downtown and usually venture out to eat for lunch, especially when new place popped up. 

First the service, the waiter was unfriendly and only showed up to take order and bring our food (an hour later). Beside that, he didn't even care to check on us at all. I give service a \"D\"

As many of you have commented on here, make sure you eat before you come to Lola because by the time your food arrives, you would have fainted from hunger already. It shouldn't take like a whole freaking hour just to bring us fried catfish po boy, especially when the food portion is small and has no seasoning at all. I give food quality a \"D\"

This place is pricey but the portion is extremely small. $13 for a small catfish po boy with barely any fish in it. Crawpuppies were extremely tiny and salty. I'm the type of person would pay good money for good food, but I will not pay outraging price for crappy food. I give food value a \"D-\"

Overall, this place failed badly and I'm surprised of the 4 stars review for this place."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Thank you to my friend for telling me to look up Diners, Drive-In's and Dives. I was in the mood for spicy so my family and I made the short drive from our hotel to here. The GPS took me a block or two away to a very ghetto area. Thank god it wasn't there. Lol. We went at 7:45 on a weekday and were out by 8:30. Good service, fairly quick arrival of food.

My son got the chicken strip & fries. He said the chicken didn't have taste but didn't like the ranch sauce. He ended up loving it though, wanting more. It was light and crispy.

I got the hot wings extra spicy and boy they do not mess around!!!! It opened up all my pores on my face and scalp. It was heaven!! The jambalaya with extra sausage was delicious too! My mouth was still on fire so I don't know if it was spicy or not, but it was tasty!

Hubby got the gumbo and that was so good too! I love okra so it was great. I also liked his beer but I forgot what it was. Turbo Dog or something...

I was full but couldn't resist dessert and got the bread pudding. Other than the raisins (I don't like raisins) it was delicious!

I will definitely come back here when I am in Vegas again!!"}
{"text":"Ok...for you true Cajuns this is the only place outside of the south where you will find a REAL shrimp poboy. Fresh shrimp; crunchy on the outside, fresh on the inside. REAL New Orleans French bread; crispy and soft. Party in my mouth!! The waitress even knew what I meant when I ordered it \"sloppy\".  A must for all you southerners who miss the real thing"}
{"text":"Best Cajun food west of Louisiana!!!!!!  And they serve Abita beer.  Portions and service were great.   You definitely have to try the crab and artichoke dip.  Way more crab than I would have ever expected."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed in Lola's. I am so in love with this place :) The Banana's Foster is to die for!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad given the fact my boyfriend was ranting and raving about it.

Though I enjoyed the grilled bread, the po boy and red beans and rice (or maybe because I was extremely hungry) I could not say it was anything remotely close to the authenticity to the great flavors of NOLA food. 

The gumbo was horrid! It was a disgrace to even title it as such! My boyfriend who has been going there for years even said it didn't taste how it use to. The issue began when we told the server that we didn't like the taste and would like it to be sent back and taken off of our tab. They refused and stated it was against policy. Our server sent over a wannabe manager to repeat the same thing. She stated that if I were to say gumbo were too spicy then she would be able to take it off of the bill. I'm thinking to myself \"what difference does that make??!\" After my boyfriend and her went back a forth for awhile, she then admitted that the gumbo had been changed a couple of weeks ago. Which should had been a green light the gumbo to be refunded. Still no budging! So I interjected and suggested that we replace our gumbo for something else. In which they did with no problem. We ate, tipped, and left!

Would I return here again? Nope. I don't see it happening!"}
{"text":"We usually eat here at least 2-3 times each trip, The bronzed shrimp and grits and bronzed catfish and grits are a 10 out of 10. Amazingly good. Tried the charbroiled oysters but they were overcooked and stuck to the shell. the chicken wings were very average. The Bbq shrimp was good, and the sauce they are in is outstanding, Make sure to get extra bread to sop it up with. They also sell t-shirts which are cute."}
{"text":"We went on a quiet weekday for an early dinner. Menu is mostly seafood. We each got a po'boy sandwich. They were okay, but not for the price. The sandwich was heavy on the bread and light on the fillings. Fries and coleslaw were good. 

Our waitress was nice and attentive, but the curtain to the kitchen was open while we dined, and we were treated to competing radios. The dining room had some nice easy-going music that matched the theme, but the young kitchen staff was blasting some heavy metal and goofing around loudly. I wouldn't mind if I paid ten bucks for my meal at a food court, but when you're charged $15 for a small sandwich, you don't want to feel like you're intruding on a staff party. 

I doubt I would return."}
{"text":"We were able to make same day reservations. The food was amazing! I ordered the catfish and grits, the fish was deliciously seasoned and the grits were smooth. My friends and I had a great time with good food. I totally recommend this place and will go back again. :)"}
{"text":"A great authentic American Cuisine.  I have to say , I am not a huge purveyor of Southern cooking, however, after reading yelper Michelle W review of the place, figured we had to give it a shot.  Had clients in town from Italy and France and one of my colleagues wanted to try Rhythm Kitchen and so I suggested Lola's.

1.  Quaint - When you are traipsing around the Charleston area, me thinks the last thing you are going to think about is quaint, cute, cool.  This place is all that and has character. Small, few tables, small bar, and it has just enough of whatever it is to make it just right.

2.  Service - Dominic was there when we entered waiting for our guests. Very nice, knowledgeable, gave us the scoop on the wine he preferred and also on the food.  They set up our table nicely and when we had to add one more, they were very accommodating. We had a party of 9 in here and they took care of us.  I think the place serves 20-25 total?

3.  Food - I was looking to give our out of towners a unique experience to try something uniquely American.  So this is the place we chose.  

Crab Cakes and Craw Puppies - The crab cakes were very substantial, flaky, moist and tender. I enjoyed it.  It was one per order, however, as they are decent size, we asked for each to be cut in two pieces and we ordered enough to share. Ordered craw puppies for the table, never having this before.  Deep fried seafood is the best I can describe this.  Not greasy and bite size tasty bits of seafood. Nice.  Each is the size of a small meatball, 5 per order, so we split two orders.  

Jambalaya - to me, the right blend of spice, rice, seafood. I also ordered the shrimp as an addition and it was just right. Juicy and hits the spot.

Salmon and Sweet potato fries - I think this was the only let down.  The fries had such great flavor yet the salmon was very dry  Dry fish is not too bueno, so this was  of a downer.

Gumbo -Seafood soup like bouillabaisse or cioppino.  I did not have it but one of our friends did. It looked really, really good.

Etoufee - I thought this was something a bald buy wore as he got older?  Perhaps I will need one soon.  Naw, this is a dish similar to the gumbo, just that it is thicker and more like a stew. Whereas the gumbo has seafood, this one here has either shrimp or something else, was the choice, but it was not  mixed like the gumbo.  Now I did not order this, but man did my friend enjoy it. Very nice.

Sweet Potato Pecan Pie a la mode with ice cream - YOu have to come for the desserts.  This is what the wifey and I ordered, and it was really great. I am going to go back for their Banana Foster Bread Pudding.  Don't be shy, order the dessert!!!

GK says, check this place out for sure! I enjoyed it as a unique dining place. Not sure if it is a frequent place for me yet, however, I am going back for other desserts, so I will let you all know."}
{"text":"2 part review as I ate here twice this week.
1st visit: saw it on Triple D w Guy Fieri just before I flew out here so had to give it a try. 
Lunch: gumbo was good, nice flavors but more sausage and less seafood than I would have liked, excellent garlic bread served with it.
Po'Boy, 1/2 fried oysters, 1/2 fried shrimp: nice size, good flavors, good bread. Sweet tea delicious, freshly made, looking forward to next visit - 4 stars.
2nd visit: Disappointing! Ordered the grilled oysters, they were as small as clams, mentioned it to the waitress but no response, no mgr checked on me, think the complaint died w waitress, way overpriced for 1/2 doz grilled oysters that was the equivalent of 2 decent size oysters. 
Ordered the crab cake, picture shows white lump meat but reality was brown crab mush (shredded crab mixed w spices). 1 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Délicieux!

I absolutely enjoyed everything from the seafood platter w/soft shell crab for an additional $3 to the shrimp Po' boy. everything was seasoned to perfection! I have the opportunity to order dessert first and indulged in some yummy Banana Foster!!! 

My mother is born and raised in New Orleans and as a stubborn Cajun woman it's hard to please her but even she gave Lola's two thumbs up! My mothers only grip was the mixed greens and the pungent vinegar taste. We shall return for another traditional dish! 10/2"}
{"text":"I love a good Po Boy.  Especially ones that have southern or Louisiana attached to it. What other kinds are there?  And I had heard that this place had some good ones.  So I ventured here to try me a shrimp BBQ Po Boy.  Place was a little crowded and the tables are literally right next to each other.

Service was very good despite the crowded house.  I also had an unusual side of cole slaw, can't remember what it was called but it was so good.
The sandwich came and I told the waitress that it should be called the \"we don't skimp on the shrimp\" po boy.  The shrimp was falling out of the roll.  It was good, but not great.  I felt it lacked a little seasoning or spicyness.

This place is smothered with all things N.O. Saints, if that works for you. The bar is small, only 6-7 bar stools.  Everyone in here seemed to be a local.

I suppose I need to go in to try other things as I'm sure there are better items.  Maybe"}
{"text":"Finally had the bronzed catfish today with the gouda grits.  As expected, it was New Orleans in a bowl.  Fantastic dish, I liked it better than the shrimp.

Got the crab dip to start.  This is a fine version of a dip, nothing special.  My wife had the crabcakes.  You get 2 large cakes with the meal, but they are on a bed of greens.  This destroys the purpose, in our estimation, of getting that good crispy exterior, because the lettuce makes the bottoms of the cakes soggy.  Good flavor, a bit too citrusy for me in the sauce."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed, we came here because of the feature on Triple D, I was not impressed . I have had the same dish (etoufee) at other restaurants, once in Texas and several times at the oyster bar @sunset station , both were way better than this place .. sorry :/ . I wanted to like it but the food was bland I had to cover it in Tabasco sauce.  My dates shrimp and grits looked better than they tasted. The tables are too close for my comfort , your pretty much dining with strangers so not the best place to have a date since there's not much privacy in terms of personal space."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner. Be warned, if you hate small spaces, this might not be your spot. The restaurant is pretty intimate and by \"intimate\" I mean cramped. Anyway, I ordered the crab cake dinner but as soon as I saw it I was already a little disappointed. Judging by the looks I could tell it was mostly breading. The inside tasted fishy and was not appetizing at all. The order comes with 2 cakes but one was burnt on one side, leaving a very bitter taste. Of course they served it with the burnt side down thinking I wouldn't notice. It was inedible to me. In fact, most of the plates came out over cooked and over fried (not just blackened or charred). Service was a little on the slow side and they even moved us to another table when a large group came in. I wasn't impressed at all."}
{"text":"My first time here. Came with a group of 10 people for my friend's birthday. Almost passed it driving by when I got off of the freeway! 

The décor is cute. This is a really tiny hole in the wall, Louisiana themed. I was told by a friend their other location is noticeably bigger. 

My friend ordered the garlic bread and crab & artichoke dip for an appetizer. The bread was really tasty, and I only had one bite of the crab dip, but I would definitely order some for myself next time. I had been eyeing the crawpuppies on the menu, but didn't order them right away. I saw someone else at the table had, so I did eventually order them. They were really good! There is a tiny hint of spice, and they were soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside. Yum. 

I ordered the crab cake dinner for my meal. It's two crab cakes on top of lettuce with some sort of dressing. It was in the shape of two \"Ls\". Pretty basic. They were tasty, but could have used something else. Not sure what. It didn't come with anything, so I ordered a side of coleslaw, since I love coleslaw. The coleslaw was pretty good. 

My friend ordered the crawfish. He is from Louisiana, and he said it reminded him of home. He ate the whole 2 pounds! It came with 2 potatoes and 2 pieces of corn. It smelled really flavorful. 

I'm not sure why other reviews say the servers are creepy. We had a really nice lady with a broken foot, and she still kicked ass. I liked this place!"}
{"text":"Preface:  My wife is originally from LA. So when we travel and I come across a Cajun or Creole restaurant on Yelp, regardless of the ratings she always says \"look for someone who is from the south and read their review.\"  

We got lost finding the place, even with GPS.  Coming south on Charleston be ready to turn right as soon as you cross the freeway.  We missed it and because of construction ended up running around for fifteen minutes trying to get back to the restaurant.  I'm glad we did.

The atmosphere is amazing.  My wife said, \"Now this is a New Orleans style kitchen\" as soon as she walked in the door and smelled the food and saw the New Orlean Saints Super Bowl banner plastered on the wall.

We had made a reservation through Yelp, we were very quickly seated even though we were early.  The service the whole visit was exceptional.  Our cups never ran dry and our server was great at helping us decide on appetizers and my wife's dessert.

We both ended up getting the D'Brees sandwhich we both had ours dressed a little different but from the first bite to the last it was good food.  My wife made many comments about how it reminded her of home in Louisiana.  I should mention my wife's pregnant and when she finished her sandwhich and saw the dessert menu the first thing out of her mouth was and I seriously quote, \"It's a good thing I wore my Maternity Pants.\"

She ordered a Banana Pudding which came out in a large bowl with a broule'd marshmellow topping.  She pouted when she finished it.

We plan to return again probably during this same trip here in Vegas.  If your looking for great food, amazing service, and a reasonable price this is the place to stop.  It's a very close quick drive from downtown Vegas."}
{"text":"Just like other reviews I saw Lola's on the food network show Diners, drive-in's, and dives and just had to check it out. I went to the Charleston location. The decor was cute and reminded me of New Orleans . Having been to that city several times, I ordered a cup of gumbo with the hushpuppies. The gumbo was decent. In my opinion, I thought it needed to be seasoned just a little bit more but it was edible. The hushpuppies were tasty if you like them fishy. Despite that, the service was good and the food came out quick. I will go back another time, maybe try the Summerlin location to see if my rating changes."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. The food is fantastic and flavorful, and the atmosphere is festive. Just make sure to make a reservation because its popular and small."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, close to my work so a great place to go for a tasty lunch! I've gone several times, and each time the food was excellent! Ive  had the Étouffée, the jambalaya, red beans and rice, the bronzed shrimp with grits, the crab cake appetizer and all were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with a bunch of friends. Thank goodness we made reservations cause the place got packed quick and we got the biggest table there.  For starters we all got the craw puppies to share. It was small morsels of tasty crawfish. Crawfish flavor wasn't powerful but you can taste a hint of it. Don't smother it with too much sauce or else that's all you'll taste. Our table got an assortment of things, but I ended up getting the catfish with Gouda grits. I was debating between that and the Shrimp creole. Upon the waitress's recommendation, I went with the catfish. The food came at a relatively slow place. But the kitchen was small and we were the biggest party in the restaurant. My dish was good... The grits are not overwhelming cheesy and the catfish was nice and tender. The dish lacked some texture though. Everything was mushy. Also it lacked some herby freshness... You know when the dish is getting kind of salty and you want something vegetably or herby to cleanse the palate?  It was good but I should have known that this would be a heavy dish. It came with the best toasted bread though. I love the toasted bread with olive oil. My friend got the jumbalaya with shrimp and I really liked his dish. It was spicy and sweet. However I didn't think the shrimp upgrade was worth it. They charge you 4 bucks more for 3 shrimp on top. I also got to try the smoked chicken. It was very moist but I wouldn't order that at a Cajun restaurant. We also shared the sweet potato pecan pie and bananas fosters. Was a little disappointed they don't have beignets. The sweet potato pecan pie was not that amazing. It's like regular pecan pie with a layer of sweet potato. I think you can imagine the flavor. The banana fosters bread pudding was like pure Carmel and brown sugar. I can feel the grittiness of the clumps of sugar in my mouth. Thank god we shared and everyone only had to eat a bite. All in all I like this place but I think some dishes are better than others."}
{"text":"Although it was a small space, the food was amazing. Shrimp and grits seemed to be the most popular. I had the jambalaya and it had a kick to it! So good"}
{"text":"Good little find! Felt like I was in NOLA! Food is yummy! We had the Hoppin' John, Crawpuppies, bronzed shrimp, fried catfish, green beans, mustard & turnip greens, potato salad, sweet potato fries and banana pudding!!! A lil bit of errrrthing! We nibbled on it all and left some on the plate...tummy is satisfied!! Cute spot and the service was friendly and quick!!"}
{"text":"Gotta get their signature dish, catfish and grits. The fish was a little too spicy for my liking but hey it's Cajun food, so can't complain. The grits were soooo good with Gouda cheese in them. Service was very friendly and quick. One downside is that the actual restaurant is a little small for how popular this place is. But in the end it kinda adds to the atmosphere, especially on a weekend evening. You gotta go!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I heard many wonderful things about this place and a friend's birthday was coming up, so we thought it would be a great idea to visit this restaurant on Saturday, March 3rd.  

Let me start by saying that the location could be better.  It's on a very weird intersection on Charleston and in the middle of an awkward strip mall-ish building.  I didn't really get it.  Also, thank goodness we made reservations...there were two tables in the entire restaurant (I'm being fecitious).  All in all, the place offers a very cozy, intimate and homely setting.  We were even greeted by Lola Beth herself.  What a treat!  I must add though that it was hard to say that she was completely welcoming.  Our first impression was that she was a nice lady, however, when talking with her at our table later in the evening, her facial expressions really wasn't as welcoming as we thought.

We decided to order a bunch of items on the menu so that we could put the accolades to the test.  Here's what I tasted:

Crab Cakes- Loved these cakes.  A lot of lump crab meat and not a lot of filler.  The way a crab cake should be.  I loved fact that it sat on a bed of greens and was accompanied with a lemon aioli.  Fantastic combination.  My only criticism is that it was about 6 dollars and included only one cake.  For four people, we ended up getting two orders.  I little pricy in my opinion, but I would pay for that again.

Craw Puppies- To me, I didn't think this appetizer was memorable.  Not something I would choose to order again.  I'm a huge fan of crawfish, but not a fan of hush puppies, so the combination of the two did work for me.  The remoulade did help bring the dish together in the end.

Catfish Po Boy-  I thought this was an excellent choice.  For dinner, I wasn't looking to eat or spend a lot.  Great choice.  For about 11 dollars, I enjoyed a great sandwich.  The bread was grilled nicely.  It wasn't hard or soft where it would become soggy with the lettuce, tomatoes and mayo.  It was perfect.  What sealed the dish for me was the side of fries I had.  Super crispy and super homeade, which made it that much more better.

Sweet Potato Pecan Pie- We did decide to add chantilly cream and that was what made this dessert good. I'm not a fan of pecans. Because of that, I didn't really find myself going back for more.  My hope was that the chantilly cream would help mask the taste of the pecans, but unfortunately, it did not.

Lola's Famous Bread Pudding- Now with bread pudding, I am a HUGE fan. This dessert did NOT disappoint.  SOOOO delicious.  I found myself fighting for the last bit of bread pudding with my friends.  The run praline sauce was superb and although it wasn't offered on the menu, our server was nice enough to suggest also adding the chantilly cream on this dessert.  Such a fantastic combination!

Bananas Foster- Although I didn't admit this to my friends at the time, I had never tried bananas foster before.  This was an \"AH-MAZE-ING\" first experience.  C'mon!  Brown sugar coated bananas with vanilla bean ice cream.  How could you go wrong!  Each spoonful presented a new pleasant feeling that just ended the evening with a positive experience.  What a great dessert!

All in all, I'd say I had a great time.  I was accompanied with three wonderful friends and discovered a \"dive-type\" restaurant that offered, for the most part, wonderful Cajun Connections, as their website states.  Being a fan of southern cooking, I will not be opposed returning to try other menu items and of course, Lola's famous bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Time to get off the strip and go to a normal restaurant and what a restaurant! I had the Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya  and it was AWESOME!! My girlfriend had the New Orleans Style BBQ Shrimp and they were incredible too!! Overall a REALLY good, off the strip, real world dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Awsommmmm poboy beef and black shrimp with grits wow flavorfull must try when you in vegas"}
{"text":"Lola's had always come highly recommended by my co-workers from the New Orleans/Laffeyette area so I was eager to try it. I went there with a big group of friends and found it to be as good as I had heard. 

I have a hard time passing up gumbo if it's on the menu, so that is what I ordered here. Although it was made from a darker roux than I have previously had, it was still delicious with a lot of andouille in the mix. I also got a taste of the grilled salmon and fried catfish and found them to be very good. 

Dessert-wise, I can say with all honesty that the Jack Daniels praline sauce that comes with the bread pudding is one of the tastiest confections I have ever had and if I had not been in public and surrounded by 7 of my closest friends and 30 strangers, I would have probably drank the rest of it and licked the plate clean. 

The jambalaya also looked very appetizing and the po' boys menu has piqued my curiosity. I will be returning in the future that's for sure.

Just a word of warning though, Lola's has a higher-end/gourmet style of presentation so if the only experience you have with Cajun/Creole is the pan roasts at Big Al's, you may find the portions to be a bit lighter than what you're used to. However, you will be more than compensated by the quality of the food, ambiance of the restaurant, and the friendliness of the staff."}
{"text":"We had a big group and love the service here. I had the charbroiled oysters which was amazing.  Then I had the shrimp pasta dish that was full of flavor and spicy.  There is nothing I can complain about.  I love it!"}
{"text":"Although we were staying at the Vegas strip, I opt for meals outside of the normal franchised big wigs. Now, there is nothing wrong with the franchised restaurants.  I frequent them enough but we like to support mom&pop shops, and local eateries.  Besides, we didn't drive all the way up here to eat at Cheesecake Factory or Buffalo Wild Wings.. come on people!! They're so much out there!!! get out of the strip and venture out.

This find was an absolute bomb idea, and I have to thank my yelppies for directing me to it.  This place is in the outskirts of Downtown Vegas, I would like to say a corner of the industrial district but I don't know the location to well.  It only took us 13 minutes to get there.  Very easy to find and off the freeway.  Plenty of parking and its free!

They open at 11 and already several people were waiting. That's a good sign!  The closed signed turned to open and everyone stood up.  I almost felt the need to rush in and say, hey we got here first.  If you didnt read the sign that says Saints Nation then you wont be surprised. Inside filled of every thing NOLA is about, colors of black, purple, green, yellow, gold, Saints banners, feathers, beads. So if you are really against the NOLA Saints, then go elsewhere but you'll be seriously missing out. The menu has a decent amount of selections.  I was at NOLA this past April and sort of knew what I wanted to try. Pitting NOLA food to Vegas.   I ordered the blackened catfish and grits, my husband ordered the Roast Beef Da Breeze (in the PoBoy section). I also ordered a side of red beans and rice, and 1-crab cake patty.

The food came out fairly quickly, they put my meal in front of me and I was already salivating. I couldn't wait and had a spoon full of the sauce. At first I thought it was rather salty and it took down my excitement down a notch. But as I mixed the sauce with the grits it was perfect! The grits were cheesy but without the sauce, it was missing its seasoning. Combine the two it sings in perfect harmony. Seriously, I enjoyed every bite. I thought, DAM just like NOLAs.  It was so good. I took the rest back to the hotel to eat (even though they didn't have a microwave, I was willing to eat it cold). My husband's PoBoy looked appetizing, and he said it was good. It was slathered with gravy on top. He did say he would prefer the gravy on the side. I didn't taste the poboy since I was really attempting to eat my meal. The red beans and rice, was just okay. The crab cake was very moist, and real crab!!! Would love this in a sandwich. 

The waitress and employees were all very nice, attentive and available for any questions. People from the back that occasional came out for something always came out with a smile. GO GO GO.. well worth it!!"}
{"text":"We were brought here by friends from California who frequent Vegas a lot. The New Orleans Style BBQ Shrimp was perfect. The waitress was a sweety and on top of anything we needed. Have been back since and just as good! Look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We loved Lola's - and often joke that the food is good enough to merit the cost of the flight. (Probably not, but definitely one of the only places that we'll keep on our 'every time we're in Vegas' list.)

His plate: Roast Beef Debris
Her plate: Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya

One of the better Jambalayas I've had, made even better by the house-made jalapeno hot sauce. Not too hot, TONS of flavor. Perfectly cooked rice, excellent sausage, just plain great overall.

D loved his sandwich - chosen because it's what Yelp suggested, and Guy had when he visited. Great flavor, excellent sauces.

We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday at Lola's and our party was a group of 5. The food was delicious and the service was great. The waiting time between apertizer and main course was perfect. The price of food and drinks was just right. The only suggestion for improvement is that the restaurant needs to replace the chairs. Main chairs had rips in them."}
{"text":"Lola's - best Louisiana style food I've had. Even when I've been to Louisiana. 

I love to get crab cakes anywhere I go, and this place has some of the best I've ever had. They were large, crispy and cooked just perfect in the inside. I can't even begin to tell you enough of how much I adore crab cakes. I just can't. My head might explode. 
I also had the Shrimp Caesar salad and had the shrimp blackened. Amazing. The Caesar dressing was so thick and creamy, but not too rich. 
Shrimp and Grits. Let me tell you, I have never been a fan of grits, but I made an exception, and I was patting myself on the back for doing so. Very creamy, nice and garlicky and the shrimp were huge! ( Had them blackened as well. ) 

Also, they have Abita beers. Purple Haze is a great one that's light and tasty.

The service was very quick and friendly and I will go there as much as humanly possible for my splurging days."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch. Etoufee was well done, good consistency and flavor. Jambalaya was also the right amount of everything. Finished it off with Bananas Foster bread pudding. Our taste journey down creole lane was awesome!!!! Try this quaint place you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had the red beans & rice and jambalaya! Gotta try it! Cajun at its finest! Couldn't find the new Summerlin location on Yelp but u gotta check it out! We sat on the outside patio In the afternoon and it was perfect! It's a great restaurant with really amazing staff! I don't normally post reviews but occasionally u meet the nicest people and get the best service so it deserves a good mention! Make sure u ask for \"FARAH\" when u you there. She's possibly the nicest server we've ever met! She's sharp, professional, and great with the guests! Because of her and the food, we will definitely be back and we will refer Lola's to all our friends! Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"If you can't visit New Orleans, let New Orleans come to you! Everything from the interior to the menu made me miss the Big Easy. And boy, do I love NOLA. Lola's is pretty unique when it comes to dining near DTLV. Nothing about it reminds you of The Strip. It's understated, casual, and fairly easy to score a reservation. 

I took my parents here for a belated b-day dinner in January. It was a weeknight and I wasn't looking to spend big bucks on a meal. Lola's takes reservations on Yelp and, as I said before, kind of a unique gem near downtown. Not your typical strip mall or casino eatery.

We started with oysters and crawpuppies. And for an entree we tried etoufeee as well as gumbo. All of the food was cooked well and came out quickly. All of this paired well with an Abita beer or glass of chilled white wine. 

As it got later into the evening, the restaurant started filling up quickly and was getting loud. Being that I was with my parents who are older and hardly \"party people\", we ordered dessert to-go and made it an early night.

Overall, I'd recommend Lola's to anyone looking for a relatively authentic NOLA meal way outside the south. Also, for folks looking to have a \"normal\" dining experience in Las Vegas, this is a solid spot to pick."}
{"text":"Closest you can get to Louisiana cooking in Vegas, just as good as I've had in Louisiana. If you are in Vegas Lola's is a place to check out."}
{"text":"I've spent lots of time in New Orleans and this place certainly has brought the southern spiced food flare to Vegas.  We started with the Craw Puppies appetizer and gumbo...perfect combo to get the cajun spices flowing in our mouths.  The gumbo lacked a little flavor but it was still good.  I had the grits and shrimp dish for an entre...absolutely perfect.  The grits were done just right surrounded with andoulle sausage in a mushroom sauce topped with 8 thick shrimp...deeelicious!  Lastly, the pumpkin bread pudding for dessert was cat's meow!  The small atmosphere, service,  and food are wonderful assets to Vegas.  It's close to downtown and only a 10 minute cab ride from the strip.  If you're in town,  put it on your list."}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful. I love southern/cajun food. I've been here twice and every time I leave I can't wait to come back and try something new. Crawpuppies are divine and I am not a fan of hush puppies at all. The crawfish really adds another dimension of flavor to the traditional dish. Had a cup of gumbo and the only bad part about it was that I didn't order a bowl. Just a hint of spice so you know it's there, but not overwhelming. Perfect on a cold day. My boyfriend has tried their chili dog po' boy. I'd say skip it. The bread is the best part, but a chili dog is a chili dog. I had a platter with a little bit of their seafood choices. It did not disappoint. Catfish is cooked to perfection; it is some flaky moist goodness. The mussels we heavenly. Easily the best thing on my plate. Crab cakes were good, but nothing to write home about. My friend ordered the shrimp & grits and it was creamy goodness. If you've ever wanted to try it or you're already a fan order it. Now on to dessert. I saw bananas foster on the menu and that is what made me drag everyone here with me. (and reasons I have gone back since) Who doesn't love bananas, with buttery, sweet, sugary sauce and vanilla bean ice cream? Probably the same people that enjoy clubbing baby seals. If I was on death row and had to place my order for my last meal bananas foster from Lola's would be part of that order. Only bad thing about this place is the size of the dining area. I imagine it gets packed at peak times, but trust me it's worth it."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try here for a while. The location is fairly small. The food was great, My boyfriend had the gumbo and I had the fettuccine alfredo with blackened shrimp. Very yummy. We, also, split a crab cake which was delicious and one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Actually came here yesterday with my boyfriend. It was his first time! We ordered crawpuppies for an appetizer and he got a fried catfish po boy and I got the shrimp n grits. Everything was delicious and my boyfriend was so excited that they had Abita beer."}
{"text":"What a gem! This places respects those who make reservations so make sure to get one as they are quite busy. The restaurant is small but has some personality. The Fleur de Lys and mardi gra beads make an appearance. They have an open grill in the front of the restaurant which was pretty cool since the servers grill up oysters and garlic bread for guests. I want you to know that it has been a very long time since I have enjoyed a restaurant from start to finish. I enjoyed everything at this place. This place serves Louisiana brews. I ordered a strawberry lager which was AMAZING! If you like the Sam Adams Cherry wheat you are bound to be impressed. For starters we had the Crawpuppies, mmm these things are a must try! Entrees, I had the signature shrimp and grits and my husband had the DDD featured roast beef sandwich, both were delicious. With the appetizer and entrees being so good my husband and I could not think of skipping dessert even though we were stuffed. We ordered the banana's foster bread pudding, oh my! This was other worldly. It just sealed the deal, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Lola's is a must for us every time we are in LV. We didn't have reservations but we're able to sit at the bar. I had the catfish and grits with Gouda cheese yum yum. My husband had red beans and rice with sausage. It's a little too spicy for me but he loved it. The garlic bread OMG. Can't say enough about this place. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.
Food was great , good service at the worst table in the house at 5pm. Hostess essentially told me that was the table near the back door in the corner.  Every employee arriving at work went through a lengthy check in directly behind/next to us. The employees put their purses etc in the cabinet behind one changed shoes at the check in station.  The hostess told me half the room was closed an the corner was the only option."}
{"text":"Finally made it down to Lola's!

We went with the Charbroiled Oysters to start :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#2KX0qqRWWzza4lvTzNQ1cw

They are dressed with Garlic, Lemon, and a blend of cheeses! These were pretty good!  Not mind blowing but good at around $12-13 if I remember correctly.

I went with the Blackened Shrimp Poboy on New Orleans French Bread! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?select=-rgLE3shfCXIeA1fprAIGg#09IBYP8kA8h-iBcCyldMuA

Great sandwich...just wish the shrimp were a little larger taking into consideration the price, but they were cooked well and had tons of flavor!  For some odd reason, I was served my sandwich without my fries though...they came later, after I took my time taking pics of both entrees, eating bites of both entrees, and starting on my second half of the sandwich, the fries finally came.  I did like the seasoning on them though...slight cajun salt style on some \"well done\" cooked fries.

The Bronzed Catfish and Grits : 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#26bezKK4tDMzoxIcy2zvdA

Fresh Catfish, Bronzed, over Smoked Gouda Grits with Andouille Sausage and Mushroom Ragout. Cooked well and very yummy! Would recommend it!  Portions were a bit small in comparison to other cajun/southern style places we have been to in town though, and the prices were not cheap (not expensive either) in that reflection, but still good.

For dessert, there was a miscommunication...we wanted the Banana Foster Bread Pudding but got the regular banana fosters instead :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#2nBYfnTojNkJf_zpe0iAoQ

It was good, but not nearly as good as the bread pudding! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#6VaYCDgiODV53TnSZylS_A

It is made of Banana Bread / Bread Pudding, fresh Bananas, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Fosters Sauce! Very very good!! This was the highlight of the night for me!  The top of the ice cream had a slight creme brulee like crisp on it too!

Small complaint.  When we saw that we received the wrong intended dessert, we told the server and she ordered us the right one.  We had a bite or two of the wrong dessert thinking there might be some bread pudding hiding in there, but we quickly realized it was the wrong order.  They never took the wrong dessert off the table, so we ended up picking at it a bit, but still left at least 70% of the dessert on the table.  When the tab came through, we got charged for both.  I didn't complain or say anything, but the server asked us if we ate any of the wrong item, and I said we picked at it, but left most of it on the table.  She then offered to pay half of the plate costs $4 of the $8...

If this was almost at any other restaurant in town, the wrong order would have been comped.  If I would have raised a fuss, it would have been comped.  But because I didn't do that, Lola's paid for half..take it for what you will.

Overall, I can recommend this place, but the price/portion ratio isn't as solid as some of the other Cajun/Southern style spots in town, and the food was good, but not mind blowing good like Cajun spiced food should be!  A very solid 3 star spot in my book.

90/100 challenge"}
{"text":"Service was super slow. We were waiting for at least a good hour for our food and there were no updates or apologies for the slow service. We were also probably the last people to leave for the night. I think we got in around 8pm, we didn't leave til about 10pm. It's a good thing the food made up for the service. I ordered the jumbalaya and my boyfriend ordered the gumbo. His friend ordered the chicken strips with fries. Overall, we really enjoyed our food. The jumbalaya had quite a kick to it. It was really spicy. I tasted some of the gumbo and it was also quite tasty. Prices were reasonable considering it is Vegas and off the strip.

A few things to note. My boyfriend and his friend are both blind. He doesn't need you to help him put a straw in his cup, especially when he says that he is fine. Please don't assume someone needs or wants your help just because they have a disability. Ask before doing. I know you just want to help but trust me the person will appreciate it more if you ask before helping them.

If the service was faster, I'd probably give this place a higher rating. It was also a little bit tucked away. Our Uber driver had to make a Uturn."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The charleston location is a small quaint place. Been there several times for lunch and that stays packed! Not even exaggerating. The service is eh. Honestly took them a while to fill my water cup several times, but when you are packed like they are, I can see the reason for iffy service.
I definitely love the food. I am from Louisiana and I can vouch for the flavor in their food. Definitely from back home. Go and get some shrimp and grits! That ragout sauce will make you wish there was more. And their poboys are worth a second or third try. 

I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. jambalaya, gumbo, chicken strips and sweet tea! Wow so good grate fun place with good clean environment. Staff more then friendly... I really enjoyed my food and my experience. I felt like I was in a really neat and fun secret place that maybe only the locals know about and it was fantastic."}

{"text":"This place is always jam-packed and for a damn good reason. The food is always great and the atmosphere is fun. I've had the jambalaya, étouffée, crab cakes, oysters, shrimp po boys, roast beef debris, and of course the banana foster bread pudding which reigns supreme. If you are a beer lover they also have many versions of New Orleans own beer, Abita. The only downside is the parking which can be a pain. Everyone should definitely try this place out, Lola is also opening a new place in Summerlin soon and I can't wait to get there."}
{"text":"Came to have dinner by myself...... Been wanting gumbo for years. The place is in an area that seems sketchy but once i got into the parking lot it wasn't so bad.
Tried a cup of their gumbo which was good and it hit the spot, proceeded to order the shrimp and grits which was amazing. I'm glad I made a stop here and waiting on my dessert!!! 
The staff was really nice and even though the place was busy they were attentive."}
{"text":"I've been to Lola's at least twice now and I really enjoy the catfish po' boy! The atmosphere is nice with a bit of hussle and bussle. The second time I was there I sat in the outdoor seating area and they were doing a photo shoot for some of the food they have. Ended up getting some free oysters for appetizer before the meal. They were great and probably tasted even better because they were free :-). I definitely look forward to coming here again."}

{"text":"I'm so excited there's some authentic New Orleans cooking now in Las Vegas! The place is cute and family owned-operated. My extended family all lives in New Orleans so I'm quite familiar with the cuisine. I'm also a very harsh critic! 

*$4.25 - cup of gumbo. She puts sausage, chicken AND seafood in her gumbo. I found it heavy on the chicken and light on the seafood. The flavor was great. Really took me back to NOLA! Basically was a chicken/sausage flavored gumbo with a couple shrimp thrown in.
*$11.99 - 1/2 dozen charbroiled oysters. *sigh* I'm pretty spoiled here. I didn't find these nearly as good as real new orleans charbroiled oysters, but they were still enjoyable
*$9.99 - Shrimp poboy with fries. The poboy was a little small compared to what I'm used to , but otherwise it was perfect. They fly their bread in from new orleans and the shrimp were so delish! The best poboy I've ever had outside of nola!

Overall I'll be back. Their dessert menu looked incredible (bananas foster, bread pudding!). Prices weren't bad ($7.99-$12.99 per entree). Service was polite and speedy. Give them a try Yelp!"}
{"text":"In Vegas there's so many restaurants to choose from. But because of my fellow Yelpers we gave this highly rated spot a try. We were blown away that the food was so good and the spices was so close to New Orleans Style. For starters, we had the crab cake and the craw puppies. Unfortunately, you only get one crab cake. Then ordered the BBQ shrimp and the shrimp creole which had just the right seasoning. Food was delicious but could increase the portions. The atmosphere is nice and waitress was nice. I recommend getting there when they're opening. It gets crowded fast with the people who work in the area."}
{"text":"My first and last experience at Lola's had problems different than I have read others post before dining here.

We went at an off-peak time of the afternoon so there was no wait and the attending server seemed nice enough, nothing more.

However, when the po'boy came I asked \"where the seafood was\" ????
The server replied with some sort of typical number of ounces that are placed on each sandwich. As if there was a government agency in their kitchen certifying each and every sandwich leaves with precisely the correct and accurate amount....hmmmm.

As some previous reviewers said, plan to eat before you go here whether it be the wait or the tiny amount of food. 

No, we were hoping to find a great place for Cajun but........ \"THIS AIN'T IT\"!"}
{"text":"Okay . . . I'll be honest . . . almost missed this place . . . it is tucked in between businesses that had I not looked at the right time I would have missed it.  Upon entering . . . I was greeted promptly . . . and chose to seat at the small bar as to not take up a whole table for my party of one.

I asked the waitress what she would recommend . . . and she point out a few choices that were diners favorites . . . and I forgot to mention were featured on Triple D.  And sure enough after she told me that . . . I noticed the picture of Guy on the wall.

Anyways . . . I ordered the crab cake and a fried oyster po-boy . . . the crab cake was full of crab and had this great sauce the was so tasty that I finished the bed of green the cake was sitting on since it was covered with this delightful sauce . . . the po-boy was also very good, crispy oysters a nice roll and again a wonderful sauce.

To say 
I am now a fan would be an understatement . . . I made reservations for tomorrow . . . this place could not wait for a return trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Make reservations so you don't wait awhile."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  I fell in love with the New Orleans Style BBQ Shrimp.  My group and I had the Crab Cake, Crab and Artichoke Dip, Crawpuppies, Sweet Potato Fries and Bread Pudding.  All were excellent.  If you love Cajun food go here."}
{"text":"I loveeeeeee NOLA. This place reminds me so much of the food back in the french quarter. You must have the charbroiled oysters. They are buttery and a good amount of garlic. The best part you dip their grilled french bread in the oyster juice and WOW I'm already craving it now haha. The blackened catfish and grits are so good and the fish is flaky and the best part is the grits arn't bland. You also gotta have abita beer which is from nola with your meal. The owner Lola is always there with her husband cooking and entertaining guests. This place is super small and it's off of the 15 on charleston. It is right by the premium outlet malls. It gets pretty busy at night so it's good to make a reso."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with some Canadian friends visiting from Toronto.  Turned out the place was packed!!  Food was delicious - ordered shrimp and grits, gumbo, jambalaya, and a creole dish.   The CrawFish were the last day in season and were awesome.  Hard to believe I used to catch and use those critters as fish bait for large mouth bass.    Overall delicious!!   Would recommend and return for sure."}
{"text":"Ate here last night.  Busy, great service, wonderful Louisiana fare.  Bread pudding is the best!"}
{"text":"Dinner out with my two favorite men. Food was good as usual however young hostess wouldn't stop arranging her tits.REALLY!  I was really annoyed that my husband was subjected to the view. Another thing she shouldn't chew gum(gives her a dumb look) . On the good side our waitress was fabulous. Don't know her name."}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, the best Cajun food I have had outside of south Louisiana.  It felt like home walking into the restaurant, small hole in the wall, nothing fancy.  The food was great, served hot and reasonable time.  The Shrimp & Gouda Grits were amazing.  It was amazing to find real Leidenheimer french bread outside of southern La.  Tried three desserts, all were great:  Bread pudding, Choclate Cake & the Fig Cake.  Will try the Banna's Foster Bread Pudding next time.  This place is on my 5 Star list and I'm a Foodie."}
{"text":"It has been one of those nights when I was hungry but couldn't figure out what I was hungry for.  Looking back on recent trips, I decided I want some New Orleanian food.  So, off to Lola's I went.  The place was busy (always a good sign) and I was greeted by a friendly server.  With all the fleur de lis, Abita logo, paintings of antebellums...I was in Saints country without a doubt.  I sat under Guy Fieri's signed picture.

I got a sweet tea (as I should) and my sister ordered some char-grilled oysters.  According to her, they were good but not similar to Acme Oyster House's grilled oysters.  Since I'm allergic to shellfish, I have to believe it.  She had the shrimp and grits and she loved it.  I like their grits too...really cheesy!  I got the roast beef debris po' boy with fries (featured on Guy Fieri's show on the Food Network: Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives).  My fries were salty so I had to dust off the salt and dip them in lots of ketchup.  They're like the fries from Five Guys but 3 times the salt.

For dessert, we had the sweet potato pecan pie and the BANANAS FOSTER BREAD PUDDING.  The pie was quite good.  The bread pudding with the homemade caramel sauce was out of this world - I don't recommend sharing it.

They have oysters, po' boys, sweet potato, bananas foster, sweet tea, gumbo, étouffée, gumbo...all they need are beignets and alligator."}
{"text":"When my father was in town we decided to pay homage to my hometown state of Louisiana and with the crisp, chilly weather ghosts of Gumbo past had me cravin' cajun. I've had Lola's bookmarked for a long time and based on Yelp reviews, it seemed legit. 

Walking in, I noticed a stack of King Cakes and Louisiana paraphernalia decorated the walls (beads, fleur de lys, Bourbon Street signs, and Saints flags). I felt like I had stepped into a restaurant in the French Quarter, it was small and quaint. Recommendations are strongly recommend. My father and I lucked out and were seated at a hi-top table near the bar. 

Our server came over and greeted us with a smile and warm, \"Hey y'all! What can I get you to drink while y'all are lookin' over the menu?\" authentic accent and all. (Seriously, it's a portal to Louisiana and Southern hospitality.) I ordered a sweet tea (which is SO hard to find West of the Mississippi - besides Texas) and our drinks were ordered promptly arrived with warm, freshly buttered and flashed grilled bread. We both ordered a cup of Gumbo and we're still narrowing down our choices.

The Gumbo arrived with lightning speed & was on point. It was thick (a lot of people think it's a soup, but it's very much like a stew) and filled with chunks (not bits) of Andouille sausage, shrimp, chicken, and okra. Tasted like home; it was excellent.

For entrees we ordered Crawfish Etouffee (my FAVORITE Cajun dish of all-time) and Shrimp Creole. The etouffee was amazing, the butter, garlic, and green pepper flavors well balanced and there was just the right amount of heat. The good times we're definitely being had by my mouth. Shrimp Creole was also amazing, tomato-y, peppery, garlicky, onion-y paradise. The shrimp were also huge (love me some oximorons). I found out that their shrimp, crawfish, and catfish were flown in from Louisiana. At this point we were way too full to try dessert. I am planning a second trip back to explore more of menu and to give that Banana's Foster Bread Pudding. 

I got to live the Louisiana state motto: \"Come fall in Love with Louisiana all over again\" on my trip to Lola's. It's great to know that there is great Creole & Cajun cuisine just around the corner. Excellent service. Standout, authentic food! A warm, friendly atmosphere. Laissez les bon temps roulezer in your mouth at Lola's!"}
{"text":"weird location... small and quaint.  heard great things so we decided to go...

we sat inside, the outside seating has too much traffic noise. when we sat down the service was fast and friendly.  

they gave us complimentary bread which was garlicky and crisp and good.
we ordered the crawfish hushpuppies...to die for!!! served with a yummy creamy sauce...i could have just ate these all day!!! best thing i ate there.

i ordered the chicken and sausage jambalaya with cajun shrimp added.  the shrimp were spicy delicious and so dang good!  i should have just ordered that with rice.  the jambalaya was filled with lots of andouille sausage and chicken, it was spicy and good.. .but very heavy and filling.  i had a lot left.

we also ordered the red beans and rice... it was creamy and delicious. 

i will definitely go again, next time i'll get 2 orders of the hushpuppies and just the cajun shrimp... mmmmm."}
{"text":"The place is SMALL, I definitely reccomend calling ahead for a reservation.  We ordered the dressed poor boy, it just fell flat, didn't really have too much flavor and I did not enjoy the mustard dressing at all.   Some other folks in my party ordered other items from the menu and I didn't see anything I would come back to try.  

We had the banana foster bread pudding, we really enjoyed it.  

The crab artichoke dip with the toasted bread was tasty unfortunately I wouldn't come back just for dessert or appetizer."}
{"text":"I wish I had taken photos of my meal.. But the dishes never lasted long enough to snap! What an amazing find! The oysters were the best I ever had.. \"Charbroiled\". The crawfish my boyfriend are was authentic and spicy. My grilled mandarin chicken bowl... Had a nice presentation .. Real grilled chicken and a little spicy which was nice. So good!! Thanks Heather for the excellent service!"}
{"text":"I'd give them a 3.5 if I was able to. It's an easy place to miss but it's worth the stop for a bite of decent food. We are in Vegas for another weekend and as I almost always do, I Yelp every business I think of trying to see what my fellow Yelper's have experienced. In this case, I couldn't help but see (or taste) for myself to find out which reviews I could identify with. Bottom line, as it has been stated \"The food is GOOD, but not GREAT\". I 100% agree with this statement.

I took photos of the food we had except for the wings and Red Beans & Rice I missed those. We had a sampler of items; Gumbo, Red Beans & Rice, Jambalaya, Chargrilled Oysters, Craw-puppies, Cajun Hot Wings & Bread Pudding. How was it? The Red Beans & Rice was good and so was the Bread Pudding. The wings at a #8 level of spiciness was indeed spicy but flavorful. As far as the other items...well, I wouldn't order the Gumbo again, not that it wasn't good, the taste was just off for me and I also thought it lacked seafood; mine had half of a shrimp tail as I recall. The overall taste was ok but having had gumbo in so many places including New Orleans , I'd have to say, in comparison, the gumbo at Lucille's has better taste than Lola's. The  Craw-puppies; two (2) issues -cost to food ratio and taste; you get four (4) bite size (literal bite size) pieces for $5.29, I wouldn't order it again, the crawfish wasn't the main ingredient, it was moist breading with a strong mayo/mustard combo taste. For the very small size and qty, I thought it would be packed with crawfish and be bursting with flavor but it was not and did not. The Jambalaya was ok, my husband liked it enough -for me, it didn't have the tomato and seasonings infused to the rice taste but more like seasoned tomatoes sauce that was stirred in. I did enjoy the taste of the Chargrilled Oysters, they were deeeelicious, the most flavorful of all of what we tried and you get toasted french bread with it which is a plus in my book -the negative: the actual oysters were really tiny. Also, the cost for that size; $12.99 for six (6), is not worth the money because there wasn't much of the oysters to be had. I would order it again if the oysters themselves are bigger because they were good.

Lastly, the service. I read some reviews that said the people were awkward and they just sort of stared at you...I didn't experience that at all. The woman that was our server was very nice and pleasant and checked on us often. If we needed anything, any server walking by was glad to help. I felt the service was pretty good.

If you haven't been to Lola's, stop in. It's good food with good service."}
{"text":"The shrimp an grits are fabulous.  I come here every couple of months, an always order the same thing.  Get the shrimp and grits....trust me."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good took my mom for her Birthday to try something new my girlfriend got the gumbo it was okay. My mom got grilled catfish she enjoyed hers and I got the shrimp and grits. The food was seasoned okay for a restaurant standard not what I was expecting the food wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be since it was Louisiana creole cookong. Guess I went in expecting it to be like what I have had in Louisiana but that taste is hard to imitate. All in all I enjoyed the food though I will go back to try a Po'Boy sandwich since that is what they were on Triple D for."}
{"text":"Sign on the door says closed until further notice.  More than a little annoying 

It does look like had a health department inspection this week, don't know if it is related"}
{"text":"Excellent food with many gluten free options. Also,
the food is reasonably priced. The staff is friendly and will make great suggestions."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. I was really expecting some authentic Louisiana type food. It was but it just wasn't good. The gumbo was way too thick, as thick as gravy and everything else was just barely ok. I hated the crawpuppies, they were nothing like hush puppies at all. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Without a doubt Lolas Louisiana kitchen is outstanding. I had the bronze shrimp and grits with garlic green beans and the bacon greens and a crabcake and I have to tell you it was some of the best southern cooking I've ever had.  I would recommend to anyone who lives here in Las Vegas or anyone visiting Las Vegas to visit Lolas Louisiana kitchen you will not be disappointed.

If you pass I'm going to Lola's you have missed out on great food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Small, lively restaurant. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Not a great selection of beers, but the menu is carefully manned. We enjoyed a crab cake, a cup of Gumbo and Chhupapoulas with a fried catfish. Great."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this restaurant a great review. The first time I came to this restaurant was about three years ago and I left disappointed. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was plain and just not very good. A little less than two years ago, I went to New Orleans and had fantastic food. We went to very good restaurants and had everything from barbecue shrimp to Gouda grits to gumbo and more. It was all absolutely delicious. I loved it. Due to this, I thought... Let's give this restaurant another try. Well... I'm sorry I did. 
Lola's is terrible in comparison to the quality of food that I had in New Orleans. I ordered the shrimp and grits again. Grits should be smooth, not lumpy, and just taste like heaven. The grits at Lola's were lumpy, pasty, and the consistency was that of a dish that was left out for a few hours and has therefore hardened rather than being smooth. The taste is not very good and leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, there is a diner with a few restaurants here in town that makes grits 10 times better than Lola's. The shrimp was plain and I would not order it again. My friend ordered the barbecue shrimp with rice and did not even finish the dish because it was just OK yet she would not order it again nor would she want to come back here again. She was disappointed. We did order the fried okra as a starter and it was not bad but it was not anything to write home about. The best part of our meal was the garlic bread! Pretty sad.
We did not even bother ordering dessert.
Lola's is not a restaurant I would recommend to anyone who asks me about great Louisiana food because I have tasted way better.
The service was OK. It was slow at times.
I know that this restaurant was on DDD's, which I'm not at all impressed by, yet I think that is where a lot of the hype comes in.
I was hoping that after going to New Orleans, where we stayed several days and ate a lot of great food, I would appreciate this restaurant more. It in fact did the opposite. Maybe this is what home cooked meals are supposed to look like, which aren't very good if that is the case, but this is not at all great restaurant quality top-of-the-line New Orleans quality food and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Once again I think expectation management may be an issue for me when trying highly reviewed restaurants on Yelp. I ordered the shrimp and grits and while the shrimp was good, it was not over the top awesome. The zydeco music and Abita beer was a nice touch. I had the banana fosters bread pudding for dessert and it lived up to its billing. I think if the bill for my meal had been under $30 for one beer, the shrimp & grits, and the bread pudding I may have had a better experience."}
{"text":"I lived in New Orleans for over six years with many a return trip for the food and Lola's does an OUTSTANDING job of presenting those good, rich and full flavors in a venue I'd expect to find in Mid-City or Uptown!   My bronzed catfish with andouille and mushroom was amazing and totally made my night!"}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant from beginning to end. They even had a yummy strawberry beer on tap that had me excited to order dinner. I got the Roast Beef D'Brees which had the most tender roast beef I've ever had. Then our dessert was the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding. HOLY CRAP. For never eating bread pudding before, I must say I have been missing out. The ice cream and warm bread pudding was the perfect combo of hot and cold. To die for. Do not miss out on this gem when you go to Vegas."}
{"text":"wait, i didn't review this place yet? well, it deserves some love. 

I really love this place whenever we go to Vegas. It's off the strip and across from the LV outlets in the old Bakery (and i forgot the name). Very small and cute but it's quite the gem. On my first try, I had the Bronzed Catfish which was awesome, yet a bit on the greasy side. The grits underneath were so good with it. We've also had the crawfish hush puppies and I've had the Sweet Tea. Crawfish Crabcakes are awesome too! Pretty cool place which you don't expect in Vegas. It's hard to find good Cajun/Creole food anywhere west of the Mississippi, but this rates up there."}
{"text":"Aside from the awesome food at this place, the service is awesome.  We were in LV in September for a tradeshow and hit this place on our last night.  We were the last to be seated, so by the time we were done, the restaurant was closing up.  We had taken a cab from our hotel, but had no way back since apparently cabs can no longer be hailed in LV.  The hostess called a cab company for us, and then called again when they didn't arrive.  All of the staff was friendly and spoke to us while we waited.  After waiting for nearly an hour and still no cab, our waitress drove us home!!!  She was so sweet - waitress - I'm so sorry I can't remember your name - but you were awesome for doing that!  She took us all the way to our hotel front door and wouldn't accept any money for gas (but I hope you found that $10 we left in the backseat!)  Thank you Thank you Lolas and staff!  We will come back every year for sure!"}
{"text":"I am very happy that we finally gave Lola's a try!! This place has been on my radar for a while now.

I came here with my grandma and my daughter around 5pm on Saturday and we had zero wait time. The restaurant is a little small but it is super cute. Also, walking up to the door my 8 yr old kept saying how good it smelled. The restaurant started to fill up quickly but it was ok because our food came out already by then. 

We had the crawfish hush puppies as an appetizer and enjoyed them a lot, especially the dipping sauce. 

My daughter ordered a cup of gumbo and she LOVED it! 

I had the trio with red beans and rice, gumbo and crawfish ettouffe and my grandma ordered the same. My favorite by far was the red beans and rice. I was very happy with that and felt like I should have just ordered that. The gumbo and ettouffe was good too but I love the beans and rice. Oh yeah, the buttered bread is amazing too. 

We also ordered banana pudding to go but I haven't tried it yet because I am so full lol. 

I plan on coming back and trying to charbroiled oysters and maybe a po' boy. 

This place is legit."}
{"text":"Love love love the bronzed catfish and grits! I go to vegas alot for business and before even checking in at the hotel we hit Lolas! Service is awesome but I will say not any of the normal servers were there last time and with my tattoos and casual look I didn't get the great service we are used to having I think because other folks who look like they tip well we're being served alot faster and more often checked on.. I do tip very well so that was a big mistake. But I still love lolas and will be back often!"}
{"text":"First time coming to Lola's, and I must say it's the next best thing to New Orleans food you gonna get in the desert...Ordered the fried shrimp poBoy and Char broiled oysters...food was great..my girl ordered the jambalaya, spicy but good. .If you can't make it to New orleans, its the next best thing. Service was friendly and nice. We went in the middle of the week during lunch hours, we were sitted right away and our order came out quick. Oh btw our server was Jennifer she was awesome!!"}
{"text":"First time eating catfish.  Service was good, ordered catfish and grits ... very tasty (but, found that catfish was not my favorite fish) HOWEVER, Lola's Bread Pudding w/ vanilla ice cream was fantastic.  Go for the fish and stay for the Bread Pudding!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Cajun-styled food, this is definitely the place to go to in Vegas. The food tasted so authentic and delicious, both entrees and dessert! Also, our waitress Lisa was incredibly friendly and polite! I would come back to this place again just for their customer service!"}
{"text":"Mrs. Fishstick suggested this place......so I went.

Food was delicious.  Honestly if you don't like this place.....do yourself a favor and go treat yourself to a $1 menu cheeseburger somewhere because that is the type of food your palette desires.  However, if you enjoy good food, southern food in particular, this little place won't let you down.  We had:

1.  Crabcake - crisp on the outside, moist (Mrs. Fishstick hates that word) on the inside with a spicy remolaude.  

2.  Crawpuppies - crisp little balls of crawfish, breading and seasoning with an adequate dipping sauce.

3.  Softshell crab poboy - two softshell crabs fried GBD.  We had to ask for extra mayo but they were very tasty.

4.  Shrimp n grits - AMAZING.  The shrimp n grits here are among the best entrees I've had in Vegas.  A feat in itself was getting Mrs. Fishstick to eat them.  She was reluctant to try saying \"I don't like grits\" but these white, creamy gems are akin to something else of similar description she enjoys a lot so I insisted she tried.  And......she liked them!!!

Good job Lola's Louisiana Kitchen.  Excellent food!!!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Food was excellent. Had crab cake and sizzling ham po boy. Both were great. Banana foster dessert was delicious. Definitely would come back. Only bad thing food took a little longer than expected. Not quick but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place was disgusting. I got the shrimp and grits and it was a bowl full of oil. There was also barely any flavor to anything, and that's the antithesis of what Creole food should taste like. My friend got the fried chicken and his was much better than mine, but why is fried chicken the better option at a Creole place? Still looking in Vegas for something better."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious.  Had a D-Brese and shrimp and grits.  For dessert we had bananas foster bread pudding.  We had good service and the food was great. I am knocking off a start because we had to sit in the hallway and it was hot (112 outside and maybe 90 inside).  We were told is was air-conditioned but all we saw were fans.  The fan closest to us was removed to bring in a party of 6. You need a reservation!"}
{"text":"I had BBQ shrimp!!!! OMG sooo spicy and delish a must try for sure.  Our waitress was very nice and informative .  My friend had jambalaya pretty freaking good.  Banana pudding was the shiz!!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is must visit if your in vegas.  It's close to downtown and the strip of Charleston.   Reservations are encouraged.  Loved the service that we received even though we arrived 40min before close.  Food is delicous.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Finally.  My \"Cajun Quest\" is meeting better results.  Located in what used to be the old Holsum Bakery, Lola's was not too far out, and I was definitely more on track to getting (for me) what the flavor should be like.  Yes, I am picky when it comes to my Southern type food.

I had a nice lunch here last week.  A small one, but it worked.  I tried their gumbo, and it was good.  I thought it was nice and meaty, but I wanted just a little more flavor.  Overall, I did like it.  I think a shot of Tabasco would have gone a long way, but that's on me.

The jambalaya, however, was some seriously good stuff.  THAT got my face a little flushed, and I scarfed that down with gusto.

The place itself is respectable.  Nice little patio with some good ol' fashioned jazz playing.  I've heard they do live bands on the weekends, which I will have to check out.  The service was also not.  Very helpful, not pushy, and certainly knew the food.  Being a newcomer, I try to go off of recommendations, and what the waiter suggested suited me just fine.

I will certainly try them again, and go for some of the other items on the menu.  I had a light lunch, but it was a very satisfactory meal, and one that I would definitely try again in the future.  

A brief, but pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"I think I died and went to Heaven.  
Place is very cute, informal, clean with great and happy staff.
We ordered Chargrilled oysters, they were just as good as the ones you get in New Orleans.  I ordered bronzed shrimp & Gouda grits with andouille & mushroom ragout.  My DH ordered bronzed shrimp and jambalaya, for dessert we got bananas foster bread pudding."}
{"text":"Next time I'm in Vegas, I hope I can talk my group into going outside of the casino and visiting Lola's.  Or maybe I'll leave them and go myself.  I'm a bit fan of Creole cooking and when I found Lola's, it was a no brainer to check it out.

The staff was very nice and helpful.  

I got a starter and a dinner.  Sorry, no room for dessert.

Crawpuppies:   A little expensive for the small order.  They don't look pretty, in fact they look a little burnt.  Don't let that fool you.  These things were soft and tasty on the inside.  They come with an aioli, but I decided to go with a hot sauce.  You choose.  You can't go wrong.  

Shrimp and Crawfish Etouffee:  It's always a great staple at any Creole restaurant and if you can't make this, you should shut the doors.  The only thing that would have made this better was a ladle so I could have put more in my mouth at once.  It'll be hard to come here and not get this dish again."}
{"text":"Let's start with the food, well it's actually pretty good, it's close to what you will actually find in the Big Easy, it's not up to the standard of some of the good New Orleans restaurants but it's pretty good.

I had the BBQ shrimp, which is 5 shrimp (of a good size) on white rice with a BBQ sauce...For $16...Yeah the price is a little steep for what you get, but it was good. Now it did instantly remind me of the shrimp dish I had at Grind Brgr Bar in Palm Springs, just not as good and 3 times the price.

The wife had the Shrimp and grits....Yeah she is a good southern girl...Wanna be, her Cali heritage though actually liked the dish, again 5 shrimp, grits, for $16...

For dessert we went for the bread pudding, now, this is the star of the place, it's probably the best bread pudding I have eaten, period, so if you are a bread pudding lover then head over there just for that.

Now you are probably wondering why only 3 stars, well, the service.....

Holy crap, we could have easily walked out of the place without paying the bill, despite being seated in front of the waiter station, for whatever reason our waitress decided that we were to be ignored, I actually had to call someone over to ask if she had died....

I should have guessed it was going to be this way when the busser took our drink order, told us \"\"\"\" would be our waitress, then after a while he took our order and delivered the food...then refill drinks, even though by this time he was actually off the clock and in street clothes ready to go home.....And the bill....Yep he dropped of the bill...In fact the only time she actually showed was to collect the bill....

Now sure, wait staff can get busy, but this is a small place, you would really have to be trying for the wait staff to lose you...

But she actually managed to top her no existent service act...She performed an act that is becoming a little bit of a common problem out her...

The bill was $63.48, $100 bill given, change was $36.....Hold on a second, where are the coins...Yeah, for whatever reason she decided to kept the coins...

This has happened a few times at other places. normally a quick \"hey you shorted me on my change, but I will just take it out of your tip, grab it from the register\" seems like a quick way, but how do you tip someone that hasn't done anything except pick up the bill ???

Well the wife is nicer than me, let's leave it at that...

But overall, good food, horrible service except for the busser (or maybe he was a waiter going off shift, not 100% sure)."}
{"text":"Lots of potential but they need to pay more attention to details. We have eaten there three times, so I cannot say I don't like it but so far it has been a mixed bag. It is close to my house and I grew up on this kind of food.

REALLY GOOD: Charbroiled oysters, Fried Oysters, Catfish, French Fries and the BBQ shrimp (twice). Bread Pudding is as good as I have ever had...Damn near perfect!

NOT AS GOOD: Gumbo is tasty but needs to be darker. Fried Crawpuppies tend to come out still cold in the center. BBQ shrimp (third time) had to be sent back. Crabcakes are full of bread but this is NOLA  style not Baltimore. I know they are having problems with the bread getting stale unless it is grilled or toasted.

PRETTY BAD: The Crawfish Etouffee was terrible, very few crawfish and the gravy tasted of nothing but ready-made under cooked roux, YUCK!   The Sweet Potato Pie was pasty and insipid and the crust would make a Cajun Nana cringe.

I will definitely give them another shot and I hope they iron out the problems. But I cannot recommend without caveats."}
{"text":"Good cajun food. The place is small and gets packed for lunch and dinner. The wait is worth it. 

The bar is tiny and  not real functional. However their selection of Abita beer from Louisiana is outstanding. Always try the seasonal. 

The gumbo is and etouffe is good. I had the half shrimp and half crawfish. The crab cake was ok. It was seasoned well but I prefer lump meat crab cakes. The breading here was too much for me."}
{"text":"This was our first time here..I ordered the crab cake and the jumbalaya w/ shrimp.. It was so good!! I really have nothing to compare it to because I have never been to a cajun place other than Razzoo's but I normally just get fried pickles and cat fish.  I have had crab cakes from other places but here the crab cake was super good!! Anywho Because this was our first time here we gave our waitress Dianna a hard time asking her all kinds of questions.. But she hung in there like a champ and really helped us out and was pretty patient with us..  We will def come back here!!"}
{"text":"I really liked Lola's.  I wanted to hit up all the Triple D's in the area and Lola's was on the list.  I am not sure how \"authentic\" the n'awlins fare is (and I've been to NOLA) but the ambiance is nice, the waitstaff is pleasant, and the food is great.

I had the gouda grits and the roast beef po'boy.   When I was in New Orleans in the late 80's, the po'boy seemed to be a gimmick offering that was all about just making a huge, almost un-finish-able sandwich piled so high with meat that you could not even get your jaws around.

At Lola's, the sandwich is more about making an amazing tasting sandwich vs just a huge sandwich.  It is covered in a heavy gravy and stuffed with high quality ingredients.  It was extremely tasty and I finished the whole thing (unlike po buys I had in NO).  The gouda grits were great, nothing like the typical bland grits (sorry, southerners) you get most places.  The cheese really makes this dish pop.

Since I was travelling for work, I was only one person and they sat me in a little 2-seat table by the 'bar', which was perfect for me.

I saw Lola at the door, greeting and saying goodby to customers, which was nice.  I saw one lady with a midwestern accent telling her \"I saw you on TV\" and she was very nice and accomodating to all of the guests.

I would definitely come back.  In fact, I debated coming back for a 2nd trip during my week+ in Vegas, which is a rule I almost never break (I try to sample a new place every night and not go back to any place I've already tried).  I want to try something with shrimp next time..."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I ordered the catfish platter and to my disbelief it was not cooked all the way. The waiter apologized and took it back to the kitchen. They cooked another one and  a different waiter brought it to the table and said I hope its cooked as you would like it.  Really uncalled for at a time when I could of made a big deal of it. The second fish was cooked this time but no season. It was bland like they floured it and put it in the grease. The manager was brought to the table and I explained what was going on. She just looked at the fish while I was telling her I was not paying for this. She didn't say sorry she just took the plate and brought it back to the kitchen. She took the fish off the bill but charged me for the sides. I'm like really. I paid and left."}
{"text":"I just had my 2nd lunch at Lola's and I love this place.   The food is yummy and obviously fresh and well prepared.   Service is great.  You MUST save room for the bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Amazing Gouda grits , the crusted trout was \"the business!\" From the homemade banana pudding(yes, the pudding is from scratch - like Grandma used to make!) to the awesome banana's foster, my family are foodies and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals and each other's  high 5 and thumbs from The Wallace's"}
{"text":"Great little place, will definitely be going back.  Wife had the blackened catfish and I had the jambalaya.  Crawpuppy app was great.  Everything was excellent and the service was great."}
{"text":"This place has changed hands and incarnations so many times.  Currently, it's a Louisiana-inspired place.  Tasty food, but pretty pricey for lunch.  I don't think I will be going there again unless someone else is picking up the tab."}
{"text":"Food is great just wish it was bigger and you didnt have to call to make a reservation"}
{"text":"Some of the best Cajun food west of New Orleans! Heard about this place on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and it was absolutely worth finding this place! Make reservations though, cuz they are packed most nights. I had the bronzed shrimp with grits....mmmmm...couldn't get enough! The grits are made with gouda cheese and I wanted more, more, more ~ also make sure to try the fig delight dessert.....soooo yummy! It's like having a warm homemade fig newton....only way better!! I will definitely eat here again and again when I'm back in Vegas~"}
{"text":"Been here twice and plan on coming back. The first time I got fried oyster po boy with fries and a lemonade. The second time I got a grilled shrimp po boy. Both times the bread was warm and soft. The grilled shrimp was very tasty it had some seasoning but not too much to over do it. 

Service isn't bad but around lunch time it does get busy. The area is pretty small so it does get packed quick, but there are some tables outside."}
{"text":"May have found a new favorite place!

The service here was outstanding even though it was a Saturday night and they were super busy.
 I made reservations for 630, the earliest they could get me in was 715, I arrived about 7 o'clock at about 705 my table was ready!

For starters we ordered the small bowl of gumbo to share and the crab and artichoke dip, they were both amazing. 

My wife ended up ordering the gumbo dinner and I ordered the shrimp and crawfish ettafee(spelling?) that was just incredible as well, a bit spicy but I loved it!

This was our first experience at Louisiana style food and we just loved it! We will definitely be back to try all of the other items on the menu we are looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"After seeing them on Dirty Dinning and there poor response and excuses... NEVER go there again!!!  What where they thinking., to many options to go somewhere else and not get sick"}
{"text":"Just so everyone knows...I had high expectations for this place due to all of the reviews. I was so EXCITED to go to this place after I looked at the menu it was RIDICULOUS. From the beginning to end it was bad

1.When we walked in on a Wednesday as soon as they opened there were two people on the patio and two people inside. It was a great day outside and we thought to sit outside first but our waitress WHISKED us inside so quickly we didn't get a second to make up our mind.We sat down to figure out that their air conditioning was on ARCTIC so I told her if we could go outside. SHE LITERALLY ROLLED HER EYES...and said \"IT'S A LITTLE WINDY, BUT IF YOU LIKE THAT THEN..\" ummm ma'am take us outside please!

2.This was our first time there and my bf was having trouble deciding so we took a little longer to order. Her coming EVERY 5 seconds didn't help. If I were her, I would've maybe suggested an item on the menu or even ask if she could help in any way..NOPE.

3.I ordered the crawfish hush puppies to start and jambalaya with added shrimp. My bf ordered the fried shrimp with the fried oyster, and crab cake. He asked for gritz and greens on the side. The crawfish puppies were interesting.I don't eat crawfish much so I'm not exactly sure how they supposed to taste so I'll just describe what it tasted like.Tart.The jambalaya came and LOOKED very promising.That jambalaya HURT MY FEELINGS. It was the mushiest, no flavor having jambalaya I have EVER TASTED. This jambalaya was the WORST ever. It taste like tomato and mushy rice. The chicken was very small and the shrimp just had no taste to it. My bf's food was COOKED perfectly.His fish was crunchy on the outside, flaky on the inside. He took his first bite and said \"It needs A LOT of hot sauce\" I tasted that fish and AGAIN no flavor! I mean..NONE I was soooooooo confused because Cajun food usually has SO MUCH FLAVOR..He used half their bottle of hot sauce to give that fish flavor.He taste the grits and actually sent them back because they were so bad. Just so you know my bf isn't the type to send food back. He rather just pour a lot of salt and pepper on it and \"make it work\" Needless to say, after that HORRIBLE meal and the $70 bill we were done.

On the car ride home, I was sad. I kept saying 'I could've made some Zatarains jambalaya that was better than that\"!!


*After I came out of my depression a couple of days later, I went to the OYSTER BAR in the PALACE STATION and ordered the jambalaya and my bf ordered the gumbo. I PROMISE you the HEAVENS SANG! I felt like I was born again. That jambalaya was the ABSOLUTE BEST JAMBALAYA ever. My bf became extremely quiet when we were eating and when I looked up...I SWEAR TO BABY JESUS he was chewing with his eyes closed nodding his head in pleasure! If you want some cajun food..GO THERE!"}
{"text":"OMG! Saw the on DDD so I had to check them out when I went to Vegas. Food was amazing, atmosphere was great, servers were friendly. I was glad I arrived when the Crawfish was available. I also had to be a fatty and try the Shrimp & Grits as well. Both incredibly amazing dishes. My wife got the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich and fell in Love. Keep up the good work Lola's!"}
{"text":"The shrimp & grits are the most famous thing on the menu but if you eat on the lighter side, get the shrimp ramlouade and crab cake. It's the perfect amount of food. Oh, I also got the gumbo which wasn't light but it was darn good. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Food was OK. I hear they are building a new place. I'm happy to hear that because this one is rather small.  I am not a fan of the gumbo. Maybe it was a bad day. The catfish was good. I went one day during lunch. I'd like to go back for dinner and give it another try. The one thing that bothered me is that when I went back to work, I smelled like fried food the re"}
{"text":"This popular New Orleans inspired restaurant has been calling me for 3 years. Finally I navigated into the Holsom shopping center for a taste.  Apparently everyone likes this place too as there was no immediate parking.  After 10 minutes of parking lot stalking I found a spot and went inside.  The dining room is small and jam packed with tables. It actually reminded me of some of the places I sampled ages ago when I was in New Orleans.  The menu has po' boy sandwiches, gumbo, creole, remoulade, catfish and more NOLA favorites.  The restaurant has been featured on Diner's Drive ins and Dives and the owner comes from New Orleans.  The wait staff was excellent.  Although they seemed like they were running around like a chicken with its head cut off, they all took time to ask how I was doing.  My waitress suggested the Bronzed Catfish and grits and I took the bait.  

Due to the crowd, the wait for my meal was longer than I would have liked for lunch and I received several apologies from the waitress and the manager.  When the meal came, it was truly worth the wait.  The grits had absorbed the flavor of the well cooked catfish and the gouda/mushroom mixture.  The catfish was well seasoned with a light coating that didn't overpower the fish. 

The bread was an afterthought and did not add anything to the meal but did assist in cleaning the last bites of grits off the plate.

I would have liked it to have more of a cajun kick and will definitely try a spicier option the next trip out.

I only have one New Orleans experience and it was in the early 90's so I am not an expert on New Orleans cuisine by any means but I can say I enjoyed Lolas and will return soon.  For lunch you can expect to pay between $9.00 for the least expensive Po'boy to $16.00 for the catfish and grits."}
{"text":"A bit off the beaten path but oh so worth it. The turn into the lot is a bit tricky too but the Gumbo was ohhh so good! Wish I ordered the meal instead of the bowl. The crawfish hush puppies were good, a bit a heat but just right. And for my entree, I had the Shrimp n Grits. Everything was yummy, worth the trek off the strip. I will defs be back for the Gumbo!"}
{"text":"WOW were we happy to be going to see our good friend in Vegas...for 2 months we have been wanting to go to  Lolas. The small restaurant ..maybe 13 tables and a small bar area....2 waitresses and a few kitchen staff....

Ok Drive ins Diners and Dives..get real...this place is so bad....Guy you should be careful of the recommends you dish out.

Good thing we were not starving because we went home wanting for soooo much more from this lunch experience had to offer....

cesar salad......boring basic and tiny..
blackened catfish with side of slaw and greens.....thee cat fish was not blackened it tasted no better than Zatarans cajun seasoning mix...no cruch or blackening what so ever....boring and small ...the greens   so basic   none of the flavors of bacon as stated in the menu ..just salt lingering from the cat fish....the slaw was drippy with mayo and basic....boring.
The oyster poorboy...tasted ok...small...but better than anything else on the table...but 
NOW HERES THE REAL BIG PROBLEM   ... the stupid fries took a bad meal to a BAD EXPERIENCE...simple problem...the fries with the poorboy were cold..the waitress said she would bring another side...and to continue eating and she would bring a fresh HOT order...30 minutes later no fries..the waitress says 'she messed up and she would bring them right away...10 minutes later no fires....ok no worries   we were so far from in love with this joke of a restaurant that we said remove them from the bill and we are outta here...NOT SO EASY......THE WAITRESS SAID SHE PAI D FOR THE FRIES HER SELF..LIKE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ..ALL BUT 60  CENTS WERE STILL ON THE BILL...WTF?   ok at this point there was no reasoning to be had....we are angry the waitress is daft and the woman who said she could function as the manager was of no help....10 minutes of having a 'situation' they deducted 4$ from the ticket we were free to get the hell outta that crappy place,,

bad food   bad service and apparantly a lousy non concerned cook staff....who the hell is managing this place????

NEVER AGAIN.......THIS DAFT STAFF SHOULD ALL BE FIRED!!!

DID I SAY HOW MUCH I DSLIKE THIS PLACE?"}
{"text":"Best creole food i've had outside of Louisiana itself. The Only thing I did not like was the Gouda cheese in the grits. I feel they should use a less stronger cheese, like parmesan or pepper jack, any thing light. the gouda cheese was very strong in the grits. besides that HOT DAMN! it was delicious ."}
{"text":"A hidden gem just off I-15 at Charleston. This was my first visit. My wife and I will be going back again and again. If you like southern food, this IS the place for you. Try it. You won't be disappointed -- 10 stars for the food and 11 for the service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Shrimp N Grits as good as the first time.
Abita Amber is a nice beer.
Sweet Potato Pie with Pecans was tasty."}
{"text":"It's ridiculous and fabulous and everything you want an authentic New Orleans restaurant to be.  

  The food is fantastic. All of it.

  If you are OK with fabulous food, cramped quarters and a potential wait- go..

 Oh and hey, Geaux Saints!"}
{"text":"Lola's is a diner with great creole food. If you want to eat at 12pm, make reservations. The crab cake dinner was very good and the mixed greens underneath was a pleasant surprise. The catfish and grits was also wonderful with the ragout adding to the flavor of the grits."}
{"text":"Came in here today on a whim with my mom. The first impression of this place was that it was pretty unassuming. Decorated in a Mardi Gras style with the purple gold and green colors.  Luckily we got there before the crowd did so we're we're seated immediately. 
We decided to share the D'Brees po'boy aka the roast beef one, gumbo and, the Gouda grits. It came out pretty fast we couldn't help but notice how fast the restaurant filled up. The servers were running around like crazy trying to keep up and doing a great job. 
The po'boy was fantastic. The meat was perfectly tender and the gravy with it was awesome. The lightly toasted bread had great texture and flavor. The gumbo cup was super tasty.  It was rich and flavorful loaded with sausage, chicken and, okra. The rice on the bottom added a nice balance to the dish.  The grits reminded me of a risotto. They were perfectly done. Not too runny or too set. The flavor was well balance and the addition of the cheese was a masterful touch. 
Lola's does Cajun and creole food right. It is simple and yet extremely flavorful. We will definitely come back to try more things."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious food full of lively cajun flavors and spices.  Wait staff was friendly and informative.   My only complaint was I was still very hungry after finishing my meal.  I highly recommend the bronze shrimp and grits but the real treat ( that everyone should experience) is the bananas foster bread pudding!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after attending the Olympia Expo, and we were extremely impressed. The location is tucked away and easy to miss, but the atmosphere is very welcoming once you walk in. The service was great. The hostess Lisa was very welcoming and displayed the Southern hospitality you only experience in the South. My main craving was mud bugs, but since they were out of season, I settled on the shrimp and Gouda grits which were the best tasting shrimp and grits I've had outside of Charleston SC. My wife and I devoured our food and enjoyed some LA beers they had on tap before rolling out of the place fat and happy. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and very nice staff. I tried the catfish/sausage plate and it was good. Not melt in your mouth goodness, but I'd definitely try it again. I also tried the pecan pumpkin slice with the chantilly cream on top, but the cream tasted IMMENSELY AWFUL!!! It tasted spoiled and left such a bad taste in my mouth that I felt like I needed to hurl. YUCK!!"}
{"text":"***Ok, but NOT authentic!***  LSU grad, Lafayette native here. Lola's is the kind of place that I suspect was founded by a South Louisiana native who then passed off the kitchen to someone who didn't grow up eating mawmaw's cooking in Crowley and doesn't really know what it's supposed to taste like. They try hard, but the flavors are just off. Gumbo has the same bland gravy flavor that most places have. They have a great atmosphere and lots of varieties of Abita, but the food is overpriced and doesn't have any soul to it. Recommendation: Get some nonviolent felon old man out of Angola to cook for ya, Lola."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with what used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  First their fan was not working so the place was full of smoke, I ordered the same thing I order every time and the waitress brought the wrong dish and said \"this is what I wrote down if you want something else you will have to pay\", are you kidding.  Well I was not in the mood to argue so I ate the meal I did not order.  The grits were terrible, clumpy and had three pieces of sausage which I counted because I was already pissed off, and the portion was much smaller than it used to be. My friend enjoyed her meal ( the same thing she gets every time) which is why I gave two stars ... but Lola's... you lost a repeat customer there are other cajan places to try."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem really offers some tasty food. It is right off of Charleston and the interstate 15. Super close to work too which works great for lunch. I have eaten here twice now and been satisfied both times. It is not a very big place, but quaint and good service. I love the Guy Fieri signature on the top of the ceiling. All kinds of southern dishes to choose from. I am not that acquainted with southern food but I do enjoy some red beans/rice/andouille sausage!

This time I was a bit hungry and selected the platter that came with chicken, salmon or shrimp and your choice of two sides. I selected the grilled shrimp, coleslaw and fries. My friend enjoyed the same platter with salmon. Our server was Andy and he was really friendly and helpful. When the entrees arrived, there was chicken on my plate and not a shrimp in sight. Andy admitted he had made a mistake and promptly informed me he would change it. I told him it was ok, I would eat the chicken. He bent over backwards and still served me the grilled to perfection shrimp and did not charge me. Wow! So kind of him. The coleslaw was also very tasty but the fries unfortunately tasted old and tired. I only had a couple and then stopped eating them. The four stars is all about Andy and the great customer service he provided. Thanks again Andy! The southern hospitality you provided was definitely worth another visit!"}
{"text":"When ever I'm in Las Vegas I have to stop at this little small restaurant Lolas it's a little hard to find well u can drive rite pass it but once u been there u never forget close to the strip and outlet mall. But it has the best Grits n Mushroom with ragu sauce I can just scream the cheese  and creamy grits just melt in my mouth the mushrooms have a meaty taste like sausage I strongly suggest you try them along with some chicken breast and bread pudding delicious oh n don't forget the red beans n  rice with French bread"}
{"text":"Purchased the catfish platter and online it has 3 catfish filets listed, but I received 2. When I called asking for my 3rd piece I was told the online menu is wrong and wasn't accommodated or compensated for their error. Also we ordered at 12 noon when they opened and received soggy fries. Overall the food was good, but they have poor customer service."}
{"text":"I needed some legit food after eating cafeteria food all day at the convention center. Thankfully, my homegirl (who is a local brought me here). We were able to make reservations  an hour before arriving and got sat right away. The restaurant is pretty small so I definitely recommend that if you're going with a big party. 

If you're coming here, I must insist that you get their baked oysters. I dont know what kind of sauce, cheese, or voodoo maguc they have on there, but it is crack! We split a dozen pieces between us two tiny girls, but I could've easily packed down a dozen myself. It paired really well with the bread. I was trying to dip my excess sauce from the oysters on it too.

Don't get discouraged when you see their flaming fire sign on their menu. If you're a big spicy eater, I'd compare this to a mild you'd find at boiling crab or soon du bu. For entrees, it looks like everyone goes for either the shrimp & grits or the catfish & grits. My friend got the catfish option. Their catfish was delicious. It wasn't deep fried, but still had a nice crisp texture on the outside. I was craving some pasta and got the shrimp charlotte. Its a light mushroom based sauce with shrimp on top of angel hair. I really enjoyed this dish (mainly because im such a huge mushrooms and angel hair fan). I definitely recommend this dish to pasta lovers, but if you want something more hearty, I would push you to try one of the grits. Overall, great call on my friend's part. Definitely see myself coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Yes Yes Yes!!! Finally a place I can say I had some authentic Cajun food in this town. My family is from Louisiana and so I still frequent the Big Easy a lot. I've been looking for some real Cajun food in Las Vegas for a while. I've tried some imitators in the Spring Mountain area but they have their own Asian take on Cajun. Lola's however is the real deal. My party and I split some red beans and rice, jambalaya and crawfish etouffee and I have to say it was superb!!.. Granted I'm sure I've had some better dishes in the French Quarter, but I think thats mainly a subjective opinion. I felt like I was back at home here. It's a small casual place with some hints of the \"Who Dat\" Saints, Mardi Gras beads and they were also playing zydeco music. I was going to take pictures and remembered only after I had cleaned every plate clean. Needless to say, I am VERY happy to finally have found my Cajun spot in Vegas.  Prices were fair as well! If you like Cajun, get your derriere down to Lolas and laissez les bon temps rouler!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in several years, so I thought I'd give it a go.  I stopped eating here after being disappointed after several tries. I really really really want to like this place - but it just doesn't work for me. The food just does not compare to the good stuff in Louisiana, sorry. Maybe if you've never been to NOLA this suffices.

Wait staff was nice, but slow. Sat for five or ten minutes before asked for a drink choice. Chargrilled oysters overcooked with no oyster flavor, the seasonings overpower. Friend was disappointed in flavorless jambalaya. I will say the shrimp/crawfish etouffee was decent.

Sorry, Lola's, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I are lovers of New Orleans food so when we saw that we could get chargrilled oysters in Vegas, we were really excited.  

The restaurant is small, strangely laid out and the service was sub-par. My husband got a Caesar salad and oysters. His salad was great and it came out quickly. Then- we waited and waited and waited. Finally his oysters came out. They weren't that impressive and left him feeling hungry. My cheese poboy and grits finally came out after he was done eating. Much to my disappointment, I got a grilled cheese (not a poboy- dressed as requested) and some cold, soggy fries. The grits were okay. 

They comped my meal, so that was appreciated."}
{"text":"Not completely authentic, but the most authentic Cajun/creole restaurant I have eaten at in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was great...made a reservation to ensure our seat. Wasn't too crowded the day we went. Host didn't even need to check for reservation."}
{"text":"I am not a southern girl but I know good food. And Lola's is the best southern cooking in Las Vegas. It is small and the service is very good. We always make sure we have reservations when we want to go there. I had the bronzed Catfish and Gouda grits, with a side of greens it was exceptional.  My husband my friend had bronzed shrimp and Gouda grits and my friend s boyfriend had the étouffée.    Every one thought the choice was the best and a good time was had by all."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. The service was great, the waitress was very friendly and attentive. Our whole party was raving about their food, and were very full and satisfied by the end of their meals. I ordered the deep fried soft-shelled crab, and my wife ordered the gumbo. Both of the dishes were delicious. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Better than every Cajun style restaurant I've eaten in, in New Orleans! Shrimp & Smoked Gouda Grits with Mushroom Ragu is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I think I probably just had a really bad experience here as a first timer. I ordered gumbo which was OK (I still prefer the oyster bar at palace or Texas station) and a combo platter that consists of fried catfish, fried shrimps, fried oysters, and crab cake for $25. I only ate the 2 shrimps and one fried oyster. The crab cake was fishy and the catfish tasted like dirt off the ground and I'm not really into that. I figured I could ask for some lemon and squeeze onto my crab cake to kill some of the fishy taste and next thing you know...the guy took out a container of lemon and DUG UNWASHED BARE HIS HAND INTO IT to get me my lemons. Can somebody say \"HEALTH CODE VIOLATION?!\"...boy like I'm going to be using those lemons now...meaning, I just paid and left with a full plate of food on the table. 

SERVICE: I'd give this place a 2 star for service. They were not very attentive to our party and they forgot our side twice. 

Maybe it was an off day for them, but the food and the service wasn't appealing enough for me to even remotely want to go back there again."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try Lola's and my friend's birthday was the perfect opportunity! Since there were 4 of us, we decided to go all-out and try a ton of menu items. We made a reservation for Saturday night and were greeted by Lola, herself, at the door. The place is tiny, cozy, and adorable; a true hole in the wall. Here is the low-down on the meal:

Crab cake - I am VERY picky about my crab cakes and these were delicious! Lots of crab and not a lot of filler. A beautiful sear on both sides and the lemon aioli was fantastic. The crab cakes were second only to my own.

Craw-puppies - hush-puppies with Crawfish mixed in the batter, very inventive! These were crispy and delicious, but maybe a touch too soft/undercooked in the middle.

Gumbo - The gumbo looked good and started off great on my palate, but lacked seasoning, mainly salt, and spice.

Catfish and grits - OMG the cheesy grits were unbelievable, I literally did not want to eat the last bite. The catfish was cooked perfectly, but not exactly what I expected. They even gave me some crispy bread to soak everything up. 

My dining companions had Po-boys and raved about the bread. I was able to steal some french fries and was so glad I did, they were fantastic. My husband had the trout, it wasn't bad but it was a little on the fishy side for me. 

Sweet Potato Pecan Pie - I wish there was more sweet potato and less pecan, but paired with the chantilly cream it was delicious and I found myself constantly going back for just one more bite.

Lola's Famous Bread Pudding - I am not a fan of bread pudding, but my friends forced me to take a bite and it really wasn't bad.

Banana's Foster - The highlight of dessert, we were literally watching each spoonful and silently hating each other for having good taste! It was the best banana's foster I have ever had. A delicious sweet brown sugar coating with the warm bananas and cold vanilla ice cream...yes please!

Overall, Lola's is a great Cajun alternative to the real deal. There were definitely some high points to the meal, but there were a few mediocre points as well. I wish they had live jazz, that would really create some true NOLA ambiance. I will definitely be back to check out more of the menu and I am so glad we have a great Cajun restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere!  The Gouda grits are unbelievable.... As are the grilled oysters, the po-boys and all the desserts.  Bread puddings are all great and the fig delight the best fig newton you can ever have.   Lola's is a \"must\" every time I come home to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely bomb.

They do all the cajun classics and they do them very, very well.

This location is absolutely TINY. Make a reservation before you head here (especially if it's not a day where you could stand to sit outside)."}
{"text":"What a fantastic little place! 

Worth the trip off the strip. Best gumbo I've ever had outside New Orleans. I wish I had pictures to show you but, my family and I devoured everything faster than I could take pictures.

Ask for Lisa! She's a doll and a wonderful guide for your experience!"}
{"text":"It's small but the food is so worth it.  We ordered the crawpuppies, crab artichoke dip, Gouda grits, Jambalaya, a crab cake, and the roast beef po' boy and we shared and sampled everything. It was all ridiculously delicious and extremely reasonably priced.  I cannot express how good the food was and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out because it was on DDD and I was in Vegas.

Sweet tea was good & free refills!

Loved the crab cake and crab artichoke dip for starters 

Bronzed catfish and grits were good! BF had the Shrimp Charlotte.

Banana Foster was good too loved he ice cream!

Took the crab Po'Boy to go!

Will be visiting again whenever I come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Lolas has to be one of my FAVORITE restaurants in Las Vegas. They have GREAT customer service and the food is D-Lish. I highly recommend the Crab Artichoke Dip-Ummm you can taste the freshness in every bite. Lot's of crab inside..you'll want more TRUST me. Another great dish is"}
{"text":"The best tasting cajun food I've ever tasted! It was so easy to find and they have just obtained a loyal customer for life."}
{"text":"Im down with this place.
I like sitting outside. And I like their crab sandwiches... Poor crabs, they don't have a chance. 

I have tried the crab po-boy, and the shrimp and grits. Both fantastic.
Have only been twice , but from what I experienced they deserve a good rating. 

My mom lost her credit card there once and the staff totally found it and returned it very next day. Great people, nice city view, in the boarders of the art's district."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. Nice staff, we were greeted at the door and sat immediately. Our waitress Lisa was nice and recommended their top dishes. We went with the Shrimp and Grits and the roast beef po boy. Both were really good and had some great flavor. My husband and I also shared a bowl of their gumbo for an appetizer, that as well did not disappoint. I've never had grits I actually like. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit and although 1st time was a disappointment I'm definitely a fan. I first stopped by last year right after a trip to New Orleans, was super excited to see barbecue shrimp on the menu. It ended up being a big let down - think it was $17 or $18 for 4 shrimp in a not spicy sauce and a huge mound of rice. I left feeling a little ripped off- it felt like that should've been a $12 appetizer vs an entree.  
I went with friends for lunch last week and LOVE Lola's now. We were seated outside and I think the server forgot about us for a while. But the food made up for it. I had the soft shell crab po boy - huge, bread was cut in half with 1 crab in each so perfect for sharing. Crispy yummy crab on their light flaky bread. I got the potato salad, which was just ok. Fries were also mediocre, but sweet potato fries were possibly the best I've ever had. Had some of my friends fried shrimp po boy too - only 4 shrimp total, which is a little skimpy but the shrimp were pretty fat and super sweet. 
Also tried a bite of someones blackened catfish. I've never been a fan of catfish but this was so spicy and flavorful I'd totally order it next time.
Rhythm kitchen is still my fav Creole place in town but I'm loving Lola's for their po boys. Oh and the buttered grilled bread they bring you is also a must"}
{"text":"What a great find Lola's was while we stayed in Vegas. We love creole food! The Gouda grits were like a dream, & I'm not even a fan of them. I could eat those all day long even though cheese is not my friend. I enjoyed my jambalaya & my husband really loved his shrimp po-boy. They don't have a kids menu so the kids shared a burger (so good) and we also tried the craw puppies, although we would never get them again as they are not worth the price. They were delicious though.

Service was top notch and quick on a Thursday despite not having reservations. It's just a short drive from the busy part of the strip. Their happy hour had some good beers too."}
{"text":"We made an unneeded reservation via Yelp and came a little early. Plenty of seating. What drove me to come was the chargrilled oysters which were definitely disappointing. They were Unshucked and were the size of quarters. Hardly worthy of a $24 a dozen prize tag. 

Decor was awesome. Love the LSU and saints gear!"}
{"text":"I've had Lola's on my to-do list for many years and finally took the plunge. 

I came in on a Saturday right before the dinner rush and was able to be seated at the bar without a wait. The hostess was very pleasant to me and made me feel welcome even without a reservation. The restaurant filled up quickly afterwards so I was especially thankful. 

I started off with a cup of gumbo. I don't usually do appetizers but it was my first time eating Cajun cuisine in many years so I had to try theirs. I was torn between shrimp and beef for my sandwich so having some shrimp in the gumbo made it possible to satisfy both cravings. Satisfying is an understatement for this dish. Well done, 5/5 for sure. 

Ordered the roast beef debris po boy with all the dressings. I really liked the flavor combination. The crispness of the bread was perfect contrast for the soggy gravy. The meat portion left much to be desired unfortunately. Although I enjoyed the flavor profile I am disappointed that I left hungry. I wish I would have taken a picture so I could compare it to future visits. This was during dinner so I assumed it would be a good representation of their flagship product. Unfortunately, it was not. I will give it a second chance just in case it was an off day or a stingy cook. 2/5

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Place was whatever. Would I recommend to anyone? Meh probably not. Would I come here again? Mehhhh. Probably not. Got the crab cakes, had better. Got the wings and fries got 5 wings, just 5. They were okay. Looks like we bought fries with a side of wings. Crawpuppies, don't do it. Gumbo sad it was a 16 oz order probably a 6 oz. better off getting the cup you'll get more for your money. Shrimp and grits were good. And then the soft shell crab Po'boy. It was decent as well. All in all a mediocre dining experience. When we were sat we had to ask for our order to be taken by not our waiter/waitress. No even hello be right with you after we were sat. Food looks good though when you get it. $75 for two because we wanted to try and get a taste of a few things in. Probably not worth it."}
{"text":"Solid four stars. The Jambalaya was awesome, and one of the best parts was the chef makes his own hot sauce, and it was fantastic. My wife got a crab Po'Boy and loved it as well. We are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This is the place to chow down if you're in the mood for New Orleans food! The jambalaya was spicy and loved the andouille sausage and it complimented the shrimp and chicken. I also indulged in a platter of another NO staple, red beans & rice and of course, added the andouille sausage and it was good but not as tasty as the jambalaya. I started out with a cup of gumbo. I am definitely hooked on this place and had the pleasure of meeting Lola and the service was very good. Will definitely return on my next trip to Sin City and will check out the Catfish!"}
{"text":"I found this place after doing a Yelp search while shopping at the outlets in Vegas, and it was definitely a great find!  It's very unassuming from the outside, but the inside is bustling with customers.  The New Orleans decorations are fun without being over-the-top or tacky.  I ordered the shrimp po-boy.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and pretty big in size.  I would definitely come here again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!

Went in last night with about 10 people for my boyfriend's birthday. We all order a bunch of different things so we got to taste a little bit of everything. Everything was delicious.

My boyfriend ordered the oyster app, which was probably the most delicious oysters I have ever had. This says a lot because I'm from California so we used to go to the pier and have fresh seafood all the time.

I ordered the hot crab artichoke dip, also really good. The only down fall is not having enough break for it. The bread they give is omfg amazing. I think I ate a few pieces of the bread by itself (probably why I ran out for the dip).

For entree boyfriend ordered New Orlean's BBQ shrimp, I got the shrimp creole. My dish was so flavorful and so fresh and amazing, my only complaint was not having enough shrimp on there but it's not even a big deal because you can literally just eat the rice with the sauce and it's fantastic.

We got the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding and the Bananas Foster. Both are absolutely delicious. The Bananas Foster comes with vanilla ice cream which is much needed because those bananas are effing hot. The bread pudding was also amazing.

We ordered some beers and sweet tea which were also really good. 

For having such a big table of people, the restaurant was able to accommodate us inside comfortably. The service was great, could have been a bit nicer but it's not something you really care about because you're distracted with all of your friends to care. They get really really busy and for good reason. We were with someone who grew up in Louisiana and he also enjoyed all of the food.

We will definitely be back to explore the menu."}
{"text":"We have been to Lola's twice in the last week. I celebrated my birthday on the second visit. It was so good I had to come back. If you go you must try the shrimp and grits. Our favorite desert was the bananas foster bread pudding combo. So yummy."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came in before our show at the Smith Center last night but the food didn't live up to the hype. We started with a crab cake which was delicious but not thoroughly heated. It had salty chunks of crab and a tangy mayo on top that we enjoyed (even more so had it been warmer). I ordered jambalaya and my fiancé ordered the gumbo and I found myself wishing I had ordered the gumbo. The spice level in his dish was perfect and they brought garlic bread to sop up the excellent flavor. My jambalaya was fairly bland which I wasn't expecting at all! The dish was maybe 20 percent chicken and sausage and 80 percent rice. I added hot sauce just to give it some sort of kick and wished someone had talked me into ordering it with shrimp. We finished with Lola's famous bread pudding which was too rich for me but my fiancé loved it. Very dense but too much with the sauce, raisins and candied nuts, in my opinion. We also tried the banana pudding and that was probably my least favorite banana pudding I've ever had. Maybe because it was 7pm on a Friday and it was not the freshest? It was bland with a burnt marshmallow topping and very soggy nilla wafers. I did have some community coffee which was smooth and not bitter at all. I had two cups and a to go cup full as well. We might come back for more gumbo and maybe we'll try the crawpuppies and bananas foster instead."}
{"text":"Where do I begin-Last evening 10/3/13 a group of us had dinner at Lola's on Charleston Blvd here in Las Vegas.  My thanks go out to Lola, Hank and our server Lisa for giving me and us a wonderful dining experience.  This group I belong to randomly pick restaurants here in the valley that have good pricing, great environment and not chain restaurants each month.

When I walked in the door ONE HOUR EARLY, Hank welcomed me, I sat at the bar and had a cup of their delicious GUMBO.  Once my other dinner friends came, LISA explained in detail the favorites of the house.  The camaraderie of friends, great food and excellent service
will remain  in my mind as one of the best dining experiences Ive had here in LV since arriving 3 years ago from the BAY AREA.  at the end of the meal we took a group picture with LOLA.  

Once more I want to thank Hank, Lisa and Lola for such a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"My favorite place to visit in LV.  The bronzed shrimp and grits is superb as are the craw puppies.  My waistline doesn't need it, but the banana foster bread pudding is sinfully too amazing to pass up.  Skip the strip and head to Lola's."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh catfish, great service!  Make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Hearing about this place from many people that I work with, so I thought we would give it a go a little while ago. My husband and I love creole food! Suggestions were made to us to try the catfish and grits. Was delicious! I don't even like catfish!!! 

I personally ordered the gumbo and couldn't stop eating it! 

We have yet to try the banana bread pudding. Again, heard it was worth it. However just my luck they did not have it the night we went. :( 

The only things is the size of the restaurant being so tiny, it felt very cramped. Since it is so busy all the time, I almost felt a tiny bit rushed watching people in line waiting for tables.  That is probably just me though...my guilty conscious. 

Can't wait to go back and try more!! Wish their patio would take reservations though."}
{"text":"Came here after doing a google search of Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives for Las Vegas...  I've been craving cajun food, specifically jambalaya, so opted to try here.

A Small divey restaurant with the interior adorned with lots of New Orleans memorabilia--paintings, ornaments, New Orleans Saints items, etc...  Along with the dim lighting, put me back in time to a setting in Louisiana...

Service was fantastic.  The outgoing server helped me think aloud with my decision on what to order.  The pic of the crabcake looked interesting, but I didn't think I could finish it along with my entree.  I discussed their Po Boy which was featured on Triple D, but I had been craving good jambalaya for a long time.  Sooo ultimately, I went with jambalaya.

Big mistake.

The rice in the jambalaya was extremely mushy.  Killed the whole dish.  Obviously not freshly cooked and sitting in a huge pot of sauce for hours.  And where was the chicken and sausage?  Sparsely added... Why not 3 stars instead of 2?  Mushy riced jambalaya should never be served if you are charging people money to eat it...  Just my 2 cents..."}
{"text":"The dining experience has gone downhill. I ordered Cajun chicken which was nothing more than a cooked chicken breast with Cajun seasonings you could have grabbed from your own cupboard ~Very bland. Husband ordered the Jambalaya with like maybe 5 shrimp which was served in a dish small enough to be a side dish. Some of the chairs have black masking tape on them. If you're hungry you might think twice about coming to this overpriced place."}
{"text":"Get'em  in and Get'm out!

Another stop for my DDD list.  I am not sure why I keep falling for this.  Of course the food was,\"Killer!\", like everything Guy seems to eat. 
Well the crab cake, what we started with, was not \"Killer.\"  It was mushy, under seasoned, and tasted and had a texture more like paste in the inside than lump crab. 

I had the shrimp and grits and my friend had the blackened salmon, both totally edible, in fact they weren't bad.  I wish that the sauce on my grits was a little more viscous.  It began to get watery at the end.  My friend enjoyed the Salmon, but apparently it was slightly over seasoned in areas.  

My partners main complaint was that the portion size did not match the price.  For the price maybe the salad should come with the meal.  Also they're grits for crying out loud!  It's cheap hominy corn.  Put some more of them on the plate with the four shrimp.  It was an entree right?  \"How long does it take you to cook your grit?\"  Joe Pesci fans, Unite!

They had a special memorial day dessert, it was for the troops of course, so we tried it.  It was advertised to us as a cobbler, but it ended up being more of a shortcake type of dessert.  Never-the-less it was delicious and we gobbled it up.

The final downer was the being rushed, but we're not rushing you atmosphere.  I hadn't even got my full ass in the seat before the waitress was asking us what we wanted to drink.  How about bring us some water and a menu.  I almost stabbed a bus boy with my fork when he attempted to grab my plate before my last bite was gone.  Actually it was the last bite of my friends salmon, but jeeshhhhh, ASK!  I may have wanted to lick the plate, not really, but I like to keep my options open!
Plate Lickers Unite!"}
{"text":"Small, intimate place, decorated very cute , and staff was friendly. I will be coming back, because this place had some if the BEST blue crab cakes I've ever had. The texture was just right. They come over leafy greens, which was good but I didn't eat all the spinach..it was just a bit too much. Other then that that crab was amazing.  My friend got the Fettuccini Alfredo topped w grilled salmon, I tried this and that was also very, very good. Taste was just right. The sweet tea was bomb, especially in this heat.  I had like 5 glasses. If you're a Vegas local I would def recommend this place if you're looking for a different ambiance, and some good food."}
{"text":"I just have to say right away OMG!
OMG! OMG!

Ok now in full disclosure I love Cajun and Louisiana style food. As far as the food goes it is some of the best Cajun Ive had in a long time

We had the combo platter and it was mostly fried but lightly battered. The crab cake had great flavor and wasn't full of filler. The shrimp was great and you could tell they were fresh and never frozen. The collard greens werent great but acceptable. My GF said they weren't real collard greens and she wished she could find at least one place that served them right. (Any ideas let me know please)

I had the Blackened shrimp pasta. It was wonderful. I wish I had asked before ordering as I would have loved a piece of their catfish blackened like that and they do serve it like that so if you want blackened catfish I would give it a try.

The crawfish balls were good but had a little tangy flavor I couldnt place. I would try them again.

The decor is typical New Orleans style and it is small and almost cramped inside. I guess they call it intimate but I dont like having to listen to the conversations of those around you. 

The staff is very knowledgeable I ended up talking to our server after our meal and their lunch rush had left. She said you lucked out by being seated so quick. You should always call and make a reservation as they dont have ample seating.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"My fiancé came here 2 weeks ago while he was in Vegas and he can't stop talking about the fried shrimp po'boy, the blackened shrimp po'boy and the bananas foster. We'll be in Vegas next weekend, so I can't wait to try the food for myself. My family is from New Orleans, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Lola's hits the spot. I'll be back to update my review."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you need to know where it is. You can ride right past this place and not know what is there. It is a very small spot pretty much in the middle of nowhere. I felt like I wanted everything on the menu. For the place to be small it wasn't really a wait and the food comes fast. I can also say that the server was good. She was very attentive and kept checking on us. I ordered the Gumbo, Catfish, and shrimp and grits. The food was pretty good. The one thing that bothered me was the weird pricing. If you order the catfish dinner and want an extra piece of fish, the price doubles. That makes no damn sense at all. The shrimp and grits serving was small and overpriced. 

Overall I am not disapointed with the spot."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! Great place off the strip. A little hole in the wall, with a lot to offer..."}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!!!! 
The food is always out of this world! 
We arrived late and there was a big table of people being served so our service was kind of slow but she apologized about it and we just knew the food would make up for it and got were we right! We ordered the Char broiled oysters, blackened catfish, crab cakes with Red beans and rice and of course we were in heaven! 
Thank you for never giving us anything to complain about except being full! 
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Still a favorite. The customer service was excellent. All servers were attentive and assisted us when  we needed anything.  I definitely would recommend this place. Oh and the food is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"This place was worth this review. I had shrimp and gouda grits which was amazing. Whatever the sauce is was great. I also had the crab cake which was delicious as well. Our waiter was from new orleans and was very helpful and kind. Desert was amazing as well the banana foster was to die for. The banana pudding is great and you can't go wrong with a  brownie and ice cream"}
{"text":"Oh, my, what a wonderful dinner Thursday night here at Lola's!  We decided to go to Lola's at the downtown location because of its proximity to The Smith Center and the good Yelp reviews.  Everything was so good, I didn't even pause to take a picture!  My dining companion ordered chicken strips and fries with a side cup of red beans and rice.  He graciously allowed me a taste of each and everything was excellent!  I ordered the pecan crusted trout with Gouda grits and a side salad - absolutely superb!  The Gouda grits were a perfect accompaniment to the trout.  The pecans fell off the trout into the grits while eating it and added a lovely nice crunch. The Gouda grits come with several dishes and are a must try. In addition, Lola's absolutely knows how to cook fish properly. The side salad was ample and the house dressing spicy and fresh.  Lola's definitely is on my \"must return\" list to try other items on their menu.  But I will have to look away from the pecan crusted trout!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing...I had the Oyster Poboy with fries...if you go have the bread pudding...the staff were great. Ruth was our server she was engaging and well versed in the menu.."}
{"text":"Ordered a bronzed catfish poboy. Sandwich was good and the bread was soft, flaky, and fresh.  Just wished there was more than 1 catfish fillet in it."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot! For an appetizer we ordered the crab cake which came with lemony lettuce under it... That was amazing. For dinner I ordered the Blackened Shrimp & Grits... Wth... That was amazing! Then for dessert we had the bananas foster bread pudding... Omg that was amazing too! Super happy with this place. The service and food was superb! I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"On our first night in Vegas, after a long heavily trafficked drive, we decided to stay in and order take out. 

You have to know what to order here because it can be delicious, but it can also be blah. 

Bear ordered the shrimp over grits and it was mind blowing. MIND BLOWING!!! 

I ordered the jambalaya and it was yuck! YUHUCK!!! 


So think carefully before you order, ask them what their specialties are, what's popular on their menu, etc. 

An other thing I was extremely unhappy with, and I don't know if it's the same in the restaurant but, their take out portions are tiny. The pictures I'm about to share shows the food as it came before we started eating. Considering the amount of food, this place is heavily over priced!! 

I would go back for the shrimp and grits, but I would eat it there so I could demand more food lol"}
{"text":"This place is The Bomb!!! A Must for every visit to Vegas. I have recommended it to everyone I knew would be in Las Vegas & they have all agreed with my review. Try it, you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"Never having a po boy wasn't quite sure what to expect, of the sandwich or the restaurant. 

Was pleasantly surprised when walked into the restaurant. Looked very nice and well appointed with a theme from down south. The waitresses here I found to be top notch and very attentive. 

Had the po boy, or however it's spelled, that was featured on DDD and it has a very good flavor and the meat was tender. Maybe it was me but expected little more flavor.  Was GREAT for what I got, and the service.

It is a little on the pricey side so make sure to bring a little extra."}
{"text":"I've had Lola's on my radar for a while, but I've never been a huge fan of Cajun food. I decided to give in and come here for a post Christmas celebration with my OG.

We walked in and we were seated quickly. Everything looked pretty good but I decided on the bronzed shrimp and grits and my friend ordered the jambalaya with added shrimp.

My dish was great. The grits were nice and cheesy and the shrimp had a great kick. Very spicy. My friend enjoyed his dish quite a bit and said his was incredibly spicy too, in a positive way.

Service was attentive and friendly. Luckily they were very good about keeping the refills coming, it was definitely appreciated with the spice levels they serve."}
{"text":"I have tried the Jambalaya in almost every place in the city that I can order it...and this place is by far the best. Just the right amount of heat for my taste. The added strip was amazing just on it's own. Service is very good. It's a small dining area, so if you have a large party or are impatient, make a reservation."}
{"text":"So nice to get off the strip and try something different while visiting Las Vegas!  Stopped by for a late, light lunch on a Thursday.  The service was friendly and attentive.  Sitting outside was nice.  The gumbo was dandy as was the crab cake. Hubby loved the fries but I like them crispy-er so I had to hunt for the little crunchy ones.  Great flavor, though.  Bill for the foregoing with a VooDoo ale and 2 glasses of house chardonnay came to $35.  Don't know if I'd make a special trip to come here but it's certainly worth it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"It's my first trip to Lola's and surely won't be my last.  If the shrimp po' boy is any indication of the rest of the menu, this place will be soon a fave of mine.  The shrimp were about the size of prawns lightly battered set on a bed of shredded lettuce tomato and tartar sauce. Simple but it just tasted really good and fresh.  This will be a spot to watch some football thus season. I might convert to being a Saints fan, who dat!  Nah, hell no Go Niners!!! WE DAT!!!"}
{"text":"Just about one of the best meals in Las Vegas! Great service & food. Never had a bad experience. Nice to visit after the drive from Arizona! Can't wait to return for another awesome meal! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! Had 2 shrimp dinners that were perfect."}
{"text":"Incredible food!  Their Etoufee was so good, and their roast beef sandwich (as shown on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives) was out of this world.  The Gouda Grits were excellent (I'd never eaten grits before) and the oysters on the half shell were amazing (I'd never eaten those, either!).  Finally, the desserts...  The Bananas Foster Bread Pudding was just...  well...  I can't think of another superlative!  Oh, and the service?  Professional but very, very friendly.  The staff have great senses of humor!"}
{"text":"I don't know why it took us so long to finally get here.  I typically flock to any joint on Triple D but I guess I just don't make it near the Strip too often.  Came with my wife and baby, and although dinning area is small, we sat comfortably.  Staff was especially friendly and the owner walked around greeting tables. These are the things that impress my wife.  As for me, it's the food that really matters!  Lola's does Creole right and then some.  From hush puppies to soft shell crab to jambalaya, you can't go wrong.  I will point out that I've never lived in LA so my opinion is that of a Nawlins tourist.  But I know what my taste buds like, and they tell me I need to go back to Lola's again sometime soon!"}
