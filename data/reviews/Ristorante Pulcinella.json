{"text":"Pulcinella pizza is so good! My favourite pizza in Calgary by far.   The atmosphere is alright: bright with neat photos. But it's a little too loud for my taste and a bit too expensive to come to all the time. It's a lovely treat to order take out and have fancy pizza at home like regular pizza."}
{"text":"Whether it's lunch or dinner, Ristorante Pulcinella is a great place to go for something different. It's bright and clean inside, and the staff is very friendly and helpful.   Although the pizzas may seem somewhat expensive, it's really a good bargain given the quality of ingredients and uniqueness of the stretchy, thin crust pizza. The pizza oven holds four pizzas, so it might not be the fastest food in the world, but it's definitely worth the wait when spending time with friends.  The desserts are heavenly - definitely splurge on the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Great pizzeria, great wine and great decor.  Service was good but the children we went with didn't think that it was \"real\" pizza."}
{"text":"Basically it is overpriced for what you get. Paying about $17. for what they call a personal pizza which is mostly dough not a lot of topping. Service upstairs was poor, one waiter tried to handle the majority of the tables. We made a reservation (not needed) and when we asked to move to the patio to an empty table on two occasions, we were told they were reserved. Both were given to two groups of walk-ins (not cool). Waiter tried to up-sell on everything so check the menu."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 2 years. I try and stop in every couple months. You can't go wrong with the pizza and meatballs. I have had a couple Lukewarm dishes but all in all this is my favourite stop in Calgary for Italian food. I suggest the meatballs, calamari, Diavola pizza and tiramisu and a fresh Peroni beer on tap.  These are my favs and I will keep coming back for for years to come."}
{"text":"Ok, something has really changed at Pulcinellas. Makes me so sad.....they used to make my favourite pizza, the Diavola, but last night we ordered two of them and we were all so disappointed. What happened to the amazing sliced up spicy salami that used to be on it? It had completely different meat on it and it was just not the same! Then we also had a pizza that was supposed to have prosciutto on it (the reason we ordered it) and instead it had supermarket deli ham on it!? I tried to order the pizza with rapini on it.....they were out of rapini. Seriously, what is going on? Not my favourite pizza place any more......"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Pizza and apps are actually very good. Seems the service has gone downhill though.   Our server didn't even bring us a glass of water! I'm pretty sure it takes about 2 or 3 mins to cook their pizzas. We were there for 2 hours all together! Over an hour before we got an appetizer. We sat with no drinks. We couldn't get our bill when we wanted to go. Too bad. The food is good but lots of places have good pizza with better service!"}
{"text":"Ristorante Pulcinella was at the top of my \"to try\" pizza list.  I had heard that they used ovens from Italy and are one of the only Associazione Pizzaioli Napolitani pizzarias in the world.  Impressed by this knowledge, I was expecting to be totally wowed.   I wasn't.  The decor is really nice - I liked everything about the set-up.  That was a plus.  The pizza itself though, well....it's expensive, as expected.  And I just didn't enjoy it very much.  I found the crust totally soggy, to the point of tasting undercooked.  It was burnt around the edges.  There was not a lot of flavour.  The 2 people I was with said they liked it, but I did too.  I think we were all embellishing because we were supposed to like such an authentic pizza.   I'd recommend it to try out for sure because pizza is totally a \"to each his own\" kind of thing.  For me, this one doesn't belong on \"my own\" list."}
{"text":"My Princess Bride loves this bastion of Kensington dining. It is true Italian design with its modern lines and  urban elegance. The wood burning oven is the centerpiece of the whole operation. Cranking out Napolitano style pizza that is moist and fresh with its ingredients, it soothes your palate. You have to be cognisant of the style of pizza that Neapolitans serve, it is not the accustomed and usual pizza fare of the masses. Their other non pizza dishes are nice as well, Princess B just loves the Arancini. Prices are quite high, considering portion size, but what do you expect? Like the famous prancing horse automaker of Maranello, you're paying for Italian design sensibilities."}
{"text":"To me, if the chefs at Pulcinella are using canned mushrooms... whatever! They still make one of the best pizzas available in Calgary.   Pulcinella takes the bastardized North American \"pizza\" and tears it to pieces. Extremely palatable and simple in presentation. No pools of grease bubbling up (and eventually solidifying) on these pizzas.   I love the decor at Pulcinella... it's very polished, yet comfortable. The staff is usually friendly and helpful. Most of the appetizers I would just skip, and just go right in for the pizza. It's pricey here, but worth it for an indulgence of the traditional."}
{"text":"So the pizza was good and the service was decent. We only sat around once waiting for water refills...  But my main complaint:  if you're going to make us cut our own pizza, we need to be given non ceramic surfaces to it on. I know I'm overly sensitive on this one, but I also know I can't be alone in this!  The horrible feeling that a knife that hits directly on a ceramic plate - or whatever your plates are made of....  Maybe if we were given rotary cutters it wouldn't have been so difficult.   Having to cut my own pizza on a scratchy surface ruined my entire dinner experience. I'm glad I had good friends with me to make up for it!!"}
{"text":"I seen this place on TV and I got to say it is way over rated. Went in and it was dead, service was terribly slow. The pizza was alright, but nothing spectacular. I also added a few things to the pizza I chose so it wasnt even their concoction. Had my pizza not come with my tweeking it would have been terrible. I enjoyed the appetizer though,  that's about the only thing that was delicious. I also noticed a table of people come in after us and we're served their food before, they were very chatty with the manager and their body language suggested they either frequent there alot or are friends. I don't like being treated like a 2nd class customer because I'm  not buddy buddy with you. There wasn't very many people and I wasn't impressed with being served after your friends who had a larger party of people than the 2 of us.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic! Walking around in Kensington with some friends, we stumbled across Pulcinella. The place was extremely busy, so we ended up sitting at the bar. It was well worth it, however. The wine selection and fresh-made pizzas were perfect!  Pulcinella has a very classy and modern vibe to it. The staff were friendly and prompt with getting drinks. The service was average, which is pretty good considering that the place was packed.   I definitely recommend Pulcinella if you are in the Kensington area. It's a great place to catch up with friends, go on a date, or have a night out with the fam."}
{"text":"Great food, had the gnocchi which was super yummy.  The pizzas were good too! They could not accommodate  fancier shooters so it's not a place to drink but overall, it's an awesome place."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner, and agree with the people below about the service being better during lunch as it's not as busy.  The times I've been there for dinner the wait staff definitely seemed a bit overwhelmed.  I liked the pizzas, but they were not the best I've had.  I liked the mushroom appetizer here, and the service in general was fine.  I'd go there again, but it's not my favorite restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this restaurant, it took the person at the front 10 minutes to seat us (she was talking to customers and the place was dead) When she finally seated us, it took another almost 10 minutes before we got our coffees, to which she forgot all the cream/sugar, and we couldnt find anyone else to help us, so we walked out! Second time I visited, the service was better, but the food, which is touted as real Naples style pizza, didnt live up to its reputation. Our pizza was almost undercooked and although I know they arent supposed to be over whelmed by ingredients on the pizza, it would have been nice to at least have more than a couple slices of this and that thrown about, for the expensive price."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. I'm obsessed with their tartufo pizza - it's the only thing I ever order so I can't really say much about their other food. But desert is also great, I like the saltinbocca the best. Its a great atmosphere and I love going there for birthdays or even just a normal date night. I recommend it to everyone and have never gotten negative feedback. Prompt service and great food, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Calgary for traditional Italian thin-crust pizza. Apparently the owner/chef got training in Naples prior to opening this pizza place and is a member of the Associazione Pizzaioli Napolitani.  The decor is very contemporary and chic. The pizzas are thin and crisp. I would suggest picking pizzas without soggy ingredients such as artichokes as that will cause the pizza to be a bit soggy when no drained properly. I learned that the hard way.... I prefer sticking to the basics such as prosciutto and mushrooms.  The tiramisu that I had for dessert very good, one of the better ones that I've had. It was very creamy and you can actually taste the liqueur."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my good friend's 24 birthday. Luckily my friends and I always have a good time together because this restaurant experience was horrible. From start to finish everything was just bad. The service was terrifyingly bad. Our waiter was slow and un-attentive, and not to mention looked like he was the most depressed man in the world. He made poor excuses as to why our food came out at weird times and even spoiled by friends surprise birthday cake by asking when to bring it out (despite our earlier arrangements).   And then there was the food. Way over priced and bland. I ordered a starter salad which was a bowl full of pre-packaged lettuce and exactly two cherry tomatoes. No other vegetables in sight. I also ordered the calamari which was freezer burnt, overcooked, and caked in bland tomato sauce covered in lemon juice. Extremely un-appetizing to say the least. I tasted all my friend's pasta and pizza only to be further disappointed. The pasted was also flavourless and the pizza crust was soggy.   We spoke with the manager after paying 18% gratuity for our large group (a tip we did not think fit the service whatsoever) and he seemed apologetic and informed us the waiter in question was leaving. Needless to say, it is such a shame Pulcinella cannot deliver delicious food and great customer service because the restaurant itself is in a great location and has gorgeous decor.  I won't be coming back here and I recommend you avoid it,too."}
{"text":"Very tasty pasta, lovely salad -generous portions. Excellent value for money. Good service as well.   Only complaint is no soft surfaces means restaurant is noisy. Still, highly recommended."}
{"text":"The best Napolitana Pizza in calgary. i'm not a big fan of meat on my pizza, and this place definitely has great vegetarian selections. Their  Margarethia and veggies Pizzas are delicious. Parking is scarce sometimes around Kensington but the location is great. Everything but the Pizzas is average at best so do come here for the Pizza, pare it with some good wine and make sure sure you have reservations for busy times. The atmopshere is nice and the service is good."}
{"text":"amazing pizza!!!!! authentic and delicious. we've been talking about it for a month now"}
{"text":"I have been there twice.  I have been living in north america for about 10 years, and this is indeed the closest to Italian pizza I have experienced on this continent (I am from Italy).  The pizza is supposed to have a few burning marks, be fairly thin, a thin layer of tomato sauce and hand shredded mozzarella. Toppings are supposed to be sparse compared to American counterparts. They got their bases covered.    Having said that, I don't think the pizzaioli there are experienced enough and some of the ingredients are so so. The mozzarella is fresh, but should melt a little more. The quattro stagioni had a ham that wasn't that fresh (and yes, in Italy it is usually served with the topping devided into quarters).  The mushrooms were ok (yes they are supposed to be pickled).  The dough was good but I expected a little more flavors given the Canada has much better flours than Italy; perhaps it should have risen slower.    Back to the pizza in Italy, there really are about 4 maintypes: pizzette and pizza al trancio are those you usually eat on the fly; pizza napoletana is what  Pulcinella is serving: the dough is gummier and somewhat thicker.  Finally, the pizza you are likely to eat elsewhere in Italy is a variation of the pizza napoletana: thinner and crispier.   I would caution people from ordering pizza ai quattro formaggi, since it is next to impossible to find the right type of cheeses needed (sone are very fresh and hardly exported and there are no equivalents in Canada, forcing them to use cheeses that are not suitable to melt on a pizza).  As an appetizer I tried the mixed bruschetta which I did not go crazy for.  The bruschetta was cold and overloaded with tomatoes and other spices.  A shame given they have a wood burning oven and would take no time to prepare on the fly. Nothing Italian in it...  The atmosphere is nice, fresh and modern, but hardly Italian.  Overall I would definitely go back. The pizza is pretty good. Nonetheless,not everyone may like it especially folks accustomed to pizza here and expecting to be served that."}
{"text":"Good classic pizza base, with a non-watery tomato sauce and enough cheese (common Neapolitan pitfalls). But be warned that some topping combos work better than others. In particular I am a sucker for the ones with arugula on top. A bit pricier than some Neapolitan style spots in town, but with more non-pizza options than most. My tablemates really enjoyed their pastas.   Excellent service (friendly, efficient, non-intrusive) every time I've been. Recently renovated (like, last week), the restaurant is huge now that they have taken over the upstairs ex-restaurant space as special event and weekend overflow seating. This should relieve some of the wait-reward star penalty assigned by my fellow esteemed Yelpers."}
{"text":"I seem to be 'swimming against the current' here, but here's my two cents.  - I do not fancy soggy pizza. Maybe it was the EXTRA liquids from the canned mushrooms and artichokes the chef did not account for. YUK    - I expected to find a little more than a single basil leaf  chopped and diligently distributed over the an entire pizza - especially for a pizza where 'fresh basil' is one of its main ingredients.  - To end in a somewhat positive note, the pizza crust was good (I do make my own pizza dough at home so good means good, it would have been great if it wasn't soggy and burnt)   Overall, I was NOT impressed. The pizza we had reminded me nothing of the authentic- simple- fresh - thin- crusted pizza we had in Italy."}
{"text":"Favourite place for authentic thin crust pizza, good Italian wine selection and coffee, great desserts, have to try the affegotto and saltinbocca. Pasta dishes are great as well."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced in Canada. We got there pretty late on a Friday night, so they weren't busy. We got seated immediately and the waitress came over, looking unimpressed, and dropped two menus on our table. No water was offered to us. We had to flag her down 10 minutes later to put our orders in, yet no water to be seen. We ordered a margherita pizza (upgraded to burrata cheese), mussels and caprese to share. Our food came out suspiciously fast - makes you wonder. At that point we finally asked for some water and proceeded to have food.   The mussels : probably the tiniest mussels I have ever seen and a relatively small serving size. Really?!  Caprese: the cheese tasted nothing like burrata. For reference sake, burrata means buttery in Italian. Well theirs tasted rubbery. And boy was it salty!!!!   Margherita: the pie was over cooked and overly dry, it tasted like it has been sitting under the lamp for hours. Burrata had the same rubbery taste and the rate sauce tasted cheap.  As we were choking on that dry pizza dough and rubbery burrata, there was only one thing we were hoping would save the day - a damn glass of water !!!!! Nope, no such luck, we never got our water. Never."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of four on a Sunday evening looking for a quick meal before a film at the Plaza Theatre - business was looking strong, ranging from couples to families. We were seated quickly and received excellent, attentive service. They didn't even balk at accommodating my lactose-intolerant companions.  The decor is modern and cheery, which complements the food. You can choose to sit by the bright windows for people-watching or further inside, closer to the wood-burning pizza oven. We started with the bruschetta, which were tasty with flavourful tomatoes and red bell peppers with dried ricotta on small cuts of thin bread. I shared the cotto (ham) pizza while my companions had the vegetali grigliati (grilled vegetable) pizza.  I agree with previous reviews that the pizzas are a bit soft in the middle, but not unreasonably so, and for the ingredients and the tasty crust, I would take this a million times over other conventional North American pizza. Like my friend said, \"You don't feel gross after eating it.\"  $65 for four people with drinks, no dessert. I'd say that prices are on par with other casual dining in the Kensington area. Great service. I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this while sitting in Pulcinella because even though I'm done my meal, my friend isn't. My pizza was fine, but hers was pretty burnt on the underside. She complained and instead of a refund, or discount, or even an APOLOGY, she was told she could send it back to the kitchen 'but it might take some time.' The waiter wasn't wrong. I was done eating about 2 minutes after her pizza came (mine was fine, good even, and I didn't want to let it get cold while we waited for a new pizza to be sent out to her.) The waiter saw this, still no apology.   I'm really not a picky person, food wise. Denny's is like my favourite restaurant. But Denny's would still apologize if they burnt the shit out of your food!  UPDATE: waiter just came over and apologized and took the pizza off the bill and gave us shots that, while terrible, were a sweet gesture. Think someone read my review but still nice. Changing my star rating.  UPDATE UPDATE: changed the star rating back to 2. The waiter came over so we could pay our bill. First he asks how the free booze was. We responded, 'Erm...what was it?' Turns out it was some obscure moonshine thing that he described as being similar to 'bad tequila.' On the one hand I was offended he'd give us bad tequila as an apology drink, but on the other hand it makes sense if he read in my Yelp review that my fav restaurant is Denny's. Also, it gave me a pretty solid buzz. But then we paid out bills, and that's when things really went downhill again. I tipped a normal amount but my friend, a nicer human than I, was impressed he took her pizza off her bill and put down a 20$ for her 12$ bill.   Now maybe I'm just cheap, but a 50% tip is pretty damn nice. Was I the waiter, I would've said 'do you want some change?' Or at the very least, 'THANK YOU!' (Although that would be presumptuous unto itself.) instead, buddy just runs away with her 20$. No further comment. Like, pretty sure you only apologized in the first place because of my Yelp review, so let's not get all high and mighty.  Anyways, good on you if you've read this whole post. If you didn't, the moral of the story is the customer service at pulcinella wasn't phenomenal."}
{"text":"I used to live in Italy and while I was there I went to Naples and the Campania region a few times, so pizza is close to my heart.  Pulcinella is the closest I've had to authentic Neopolitan pizza (a la da Michele or Trianon) outside of Italy.  I am hooked on the Pulcinella (margarita with buffalo mozzarella) but they were out of buffalo mozzarella on a recent visit so I tried a grilled vegetable one that was fairly good.  On my last visit I ended my meal with their tiramisu, and it was absolutely decadent.  Pizzas average about $17 (yes, pricey) and other menu items (appetizers, desserts, drinks) are also slightly more expensive than the norm.  However, I know where I'll be celebrating if Italy wins the World Cup!"}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place. I honestly think its the best pizza in town.. the Diavola is the pizza I tried last and I thought it was unreal!   Ive always sat at the bar and had a great time! The bartenders double as great servers and I like that they have Innis & Gunn on tap! Great wine selection as well!  I have read a lot of mixed reviews on this place but I assure you - the food is great!! Im not always one for eating the crusts on my pizza but OMG this place has the best pizza dough eevveerrr!   very easy online reservation system as well!   p.s. those aren't mints at the reception area - they are black licorice candies (so if you love black licorice like me, go for those!)"}
{"text":"Awful pizza. I've been twice and will not return."}
{"text":"Once again,Ristorante Pulcinella has met and exceeded our expectations! We tried the parmesan tempura appetizer and it was delicious. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and the wine. Five stars!"}
{"text":"I am Italian and I am from Montreal where there is a huge Italian community. When I moved to Calgary, I was disappointed in the Italian restaurants and gave up hope that I would find a good one. Then I tried Pulcinella! AMAZING pizza! They actually use a wood burning oven. The Italian way! The gnoccis are just perfect. If I have out of town guests, I bring them here so that they can realize that Calgary does have some hidden gems."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I tipped so little!!  I went here with my girlfriend and her 2 friends because we remembered good things when we lived in Kensington a few years back.  Things have apparently changed.    The restaurant only had 5 or 6 small tables on the main floor and we ordered our pizzas quickly.  We then waited 1 hour and 40 minutes for our 3 pizzas....we watched a pile of pizzas go out, so we asked where they were all going after about 40 min.  Waiter said that they had a 20 person party upstairs and they wanted to finish their order first....ummm ok....even tho we ordered before them?...yup...he then told us it would only be another 5 min....for the next 45 minutes straight.  Hate it when they do that...I'd rather be told the truth.    When the pizzas finally came they looked thrown together and rushed...I know that thin crust pizza should be light on the toppings but come on....a few morsels of meat and 3 blobs of cheese the size of a toonie....for about $20!!! Probably my last trip unless someone insists."}
{"text":"The toppings were fresh and tasty, but the crust tasted like we were eating the cardboard box. The toppings were clumped off to one side, like they had been dumped on, rather than distributed around the pizza. Undercooked, damp, limp crust. They were not cut, so slicing through the damp, limp crust just ripped them rather than cut them. $45 for 2 GF pizzas that were like wet cardboard."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, its actually a shame given the ingredients are of good quality, but the dough is soggy, the pizza comes out warm but the bottom of the \"crust\" is black with soot.   We had to leave and go eat elsewhere, thats how bad it was."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner. It was really loud but that's a sign of a great place to eat. Me and my wife tried 7 different menu items and each one was excellent. The waiter was a little distracted cuz it was busy but he was a great guy."}
{"text":"The service is good, the surroundings are nice, but I came for gourmet pizza and was seriously disappointed Pizza crust is not supposed to taste like a book of matches or cigarette ashes in my mouth I think eating a frozen pizza from the supermarket is a better option in this case."}
{"text":"One star because you had 'canned mushrooms'??  Jr T, get over yourself...   Pulcinella's one of the handful of places in Calgary that you can get something other than 'standard' North American pizza (read: not swimming in greese, glorified Pizza Hut).    'Soggy in the middle'??  Sorry... maybe this was an 'off' day but I've never seen that at Pulcinella...  of course, being what it is, it's certainly not  meant to be picked up in slices...   What do you get?  Well besides the tasty crust and the great sauce... wood burning oven... you get real Italian cheese and meats...in a (perhaps a bit overly done) cosmopolitan setting with decent service... try the Prosciutto and  fresh arugula or their spicy Diavola.  (apparently you should stay way from the mushroom and artichoke... but then, who wouldn't)  Pulcinella is simply 'Best in Class'  - even if I think the Napoletana certification is a bit hokey."}
{"text":"Pulcinella can be summed up in a word, disappointing.   The best thing about the restaurant is the interior design and ambiance. Bright and white like a high end restaurant in Italy.   The service was good but the pizza wasn't anything special. The server gave us a spiel about the imported wood burning oven: 1000 degrees hot, the dough cooks in 90 seconds and the black spots are not burnt crust but intentionally cooked that way to provide flavor.   Burnt crust is burnt crust. There's a big difference between carmellized and carbonized. One adds depth of flavor the other tastes awful.   You know what I say? Turn down your oven, then the pizza won't burn. I can live with waiting longer than 90s for my 'za.   Besides the charred crust, there was no real flavor. Everything was salty.  I understand that this style of pizza is easy on the toppings but they should at least be equally spread over the entire pizza. If you order the tartufo, truffled pizza, everyone wants to get some truffles.   I don't recommended Pulcinella and won't be back."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the food here..it is unique with simple flavours and ingredients. The décor and ambiance is nice and seems to adapt with the company you are with (ie it would work for a date or a group of co-workers just as well). The servers are good too. I've been a few times now with larger groups (8-10 people) and everything has been well received.  I was there today again (3rd time) and my only complaint was the manger. He stormed around the dining room, clearly unhappy with several elements of his employees performances (which weren't terrible from what I could see and no one was complaining). He was repeatedly barking orders to the guy behind the bar, the hostess and the servers well within earshot of customers. It was a little embarrassing to watch. I have enough restaurant experience to be able to say \"dude...take it outside or in the back or better yet leave it till later in the shift\" because all he seemed to be doing is making the staff anxious and the guest who could hear unsettled.  When we left he was outside on his phone and he barked an unfriendly \"thank you\" to us. Lighten up.  I wont let that influence my decision to go back again but if I do and I see the same thing...it might eventually make me feel comfortable elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went for a Calzone. It was $20. Meat was salty. It had a different taste. I think I prefer the Pizza Hut Calzone....this place has a nice atmosphere but they should drop their prices by 30%"}
{"text":"I keep on going back to this restaurant as much as I can it is the real authentic Neapolitan style pizza it is definitely the best in western Canada if you're looking for that type of pizza"}
{"text":"Pulcinella is one of those restaurants that invites you to say it's name with an Italian accent.   Lively and fun, Pulcinella is an excellent Italian restaurant that serves simple, fresh food in a straightforward way (regardless of all the dinner guests inspired to speak in Italian accents).  Every time I have come here I have left full, satisfied and happy with the service.  Notable menu options are the risotto balls, any of the pizza's on the menu (including, and especially, the dessert pizza's) and the caprese salad. Be forewarned that the portion sizes are more mama's kitchen than fancy restaurant, so don't let your eyes do the ordering, you can always get more!  Head to Pulcinella's and enjoy a lively atmosphere full of clanking wine glasses and laughter over good, simple food.  T."}
{"text":"We really love Pulicinella! It's really a treat to have this restaurant in kensi, it's likely the best pizza in the neighbourhood.  As Rebbeca C. mentioned, it can be loud here, but we've been lucky with coming at less busy times and by sitting upstairs, which seems a bit less noisy.   If you are looking for thin crust, artisanal pizza in Kensington, look no further than Pulcinella. They offer both red and white sauce pizza, and you will likely be pleased no matter which you order.   We have had a few pizzas off the menu and the crust is always outstanding. They update their menu regularly and the severs are great for guiding you in what to choose. For appetizers we've tried both the calamari and arancini, both were so good!  I'd recommend this place in the summer, for wine and pizza on the second floor patio."}
{"text":"This is a terrific place.  I have been here a number of times. Yesterday, we sat on the 2nd floor deck for dinner.  It was fabulous.  The service is always first rate.  Last night we asked for a family style pasta and meatballs, which is not even on the menu.  Guess what?  They brought it and it was fabulous.  No issue - just service and a quality product.  The appetizers were also quite good.  The pizza here is amazing.  With wine and beer it was about $75 a couple and we actually had more than we could eat.    You owe it to yourself...."}
{"text":"Can't say that I'm a fan of many of the Calgary-style deep dish pizza's that I've come across since moving to Calgary, but I was pleasantly surprised to come across Ristorante Pulcinella last week.  I get the impression that it can get quite busy here, but was fortunate enough to come on a slow night, so seating and quick service wasn't a problem. Shared an order of the antipasto, which was quite tasty and a great starter to share for four people.  Also shared an order of the Diavolo pizza, which was delicious. The Neapolitan-style crust was beautiful. One of the best I've had outside of Pizza Libretto in Toronto. Great pizza if you can handle the kick from the spicy salami.  Overall, a great experience here. I would definitely come back to sample the rest of the menu.   My only criticism would be that the pizzas could use a bit more diversity. Too many of the pizzas feature prosciutto - which I'm a big fan of, but I would prefer more options with the pizza menu.  Also, the Tiramisu was out of this world!"}
{"text":"So after having Brazilian the night before, we wanted to just chill and have something simple.  My gf and I scoped out Kensington earlier in the day and found this was the spot to head to.    So it wasn't that packed.  The ambiance of this place reminded me of a place you would find on College Street. We were greeted by our cheery hostess and seated right away.   The waitress then proceeded to explain to us the experience and what the pizzas are prepped.  I didn't want to cut her off and say \"WE KNOW.\"  I let her finish and then I said, my gf is Italian.  She's like, ok I'll shut up now.  LOL.    So I ordered the quattro stagione pizza.  Of course I'm not too much of a fan of doughy pizza to start. even though the experience of a wood burning over pizza can't be beat.  Second of all the design of the quattro stagione made me laugh.  All the toppings were separated in each quarter.  I thought that to be kind of corny.  Dunno if I'd order that again.    I still like the place, I'd go back though just for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pulcinella is a solid showing for Neapolitan style pizza in Calgary. Yes the have the proper oven, yes they have fresh ingredients, yes the have the Associazione Pizzaioli Napolitani certification, and yes they have a wonderful selection of wines to compliment. Big checkmarks for all areas.  But for the love of San Pietro, why do they deliver these marvelous creations to the tables on china plates? The heat from the pizza is trapped and becomes soggy instead of staying crispy and chewy.   I will go back to Pulcinella, it is a marvelous place, but I will ask that they plate my pizza either on paper, or a wood cutting board."}
{"text":"In terms of service, ambiance and location, Pulcinella would get 5 stars hands down.   In terms of the quality of pizza however, Pulcinella gets two stars in my books.   I\"ve had A LOT of pizza in my day and age and when I was told that Pulcinella served the BEST pizza in town, I was ready to be blown away. I was blown away all right, but for all the wrong reasons.   My pizza was soggy, totally flat, and burnt in certain places. It was AWFUL. I'd much rather have the $6 Ristorante pizzas that I can pick up at the supermarket. What's worse is that I had taken a couple of friends from Chi-Town and they were both completely disappointed in Pulcinella.   My visit to Pulcinella was completely humiliating and disappointing. There is NO chance I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Trying to decide if this is my favorite pizza in Calgary - or Una, it's a close call.  I will say the crust and the sauce said it all upon our first visit. We talk daily about going back to try more on the menu, but our first time through we loved the Heirloom Tomato Salad, and pizza. It's a fantastic meal, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Our group of 6 went and had a great time last night. Wouldn't have mattered where we went, it would have been great regardless. For our reservation we got seated upstairs, which is too bad since the air conditioning was on too high and we were all cold after a few minutes. We were hoping to sit down stairs since it was so much more warmer! After all it is October and cooler at night, so having air conditioning on is un-necessary for dinner.  We ordered allot of different food and drink so we can all try a bit of everything.  All of our food was great except for two items. We ordered some bruschetta and the bread came out burnt and tough to eat. Ouch! They loaded it up with lots of tomatoes, maybe to make up for it being burnt or so we wouldn't notice? We just ended up eating all the toppings and leaving the bread. The 2nd item that wasn't very good was the Caprese salad. It was so salty which it shouldn't be since the salad only has three ingredients (tomatoes, mozzarella and balsamic vinegar) we noticed it had rock salt on top and allot of it which didn't make it edible or taste great, so we just left it. Ew! We didn't mention anything to our waiter, nor did he ask why we didn't eat the salad or the bruschetta bread. We just let it be since we knew we had other food coming soon and was hoping for something warm and yummy to eat.  Besides those two items, we did order 3 different pizza's to sample, some pasta and calamari to  share as well. All were very good. We all drank wine and they have a pretty good selection of wine.  It would be great to see some more pizza varieties since all ethier had pork or a couple vegetarian options. Maybe something with chicken or beef for variety?  We had a great time and most of the food was pretty good. The place is decorated very well and is nice and modern. Our waiter was okay, but definitely not friendly. The girls at the front to seat you were so nice and made you feel welcome.  Over-all just a couple minor things with the food, but besides that things were good."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for lunch. It has a fantastic atmosphere and decor.  I went for lunch with a friend and the service was fantastic! The server was attentive and helpful.  I totally recommend sharing the capriccosa (sp?) pizza with a friend along with a starter salad. Absolutely delicious!  I have seen children in the restaurant before, but today there was a group of 3 little kids and two moms. The kids were watching them make pizza's and then the chef gave each of them a little piece of dough to play with while they waited for their meals. The kids had a great time and the mom's could have a good visit!   Great to see everyone enjoying lunch so much. The manager came to our table to make sure we had everything we needed.  The latte's also come with a little biscotti - perfect way to end the meal!"}
{"text":"I was expecting great things. I really wanted to like Pulcinella because I like thin-crust pizzas, and it looks like a nice joint too from the outside. Not to mention its great location.  To start off, I had a slightly difficult time picking the pizza I wanted to order. It seemed I could either have a veggie pizza, or one with ham/salami/bacon/prosciutto. I don't eat pig by-products. So I settled for a Margherita (tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil).   It was just okay. The crust was alright, and agreeing with some of the other reviewers, the center was really soggy. Who likes tomato sauce on soggy dough? Not me. I like my crust to at least hold up when I cut it with my fork and knife. This was a bit of a mess. My friend said that today was not even that bad, and sometimes the center was WAY soggier. But she said she loves this place regardless. Anyway, the tomato sauce on the pizza was quite flavourful.   Overall, I was expecting more. A lot more I guess. The pizza was nothing to write home about. It was just okay, and just okay is not enough. I would probably not go again, and would try the other Napoletana Pizza place in this city."}
{"text":"Yikes! This has got to be my worst review yet for any restaurant in the city. I had high expectations based on previous reviews. We came for a girls' night out, so at least the company was lovely.   Our server had a mediocre understanding of the menu, and had an overly casual (bordering on creepy) attitude with our group. And... it was... so slow... At least the food was great, right? At nearly $50 per girl (one entree and a glass of wine each, plus shared calamari), we really ought to have stayed in instead. The gnocchi was bland and overcooked, the calamari slimy. Not fun."}
{"text":"They have a new street menu that is just ideal for a weekday lunch. Portions are good and the prices are reasonable for an Italian restaurant in the area"}
{"text":"Tried this restuarant recently on a food crawl through Kensington so granted the meal I had was mass-prepared in advance. Anyway, the arancini taste somewhat chemical, I couldn't stomach more than a bite. The bruschetta was ok, but served on pizza crust I think. The pizza was average - I like the crust, but the toppings didn't stand out to me. One thing was great - the wine!"}
{"text":"Great location, great ambiance, good food and fair prices.  Definitely worth a try, located in the heart of Kensington, with a modern hip vibe and definitely unique cuisine.  I would rate it higher if the food  quality and quantity reflected the prices a bit closer.  There is only so much you can charge for pizzi before you have to say \"its only pizza\"."}
{"text":"I had seen reviews on this restaurant and had to try their pizza. We went for a late lunch. Hostess was great, seated us at table 11, our lucky number. Off to a great start. Service was OK, really slow though, nothing outstanding to report there. The pizza was good but was cooler than room temperature when we got it, I wish we could have tried it nice and hot. The ingredients (mushrooms, black olives, artichokes) seemed fresh enough and I liked the crust, done real Italian style in the wood fired oven. It was soggy in the middle, kind of a let down but we did not say anything. They have to know by now, judging from all the reviews on this crust. Are they not heating the oven hot enough or what? I had a couple of glasses of really amazing white wine. $9.50 a glass. Prices were standard for decent Italian food. Decor of the restaurant was alright. It is larger than it looks from the outside. Would return if others suggested it., I won't rush back by any means if possible as there are many other good places to try for pizza in Calgary."}
{"text":"Burnt pizza, slow service and when asked if I liked the food I mentioned I did not, I did not request any discounts etc but was still met with a defensive rebuttal about \"the style of pizza\". Gross and pretentious and not going back!"}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Overall experience: 3/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  I've been to Pulcinella a few times and had an 'OK' time. In terms of being the best restaurant to go to for Italian pizza, I recommend to NOT come here (hence the Yelp's 2/5). The taste, quality, and cost of the pizzas are not worth it.   The restaurant's décor is very modern and \"fresh\". It has a nostalgic feel to it with large photos of Italy and people making pizzas hanging on the walls. They even have a brand new Vespa located in the middle of the room! The focal point however is their large wood burning oven where you can see chefs roll out fresh lumps of dough and then sticking it in the oven to bake.  I visited Pulcinella a few years ago on the weekend for dinner which was extremely loud and busy - pizzas were backed up so food came out slowly and the quality was horrendous. My recent visits were during lunch on a weekend so the food came out in a reasonable amount of time and the servers were friendly and attentive.     Pulcinella's serves authentic Napolenta pizzas for ~$15-$20 each and can go up to $20-$30 depending what you get. They are about the size of a medium pizza, and come with or without tomato sauce. They also serve some tasty traditional Italian appetizers (~$15) such as calamari and bruschetta.  I highly recommend the 'Antipasto Misto' ($27) which is perfect for sharing between 4-5 people. It consists of assorted pickled and roasted vegetables (sautéed caramelized onions, sundried tomatoes, artichokes, eggplant), peppers stuffed with cheese and meat, black and green olives, prosciutto, and mozzarella. It's a little pricey but the quality and variety of ingredients is terrific especially if you eat it with the freshly baked bread provided. You may have to order more bread, but I guarantee you will be pretty full.  I tried most of their tomato sauce pizzas which has a base of mozzarella, parmigiano, and basil with additional toppings such prosciutto, mushrooms, salami, or artichokes. If you love cheese though, I recommend the 'Quattro Formaggi' ($19) which has mozzarella, gorgonzola, parmigiano, emmental and basil. Full of flavor and cheesy goodness!  Overall, the pizzas were only okay...the crust always comes out limp and gradually gets soggy towards the middle (it was not crispy at all). There weren't enough toppings and sometimes it was overwhelming salty. The biggest turn off though is the burnt areas around the crust so you get that nasty bitter taste."}
{"text":"Had been in here a few times before. I must say things appear to be going downhill. The service is struggling. We ordered two appetizers. They brought two appetizers but only one was correct. We ordered two pizzas and again only one came out correctly and by the time the new one came out mine was already gone. The waiters were constantly yelling across the room at each other making it very loud. We were sitting in the bar area. They did not have a table for a couple that sat next to us despite them making a reservation and did nothing but offer them a free appetizer for the inconvenience while all the while never once accepted responsibility but merely said it just got too busy. The food is good, however, it too has lost some of its goodness. While sitting in the bar area we got the impression they were simply trying to rush us out the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"Easily the best, most authentic pizza in the entire city! Every time I go there to eat I have had excellent service - the staff really know the menu and the food. The only cons are that it can get loud and quite warm during the peak hours, but in a away it almost adds to the experience. I always feel like I am part of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's pricey for pizza they have to explain and justify to you why it tastes the way it does.  There I said what justifies a three star review. We stumbled into here after an insane hour of lining up for Salsa that felt like a scene out of Olive Twist (just you wait for my review Salsa Fest...*squints*) and we were quite hungry. I've always walked by Pulcinella and never had the opportunity or interest to try it.  The service was quite attentive and I do like the look of the place. Before ordering, our waitress explained to us what Pulcinella's way of cooking pizza was, but she didn't' seem to SELL it. It sounded like she was trying to justify the burnt taste and chewy consistency of the dough.Their pizza tasted fine, but I wasn't blown away by the dough or topping. We also had their calamari which was rich and tasty. But I didn't like the fact that for four people, we had to pay quite a bit for bite sized snacks.  Compared to other unique pizza experiences in town like Famosos or Una, Pulcinella kinda fell short. Then again I'm not a big fan of small pizzas that have to be justified as authentic.Places like Pulcinella are where people, who watched a marathon of Food Network shows, rush to because Buddy-Mc-Saint-Francis traveled to Italy to have the REAL thing and waved his shiny golden piece of pizza in front of the camera telling us lazy uninspired slobs to empty our bank accounts to fly over there on a whim.   Anyways, I like my pizza big, greasy, and loaded with caloric regrets."}
{"text":"Had another lovely meal here. Always consistent ....love the appetizer sharing plate. Our server, Lindsay is wonderful...she has served us before, and is very efficient and most enjoyable ..."}
{"text":"I love Pulcinella, it's my go-to venue for a lovely meal or to celebrate an event. Tucked into cozy Kensington, the atmosphere is upscale but not *too* much. It's always bustling with happy patrons taking in the scent of traditional Napoli-style, oven baked pizza. If you're going here, be prepared for an experience very much unlike that you would find at Pizza Hut or other chain restaurants, or even other fantastic pizza places like Mitlini's or Paul's Pizza and Steak House. This is traditional pizza, which means a very thin crust, a generous smear of homemade sauce, and seemingly sparse toppings. No \"loaded with meat\" here; it's all about the experience--to savor the crust, the quality toppings (prosciutto, mozzarella, artichoke) and the interplay of your senses, not simply taste. Pulcinella isn't a place you go for a quick slice--it's a destination. They built it that way. It's true! The oven was placed first and then the restaurant built up around it. They want you to come for the food, for the experience, for the attention to detail. While you're at it, order the antipasto platter, I promise you won't find another that exceeds expectations so readily anywhere else in Calgary. The massive platter is easily split between four (or more) diners and is loaded with a host of traditional Italian delights: eggplant, prosciutto, warm sun-dried olives, peppers, stuffed olives. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's important to know that Pulcinella isn't a normal pizza joint, at least not for Canada. You won't find super deluxe triple bacon pizzas or random ingredients that don't make a lot of sense for a traditional pizza.  Nope, the food served with the pizza being the focus, is traditional Italian food. This is Napoletana style Pizza. The ingredients used are of the highest quality and truly make the pizza the delicious creation that it is.  The atmosphere is fun, but elegant. It's great for a date or a small group of friends. There is a great wine selection and as a whole, it's simply a great experience for everyone."}
{"text":"I had pasta and my wife had pizza. Seriously the best of each we've ever had. The manager was very friendly to everyone in the restaurant. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Have only been for lunch.  Fantastic pizza and good selections of starters."}
{"text":"I think our mistake was coming here for something other then Pizza. I ordered the Gnocci and Emily ordered the Lasagna and we both left feeling rather underwhelmed. It was nice but not excellent which you would expect from the prices. I may come back again and have a pizza however as they did look good and the service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Best italian style pizza in town. Authentic thin crust forno oven pizza."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first visit to Pulcinella over the weekend. We had the mussels with prosecco, and gnocchi - everything was delicious!   The restaurant was not overly busy or loud (we got there early prior to going to The Nutcracker), and the service was great. They also have a state-of-the-art espresso machine - great for a Bailey's coffee before heading back out into the cold!  I will definitely be back - I would really like to try their pizzas."}
{"text":"Wow, everyone on Yelp either loves Pulcinella or will NEVER go back there! I guess that's a strategy to keep new customers coming? To try their luck?  This restaurant has a special place in my heart, as I went there on my husband and I's first date, and we went there the night he proposed. He didn't propose in the restaurant, but the servers helped him with a small portion of it. That's a story for another time, and probably another medium unless I can review his marriage proposal on here.   BUT, I will say that I don't really love the food there. We went twice (the two occasions listed above) and I made sure to tell him that I wasn't really interested in going there on every special occasion because I didn't really love the food.   I see what everyone means about the crust and the sogginess. I can't speak to how it's served in Italy, so I'm not sure if it's authentic. We probably won't go back there for a long time, it is indeed pretty spendy and it doesn't really blow you away."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Monday. My husband and I both ordered the italian sandwiches. We were surprised at how big they were since they were both less than 10$. I had the veggie one with eggplant which was really outstanding. Would definitely come back if we lived in the area. Service was very quick as the place wasn't busy at all, but I imagine it does get busy on Fridays or Saturdays."}
{"text":"Food: The pizza is the best around and they use real buffalo mozzarella. Stick to the basics with the pizza options, some of their creations take away from the greatness of true Italian pizza. Ambiance: Busy and live with a cool modern decor. Price: Too much for simple Italian far.  Would I go again? Yes but I still think I'm over paying. This is why they lose a star."}
{"text":"I think I just ordered the wrong dish, seeing as their specialty is actually their traditional Italian pizzas and pastas and I chose the mussels. They tasted really fishy and salty, the sauce wasn't great, and therefore I wasn't a fan. That said, the staff were super friendly, the wine was divine, and the space is aesthetically pleasing.   It's got more of a modern look than an authentic old-school Italian trattoria or osteria, however you still maintain a sense of that tradition with the aromas of the food, and the black and white photographs on the walls of Italian markets, parked vespas on cobblestone, portraits and such.  Sure I would try it again, the small taste of the pizza I had was fantastic, so I'd stick to ordering one of their specialties."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Food was amazing! Always a pleasure coming here. Thank you for the wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Though review to write as I'm torn...  bottom line, this place rocks and it's amazing, but I think it could be one notch better...   The atmosphere, hang, and environment is awesome!  The service, staff and way the restaurant was run was too notch.  The drinks, quality of ingredients, and everything we ate was amazing!  But, my one big complaint... being I LOVE (and seek out) a proper Neapolitan pizza...  the pizzaiolo (pizza maker) \"killed\" the delicate, delicious, dough...  the dough looked fermented nicely, was in nice round airy balls, but then he killed all the delicate air bubbles and took the life out of a proper Neapolitan crust by slamming it on the counter over and over and over and over (see photo)...  slow down and treat it MUCH more delicate and light handed please!!!  Other than that, this place rocks!  Just please treat the dough with a MUCH softer touch and this place will really stand out!!!"}
{"text":"Pulcinella introduced Calgary to Neopolitan pizza over 10 years ago.  The pizza here is excellent and the wine list is very deep.  I usually opt for the cheap Chianti which is the perfect pizza wine.  The pizzas are big for one person but small for 2 people so we usually end up ordering 2 pizzas.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! The thin crust is cooked to perfection. The cheese is generous, but not 'too cheesy'. Service is pretty good. Decor is quite nice and interesting. The perfect place for an cozy and lovely meal."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, this is not your morphed North American pizza altered to fit North American tastes, it's the real thing! I ordered the Quattro Stagione and was very good, crust was thin, crispy on the outside and chewy inside.  Wines: they have a very good selection of Italian wines, not cheap but if you like south European wines these are excellent. I had a couple glasses of Sardinian wine, loved it!  Had a wee bit of room left for desert...I ordered the Tiramisu.....it was good... But I'm originally from an island very close to Sicily so I have had better.  Service: very good, pleasant, attentive and knowledgable on what they are offering"}
{"text":"This place is in a very cool location in the middle of kensington and it is a quite fancy restaurant.   We did have to wait for a little bit even though we had reservations at 830 but the staff was very nice and the service was great!  The pizza is a very nice thin crust with a nice mixture of flavours and it is quite filling!   It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had but it was quite delicious. I highly recommend getting the Nutella on fresh pizza dough for desert it was incredible"}
{"text":"Another stop on my brief weekend in Calgary.  We were brought here for dinner by our amazing conference leaders...LOVED the neighborhood!   All of our meal was chosen for us which was completely fine by me...luckily we were able to sample what I can only imagine is EVERY single pizza that they make! Because it was prearranged, I am not familiar with the names of each pizza.  But each one was delicious! One of my favorites had what I believe was a bacon/ham of sorts and was absolute perfection!  The crust is thin and crispy and the toppings and sauces are fresh and flavorful!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend or two, and I had a tad-above-average prosciutto e rucola pizza here.  My server brought some chili oil unprompted, thank you very much, and continued to check on me frequently throughout the meal.  Okay, props for the Neapolitan thin crust, but it was sadly a bit too chewy and didn't quite have that great mix of dough and a bit of crackle/sparkle that a great thin crust has.  At $24, the pizza was satisfying without ever soaring, so to speak.  What really stuck in my craw was that when I asked for some sparkling water - and I was dining alone, mind you - my server brought to the table an already opened 750mL bottle, which added a whopping $8 to my bill.  The temerity!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Pizza was delightful.  Extensive wine selection.  Good beer selection.  Definitely will come again"}
{"text":"My Rustica pizza was superb - not super cheesy, sloppy American style, but light on the cheese, heavy on the flavor and covered with Arugula. Loved it! For dessert we had something made with Nutella, strawberries & mascarpone between thin-slice pizza dough, a homemade Nutella Gelato, and even a couple of Nutella lattes. The service was great, the atmosphere fun. My choice for authentic Italian food in downtown Calgary!"}
{"text":"Tasty thin crust pizza in the traditional neopolatin style.  Great fresh ingredients with good portion sizes.   Service is prompt and friendly and they are quick to replenish water.  The menu has a nice variety if starters and desserts as well but I've only had pizza as my main. Wine selection is good both price and variety.   My only negative is it is loud!    I don't know if it's the design of the room or just the patrons but it always feels like people are yelling.  If you are looking for a quiet night out not the place but if you want a place with lots if energy it's great.   Lots if families dining with kids oh and they are not what makes it loud well in more than anyone else anyway but definitely family friendly."}
{"text":"We unintentionally dined at Pulcinella twice on our recent visit to Calgary.  It is fortunate that it turned out this way as our second time experience was better than our first (2 vs 4 stars for the food and service, averaged here to 3 stars).  The restaurant has a modern, sophisticated and lively air.  Brighter and more relaxed in the bar area up front and a little moodier in the back.  Open kitchen which the kids really seem to like.  On the expensive side, but a plethora of pizzas to choose from including more sauceless options than I'd considered existing, and all sounding delicious.  These are actual authentic Napoletana pizzas.  Thin crust, wood-fired, served with a side of chili oil.  The pastas are ample in size.  I tried the Ravioli di Zucca - butternut squash, mascarpone, and pistachios - and they were beautifully presented and quite flavorful.  The sangria is amazing.  I could easily drink too many of them too quickly.  Here's a tip, though: don't.  They are $13 a pop and are only served by the glass.  We racked up quite the sangria bill between the six of us!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and a nice and clean environment. The service is excellent and it is my family's favourite Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"I have 2 experiences at Pulcinella that I'm going to write about today.  One was part of a large group.  The other, as a couple.  Group  My fiance & I had a great idea a few years ago to start organizing big group dinners.  It would vary between 10 and 20 people and we would choose the location.  We only managed to have a few of them, before it stopped for a reason I can't recall at this moment.  Pulcinella was one of our stops.  The service during the group visit was great.  It wasn't excellent, but it was pretty solid.  It doesn't affect my rating as large groups are generally a nightmare for servers.  I don't think I've ever had excellent service as a group.  Our group was somewhere between 10 and 15 people.  The food was fantastic.  Everyone got what they wanted and everything tasted delicious.  After dinner, we weren't rushed out or pressured into leaving.  That was nice, as there wasn't a lot of alcohol being consumed.  Couple  Considering it's the same restaurant, I was surprised that the group experience and couple experience were so different.  The service was excellent.  But Pulcinella seems to pay attention to placement.  I've been to restaurants where couples are placed next to large, loud groups with total ignorance to any romantic evening you may have planned.  In my experience, Pulcinella is not one of those restaurants.  Due to the open space, it can get loud no matter where you are sitting.  It's worse though, if you're seated next to a group of partiers.  The decor and atmosphere is great.  Despite it's open concept, it still has a very cozy feel to it.  And it's in the heart of Kensington, which means your options are limitless after dinner is done."}
{"text":"My cousins and I came here for a post wedding ceremony snack. There was 4 four of us and we ordered the calamari friti, arancini and rigatoni. Well it was all very delicious cause my out of town guests were all quite happy. They also have quite high standards when it comes to food as they live in YYZ a city of fine food haven."}
{"text":"I would come here just to eat 5 desserts for dinner.   I've been a few times now and each time has been better than the last. I adore their wine menu; so much to choose and of everything I've had, it's all delicious. Their menu has a little something for everyone. Their pasta is really incredible, and their pizza is pretty amazing too, although for someone who usually ends up with food on them, having to slice my own pizza usually results in some kind of clothing disaster here. But you know what? It's totally worth it.   Now to the desserts. I've been a tiramisu lover as long as I can remember and this place has been my tiramisu saviour. I expected a teeny little couple of forkfuls of the coffee and chocolate flavoured heaven-square but this was huge. The first time I went my friend ordered the panna cotta but was pretty stuffed and couldn't finish it, so I ate that too because it was amazing. Not even ashamed to say it. Hence why I'd go back just for the desserts."}
{"text":"My dd was out at a sleepover and to make ds feel special we allowed him to choose dinner. Not surprising \"Pizza\" was his choice.  So we did some research to find a new pizza joint to try since we are all pizza lovers to some degree or another.  We decided to try Pulcinella.  I've seen the advertisements in the city palate and read a lot of reviews online.  Admittedly I was a little skeptical going to this place because the reviews were mostly 50/50...or just so/so.  In the end it was the first night of the Calgary Stampede and since this place was relatively close to home and we had a small dude in tow...we decided to partake and try it out.  Firstly having been to many restaurants with kids, this is NOT a kid friendly restaurant in my opinion.  Kid friendly restaurants have kid options.  Maybe not a \"kids\" menu per-se but they still will make and offer kid friendly foods to you.  The only option this restaurant has is what's on the adult menu.  Well I'm sorry, my kid can not eat a 11-12 inch pizza for $16.  And so to share one with him means one of us has to eat cheese or pepperoni pizza (which does get kind of boring after awhile).    They also do not have kid friendly beverages.  Do you have chocolate milk?....yes we do. Waitress comes back, we ran out of the chocolate mix and so I made one with nutella.  Enter deer in headlights look.  \"Um ok he can try it\" but come on really you are either a nutella fan or not...there are no in-betweens.  He was clearly not.  Fortunately we were not charged for the nutella infused milk, but on the other hand we were not offered an alternative...just brought nutella in milk....drink it...or not.  Hmmm.  Also there is nothing in the restaurant for kids.  Most kid friendly places will have something small to offer them to help keep them entertained, this place has nothing.  Fortunately we have learned after 7 years of visiting restaurants with kids to bring our own activities when these little people can not sit still no matter what so we are typically prepared.  In the end one of us shared a pizza with our boy.  And the pizza's WERE delicious.  Hubs and I also shared the Aracini for an appy.  Having never had it before we did not know what to expect besides what we have seen on The Chew and other Food Network Shows/Chefs who have made this dish.  What I did not expect was a mushy inside and wasn't there supposed to be cheese in it?  Outside was crispy, inside very bland and mushy.  Is this what an Aracini is?  If so I suppose my expectations were way to high and I have learned something new :)  Everything is rather pricey here including wine by the glass.  Several other places offer it for at least $2-$3 less....even the Winebar a couple doors down.  Also the only wine options they offer are Italian...which is fine if you do not like anything but Italian wine.  While I'm certainly happy I tried this place I have to say I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"I was in Kensington and it was lunch time, I looked around and saw a couple signs for pubs.  I looked on Yelp to see which pub was rated higher, so I went into the pub, and found...not a pub at all.  There is a sign for a pub outside, and Ristorante Pulcinella is not well marked out at all.  So, I came across this Italian joint completely by mistake.  I was greeted by a lovely young woman who showed me a menu and then to my seat at the bar once I decided that this was a suitable alternative to the pub I was seeking.  My server came over, answered a few questions for me, and poured a pint of Carlsberg.  I saw the prominent wood fired oven in the back, and was told that pizza was there speciality, so it was a no brainer to get the Diavola pizza.  Tomato sauce, mozza, parm, spicy salami and basil.  My pizza arrived quickly.  A very good size, probably 12\" or so, thin crust, wood fired pizza.  It looked and smelled incredible!  Now, if you come here, don't expect what North Americans have come to think pizza should be.  There was a good coverage of toppings, but nothing over the top.  This is how pizza is actually done, the Italian way.  First bite and I was sold, tomato!  Tomato sauce that actually tastes like a tomato!  Who would have thought..  Fresh, bright and a little bit acidic, perfect!  I got into the pizza and the crust was very tasty, crispy on the edges, but it got pretty soggy in the middle as I ate.  The cheese was delicious, and the spicy salami was indeed spicy.  Not blow your face off hot, but the more you ate the warmer your mouth stayed.  The Carlsberg helped though.  I did find the pizza a bit oily.  I am not sure if it was olive oil drizzled on, or if it was the rendered fat from the salami, not complaining, but I did mention the soggy crust.  Service was good, I was not there at a busy time though.  Food was very nice.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Feeling loved in Kensington :)  I have been in contact with the restaurant on Facebook. I LOVE their ricotta ball soup, but haven't had it lately. The soup frequently changes, and it's never available when I'm there. After making the request on FB to have the soup, they made it for me and then contacted me so I wouldn't miss out. That's fantastic service!  I have not been able to digest pizza lately, so I cannot comment on that menu item. However, I enjoy their Arancini balls, and I love the salty/sweet combination of their Parmesan Tempura, which is served on some greens and drizzled in Balsamic Vinegar. You get five to an order. I follow that with the polenta lasagna and I am set for my meal and two lunches of leftovers.  This is my favorite place to come after window shopping in Kensington :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Pulcinella last Friday after Beerfest. I've been here a few times already but the boyfriend hasn't, and after a failed attempt at Wine Bar (no tables), we walked over here. My boyfriend was worried he would stick out because he was wearing a hat, but there were a few casually dressed people in the bar so we went in anyway. It was really busy but we sat at the bar and ordered some drinks. I love the decor here, it's really classy and trendy. I happily sipped my Prosecco and we decided to order a pizza - when in Rome, right? We chose the Funghi. To be completely honest, I wasn't hugely impressed. I know that 'authentic' Italian pizza is very thin, and that's fine, but the pizza seemed almost...soggy. It definitely hit the spot for us since we had been drinking all evening, but I actually prefer Una to Pulcinella. However, the arancini is absolutely delicious and again, the decor is outstanding. Service was great, we actually moved over to a table once it opened up and the waitress was super sweet and accommodating. Love the vibe here but I'd skip the pizza."}
{"text":"Great, hip restaurant especially if you're looking for something new and different. I went there for a nice dinner with my mother and my mother-in-law.   On the upside, all three of us agreed the calamari was the best we'd ever tasted.   However, my mum had an Americano. It came in a little tea cup - which maybe is traditional Italian? It spilt everywhere. In it's tea cup.   On the way back in the house, my mum had asked me if she had done something to insult the waitress. I said not at all and asked her why? She explained to me that her pizza came with absolutely no toppings - and that it was burnt. She assumed she gave the waitress the dirty eye ball by accident and hence forth got a topping less pizza.   Yes, traditional Italian pizza has a nice crispy crust and sparse toppings but looking at the boxed up leftovers, there was nothing but sauce on that Margarita pizza - and that sauce was tinned, stewed tomato's. Then my mum counted three pieces of basil. And then she said \"My pizzas are usually raw and burnt but it's because I put too many toppings on them.\""}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever!  I've travelled to Italy a few times, once to Naples. I've had pizza in the land where it was created. I'm not ashamed to admit that I believe the pizza here is some of the best I've ever had.  I've gone a few times now and know what I like: start with an order of arancini. If life gets any better than deep-fried, cheese-stuffed risotto I don't want to know about it.  The for the main course a diavola pizza, with an extra order of oven-roasted garlic. It arrives hot and everything is delicious.  The attention to authenticity and fresh ingredients put all other pizzas in town to shame. I am literally unable to eat pizza from anywhere else without comparing it to here. in a way, they've ruined pizza for me because this is now \"the bar\".  I make my reservations with OpenTable, which makes it ridiculously easy. I go alone sometimes, when I'm just craving good pizza, and the folks behind the bar are always good for some conversation.   The atmosphere is classy and contemporary, with heavy white/black decor. The bathrooms are clean and very modern, and just tucked away enough to make it fun. The kitchen is mostly visible, with emphasis on the wood-fired over from which the pizza deliciousness comes."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasion, and finally I can write a review. It's been quite finnicky in terms of food quality, and I didn't want to give it a stellar review and change my mind shortly after.  On some of the good days, or not so busy hours, the pizza is fabulous, crust is thin and cooked just right, cheese is melted just right, the prosciutto is just perfectly crunchy to the bite, and the basil is fragrant. Service is pleasant and keeps your water bottle replenished.  On bad days or busy hours, the bottoms of the pizza are completely soggy, the prosciutto is chewy and the other toppings are just everywhere. Service drops significantly, or plain MIA.  The only things that are consistent on their menu are the apetitizers and dessert. The SALTI NBOCCA is TO DIE FOR. Well, anything spread with nutella is always good. Overall, I really enjoy my meals here, I just learn to come at less busy hours."}
{"text":"Came here for an event the other night. Therefore this review will be based on that experience.   We had a variety of items to choose from already on the tables before we arrived. For an appetizer, we were provided with heaping amounts of calamari, which were already drizzled with lemon. I loved the texture of said calamari, but the coating/batter got soggy quite quickly. The seasoning was perfect on it though, so all of us at the table finished the heaping pile quite quickly.   Unsure of what the pizzas we got were, as the server did not indicate such to us. The pizzas were brought out throughout our lecture as well. Flavours were okay, but 3 out of the 5 seemed very similar to each other, albeit there was the addition of a different type of green on top. I fell in love with one of the pizzas that had sausage on it; it was the only meat pizza we got that night, and I loved the spice that followed each bite.   Of the pizzas, we found a majority of them to be quite oily, or burned at the bottom. Not pleasant when you're listening to a lecture and getting the sad after taste of burnt bread. As I've stated before, I was listening to a lecture throughout dinner. For some reason the servers decided not to cut our pizzas for us, and to provide us with a pizza cutter. We didn't touch one of the pizzas as it was uncut, and we did not want to disturb the talk with our loud pizza cutting. Suggestion to the servers catering these events would be to provide precut portions, but also to remember to bring serving utensils (we ended up picking the pizza up with clean forks from clean settings beside us).  Please remember to treat all attendees equal as well. I would have loved to be offered wine throughout the night like other attendees at the lecture, asking for my ID isn't that difficult to do! I was only given sparkling water sparingly throughout the night.; after having to wave down the server two times, I just gave up and waited patiently for when he walked by.  We were able to end off the night with a sweet touch though. We were provided with a nutella dessert. It resembled a nutella quesadilla cut into strips and sprinkled with powdered sugar. My sweet tooth and I loved it; but it was VERY messy to eat. We got nutella every where but our mouths.  Overall, loved the cosy environment we were seated in upstairs for the lecture. Would not mind going to other events here in the future as well."}
{"text":"I want to give a fair review so I'll give you a full picture of my dining experience a couple of evenings ago and you can make your own judgement. I Was with a big group of ~16 or so which I know is not an easy size. Reservation was for 730. Half an hour to get drinks order, ordered around 8. Okay fair enough. I decided against ordering appetizers and just went for entrees instead. Others in the group did order appetizers. Now usually a waitress will comment, hey we'll be serving up the appetizers first and pizzas second if that's okay or do you want your pizzas earlier? Something of that nature. Instead, it was a full hour and 15 minutes before my food arrived so I ate at 9:15pm for a 730 reservation. And when we asked for where the food was, all we got was oh, it's on its way with absolutely concern whatsoever. And by the time the food arrived, I'll be honest, The spicy salami pizza was pretty good, albeit a bit too salty. The mushroom pasta I ordered was the most disappointing pasta I've ever had in a restaurant setting. It tasted like canned tomatoes with some pieces of mushroom. The sauce was one dimensional and lacked any flavour. I'll be fair, The pasta itself was nicely done and a great texture but the sauce ruined it entirely. Haven't had such an upsetting experience from a restaurant in a while that I had to come back to yelp to write a review."}
{"text":"5 star.  The service can be hit it miss sometimes, but the food quality has been fantastic everytime.  Been 3x.  Only had suspect service once, and the other 2 were professional, friendly and entertaining. As for the menu, if it looks good, it is.  Simple as that."}
{"text":"I loved everything about Pulcinella...the trendy yet comfortable decor, the vibe, the friendly and knowledgeable staff and most of all the FOOD!  It is fairly expensive but I felt that it was worth every cent.  The food was served very quickly, my friend and I split the arancia e finicchio salad followed by the wild mushroom pizza and for dessert the saltinbocca (Nutella pizza).  We were both sporting food babies by that point but seriously considered getting another pizza because the first one was so amazing.  We rolled out of Pulcinella full and very happy..."}
{"text":"2 out of 3 ain't bad. I ordered the gluten free base with my pizza (celiac not a choice) I was a huge disappointment. The base was extremely bland and possibly undercooked the pizza was only moderately warm. That said the toppings were delicious. Such amazing flavours. My two friends were really impressed and happy with their pizzas (normal - not gluten free)  I scooped off the toppings and ate them leaving almost 1/2 my base behind. The waiter noticed and asked me about my pizza. He was profusely apologetic which was lovely because it wasn't a big deal to me.  When he came with the bill he didn't charge for my pizza which was such a pleasant surprise. I would recommend this to everyone - maybe the base was personal taste. Service and flavour of the toppings was amazing."}
{"text":"I went to pickup pizzas there few days ago. I like pizza from Pulcinella, cause it's as close as you can get here, as far as real Italian pizza (although a top standard pizza in Italy is something else!). The $24 one had canned mushrooms on a top and strips of some mediocre ham. Still they do have a buffalo mozzarella and arugula as an option for pizza topper- much appreciated! I've asked if they would cut pizza for me, and they told me they don't do that, what I would even accept, till the mail server (that I regularly see there) told me they can bring me a cutter and I can cut myself. So I was there, in the middle of the restaurant cutting my pizza, which was absolutely inappropriate and embarrassing. Than after handing them my cash, they've asked me if I want any change, on an over 10% of a bill expected change. Is that a question one should make to any customer, but particularly someone who didn't even have any kind of seated service.Totally rude!  So, overall a disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent Caprese salad, when they have the Buffalo cheese. Very good Pizza although I do miss the Stromboli style pizza they did before the name change. Had the Tiramisu for dessert and I think they made an error to 'update' the classic."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and amazing service. Great selection of wine. They work well with allergies and provide plenty of options for kids. Fun to watch them making the pizza. Love the arrancini. Skip the carbonara. Less traditional and more olive garden ish."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!! Good wine and great service!!... I have been here a couple times and in both cases I had a great experience! The service was very friendly and the food was great!! From the appetizers to the desserts! They definitely deserve to have 4 stars !"}
{"text":"This place is over priced, loud, and the menu seemed kind of limited.  The pizzas were just okay. There were seven of us at a table and the service was really slow. No one at our table seemed really wowed by their food.  Stick with famoso if you want a thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Fair quality but over priced. Menu quite pedestrian. Not sure why so popular. Location I guess"}
{"text":"Love Pulcinella! Cute restaurant in the middle of lovely Kensington. It's a little noisy when it's busy but the food and service are always wonderful. They also accommodate for large groups which is fantastic!"}
{"text":"So I decided to try out yet another pizza place. I had my fingers crossed that this place would turn out to have the best pizza in Calgary, but unfortunately I was left disappointed.   Upon entering the restaurant I was surprised to see how busy it was on a Thursday evening and this got me excited that maybe I had found the next best pizza and had maybe been missing out on something big by never having been here before. We waited about 10 mins for a table for 2 and were then seated in the main dining area. The decor was interesting and had an upscale feel. Maybe a little too upscale for what I prefer but thats a personal opinion. The music was also a little too loud which made it difficult to carry on a conversation.  No complaints with the service. A menu was brought over right away and we were faced with a huge selection of pizzas to choose from. There were some other tasting sounding appies and pasta dishes but we went primarily to try the pizza.  We decided to start with the bruschetta as an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised with this start to our meal. Very tasty!!  We finally decided on 2 pizzas to order; the pulcinella and the capricciosa were delivered to our table promptly. However I am sad to say that I did not discover the next best pizza in Calgary. The centre of the crust was soggy, the ingredients seemed somewhat cheap, the toppings were also a little too scarce and was just an overall disappointment.  I am such a pizza lover that I  will normally keep eating pizza way past the point that my stomach tells me to stop, however this pizza didn't keep my appetite past a couple slices.  We boxed up the rest and I haven't even been intrigued enough to bother with the leftovers. Also felt this pizza was way over priced for what it was.  Id maybe come back here for appies and wine and possibly to give the pasta a shot but if I'm in the mood for pizza there are many better Neapolitan pizza options in town. I 'll have to give this one a pass."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great and very friendly.  Great appies and salad. The meatball is a must with a pasta order."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with a friend, I was looking for somewhere else so glad I found this place instead. I had the parmigiano, it was fantastic. It's kind of a rustic neapolitan pizza place their wine selection looks amazing though because it was a lunch I didn't get to try it. The service was super friendly and the food came out really quickly ideal for a lunch.  We shared the calamari appetizer which was also amazing. Cooked perfectly nice and tender with a ever-so-slightly spicy tomato sauce  The decor is really nice clean and well looked after. But nice old floors really give a nice atmosphere to the overall Ambiance of the restaurant.  I will definitely have to come back and try this place for dinner at some point."}
