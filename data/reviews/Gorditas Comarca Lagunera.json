{"text":"The food has a great homemade quality to it. Definitely try the Gorditas. Atmosphere could use some work, and the neighborhood is not the best, but the food is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great place! The employees are so friendly and welcome you with a smile. The gorditas are very delicious! I had chicharon con chile verde and carne con chile rojo. Will come back!!"}
{"text":"Felt like home made food. It was delicious. My favorite was the chicharron con chile verde. To bad there isn't a place like this in LA."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place, really clean and the food is amazing!!!!!! I've been looking for a traditional mexican place for a long time and this is definitely traditional, I live really far but will be coming back as often as I can"}
{"text":"The gorditas here are sooooo good ! AMAZING ! The atmosphere is also very relaxing. Food takes awhile but thats because its freshly made. You can see them making the food also. The horchata is great too. Everything else on the menu i have not tried but the Gorditas are the reason i come here"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they open this new location. Their food is always fresh and great tasting. Family owned and operated and the owner is always greeting his customers like family."}
{"text":"The Gordita's were very good, but they still aren't the same as the ones I grew up with (I have never heard of a \"flour\" Gordita).  The Gorditas themselves were a little flat.  The fillings were all delicious, though.  We tried almost all of them.  We tried the Picadillo, Chicharron, Carne con Chile Verde and one Picadillo in a flour shell.  We also tried a Barbacoa taco, a Chile Relleno, a Tamale and an order of Enchiladas.  The food was all good (four stars), the prices were reasonable.  The Horchata was very authentic, you could tell it was fresh made (not some pre-mix crap).  The only negative was that they were out of a lot of the things on their menu.  It was a Saturday lunch, they really should not have been out of hot dogs (we wanted to try the Sonoran hot dog).  Picadillo is very hard to find here in AZ, so it is always nice to find (and even better if it is good, as it is here).  If not for the missing menu items and if the Gordita's were a little fluffier, this place would have gotten a solid four stars, as is, it is 3 1/2."}
{"text":"Real authentic gorditas with great service. Our food was served fast and fresh. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Man, this place is delicious. These gorditas taste like they are straight out of my grandmother's kitchen. I ordered 3 corn gorditas (chile and cheese, red beef, and green chicharron) and one flour(bean and cheese) and washed it down with a Mexican Coke.  Not only does the food taste homemade, but the place feels like it too. It is nothing fancy, but it is clean. The restaurant is run by a family and the owner takes pride in serving good, fresh food. While we were there he came to check on us and made us feel like part of his family. He told us that all the food is made fresh everyday and reiterated that if you don't like something, you don't have to pay for it.  Now all I keep doing is thinking about when I will be back to eat these amazing gorditas because I haven't stopped craving them since the day I had them.  Warning: the green chile is definitely hot, beware :)"}
