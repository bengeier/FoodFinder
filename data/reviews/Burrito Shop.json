{"text":"The tiny burrito bowl cost about $12. And all side ingredients except rice, beans cheese and salsa cost extra. A sprinkle of lettuce for 75 cents. Plus the staff is unfriendly at times. I an going to stop giving them a chance. No more for me!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak burrito with beans, rice, cheese, salsa verde, and sour cream. I may have gotten a bad batch, but the meat was under cooked and had thick pieces of solid fat.  Tex Mex in Montreal is scarce as is, so I hope this bad experience was an exception."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow slow. The food  is average at best, but then again I am not an expert in Mexican food all I can tell you is it wasn't anything special. But the service, holy moley did it ever take long to get my burrito. The only thing the place had going for it was it was cheap."}
{"text":"What a great find.  During a recent weekend trip to Montreal we wondered into this place and glad we did.  The food was fresh and delicious and the staff was phenomenal.  I can't stress just how nice everyone was here, putting up with us loud Americans and answering all our questions before they turned out some really great Mexican food.  We loved it and love the people who work here.  Thanks for serving us a great Saturday night dinner before a night of partying in Montreal."}
{"text":"Passable Burritos. Much Better Tacos.  When this place opened, I was super stoked at the prospect of finally being able to get the kind of burritos here in Montreal that you can find in LA or San Fran. Alas, that wasn't the case.  The burritos are passable, but kinda on the bland side. It also seems to take the staff a while to prepare them.  If you're going to try this place, though, give the Tacos a shot. They're much more authentic than the burritos, and have loads more flavor to offer.  Another redeeming quality is that they have Mexican Coca Cola. If you don't get the deal about that, it's that Mexican Coke is still made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, and tastes much better."}
{"text":"Tout juste arrivées à Montréal, il nous fallait trouver une bonne adresse pour remplacer notre meilleure burrito à Glasgow: Pinto.   Nous avons essayé une première adresse et avons été très déçues par à peu près tous les composants de nos burritos.  Pour notre deuxième tentative, nous avons essayé la Burrito Shop et avons adoré!   C'est sûr, il ne fait pas y aller pour la déco comme on irait dans un bon restaurant! Il s'agit ici d'une adresse pratique pour acheter à emporter ou consommer sur place sur le pouce. Mais les burritos y sont vraiment bons! J'ai apprécié chaque ingrédient, la tortilla, le riz, le porc, les haricots...tout était vraiment bon!  Vous pourrez choisir un burrito au poulet, boeuf, porc (trois sortes différentes qui ont toute l'air vraiment bonnes!) ou végé, choisir votre sauce etc. Ils ont aussi d'autres plats au menu mais je n'ai pas trop creusé la question.   En résumé, si vous êtes à la recherche d'un burrito savoureux, bien préparé et efficace pour couper votre faim, je vous conseille vraiment cet endroit!"}
{"text":"Beans are hard and undercooked, burritos overpriced. They're only in business because there aren't a lot of decent quick options around."}
{"text":"Expensive + SMALL Burrito for $12. Not impressed. Either lower the prices or make the burritos bigger? Used to more filling options, and they didn't have refried beans. Taste was average. Not bad, but nothing to write home about.   All that said, there aren't a lot of Burrito options in Montreal. So if you have to, it's not bad quality. You certainly could do worse."}
{"text":"Best burrito ever. Especially the burrito bowl. Simply delicious. I do not see how people complain about the service because I always get good service. I guarantee you will not get a better burrito anywhere in Quebec. These guys do what they do, and they do it well."}
{"text":"Le meilleur que j ai testé jusqu'à maintenant, bien au dessus du m4..copieux et prix correct 16$ a deux. Un bon choix de salsa et on retrouve des vrais gouts de mexique, j y retournerai avec plaisir, seul hic le guacamole est en supplement! Pourtant c est la baaase! Mais ca j ai cru comprendre que c etait pareil partout! Dommage, mais si booon"}
{"text":"Service lent et médiocre, ambiance quelconque, mais surtout un des pires burrito que j'ai mangé : beaucoup trop salé, j'ai dû en jeter la moitié. Fuyez cette place."}
{"text":"I had a few turn-offs with this place and one good thing to say.  Let's start with the good: -- the taco I ordered was tasty.  Taste is the reason the rating went up from one star to two stars.  Now for the bad: -- the price.  Yelp has this place listed with one dollar sign ($) but I have to disagree.  I paid $3 for a very small taco.  Took me three bites to eat it.  That's $1 a bite.  It wasn't at all filling.  When I walked up to the cashier and asked for one taco, his reply was, \"is that it?\"  I began to suspect something might be wrong but said nothing.  There was some sort of shift change occurring and so there was a five minute wait while that occurred.  When the new person came on, he confirmed my order with me and said, \"is that it?\"  This time, I came right out and said, \"well, I don't know.  How big are your tacos?  That's what the last guy said.  Are they small or something?  I figured for $3 they must be pretty big.\"  He held up a taco and I saw it was pretty small but went ahead with the order anyways, out of embarrassment--I wasn't going to just walk out of the place with my friend.  So, for tacos at least, it's too pricey.  My friend ordered a burrito and it was around $7, so maybe that's approaching a little more reasonable.  On the other hand, the soft drink cups for the soda pop fountain are $3.50.  Are you serious?!  Way too expensive.  My advice would be to lower the price at least on the tacos.  Trois Amigos is giving them away for $0.67 on their sale day (every Sunday or Wednesday... I forget which one).  I see that the owner/manager has responded to previous Yelp reviews where the reviewer cited price as an issue.  The owner responds about competition and staying in business but, honestly, I don't know anyone charging $3.50 for a cup of soda pop / soft drink.  My suggestion here is to review the competition and adjust prices accordingly.  -- the service.  I read other people's reviews of this place and another Yelper  (Raluca D.) commented on the service, too.  I can understand what he or she is referring to.  I'm not sure if I'd quite describe the staff as \"rude\" so much as too \"testosterone pumped.\"  There seemed to be some drive to be harsh and cool at the same time.  I'm referring to both speech and body language.  I didn't get one smile out of a single staff member.  I can't quite state it clearly perhaps, but the end result was an alienated customer.  The staff was distant and not at all friendly.  I don't know about you, but when I go to a place I'm looking for friendly staff when I'm forking over my hard-earned cash.  My advice would be for the Burrito Shop to hire a customer service consultant for a few hours to meet with its staff and give them some training on how to be friendlier.  -- the cleanliness / décor.  Nope.  Didn't work for me.  The first problem was the seat  we pulled out at the table.  It hadn't been cleaned.  Three other tables still had trays with wrappers on them from previous clients (and no, the clients hadn't just left--I'd been in line long enough to see the tables were not being cleaned).  As for the décor, it's like the place was leased out on a low budget (which is fine for a startup place) but, on the other hand, they're almost trying to make themselves look like a chain.  Now, I absolutely hate M4 (because of the nonchalant staff and how cheap they are on the ingredient choices--nope, can't have 4, just 2), but at least M4 has a nice clean look and they succeed at going for that chain store look.   My advice would be for the Burrito Shop to ditch the attempt at going for the chain store look and go for something a little more unique and personal.  It'd be cool to see some \"authentic\" décor (I'll let you decide on what that could mean) or even wallpaper with pictures of places in Mexico or San Francisco (etc.).  Clean up the price / menu board so that it doesn't look so \"ratty.\"  I see that there are older pictures here on Yelp of a chalkboard price menu and, do you know what?, that is much more aesthetically-pleasing that what is present at the moment.  -- the law.  Okay, go ahead and snicker at me... I paid $3 (plus tax) for my taco... but... the store didn't give me a receipt.  We live in Quebec and that's a big \"no-no\".  You do NOT want to mess with Revenu Quebec.  They will shut you down.  My recommendation, again, is employee training.  Employees need to be coached that every client must be offered a receipt (with the little Revenue Quebec special code thing and all on it).  Anyways, I hope this helps both potential future customers make a purchase decision and I hope it helps the restaurant improve itself since I practically live next door and would like to return someday once these things are rectified."}
{"text":"Second time around (actually it's the third or fourth, but second review) and this time my co-workers pitched in to help sample a bunch of different menu items and get some pictures going. So without further delay :  Burritos best choice, fastest counter service item, huge, filling. Comments from the floor \"What did they do, wrap the Taco Bell dog in a tortilla ?\" and \"This was only 6.99$ ?\"  Tacos fresh, yummy, love the steak, and the carnitas. Better with queso.  Nachos carnitas were good, but missing something .. can't decide what.  Grilled vegetarian salad was fresh and tasty, needs to be served with the guacamole on the side please, not pasted on top of the salad, and a lime slice would be plus.  Cheese quesadilla was good. Others with meat like the Barbacoa would likely rock.  On the whole, this visit was a 4 star. Service was a little slow because of the size of my order and I didn't think to call ahead (yes you should for large orders), and the fact that the nachos were just not .. there.  On the plus side, staff is always friendly, and you can hang around drinking Jarritos while you wait for your take-out."}
{"text":"I just moved from California, so I know my burritos.  I'm so glad I found this place!  They have like 8 different styles of meat, and their veggie burritos are awesome (they come with eggplant, zucchini and peppers).  They serve Chipotle style where you add whatever you want in your burrito.  Everything tastes home-made, and it's run by a family from Mexico.  They're super nice and make amazing food.  Couldn't recommend more!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Flavor. Poor Service. Incompetent Staff.  If you have any experience with taco/burrito stands in SoCal, you're likely to be disappointed. I've been here several times since it's opened, always going back to see whether they've figured things out yet, and sadly they have not.  The burritos are certainly very fresh, but they somehow lack in the flavor department. Perhaps there's just no love being put into them, which would make sense, as the staff is consistently slow, unattentive, and generally more interested in bros'ing it out than dealing with line-up.  The tacos, however, are usually pretty solid, and I'd recommend those if you're going to eat there. Above average tacos, though, aren't enough to justify a visit -- especially at the price point and given the customer service."}
{"text":"Very filling at a good price.  The Burrito is good  The Nacho plates is excellent really recomand"}
{"text":"Great place, love it, ive tried the chicken and porc burrito. in my opinion this place is better than the chipotle restaurants in the states and way better than M4 Burritos"}
{"text":"I think this place serves a very decent burrito bowl (way better than M4).  I ordered a Tinga (slow cooked porc) burrito divorciado (bowl) with the spiciest sauce they had (green one) and a portion of totopos maison (flat triangular corn product similar to a tortilla, cooked in house) and guacamole.  The burrito bowl was very flavorful and the totopos were delicious with the right amount of saltiness to it - the guac was OK  I would like to try their barbacoa next time.."}
{"text":"After walking up the Parc du Mont-Royal on cold and wet Saturday I needed something to warm and filling to eat. Decided on a Burrito and was in heaven from the first mouthful. I had the pulled pork burrito and it was fresh, hot and delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The burritos are DELICIOUS!  super tasty and its nice to be able to switch it up each time. The reason I'm not giving them more stars is that the service is REALLY slow. My office is just down the street so it is a great lunch option however I spend my entire lunch break waiting for the order to end up in my hands. I never write reviews, but I'm hoping they see this post and speed it up a bit. i constantly have the urge to hop over the counter and make it myself, poor time management. for example they should be putting the next tortilla on the warmer BEFORE starting to make the current sandwich.   One thing i do love is that they have a stamp card for returning customers where you get the 10th order free. If I'm being honest, this is the only reason I'm still going there with SUCH slow service."}
{"text":"Insalubre et salé.10$ pour un mini burrito trop salé, faits avec des mains sales par un air bête qui joue dans ses oreilles, touche à l'argent et manipule votre nourriture?. Dégueulasse."}
{"text":"Nice, clean shop and the ingredients are fresh. I was however disappointed with the service, which was slow and the staff who seemed uninterested.  I was also disappointed by the fact that the food was overpriced for what it was. I got a quesadilla for $7.25+tx, with no salsa on the side, as it was apparently extra (contrary to what the menu said); $1.99 for less than 2 tbsps of Guacamole. A beef or chicken burrito cost barely $2 more..."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé via Just-Eat.ca  La bouffe était super bonne. les burritos plutôt bourratifs mais en même temps très goûteux ! C'est la première fois que j'en mangeait un avec du riz dedans, disons que la moitié c'est amplement, même pour un grand appétit ! Pour 11$ c'est facilement séparable en 2, donc très économique. J'avais commandé une soupe aussi mais je ne l'ai jamais eue :( même si j'ai payé pour...). Le gars m'a dit qu'il viendrait me la porter plus tard mais il n'est jamais venu donc, je retranche une étoile car j'ai gaspillé de l'argent. La prochaine fois je ne commanderai pas mais j'irai directement la bas,  a la place."}
{"text":"Wow, I don't think I've ever had this much salt in my life. It's like the whole bottle was doused over the meal. Flavour is ok, if you can get over the saltiness of the food. I wouldn't recommend this place unless it's a late night snack after some heavy drinking."}
{"text":"Good burrito if you've never had a burrito before. So basically here's how this goes. In Montreal the burrito is 5/5. Drop it anywhere else in the world: 0/5. \"Did they just put white rice on my burrito? Oh dear. Uhh, excuse me? That's not how you roll a burrito, can I come back there and show you how?\" Also pricey, but might be the best you can settle for...  Okay, so I came here when they first opened and have not been back since. I'll have to give it a second chance to see if they have improved."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely rude and the service was slow even though me and my friend were the only clients. My burrito was ok, nothing special but my friend's quesadilla was a joke. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Your quest for the best burrito in Montreal may have ended here? This place reminds me of family-owned taco shops you so often see in SoCal. \"Burrito Shop\" owners offers you a choice of flour or corn tortilla, let you chose your favorite meat or vegetables, select a salsa (milt to spicy) and pick a cheese of your choice. My personal favorites are the Cochinita (slow cooked pork) and Barbacoa (braised beef) with mexican cream and cheese.  The only slight drawback is the wait time but I'm sure this will be ironed out shortly to be prepared to handle the summer rush! Looking forward to see progress and to stop again and taste of the cities most authentic giant burritos in town - for only 6.99!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a California style tex-mex burrito in Montreal forever and I found it. Not only did I find it, but it tasted exactly as I wanted it to."}
{"text":"Many people who reviewed that place say that they have been in California or Texas, that they know what good burritos taste like, etc. Well, I have also lived on the West Coast, been to CA and TX, and I was quite disappointed with this burrito place. I won't say I was surprised, because we live in Montreal and it's so hard to find good Mexican or Tex Mex food around here. But the service was slow, and I was not impressed with the food. For example, the fillings were not evenly placed in the burrito, so there were bites with just rice, nothing else. Don't waste your time and money there."}
{"text":"Yesterday night, both my boyfriend and I were craving mexican food. We searched on yelp for the best burritos in Montreal and we landed there.   We had the barbacoa and the carnitas and both tasted great. The salsa were spicy but not too much so that we could still taste the meat. For only 6,99$ it was really a great try.  The service was fast and the people were really nice. The place has the charm of an old joint that is a staple in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Alright for a quick fix of mexican food.  I am  fan of their quesadilla con pollo and a coke from mexico. Their horchata is okay also but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite burritos in Montreal!! Family owned and very authentic, love this small place! Service is really quick and they have take out or dine in. Must stop if you're looking for good priced great Mexican food"}
{"text":"Love this place, amazing burritos that remind me of home, but needs to be more well equipped and not close early.   I've been 5 times now and they never have what I want to order, they're always out of stock. I wanted to go tonight, they were supposed to close at 10, I got there at 9:30 and they were closed. Two people also arrived around the same time I did and were wholly upset that it was closed. If you're going to run a reputable business on St. Laurent, you can't close early. You lost $30 of potential revenue in the 2 minutes I was outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"By far the best burrito place in Montreal, on par with the best I've had in NYC (from there). Everything is homemade, made to order. I ordered carne asada, and I saw him throw it on the grill for me, then and there. Estefan (the owner) is a super nice guy, always willing to give a sample or make a suggestion for your meal. And when I say everything is home made, EVERYTHING is home made: tortilla, salsa, guacamole, teas, juices, you name it.   I absolutely cannot recommend this place enough. Please go!"}
{"text":"Coming from California, I hold my burrito shops to a high standard. I've lived in Montreal for a few years now, and every burrito joint has been a letdown (I can make better ones), until this one. Their burrito has everything you could expect from a good, mission-style burrito: a lot of quality, tender meat, hot salsa (rare here), pico de gallo, good sour cream, black (Not pinto!) beans, jalapenos, the works. And it's huge. And it's a better deal than eating out almost anywhere else in this city. My Texan friend and I were so happy with the burrito that we ordered 3 tacos, and they were awesome as well. They don't skimp on the ingredients.  Completely unpretentious, flavor-focused, family run, affordable, and well located. They'll be seeing a lot more of my business. Check it out.  Burrito starts at $6.99, 3 tacos for $6.49 (I think)."}
{"text":"Best burrito I've had in Montreal. For $10 you can get a burrito which feels like a brick in your hand it's so heavy. They really load them up and they're unbelievable tasty. Try the pulled pork burrito, unreal."}
{"text":"So much flavor, and you can tell it's authentic and comes from the heart. I would eat there on a regular basis if my diet allowed it!!   Important tip: cash only! The first time I went with my credit card in hand and left my purse at my office... I was so disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and I had an amazing service! I love going there. I can say that this is really the best burritos place in Montreal, I also love their hibiscus juice."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. As someone who grew up eating Mexican food I would come back here when ever I come back to Montreal. I ordered a car not as burrito which in my opinion was way better then anything I ordered from Chipotle. The burrito had so much flavor. My only issue was that the beans could have been cooked a little longer."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best burrito's you can find! The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. Make sure you have cash when you go, they don't take cards, but if you need to there is an ATM. If you want to avoid the charge for taking money out of the ATM, there is TD bank and Scotiabank nearby"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Solid and tasty meal. Good price, really dig it. I suppose it's not the best, but it's not like we're close to the Mexican border to really complain. Staff is slow however, so make sure you got an hour blocked out when you go. Also there's a sound maker in the front to ring if nobody is in!"}
{"text":"All i have the say is I've been to california for an extended period of time, so i know a thing or two about a good burrito. Having said that, hands down there is no place in Montreal that can be remotely compared to the Burrito Shop in terms of the quality of the food, authenticity, and simply an overall good vibe.  The guaca is the shit!!"}
{"text":"Happened to stop in on our last day in Montreal. Had relatively low expectations based on appearance of the place. Boy was I glad to be wrong!  Nice simple but DELICIOUS food. I got steak tacos. Great seasonings. Wife got the burrito chimichanga. That was huge and tasty. Recommended for quick nice lunch. $20 for 2."}
{"text":"The burrito is flavourless and the ingredients are far from fresh. Thy have no choice in toppings and everything costs extra... Even the sprinkle of corn costs 75 cents. Worst burrito I've ever had. Don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"We visited this place to take home dinner for a lazy night.  The burrito was good - my boyfriend and I both got the spicy pork and it had a good kick, which was awesome!   The service was good, the gentleman behind the counter was really friendly and helpful, the only thing was he was there all by himself, so the process was a little slow because he had to help multiple people at once. It didn't bug us, we didn't have a schedule, but it might bug someone else."}
{"text":"Le bon et le moins bon se côtoient a de nombreux niveaux dans ce burrito joint de st laurent. La déco est bof genre graffitis d'ados sur des murs pas finis, ça manque d'ameublement et la lumière est tristoune. Par contre quand il s'agit de manger, un belle variété de viandes préparées selon des recettes authentiques, et de bons assaisonnements. J'ai bien aimé la possibilité de pouvoir prendre un coca-cola mexicain, je n'en avais jamais goûté. J'ai 2 bémols : le premier c'est que les quantités sont un peu frustres. J'aime bien faire mon repas avec 1 gros burrito. Pas grave, on n'est pas à Mission district. Deuxième bémol, beaucoup plus gênant : c'est que le porc dans mon burrito bien que délicieux était encore un peu rosé, et ça j'aime pas dans un fast food. Méfiez vous de ça...  Malgré tout, je crois pouvoir dire que ce sont les meilleurs burritos de Montréal, alors faites  votre expérience."}
{"text":"Friendly,  fast service. Had the slow cooked pork burrito.  Was good, a little dry. Ask for more sauce. Could have been more spicy. Over all a good, quick burrito. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Service: sketchy,.. I tried to redeem their check in promotion (a free fountain drink with a burrito) and the lady told me the promotion ended a year then 6 months ago?? Very sketchy and sounded like she just didn't wanna lose a free drink despite my phone clearly saying i just redeemed the offer. Just take the promotion down instead. The guy who made our burrito was fine, but the lady who seemed to run the place was rude and sketch.   The food was good, but pricy for the amount you get. I paid 10$ for a regular size burrito (not very filling) but it tasted good.   Overall Food: 8 Portions: 6 Service: 4"}
{"text":"Ouvert depuis 1 semaine sur St-Laurent, on vous prépare des burritos devant vous mais y'a encore place à amélioration concernant la décoration & l'ambiance. Le concept n'est pas aussi bien que M4 Burritos dans le Quartier Latin."}
{"text":"I've spent a lot of time eating burritos. I don't consider this the greatest, but I do rate it very highly.   I plumped for the chicken and a pretty tamely spiced option. It was made up fresh and cooked.   My friend heartily recommended the pork one too."}
{"text":"Staff is very informative and friendly. Victor I think is his name who made my burrito. Very kind and a great smile. Quick too, even working alone! Food was fresh and delicious and very filling for the price. 10/10 would recommend! They take interac now, too. Very convenient. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Best burritos I've had in Canada, for sure, and comparable if not better than things I've tasted in Austin, Texas and Los Angeles, and at $6.99 for a huge burrito, the value for the money is tremendous. I've been twice now and I think I prefer the barbacoa to the carnitas, but both are fantastic, as are the homemade tortilla chips. The homemade guacamole is so good that I suspect it should be illegal.  Forget M4 and stop lamenting the lack of Chipotle locations in Montreal; this place is in a completely different league."}
