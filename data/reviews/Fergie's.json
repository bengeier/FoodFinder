{"text":"Shelly is awesome! 

I am a gyro snob and LOVEEEEE their gyros. That sauce is amazing. Can't say anything more."}
{"text":"Best damn gyro... EVER ! They are the biggest sandwich you can imagine. The drinks are cheap, the beer is cold and the crowd is fun. You cant go wrong !"}
{"text":"The best gyro I've ever had!  Crispy meat and pita with creamy cucumber/yogurt sauce.  The original was too big to eat at one seating, but yummy as left overs!"}
{"text":"My favorite gyros in Cleveland. Cheap beer, usually crowded at the bar and most of the staff is super friendly. Tammy is a rock star. Other nights the staff can seem a little too serious but they mean business. Not many places can cook good food behind the bar, and almost no bartenders can wrap a gyro this good. Always get an extra sauce and feta."}
{"text":"Typical Parma bar.  People there drinking and smoking outside in the middle of the afternoon (not that im above that by any means)..lol.  They have gyros which are actually OK.  Bartenders are not the friendliest.  One time I walked down there to get a gyro with my old man and a lady WAY older than me proceeded to throw up in the bar.  They barely even batted an eye..they cleaned it up but let her stay in the bar.  Now thats Rock N Roll.."}
{"text":"Hello AMAZING Gyros!  1 whole pound of gyro meat!  Opa!"}
