{"text":"Best place downtown for a grab-and-go  lunch. Good selection, solid quality, excellent prices and great service."}
{"text":"My usual on Fridays, why? Because they have an amazing self serve Friday breakfast special.  Every friday, no fail. There are egg bennys, bacon, sausage, omletes, scrambled eggs, french toast and my favorite - waffles!!! It's always a nice way to kick off the weekend with a fun breakfast and for those that work downtown, it's a great location since it's hard to sneak away for a full fledge breakfast while you're working.

I enjoy topping my waffles with the many different selections of fresh fruit, a bit of whipped cream and a side of butter! They also serve a nice array of coffees or espresso drinks if you're not in the mood to wait for the Starbucks lineup down the way.

My only complaint is the layout of this place is hectic.  Their cash registers are all at the entrance along with their coffee station so people are all crowded around that area.  Makes it quite tough to get to the food that's situated at the back. I think they can definitely use a layout update, but until then I guess I'll just have to fight through the crowds to get my weekly breakfast special!"}
{"text":"I've given this place several chances to wow - I think it's a pass. My opinion of it is that it is a Marcello's \"wanna be\" - the prices are more expensive than Marcellos, the quality is never as good.  The coffee might be cheap but it is very watered down.  The salad bar at lunch is also dirty - literally.  The lettuce (romaine in particular) was not washed properly..if at all.  The roasted chicken is so greasy that you might as well eat KFC.  The breakfast portions are fair - but the line cook who makes the breakfast every morning is rude, not a lot of pride in what he does.  The breakfast buffet on Friday is also poorly done. The bacon is all stuck together and chewy.  If you want the same thing for a more reasonably price and better quality - skip Ollys and head to Marcello's instead.  I've given up on this place."}
{"text":"I'm from BC to visit a friend in Calgary and she brought me here for my breakfast. It was SO good!

Everyone was extremely friendly and there was so much variety that I had a really difficult time deciding what I wanted to eat!

I ended up getting a little of everything from the buffet to try it, and it was all delicious.
I couldn't finish it all before a few things started getting cold (which with a buffet is expected), but I had a great breakfast and I'd definitely come back every day if I didn't live so far away!"}
{"text":"I COME HERE EVERYDAY. I love this place. If you aren't feeling for the hot/cold buffet, there is other options. The soups (kale and lenti and Egyptian lentil) are AMAZING! They have everything for a good price. I love their sandwiches. 

I am forsure an Olly's gyal.

They also have all types of tea to choose from with the potion of adding honey, almond or soy milk for 1.25 or 1.50."}
{"text":"I've only bought the pre-made salads here, this is what my review is based on.

Good prices for the amount/quality.
Better value than Longo's in Brookfield Place (a similar and close alternative)."}
{"text":"Super tasty homemade soups, sandwiches and breakfast items at a great price!  You actually feel like you're eating a real meal instead of bland run of the mill takeout.  The owner/manager really seems to care about serving good food.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tall guy at grill counter coughed all over my wrap before handing it to me. No manager around to complain to."}
{"text":"Yummy and filling legume based soups with bread for $4.20 cents/large. This is my go-to lunch most days. The price and reasonably healthy ingredients (vegan! Beans and veggies! Not too salty!) justify not schlepping my lunch from home. Pro tip: ask for two buns (the buns are small) and they accommodate."}
{"text":"If you are someone who loves food and trying a bit of everything in one meal, this might be the place for you. I think this is a fantastic spot for lunch or a snack. Great selection, fair prices and despite being crazy packed at lunch, the lines move fast. 

I opted to have one of the take out boxes you fill at the salad/hot food bar. There were a lot of really interesting choices from roasted turkey in gravy to a meatball casserole to lime cilantro chicken. Everything was fresh, well cooked and tasty and was constantly being restocked. 

They had a range of salads from the traditional to some more unique \"ethnic\" types. You know how some buffet type end up sucking because everything on your plate tastes kind of the same? Not this place. Each dish I sampled had its own character and texture. Deeeee-lish.

Price wise I found it more than fair for downtown. I had a container with probably too much food, and a speciality juice for about $13. So without the drink I'd have come into under $10. There was plenty of seating in the food court area as well as grouping of chairs nearby. Some of the other competition around cannot boast that-just saying.

Now that I realize it isn't that far from me (on a nice day) I think I'll be checking it out again!"}
{"text":"John D was way too nice. The place is filthy and I was there when John D found a worm in his food. What was worse was there attitude to it. 
Its sick.I work in the building and pick up food here often! Its shocking that they allow such restaurants in operate in such a prime location."}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast place. Good selection, although the bacon was a little overdone, the potatoes were a bit tough, and the sausage was kind of salty. Still, I was hungry. 

Also they have raspberries and blackberries, so that's nice. And their fried eggs are beautiful!

Overall it's not bad and if you need some breakfast and feeling fancy try Olly Fresco's; kinda expensive and not really worth it, but it's great for getting a lot of different stuff. 

P.S. Oh yes their beans are decent. Although in retrospect they taste like Heinz beans. Still, I enjoyed them."}
{"text":"The self serve salad bar is expensive when compared to other lunch options nearby, $15 vs an average of $11-13 at the other locations. The food is good and perhaps the premium in price is worth it for the options"}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast a few times around 8am and its been great. My friends and I always go for the hot buffet where you fill as much as you want, weigh and pay. 

Usually, the items stay pretty consistent but the past 3 times I went, there were unique items every single time. Sometimes they have fritattas and omelettes. Sometimes there's french toast, pancakes etc. The consistent items include hard boiled eggs, fried eggs, hash browns, bagels/toast, fresh fruit (melon, pineapple, berries), cheese, bacon and sausage. 

I discovered a hack when I went there. The salad bar, beside the hot buffet is technically open in the morning so I load up my box with a bed of spinach, add some eggs on top, add some fruit on the side, sometimes french toast, hash browns and a slice of cheese. The total usually comes to around $5 - 6 which I think is a pretty good deal. If you don't go the salad route, it's very easy to get carried away and end up with a $10 bill. 

Food is fresh and tasty, great breakfast option when you're looking to indulge one day! They also have breakfast sandwiches, fresh packaged fruit, yogurt parfaits and coffee."}
{"text":"New grocery/deli that opened the first week of February. They seem to have a plethora of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free products and the folks I talked to seemed nice.

It's quite hard to sums though, the only way I know to find it is in the under tunnels that connect the Eaton centre and the Bay."}
{"text":"What can I tell you folks? 

We all know how's the food situation in food courts in general, especially those in the financial district. They all serving the same old items: unhealthy fast food choices for \"unhealthy\" prices (unhealthy for your wallet - steep prices mostly driven because it's prime rental).

Olly manages to have a vast menu that caters to a large variety of customers: \"eater like birds\" (just very tiny portions), to hungry people like there is no tomorrow, vegetarians, meat lovers, you name it.

On a regular basis Olly cooks tons of food that is offered with one of the following options:
- hot meal you pay by weight (I believe is $1.49/100gr: best deal out of all food by weight in the area;
- salad station: also can be purchased by weight;
- salad isle: you can buy ready to grab boxes;
- soup station: they usually have 6 different type of soups. Here I had the best chili con carne ever bought from a store;
- station for sandwiches that will be made on the spot (subs and shawarma);
- dairy product, drinks, sushi prepared and ready to grab in lunch boxes;
- station for coffee and sweets.

While going to a fast food chain you know what items you are going to have all the time because they NEVER change, here the food is cooked on site and everyday, about 60/65% of the menu changes so that people can always have different food and combination choices.
What's even more great about Olly, is they care about food going to be wasted.
So, to fight this common practice, every day, after 4pm, they allow customers to get as much food as they can fit in to a box for a flat fee of $9 from the hot meal station. Where else you can get a better deal than this?

The service is great and the quality of the food is astonishing. In my opinion, this place is second to none because it brings awesome food, variety and quality for a price that is hard to beat.

Also worth to be mentioned, that Olly offer breakfast items until 11am (time when the food for your lunch is brought out). 
The items are the usuals: scrambled eggs, sunny side up eggs, sausages, bacon, potatoes, fresh orange juice, muffins, etc.

Personally, I'm not a big fan of their breakfast. The bacon especially, unless you get there when it's ready for sale, is floating in its own fat which, in all honesty, not my thing.

If breakfast would be as awesome as their lunches, Olly would get to a 5 stars. Until then, sorry, only 4   : )"}
{"text":"I go to Olly's in Bow Valley just about every day. Some day's I frequent this place twice. My co-workers go to Olly's all the time. So I'd like to say we're experts on this fine establishment.

Every morning, I go over to Olly's for a coffee. I love that if you bring your own cup, it's only $1.25. They have about 15 different kinds of coffee. My favorite is the cherry chip swirl. It smells amazing and actually has good chocolate cherry taste. I've tried others but keep coming back to my fav.

Olly's reminds me of Sunterra but in my opinion, way better. They have a selection of pastries for breakfast and a special hot buffet with bacon, eggs bene, and other goodies every Friday. There's also a made to order omlette station. At lunch, they have both a salad bar and hot buffet. I could totally stuff my face at either. The menu changes all the time and you will see everything from perogies, dry pork ribs, sweet and sour chicken, pasta, green beans, you name it. The salads are really good, too. You can get prepackaged salads, fruit cups, sandwiches and a load of other things if you're in a hurry. Otherwise, they will make you a sandwich the way you want including falafels. These are pretty much as good as Chick Pea (which I think makes the best falafels in the city). The soup station has about 6 different kinds of soup every day. They also offer both meat and vegetarian chili. You can always sample the soup before you buy which is something I really think is cool. I could eat here every day and never get tired of the food. 

Olly's is hopping no matter what time you go, especially at lunch. However, they have lots of cash registers so you never feel like you're waiting long. I'm in and out of there in a few minutes. The staff here is probably the friendliest I've encountered anywhere. The girls are always smiling, ask you how you're doing, and it's a genuine pleasure to be served. To me, this is what makes Olly Fresco's stand out from all the crowd. I don't often give a place/service 5 stars, but Olly's deserves every one of them (more if I could give them more!)."}
{"text":"This place still does 4.74 wraps and sandwiches.

There's a couple others that cost a bit more, but for the most part the basic wraps haven't changed in price over the year, even with the increase in min wage at the beginning of the year.

I typically just get the chicken wrap for the most part since it comes with large chunks of chicken, lettuce, and cheese. I don't know I guess I just prefer to have chunky meat instead of sliced meat.

I heard there's a deal after 4 PM where the hot foods buffet is all-you-can-fill in a box for a flat rate, but I've never had the chance to check it out."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic. A wide and healthy selection. The breakfast buffet is amazing and so is their lunch menu. It's now my go-to spot for my lunch breaks and snacks. Best part, their packaged salads and warm meals may go as a 2-for-1 deal before closing."}
{"text":"Wed and Fri mornings are Breakfast buffet days here, and their hash browns are amazingly good.  They have green onions and spices added, kicks it up a notch.  The staff are friendly and the vibe is very casual but professional.  Buffet is by weight, and I got some eggs, hashbrowns, 1 piece bacon and one sausage for $5.  Very reasonable considering all you get.  Coffee is very good as well, so overall - I gave them 5 stars.  Much better than Marcellos in Suncor with the scary sad people and raw bacon."}
{"text":"I like this place. My only issue is with some of the cashiers. 

1- many times when I'm buying a few things they ask me if I want a bag. I know it seems harmless, but when they ask me I've got 5-6 items that include large items and I'm in the store with just a wallet. Use common sense.

2- I was being served by a cashier. In the middle of my service she stopped to take money from the person behind me for his coffee. Aren't you supposed to finish with me first before going to the next client?

3- they often make mistakes with prices so be careful. 

4- often the staff are too busy chatting and chat even if you're standing there waiting to pay. 

I think the staff just needs to be trained a little more in servicing clients. The other staff is great and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Go-to lunch place at work! The prices are reasonable and they offer a variety of lunch options here. The hot buffet has great healthy and meaty options. I love the guacamole and roast chicken at the hot bar. Shawarma is pretty on point as well and cheap. Soup is also good although I have only tried the chicken rice noodle. Lunch line ups are quite long but I can eat healthy here with the variety of choices!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to eat something healthy on the go. I will say that it is kinda contradictory because they offer candy bars and soda. But otherwise, everything else is very fresh and convenient."}
{"text":"I almost come here everyday for a quick 10 mins breakfast. You can select from a variety of sunny side up, sausage, scrambled eggs and fruits. 


Basically, you scoop it up yourself and they charge you by weight. Hence, depending on your appetite you can scoop as much or as little as you want and different variety. Some days if you are lucky they even serve smoked salmon.

For me, I usually eat two sunny side up and mashed avocado with corn on the side. It only comes down to $2.50.

I recommend this place for a quick fast food, low cost breakfast."}
{"text":"When I don't pack in my lunch, this is the place I prefer. First it is very close to where I work, secondly it is always quick in and out even during morning and afternoon lunch hour, the prices are very reasonable if you compare with others and the quantity and quality are also not bad, in fact better and I find it money's worth. And just like most restaurants downtown they mark clearly what is vegetarian and vegan. 

I have had quite a few soups here as they are my to go favourite meal. But yesterday, I hadn't had breakfast and also didn't carry anything so decided to O a try. 

Picked a large Oatmeal, which is quite reasonable sized. The container was 3/4 filled and a station is provided to fill the rest with mixed berries, nuts, brown sugar, seeds and some other choices. You can put in as much or as little you want. 

The breakfast was filling and the oats cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. For $4 including taxes, you could not go wrong. 

I have found a place to have breakfast now, just in case I have not had at home or carried with me!"}
{"text":"Love Olly's! Really convenient location and always a great selection of food. Always a great spot for a bagel on Friday and great selection of coffee !"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. If you have food allergies (gluten, egg, dairy... Etc) like myself everything is clearly labeled. Food is fresh, hot, and there is a large variety. It is often very very busy at lunch but they serve extremely quick. The prices are more then fair, and often fast food joints cost way more for the same amount of food or less. My favorite place to eat for lunch when I am down town."}
{"text":"This 'pay-by-the-pound' hip cafeteria buffet is actually a smart way to go. At roughly $19/kg if you portion correctly you get a meal without drink for around $10. That includes anything from the salad bar and got buffet. Just to give you an idea..my go to hot platter is the Butter chicken or sometimes Chicken Tikka and rice, after that I just add sides that look healthy or look like they just came out of the oven. That's the great thing about it, it's not one of those heat lamp sneeze guarded old school Ponderosa salad bars from the 80's, this is a revved up New York style, Get Outta My Way, 'What are You lookin' At' food stops. It's quick, but not nasty, and since there are so many people filling to go boxes, the result is  fresh hot food pretty much every time I go there. The only problem I have with it, is that it's killing the food court, I mean even the McDonald's line looks sad. What was once a mall treat, now turned into a walk by glance since Olly Fresco's is actually faster and a healthier option, depending on your food mood. Not sure what McDo's is going to do to compete? Maybe an All U Can eat ice cream Sundae bar, I mean go big or go home!"}
{"text":"I love Olly Fresco's!  It's a great change from Sunterra, and offers tons of healhy options.  I have yet to try the hot buffet or salad bar, but love their prepared sandwiches, wraps, salads and veggie trays.  You get a good portion for a reasonable price - even though it is busy at lunch, the lines move pretty quick."}
{"text":"Good breakfast/lunch spot for those working in and around Bow Valley Square. I tend to go for the prepared salads and sandwiches for a quick lunch.

Friday's breakfast buffet (pay by the weight) is also good with options such as bacon, poached eggs, and waffles."}
{"text":"This is my go-to soup recommendation because the soups taste good, the portions are perfect and the price is right. 

Everyone talks about the freestyle lunch here but what you really want to try at Olly's are the soups. For under $5.00 including tax, you can get a quality small soup with a whole wheat multi-grain bun. Chili is ~$4.50 and regular soup is ~$3.50. 

Recognizing that Soup Nutsy is usually the most popular choice, I find that it's quite pricey for a small at $7.35. Plus, I don't need the 2 sides that it comes with. McEwan's has a daily selection of 6 soups and it is ~$6.00 for a small which is pretty decent - I'd rank this as my 2nd choice. Skip Soup It Up and Picnic because they're usually quite bland."}
{"text":"For downtown lunch options, this is the best place I've had so far.

They have soups, sandwichs ($5.75), and salad bar (both hot and cold, by weight). I get the salad bar (usually fish, veggies, and salad) about 2-3 times a week, so that's what I'm recommending

Pros: Reasonably cheap for hot salad bar ($10/meal), healthy options, variety in food, large selection
Cons: I come here too much?"}
{"text":"Olly's has become part of my daily life these past few months as I walk past it every day on my way to work. And almost every day, it gets me wandering inside before I begin my day. I love the deli / buffet-type layout although it can be a bit overwhelming to begin with as there is so much variety spread out over quite a large space.

They serve a selection of hot and cold dishes, salads, sandwiches, wraps, pastries etc. Not to mention the variety of coffees and teas, a small size being under $1!
I am usually there around breakfast time and there are always people grabbing, what looks like, a delicious hot breakfast. I have not tried any of the hot food selection that they have as I usually prefer to grab and go but the self-serve buffet, filet mignon sandwich and pastas definitely look tempting.
I am always drawn to the pastry section to begin with and they have a great selection of croissants, muffins and more. They do this delicious big cookie made with oats and chocolate (or berries) which I have quickly become addicted to. I also love their strawberry and clementine salad with poppy-seed dressing - it is super fresh with quality ingredients... definitely my favourite salad there! 

The buffet/ hot food is usually finished around 4pm but sometimes around that time, a lot of the puddings, salads and sandwiches are 2 for 1 so you can grab yourself a bargain from the front fridges. 

I have taken off a star due to the service... There has been a few instances where I have found the cashiers / workers to be quite rude.
If you are looking for somewhere downtown to grab a quick breakfast or lunch, I highly recommend Olly's for this. It is conveniently located at Promenades Cathedral, not far from The Bay."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day after struggling to decide on what to eat with so little time. I walked around their hot lunch buffet and began deciding on what to get. Most of their options include, mashed potatoes, chicken fingers, chicken breasts/thighs, perogies, lasagna, meatballs, fries etc etc with many of their options being gluten free. I watched as all these business workers filled up their boxes with heavy items cringing at what they might be paying for mediocre food. I decided to get three chicken fingers and 3 overly large potato wedges..my total came up to $5.45. Pretty expensive for only three of each although Olly's knows who their consumers are and are smart in the fact that they only put out heavy foods in order to get their moneys worth back. The food was very mediocre..chicken fingers were very dry and the potato wedges lacked in flavour. I have had way better wedges at 711! 

Most recently I noticed their little candy section they have set up with little bins of sour keys, wine gums, peanuts and dried mango for $1.49. Not too bad of a deal considering the area. They also have a hot food station with sandwiches which I have not tried yet and varies yogurts, salads, brownies etc etc that are pre-made. 

This place is usually busy and I can see why they can seem appealing however I wouldn't come back here for food..go across to the food court and try your other options for a better price!"}
{"text":"I visited the Olly Fresco's franchise located downstairs from Simon's department store in the tunnel linking McGill and Peel Metro stations. I was interested in trying a new place that had a menu offering food that I could pick and choose according to my taste. They serve hot foods such as Chicken, Fish, Roast Beef, Rice, Pasta and Potatoes and Vegetables. The cold tables served salads. There were drinks (coffee, tea and sodas) and desserts as well. 

I chose a handful of French fries, two small baked potatoes, a Samosa, one piece of Roast Beef and two Chicken Wings for a total cost of $9.32. I almost choked when the cashier told me the cost of my meal.  Incredible! This meal was way overpriced for what I received and the food was utterly horrible and tasteless, probably the worst meal I have ever eaten in my life. My money would have been better spent on a trio at Mc Donalds, or better yet, a can of Chef Boyardee from the dollar store. The best thing about this meal was the recyclable box it came in. At least they got one thing right!"}

{"text":"I went to Olly Fresco's for lunch. It's crazy busy at noon just like any other path restaurant. The most attractive aspect of Olly Fresco's is the variety. The salad bar looked amazing but I was looking for something more portable so I opted for a wrap. You can choose several meats in your sandwich/wrap so it's a great option if you're looking for something filling. The wraps are placed on a foam tray and then wrapped which seems rather wasteful. The lines get very hectic which can be a little overwhelming, but the food was good."}
{"text":"you can get a large delicious (and healthy) lentil soup here for 4$. and they have several vegan options for to-go meals and snacks. My go-to snack place to satify my mid-morning/ post-lunch cravings!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Reminds me a lot of Marchè except with more variety. Staff is super friendly and food is really good. I usually get the steak and cheese sandwich. HUGE portion for less than $9!! Try this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been in this place many times, for breakfast and lunch and almost tried everything; they have buffet for breakfast and lunch, usually packed with people working in the area.
I can just say the selection of food is not bad, variety of food is there, and you will definitely find something you like in here; however, it is a bit pricy for what you are getting, an average buffet, not always the best in Quality. Coffee also is not the best you can get in the area."}
{"text":"A co-worker informed me of this place that offered spaghetti in meat sauce (bolognaise) for $5.50+taxes=$6.35 on Mondays and Tuesdays only.

I decided to take the plunge and try this place out.

Olly Fresco's is located in Les Promenades Cathedrale within Montreal's \"underground city\" and located at McGill metro. It is located at the end of the food court (or the beginning of the food court depending on how you enter) and looks like a combination of a small grocery store with food stations that you can order specific types of food (sandwiches, delicatessen, pasta). The items in the \"grocery store\" area were prepared salads, prepared sandwiches, yogurt, fruit juices, fruits, etc. Most of the items where \"healthy lunches\" but I did see some candy bars, chips, and soft drink there as well.

For the pasta, you basically stand in line at the pasta bar and when it is your turn, you order the pasta that you want and they prepare it in front of you.

In my case, I just wanted their spaghetti bolognaise so it was very fast. All they did was to take a pan, put the pre-made bolognaise sauce on it and put it over the hot stove. At the same time, they put the pre-cooked spaghetti/pasta into the boiling water for a few seconds to get it hot. They then removed it from the hot water and shook it within the colander to try to get as much water out as possible before putting it into the pan with the hot bolognaise sauce. He then pan-tossed/pan-flipped the pasta for a few seconds before pouring it into the plastic take-out bowl. The chef will ask if you want cheese on top. Being mildly lactose intolerant, I opt not to have the cheese. He then covers it and after you pay for it, you either walk to the food court to eat or you can take it back to your office.

I thought that it was above average for spaghetti bolognaise. It wasn't the best that I've had but it wasn't the worst either. Even though the bolognaise sauce was thick, when it was mixed with the still wet spaghetti, it wasn't as thick (and I prefer the sauce to be thicker). The sauce tasted very good. It wasn't sour and had plenty of meat. The portion size was also very large for the special $5.50+tax price tag. I believe that the regular price is $6.75+taxes.

They have more elaborate pasta dishes at the pasta bar section where you can specify if you want chicken, shrimp, onions, etc. with your pasta. The price of your pasta will depend on what you add to your pasta dish. They also had a variety of pasta sauces.

I returned to my office to eat it. With 2 glasses of water, I was full.

One of the things that I like about the location is that it is within the metro station complex so if you work in a building that is connected to the metros (like I do), in case of bad weather, you don't have to go outside.

I will definitely return. A great place to get spaghetti bolognaise at a special price (only Mondays and Tuesdays)."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a workday at the financial district.

Usually I tend to avoid buying food at those mini food marts because their large variety overwhelms me. However, I decided to try out Olly Fresco because they had the shortest lines.

I went for their buffet style, pay by weight section, where it allows you to pick whatever you want and pay by the quantity. The price was $1.89/100g and there was a salad bar and a hot foods bar for the same price.

I opted for the hot foods bar and picked one piece of fish fillet, roast beef, mixed veggies, and rice with some sauce with Indian spices. I wasn't feeling very hungry which is also why I picked to get food here, and it still cost me close to $7.

The food all tasted bland. The only thing remotely flavourful was the Indian sauce, which I essentially just used it as a dipping sauce. The mixed veggies were actually undercooked, that the brocoli felt very raw.

I'd still rather wait longer in line at fast food booths."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for both lunch and breakfast -- excellent value if you play your cards right and don't go overboard.

Breakfast options include the hot breakfast buffet -- pay by weight. They typically have a number of items out of the following: breakfast sausages, bacon, breakfast potatoes, hash browns, scrambled eggs, hardboiled eggs. omelettes, french toast or some other sweet item, assorted cheeses, and assorted fruit (usually melons or berries). You can also get a made-to-order breakfast in the form of a sandwich, bagel, or a standard traditional breakfast with eggs and whatever. I am usually here for an egg and cheese sandwich (on toast or bagel) -- runs $3.35 -- better deal than Bagel Stop or any other nearby place, pricier than Timmies but at least they cook a real egg properly here. They also have oatmeal which is a decent deal (around $3.80 if I remember correctly, and you top it off with your own choice of items). And then there are the standard continental breakfast items like muffins and other pastries, though the good ones tend to sell out before 9am. I am not sure how good the coffee is here, but they do sell it.

There is a plethora of options for lunch including a salad bar, hot table, falafel/shwarma place, deli/sandwich bar, and pre-made sandwiches and salads. Pre-made sushi boxes are offered (made by Bento Sushi), but I'd personally rather go to Sushi Shop instead for sushi. The hot table changes everyday though they are some staple items that are there pretty often, like the perogies. This keeps things fresh and varied. Be smart about what you load up with and you can come away with a decent lunch for less than $10. 

They typically manage to proces you fairly quickly though there are times when it does get pretty busy and the lineups are long (for the cash, shwarma/falafel, or hot table)."}
{"text":"Wish there was a 6 star option. They've got it all. Great selection. Very reasonable prices. And of course, very fresh, healthy and tasty food. Plus the management and staff are super-friendly and considerate of their customers' needs and wants. I love this place and go there for lunch at least three times a week. I also do a lot of my 'grocery' shopping there and frequently eat their prepared meals at night, too. This is the best food option to happen to Montreal in years. Go Olly!"}
{"text":"This place is in the tunnel (Bow Valley Square) and so every lunch time its crazy busy. Lots of people. They have the option of self serve by gram. $1.99 per gram for a tray of food or you can have it made by them. The place is popular.

The food itself is not bad and pretty good. I got the roast beef and it was pretty good not too dry. The herb chicken was slightly on the dry end but over all tasty. Herb and roasted potatoes was pretty good. The carbonaro was a bit bland. Perogies were good. 

Overall, I liked the food. Also this place has pretty good salad selections."}
{"text":"I don't normally come downtown on a weekday, so this place was really new to me. Dropped by this morning to order this delicious sausage, egg and cheese on a dark rye bagel freshly made on the flat top. Extremely convenient location to grab a quick breakfast in the morning. Located at the Royal Bank Plaza - only steps and a escalator away from Union station. It was bustling with people grabbing breakfast or snacks for their day, but the people who worked there seem pretty friendly and cheery even on a gloomy and rainy day."}
{"text":"I a very disappointed with the below review regarding food poisoning and worm in the food, which are the points of reviews. Information is power.
Could it be a case of you get what you pay for??


Olly Fresco's has the cheapest salad bar in the district. It is in the basement and further removed, but the salad bar is 20 cents/100g cheaper than Marcello's, which is 20 cents/100g cheaper than Longo's (which is $2/100g)! Fit For Life near King and University is also $1.50 (they call it $1.49) per 100 grams.
They have both an extensive hot and a cold buffet, sandwiches and other breakfast and grocery items.
They have a few organic food items and drinks for a prohibitive price as well.

However, everyone is in on the cheaper prices, so the wait is long in the queue and the place is chaotic. The cashiers work fairly briskly, but you will bump into someone or they will bump into you. The best idea is to avoid the peak lunch hour.
There is a seating area outside with some water which is nice, but the food court is in a basement and overall depressively ridden with fluorescent lighting.

Oh, someone at this place cannot spell in English. There is a section in the buffet whose title is 'caribbian.' Unless this is a brand new discovery or Olly Fresco's exclusive then perhaps they mean 'Caribbean'"}
{"text":"This place has tons of selection and is basically a larger version of Sunterra, except I think that it's a little less expensive. This place is packed if you come at noon, so I wouldn't recommend it. There are tons of healthy choices for lunch and lots of vegetarian and even vegan choices. This place is pretty great!"}
{"text":"Olly is good if you're in the area and you want a vast selection of different foods - pasta, salad, chinese, and so on - but it does get pretty expensive. 

It's a pay-by-weight place, which means that you'll end up paying $10-20 for a standard meal (depending on what you get - meat is obviously heavier) and there's no way to check until you get to the counter. 

I like the variety, but I really don't think it justifies the price - and this place gets SUPER busy at lunchtime so you don't always get any of the thing you want because there's none left. 

I'd give this place 3.5 if I could, because the food isn't AWFUL, it's just a bit like school lunch quality, if you know what I mean. Not bad, but not incredible."}
{"text":"Depuis l'ouverture de cette épicerie je suis sous le charme. Quelle merveilleuse idée qui me fait penser aux dépanneurs que l'on retrouve à NYC servant des options de repas avec des buffets ou l'on peut se servir et payer au poids. Comme toute bonne épicerie on peut acheter des produits de base : fruits, jus, lait mais cette épicerie s'est adaptée à la demande du centre commerciale proposant des plats complets pour la clientèle. Durant l'heure du midi, le Olly est très populaire et ce pour une raison les plats sont frais, bons et très abordables et je tiens à bien souligner très abordables. Ils proposent un grand choix de café près de la sortie et une multitudes de choix de thé également. Vous avez même l'option de commander des sandwichs et d'autres plats. J'ai pris leur quesadillas végératiens, juste trop bons!!!! Comme j'ai une dent sucrée j'ai été impressionnée par leur grand choix de desserts dans les frigos : des salades de fruits, des gâteaux au fromage et plein de petits cakes a 1.99$ plus taxes. Si vous faites un tour aux Cathédrales arrêt obligé !!! :)"}
{"text":"Great place.  Sandwich bar is excellent!    Buffet is a great lunch value.  Breakfast fantastic as well."}
{"text":"food is fresh and tasty. Great price for soup and salad. I had a Chowder and it was full of fish, crabmeat. Very good value and cheap."}
{"text":"Went there for a lunch freestyle where you grab what you want and they weigh the total and charge you based in that. Be careful or you could end up paying a fortune for lunch as a lot of what they offer tastes great. 

Only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is that it feels a bit unorganized. Perhaps it was because so many people were in there getting lunch (because the food is really good) but having to go all the way to the other end of the place to get a drink only to go back to the middle for the cashier is odd. 

Still, the food is amazing and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Olly's was pretty dern good. If you work or live in the area - this is the spot for lunch. 

They have pretty much everything you would want - vegetarian options, protein, cold dishes, sandwiches, salads, desserts, cookies, drinks...whatever you could want - they have! 

This is a self serve cafeteria style place in the metro-level of many office buildings above it. You can easily enter from promenade cathedral on st. Catherine street/Robert-Bourassa. 

They have many hot dishes, and the menu is changed everyday. Everything from chickpea curry to chicken tikka masala, to gnocchi, to mash potatoes, to potato salad....the list goes on. 

They also have a fresh pasta section where you can build your own pasta dish or get one of the pre-made ones. 

I opted for a big mix of everything - but you honestly can't go wrong - I had salmon, some tabuleh, mashed potatoes, chickpea curry, and gnocchi and everything was delicious! 

Hot and fresh....I'll definitely be back for more. You are charged based on weight of the meal - mine came to about $10 which is quite decent for lunch!"}
{"text":"Holy abundance of lunch choices Batman!  By chance I found myself in Promenades de la Cathedrale on my lunch break so I wandered into Olly Fresco's because it looked like an interesting lunch option and I'm glad I did because it was a good find.  This urban cafeteria has it all from hot meals to lighter, cold fare like salads.  

The space is huge and is split up into several sections.  There is a pasta bar, sandwich counter, grill, buffet and grab and go section.  The main thing that draws me to this place is that they have a good selection of healthy food.  The buffet contains items like lasagna, butter chicken, grilled vegetables.  If you are looking for something lighter then they have an excellent selection of salads and sandwiches.  Don't worry though they do have a sizable dessert selection in case you're in the mood for something not so healthy.  The food quality was also pretty good.  My steak quesadilla was pretty decent.  Sure it wasn't as tasty as what I would get if I were in a Mexican restaurant but it was just fine for lunch and it was a pretty sizable portion.  There was a fair bit of meat and vegetables in it.

The price is highly variable depending on what you order although on average you can expect it to be competitive with the downtown food court.  A steak quesadilla, soft drink and brownie came to about $12.  The hot meals will generally cost more and they do have more expensive drinks like mineral water so while you can have an affordable lunch it is also easy to get carried away with the cost.

The place gets very busy at lunch so expect it to be crowded if you go.  They certainly do their best to handle the crowds but given the volume of people you might experience a bit of a wait.  I also found that due to the layout of the store and the number of people it was hard to navigate through the crowds at times.  If you can try and take a later lunch to avoid the masses of people that descend on this place when noon hits."}
{"text":"After a bit of shopping I figured this was the ideal place to find snacks and prepared meals. I was here around 4:30pm and there were no hot buffet items left, rather the fridges at the entrance were full of 2 for 1 priced meals and people were scrambling around picking up arm fulls of stuff.
I guess around closing time they need to get rid of stuff so I picked up a tuna salad and egg salad, at just 2$ each, it's a great deal.
They also had microwable trays of food at 5$ a pop, tandoori chicken and rice, kafka lebanese style meals, meatloaf, roast beef, etc. 
Further in the back there are lots of deserts like cakes or puddings at 2$ a square, the portions are decent and I would say it's comparable to what you would find at the prepared stations at supermarkets for grab and go boxed meals. However the quality is superior. My salads were fresh and tasty, it feels homemade.

It's cheaper than eating at a food court and super convenient if you work in the area and want to buy your lunch.

Definately worth a look!"}
{"text":"Healthy snacks if you choose to avoid the unhealthy options lol
Great hot and cold buffet table
Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"This place is a Godsend. If you need to pick up lunch quickly and like having lots of options, between sandwiches, salads, salad bowls, hot lunches from a buffet-style station, a fresh pasta station, a sandwich station, desserts, cookies, small candy bars, all in one place than Olly Fresco's is for you.
It can get expensive especially at the salad bar or the hot lunch bar, because it's all sold by weight, but the pre-made sandwiches and salads are reasonable and the portions are filling. And besides the run-of the mill sandwich or salad offerings, you also get things like beef taco bowls, Thai Chicken salad bowls, chicken curry, lasagna, mac and cheese, mannicoti, just take your pick.
Also if you happen to come by after 5pm when they are really desperate to sell off their stuff before the 6pm closing, they sometimes offer a few items 2 for the price of 1, but this changes every day and they put these items out on a specific shelf near the front. 
My favorite is the Dutch egg potato salad, their Black Forest cake and Caprese salad."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on my way to the bus today to grab a quick bite. 

Saw that they were having a 50% special on their premade salad and fruit boxes and bought myself a mango quinoa salad and a potato salad. 

Both salad boxes looked relatively small but they were surprisingly filling. They were both very fresh and quite tasty :). I was a but worried at first about how much dressing there was on the potatoes but it was just the right amount of creamy and didn't leave me feeling like I was doing shots of mayo. 

I'm quite the happy camper - I'm full, I don't feel greasey (like I would normally feel after the usual mid-commute fast food) and I spent less than 3$!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan.

Way cheaper than loblaws, longos or sobeys for your lunch runs.  It's priced at $1.69/100g, has soups, deli sandwiches and even shawarma.  The only thing I did wish they had was longo's fresh pizza, cause those are pretty sweet.

But if you pick right, you can get away with a $7 (tax in) salad topped anyway you like.  Just be careful, don't pick heavy items and your salad's in the clear. =P

I'm here probably 3-4 times a week now."}
{"text":"If your stoked to fill up your dish, wait until 1:30 - less busy and they usually are bringing out fresh  food :)

Used to work here, and honestly from deciding on the menu to preparing the food this place is top notch. Not to mention FAST! With 4 stations waiting to ring you through, the line is never long. 

And a lot of people dont realize they also do breakfast! NOT JUST LUNCH BUFFET :) they make made-to-your-taste breakfast sandwiches with a ton of veggie options! YAY go vegeterians :)

Love this place."}
