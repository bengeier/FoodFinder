{"text":"I placed a take-out order on 7/19 at approximately 8:30PM. This included a Pomodoro Pizza with Sausage with a full size Caesar Salad. The pizza was very good, but the portion size of the salad was very small. This salad was supposed to be a Dinner size salad at a cost of $9. Does this salad seem like a good value at $9? The take-out container is on 1/3 full. I sent an email to the restaurant the following day but never received a response."}
{"text":"I love the bread there. The potions were huge. I would come here again! Very sophisticated atmosphere."}
{"text":"the best Italian restaurant ever in this area!  service is excellent! garlic rolls are superb!! will return at least every 2 weeks, since I live in Akron, Ohio"}
{"text":"I love going here for lunch.  Food is so fresh and tasty!  Dinner has never worked out well for us.  It's very cramped in the dining room when packed with the dinner crowd and the dishes are never ready at the same time...so at least one order sits under a heat lamp & dries out while the others are prepared. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here with my best friend and his parents for a celebratory dinner.  It's situated back from the road, in a little plaza, so be attentive!  I passed it up the first time I drove by.  The service was just alright, the waitress didn't seem that interested in serving us, but it was also around 7 pm on a weeknight.  Overall, she did an okay job.  She wasn't unfriendly, but it wasn't an over-the-top experience, either.  Didn't make or break our visit.  The dipping oil for the bread was amazing, apparently they are somewhat famous for it.  I could have been happy eating bread alone that night.  The Goat Cheese Trio appetizer was really good (an eggplant dish), and the Caprese salad was pretty standard -- it's hard to go wrong with that one, although the mozzarella and tomatoes were just a little wet.  I think I was the only one completely happy with my entree -- the shrimp and artichoke cappelini.  Both my best friend and his mom had to ask for extra sauce, and my friend's dad's lobster ravioli actually came with a lot more sauce than he preferred.    The dessert was the best part, probably.  I couldn't decide between the creme brulee or the peach gelato, so our server let me have both on the same plate (although I didn't end up paying, so I'm not really sure if she charged us for one dessert or two).  They were both pretty delicious, but if you have to pick one, go for the creme brulee.  I have yet to find a gelato here in Cleveland that tastes like gelato and not ice cream.  I'd probably go back if invited, but stick to what I've already ordered."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise, especially regarding the food.  Dipping oil was heavily amended w/ herbs, spices and cheese...and that can be good or bad.  But the chicken Marsala was tender and tasty, wine selection respectable, and atmosphere (patio) and service were pleasant.  Quality fare at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing after hearing great things from friends.  The good- garlic rolls and fried mozzarella. Pistachio gelato was great.   The bad- veal piccata was tough and overlooked.   The worst- service. Our server was non-attentive and barely spoke. We had to ask several times for things we wanted.   I'll try again, but never the veal."}
{"text":"Cafe Toscano is a little gem.  We have never been disappointed and usually are impressed with both the service and the food.  When our son was married last year, we took guests from Dallas, Chicago, and San Diego there and everyone was delighted with the food.  My son's new in-laws are vegetarians and the waitress and chef went out of their way to suggest cuisine for them.  Whether we order pizza for take out, stop in for a quick dinner or have a romantic Valentine dinner, this little restaurant serves up the most delicious, authentic dishes. Their food is not cheap, but nothing of such quality is."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect my first time dining here, but I am so glad I gave it a shot. I've seen their ads rave about their local ingredients, including their lettuce, and I have to say, that was a pretty nice looking, great tasting salad!  I'm craving another right now just thinking about it. We tried several appetizers, and all were delicious. My husband was in an odd eating mood and didn't really want a big fancy dinner, so he opted for the simple spaghetti & meatballs. Said it was the best spaghetti & meatballs he's ever had.  I had the sole, and it was crazy good!  Drinks were excellent, dessert was excellent.... And the service was best of all!  We sat outside in the courtyard because we had our dog with us. It was so much nicer than I expected. I could sit out there all day/night. It was romantic and relaxing. And the staff was super kind to our dog. They brought her a bowl of water and even gave her a generous snack. Even if the food wasn't amazing (which it is!), they'd win me over just for the way they treated my dog.  I will most definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Always friendly service. One of my families favorites. Not a lot of space make sure to have a reservation."}
{"text":"The most unfriendly place. No Hello or thank-you. Service was slow and our waitress never ask how was our dinner and my veal was over cook! Use Goupon and get a dirty look from the waitress, she put 20% tip on our check."}
{"text":"It was delicious. We had the fresh fried mozzarella, I never tasted something I already loved become my lust lol. Everything is fresh and we had appetizers to desert. I took my boyfriend out to dinner for his birthday and decided to go based off of these rates and reviews. The atmosphere is great for a date and you can see the chefs cooking. Also has a bar."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Had cavatelli and meatballs. But you have to be careful not to eat too many rolls, or you won't be able to eat your entree (hard to stop )."}
{"text":"Just left, came in at 8:30pm and all the cooks were eyeballing me even though they closed @ 10pm.  The guy in charge of bread didn't even bother cooking my bread until the waitress asked twice and my entree was coming out. All my food was RUSHED out of the kitchen, so some of it was either cooked ok or burnt. Their Signature Lobster Ravioli was rushed so fast my scallops and shrimp were \"cooked\" raw and the pasta for the ravioli was chewy.  The only reason why i give this place \"2 Stars\" is because my waitress was absolutely nice as could be.  I presume the head chef was there as he walked around to shut the store down.  The people in the kitchen could have cared less about how they cooked for their consumers and were mm ore worried about cleaning up and closing."}
{"text":"I found this place on the A-list on Cleveland.com. It's pretty close to home so we figured we'd give it a shot. The place was relatively slow for Friday night and the hostess tried to slam us in a small table for two right next to a huge group. Once I set her straight we had a really nice quiet table. Haha.   The atmosphere was great. Everything was clean and organized. The drinks were really good.   For an Italian place in Cleveland the food was just average. The mussels were plentiful but the sauce was just so-so. The caprese salad had very hard tomatoes and it was like they were rationing the mozzarella in the kitchen. Seriously I don't think we had 1/4 oz of mozzarella on the plate.   The fish special was delicious, however I think they tried to hide the lack of portion with a huge mound of angel hair.   Overall, this place was average. With so many places to go in the city, I probably won't be back for a while. The service was 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight and tried the Chicken Marsala again.   Very much improved from my one review with the Marsala sauce having a better flavor and didn't look and taste like plain chicken broth.  Not quite back to best Chicken Marsala but was very good."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing from the time we walked into the door...the staff, the food and the ambience were perfection! I highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there on 4-27-18 with my wife. Both ordered sandwiches- one veal the other chicken pesto. BOTH were terrible! Dry, tasteless and mostly bread. On top of the bad food - had to wait 30+ minutes for the sandwiches and we arrived before the noontime rush.  If you eat here for lunch, stick with the soup, salads and pasta dishes."}
{"text":"We were exhausted one night after a show at the IX center and decided to pop in and give this a pre-Valentine's Day try.  The hostess seemed a little shocked that we didn't have a reservation, but did accommodate us... probably due to the fact that the area was getting pounded with snow and she expected cancellations.  It is a very small restaurant so I think expecting reservations was more a necessity than trying to be snobby.    We got a decent table by the kitchen and immediately enjoyed the warm atmosphere.  Our waiter left a little to be desired, but the other waitstaff totally took over for him where needed; bringing us more bread or refilling our drinks.    The bread.  Oh my God, it is so delicious.  The olive oil with Parmesan blend is SO delicious, it makes my mouth water thinking about it.  The salad had some of the best house dressing ever.      I ordered the lobster ravioli a la vodka and it was great.  My husband's veal parmigiana was GIGANTIC.  We were both stuffed by the time the meal was over but still took a piece of tiramisu home and that was excellent.      The kitchen got behind while we were there and we definitely waited an absurd amount of time for our food, but they had several large tables and we could see them working and they were sweating their balls off.    This was an extremely expensive meal, but it was definitely delicious.  It is a great treat every now and then or a very nice place to take family or a client."}
{"text":"I really like the small space here. The bar is tucked into a corner, the kitchen dominates the back wall, and the couple dozen tables and wine  storage take up the rest. The rolls are soooooo good.. garlicky and dipped in olive oil and cheese. I love their wedding soup and Caesar salad. Most entrees are too big for one (in my opinion) and are perfect for sharing. Haven't had anything I didn't like at this place!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times and the food is amazing. Brought an Italian friend from Chicago and afterwards, he insisted that whenever he visits, we need to go here."}
{"text":"Love this place--i've had the lasagna, fettucini alfredo, my husband always gets the carbonara (and they have gluten free pasta) and the parm (eggplant, chicken or veal). All were very good. The service was awesome. Will return on a regular basis"}
{"text":"I visited this cuisine 3 times so far and I love everything about it. I'm new to the area but I can say it's one of the best restaurants if not the best around here.  Food was really delicious. The bread and olive oil dip (with extra cheese) is something heavenly. I'm so addicted! But don't eat a a lot of bread before the main course because the portion size is HUGE! You have been warned ha! Service is always great and they are attentive.   I would definitely come back more often and would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here for our 15th wedding anniversary. Very small but quaint. Had the Cajun fettuccine which was outstanding. My wife had the gnocchi which she could not stop raving about. The only negative was the zucchini app. Nothing special there. The service was good and food was timed perfectly. Oh yeah and I can't forget about the garlic rolls! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent authentic Italian food! I'm a first generation Italian and the food at Cafe Tuscano is the real deal! Have been there several times and the service was excellent. This place is the perfect little place for an excellent meal in a beautiful setting. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Really love this spot but it's a special occasion dinner for us.  they worked with my diet of non dairy and low salt. It's really small so get there early."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere !! Bar is cozy and sits a few people comfortably !! Wines and food selections are excellent !! People are very friendly and made sure we had a great time !! Will most definitely recommend this place !!   Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Servers are very attentive and friendly. Bread is delicious and salads are nice and colorful. (Some side salads just consist of iceberg lettuce and a cucumber) chicken Parmesan was baked like I've never seen and I attached a picture of it.  The breading very delicious as well as the sauce and cheese, but the  chicken itself didn't seem to have as much flavor as I  expected. It also just might've been the night as the chicken Tuscano that my family got did not have as much flavor either. I also was not a fan of the sauce that was on the spaghetti. My mom always gets the chicken piccata with extra capers and she highly recommends that. Try to sit outside if it's nice."}
{"text":"It's one of those places that makes you feel like they appreciate your business.   If it's not too busy in the kitchen they'll take off menu requests if they have the ingredients Really Swell!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute restaurant! The bread was soft, warm, and complimented nicely with an olive oil and cheese dipping sauce. The lunch menu was pretty reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food you receive. I got the chicken Parmesan and was not disappointed. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also very nice and would be pretty romantic at night I'm guessing. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Located in the corner of a small buildng along Aurora Road, this restuarant may not be glaringly obvious from the street, but once you taste the food, the quality and authenticity will not not be mistaken! The interior provides a calm, dimly lit ambiance, with white tablecloths and a  vast wine collection on full display display. The service is friendly and prompt, and the menu consists of soup, salad, pasta, chicken, seafood, and pizza. Each entree comes with fresh baked rolls and an olive oil tampendade, which is a heavenly compliment! I had a cup of minestrone and a plate of spaghetti pomodoro (tomato sauce), both of which were perfectly prepared and generously portioned! I would highly recommend a visit here!"}
{"text":"We dine here more than a few times a year. Always great service and the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good Italian food, but not the best Italian food. Nice atmosphere and good service. I'm sure I would be back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Came here to have dinner for my little guys birthday. It was my first time there so I didn't know what to expect going there with two Kids (under the age of 3) during dinner time. To My surprise they were very accommodating to our kids and were very kid friendly. Our waitress was very nice and very good with menu selections. I originally got Cajun Alfredo with tortellini but the two didn't mix so well and became very salty. I told our waitress and she suggested to get the original dish. She was right and it was delicious. Husband got the bolognese and it was very tasty and meaty. The portions are huge by the way so there was good amount for left overs. Our waitress also gave our little guy a free dessert with a candle and he was ecstatic. Good food good service! This will definitely be our go to Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp when I was leaving Aurora Farms was a little scared to try a new place but. But it was definitely worth it it was soooooo good I have two toddlers and a really picky husband but it was a hit my boys loved the cheesy bread n fried mozzarella I got the lobster ravioli n loved it definitely would go again"}
{"text":"Had a little bit of a rough experience last night. The service, while friendly, was choppy. For example, we had appetizers and salad prior to the entree, but the plates stayed on the table until the entrees arrived. The grilled Romain salad with heirloom tomatoes was a quarter head of Romain with a tomato slice that was a little grainy and had really no characteristic of an heirloom tomato.   The biggest disappointment, the linguini with white clams. I guess the price point is very good, but when I get this dish, I'm expecting the clams to all be from the shell. Supplementing with canned clams is just a little disappointing. Just to be clear, it was seasoned and prepared well, but I'd prefer to pay more for 100% clams out of the shell.    The garlic bread balls are just impossible to resist. Crispy, chewy, and just a guilty pleasure. I want some now."}
{"text":"Cafe Toscano is officially on the list of places that I will be going at least once a year.  Out of all the Italian places we have been in the Cleveland area from Little Italy to Giovanni's in Beachwood, Cafe Toscano is in the conversation for best Italian food in Cleveland.  We tried the crusted Arancini appetizer which was really great.  It was like a ball of rice and mozzarella cheese breaded, fried, and topped with a Pomodoro sauce and more cheese shavings.  I am not doing the description much justice.  Be warned though, it is a heavy appetizer that could leave you full before you order the main dish.  That also reminds me. Toscano isn't for diners in a hurry, which is great.  They were in no rush to take our entree order, preferring to give us our drinks, get the appetizers ordered and take our time eating those before delivering the soup (me) and salad (wife.)  The pace of the meal was just right between the courses.  For the main course, I decided to keep it simple after the heavy appetizer. I got their spaghetti and handmade meatballs.  The pasta tasted really really fresh, the sauce was good, and the meatball was really good.  My wife had the lobster ravioli served alla vodka with shrimp and scallops.  I don't do seafood, but it all looked great.  The vodka was thick and full of spices.  We didn't stay for dessert on this visit, but I am sure we will sometime in the future.    Anyway, I give this place a rave review.  The service was great.  The atmosphere was great.  The buildout of this restaurant with the dark woods and stone walls is classy and modern.  If I had one small complaint it is that this place was a bit loud.  Then again, it was really busy on a Thursday night, so that says something positive anyway.    Above all, the food was great.  It tasted really really fresh, and despite my ordering the most boring dish on their menu (which was still tasty,) they have a lot of very inspired dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a snowy Tuesday night.  The dining room was attractive and warm.  Service was engaging.  An assortment of warm bread with olive oil dipper began the meal.  All three of us ordered something different.  All were pleased.  The Cajun pasta was reported to be pleasantly spicy, but not particularly hot.  The waiter advised that the spice level could be increased by opting for the blackened chicken rather than grilled.  I had the capellini with shrimp and artichokes.  It was yummy at the time and re-heated well the next day.  Portions are HUGE so good reheating is a major plus.  Will return."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Cafe Toscano. I have to say, I was extremely impressed! Be warned, the portions are HUGE so sharing is completely an option. The bread and dipping sauce was delicious and flavorful, and each entree comes with a salad as well. I had the chicken Parmesan, which was as good as it was large and the restaurant was flexible enough to allow me to order penne with Alfredo sauce as my side. The service was great, the food was tasty, and we will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Magnifico! Cafe Toscano is a true, food-made-from-scratch, non-chain, locally-owned Italian restaurant at the heart of Aurora. Who knew? I love the food here that is obviously made with care and it simply tastes better. Places like this are the death of Olive Garden. I particularly love the clams linguine. They have happy hour, more than ample parking and a patio that is open in the summer. Sometimes, I call in for take out."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service! We sat at the bar.  Meatballs and stuffed peppers are AMAZING!  Bar specials for happy hour are lovely.  Recommend way over Mad Jacks (which we ate at yesterday)."}
{"text":"We have driven past this location multiple times and finally decided to make a reservation. With that being said, reservations are a must especially on a Friday night. This location has an intimate setting with roughly 12-15 tables and we noticed many of the people dining in were repeat customers that knew most of the staff. They do have a kids menu which is on part of the adult menu, 4 items ranging from $7-9. Adult portions are very hearty, I got the picatta and my wife the marsala, with these you get an angel hair pasta but for a \"small up charge\" you could add anytime of pasta and she highlighted the lobster ravioli...decent but not worth the $12 \"small up charge fee\" Would we be back? Maybe...but it would be without the kids for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. I am a vegetarian and though the menu shown doesnt have too many options, they can whip something for you exactly the way you want and it is yummy. I've had the minestrone soup (Good/Filling) and the Spaghetti in Vodka sauce (Amazing) but ofcourse, the most famous thing here is the fresh bread basket. Most amazing. Very good large portions of food too !"}
{"text":"Great service and food. I had the lobster ravioli, this is a must try. My husband had the chicken marsala it was good as well. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants. Service is wonderful, atmosphere rocks, and the food is criminally good.   Try the chicken Marsala. It's almost a sexual experience."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have dined at this cozy little Italian restaurant several times. Every time we're greeted by friendly staff that always remembers us. Nothing makes you feel more comfortable at a restaurant than being recognized, even after its been a few months.  It's a very small but elegant restaurant that's atmosphere is always on key. There is a great menu selection full of true authentic Italian dishes. Few of my personal favorites are a Goat Cheese Trio appetizer, Mozzarella Caprese salad and Gnochette Al Toscano.  Chefs are willing to make changes to a dish, and you don't feel frowned upon for doing so. Try not to fill up on the bread selection serves with a herb and Parmesan cheese Olive oil, because it is addictive."}
{"text":"Yet another nice place to eat in Aurora.  Cozy dining room, with seasonal outdoor seating.  Friendly service.  Nice menu with classic items and seasonal specials.  Good wine list.  I can see this place could get really crowded really quickly, but we visited on a relatively slow Friday night.  Worth going to for a good Italian dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian dinner in Aurora. Very warm and comfortable environment. Excellent food. Great portions and excellent service. The bolognese was fantastic. The meatballs, Mozzarella marinara and zucchini apps all great. Very nice wine as well. Highly recommend a stop here."}
{"text":"Great bread and olive oil - salad are fresh and very large! Great place for small groups or intimate dinners! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Nice location. Not many tables inside. Smaller Bar area. Nice patio. Ample parking.  We went on a Monday evening in the summer. Perfect evening on the patio.    Our server was perfect, and I don't say that often!  The food was very good!!   The water was good. I say this because sometimes water does not taste good!  Prosecco was good. The bread and dip - amazing! Addictive!!! Easily the best I ever had! The meatballs were good. The sauce is slightly different then I've ever had, but in a good pleasing way. The homemade raviolis were very good. Chicken Parmesan was very good. Pasta arabiata  was very good. Get the extra sausage/pepper/onion- excellent with perfect spice.  We will definitely be back!  Came back and had the special of a steak w/asparagus and scallop potatoes which was delicious.  Also the chicken Tuscano with the lemon sauce, also delicious!  Ordered their mozzarella stix and make sure to ask for some pesto with them too!!!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am a bread baker at home. sourdough, bagels, pretzels, brioche, etc. I'm also not a big pasta fan. I found this restaurant through the Yelp app in my Lexus. I say that because the app does NOT provide the details of the phone or web. The reviews looked good from what I could see in the car so we went. We were NOT disappointed! We shared the calamari appetizer. Crispy fried tender and delicious! And enough for a meal for both of us. We took home about half. My wife ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and I ordered the Lasagna. My wife's dish was HUGE and delicious but the standout for me was the lasagna. Also a large portion. It was so rich and creamy with cheeses. Layers of flavor. One of the best lasagnas I have ever had and I'm old! We both ate about half and will enjoy the leftovers for dinner tonight. The only miss here was the bread, but read my disclaimer at the top. I'm VERY picky about bread. It was not bad, but I doubt it's made there. It was just good. Sorry! I did eat it because bread is bread and I can't live without bread. Anthony, the server was quite attentive and advised us that if you go on a weekend or closer to dinner time any day (we were there at 4:15pm) reservations are a must as the place is small. I made a point to tell the chef how good the lasagna was. I will definitely go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with Family on a Friday evening around 730pm. The place is very small, and the restaurant was completely full. Although we had no reservation, we were still seating in about 10 minutes as the workers were very diligent on flipping tables. The bread and oil was fantastic, as was the Moscato. I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it was good- not something I would specifically crave again, but I wasn't disappointed. I will definitely try this restart again, and try a different meal to see if playing it safe the first time was why I didn't get an awesome dish."}
{"text":"Excellent. The fried zucchini is extra brilliant. Everything we tried was made with care & skill. The staff was attentive & complimented the kitchen staffs efforts really well. Wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Cafe Toscano is one of my favorite local restaurants and my boyfriend and I make it a point to visit at least once every two weeks. We are a huge fan of the food and the atmosphere and have gotten to know all the waiters and waitresses extremely well.  It's a small restaurant so it's a good idea to have a reservation even if you think it's going to be a slow night - don't show up too close to closing time because you'll likely be the only ones left!  The food is absolutely amazing - the bread and house salad are amazing and I am dying to get a hold of the recipe for that to-die-for balsamic vinaigrette.  We've tried all the pasta dishes and almost all of the appetizers - the crab cakes are divine as well as the calamari. Definitely try the meatballs and if you love gnocchi there's is very original and quite good.   I recommend their desserts as well - the chocolate and strawberry/raspberry cakes are amazing. A must try!   HUGE portion sizes at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Wow what a surprise this place was. If you don't mind spending a few extra dollars for exceptional service and phenomenal food this is the place to go. Lobster ravioli was out of this world and the Vodka cream sauce could have been a soup. The veal piccata was something to write home about. If you are around town it is a must stop for a great date night. Be sure to call ahead for reservations if you want to sit inside."}
{"text":"Amazing place every time. Incredible rolls you could make a meal off of. Over the top Cajun crepe fettuccini. Great cucumber basil gimlet. Great Caesar, too."}
{"text":"-1 Star for not having everything on the appetizer menu available. But let's not get hung up on minor details.   This is the best Italian food we've had in Ohio to-date. Given our standards are from living in Sicily, it's hard to impress. This impressed. A lot.   Everything always huge portions, excellent taste, and immaculate service. Their take on the olive oil and bread was quite well done.   We hit just at the last of the lunch menu, but we'll be back for the dinner menu some other time. And hope for those appetizers we missed this time.   All in all, totally worth the drive and worth the time to sit and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I came here with the wife on a Friday night. We were in the mood for some Italian, and Cafe Toscano hit the spot.   Setting was very intimate and romantic. The restaurant itself is in a small building and you can see the cooks in the kitchen. The staff were very attentive and nice. They also have a good selection of wines and have a full bar.  As for the food, I am vegetarian so my experience does not include meat dishes. That being said, the food was exceptional. We ordered Zucchini Fritte (panko breaded deep fried zucchini), minestrone soup, penne pasta with Cajun cream sauce, and eggplant parmagiano, all washed down with some proseco. All the dishes tasted fresh and you can tell that they do not use frozen vegetables or noodles. On fact, I'm pretty positive that they make the noodles fresh in-house. Also their bread appetizer with garlic olive oil dip is fantastic.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love Cafe Toscano! It is our go-to for date night! The bread and dipping oil is phenomenal and always get the Lobster Ravioli!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a nondescript building in Aurora. The dining room is small but they do have outdoor seating. The menu is Italian, they have the usual old world favorites as well as some new refresher items. There is a small bar with a TV.  The gnocchi dinner I had was good however it was kind of heavy. The portion size was huge, definitely enough for leftovers the next day."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie -- I mainly go here for the bread (if you go at an off-time, it will be fresh out of the oven and soooo lovely) and cheesy olive oil (mmmmmm) combined with the nice wine list. Each time I go, I order a dish to justify eating all their bread -- I have had a pizza, the caprese salad, and the goat cheese trio -- but I wouldn't order any of those things again. I'll keep trying, though, because the bread haunts me, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Second time here, this time for lunch. We were met with some fresh rolls and oil, cheese herb dip. always a good start for me. We ordered a chicken parm panini and the cob salad. The chicken parm sandwich was good, however the fries were not so good. \"Shoe-string\" ala Mc Donalds and they were cold. The Tuscan Cobb salad was amazing, however the 10 ingredients in the salad were in their own partition. In a bowl that hardly fits the huge salad made tossing it an impossible task. That being said this salad was a quality salad well presented, Had dinner here last time and was a much better experience. We will return."}
{"text":"Now this Is what I'm talking about excellent service great fresh food love coming back to this place again and again."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place for special occasions. However, over the years the overall taste of the eggplant & goat cheese appetizer just isn't worth the 40 minute drive anymore. The breading was flavorless & the goat cheese wasn't as tangy as it used to be.   Yet the polite customer service & the delicious garlic & cheese biscuits made up for it. And, as always the atmosphere was warm & intimate."}
{"text":"Manager did not honor restaurant.com certificate.  Excellent bread, that was the best part, chicken parm was okay.  Will not return and don't recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place. Small and intimate. Sat outside in a small courtyard. Food was good. The pizza has a thick buttery crust, similar to a pan style crust. Garlic bread was also good. Only negative here was the very slow service. Drinks, order, food, bill and pick-up of payment was extremely slow. The server didn't acknowledge her neglect of our table. Maybe this was due to sitting outside, although several others were outside too, but was still disappointing."}
{"text":"The 5 stars could easily be a fuel gauge on how full I am after eating here, then taking leftovers home, then eating again.  The food is ridiculously good, and the portions are ridiculous in an understated \"hey enjoy, I put 3 meals on your plate\" kind of way."}
{"text":"Wasn't hard to find with GPS.  Looks like it's going to be an old strip mall place from the outside, but once you walk in it is transformed into a nice romantic Italian restaurant.  Dark and quite, but not too dark to read the menu or see what you're eating.  Well, mostly quite.  One child under 2 who wasn't happy for more than 30 seconds at a time. Three different types of fresh bread puffs with oil and spices, seasoned just right were come with every meal. Ordered the three cheese ravioli.  It came out at just the right time, and looked great.  Now when the server asked me if I wanted extra cheese and/or sauce; I was suitably impressed.  Normally I have to ask at restaurants.  Tasted great.  I was hoping to take half of it home, but it was so good it was all gone before I new it.  Hope I didn't look like Garfield devouring lasagna... And some guy is setting up to deliver some live music; and here I'm getting ready to leave as soon as the rain let's up - rats."}
{"text":"An excellent Italian bistro. We have been there many many times over the years and have never been disappointed. All of the menu is fantastic and great wine selection"}
{"text":"Excellent! The portion sizes were VERY good, we had plenty to take home! Our server was Matt, very friendly and very well paced (we were neither rushed nor forgotten). Food was delicious! I especially liked the red sauce on the cavatelli, it had a nice sweet flavor. I don't live too close, but I will definitely make the trip to return!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner and we had reservations on a Saturday night. It's a good thing we had reservations because otherwise we would've been seated right by the door. It is a pretty small restaurant nonetheless. The atmosphere was nice and romantic. The server  was nice and we were greeted promptly when we sat down.       It went downhill from there though. My wine glass was literally only filled a quarter of the way to the top. I actually looked around at other people to see if there are wineglass that were filled only a quarter of the way and I think mine was probably the only one. I don't even drink that often and I was like huh? Are they that cheap? Anyways, We had the goat cheese trio for an appetizer. It was okay, but it wasn't anything spectacular. My husband had the lasagna and I had the chicken Toscano for our entrees. My husband liked the lasagna, but I thought it was just average. My chicken dish was a little too tart and was nothing out of the ordinary. I think I could've made this at home myself.  I would rate Vaccaro's trattoria as much better than this place. Although it  seems to have good reviews, I don't agree with them. I would actually rate the chain Bravo at Summit mall better than this place.       I really wanted to like this place because it seemed. like people were waiting to be seated and I thought it was gonna be really good, but it just was nothing out of the ordinary for Italian food. It was completely average and did nothing for me at all. I would not waste your money here if you have another favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Had dinner earlier this evening with my girlfriend and had a great time.  Perfect place for a cozy and intimate dinner.    I ordered the calamari friti for an appetizer.  Calamari was cooked perfectly, but the batter was a little more salty than I would have preferred... but the plate was clean when I was finished.  My GF got the sausage stuffed cuban peppers.  Enjoyed the dish, peppers were not as hot as they have been in the past, but still a great appetizer.    Dinner:  I ordered the Lobster Ravioli With Scallops & Shrimp.  Vodka sauce was rich with flavor that went well with the very plentiful raviolis,  shrimp & scallops.  GF ordered Chicken Alfredo with fettuccine.  Dish required a little salt to enhance the sauce, but more than a generous portion of pasta and chicken.   Our server was very attentive, but on the quiet side.  Overall, great experience again, as we have dined there numerous times in the past and will be back again soon."}
