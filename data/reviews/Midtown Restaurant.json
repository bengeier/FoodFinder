{"text":"This restaurant is excellent! As a New Yorker visiting my family in Toronto, there were 6 of us and everybody enjoyed their meal and particularly the warm and gracious service! The owner Richard makes you feel at home. 

Dishes to recommend are: filet mignon, grilled salmon, fish and chips, and steak salad! Love the generous portions and prices are very reasonable! If you're in the mood for the carrot cake, go for it! It's delicious!

I can't wait to come back to this restaurant next time I'm in the area!"}

SUMMARY: I'm sorry for the long review but I really need to rant because I do not like this place at all. 

Here is a summary of what I basically wrote down below. I order a Filet Mignon salad, did not get filet mignon, instead we got some kind of cheap chewy steak, but they didn't tell us about the switch in meats, and they expected to get away with it because they thought we couldn't tell the difference between a filet mignon and a cheap steak. Burgers were very soggy and the fries tasted like nasty old grease that was used over and over again. Also the owners asked Yelp to remove review, Yelp removed it for not following Terms of Service, I read the terms of service over and found nothing violating it and Yelp put the review back up and sent me the claim that the restaurant owners used to try and take down my review. Imagine what you could get away with if you remove all the bad reviews just by contacting Yelp




On the menu was a Filet Mignon, but what we got was lettuce and cuts of beef that were definitely not Filet mignon. It seems like they tried to give us cheaper cuts of beef just so they can get more money when we paid for Filet mignon.  The salad was made up of lettuce that made it look like the chefs ran out of lettuce for the salad and just pulled some off of a burger. The lettuce was all just big leaves that weren't even cut for a salad, they just pulled it off a burger. The beef that was supposed to be Filet Mignon was also incredibly chewy.

Also, the burgers are terrible. Normally when I go to a restaurant that I am unsure of, I just order the hardest thing to mess up, yet they still messed up the burger. They gave us a soggy patty and soggy lettuce and this caused the bun to be turned into mush in a couple minutes. The bun disappeared, so I was just left with a patty, lettuce, onion, bacon and cheese. Also did I mention that the lettuce from the burger was the exact same from the salad? Not to mention the fries were terrible. I love french fries, which is why I never eat it with ketchup, but you can tell if I hate your french fries if I have to douse it in ketchup. The french fries were so disgusting because the aftertaste tasting like they haven't changed the oil for frying in a week.

In short, I will never go here again, because they can't make a simple burger and they tried to scam us by advertising the meat as Filet Mignon, and giving us something different.


Also I don't know what happened, but the food mentioned in the other reviews were no where to be found here. The fish and chips and Sandwich and beef dip weren't on the menu when we went.

UPDATE: Turns out my review was removed for violating the Terms of Service. I found this to be weird as nothing in my review violated it. I contacted Yelp and they said that there was no violation so they put my review back up. Yelp told me the reason it was removed was because the business owner complained about the review so it was removed. I found this very sneaky and now there is another reason not to visit this restaurant. They complained saying I made false claims and that they shouldn't be called scammers, but I think the fact they used a cheaper piece of meat instead of a filet mignon, and not telling us about it should be considered a scam"}
{"text":"We went when the ice storm had hit Toronto around Christmas time. They were open and very welcoming. It was one of our only hot meals in the week we were without power. 

Service could have been better as we were one two sets of people in there. Over all the food was good and the prices were decent. 

We will return over the next little while to try their burgers they have on the front board."}
