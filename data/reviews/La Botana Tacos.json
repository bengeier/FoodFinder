{"text":"I will not be going there anytime soon. When I go to a Mexican restaurant for dinner I do not expect to order and then go seat myself. I expect to sit down have my chips and salsa and Margarita or a beer or whatever I wish... someone to wait on me. I hope they make it but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, Underspiced. The hubs wanted Mexican food so we decided to try the new Mexican restaurant in Fountain Hills, La Botano.  Location is good, nice view of fountain out on the patio.  Decent vibe when you walk in, large salsa bar.  We had a choice of ordering at the counter and having the food delivered to the table or sitting at the bar and ordering off the menu.  Since the weather was nice, we decided to sit outside and ordered at the counter.  When she gave us our total, we both were a bit surprised--nearly $50 for the two of us for lunch, but we reserved our judgement until we tasted the food.   We ordered tacos, chile verde pulled pork carnitas and carne asada.  Both came with rice and pinto beans.  All very bland.  The meat in the tacos had no distinguishable flavor, the rice tasted like plain white rice, and the pinto beans had no extra seasonings.  We also ordered the guacamole, which was good, but nothing special for $$.  The Grande Margarita looked like dirty water and didn't taste much better.  When I asked about their \"2 for 1 Grande Margaritas All Day Everyday\" special, which is prominently displayed on their website, I was told that it was only available Mon-Fri.  I didn't push it because I honestly don't think that I could have stomached another glass.  We have no issue paying $50 for an outstanding lunch, but our experience here was nowhere near outstanding.  There are too many other good Mexican restaurants in the area.  We won't be returning to La Botano."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot of potential.   It was a little complicated to get ordered.  You walk up to a counter to order and the choices are somewhat overwhelming.  It had the feel of a sit down restaurant but you serve yourself drinks and salsa.   The salsa is all really good.  They have multiple red and green salsas and an avocado cucumber.    I especially liked the roasted pablano salsa. The bacon wrapped peppers were tasty.  I had the grilled shrimp salad and it was excellent.  It had almost a baja  sauce on it.   My dad's grilled burrito was also exceptional.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We are AZ locals so when my husband suggested Mexican after a day of walking around the arts festival- I wasn't expecting anything special. Well I was surprised by La Botana and that's why we are reviewing them. Great customer service! One nice woman (possibly asian/native american) was off shift and she came to bring us more chips! Great food! The shrimp tacos #7 was so dang good! ALL the salsas were yummy! 5/5 and we will be back again when we come in a few weeks to the Pakistani Kite Festival! Thanks to everyone at La Botana for a great lunch experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Walk up and order. If your new, I'd recommend you look at the menu online before going. Great service. Kind of like fast food Mexican with better full restaurant quality. I'd go again. Mainly for the salsa and BOGO margarita which amounts to 42 oz. Also bring a DD."}
{"text":"Best taco place near Scottsdale/Rio Verde!! Their carne azada tacos are delish! Not to mention their salsa bar ! And their margs are worth every penny, gets the job done!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time on Tuesday and I LOVE it here. Everything we had was amazing and fresh, the salsa's were all unique and really tasty. I can't wait to go back!  I ordered the nachos and they were huge...my husband had to help me finish them lol. They weren't your average nachos, they have all kinds of grilled peppers, onions and mushrooms (had to pick off the mushrooms since Im allergic, but no biggy...I've just never seen them on nachos before). It wasn't nasty pump/nacho cheese, actual shredded and melted cheese.   My husband took advantage of their Tuesday taco special and the 3 varieties he got (6 tacos in total) were amazing, but my favorite was the chicharron and carnitas...I'm a bad bad Jew but I can't help myself...amazingness.    All in all we left completely stuffed and dinner only cost us about $22? For 6 well sized tacos and huge freaking nachos...no complaints at all and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in this location and so far one of the best Mexican restaurants in town.  El Encanto is still my favorite, but if you're in or near the Park and want a great meal at a reasonable price, you've got to check this place out."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. The meat was sub par and having to order food at the counter was something that I don't appreciate when dining out. Margaritas were weak. Not going back."}
{"text":"Nice new taco joint in our small town. The salsa bar is a nice touch. It's a bit confusing when you first come in to understand the layout and how to proceed. Chicken nachos are fabulous, burritos are ok. The churros for desert are a nice treat as well. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Servers FANTASTIC!! Greeted with a super friendly host who took our order which would later be brought to our table out on the patio. Food.. it kills me to type.. left me with a sour stomach. I had the stuffed peppers which tasted delicious but the sickness after was something I would still like to forget. The others in our party enjoyed their food with very little complaint."}
{"text":"I think a more appropriate review would be 3.5 stars but tbqh I'm not sure if there's a half star feature on here (somebody hmu if you can help a sister out).   Overall I had a very pleasant experience at La Botana. It's different from other Mexican restaurants in Fountain Hills so a change of pace is always a plus. They have a salsa bar which is awesome and all the salsas are delish. You order up front, receive a number, and then there are staff members around who bus/serve (kind of like a Wildflower/Panera kind of service). The food was very good and it's also supes vegetarian friendly.   The reason La Botana doesn't get five stars from me is because the service is very slow but frankly I think it has less to do with the servers themselves and more to do with the fact that there aren't enough of them. Seemed like they needed more people - I think I spotted a total of 4 and only one bartender on a very busy Saturday afternoon. It's right across from the park (sit on the patio if you can!) so it's going to be hoppin' on the weekends.  I will be back and will gladly update to five stars if we could beef up the service a little bit, otherwise I give La Botana a solid thumbs up."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a month or so ago with my husband and in-laws and it was AWESOME! We got an awesome deal on 4 giant-sized drinks and some out-of-this world tacos. They are still fairly new in town, but by far one of the best places to eat in Fountain Hills. You will not regret eating here!!"}
{"text":"This place is doomed to fail - not that's what we want in this small town.  You walk in and like McDonalds you first order your food and drinks.  You can't sit down, have a  drink and order food.  Our food came out before our drinks.  Anyone like this?"}
{"text":"Good tacos. Quesadilla was good. Tomatoes not very ripe. No sour cream and cabbage is used rather than lettuce. Bean dip was just ok. Salsa bar great. Lots of good choices. Margaritas are 2 for 1 all the time but only huge size."}
{"text":"We were traveling in the Fountain Hills area and looking for a place to get some tacos for cinco de mayo. The tacos were very tasty. we also got guacamole with chips which we took back to our RV. I would recomend this place to eat."}
{"text":"Location is key! With views of the fountain, sombrero hats for decoration and to top it off, delicious food. I, myself ordered from the brunch burros section the Huevon - Big eggs, Chorizo, Hashbrowns and Queso Monterey and plenty of salsa to choose from the salsa bar. I would definitely Recomend this to anyone looking for a five star experience."}
{"text":"Fresh and authentic Mexican food that is very hard to find in the valley. 2 for 1 margaritas everyday is also a big plus. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had our second visit tonight and ordered the nachos again. It's both an appetizer and a meal rolled into one. One of our party is a vegan and pleased her dietary restrictions could be met. Happy hour is Monday through Friday."}
{"text":"Yum! Love the selection of salsas. We tried the bacon appetizer with our lunch specials and it was all so good!! Looking forward to another visit"}
{"text":"Six of us went to La Botana Friday night before the play. We were greeted warmly, the Hostess explained the procedures for ordering, told us about the buy one get one 42 ounce margaritas. The food was very good, the salsa bar a great addition."}
{"text":"Great food with excellent service.  The entrance is tricky to find, but once you get there, you're golden. Coming from Saguaro, turn left onto Parkview, then a quick left into the parking lot.  Turn left and you will see the entrance.  Plenty of parking.  This isn't Taco Bell, that's for sure.  Fresh ingredients, made to order.  This is the second location for the owners, having started in Tucson.  Can't get more original than that.    The Text-Mex influence is obvious.  Yet, many of their recipes are original.    Their menu is extensive and displayed on the board behind the cash register.  I niece they also have take out menus.  The salsa bar is a great idea.  Everyone can choose the taste, heat and texture they like.  Many choices, too.  We ordered the margarita special...two HUGE margaritas.  One would have been enough to share.  You may have to wait for a table, but it's well worth the wait.  Next time you are in Fountain Hills, check this place out."}
{"text":"Had there Uno Combo with chicharron and flower tortillas.  This is 3 soft tacos with whole pinto beans (no pork) and cilantro rice.  The rice didn't have cilantro but tacos did...i don't like cilantro, but i picked it out.  Tacos also had chopped cabbage for crunch and it tasted great. Beans could use some kind of pork. Rice was cooked well.  The two could use some more flavor, but it healthy."}
{"text":"Very good food ,homemade from the owners region, Carlos ( part owner) is a  honest and friendly guy, not your  everyday  usual Mexican food, so glad for the change, have been there twice and will return"}
