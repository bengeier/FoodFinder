{"text":"Yum! Pork bun must try!!!  Popcorn chicken is authentic. Love the crispy basil.  For the quality, amount of food, location, can't beat that.  It is on my top list to choose from the surrounding lunch place.

Oh and trendy and hip for hang out and enjoy a bubble tea.  Ok ok ok, I admit I have to order the pork bun too!"}
{"text":"I stopped in twice in the past month or so for dinner, it's quite nice.

The menu is quite extensive, they even have Peking duck. They seem to be changing their menu, but all the standards are there, like hot and sour soup, dumplings and chow mein and such.

they also have many bubble tea choices. When you check in on yelp you get a free drink, I don't know how long that offer is on for but I got it both times I was there...

The food is decent, not chinatown quality but it's downtown and it's good enough to save you a trek all the way to chinatown.

I really like their chicken soy sauce served with rice, it's a picture on the window, or on the chinese menu. I'm told they are printing their new menu.

the place looks really nice and trendy, also the bathroom is very clean. the staff is super nice. I love this place and will be coming often :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has pretty nice decor, love the milk crate chairs. The food however isn't anything special. The popcorn chicken is better than any of the other restaurants selling Taiwanese popcorn chicken though. The chicken cutlet with rice was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Mon Chicha is a Taiwanese Eatery. I found the variety of Taiwanese dishes offered was nice and the bubble tea they have is amazing in quality and flavour. 
I found the popcorn chicken and okonomyaki underwhelming. They do have a nice steamed pork bun and the flavours come through beautifully. This place is a nice fun spot when you're craving some Asian snack foods. 

On the other hand I found they're pricing was significantly more expensive than comparable restaurants like Nos Thes. I would rather go there for comparable food and bubble tea."}
{"text":"Walked in here last week in a desperate effort to find somewhere to eat around 9:30 pm on a weekday and it was a mistake..

My first clue that something was off should have been the fact that other restaurants near ChiCha were packed, but this place was dead silent. The second clue should have been the immense number of fruit flies that decorated the tables and air of the restaurant. 

Nonetheless, we were hungry and tired so we bit the bullet and placed our orders. We shared the potato salad with sesame oil, ginger beef, and the scalded beef. The potato salad was just ok (but was the best dish on the table) - we only ate half of it. The ginger beef was possibly the worst I've ever had with large chunks of barely cooked ginger that were extremely unpleasant to eat. The scalded beef was swimming in a thick gravy and wasn't very edible.

Overall, a pretty dismal experience but maybe we just didn't order the right stuff since some people seem to enjoy the food here! I, sadly, am not inclined to ever come back!"}
{"text":"Came here twice and wasn't impressed by this place. The drinks are ok, nothing impressive. The food menu is creative, but the food itself is very \"meh\". The tables and chairs aren't confortable so it's not a good place to chill or to study."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. I recommend the iced coffee and the General Tao chicken . Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner recently and overall I really enjoyed it. My husband thought it was ok (However, he doesn't generally like Taiwanese food and he hates bubble tea, but bless his heart, agreed to go with me to this place anyway).

The only Taiwanese dish that my husband likes is popcorn chicken, so that's what he ordered ($6.95). He also wanted a decaf coffee, but unfortunately they don't sell decaf.

The popcorn chicken is an appetizer, so portion size was pretty small. It came with delicious fried basil leaves. The popcorn chicken itself was just ok. It wasn't all that crispy and there was too much batter for popcorn chicken, in my opinion.

I had the Fried Chicken Bento Box Special, which is a Bento Box and a drink for $14.95. This is a great deal because the Bento Box alone is $13.95, so for an extra dollar you can get a drink that would cost over $4 alone. For your drink you can get a regular tea, flavoured tea, soy milk or a bottle of water. I chose a lychee tea and I paid an extra $0.50 for tapioca pearls. You can choose the level of ice and sugar. I got 30% sugar and 30% ice (meaning 30% of what they would normally do).

I loved the Bento Box. The fried chicken was very reminiscent of Hot Star Large Fried Chicken that I had in Toronto, except smaller, boneless and less salty. It was battered and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It wasn't overly oily/greasy. The rice was nicely done. The salad was fresh and contained mixed greens, grape tomatoes and cucumbers. The dressing was light but full of ginger and garlic flavour. The Bento Box also had some pickled carrots and get this: a dessert! I wasn't sure what it was at first, but it was kind of like a donut and kind of like fried bread. It was drizzled with chocolate syrup and condensed milk. It was unusual but cool.

My lychee green tea with tapioca pearls was just ok. The tea was a bit on the bitter side and the tapioca were a little mushy.

Staff were super nice. The place is cool and eclectic looking. There are lights that look like light sabers hanging from the ceiling. They have tables with real chairs and some tables have milk crates with cushions on them for chairs (!) There are some exposed pipes that contribute to the industrial look. 

You order at the cash register, pay and then they bring your food to you. 

I would definitely order the Fried Chicken Bento Box again, but I also want to try the Takoyaki and the savoury crepes sometime.

Oh, and in case you're wondering, I did offer to get my husband a salad or a sandwich there or to take him somewhere else afterwards, but he just wanted to stop at the Couche Tard and supplement his dinner with a bag of chips and a bag of beef jerky, lol. O_o"}
{"text":"Service was slow even if I was the only customer... Took over 10 minutes to get my drink.

Had a traditional pearl milk tea, tasted nothing like tea nor milk. Very disappointed. 

However; the \"light sabres\" as decoration are pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Super excited when this place first opened up! Taiwan is my favorite place on earth 90% because of its foods, so I wanted to try it asap.

The decor inside was very cute and unique. Wifi was readily available. The servers were also very nice and approachable.

The food though was kind of disappointing. Here is what I had:
- Chicken popcorn: too much breading, too little flavour. The spinach was the next part of the dish.
- Yakisoba: hmm I'd have to say this is the worst yakisoba I've had in a restaurant. Dry and flavourless. Avoid.
- Fried mixed mushrooms: my favorite dish. The breading is still a bit much, but the flavour and the combination with the texture of the mushroom saves it. 
- Unagi and pork belly steamed bun: The meat/fish by itself is well seasoned. But the bread hides the flavour too much. The bread is also cold, which was a weird combo with the warm fillings.

Overall, it's a nice place to hang out. The reward system is also pretty cool. I might come back to try the drinks but probably not the food again."}
{"text":"Best popcorn fried chicken ever. We came in by chance coz I wanted a cup of hot bubble tea. Right now they r doing 50% off for the celebration of Chinese New Year! Authentic Taiwanese popcorn fried chicken."}
{"text":"Super adorable place to eat. They have a varied menu and really comfy seating. 
I really enjoyed sitting down for a snack. I got the popcorn chicken and it was warm, filling, and salty. It's a lovely addition to the food around Concordia, which I'd grown tired of.

It's a counter service kinda place but they still delivered it to me which was so nice of them. They also could tell when I needed a napkin! (This could be because I was the only customer inside at that time but still a nice attention)

Also love the daily mystery drink special. Every day they have a new mystery drink for 2.99$!"}
{"text":"I really wanted bubble tea so I ordered from Mon ChiCha on Just Eat. The bubbles in the bubble tea were weird and mushy. The tea was overly sweet also, it tastes like I'm drinking the water that's cooking the bubbles instead whatever tea I ordered. The brownish black colour doesn't make it look appetizing either. Food portions are really small also and their \"scalded beef\" is really chewy. I guess the only saving grace was their mixed vegetable stir fry which wasn't bad. Guess I'm having disappointment for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Being there 3 times. Food is delicious. I love the Chinese chicken and pork. Food is nicely cooked, the stuff is friendly and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Writing a review after going there 4 times. Why? Because their menu is rather expansive and I gotta make sure I try most things first.
And they never disappointed! Every time I go it's mostly empty...which is a shame because their teas and food is good!
Tried the rice burger, takoyaki, popcorn chicken, crepe, and 4 different teas in different occasions.
I'm a huge fan of takoyaki, and theirs was definitely up to Japanese restaurant standards. If not better.
Also tried their chocolate pork crepe. Yeah, it sounds insane, but the chocolate sauce felt like a sweet tahini that complements the pork floss and pork belly strips.
In terms of bubble tea, their menu is on par with other tea shops. I tried a tea in which the flavour profile didn't match what I expected. The staff made us a new one and we had a conversation about tea leaves and different strains within each type. They're super friendly! 
The rice burger was a bit meh. Basically a constructed (Er...opposite of deconstructed) bowl of gyudon.
Prices are not exactly cheap, but reasonable.
Everytime, I had some sort of discount. They did half price for Chinese New Year, got coupons on apps, and has a rewarding points system. (5 stamps one free drink)
Free wifi is available as well.
My only complaint is that seating is not comfortable, especially the milk crate area. Also, their drinks are only one size."}
{"text":"On the way home, I walked by Mon ChiCha and glimpsed what was a new bubble tea spot to me. We were in the area again the following day so it was clearly meant to be!

They had a buy one, get one drink free promotion going on when we were there. The only restriction was that you had to order the same type of drink to get the offer.

I have no idea what this place was beforehand but it has an industrial, club/loungey feel to it. At least the music made me want to start dancing like I was up in da club. The exposed brick, slick tables and cute anime chalk drawings made for a very cool interior.

The drink menu is pretty big; I like how they categorize everything and separate into hot/cold options. There's their top hits, flavoured/latte/creamy/herbal cha, smoothies and specials. There's also a food menu but we'd already eaten dinner. Mainly Taiwanese snacks and desserts (egg waffles and crepes).

- Passion fruit (MT9) and mango yogurt with mango frubo (MT8) ($5.45) - you can customize the ice and sugar levels. The drink was refreshing and you get real pieces of passion fruit. The tapioca texture was good and they let me get half tapioca/half lychee pieces. The mango frubo was a little too artificial tasting but I did like how the frubo exploded in your mouth.

Cute spot and I would easily come back. Perfect spot to bring a date or to come to after you've had dinner in the 'hood."}
{"text":"Went there about a year ago and was very impressed. Returned this week, after confirming on their website that the menu hadn't changed, and was very disappointed. 

The menu is completely different than what's on their website and is now much more of a traditional Canadian Chinese food offering, but with confusing descriptions. The waiter had no clue about the dishes on the menu and misguided us on everything we ordered.

Fried noodles were soaked in a sweet sauce. Peanut butter dumplings had more hot sauce than peanut butter.  We hardly ate anything we were served and left hungry and disappointed.

Montreal now has an excellent selection of Asian food restaurants. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Can not say anything good about this place except very gutsy to try to compete with variety of Asian restaurants in the area while providing a below mediocre food at higher prices and smaller portions than all others."}
{"text":"Decent Asian food, had the Taiwanese chicken for appetizers which was pretty good. Comes with a lot of fried basil which was nice. We shared their 'chow mein' which was tasty and I had their braised pork over rice which was pretty good. Also had coconut milk tea with boba was also good."}
{"text":"A convenient location near the guy Concordia metro station. The deco is unique. Something wrong with their venting system, the noise level was high.

I had three small dishes. The bun with pork belly 5$. The bun is like a small sandwich but with steamed fluffy bread. It should be steamed hot with cold cucumber and juicy pork. But unfortunately mine was near cold. The filling was very good so flavorful and complex with layered taste. The hot bun with rising steam should be the soul but they lost it. The popcorn chicken with fried basil was ok, lack of salt and pepper but the basil was really a nice touch. The soba noodle was a OK, tasted like chow main.
The price is a bit high considering you want a filling lunch and have to order three small dishes. Modestly recommend the bun. Even though it disappointed me a little, it worth a try."}
{"text":"I got sick eating here :( 

I have a strong third world stomach so this rarely happens, but damn, it really ruined my dinner that day."}
{"text":"I tried their Hainan chicken rice and it was really quite bad, even the general tao chicken, which I rarely eat, tasted better. Their drink with green tea looks particularly suspicious, like with a fluorescent green dye inside, making me feel very uncomfortable. The place is not very big and a bit weird. Very close to the metro station Concordia, it is quite busy at lunch and supper time. However, I wouldn't want to try more food from them anymore."}
{"text":"First of all, best popcorn chicken on the planet and secondly, the staff are really friendly, helpful to newcomers, and fun - plus there is always good ambient music playing and aye : there's the chicken.  Modern and open, yet highly functional interior with large family style tables, \"Mon\" is a great experience overall."}
{"text":"I am really happy to have discovered Mon Chicha, I have been looking for a place that offers a nice bento box for lunch and this bistro certainly delivers. The flavors and cooking is spot on. The portions aren't huge, but it has just the right mix. I loved that my salmon teriyaki bento came with a few pieces of sweet, fried mantou. As a combo the meal is reasonably priced. The other items on the menu seemed a little pricey, but I will definitely be back to try them next time. At the end of our meal, the waiter brought a cold yuzu-lime drink for us to try. It was refreshingly tasty! I certainly hope it will find its way onto their permanent drink menu!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Inside the restaurant, the decor is pretty nice. Their neon hanging lights give the restaurant a nice touch. The drawings on the wall were pretty cute too.

FOOD: Their food was NOTHING special unfortunately. Their yakisoba noodles were very bland, and tasted bad even. Their sweet potatos were too salty (I couldn't even finish them) and their buns are TINY and are also dry and flavorless. Both quality and quantity were disappointing. Overall, I will NOT be coming back here. I do not recommend this place at all...

PRICE: Yes, it's affordable and there are promotions sometimes but the quality and taste of the food is just not worth it. I would not spend any more of my money here.

SERVICE: Not bad, the servers did what they were supposed to do. Nothing more or less."}
{"text":"Ok soooo I had mixed feelings about this place because my friends and I tried a whole range of drinks at this place, and we haven't been impressed by a single one. They were all chatime quality bubble teas: not many options contain real fruit juice, and does contain a lot of sugar.

Average drinks but... We went mostly to chill between friends. It's a nice lounge and closes later than other places (around midnight). There's no way I was going to order food here, judging from the teas.

Anyway, after my friend Jennifer P. visited the bistro and actually tried food, I decided to give it  a go. Wow, the pork belly 'bao sandwich' is actually not bad. It had half the usual Chinese flavours, and the steamed bao had a good texture. I rate this 4/5 since I haven't had pork belly bao anywhere else in Montreal. 

Now the teas are worth perhaps 3/5 on average. I'd avoid ordering teas that comes with ice cream. The ice cream is actually DILUTED in the tea (wtf?!?!) so it was just a creamy tea. 

I love the ambience and decor, there's free wifi, a chalk board wall (yes you can draw on the wall), good lighting, and interesting furniture. Great place for hanging out, Mon Chicha even offers a small menu of cocktails for those who would like a little buzz."}
