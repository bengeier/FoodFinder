{"text":"Peach Garden is located across the street from Pacific Mall, so it makes it a pretty good choice for those who are hungry and are not in the mood for anything in the mall. 

The moment you walk into Peach Gardens, you see a fairly lit restaurant thats styled like most middle end restaurants in Asia, especially Hong Kong. The seating is not extremely modern. but its not like a normal take out restaurants either. It's fairly nice, aesthetic wise to the eye, and you'll feel comfortable eating here.

Like every other Vietnamese restaurant, pho is the top choice here. There are four sizes of Pho, and the large, which is what I got, is filling and great for the price (especially to an American :D). The broth is nice, not the best, but still better than some in the states. There is a taste of MSG, however, and the broth is extremely oily. The flavor is fairly deep and rich, not something I expected. The contents of the bowl is not as plentiful as how it is at my pho joints, but there is enough to fill even the hungriest of customers. The noodles were soft, and seemed a bit overcooked. The beef was sliced really thin, was tender, and had pretty nice marbling. I had very little of the animal parts, but the blocks of tendon was a great surprise.

The menu is pretty big, and the prices are reasonable. It's a good place to end your Pacific Mall trip, especially if you're hungry"}
{"text":"Overall pretty standard pho place. More like a 3.5 actually since it is really quite affordable. Came with the boyfriend and he got the beef flank and rare beef pho, and I got the grilled pork rice. I had a bit of his pho, and i enjoyed it, it had the noodle texture that I personally prefer (I don't like the overly thick noodles at some places b/c they don't absorb the flavours of the broth as well and aren't as fun to slurp). I also enjoyed the grilled pork with rice, in that it was really flavourful BUT I'm the type who generally enjoys strong flavours, so for many other people the pork might be a bit over seasoned/salty. Another thing that I commend Peach Garden on is it's speedy service! My bf got his pho pretty much 5 minutes after we placed our order, and I got my dish maybe 10 minutes after. I do wish they would have waited to serve his pho with mine though, since it was hard watching him eat while I was starving =(

TIP: As per most viet/pho places, you help yourselves to utensils at the table. I would recommend rinsing them with your tea before using, b/c some of them have been there a long time I presume, and also other customers may have splashed their sauces and stuff on the utensils by accident (likely, since i saw soup stains on the top of some chopsticks). I thought this was common sense, but it has apparently never occurred to my bf, and his face suddenly darkened as he thought about all the times he never rinsed his utensils for pho.

Also, they are renovating soon, (forgot the date), so would be closed for a short while!"}
{"text":"3.5, especially after the last visit but I'll round up because I normally like this place.

It is located across the parking lot from Pacific Mall, close to the TD and the bakery. Since I do not go to Pacific Mall very often, I do not come here regularly. But I have always enjoyed their pho here. I would get the house combination and a small ($5.50) is enough to fill me up. I like their broth and they put a lot of green onion on top, which I like. It comes with bean sprouts and each tables carry their own supply of chopsticks, spoons and sauce plates. Some places don't have that, and you have to decide whether you want to use your only spoon to enjoy their soup, or put the sauce in. Well, you can always ask for an extra, but :/ Overall, the pho here is a lot more \"flavourful.\" I feel really thirsty after eating it though, so I assume they use quite a bit of MSG. The last time I came here, there was a layer of oil in my soup and I was quite disappointed. First time that my pho came like that though, I hope it's the last time too."}
{"text":"Came here on a week night. It was not busy at all. The service was quick and courteous. I think I just got a bit turned off because it seemed a unsanitary to me. But for a cheap eat it's def. not too bad. 

We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. It was prob the worst I've ever had. It was way too gingery plus the dish wasn't that big. Also had the Vermicelli (bun?) with shredded pork, spring rolls, sausage. the meat was great except for the shredded pork. There was so little !! It might as well not be in the dish... Plus we had so much Vermicelli & too little of that sauce. It was a little bit dry. 

The utensils were all placed in a container The chopsticks ends were facing down... god knows what it has touched or at the bottom? Also there was a small jar of hot sauce at the table. Towards the end of night, the waitress took it  back. I thought they were just going to throw it out... turns out  at the end of the day, they will dump it all back into a larger container in the fridge &  serve it again the next day. 

Service was great though. We had ordered and even before I could excuse myself to the ladies room the first dish had arrived!"}
{"text":"I drove by Pacific Mall and Market Village almost everyday and I never notice Peach Garden Restaurant until 2 weeks ago!

It is located in the plaza right across Pacific Mall and next to Rolling Pot Shabu Shabu. I was here on a weekday for lunch and it is hard to find a parking spot, I cannot imagine what a task it can be on weekends!

The interior of Peach Garden has older decoration, not the moden chic that is common with the newer restaurant. There are booth seatings on both side and scattered tables that can fit a bigger group in the middle.

I ordered the medium ($5.50) Pho with rare beef and tripes and a Rainbow Drink Che ba Mau ($2.75). 

There are 4 sizes of Pho here, I am glad I order a medium instead of a large because here medium is what I expect for a medium. The broth is nice, not too salty just perfect for my taste bud. The noodle though is dried but plentiful. The rare beef is prepared a little different than the other restaurants. It is more like a rare roast beef that is sliced really thin.

I have to say the price of  drinks and juice here is really reasonable. Usually the iced coffee cost $3.25-$3.75, but here everything cost $2.75. The fresh juices here are all for $3.00. I ended up cannot resist the temptation and order a Rainbow drink as a dessert. Yummmmm (I just found out on the internet that it has over 1000 calories... glad I did not  know this fact when I am enjoying it!)

There are a lot of different items on the menu but since this is my first time eating here I can only comment on my Pho.

BTW, this place is call Peach Garden Express. Yes it only takes 2 min to serve the drink and 5 min for my Pho to arrive! Good if you are in a rush!
