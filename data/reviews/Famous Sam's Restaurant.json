{"text":"Great burgers, fries are middle-of-the-road, and a drink -- a lunch combo that will put you to sleep for the afternoon! :) My burger was pink in the middle, but considering it was lunch hour and the lineup was busy, I didn't bother mentioning it."}
{"text":"I use to love this place I've been going all my life. When I was a kid I use to love stopping there for a triple thick milk shake or a burger and fries.   Now it's overpriced and the food keeps getting worse. The last time I went there I got the home burger and fries with gravy. I asked for a banquet. They said with cheese and bacon. I asked for peamale instead of bacon. I was charged. 3 dollars !!!  The Burger looked gray. It was undercooked and over spiced it tasted a bit like an italian meatball. To much oregano or parsley. The burger was really thin. Well at least half of it was thin the other side was average. It was a terrible experience. I was with a friend and he's not much of a food critic and even he said it was bad.   So I said to myself I'll give it one more shot. I still like their breakfast. So I went there with a couple of friends. I ordered the 3 eggs over easy with sausage and home potatoes. Well the sausage which I love had this mysterious flavor I've never tasted before. I know they deepfry their sausage so I couldn't for the life me figure out what that flavor was. Now my eggs they were really wet like the white didn't get cooked or it was cover in water. I just ate the yolks. The potatoes were good thank god !! I didn't want to leave starving.   Overall I will never go there again. It's to bad it was one of the few places that have lasted around the Stouffville area that I use to like to go too. I really miss all the old places we use to have."}
{"text":"Food : Menu has lots of choices. Some comes with coffee (don't think they have free refill even I never bother to ask). Taste is similar as other family diners. Nothing really special.   Pros : more than 1 big screen TVs, free wifi. Washroom (ladies) is old (old family diner) but still cclean. LLBO (but don't think they have wine !)  Cons : They don't take credit card but only debit or cash. There's more than 2 staff standing next to the front cash lady; they should clean up the table instead. The table I sat was a bit dirty. (But staff still have time to clean up....unsure when there's busy lunch or dinner time...don't think they have time to clean up...I saw a cart filled with dirty dishes, sitting in front of ladies' room !!!) Location : Good location at the intersection of Woodbine / Stouffville.   Tips : if you order comes with coffee, ask them if they can serve you after meal is ready. I was waiting more than 5 minutes for my meal to be cooked by the chefs, after the front cash lady (assumed she's the owner!) already put my hot coffee on the tray while I was in line. Good it's spring but sure my coffee will getting cold if it's in the winter !"}
{"text":"Famous Sam's sold a few years ago and the quality went with it. It's sad . The place had a steady stream of workers and breakfast seeking groups of three or more . Now ....not so much . I am guessing the guests will dwindle away as did the quality of the food. A burnt cheese burger tasted way under cooked. Taking a closer look and it's obvious the burger is more bread crumbs and fillers than anything like ground beef . Don't think it was a vegan burger but certainly could have taken down a few gluten free indivuals. I liked this place and have given it more than one shot since the take over. Famous Sam's is no longer famous for decent food . By the way, if you want to pretty the place up, paint the entire ceiling tile not just the stain. $17.00 burger combo got me nothing but gut rot . Totally gross."}
{"text":"Sam's has very good home burger, definately recommend the home burger over the regular hamburger, it's bigger and has more flavour.  onion rings and fries are good as well.  Good souvlaki, good ice cream, good breakfast.   if i have one complaint, and i hope someone from Sam's is reading this, they really need to renovate.  i know it's a typical Macedonian/Greek burger joint but the seats aren't even comfortable any more, and they are cushioned benches!  it just makes you wanna take the food home and eat.   i'm sure they have the money, they're always busy.  Definately a good burger joint and nice people.....although i remember one time i said what i wanted and said mayonnaise last after he already put on the other condiments, he shook his head all pissed off cuz the mayonnaise wasn't in a squeezable tube.....oh well, it was kinda funny at the time.......i think next time i'm gonna say \" lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mustard, ketchup.......................and mayo\"  just for kicks."}
{"text":"New ownership but they dish it out great!   Burgers are decent.  Breakfast is always good.   Its a fast paced diner.  I wouldnt consider it the best food around...its tasty, priced good, served fast, what else do you need?  Been coming here for years and always a good experience."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened, this place used to be so good.  We spent $30.00 for a hamburger, onions rings, fries and a BLT.  The hamburger was tasteless, the BLT had too much Mayo (I like Mayo) and the fries were under done."}
{"text":"The Food: We all ordered the same thing-the breakfast which included your choice of bacon, sausage or ham, 3 eggs, toast and potatoes. Everything was ok except for my eggs. They were really weird. I ordered over easy and they came out watery, not runny. My sister's were fine, so I found that very odd.   The Place: The restaurant has the feel of an old diner. It's very homey and old fashioned.  The Service: The cashiers were really nice and patient with us even when we changed an order.  The Verdict: My sister says that their peameal sandwich is really fantastic, so maybe I would go back to try that, but I wouldn't go back for their breakfasts. Also, it's very much out of the way for me so unless I'm in that neighborhood again, I wouldn't drive all the way there just to eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"New owners for the past couple of months, food used to be better with previous owners which had it for decades. Initially portion sizes became smaller and so did the beef burgers which they used.   Overall the food is good for what you pay and beats most fast food joints in my opinion. Interior decor is pretty bad though. They attempted to clean the place up a bit but did not go about doing it correctly. Should have invested a bit and done it properly. Sort of a dive."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast in the morning.  Generous portions, good coffee, good service.  Fast and always friendly.  These guys have been doing this for a while and it shows.  In the middle of no where.  Usually came here before Golfing at Station Creek.  Lots of ClubLink members around.  No longer a member so not here as often."}
{"text":"Famous Sam's is anything but famous, except for the locals. If you ever find yourself travelling up the 404 near breakfast, lunch or dinner, get off at Stouffville Side Road and make a trip to Famous Sam's for some good old fashion down home comfort food.   Classic dinner style breakfasts of any description. Everyday they feature a few  lunch and dinner specials, all the kind of food they will fill your belly and warm you up (and slow you down and make you want to sleep).   Now, do not go to Sam's expecting anything but diner style food. They don't do any one thing amazing, they do all their food good and work hard at it.   I have gourmet tastes and have eatin at some very high end resturants, I'm giving Sam's a 4/5 not because I'm comparing it to gourment, I'm giving Sam's a 4/5 because it deserves a 4/5 for a Diner.   If new and exciting is your thing don't go here, if old fashion and reliable heartly belly filling comfort food is your thing, go here."}
{"text":"Food quality 2 stars.  Portion/Value +0.5 star.  Overall 2.5 stars.  It was my first time here, and probably not the last because this diner is nearby.  Yet lesson learned is to stick with uncomplicated, all day breakfast, and toasts with butter not jam.  Why so specific?  Some ingredients didn't seem fresh.  The ham that came with my breakfast tasted a bit sour.  The jam from package was so dry that it couldn't be spread.  The eggs and toasts were fresh and cooked well.    BF ordered butter chicken lunch deal.  He said the chicken strangely seemed to be tandoori chicken (orange in colour) soaked in butter chicken sauce.  If you looked sideway on the Canadianized treatment of the butter chicken, it tasted quite decent.  The naan was more like flat bread.  The basmati rice was delicious and aromatic.  Portion is insane.  Order something that must be made fresh upon order, and you are in for a huge meal at low price.  You may even rate the diner higher than I do if you order this way.  This diner is run like a cafeteria.  Customers line up, order, pay, find a table, pour their own glasses of water from a pitcher, get food from counter when it is ready.  The only thing that is different is customers don't have to bus their own trays."}
{"text":"The place is set up very nicely with many framed and signed pictures of hockey players on the wall and a large amount of seating available. The menu is full of many of the foods you'd expect in a diner - burgers, souvlaki, full breakfast menu as well as a good selection of ice cream and they make everything on demand, so it does take a bit of time for you to receive your order.  The souvlaki I had was not great at all. The meat was juicy, but the outside of the meat was charred in many places and the garlic bread and tzatziki had little taste. The burger looked far better, a large juicy patty with your choice of toppings (cheese is an extra $0.99!).  They accept cash and debit ($0.25 fee) only."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sam's for decades! Can't say enough good things about it. Greasy spoon food, souvlaki is to die for! I would say it's a safe \"go-to\" option. Solid people. For the longest time it was cash only, but the new owners have installed debit now. Only criticism I have is that you have to pay for the usage of the debit service.   Glad to hear the new owners won't change the menu. If it ain't broke..."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever and then some.... Yep it is a total greasy spoon type place and serves all kinds of comfort foods. Many truck drivers and locals show up here. . When I see that mix, I know I am onto something. If the owner is there, he has a radio announcer type voice that will make you smile. He makes the words \"cheeseburger French fries\" sound sexy. Its just a lot of fun.   You can order breakfast at anytime, you can have steak, burgers, poutine, chicken fingers basically anything you want with the fixings. Greek salads, grilled cheese....   They offer milkshakes (old school) and ice cream.   I would not say that you should come up this way to dine but if you are in the area, you should check it out. Bring the kids or bring the parents.  Décor, Old school, lots of signed pics of various people and sports. Lots of booth seating. Not many of these diners left so enjoy.  Bring cash to pay. They have an ATM but who wants to pay that fee."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever and I went to it years and years and years ago.  Haven't been back until my latest check-in.    I guess ownership changed hands but the meal must be good as the place was packed!  It's like a tour bus full of golfers stopped for a bite!  Almost true...this is a local food stop but a lot of golfers get a meal before or after a round here.  I was there to get my energy level up before tackling the hills, trees, sands, rivers, lakes...I know tough life eh!?!  :)  The place has such a large menu and also specials that look to good to pass up.  Decided on the Jerk Chicken - was the owners recommendation.  She was right!  Juicy, tender chicken - could have used a bit more hit on the spice, with generous side fixin's.  Buddy of mine had the burger and fries - again, good burger and quite the filler up'er.  It's been upgraded quite a bit since I've been there.  The only place that needs a re-work and even a cleaning is the bathrooms.  Drop from a 4 to a 3 because I went there...oh yes...I like to clean up after eating.  I eventually went to the golf club to do that!  Want a comparison...just as messy as a restroom in old...old...old...Chinatown.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Traditional greasy spoon...had breakfast, cheese omelette which was like melted velveta..very retro.  Nice people, quick & Fast service."}
