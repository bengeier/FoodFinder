{"text":"I visited this place with some friends to have brunch. I think it is a nice place with good staff.   They had a breakfast buffet, I think mostly for free breakfast patrons of hotel, but we opted for menu. It is a little overpriced for what they serve. My omelet was good but not exceptional for the price. Wait staff was very friendly. For tea, there is not much selection considering the price.   I would rather go to other reasonably priced places at walking distance next time I am there and I am paying out of pocket."}
{"text":"David's in the Marriott for Sunday brunch.  Simple breakfast buffet.  Loads of carbs- bagel, muffins, breads, etc.  Great fresh fruit selection. Standards- bacon, & link sausage, greasy potatoes, sausage , gravy & biscutis. Make your own waffles.   Only one of the two omelette stations were open - long line.  But Melinda was the star of the morning.  She crafted  wonderful made to order omelette - worth the wait.  Table service lacked -hard to get a pot of hot coffee.  The place was packed with guests of hotel.  For those who wander in it's $14 a head - $30 with tax plus tip for 2."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast buffet with made to order eggs and omelettes.  Server for drinks and extras was on top of things and offered a fresh coffee to go. Nice touch."}
{"text":"We often stay in the Key Center because of the good download location and reasonable price.   We always used to get the breakfast buffet because it was fast and good.  It's still fast but it's losing the good.   The offering was much more diverse in the past few years but has dwindled off. I'm not sure if that is to save money or what but it is noticeable.    The food is still ok but you are getting less bang for your dollar. It's a bummer."}
{"text":"I attended a conference at the Cleveland Convention Center and a friend suggested we meet at David's for coffee.   I ordered a hot chocolate and this is why it was good: They gave me my own little pot of hot chocolate (2 mugs worth) and a side of whipped cream (real whipped cream) so I could control my whipped cream portion.   My colleague and I enjoyed our beverages (he had black coffee). The server brought the bill but then she didn't come back for at least 15 minutes. We both had places to go so he switched his credit card for cash and we walked out. The lack of service was annoying - and they weren't busy at the time, so they don't have that excuse."}
{"text":"Dave is closed.  I'm told this is permanent.  All that is here is a hotel breakfast place with an overpriced buffet."}
{"text":"One of my lunch spots I go to on break from work during the week. This place has a nice quiet atmosphere during the day and it is relaxing to get away. The food is delicious to me as well. I've had the Reuben, Burger, French Onion Soup, Caesar Salad, and the Turkey Sandwich. So I've had a fair share of different items on the menu and every time it is solid and delicious.  Definitely worth it to check out if you work downtown. It's hidden away in the Marriott downtown next to the Key Building. It's a nice spot to unwind and get away from work for a bit and have a good meal."}
{"text":"David's is a restaurant located in the Cleveland Marriott Downtown in the Key Center.  They serve breakfast and lunch here.  I had breakfast one morning. Had a bowl of Raisin Bran with fat free milk, and a small plate of scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes and one slice of bacon from the breakfast buffet. The eggs, potatoes, and bacon were cooked perfectly. The eggs were moist and tasty, the potatoes were fork tender without being overcooked or dried out, and the bacon was succulent - a nice smokey flavor with a hint of salt of and nice combination of crispness and chewiness.  As with all major hotels - the price for breakfast is a bit on the steep side.  Still, next time I stay here I'd eat breakfast here again!"}
{"text":"I can only review the breakfast buffet. It was pretty standard. There was a good omelette station and a decent selection of meats, eggs, and other breakfast foods. The staff was a little confused at times, but very friendly and accommodating.   The best part is that it is self serve, quick, and convenient. I was in a hurry during my stay so I was in and out and full in 10 minutes. I definitely recommend getting breakfast with your stay if you're a busy person.  3 stars because it wasn't anything special really."}
{"text":"Awful!  Over medium eggs came out with liquid whites that ran all over the plate. Egg sandwich had rotten turkey bacon.  Egg shells in both dishes.  Not Marriott quality.  Worst $40 bucks ever..."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast buffet here. Not a huge selection but all of the food is fresh and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Buffet:  A wonderful breakfast buffet.  I was part of a wedding party so don't know about prices, but the buffet was amazing!  Everything was fresh, there was a large variety (Turkey and Pork Sausage), there was an omlette bar, waffle toppings galore and the bacon.  OOohhh, the bacon!    Best bacon I've had in a while.  Great service, short lines.  In terms of breakfast buffets, I was very impressed."}
{"text":"We had Saturday brunch, buffet style. The food, overall, was good. In particular they have very tasty bacon."}
