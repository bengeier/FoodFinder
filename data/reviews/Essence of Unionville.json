{"text":"High tea review: I was disappointed with their lack of service and quality of food. I really wanted to enjoy this experience because the Hilton brand stands for quality and their restaurant standards should not be other wise.  $20 for high tea is your average price but wasn't worth the stress with staff and lack luster taste of the food. Beautiful presentation and lovely decor. The macarons were the only thing I enjoyed. Wait staff complaining loudly non stop for 2 hours to each other and only moving together as a group of 3 is unacceptable. This was my second time here for high tea and it's sad how things have changed for the worse. At least it was ayce. Make sure you ask them what kind of tea they have because they will automatically bring you a black tea. I got attitude when I asked them if they had earl grey. Waiter said 'you should had said something'. I replied 'You walked away. You just asked coffee or tea and I was trying to ask you what kind of tea but you walked away.' They serve Tazo tea."}
{"text":"We had Christmas Eve buffet dinner there. Food was ok at the price of $42 per person. Service was terrible. We were rushed to finish dinner within 1.5 hours without being notified ahead of time. Bill was left on our table right at 1.5 hours time frame. 

The server insisted that phone confirmation was made to each customer and told us about the time limit. However, we have never received any phone calls at all. We told the server about this and stated that is not reasonable to finish dinner within 1.5 hours. There was no apologize at all because of this incident and the servers started being rude to us. Since then we received no service at all. Also, food stopped being served half an hour before the end of time limit. 

We are so disappointed about this restaurant and will not consider going back again."}
{"text":"Poor service! I would expect some good service especially in a 5 star hotel. I was there for an Afternoon tea buffet. Not much varieties for $24.99. No baked cookies,  only sandwiches, some desserts and the buffet was very limited. Nothing extravagant. I ordered tea and when asked for more tea, all I got was hot water for my used tea bag. This is cheap. How much does it cost to give a new tea bag! How can you call this \"buffet\". Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Once again we come to this place.  The waiter knows us well and greets us very politely.  For an afternoon tea buffet, I expect a lot more varieties.  There are 5 or 6 different types of sandwiches, diced fruits, croissants, pastries, cheese cakes, apple strudels and cakes.  Tea or coffee is included.  The parking is free if you let the restaurant knows your plate number. For a price of $21 per person, I think it is on the expensive side given the food choices.  I suggest that the buffet should include the cakes available for sale in the cake shop that are a lot nicer."}
{"text":"This place serves basic hotel food. Was here for a work conference and no one liked their  food that much, even  the  desserts. Roasts were overdone, butternut squash soup was bland and watery, sparse vegetables and over sweetend desserts."}
{"text":"The variety of items is very limited and not extraordinary. Everything is very sweet and a lot of items are very similar with a slight twist. Rather on the expensive side, it's not really worth it. However, the sandwiches are delicious! Especially the smoked salmon."}
{"text":"Located inside the Hilton Suites Hotel in Markham (Hwy 7 & Warden), we went for their Sunday Brunch buffet.  Standard fare food was excellent as was the service.  Pricey @ approx $60. per person."}
{"text":"Gave this restaurant this rating due to nostalgia and the service. The service was top-notch no matter who the server was, so that's to be unrecommended.

Drink menu is adequate. Unfortunately, the quality of food has gone down in recent years. No more rosemary lamb chops, no more grilled fish, you get the idea. What they have is palatable, but there is a huge reduction in the menu. (not sure why)

Steak and hen is ok. Breakfast spread is fair, not sure about sunday brunch though, only because I haven't had any recently.

P.S. Do not order the Singaporean pan-fry, salty to the max. The soups too."}
{"text":"Really horrible. Thought it would be more \"afternoon tea\" however it was more like sending you off after a stay in the hotel. I'm not sure what the craze is - since this is definitely not afternoon tea. It's more like brunch/ afternoon snacks."}
{"text":"Not one of the greatest breakfast buffets I've seen - just OK.  Fruit choices are not your top of the line (no berries of any kind, for instance), and don't go expecting smoked salmon, although they do have some cold cuts and limited cheese(s).  No omelette station either.  Most surprising is the lack of a Chinese option in this Chinese-strong market: congee, maybe?  But perhaps good old picky, demanding me shouldn't expect too, too much for \"only\" $18 (continental is $15).  We've had our share of inattentive waiters here, even bad attitude, while others, like the one this morning, are hard-working and pleasant. Being able to get the oft-eschewed bran muffin made a good impression on me - so, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Come in with the right expectations and you won't be disappointed. I came here for an afternoon tea. It costs $20 per person and it's a buffet style. This is a very cheap price point considering it's a buffet and a 4 star hotel. The overall Experience and setting is not like four season or shangrila's high tea but you get what you pay for. Definitely a good value but if you are looking for a luxurious high tea experience  then it's not for you."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Essence of Unionville for approx. 7 years now. It has easily become our favourite place for Sunday brunch with family/and or friends. The service is exceptional as is the food selection. Once you are seated you are offered complimentary flute of orange juice. They have many breakfast favourites such as eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, made to order omelet station. The selection is great! Prime rib, 3-4 different entrees, fresh vegetables, roasted potatoes, several salads to choose from, fresh in house made sushi, crab legs, shrimp, mussels, smoked salmon, antipasto - the list goes on!

The desserts are out of this world and made in house by their very own pastry chef! Large selection of fruit, mousses, cakes, creme brulee (one of the best i've had!).

I was just there last Sunday for brunch with my hubby. There was an item i couldn't eat due to an allergy issue. One of the chefs offered to make me a plate so that it wouldn't include the item i was allergic to and personally brought it to our table for me, The servers are so nice, friendly and often come over to ask how everything is, topping up drinks, clearing plates away so often that you don't even have to ask! They always remember a face they've seen before, so we often get a server that we've had on a previous visit and they will remember what we like to drink whether its a soft drink with our meal or cappuccino with dessert.  It is always super busy, but the service & food is always top notch.

We've tried 2-3 places along Highway 7 for brunch and this has remained at the top of our list! If i had to choose 1 thing that i didn't like, it would be that they don't have a kid friendly menu for kids 8 & under. Considering the fact that they are in a hotel where families do stay, it would be nice to see a couple of items (mini pizzas, tenders & fries, pasta, waffles, pancakes?) for kids. Price for adults is $38.50 and $20 for kids.  

They offer special brunches for Mother's Day, Christmas Day (weekday brunch is offered during the holidays in December), Easter (egg hunt for the kids!), New Years Eve & New Years Day to name a few :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this hotel for several work conferences/visiting friends for several years but never have been to the buffet.  I didn't even know that if you weren't a hotel guest you could still enjoy the restaurant.

This place is located inside the Hilton in Markham.  There is a parking lot (paid) but just write you license plate number down at the restaurant and you get free parking.

This restaurant is actually pretty big - to accommodate it's guests plus the \"outsiders\".  Easily you could have 50+ people in here.  Great for maybe a smaller wedding reception/meal or rehearsal brunch.  It also looks more upscale - dark woods, white cloth napkins with the silverware nestled nicely in them.

The buffet I have to say surprised me.  Well stocked at all times and the variety were impressive.  Fruits, grilled veggies, sushi (not the best...but it was there), cheeses, an omelet station, hot foods like eggs, sausages, chicken (this was pretty good with some sort of gravy like sauce); a couple of salad options, breads/pastries and one whole table devoted to desserts/muffins.  Oh my!  Mostly everything I tried was good.  Is it the greatest -no.  But the variety (not sure if they change it up or this is the standard brunch menu) was a nice surprise b/c I was just expecting the typical brekkie - eggs/toast and some fruit.    

The service while pleasant was a bit slow, which was strange since when we were there it wasn't that busy and I definitely saw enough staff around to handle the amount of guests.  They were a bit busy talking - it took quite awhile to get the bill and then pay."}
{"text":"This review is for the afternoon high tea. I have to say I loved the experience. I like the ability to choose my own desserts and to get up and grab them when I feel like it. Yes, the buffet style isnt as elegant as a sit down service, but I would trade that off for being able to select my own options.
Our server was really good. A nice, older gentlemen. He was attentive and cleared our plates quickly. He also cleaned up a small mess from some spilled tea and did it with delight. Props to his service!
Dessert selections were very decent. I loved the bread pudding and the cakes. Skip the chocolate cake. BORING. The salmon sandwiches and egg ones were the best tasting ones. The tuna was decent too. Overall, I loved this high tea experience. I would come again if I was in the mood for some serious desserts. Oh and there are macarons too. Three different kinds. 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Our family has been to the Essence of Unionville on a few occasions - for a birthday, Sunday brunch, New Years Dinner in the past. The food quality and servings have been very good. Deserts are excellent - at that point you are too full to try the full range especially at the buffet or brunch.

Brunch quality is generally okay although on occasion the beef is a bit tough or dry. Seafood dishes on one occasion was fishy but for the most part good.  There is pasta, mashed potatoes and sauteed root vegetables. Raw salad bar and a small desert selection as well. Pricing is fair given the quality of food.

Generally, this is a go to place now family lives in the area."}
{"text":"The best about coming to Essence is the Sunday brunch. It's all you can eat with a variety of seafood, prim ribs and of course the signature omelette station. 

They also have afternoon tea for $20. The tea selection is basic and not loose leafs. The pastry and sandwich selection was very good especially the smoked salmon. Mmm..."}
{"text":"This review is based purely on the afternoon high tea buffet. Located inside Hilton Hotel. Called and booked a reservation for 3:00pm on a Saturday. You are given a two hour limit. Just park anywhere and upon entering they ask you for your licience plate # so that they can authorize your free parking. $20 per person for AYCE. 

The only reason I am giving this a 1 star review is the quality of food and selections available. The only thing I found decent were the sandwiches. They had tuna, smoked salmon and egg salad sandwich. All were pretty decent. Everything else was crap. 

Based off the pictures posted here I saw macarons and what I thought to be creme brule, however there was none of that available. There was a dessert that looked like a creme brule but it was far from it. I think they use to have macarons but not anymore. The cakes were terrible, the pastries were terrible and just taking one glance at what they had available just turned me right off from the get go. There was no turning back at this point and nothing would have made the experience better...lol. As you can tell I'm just hugely dissapointed. To make things worse there is no tea selection just some Red Rose tea bags. 

I did not eat all that I could eat and I can honestly say I would rather spend my $20 at Tim Hortons. 

Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon tea with my friend on a Sunday.  Price is $23.99 per adult, an assortment of pastry dessert, finger sandwiches, fondue. We got to choose a tea and filled up all sandwiches and desserts, this is buffet style not the usual afternoon tea where they give you a tier of small sandwiches and scones. They had a good selection and we were glad when we went they had French macarons. They refilled things pretty quickly if they ran out and service was good. I wouldn't say the food was top notch, but decent. I wish they had more savoury things than sweets."}
{"text":"If you ever asked how the Mandarin Buffet might do an afternoon tea experience (I know! Who hasn't?), then Essence of Unionville is your definitive response. 

You start with a small-ish spread of savoury finger foods (ie bread with chicken salad, ham and other vaguely and not particularly well seasoned meats).  Follow that with a much larger selection of tarts and desserts, punctuated by a fruit bowl that (judging solely by the lineup) was the star of the table. A forlorn chocolate fountain sits, by itself, on a long table beside a half dozen empty induction  cooktops, wondering if perhaps the chef forgot to bring out half the menu. 

Somewhat oddly, you have no tea options, other than Red  Rose tea. Their website promises a selection of Ten Ren teas, which is no longer the case. 

The seating is in the middle of the lobby of the Hilton, immediately adjacent to a busy hotel bar and a stones throw from an equally busy reception desk. The decor is upscale, with the obligatory \"This-is-an-upscale-restaurant\" wall of wines oddly situated 5 feet off the ground on a far wall. 

Service is attentive, if a little abrupt. The waiter gave us a confused explanation for why someone at our table could not refill his cup with coffee, since he'd first had tea. I guess, \"We want to charge you twice\" would be too transparently capitalist. 

This is not your Shangri-la or Windsor Arms afternoon tea experience. But I strongly believe that a restaurant should be judged by what it aspires to be, and Essence does not pretend to compete with your traditional afternoon tea. Instead, this is a child friendly, buffet style, boisterous, and busy place where you can eat as much, or as little, as you want at a fraction of the price that you'd pay for its more upscale peers. 

And with the more modest goal of presenting you with a family friendly AYCE afternoon tea, Essence of Unionville has knocked it out of the park."}
{"text":"Been coming here every year for afternoon tea and it has become quite a tradition now. Essence of Unionville offers all you can eat afternoon tea on Saturdays between 3pm-5pm. They offer three types of tea sandwiches - smoked salmon, egg, and tuna and are all quite tasty. The sandwiches are normally served in triangular halves.

As for the sweets there are a good selection of pretty cakes, macaroons, muffins, mousse cups, creme brulee, cake pops, cream puffs, and my favourite which are the english tea scones. There are fruits available as well and chocolate covered strawberries.

I would say the variety was better when it used to be under Embassy Suites when they offered cheese cubes and cucumber sandwiches as well. They price has increased a couple dollars since a few years ago, but the quality of the food is still quite good. Tea and coffee is bottomless as well.

The decor is your standard hotel type of decor. There are three booth seats, majority are table seats. The seating area is comfortable. Easy to find parking and you can have your license plate validated for free parking."}
{"text":"A small dimly-lit restaurant well-nestled inside the hotel; In need of some updating especially juxtaposed to the newly furnished lobby. Service was very prompt and courteous. I ordered dinner which was quite palatable. The dishes were exquisite in their palatable detail. A taste of plain old sludge-like macroni with shrimp (although I had ordered spaghetti-a faux pas!) revealed a melee of several variants of cheese in addition to a subtle hint of ground walnuts. In spite of the school cafeteria-like pasta, I had a great aftertaste and will definitely look forward to the next time! My company also resonated this feeling. Good food. Good dining experience."}
{"text":"High tea shouldn't be all you can eat imo. It actually kinda contradicts the meaning behind high tea which is a light snack between lunch and dinner served with tea in fancy tea pots and cups.  

When our party of 7 were seated, we were asked by our server to choose between coffee or tea, beware, once you choose your beverage, there is no turning back. I made the mistake of choosing coffee thinking I can get tea later, nope, not happening. Our server said we can only choose one beverage and if we want tea, it's extra charge!  Cost aside, he then said it will be too much work for him to serve all of us tea!!!  

In terms of food selections, there were quite a bit of choices but it's mostly desserts. My favourite item at high tea, scones, were not very impressive here. The only item I really liked was the smoke salmon sandwich. They do have a chocolate fountain but it looked rather sad without much food selection around it. 

I personally don't like AYCE so one visit here is good enough for me."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the Hilton hotel. Get the mixed grill platter. The place is usually empty. So the service is great."}
{"text":"For breakfast buffets, regular lunch and regular dinner, this place is just fine. Service is above average. Presentation is always lovely, with as much thought given to appearance as to taste. The atmosphere is pleasant too, with spacious seating and high ceilings to complement the fine dining. Some standard menu items I recommend are grilled calamari, nachos and thin crust pizzas. I will definitely return to try other dishes. After reading the reviews on high tea and Sunday brunch, I thought I would offer my positive experience with their standard menus. As one reviewer says, if you come in with realistic expectations, you're less likely to be disappointed. Another reason I like this place is its convenient location near my office at Warden & Hwy 7."}
