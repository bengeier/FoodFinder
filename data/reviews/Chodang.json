{"text":"It's so hard to find really good Korean food in AZ. Most places here lean a little heavily on the sweet side (I'm looking at you Gogi and Ban Chan), or they don't have the depth of flavor you really want (ahem- Takamatsu). Not to mention the ever rotating players that open and close within a year or two. Maybe nothing beats mom's cooking, but this place at least comes pretty damn close to getting it right. The service is always reasonably fast, even when packed. I feel like this place is primarily a soon dubu chib, and consequently they really excel at soups. They always have the same ban chan (side dishes), but it's a decent selection so I'm not complaining. The fried mandu (potstickers) are the only thing I've had that totally miss the mark. They're deep fried instead of pan fried. Why?"}
{"text":"Luckily I pointed out the super long hair in my tofu soup as I was about to shovel it in my mouth... I tried not to make a scene and told the waitress in the back. They were very apologetic and asked if I wanted take out, or another one, both of which I said no to. It's pretty disgusting knowing that hair has been simmering in my soup that whole meal.  They don't offer hot watered brown rice anymore. The banchans are same for last 5 years I've been here..  The waitresses were okay overall. I've been coming here for a Korean food, since there wasn't too much around the area.."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always neat and tidy.  Good service.   All the sides are fantastic.  My personal favorite is the radish kimchi.  They don't have grills at the tables but the bbq is still good.  The soups are amazing.  And don't forget the soju!    : )"}
{"text":"I'd never had Koran BBQ before, but my mind was blown. First off one dish will definitely feed two, but the verity of food you get is nice. We will for sure be coming back I want to try the bowls. The place was packed but the staff was still super friendly too!!"}
{"text":"Very good short ribs and tofu soup... Great korean food in Phoenix! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean places in town!
The tofu soup is amazing (I tried the mushroom +tofu on mild). I've heard from others the Clam+Tofu with spicy is great!
definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"My first time there. Don't let the outside fool you as it is nice inside. Staff was friendly and took my take out lunch order quickly. Lots of options and I tried their Bulgogi. Maybe 5 minutes later and I was on my way. Tasted really fresh, with tender, thin sliced steak and perfectly cooked rice. It was as it should be. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Maybe they changed the cook or owner. The food is just bad! Don't go! Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I know better than to expect \"excellent\" Korean food in AZ, but I was disappointed how bland the food was here. We ordered 2 lunch specials. The bulgogi meat looked gray, texture was like minced meat, and was super sweet in flavor.  The spicy chicken was much better but still didn't feel the meat was fully marinated before cooked. The flavor didn't have enough depth. On a good note ... The side dishes were good"}
{"text":"Being half Korean, I should know by now that I will never receive perfect service from a Korean restaurant, but one can only hope.  Unless you are extra Asian, the lady will ask you what number you want on the menu.  Regardless, I rarely visit Asian restaurants for their superb customer service, but I go for the food.

My favorite dish is their Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop for the flavor and the price.  It's $5.00 cheaper than Hodori in Mesa and the portion is just as big.  As far as the Bulgogi or KalBi....eh.  Bulgogi is on the chewy side and the Kalbi is a little too sweet for my liking.  They do come out with some pretty good bapchan (side dishes).  I just don't know if they make them all from scratch or buy from Asiana Market in Mesa.  

It's clean, its nommy, and I'm so glad that it's across the street from my house."}
{"text":"Closest thing to excellent Korea food in PHX (that I've tried).

I've been to 4 other Korean restaurants around town and this is the only one that I have been back to more than once.  I'd say we've hit this place 6 times since they opened.  This is comparable to some of the Korean we've had in Japan (yes I know, weird, but the Japanese love Korean food), New york and Seattle (big Korean community). 
First of all, this place hits a chord with me because it is not a cook-it-yourself barbeque place.  While the grill on the table is fun and all, I'd rather spend my time chatting with family/friends, downing Soju and Hite and chomping on spicy squid, bi bim bap and seafood pancake.

Killer dishes include the aforementioned dolsot bi bim bap (google it if you don't know it), spicy squid with pork, seafood pancake, dumplings, all manner of tofu soup (with egg of course), the standard bbq (bulgogi/kalbi, etc) and of course the lovely, lovely refillable sides (kimchee, seaweed, apple salad, I could go on...).

Cold Hite (beer), not a bad selection of soju (sweet-potato liquor), and refillable drinks for the kids.  In my mind, you just can't go wrong.
Service was lacking.  They were understaffed on the last two visits and had a help wanted sign up.  Still, the food made the wait and lack of attention worth it.  They are 1 waiter away from making it really work.

Cons - Its cold in here.  My kids always want to wear their fleeces or a sweater (even in the summer).  Not that cheap.. especially if you like to hit multiple dishes.  For a family of 4, we usually do 3 dishes with beers and we're out the door at $80+.  Not crazy, but its not cheap.  Service.  Last few times, they needed 1 or 2 more staff to make it shine.

Pros - The food, the food, the food.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"This is my benchmark for Bulgogi even after I moved back to Silicon Valley, where there are a ton of Korean restaurants. They also serve excellent tofu soup and cold noodles."}
{"text":"not bad. their banchan was mediocre. needs to be fresher. the tofu bowl was filling but could be better."}
{"text":"Not that I know what good or real Korean is...but I am a fan of any good asian-type cuisine. 

Simple decor and we were attended to quickly (I think we were the second table). The table ordered the Korean BBQ ribs and I got the dolsot (I think). The meat was greasy, fatty with very light sweet sauce - just the way it's supposed to be. The dolsot came served in a huge stone smoking hot bowl. You have to stir it with your spoon to get all the rice, veggies and meat mixed up and a little crispy hot. Not  a lot of flavor but an interesting option for something new.

The sides were good though maybe uninspired. Who knew that Koreans ate appleas and mayonnaise just like I did in the midwest! It was a good sweetness to counter the spicy kim-chee!

A good option in downtown Chandler when you want to eat outside the box."}
{"text":"The menu selection was fair and food was authentic.  Their price for Korean BBQ was cheap compare to other Korean BBQ restaurants. Service was good, they noticed and asked me if I want more free side dishes that came with the meal when they spotted my empty plate before I even have to ask. 
It's my new favorite Korean restaurant for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!

I miss my Chodang dearly. It's been approximately 4 months since my last chow-down. Now I can come back every other week and enjoy some great Korean food once again. I really should try everything on the menu. Today's order was #8 the one before that was #21. I did enjoy the octopus dish... I'm salivating thinking about it."}
{"text":"YUM!!!

Chodang is not a fancy place but what it lacks in decor it makes up for in flavor. We had the spicy tofu & seafood soup with a fresh egg added. The soup was piping hot and really packed a punch. I'm not a huge lover of tofu but the combination of flavors in this soup made the tofu come alive. We also shared the Korean BBQ (chicken). I was a little disappointed we couldn't cook at the table but it didn't look like the restaurant was set up for it. The chicken itself was really moist and tender. 

One thing to note is portions are very generous so unless you're really hungry - share!

I haven't been to many Korean restaurants here in the valley but I will definitely make another trip to Chodang!"}
{"text":"I've come here many times and always enjoyed my bowl of hot tofu soup. I came here initially because I was craving something similar to Tofu House in San Diego. I also went to Takamatsu and Hodori  because these 3 were in a way in competition for best Korean food-faire. This was the first I tried and the one I have continued to come back to. 

They have a decent selection of hot tofu soups  which is served with stone pot rice, which I love, especially at the end when the rice gets crunchy as the end. Their selection of kimchi sides is extensive and tasty. I don't think half of them are really authentic but they taste good so I won't hold that against them. Also, the price is good as well."}
{"text":"First let me say Chodangs food is authentic and amazing!  The side dishes that accompany the entrees are fresh and flavorful as is everything I have ever had here. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that they are always short staffed. Two servers run the entire restaurant on a packed Saturday night and it's just not enough. When they can get to you they provide great service but waiting to order and get your check take away from the amazing food."}
{"text":"How glad I am to drive 28 miles south to this little place .... it totally worths it !!! 
I have been trying many korean restaurant in town. I must say this place has became my favorite ... and it was a love at first taste !! 

The restaurant looks clean and bright, and the night I went, I can see there were a lot of korean family eating there. It is always a good sign !! 
Ordered the short ribs and seafood tofu soup ... it came with kimchee and many side dishes ... all taste really good. The seasoning on the short ribs were just right and I can tell the quality of the meat is pretty good. As for the tofu soup... oh so yummm ... with plenty of seafood in it.  I really like this place as they don't put much MSG like other korean places I have been to. And I love the fact that when they say spicy, it means spicy. I have been to places that I ordered extra spicy but I barely taste any spice. So be careful on that if it's not your thing ;) 

And oh another thing to give this place a thumb up is that you don't come out smelling like BBQ :)"}
{"text":"I yelped this place before going there and I was very disappointed with the food. Their kimchi has potato and the appetizer dishes were not authentic.
The seafood pancake is too dry and thick for having a lot of onion greens. Taste is not comparable to other Korean foods I've used to eat in other places. Sorry, not recommendable place. I'll keep on looking for a good Korean food around the area."}
{"text":"Food is still good. However, the service sucks. We went there about one hour before closing. The waitress was trying to rush us out so that she could go clubbing.

Not thinking about going back there unless it got a new waitress."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ not too long ago and was craving some Korean food.  Decided to try this place out since it had the best Yelp ratings.  In the few months that I have been in the area, I have learned that Phoenix generally does not have very good Asian food, especially when compared to California or Las Vegas even.  With the lowered expectation in mind, this place wasn't half bad, but obviously not the best in the world.

The interior decoration of this restaurant was nice.  Very clean and traditional to a typical Korean shop.  Don't let the exterior, and random location, psych you out.  It'll feel much more homey once you step foot inside their facility.

The service was great as long as the place doesn't get too busy.  We got there a little early and the waiters were great to us in the beginning, but as soon as the tables started filling up, they stopped checking in on us so it took a little longer than we would have liked to get our waters refilled and to pay for the meal.  If you time your trips right, this shouldn't really be a problem at all.

The food was good enough to satisfy a craving, but I definitely miss Korean food from home.  The dishes here seem kind of generic.  It felt as if they just cut up some ingredients and threw it in pre-packaged store-bought seasoning and called it a day.  Definitely did not feel like a meal that the chef poured his/her heart into preparing for the guests.  As such, you would expect the pricing to be a little more reasonable than what they're charging.  $16 for so-so bubulgi.. come on!  I do give them props for the individualized clay pot rice bowls though.  Not too many places serve white rice that way, and I love fresh crunchy rice! :-D

In conclusion, would try this place again some day, but probably after I try some other places for comparison's sake.  If this place truly is the best of Phoenix, then I wouldn't mind making additional trips out here to satisfy my random Korean food cravings from time to time. :-)"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Chodang for years. You can always count on authentic Korean dishes. My go to is the Yook- gae-jang soup. You can get it in different spice levels. The bulgogi is pretty good too. Sometimes the meat is too fatty for me.  I really like the option of getting the greens to make a wrap.  
The banchans are really good here as well and when you run out they are good about refilling it. The service is usually very good unless you come at a super busy time. They usually only have two servers.  
The reason for my 4 /5 stars is because I had Chodang to go for the first time last week. Granted it was 6pm but I had to call 3 times before anyone picked up the phone. Also when I got home and opened my banchans, they were missing several of their usual ones you get when you dine in."}
{"text":"I have come to this Korean restaurant for many years, and I always have Soon Tofu- the flavors are always good and make me feel very content. Services here are also good and efficient. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Ive been here many times and their soondubu never disappoints. I usually got beef but their seafood is also godly. Dolsot bibimbap is also out of this world. Not to mention their side dishes. Im not a big fan of their spicy pork bulgogi, but their kalbi is very good. Will definitely come here more often!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Sooooooo Good!
First time here and we had a great experience.  We had the bibim bap and the beef bulgogi.  Both were excellent.  Everything was seasoned perfectly and had so much flavor.  Excellent service as well.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Saturday night, but luckily got seated right away.  Food was absolutely delicious; great kimchi and side dishes.  I highly recommend the spicy squid and pork!  Only downside is their parking, but definitely worth going."}
{"text":"Excellent sizzling tofu soup and bimbimbap. If you enjoy Korean BBQ, this place is a must. I only wish they have grilling tables, that's the only thing they are missing."}
{"text":"This stuff tastes good. Plain and simple. Helpful staff. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Well, the food rates a 4 but I'm giving a 3 based on service.  Let me preface by stating that I went with a group of about 10-12 people.  I tried the octopus as I always opt for items I've never tried before.  The food was good but the service was really disappointing so I highly doubt that I will return.  Understandably, we had a large party which can sometimes be a challenge.  But the proverbial straw was they wanted someone to pay for a dish that they tried to return. Once refused, the plate was still left at the table untouched but yet they still requested payment of it.  How disappointing..."}
{"text":"What can I say, simply the best Korean food since I moved to Arizona. Excellent!!!  The real deal.  If you like Korean food you will love this place."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. We went there last Saturday. Undoubtedly we ordered seafood tofu soup. It was so yummy. The also gave us a lot of small appetizers. So delicious. We will come back and try the seafood bread."}
{"text":"If you love Korean food, you will not be disappointed! The hot tofu soups are so good and served piping hot with your choice of spiciness. Their galbi ribs and bulgogi are authentic and as good as it gets. My son loves their pork katsu, which is served with rice, salad, and potato salad; and the servings are huge!

We are regulars and bring visiting family and friends frequently. Great place!"}
{"text":"I should order to go kimchi tofu soup instead of uk-ge jang (spicy beef vegi soup).  
Beef soup tasted something is missing.  Vegi and egg was pretty good but Still something is missing.  Simply the Broth was watery and too salty.  Normally order fish egg soup which I enjoy very much.  I do enjoy their dish but this soup is very disappointment.  
For this soup, I won't recommend and I wouldn't even order it again."}
{"text":"Pork was well seasoned and marinated. 
Presentation was good and taste was good.
Prices where great and the quantity could have been more.
Service was polite and quick."}
{"text":"Chodang Chodang, I am back again!

Just got back from a friend's bday dinner at Chodang, and the food just made me smile. I shared #5 (Kimchi Tofu Soup with Beef), #21 (Calbi), and some of Gyoza with a friend. Delish! I especially like the Calbi (baby ribs), the sauce was a bit sweet, but well accompanied with our spicy tofu soup. The soup was loaded with kimchi, tofu, and beef, we had it in spicy, which means you will sweat!!! 

I have tried many other dishes here too, and I don't remember anyone to be not good... definitely my first choice whenever I'm craving for Korean food."}
{"text":"Loved this so much I asked to be taken back for mothers day!!  The bibimbap (am I spelling that correctly??) was GREAT!  I've been craving it!  Love the egg that gets cooked as it is mixed in.  We also had kalbi and the sides were great.  Fun date night and affordable.  We also had dumplings (which I can take or leave, but spouse likes 'em!).  This was a huge amount of food, it was affordable and best, it wasn't too crowded and it was really tasty!!"}
{"text":"The menu was slightly hard to follow (because I can't read korean) and needed my sister who does to translate for me. This was the only con, but other than that, the food was great! And it came with multiple sides including seaweed, white rice, soup, and a few traditional Korean sides that I can't name...
Some of the selections can be a bit pricey, but other than this,  a great place to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Korean restaurant, one of my favorite restaurants. They always serve you six small dishes of appetizers. I usually ask for seconds of two appetizers: salad with mayo and potato stew. These are some of the dishes I order most often:
- Marinated Korean BBQ short Ribs
- Bean paste Tofu soup
- seafood & Beef Tofu Soup
- Hae-Mool Kalguksoo"}
{"text":"Lets start by saying when you walk in, you get a real good feeling this is going to be good.
Went at lunch time with a few coworkers and ordered from the specials. 
Korean bbq, with steamed white rice. The table is serves a few side disahes, kimchi etc.
Tried the fried dumplings and they were ok, will get the steamed next time.
Service was great and fast. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean food!! You won't be disappointed!! It's the real deal! Service is excellent too! If you are looking for good Korean food I strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It's so family-friendly and the servers are always very nice and helpful. There is a lady who works there that is always very friendly and helps my parents and I order vegetarian dishes. 
The food is delicious, especially their kimchi soup. I would highly recommend their bibimbap as well. 
The environment is quite nice and the wait is never long. I really adore this restaurant and hope to come here as often as possible."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic but menu is very limited, not a lot of options for vegetarians. And the sides suck. Ew."}
{"text":"Awesome! I had the dumplings and they came with different side dishes like kimchi and my wife ordered a seafood hotpot. Both amazing with good prices. Busy but fast service."}
{"text":"We were very happy to find some good soondubu (spicy tofu soup) in Chandler. The Panchan here is basic, but the soondubu was good and the other dishes looked good as well. Another bonus is the rice served in hot bowls so you get the tasty nurungee at the end."}
{"text":"Everytime I think of Chodang my mouth waters. I love the spicy tofu soup they serve here along with their korean style dumplings. Their portions are just right. If you don't like spicy foods you can tell them to not make it spicy. I also love the condiments they serve before the meal. Love it!

I like their decor. The tables and walls really go together and you definitely feel like you're at an asian restaurant. Everything is neat and clean (even the bathrooms)."}
{"text":"very good sondubu dishes and noodles dishes. Parking lots is very small and hard to find to park so I stop going there. Also I found the better one :) But very clean and food is tasty. Service can be slow when lunch time and dinner peak time but good food requires extra time."}
{"text":"Hard to find really authentic Korean food that is really good, but Chodangs finds a way to do it!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Really good. I don't know anything about Korean food, but a friend suggested we go here, and it was incredible. I had the spicy beef, which wasn't very spicy, but was very delicious. It was served with these six little dishes of various things I couldn't exactly identify, like some apples in a white sauce, and some kind of noodles, and some kind of cabbage, and a couple sauces, and then some seaweed paper. I don't know what they were, but trying them all made the experience really fun.

Don't let the exterior dissuade you - this is a great place to eat, with some really awesome options on the menu. I don't know if I'd suggest it for a date since the atmosphere isn't very romantic, but it'd probably be fun for a family dinner, or eating some some friends."}
{"text":"My family and I have come in here several times over the last two years I love everything that I have tried so far. If you love food spicy , tell them that and you will not be disappointed. I can say that the food is definately done and the plates are hot, when they say be careful and to not touch the plate they are not kidding!!"}
{"text":"Agreed with the review before mine: not the best Korean I've ever eaten (I grew up with a Korean mom and grandma) but absolutely the best in Arizona. Don't let the exterior fool you; the interior looks super similar to a restaurant in Korea. Sundubu, bibimbap, bulgogi are all tasty. Be careful: many of the dishes come out a little on the spicy side, even if you order medium heat. Side dishes are a little salty, but still tasty. Coming here is a real treat and I leave full and happy each time."}
{"text":"I was impressed.   Service was excellent.   They seated us quickly and we got our banchan first before our dishes.  I'm in love with their spicy pork with squid.  Our other dishes,  bulgogi, seafood panjeon, and japchae was delicious too.  My son savored their tofu soup with clams, I was amazed the soup was flavorful even though it wasn't spicy.  This will be a frequent stop for us when we're craving Korean yummy goodness."}
{"text":"I came to here today with my husband.
I ordered kalguksu-yookgyejang (im not sure the name in English)
Oh my god, I almost cried when i was eating it.
The taste is just right and perfect.
It was hard for me to find a good korean restaurant in Az.
But I think i found one today.
I am sooooo~~~ happy that Cho-dang is in Chandler and I am sure that I am already regular customer this place.
The Best korean restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in town!! We came all the way from Tempe and it's and it's well worth the drive. The portions are good and the quality is even better!"}
{"text":"Very good Korean food. It has to be my family's favorite go to place when it comes to Korean cuisine.  My personal fave is Dolsot Bibimbap.  Yum!

The place, is a good size. One end is long and narrow, and is right by the kitchen area.  You can clearly see it is well maintained and very clean.

The service, friendly and helpful. Don't be intimidated to check it out even if you are new to Korean food. They will happily explain and guide you through.

Parking, there is an bigger lot at the back when customers are able to park."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Korean BBQ and Korean food in general. However, I was expecting the table top stove and was a little disappointed to find out that it was not one of those places. Needless to say, this restaurant has some pretty good tofu soup and kalbi. I was pretty drunk of the soju as well which just intensified the flavors. Definitely staying in my rotation."}
{"text":"Having only tried Korean food a year ago, I am really enjoying utilizing Yelp to find new places while traveling.  This is a gem! Large portions and outstanding food."}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly service! The waiter answered all our annoying questions for people who were first timers to korean bbq. I have been converted to believing that kimchi should be a staple food!"}
{"text":"Chodang? Cho-nuff!!! This place proves that excellent BBQ transcends geographic boundaries and culture.  I grew up eating very good Texas BBQ.  This place was just as good as the best places I have eaten at in southern BBQ joints in San Antonio, Dallas, Atlanta, and Charleston.  Excellent Korean ribs.  Chicken BBQ was also very tasty.  The baby soup was 50 cents a bowl but is straight up awesome.  The wait staff was very attentive.  The ambience was delightful.  The bathrooms were very clean.  Affordable (though someone else picked up the check).  #Priceless"}
{"text":"Been here couple of times. Food is decent. My issue is the rude servers especially one old Korean lady. We asked for something so simple that every other Korean place I have been ro has on the menu (pork kim chi soup) and for the second time were here she disappeared and five mins latter a white guy took our order.. So rude from ehen we walked in till ignoring us. Wont be back!"}
{"text":"I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed.  The food was not good, the service was awful.  They got all of our orders mixed upo. Will never go back and cannot recommend this place.  PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup.  There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place."}
{"text":"Good Korean restaurant. My family enjoyed the dumplings, spicy pork, bimbimbap & seafood tofu soup. It was a lot of food for the 3 of us and we ended up taking left overs home. The wait staff was very nice & accommodating."}
{"text":"Delicious food with quick service! And some decent options for vegetarians. I hope they add some vegetarian dumplings to their menu"}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Arizona, PERIOD.
Great staff, great customers, we were drinking soju and being all loud, other people joined us and we had a giant party with the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great. Place was packed which made it difficult because we were kinda left on our own. We definitely needed more little plates of Kimchi. The service leaves much to be desired but the food is unparalleled. I love the way it comes out super hot and fast. The menu could use better descriptions of the dishes or pictures. It was difficult to tell exactly what you are ordering if you are not a speaker of Korean or familiar with their foods."}
{"text":"So yummy in my tummy. My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always-- very yummy. We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot. We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot. It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey. But overall, awesome service and yummy food! We will be back!!

They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi (spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated). When they serve you your food, they will ask if you want egg in the soup-- of course!!! They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soup...drools. Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork. We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food. 

Today, we went again for Father's Day and our family agreed this was so yummy. We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup (\"Yum-O\" Rachael Ray) and Bibimbap with rice! The Bibimbap was okay but everything was excellent. Our family of five finished nearly everything. :D so GOOOOOD! Going to come back soon! 

Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is the definition of \"hole in the wall\" ethnic cuisine.  It is a most unassuming exterior in the middle of Arizona Avenue, surrounded by other small shops and restaurants.  Mind the sign offering \"more parking 'round back!\" as the front has very limited space.

Walking in, we were greeted by a strong aroma of Korean food and the friendly buzz of several families enjoying their dinner.  The menu had Korean and English translations; this was helpful since I've never had the pleasure of trying Korean food.  Upon first glance, the meals looked pretty pricey but we soon found out that they are large portions.  Our group of three split an entree of Bulgogi and an order of fried dumplings and had plenty of food.  The entrees come with rice and side orders, which included Kimchee, sprouts, sliced apples, spicy potatoes, radishes and seaweed.  

There were familiar flavors and new ones, and most of them were quite good.  The Kimchee was a little spicy but I'm a wimp about it, I'm sure you'll be fine.  The apples were probably my favorite part, with the Bulgogi (BBQ beef) coming in a close second.

I love the small, family style feeling of this place.  Next time I'm ready to expand my palate I'll be back to try something new!"}
{"text":"We loved it! Spicy, hot, flavourful and the \"side dishes\" are quite a treat. This is one of our favorite lunch spots with the folks from work. The prices are low, the people are very friendly, and the food is great!  What more could you ask for?

And when we go for lunch it is never a problem to get back to work on time, the service is so quick. You just have to remember that if you need a server they will not just be strolling by, you need to press the call button located on the wall by each table, then they are right there.

They are not open on Tuesdays, don't know why"}
{"text":"I love Chodang!!!  Craving it now just writing this review. 

I go there regularly, and have also gotten take out a few times as well.  I usually go with the dol sot bibimbop, which I love.  It's authentic (well, at least to me, but I'm not Korean), and comes in the hot bowl with the raw egg.  Yum!!!  Also gotten the bibimbop take out and the portions are very generous.  I feel like with the take out, I end up with 2 full meals, but eating in, I end up with 1.5 meals.

I LOVE their sides as well.  So good!  And they include several with the takeout as well.

This restaurant is always consistent, and the food always comes out very fast.  It can get busy, but it's worth it.

As for the lack of the personal grills, I actually think that's a bonus here!  Yes, it's fun to cook your own food, but then you smell like it and have to wash your hair and clothes.  At Chodang, you dont' have to take your coat to the dry cleaners after eating there.  It's nice to be a place that's not smoky, and is clean and free of lingering smells."}
{"text":"Wonderful. The Bibimbap is delicious and huge. The atmosphere was kind and very cute. The price is very good. I ate way to much and need a nap."}
{"text":"We visit Chodang on a regular basis!  Food is always consistent and hot!  Love the tofu soup and seafood pancake.  And of course, the kimchee is excellent.  Service is always great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love the food here.  We drive out of our way to come here regularly (1-3 times a month).  That being said, we arrived at 8:20 p.m. (they close at 9 p.m.) and they were already closing down. When we sat down they told us we had to put in our order immediately because their kitchen staff was leaving.  I asked the server, \"Don't you close at 9:30 p.m.?\" He replied, \"Yes, but they want to leave.\" RUDE. You are basically turning customers away over an hour ahead of your closing time because you want to go home. We declined and walked out.  As soon as we walked out, they locked the doors, shut the blinds and turned off their \"Open\" sign.  I hope the owner reads this.  However, I am not sure if the owner was there tonight or not. Perhaps no one cares.   But you get one star for your customer service and business practice."}
{"text":"So, the sign says \"tofu and bbq\", which always made me wonder...Finally, a group of us went in to try it out.
Food = amazing! So delicious, great flavors! I had #35, which was a thick stew type dish with lots of meat. Everything else looked delectable too! Sides include apples with a coleslaw sauce (not bad), some spicy cabbage type stuff (not so great), some seaweed, and bean sprouts. Also comes with a side of rice.
Service = terrible. Everybody's very friendly, but once your food gets dropped off at your table, that's the last you'll see of a server.
Can't wait to go back and try some more!"}
{"text":"No one could guess from the outside that this building hides a bustling restaurant inside. The waitresses were helpful and friendly. The food was interesting and the prices correct. On Saturdays the lunch menu is not available..."}
{"text":"Since I married my wife, who is Korean, I can only go so long without Korean food.  I, of course, judge all Korean restaurants against my mother-in-law and wife's cooking.   Since I am in Phoenix for work I looked up Korean places and found this, I have friends who live out here so we went.  I ordered a ton of food of them to try, it was their first time eating Korean.  I was upset when we got the Goyza and I wouldn't get them again, but everything after that was amazing.
We ordered Dolsot Bibimbap, Daeji Bulgogi, Dak Bulgogi, Japchae and a few other things.  Everything was fantastic!  My favorite was the Daeji Bulgogi, which is close to my mother-in-laws.  I will be going back before I leave Phoenix."}
{"text":"My wife like Korean food. We have been coming to Chodang and eat there. 

Side dishes were OK. My beef dish has a funny taste and not fresh.  I asked for MILD spicy but the waitress messed up and my dish came out SPICY...I could not eat it."}
{"text":"What a gem! This totally legit Korean has amazing galbi, sides, and all tastes in between. If you're in the mood for Korean, don't think about it further--eat here!"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed dining here several times.
The first time we each ordered a bowls of Udon.  The bowls were big enough to serve several people. We didn't know what all the little bowls (side dishes) were filled with or what to do with them.  They explained nicely.  Everything, every time has been very delicious."}
{"text":"I loved going to this place during lunch time! This is what I always compare any Korean restaurants I go to. This is my gold standard!  Bulgogi FTW!"}
{"text":"BEST Korean food in all of Phoenix. Staff very friendly, as well as professional. Restaurant is clean, and the environment is modern. AND, they play great music!!"}
{"text":"The bibimbap in a stone bowl - my favorite Korean food dish - was easily the best I have had in the Valley.  The little kimchi and related appetizer bowls were fresh and tasty, and my family enjoyed the bulgogi and tonkatsu.  It was a busy night, so the wait staff was somewhat harried, but they did not try to rush us out.  Indeed, they might have lost customers for not being speedier in bringing and settling the tab."}
{"text":"Let me say I really don't know much about Korean food, and I have some pretty Americanized tastes. It seems like a very authentic place so if you're a fan of Korean food you might like it. My experience however was just ok.

Not the nicest atmosphere seems kind of dark inside too. The short ribs were actually amazing. Sweet marinated goodness I did like it, but the other dishes seemed kind of bland. I think it's called bibimbap the one served in a clay pot, but it looked good, but taste wasn't really that interesting and actually some of it seemed burnt. Dumplings also seemed over fried and not may flavors. 

The soup (can't remember the name) tasted good, but was scalding hot. Even towards the end I could only enjoy just a few spoonfulls of it. 

Not a good place to try Korean food, but if you are an expert you probably know better what to order."}
{"text":"I had one of the tofu soups. Not too bad. I like the menu, and the service was quick."}
{"text":"It's been about a month since my visit but I'm stuck in bed recovering from surgery craving real food and the only thing I could think of was some chodang!

I don't think I've found the wow in Korean food offerings here. I haven't ever been to Korea and only comparing to what I've had in LA but this place compared to LA style Korean food is good! 

Firstly, the only disappointment I had was they no longer offer the stone rice bowls. I get it, extremely hot porous bowls and no opportunity to cool down properly is going to cause the same heartache like when I knocked the ugly duck statue my mom bought off our piano. He.he.he :P

The food: We did family style and I am so glad I have friends who enjoy food as much as I do because they are huge generous portions. There was nothing left to take home it was goooooood. 
Korean ribs, Japchae, soon tofu, some squid dish my friend ordered and ban chan that was all super appetizing!  
My hubs is a picky eater and doesn't like Korean food but he left full so that means a lot to me because there's actually a place we can agree to eat at when we go out. 

The service: when I'm out with my friends they are take charge people. I felt bad for the kid serving us but he was extremely confident and on top of his game better than most people in mom and pop businesses. Kudos! 

The atmosphere: it's cool. I really hope they expand and move to new hip digs closer to me because I'm selfish."}
{"text":"Clean, got here right when they opened, and 5 tables behind us (2 being large parties) so seems popular. We ordered #8, 22, 23 for 3 adults 3 kids. The staff was working hard, only two servers on but they did awesome. Food came out quickly, hot and yummy. Our first time here. The side dishes are unique and we didn't eat much of them but we did try all."}
{"text":"I must say this place is like a hole in the wall. The food is abosolutely good. 3 items and paid $52. I enjoyed the side dishes. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Daaaaaaang! Actually...Chodang! 

That is going to be the most creative part of my review because I am in a ridiculous food coma right now. Chodang really came through.

Tonight, I joined Lindsey, Gabi, Dolores, Jared and Mayo for dinner at the second meeting of the International Supper Club. On the docket for this month....Korean.

My LA friends know that I LOVE Korean food, so this was a welcome visit for me.

Chodang is a really cool little restaurant in Chandler. It's not your typical K-BBQ joint. There are no grills on the table. Instead, the bulgogi #22 and such comes to the table sizzling hot. Still delicious and awesome.

The banchan (side dishes) are flavorful and delicious. Seaweed salad, a nice selection of kim chi, and this apple/potato salad. Mmm.

Normally, this would be a three star business. Everything was A-ok. The extra star comes in for the music they played in the background. Earth, Wind and Fire. Michael Jackson. Diana Ross. All winners. 

Make sure you try the spicy chili sauce. Pour it over your rice and meat. It will dance on your palate like Michael Flatley in Lord of the Dance. Yeah. 

All in all....this is a solid place for Korean BBQ. I am still sad that I was unable to grill the meat at the table, but the quality of the food made up for the novelty. I would come back, but before I do, I'd still venture out to see what else the valley has to offer as far as Korean BBQ joints go."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday and the place was pretty empty.

Service was excellent and the people who served me were friendly and more than willing to spend the time happily describing the dishes to someone like me not familiar with Korean cuisine.

Ordered the Bulgolgi.  Good flavor. A bit too much of the same food for one person but would have been great to share.

The happy service kicked them to 4 stars.

Would go back"}
{"text":"So when I have a craving for naengmyun this
is the place I found to be the best in the metro
area to satisfy it. And no - not because of that 
goofy KPOP naengmyun song stuck in my head or 
anything. I just get a craving for it every now 
and then.  They do the usual cutting of naengmyun 
noodles with scissors and you can add vinegar and 
mustard to taste. They have a decent spread of 
banchan and service is pretty good. The restaurant 
doesn't look like much from the outside but it's 
pretty nice inside. Don't freak if there's no 
parking on the Arizona Avenue side. Just go around 
the corner and you will find a lot more parking."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to me, it's definitely one of my favorite Korean restaurant in town!! I called and reserved a seat 30 min before arrives and I'd recommend you to do that as well, they are always super busy during dinner time."}
{"text":"Grew up in NYC and was introduced to yummy Korean food.  When I moved to Arizona could not find one decent Korean Restaurant until I found Chodang :)

I have been going once a week for the past year and I always leave completely content.

The ambient is also warm due to the wood decor. The neighborhood is not the greatest but it sure worth the trip to Chandler.   

Hands down the best Korean Food in the Phoenix Valley.

By the way I have read some other reviews and word to the wise if you are unfamiliar with Korean Cuisine you probably should not be writing a review on a Korean restaurant on yelp. If you feel the need to post it online do it on your Facebook Time line or write a blog. As this can be very harmful to a business."}
{"text":"Slow service that forgot ordered items. Food is average at best and pricey. You Can get a larger size and better tasting  short ribs at Ono Hawaiian for 7 bucks less."}
{"text":"I lived in LA for 4 years, and really missed having Korean. So when I found this place during a visit to Phoenix, I was pumped! It was just like what I remembered in K-Town. Got a dumpling tofu hot pot and bulgogi. Just delicious! Appetizers were good too."}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum! This is one of my favorite Korean restaurants to eat. First, if you have never explored korean food you're missing out. Okay - I agree service isn't always the best in many asian restaurants but it can be overcome by the fulfillment of their food.  

For you first timers you definitely have to come with a group to share family style. As a basic starter - which is very unique than any other restaurant - is that they serve about 6 to 8 mini side dishes of various sorts to accompany your entrees. Examples might be kimchi (spicy sour fermented veggies usually cabbage), pickled spicy daikon (a white carrot), dry seasoned seaweed, garlic seasoned potatoes, seasoned bean sprouts, and pickled cucumbers to name a few. Not to worry!! You'll only have to try a bit of it and if you don't like it at least you can say you tried it. 

On to the main entrees!! You will for sure like a popular dish: BBQ beef bulgogi served with grilled marinated onions on a cast iron hot plate. Dak bulgogi (BBQ chicken) and galbi (short ribs) are also great options or additions to enjoy, and are also served the same way. You will be asked how spicy you like it too. If in a group, you might as well try the kimchi beef tofu soup served in a stone pot. Say yes to the egg in it. Let it sit and sizzle for a few minutes prior to eating. Eat this with rice. Rice is served in a mini silver looking bowl with a lid. Another dish to try is the bibimbap which is sliced bulgogi, sautéed veggies, an egg on top over a bed of rice served in a large stone bowl. If you like noodles then you might try the japchae - clear noodles with seasoned veggies and meat. 

After all has been said and eaten, you'll be super stuffed! At least I was! Let me know what you think! ;)"}
{"text":"My full review with photos can be found at: http://forkvsfood.com/chodang-review/

My overall thoughts about Chodang are that it's a great \"all-around\" Korean dining experience. The Seafood Tofu soup really knocks it out of the park and holds it's own against any other in the valley. The grilled meats are good, but it can't compete with other restaurants that have the burner in the center of the table where you can really char the meat up. I consider Chodang a sure-thing for Korean dining, where most of the other restaurants really shine in one dish over another."}
{"text":"I'm from KTOWN .. one thing I regret is leaving the best food back in lala land .. until I found Chodang ^_^ .. they have a great lunch and dinner menu .. i personally like the BBQ Spicy Pork and Soon Tofu's .... their Kalbi is good too.  Service is GREAT."}
{"text":"I have taken colleagues from Korea here and they believe it to be high quality Korean food. One guy said it was the best Korean food he has found outside of Korea (and he travels a lot). 

I have traveled to Korea extensively and I always go here when craving Korean food."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Korean food in the middle of Arizona.

Service is okay but not super attentive as what I was used to and a little pricer also for the amount of food they offered. What I did like was the seafood pancake and the bulgogi. Tofu soup was just okay and I would not recommend the nyeng-myun. There wasn't a lot of variety of side dishes either and no tea, which is rather odd for me. I would probably come back just because this is Arizona. Or, I'ld need to wait to get my Korean fix in LA."}
{"text":"this place is pretty legit. they have dol sot bi bim bop WITH A REAL RAW EGG. mmm tasty goodness. i love when that egg cooks perfectly in the hot mixture of rice, veggies, and beef. so delicious.

service here is great. very attentive even though they have 1 or 2 waitresses max on any given night. they definitely hustle and make sure that you have everything you need. atmosphere of the place is comfortable and clean. you feel welcome to spend your time enjoying your food and relaxing.

try the dol sot bi bim bop or the short ribs. both dishes are absolutely delicious and come with all the tasty korean sides (kimchi, sprouts, potato salad, spinach and so on). you'll feel like your stomach will explode with tastiness at the end of your meal. 

they also have the hot tofu soup too which i havent tried yet, but i'm definitely coming back a ton so i'm sure i'll pretty much figure out the menu for ya :)."}
{"text":"They're supposed to be a soon tofu place and that's they're specialty.  The soon tofu is OK at best.  Their hot stone bibimbop is pretty to look at, but has almost no beef in it.  Bibimbop is supposed to have a descent amount of beef along with variety of vegetables.  Kalbi, or Korean BBQ is pretty good, but if you can't make that right in any Korean restaurant, you should close down the business.  Service is ok, and none of the servers speak any Korean which's a minus in my opinion.  If you're craving for Korean and must have it and happen to be in the area, it's a descent place to eat it, but I prefer Hodori Restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered the bulgogi and the dolsop bibimbap. Better value than hodori in mesa, but there were a few small issues with their food. The bulgogi is definitely way too sweet, and the mushrooms in the bibimbap kind of overpowered the flavor from the beef. Service was good. The restaurant seems pretty popular during lunch time, due to good value on their lunch specials maybe?"}
{"text":"Having a Korean mom and experiencing her cooking my whole life, I'm always pretty skeptical going to any korean restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. 

Since it is Phoenix summer I opted out of the hot stone dishes and went for Galbi and spicy squid. The squid had lots of zucchini and other veggies mixed in, which we really enjoyed. 

The Galbi was really well marinated I just wish it had some char that comes with grilling at home or a restaurant with table grills. But, it was still really delicious. The sides were good too.

My one complaint is it was severely understaffed and the owner and 2 servers were super overwhelmed. We weren't greeted for about 15 minutes while awkwardly waiting by the door. I won't hold it against them though.

All in all friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean restaurant in Arizona.  The service is fast, the restaurant is clean, the people are nice and the food is outstanding.  The dining area is always busy.  

My wife loves the bulgogi and I am the biggest fan of their tofu and kimchi soup. It is wonderful stuff. You can choose how spicy you want it and you can also choose if you put an egg in your soups. The side dishes are all great and their kimchi is delish. I recommend this to anyone for their Korean fix.  

They have lunch specials that you can choose from or you can choose The dinner portions as well. It's great for parties up to 10 and you can even go by yourself. They have good selection of drinks as well as a soda fountain. The food is always cooked order hot and fresh. It's hard to go wrong choosing what you want to eat there.  

Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Servers are very friendly as well. I would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I live not even five minutes from Chodang and I finally got the chance to dine here Monday evening. The wait staff is very welcoming and helpful with recommendations as this was our first time eating Korean. I ordered the Dak Bulgogi which comes with rice and it was absolutely delicious. Great, quality food at a great price and extremely filling."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight and it's was not so good. The rice portion for a $18 dish is super small about a cup only. The chicken had a ton of fat and weird stuff on it, not my thing. Probably not going to come back here. It was not the Korean fix I needed."}
{"text":"We went here last night for the first time.  It is true that the exterior of the building is a tiny bit shady but it's not as bad as I thought.  I think the problem is horrible lighting since there aren't many building around that area.  The place is really clean and and welcoming.  The servers were nice and the food was way better than Hodori...both in Mesa and L.A.  We are totally glad that we tried this place and will be regulars from now on.   

*Food = very good.  
-Beef and Seafood Sundubu actually had oyster in it
-Chodang Galbi = it was marinated very well
-Side dishes = 6 totally YUMMY sides
-Rice = STONE pot!

*Ambiance = friendly, comfortable and very clean
*Service = pretty good
*Price = average for AZ 

One thing though...I miss the sundubu and meat combination at BCD Tofu House in L.A.  If Chodang start offering combinations, oh I would so be there at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I was recommended to this place by a family member so I decided to keep this place in mind the next time I was in the area to try it. I got the chance to come in yesterday with my family around 2:15pm and was aware they were going to close at 3pm because I looked up the hours on yelp prior to our visit. With that being said, once we came in, we were rushed to our table and said we only had 10 min to order before the kitchen closes and the person who greeted us asked if that was ok. Now, this was perfectly fine with me since I am familiar with the Korean BBQ menu, but if I was someone who had no clue what Korean BBQ was, I'd feel very uncomfortable with the menu knowing that my time was limited so it was a good thing the waitress told us the circumstances before seating us. On the plus side, since everything was rushed, our waitress brought out our water right away and our food came out so quickly. Everything came out in under 10 minutes! They first brought out the traditional side dishes such as Kim chi, bean sprouts, pickled carrots and cucumber, potato,and one side dish I was not too familiar with and absolutely loved...mayo and apples! We ordered 3 dishes: the Jap Chae (clear stir fry noodle), Galbi (short ribs), and Daeji bulgogi (spicy pork). The noodles in the jap Chae were a little bland but the meat that came with it was well-marinated and it evened it out. The spicy pork was a little on the salty side for me but it was still good. And the galbi was seasoned and marinated very well, that was my favorite! I also appreciate the sesame seeds they included in the meat because it accentuates the aroma of the Korean BBQ!

Since we came during the lunch time special, the meat was cheaper than the original pricing and our bill came out to $40! Not bad for feeding 3 people. I'd come back to try other dishes whenever I'm in the area.


PS- it is not the best location but it looks nice on the inside and delivers on food."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant in Phoenix! Definitely always hits the spot when I'm craving for Korean food! 

I love their bulgogi --  it is a little on the sweet side but it's full of flavor I think! The kalbi is very tasty as well! I can go on about all the things I've tried, and you won't be disappointed. Even their side dishes are oh so good! Don't forget to try their tofu soup as well, so many options available and one of the best I've had!

I wish I lived closer, I'd definitely come more often if I did!"}
{"text":"Of course, Korean food in AZ doesn't compare to CA but this place satisfied my craving. Galbi marinade was good but could have used a bit more char. The seafood pancake was tasty but could have stayed 30s longer each side for a more perfect crisp.  Side dishes were good except cabbage kim chi, which I thought was too bitter. And drinking makgeolli out of a tall beer glass just felt weird. Food can be about $20/person without drinks or tip but you'll leave full."}
{"text":"I love Cho Dang!  The tofu kimchi soup was perfectly seasoned, just spicy enough, and had the perfect texture.  Good flavor also in the bulgogi and jap chae.  The kimchi tasted housemade and not from a bottle and all of the panchan was fresh. Excellent and friendly service and more reasonably priced than other Phoenix area Korean fare. A new fave!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for over 2 years and it was my first taste of Korean food.

The staff is friendly and very attentive. I'm basically a regular. I've been there for lunch and dinner and they sit you very quickly.

I'm never disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service to non-Koreans. They asked us to list our names for table seating. Korean folks came in seated themselves and when we asked about the seating list, a young male waiter angrily berated us for asking why people were seated before us."}
{"text":"I. Love. Korean. Tofu. Soup. A lot. And obviously, I've eaten a ton of it in my lifetime. I hate admitting this (because I live so far away from here), but I think this place might beat them all.

I think my love for this place started when I saw that you can adjust the spice level of your tofu soup. Only a select few tofu places I've been to have let me do this, which is unfortunate because I am an avid spice enthusiast. Obviously, I got the max level, and it blew my mind. I'm kind of salivating at the thought of it right now, actually.

I miss this place too much :( I will be sure to return when I'm in Arizona next, whenever that is!"}
{"text":"Let's face it -- the Phoenix metro area sucks when it comes to ethnic food offerings. OK, well, maybe except for Mexican food. But that's a given. My sister introduced me to Chodang when I first moved here. Lucky woman lives less than 10 minutes from the restaurant. I usually go for their bi bim bop and Kalbi. But now that I figured out how to make kalbi nearly as good as theirs, I rarely order it from them anymore. My sister loves their tofu soup. I'm not partial to it, but hey, to each her own. The prices are reasonable. Oh, and you know an ethnic restaurant is good when you see lots of people of that ethnicity dining there! Now if they'll only try serving some korean tacos!"}
{"text":"So authentic and delicious. I really enjoyed this Korean Restaurant.  The servers are organized and friendly and quick. I cant wait to visit again. I wish there was a place like this closer to me in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great Korean FOOD!
i just love the korean bbq there
there's not alot of korean resturaunts here
but when i went to Chodang i was amazed on how great there service was...
All i want to say is this place is the Good!"}
{"text":"The spicy soup (with your choice of meat) and bulgogi are amazing. Everything comes with standard sides: seaweed. Apple slaw, kimchi, etc. I absolutely love this place. It's easily the best Korean restaurant in the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Excellent  Korean restaurant.
Met some work folks here because it was recommended by one of the guys.

First off all lots of great dishes to choose from. 
We ended up eating family style and ordered a bunch of dishes.
- We ordered Bolgogi Shortribs
- Bolgogi squid and pork
- Soup and another dish that had beef with some noodles.
Rice came with all the dishes and the usual side dishes when you eat at Korean places.  Kimchee, veggies etc...

Each dish has it unique flavors.  All of the dishes were delicious and had enough food for 4 adults.  Actually we really didn't need to order an extra dish and still had plenty of left overs. 

We all said we would eat here again.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, I was a little hesitant to go here without being able to see a menu first. The place turned out to be very nice inside. We told the server we hadn't been there before and weren't sure what we could order without meat. She was very nice and pointed out several options. She brought out 6 side dishes and let us know only the kimche had fish oil. We got the tofu and mushroom soup made with water broth and a rice bowl with tofu instead of beef. She left sauce at the table so we could make it as spicy as we wanted. We loved everything! The Hite and OB beers paired great with the meal. On the way out, we saw a couple other veggie options that looked great too. The verdict, vegetarians go and eat with abandon!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in south chandler! This place never lets me down they have the best Korean food in town. While small and quaint it certainly doesn't lack in quality! I am a huge fan of the kalbi short ribs its a good portion and the meat is always tender. My Fiance loves the tofu soup which he orders extra spicy and then they top it with a fresh egg. Overall this place is definitely worth stopping by regardless of its bleak look from the street."}
{"text":"For a peninsula so irrevocably linked with the U.S., it still feels like Korea remains a relatively unknown culture here in the states.  Whether its ongoing tensions with the north or our economic link to worldwide powerhouses like Hyundai or Samsung in the south, the future of the U.S. and Korea are seemingly on parallel paths economically and politically.  And yet despite that, Korean culture doesn't seep into our lives in a really noticeable way (certainly not in a noticeable way here in Arizona anyway).  But that's changing.  Korean food in particular is starting to gain ground on the numerous Asian influences already present here in the valley.  And with the Winter Olympics taking place in Pyeongchang as of me writing this, it seemed as good an opportunity as ever to take my first dive into Korean cuisine.  Per Yelp, Chodang is currently rated the best in the valley.  On a Saturday a lunchtime, I ventured to Chandler.

Located on the northeast corner of Arizona Avenue and Oakland (about a half mile south of Ray Road), Chodang's exterior is vibrant enough to be noticed, but quaint enough that you could easily miss it.  You'll likely want to park in back as parking up front is quite limited and right up against the street.  Inside you'll find a spacious (and squeaky clean) restaurant with seating for I'd guess about 75 patrons at max capacity.  The friendly helpful staff will find you a seat lickety-split and sat me near the front this go around.  If you're coming here for lunch as I did you have some smaller sized lunch specials you can order.  But I came looking for a full meal as if I were a dinner patron.  I'd heard Bulgogi is a good starting point for Korean food rookies like me, so I ordered #22.  Korean BBQ beef marinated and sliced up for easy eating.  The dish comes with a side of steamed white rice and an assortment of six sides called Banchan.  I didn't catch the name of all the sides but among them were Kimchi (seasoned and fermented veggies), seaweed, a spicy potato and chiles mixture (I believe its called Kkakdugi), caramelized bean sprouts, and Bokkeum (a stir fried dish).  For my beverage, I decided on a Korean raspberry wine called Bokbunja.  Total cost for all the food, tax and tip came to about $40.

They actually give you what amounts to a half bottle of wine to consume (leading me to surmise that its meant to be shared) and its served in a little shot glass.  I detected both some distinct raspberry and blackberry notes in the wine.  Its certainly alcoholic, but not overpoweringly so.  Cold, smooth, and most importantly refreshing.  The Bulgogi was exceptionally delicious.  Cooked perfectly with a phenomenal marinade.  I picked up hints of soy, garlic, sesame oil, a little hint of sweetness in the meat.  Mix in that marinade and beef with the rice and you've got a winner.  The sides were also quite delicious with their own distinct features.  The kimchi in particular was very nice and the bean sprouts were a great palate cleansing side.  Perhaps the most surprisingly delicious side was the seaweed.  I incorporated the salty brininess of the seaweed with the beef and rice and rolled them up into little portions for consumption (if this is incorrect etiquette I apologize).  Boy did that combo work beautifully.  Great meal with a great contrast of flavors and textures, and a generous portion size that can be shared by two or devoured by a consistent hungry human like me.

Shoutout to the waiter who very helpfully guided me through the menu including the drink selection which at first had me crazy confused.  And I should note again just how immaculately clean the restaurant is kept by the staff.  I'm a firm believer that trying new foods should be interesting, adventurous, and fun.  Chodang gave me my first taste of true Korean cuisine and I can unequivocally say they checked all three items off that list.  Next time I'll probably try one of those boiling tofu soups they offer.
For now, I'm crossing my fingers the Korean peninsula can finally achieve its peace one day.  There's too many great people, too many great innovations, and too much great food at stake to turn back now."}
{"text":"YUM! Delicious food and great customer service! A must try in the Chandler area!!!

I came here for lunch with friends and wasn't disappointed. Don't expect an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ, but it has great food, especially their specialty: tofu soups!

I ordered the #1, which is the spicy seafood tofu soup. They ask you what you want as your spice level, and I got medium, just the right amount. I would equate it to being around a 2.5-3/5 stars on the spice level. Like most Korean restaurants, the small side dishes come out first. I was a little surprised I didn't get any green onion pancakes, like I have at most places, but the sides were still all good. The sides we got were nori (seaweed wrappers), kimchi, apple-cucumber mayo salad, boiled potatoes in a sweet sauce, another pickled vegetable, and some blanched sprouts.

The seafood tofu soup was delicious! You are asked whether or not you want a raw egg cracked into your hot stone soup bowl. Always say yes! The tofu was nice and soft, it wasn't too spicy, and there was a good amount of small shrimp and clams. It would have been nice to have more seafood in the bowl, or larger shrimp with the heads still on, but still, overall, a great dish! Additionally, you get a small personal pot of rice.

Besides all the delicious tofu soup options, they offer sizzling plates and Korean dish classics, like bibimbap and bulgogi."}
{"text":"Satisfies my craving for good Korean kimchi stew! The place may not look like much from the outside, but looks can be deceiving. Since my first visit there I have taken any out of town guests to Chodang for dinner and all have raved about the food."}
{"text":"I've been to Chodang multiple times which is kinda funny because for years I drove by and laughed at the sign \"Tofu BBQ\" thinking \"who the hell would ever eat there\". As a friend and I were searching for Korean food I found it on Yelp. I usually get the Bulgogi and the Bibimbap. The flavors are so unique and delicious. I love the side dishes especially the kimchi. Don't de frightened by the outside or the sign the inside is very nice and clean the staff is very friendly. Me likey!"}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday celebration recently and had a great time!

Over the past twenty-five years, we as a family have eaten in quite a few Korean restaurants.  Chodang ranks up there with some of the best.  Yes, there was some unevenness with our service, but everything we ate was good.  Very good in fact.

Like good Mexican restaurants, the outside can be deceiving.  Chodang doesn't have a large presence on Arizona Avenue.  In fact we drove past it, even with our car Nav system telling us to stop.  I have taken a picture of the signage and have posted it for easy reference.

One difference with Chodang, as compared with other Korean restaurants is that they do all the cooking.  So, if you are use to grilling your Blugogie on the table stove, you cannot do that here.  But this is not a big deal, because they do a very nice job.  

Btw, I would highly recommend the tofu dishes.  It's a house specialty.  That's because Chodang's is more of a tofu restaurant, then a BBQ place   As a meat lover, I was surprised at how delicious it was (see photo).   Try the tofu soup with and egg on top, and remember it's boiling hot!!!  The Kalgooksoo was good, too.

Another surprise at Chodang was the beer.  Normally I always order OB, but instead tried Hite for the first time  It's a lager, very much like Asahi Dry and very good.

Our bill for three came to $79.00, including tip and taxes.  That's more than fair given all the delicious food we had.  

Also, while you're in the area, consider going to Lee Lee's Market.  If only to look for some Hite beer.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food overall was good (Tofu soup, grilled meat, etc.).  There wasn't really any dish I could knock.  Serving size for lunch dishes was still pretty large.  The wait staff was pretty helpful in helping me pick something good that I've never had before.  Hell, I even think the water they serve there is bottled, not tap!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your Korean cravings satisfied in southern Arizona.  The place was busy and they carry your standard Korean dishes.  The side dishes were alright but better than none."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars (I'm Korean and was raised in L.A.,  so my standards are pretty high).  Like Mexican and Chinese food, good Korean food is another thing that is hard to come by in the Valley (near Tempe).  The only places that I think are even worth mentioning are: Chodang, Hodori, and Takamatsu.  All three have their pros and cons. I go to Chodang for their great banchan (side dishes). Always fresh and very tasty.  Their atmosphere is also the best of the three.  Other than those factors I think all three pretty much rank the same in terms of the quality and taste of their food.  Oh, except one more thing, Takamatsu has the best gopchang jigae (intestine hotpot) compared to Hodori's (Chodang does not offer it on their menu), and Chodang has the most limited menu compared to the three."}
{"text":"Went for lunch again with my wife and SIL yesterday.  Was pretty disappointed and they are losing a Star each of the last two times.  We ordered four entrees --  A combo Nam Yeung Noodle salad (I forgot the Korean name), Pork Tonkatsu, Seafood Tofu Soup, and a dinner portion of Kalbi.  We got there at 2:00 pm and we were immediately told that they plan to close at 2:30 pm even though their lunch hours are until 3:00 PM -- WTF??  So we ordered quickly.  Within a minute the tonkatsu order came out and it was cold; probably premade or something, and the meat used was very, very thin (again) so it was very dry.  The Seafood tofu soup and buckwheat noodle salad were OK.  The order of kalbi came out last, but not on a sizzling, cast iron plate, so the onions on the bottom were raw and not \"grilled and caramelized\".  

Don't know what is going on here, but each time we go, it seems that they are slowly going downhill.  So we have decided to look for another restaurant option for Korean food in our area.

Sorry for this seemingly negative update, but I want all yelpers to know of my opinions and observations.  We used to be big fans of this place."}
{"text":"if you are a bbq fan then this is worthy for you but the price wasn't that cheap but it's worth it. I keep coming back here. food always great here.."}
{"text":"This review is in terms of soondubu soup. 

The local Koreans that took us here claimed this place had the best soondubu soup. Nope. It was a delicious broth and a bunch of pieces of tofu here and there. But where's the Korean soup without the load of vegetables? We love our vegetables in our soup, and soup is a very important part of our diet. Goodness gracious. 

And they served use a rotten plate of kongnamul banchan which we kindly gave them a piece of mind for and they just whipped out another plate that was obviously just-made in response to our complaint. So we demanded the worker to take that disgusting banchan plate to the chef. But I'll have to trust that this place is pretty consistant at the most, seeing a lot of locals enjoying it."}
{"text":"TLDR: Average Korean food at an average price. Lot's of MSG in the food.

I used to really love this place but I don't know if my tastes have changed or if they got worse. Food is just average and loaded with MSG. I used to get either the soondubu or the kalguksoo, recently went back and got the latter. I was headachey and dehydrated for the entire rest of the day after eating it.

I've heard other people tell me that the food has gone downhill, but some people still seem to like it because it was as full as it's always been. My suggestion is, if you've heard great things about it but haven't had a chance to try it yet, don't start now. Look for a new Korean place to tell your friends about instead."}
{"text":"CHODANG.......DANG, I love this place. Honestly, if you want good classic Korean that doesn't disappoint ever, this is the place. I have been here about 10 times, never a bad experience. Super friendly staff, great sides, amazing soups. They even carry Bohae!!"}
{"text":"Had the bibim nangmyun and kalbi.  The kalbi was too sweet.  The nangmyun was ok.  

I liked the decor a lot and the side dishes were good (kimchi was too salty though).  Their pricing kind of gets me though - its pretty much $10 for everything from dumplings (which is usually considered an appetizer) to soondubu.  If they're pricing premium, all the food better be perfect - and it wasn't.  

Also, its kind of weird that they drop off the check and then you have to go up and pay at the register.  I've seen this at Ihop, but never really at a korean restaurant.  Weird...

I think I'll stick with Hodori.."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in town.  Good spicy Korean tofu dish.  Rice cake soup is very tasty.

The only down side is the small number of side dishes.  Only 6-7.  They are all quite tasty though.

Price range is about $20 pp for dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome service and attentive.  Authentic Korean, the best tofu soup.  This is my go-to place especially when I'm not well.   Nothing like a steaming bowl of spicy goodness to warm yourself up. Sides are delicious too!"}
{"text":"It is the best Korean Tofu Soup in Arizona. I always older Tofu soup when I went to Korean restaurants, but it was very difficult to find a good one because I have eaten really good Korean tofu soup in California. I couldn't say it is as good as I had in California, but it is the best in Arizona. Service is good and fast. The restaurant and parking lots look so old, but inside the restaurant actually is really clean."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here and I couldn't be happier.  The prices seem a little expensive at first but for the portion sizes and all the sides it is well worth it.  
We shared the Dolsot Bibimbap and the Korean BBQ beef lettuce wraps.  What a wonderful mean and we were both stuffed by the end.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona for a work related thing.. my cousin and her family decided to pick me up and let me hang out with for the day before the busy training course begins.

We check into my room.. hang out in the room for a bit.. then we head out for some dinner..

Korean always sounds good.. so they take me here..

Their warning was that the outside didn't look all that great.. but the interior and the food was really good.

I had the bimbimbap (sp?) in the stone pot and it was really good.  It came with a side of the hot sauce so I could put it to my liking.  There wasn't much meat and it was more full of vegetables but it was still really good.

My cousin had the beef bbq and that was good..

The service wasn't really great.. they got busy and we felt like they forgot us.. they forgot to refill our waters.. and then they forgot to give the bill to our table and we had to go up to the front.

It was good.. and if I were to come back into town.. I'd come back to try some of their soups.."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant I have ever tried.  I didn't think I cared much for Korean food before eating here.  The server was a male college student and he was very helpful and attentive.  I ordered the tofu soup and really liked it.  I also thought the complimentary side dishes were fun and liked all but one or two of them.  I am glad I tried this place."}
{"text":"The service was very quick and the seafood tofu soup was delicious! 
I just thought it was a bit rude for them to hand me the check before I was even done with my meal."}
{"text":"Super disappointed after reading the reviews. The food quality itself was good, but the service was horrific and the prices were way too much for what you get. We definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"I thought I have review this place, but I just noticed I didn't, I like Korean food and we have visited as family many spots in the Phoenix area, and this is in my top 3.
The food is really good, the service is great, and the place is clean, including the restrooms."}
{"text":"I like their service, food and price, they have limited selection, also tastewise, they are not super super outstanding, but overall, its not bad"}
{"text":"okay, come here for their tofu soups.  best one in the valley if u like them hot and thick and spicy.  a plus too that they serve their rice in a hot stone pot separately.

i won't come here for their korean bbq as its good but there are 2 other places i know that does better.  but their tofu soup and their other soup items are all very good to excellent.   but dun get me wrong, i am not saying i won't eat or order their korean bbq, but just that its not their strong point, but if we come in a group, for sure we will order it along with some tofu soup for sharing too."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food! I spent some time in Korea and this is one of the best Korean places in Arizona. The pullkogie soup was amazing!"}
{"text":"Best Korean food outside Korea.

I lived in the Cheolla provinces in Korea, home to Korea's best food (and spiciest).  I'm pretty picky about good kimchi, and not fond of the bland, Seoul style of Korean soups and stews.  

This is one of the few places I've seen in the US that puts out an OK amount of side dishes (usually you get six here, the average place in Korea gives 3-4 these days).  Better yet, the side dishes are excellent.  The Kimchi is incredible, and the dishes are all fantastic.

If you are an American, and have never tried Korean, this is the best place to test it out.  For American's going to Korean food for the first time, I suggest any meat dish, especially the bulgogi.  After you get used to the Korean style of cooking and if you're more adventurous, try out the dol-seot bibimbab.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I went to Chodang last night and wish I had some leftovers... :(

I had a #9 tofu soup and let me warn you...don't be scared of the spice! I Was and ordewred it level one....which wasn't even taco bell spicy (and I'm a wimp!)! So at least go for a level 3 spice in your tofu soup!

Order some Hite too!"}
{"text":"Arriving around 4:30pm, there were 2 cars parked in front of a flat store front, windows were filtered black. I was a bit nervous and was curious about the high ratings for the restaurant. Once My mom and I stepped inside, it was well lit, well decorated and super comfortable. On top of that, the restaurant was half full with 20 people. I was puzzled as there was only 2 cars and how the patrons got here. 

We ordered the 2) Soft Tofu Soup with seafood and beef and 72) Dolsot Bibimbap. It was 100+ degrees out at and was delicious.  The tofu soups come in 5 levels of hotness. The Bibimbap stayed hot and was very yummy.  The ingredients were fresh and seemed of good quality. The side dishes were chilled and not over seasoned.

We sat down and spent 1.5 hours there. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service & quick. The food rated fresh and flavorful I especially liked their kimchi! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good Korean food, excellent decor and atmosphere. Serves a little slow and unsure of how to do their jobs."}
{"text":"I made it a mission to try as many korean restaurants in the valley as I can. I have fallen in love with korean food and I wanted to try one close to my work. I came in on a weekday for lunch and was immediately seated. I ordered the nakji bulgogi dolsot bimbimbap. Which comes due to my discovery of how much I love squid and octopus. As a Mexican I can't complain since we eat cow tongue (menudo y'all). The dish came with banchan and I pretty much gulped most of it down, and looked pitiful gulping down a second helping of bean sprouts. The small soup it comes with (miso?) was equally as delicious and the meal just reaffirmed my love for all things korean. I almost started belting out big bang or bts because I was so full and happy (not drunk). This place will be one I will be frequently stopping at. Next time I will try their soft tofu soups with an egg. Very good and authentic place."}
{"text":"Location - not too far from downtown Chandler area, very convenient to get to since it's right off the main street. Their sign is a bit harder to see so we almost missed it if it wasn't for Google Maps (doesn't help going there for the first time at night either so the fault was ours haha)

Food - authentic Korean food - very much enjoyed it. All meals come with side dishes as they would at any Korean restaurant. I loved their apple salad, it was so refreshing to eat along with my cold noodle dish. The food portion was great, especially with the side dishes that they refill for you if needed. We opted in for Gamjatang with dumplings and Cold noodles with shredded beef. The Gamjatang wasn't too spicy so I ate it no problem and the dumplings were juicy and meaty. The Cold noodles were delicious, definitely a great item to have on the menu for Arizona weather - however, the shredded beef in the dish is super oily from the marinate, so combined with the cold broth it created a weird layer on top.

Price - a bit on the high end from my personal experience. I usually never pay more than $8-9 for cold noodles and I believe it was around $12? I guess I wouldn't have mind as much if there were more meat on the dish, since it was literally just broth, radish and noodles otherwise.

Parking - they have a private lot in front of the building that holds about 6-7 cars? Not too bad since you can also find street parking nearby.

*Accepts credit cards
*Good for big groups"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. The food is consistently outstanding, the place is very clean, and the service is friendly and fast. For a small family-owned restaurant, they put the bigger chain restaurants to shame. I have ordered a variety of dishes and all of them have been very tasty, cooked to perfection. Chodang is my favorite Korean place to eat in AZ!"}
{"text":"For Korean food in Arizona, I was pleased with Chodang :)

We had a large party, and the service wasn't so great. They forgot one of my friend's orders and only came by once to refill water, and never came by to offer us more small dishes: Dried Seaweed (Kim), Pickled seaweed, Apple/potato salad mix, kimchi (napa cabbage wasn't ripe though), another type of kimchi, and bean sprouts. Pretty good array of small dishes.

My friend and I shared a Kimchi beef tofu soup ($9.75). and then 6 of us shared the Seafood Pancake ($16.95). The tofu soup was great, but the seafood pancake, I definitely don't think it's worth the price. A couple pieces were burnt, and it just wasn't that amazing + super pricey.

I would definitely come back for the tofu soup though!"}
{"text":"Bomb Korean!  Tofu soup, Galbi, Japche were all really good!  Banchan was decent.  This is definitely one of the best if not the best Korean restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"The bbq here along with sides are delicious. Service is good, and location is great for us. I do feel like the portions are a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"I've been driving right by this place for the last year and a half as I go to and from work.  Everytime I pass by I would say, \"that place looks good!\" So one day I decided to just go there for lunch. 

I took my fiance there with me and I'm glad we did! I ordered a tofu soup and it came out sizzling. My fiance got some ribs on the lunch special. As with most Korean restaurants, they bring you all the little appetizers, the kimchee and the other fermented stuff which I enjoy. 

The food was on point and I'm glad I finally made the effort to go eat there. 

The area around may not look the best but the inside is actually nice despite being small. Anyway, give it a try. You can't go wrong with the tofu soup, anyone of them will be delicious!"}
{"text":"Chodang is a no frills Korean place.  Nothing special about the ambience, but you know you're in a Korean restaurant as soon as you inhale your first breath inside the restaurant.  It just smells like yummy Korean food.

Aside from the plain appearance, the food they served is yummy.  I had the seafood tofu soup.  It was delicious!  The shrimps are kinda small, but the flavor is big!  The tofu is soft and melts in your mouth.  I also had the daeji bulgogi.  The plate is full of tender, well-marinated sliced meat over an onion bed.  I hungrily chowed down both dishes and the banchan.  

With my stomach full, I burped with satisfaction as I paid my bill.  I'll be back when i'm back in the area for sure."}
{"text":"We went in for the 1st time the other day with a toddler and it was wonderful. The outside look and the inside feel is completely different. It's much better inside.

The food is delicious, especially their BBQ's. I also like their bibimbob and the little plates before the meal (appetizers?!). It was also our 1st time trying Korean beer and it's also good.

They have good atmosphere and good price. Chodang is a kid friendly family restaurant."}
{"text":"The side dishes was not bad, although could use some fish cakes.

We ordered Bulgolgi ($14.95) and Seafood Tofu soup ($9.95). I like that they cracked 2 eggs into the soup. The soup was okay, could use a bit more seafood in it. 
I was disappointed with the presentation when the bulgogi when it came out. The color doesn't look appealing and there wasn't smoking like it should. It look like it has been heat up. The taste is just okay.
Also, I didn't like how their rice was kind of soggy instead of sticky. 

The price may be pricier compared to what you can get in California."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend if you're open minded and have a taste for spicy korean foods! Hot mushroom tofu soup was on point as well as all the complimentary side dishes they offer! I forgot what my wife ordered but it came in a hot stone bowl and you give it a mix. It was amazing 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Oh I wanted to like this place so much! You walk in and the decor is spot on for a mom and pop shop and it looks relatively clean for a \"hole in the wall\". Close friends told me that Chodang is one of the best in the Valley if not THE best. We were sadly disappointed. In general the entrees we ordered were overly sweet, which is so far off from what traditional Korean cuisine tastes like. I write this review to manage Yelp users' expectations, as I do not like leaving negative feedback."}
{"text":"Chodang is a really authentic Korean restaurant located in downtown Chandler.  I have lunch there a couple of times a month. I am not an expert on Korean food but enjoy all types of Asian food.  My favorites are the Bulgogi beef and the Don-Katsu pork.  Both excellent.  Both come with all of the interesting pickled vegetables that make Korean food so different.  If you would like to be a little more adventurous than Chow Mien or Chop Sui give Chodang a try for lunch.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Here you will find more authentic Korean food than in most such restaurants outside of the \"Korea Towns\" in major USA cities.  
I ordered the beef with veggies--it turned out to be shredded beef with giant lettuce leaves into which the beef was to be wrapped before eating. This was a bit messy and awkward for a novice. There were also small side dishes of been sprouts, kimchee, etc. and a bowl of rice. It was very good and the different side dishes and sauces gave variety. The others in our group also enjoyed their meals; this was a favorite restaurant of our host and seemed very popular though it looked dubious from the outside and is inexpensively furnished inside. 
Service was  friendly and efficient.
Since we  were all fans of Drama Fever shows when we saw shoju on the menu we ordered a bottle of this most popular Korean drink that none of us had tried before. It is mineral water with 20% alcohol--strong, harsh--we drank half of the small bottle and the host saved the remainder for another time."}
{"text":"I didn't get to spend much time in Korea, but I did spend a lot of time in China.  There, Korean BBQs are everywhere, and I loved it!  This restraint was the first decent place I have been able to find in AZ, that is comparable to that experience.

The assortment of appetizers that they bring is is tasty and covers a wide range of pallets.  The food itself seems authentic.  The quantity doesn't look like much, but my wife and I struggled to finish it all.

And the people are genuine and nice."}
{"text":"First time here tonight. The service was prompt, friendly and fast.
The food was good.  We had  Spicy pork, Bulgogi, fried and boiled mandoo and kimchee tofu soup.  The kids, hubby and I liked it. It was family style with large portions. No BBQ (cook your own style) but Im not complaining.
I think we will come back when we are passing through Chandler."}
{"text":"Alright - I boarded the helicopter from North Scottsdale and rolled into Chodang for lunch today. My wife was insisting that we expand our horizons and try different foods.

This was the first time eating Korean food for me so I'm definitely no expert but I can tell what tastes good. There were three of us so we ordered the #23 which was BBQ Pork. The pork was excellent but a little light on the portion size when you're paying $14.95 for that plate. We also ordered #31 which was like the filipino glass noodles with a hint of beef and broccoli in the dish. This dish was huge and tasty and priced at about $14.95 as well. The sides consisted of dry seaweed which was ok and wet seaweed which was ok for me as well. My son gobbled up the Tofu so I'm guessing that was good as well. The thinly sliced apple dish was sweet and helped balanced out the more spicer dishes. The Kim-che was excellent and there was a radish side dish that looked like thick spaghetti which I really enjoyed. Also, it goes without saying that rice was served for each main dish that was ordered.

The service was a little spotty, you had to flag someone down if you needed your water refilled or some extra napkins. Although the young man did a great job in explaining the menu.

I would rate the food 3.5 stars but the price kind of knocks this place down to a 3 star place in my book. There were about 10 tables that were occupied when we were there and 9 of them were Koreans. So I'm guessing Chodang is the real deal. I got to fly, see you later."}
{"text":"Been looking for a tofu soup place and was excited to find this on Yelp.  The restaurant is a little hard to spot on Arizona Ave, and would have easily driven by it if I wasn't looking for it.  There weren't many people there when I walked in (just before lunch time on a Saturday), but by the end of my meal the place was packed.

Service was quick at first, but got a little slow once they got busy.  Still overall, good, attentive service.

I had the seafood tofu soup, very tasty.  I will try the mushroom tofu soup next time.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't serve the hot cucumbers as one of the side dishes, but all the sides they did serve were very good.

Wanted to take my family here on a Tuesday night and glad I checked their hours because they're CLOSED on Tuesdays.  Bummer.  Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I frequent this spot and must say they have the best tofu soup in Arizona!  It comes out bubbling and then they crack an egg into it and what do you k ow, PERFECTION!"}
{"text":"Oh my god their tofu is amazing! That's the only thing I get there, I haven't tried anything else yet because their tofu soup is so good that I have to have it every time! Very tasty and if you get it to go I feel like they give you more than if you were in there so that's a bonus! Great staff and overall I would recommend trying this place out"}
{"text":"Chodang is right down the street from our house, I have no idea why I've never seen the place.  At first glance it looks like it might not be open, I think the sunlight hits the windows so you can't see the OPEN sign.  At any rate it was an amazing find.  The staff was really pleasant and prompt.  The food was great.  We had the Sea-food soup (with an egg)  and the Bulgoki and both were supreme.  They serve everything with a bunch of side dishes, most of which I've never had before.  Their Kimchi was also excellent and I really enjoyed the flat seaweed wafer thingies, basically all the sides were tasty, tho a couple were too spicy for me to handle.  It's not one of those Korean restaurants where you get to grill your own food, but for me that's okay too since I also like to sit back and relax sometimes instead of be grill-master.  Also I wouldn't consider myself to be an expert on Korean cuisine, though I've been to a handful of other establishments.   Still, this one was very enjoyable, affordable, and had a good vibe.

We definitely have plans to walk there sometime (when it's not sweltering hot) and get our drink on with their collection of Soju.  (Kinda like Korea's version of Sake but sweeter)"}
{"text":"I first tried Chodang when it first opened and I thought it was great. Although the area was run down, the interior was new and clean. Over time it seems like the quality of their food has gotten worse. The tofu soup has became more bland and the seafood tofu soup barely has any seafood. The only thing I go back for now is the bimbimbop, which is still the best in the east valley. The beef and veggie served in a sizzling pot with a raw egg on top is delicious. If you want good tofu soup then go to Hodori, but if you want a good bimbimbap then head down to Chodang."}
{"text":"Food is Amazing, I have never had a bad experience there and I have been going there for almost 9 years. The Nakji bibimbap is my favorite"}
{"text":"Simple hole in the wall place.  We ordered Bibimbap, Fried Dumpings and Tofu & KimChi Soup.  Soup was hands down the best part.  Served in a stone cauldron - bubbling hot and spicy with a fresh egg cracked into it table-side.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been to 3 of the highest rated Korean restaurants in the area and Chodang wins by a landslide! The spice level is perfectly on, the flavors bursting, portions good, service is friendly and fast.  The restaurant is very clean and it's obvious they take pride in their dishes. I ordered the octopus bimbimbap and Manduguk - I haven't had it this good since Seattle. My new go to for Korean, it's worth the 25 min drive without a doubt. 
Yes, it's a little pricier than other Korean spots, but to me it's worth it. You can't put a price on food that gives you nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Their Bulgogi/Galbi prices ($9.75-10.50) for lunch are very worth it. However, for dinner, they charge you almost double ($16.95-18.95) and you get maybe 1/4 more. I can't decide if lunch is a great deal or dinner is a rip-off, lol. I haven't tried much else so I am not sure if it is like this across the entire menu."}
{"text":"Chodang GOOD!! If on the cusp of starvation this is the place because not only do you obtain a grip of tasty food; but it is also served in a desired, rumble-of-the-stomach, friendly pace. Moreover, it is the closest one could get to authentic Korean cuisine in AZ; although, Chodang might seem little expensive, the quality and the quantity is definitely worth your time and your mouth. 

We recommend the jap chae (fried glass noodles with beef and veggies), the daeji bulgogi (spicy bbq pork with rice) and the tofu soup with spicy bean paste--the little side dishes are amazing. As a little side note to the wise, the dried seaweed sheets are supposed to be used as a wrap: perfect for a little rice and a tender piece of daeji bulgogi."}
{"text":"Our first experience with Korean food!   This place was excellent.   Fast service, friendly.  Food was clearly made with an eye towards being healthy.   

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend picked up some random dishes on his way over one day. Everything was delicious! I didn't care for one of the sides, but seriously, I LOVED everything else. I will definitely be going there again, maybe this time I will go in person. I would highly recommend the spicy tofu soup, it was delectable. I can't stop craving it!!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, I have very limited options. This place never let my expectations fall. Good food is all I care.
Ordered -
Bi bim bap : its a hot pitcher full of veggies, sea weed and rice. 
Kimchi (water base) : this goes really good with the ^ food. I usually take a raw egg with it. Cooked to perfection. Spice levels are damn on spot.

Hite is their speciality beer and a must try. Decent ambience and music."}
{"text":"Officially on the rotation.  Excellent Korean BBQ. My wife had bi bim bop, she has never had that dish before and loved it. Service was quick and friendly. There appeared to be mostly a Korean clientele, which is a good sign when visiting a Korean restaurant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience eating Korean BBQ and I can say that I'm a fan. I went into the meal not really knowing quite what to expect, but luckily I was amongst some pros (like Dave N, Dolores G, Gabi M and Mayo B), so I let them lead me through the menu. 

As Dave N mentioned, some classic tunes played over the speakers and although I don't typically associate Korean BBQ with Michael Jackson, it seemed to work out. Moving on to the food though, I had some menu anxiety when I saw 75 options to choose from, but I decided to go for the classic Koren BBQ, #22: teriyaki beef. I enjoyed it along with the \"banchan\" known as sides it came with. The beef was marinated nicely and I suggest adding some of the Korean hot sauce to the rice and beef for an added kick. I'm not very chop stick inclined, so the use of metal chop sticks was a little rough for me, but I managed to get through it. 

All-in-all, this was a great Korean BBQ experience in a very low key setting. The restaurant is about the food without the frills and they seem to be doing an awesome job on the food so they should change a thing!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the places that I usually will recommend if someone is wanting Korean food. I've been coming here for a long time and they always have really good service. The food is really great too! The tofu soups are delicious and the kalbi (marinated short ribs) are amazing! I ordered the bulgogi for the first time tonight and that was the first time that I've tried something here that was disappointing. I've never had bulgogi where it tastes like it was boiled instead of grilled, the only thing that made it so we could actually eat some of it was to dip it into the spicy bean paste that the guy offered for us to try. Love the banchans (side dishes) that are provided."}
{"text":"Went to Chodang on Saturday night and had the Duk Mandoo-Guk and t was delllllicious!! Soup came out super hot with the duk (rice cake) cooked to perfection and the mandoo (dumplings) was also delicious. Side dishes were perfect and delectable. 

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of service. It looked like there were only 3 servers for the whole place and all the tables were full around 7ish. This caused some chaos for the 3 servers and they were unable to checkup on the table.

I will definitely be going back, maybe on a week night instead."}
{"text":"There is a time and a place for everything. Ice cream on warm days, hearty stews in the dead of winter, hot dogs on the 4th of July and hot bubbling soup in the cool evenings. This past weekend the weather was mild and cool, moisture still in the air from the rain which brought out the craving for Soon Tofu. If you're unfamiliar with Soon Tofu, to be warned, it's all about the drama, the taste and the satisfaction that not many soups can bring. Essentially its spicy Korean soft tofu soup, though could also be considered a stew since its so hearty and rib sticking. 

After nosing around a bit Ive found that not only do we lack the ethnic eateries like those found in LA, but also lack a dedicated Soon Tofu establishments. That is until I heard about Chodang Tofu and B.B.Q..

Located in an extremely plain and unassuming building you'll be completely surprised when you walk in. Gorgeous hardwood floors and wood work through out with a friendly staff that immediately helps you to feel welcome and relaxed. Chodang offers your usual suspects of Korean B.B.Q., but has an arsenal of cold noodle salads and of course Soon Tofu. 

As soon as your order is placed they bring out whats called banchan which are several different side dishes in varying tastes and interest. Bean sprouts drizzled with sesame seed oil, kimchi, pickled sea weed and sometimes odd items like potato salad, or in our case a apple and cucumber Waldforf type salad. 

Now there is no need for this but we started with one of the noodles salads, #63, Chik Bibim Nyung-Myun ($9.95). So cool and refreshing this would be the perfect summer evening dish. Shredded cabbage mixed with long stretchy black arrowroot noodles all layered in a slightly spicy and pungent dressing. The arrowroot noodles are like those you've never tried before, Id lovingly call them edible rubber bands, they have plenty of pull spring and snap. 

The Soon Tofu comes in 11 different variations ranging from seafood to fish roe as well as pork, beef and dumpling. With such an interesting range of set ups, it's simply about what you're in the mood for. On this visit #9 was calling ($9.25), a spicy red broth, with garlic, chili, silken tofu with a handful of perfectly cooked vegetable dumplings. When they bring out your Soon Tofu, this is where the drama starts, its wheeled on a stainless steel cart and when you see the soup you'll know why. Its served in an earthenware pot that's been heated in the oven and is blazing hot, its literally boiling. Then the server cracks a raw egg into the boiling soup which cooks amongst the scalding broth. What drama, what showmanship, how often can you say you had dinner and a show? Also with the show comes a bowl steamed rice. Korean rice is generally wetter then those found elsewhere which only adds to the sticky texture. Since each diner get their own bowl of rice, you simply spoon small amounts of tofu soup onto the rice and eat away.

No matter what the time of the year, know that Chodang Tofu can satisfy your inner cravings."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant after checking Yelp reviews. Very delicious comfort Korean food for lunch. We had Bulgogi menu and Dolsot Bibimbap in generous portions and really good flavors. Many Korean customers also  for lunch, which is usually a sign of honest food. Nice service and fair prices"}
{"text":"Taste as good as when I was living in Korea. I went back 3 times in one week for takeout."}
{"text":"This place was pretty decent. The servers were really cool with us when we asked for kimchi refills over and over again. The food was okay, customer service was good, space was roomy as well. Only been here twice though maybe because I prefer Gogi's kimchi more. Give it a try so you can compare and find out which Korean place is your favorite."}
{"text":"When you first pull up to the restaurant it doesn't look very appealing and it looks closed. However when we went inside the place was nice and clean. My friend loves coming here and it's close by where we live so we decided to give this place a try. I really liked how fast their service was. We came in got seated, the lady took our order and our food arrived shortly after. I got the Dumpling Tofu soup which was good but a little disappointed that I only got two dumplings. My boyfriend and roommate got the Korean kogi dish and they both really enjoyed it. The reason why I have this place 3 stars was because everything was great until we got our food and after that they kinda of just forget about you. Nobody came around to give us refills or refill our side dishes and nobody came around to give us our check. I had to wave them down to get our bill."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!

The service is wonderful,  spicy tofu beef soup with egg is a great way to share together before your meal arrives, they serve some great mini sides to munch on while you chit chat. I love the seaweed or apple with onion in a yogurt sauce to cool you down from the spice if you cant handle it.

When it comes to the menu  it has a plethora of great selections  from spicy pork/chicken to soups and hot hot stone rice bowls! I cannot get enough of chodang, I recommend  this place for families/couples or even business a lunch!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!

4 stars because the last time we went, there were 3 huge eggshells in my soup. This has never happened before so I'll let it slide ^_-"}

Cho! Dang!
Cho! Dang!

(Cho!) I've been trying Bo Bite it right
(Dang!) I've been trying to eat right
(Cho!) I've been craving here instead
(Dang!) I've been craving tofu soup
(Cho!) I've been craving tofu soup
(Dang!)

(Cho!)

(Cho!) So show me a Korean dish
(Dang!) All the food that I will eat
(Cho!) I don't know where to start
(Dang!) I don't know where I went hungry
(Cho!) But I can write a song (& Review)

1, 2, 3
I will Chodang with you, you Chodang with me, in my sweet belly!
I Chodang with you, you Chodang with me, in my sweet!
(Cho!)

Cho!  Dang, has been a staple Korean restaurant for some time for many Chandler folks.  I've never lived in Chandler, but I never mind making my journey south to come here.  I generally wait till the weather gets a little cooler before coming to Chodangs because I always order their Tofu Soup.  

They used to serve their rice in a stone bowl, but not particularly sure why they stopped.  Probably because some idiot kept burning themselves (thanks for ruining it for all of us!)  Anyways, I totally recommend this traditional dish if you haven't tried it yet!  Especially, on a \"cold winter\" day in the valley.  I would go with the #2 which has oysters, shrimp, and beef all in one.  Plus, I recommend including the egg when they as if you want them to add it for you!  Nice hot broth cooking the egg with a bowl of steaming white rice!  Perfect for any winters day!  It would kick any cold out of the way!

In the end, Chodangs great if you can handle some spice and pungent smell of Korean food.  I would consider this place one of the best in town! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place gets busy!

Six of us came here for weekend lunch around 11:30am and we took the last large table and only two more small tables left.  Service was bit slow but I wasn't expecting much anyway.

As soon as you walk in, you will smell nice Korean food.  Typical Korean food smell. Gimpo airport used to have this smell too. (before Incheon opened).  You know you just landed in Korea with this smell.  I was hungry for some good kimuchi and korean food as soon as I walked in.

They served six small side dishes to start. Korean seaweed, two types of kimuchi, potato salad (with apple), bean sprout salad, and one more something I couldn't tell what it was.  Kimuchi had nice flavor, I wish it was spicier but they have good nice taste. All other small side dishes were very good and authentic.

We shared steamed dumping, bulgogi, didimbap.  Some of the reviewers suggested Soondubu jjigae (soft tofu soup) but the day we visited was hot outside and didn't feel like hot soup.  As I enjoyed my lunch here, I would like to come back to try their soondobu.  The place I used to enjoy in North Scottsdale changed something and it doesn't taste the same anymore, so this will be good place to try. 

They have sign in English and Korean, yes, this means they have customers speak/read Korean."}
{"text":"probably the best soondubu in phoenix... although it could use a little more tofu... otherwise, it's nice and spicy!!! although i did order hot... and i usually order the medium. 
the bf really enjoyed his dolsot bibimbap... these people don't skimp on quality ingredients! 
and the banchan was for the most part, quite enjoyable - tasty seaweed both dry and wet, apple salad, radish/cucumber kimchi... and some over salted bean sprouts and not so great cabbage kimchi. 
but overall... the service was fantastic, the food tasted wonderful, it was rather affordable.... i'd recommend stopping for the lunch specials (12-3 i believe)
if only it wasn't on the opposite side of the valley...."}
{"text":"First of all, can I just say that the place is outstandingly clean. The service is good. The food came fast. Serving is big, totally for sharing (for 2). So 4 stars for that. Totally a little gem on Arizona Ave. The only tiny thing is the food that I ordered was lacking just a tad bit of flavor. But all in all, of course I'll come back. :)"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Visiting from Chicago where Korean restaurants are bountiful, Chodang held it's own.  Owners were super friendly, place was very clean and the staff was just helpful and accommodating, something I'm not used to in Korean places LOL.  My brother and I had the yukgaejang with noodles, something different neither of us had, instead of having it with traditional white rice, we opted for noodles in the soup.  The bf had the basic dol sot bibimbop, which was just fine, can't really mess up that dish.  All dishes were super flavorful, only thing were the banchan, a bit smaller than what I'm used to as far as assortment and just sheer quantity, but that didn't really break my visit."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Korean in the valley. Been constantly disappointed in my search for authentic Korean since I moved here, and as soon as I had my first bite here- I knew I would be a regular. 
The staff is so nice, the food is authentic and always on point, and there's no going wrong with the menu."}
{"text":"First off, I love Korean food and have had a lot of it especially since I lived near Koreatown in LA for a while.  Ever since moving to Mesa, I have looked for a Korean place that resembles what I had in LA and Chodang is it! It's not everything you would find in Koreatown, but the soondubu is really good along with the rest of the menu items.  I typically order the spicy pork bulgogi (#23), which I love, and the seafood soondubu (#1).  I've also had the duk mandoo-guk (#54), a dumpling and rice cake soup, also very delicious and a very big portion, as is the yook gaejang mandoo (#42) a spicy red soup with beef and clear noodles.  So far I haven't had a single dish that I haven't liked and have even brought Korean friends from out of town that have complimented the place.  Service is always excellent and fast, and the apple salad that comes as the japchae is amazing!"}
{"text":"I am by no means a Korean food connoisseur.  In fact, I can probably count the number of authentic Korean meals I've had on my fingers... and maybe a few toes.

Chodang was such a fun experience.  I enjoyed the food and the company.  After all, I was there with a group of yelpers!  I thought the service was decent and so was the atmosphere... gotta love the music they play!  The portions are large and the prices are affordable, but nothing about my experience blew me away.  

I did appreciate that upon my request, the put a fried egg on my bi bim bop.  (I highly recommend doing this!)  I shared the BBB and a jop chi noodle dish with my husband... we also tried some of the meat dishes and ribs, and of course we chowed on the traditional Korean side dishes such as kim chi, bean sprouts, seaweed, etc...  We left with full bellies and leftovers, which was great.

But would I drive 30 minutes out of my way to return?  I'm not sure... However, if you are in the Chandler area and craving Korean, stop by Chodang and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Chodang...I've been to Chodang several times.  All my experiences here are great.  I usually get the Bugolgi which is very similar to their teriyaki beef.  All their side dishes are always great which usually comes with some dried seaweed, fresh seaweed, radish kimchi, cabbage kimchi, sweet apples, and bean sprouts.  Awesome place if you like Korean Food!  This place is also friendly and is very neat and clean.   Always come here with the co-workers."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic... We had a great lunch though came out like $20 per person. 4 soups, jap chae, bulgogi and kalbi."}
{"text":"Chodang is my favorite Korean Restaurant in Arizona. Whether you are in the mood for soup, BBQ, noodles, dumplings or other Korean dishes, they always deliver with the quality of their food. Starting off with the variety of Kimchi that is served to every table. Each different type of kimchi are very delicious but my favorites are the bean sprout kimchi and the curried potatos. My go to for the an Entree is the Dumpling Tofu Soup. You have the option of adding an egg when they bring it to the table. If you want it they crack the egg into your boiling soup with you can stir in or let cook in one part of your soup. We shared the Beef Bulgogi and Fried Dumplings which were both amazing. This is definitely a place I will be coming back to!"}
{"text":"Came here with family out of town (Tustin, CA and Houston, TX) and we were impressed with the korean food here.  The Galbi and Bulgogi was delicious (tender and juicy) along with the a generous portion of the spicy squid.  Price is comparable and usual like other korean restaurants.  The only thing maybe have more of a variety of banchan (two of them were seaweed wrap)."}
{"text":"Told my husband to pick a place to eat and he chose this place. Upon arrival I thought it looked pretty ghetto but when I walked into the restaurant it smelled really good! The whole environment itself was fairly clean so I liked that. I order a mushroom tofu soup and a galbi lunch special. The tofu soup was super flavorful with the perfect touch of spice (I ordered spicy). The color of the galbi wasn't as dark as I'm used to but it tastes good too. Only thing I was t impressed was the little appetizer dishes they gave us. The kimchi didn't taste as good. But I really like the fact that they had seaweed papers to much on! That's a little different than other Korean appetizer dishes. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Way cheaper than Korean barbecue and you will have a fantastic experience. The appetizers are fantastic, the soup is fantastic, and all the meat tastes premium and it wont run you over 20 dollars."}
{"text":"I wanted my friend who lives in the area to try some bulgogi but this place was very disappointing!  The meat was all fatty and tasted like it was marinated for 5 minutes instead of overnight. Definitely not like the Korean places we have in San Diego!  

The service is great, but the food sucks. If you've ever been to a Korean bbq restaurant, where you grill at your own table, you're going to be very disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"When it's cold, my family come here almost every week for the tofu soup. The galbi is my favorite dish. Service is good and friendly. Also, price is very reasonable.

We checked out a few Korean restaurants around Chandler, Mesa, Tempe area but this is my go-to place so far."}
{"text":"Pretty good korean food overall.  They don't let you cook at your own table, but the barbecue is good quality.  There are limited items though- only a bugolgi, kalbi, spicy chicken, and spicy pork.  No sam gyup sal with the sesame/salt dressing which is a little disappointing because that's our favorite.  The tofu soup is probably the best thing they have here- be careful that you don't order it too spicy (most places we order \"hot\" and here we order \"medium\" because the \"hot\" is too much heat for us to really enjoy it).

They're great with kids- our toddler spills stuff everywhere and they are always quick/gracious to help us clean things up.

Fast service, clean restaurant.  Wish they expanded the menu a little bit!"}
{"text":"Sigh, I had really high expectations coming into this place. 
Korean bbq is one of my favorite dinner adventures and I've been spoiled growing up close to Koreatown in Los Angeles. 

The banchans are adequate, nothing spectacular but they definitely calibrated and increased the prices of their entrees so take advantage of the refills. 

You don't get to grill your own meats, which eliminates half the fun of the KBBQ experience. 

We ordered a galbi, bulgogi, and kimchi tofu soup. The bulgogi was missing the sweet marinated flavor that I was looking for, and although the meat was tender, it was a bit over-cooked. The galbi was a lot better in comparison, but again, nothing special. The tofu soup was probably the best part of the meal, but not even as good as BCD.
It's an Asian restaurant, so the service will be lacking...but really I'm disappointed in making such a far trek and don't see myself coming back"}
{"text":"Awesome Korean! Tofu Soups are the best! Bulgogi is amazing. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I don't remember how long it's been since we first started coming here but it's def been one of my favorites here in the desert! As hot as the summers are here, it almost seems doggone wrong to be eating super spicy foods but if that's a sin, then so be it! During the colder months, these warm and spicy dishes just make you feel nice and warm like a hug from the inside out!

My all time favorite here is the mushroom tofu soup medium hot spicy with the egg drop together with the dak bul gogi and the yummy pan chan and of course the fresh hot fluffy rice! When there are more in our dining party, I also like to indulge in the acorn noodles, chap jae, kalbi and or bul gogi!!!

Lunches here are a nice portion and the dinners are quite generously portioned too! The kim chee is just spicy enough for those with slightly spicy palates but not too overwhelming for those with more sensitive tastes!

The staff are all quite friendly and extremely attentive to all of your needs! Service is especially fast and the restaurant is always clean! I hope this family friendly business will be around for many years to come!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the kim chi.  The beef and pork was excellent. The place is a bit of a whole on the outside but clean on the inside."}
{"text":"Food was yummy. Big portion for lunch special. The pork is a bit too spicy but the beef is really good!!"}
{"text":"My partner gives me hell for loving Korean Dramas, and thought I was nuts that I wanted to try to food based on something I've seen on television, but he decided to give it a shot with me, after several months of convincing.  
One word: Love!
The food at Chodang is consistently flavorful and delicious.  
The partner can't get enough of the spicy bbq pork, he even asks for extra sauce on the side, though upon this last trip it proved to be just a tad too spicy for him with the addition.
My favorite part of the dishes at Chodang, is the balance of flavors.  Nothing I've had there has just been one note, even the side dishes (excluding the marinated seaweed). Each dish covers at least three flavor profiles and if you want more, add a bit of kimchi, bean sprouts or another side dish to get a richer experience.
My favorite so far has been the 74 (I don't want to butcher the spelling of the dish).  The combination of the octopus, kimchi and bulgogi is wonderful.  
When I'm sick, the tofu soups, especially the seafood tofu soup, is how I find comfort, plus the spiciness is great for the sinuses. (Make sure to get it with an egg table side.)
Chodang also introduced me to the JPop, and I have to say it's now a staple whenever I have a meal there. 
The service is great too! They aren't overbearing, and they do not provide the snobby kind of Asian service.  I've been to many Asian run restaurants where if you don't look like you are from their country they will give you a generic menu.  Chodang serves everyone equally."}
{"text":"Which Asian restaurant doesn't serve hot tea?  Weird!  Food was average.  Small portion.  But the 6 side dishes were good.  It made it up for the not so generous entree dishes."}
{"text":"It's really really good! I had the kimchi soup, my husband had rice. Finally found somewhere having good Korean! Most people eating here are Korean. Good sign."}
{"text":"My great-grandmother was Korean and my grandmother still passes on her cooking and recipes.  I'd have to say this place is very yummy and authentic.  I love their Bulgogi beef and chicken, the flavor is spicy and smoky.  My favorite item is the Spicy Tofu Soup - it comes in a huge bowl, steaming hot, spicy and they crack an egg in it and it's served with rice.  Amazing for the cooler fall and winter months!  Restaurant is always very clean as well."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Korean food in the area- not as good as SoCal or my Korean Aunt- but whenever we get a craving for Korean we head to Chodang!"}
{"text":"I finally got my korean tofu soup (sundubu) cravings satisfied today! I came here after church with a group of friends and we were seated quickly. It did start getting busy around 12:45 though. The waiter was very friendly and got all of our orders right! He even repeated what we ordered to make sure he got all the spicy levels down on each dish.

They gave each of our 2 tables 5 small dishes (banchan) with potatoes, bean sprouts, crispy seaweed, kimchi, and apple slices. The potato side/small dish was my favorite. I enjoyed the seafood sundubu (tofu soup) I ordered but it wasn't quite as flavorful as some other sundubu I've tried elsewhere; it might've been because I ordered the \"Light\" spicy level. My sister ordered a kimchi and pork sundubu in \"Hot\" spicy level and it was a lot more flavorful than mine. Still, I liked the clams and shrimp in my tofu soup and the steaming bowl of hot rice that accompanied it. Most of my other friends got sundubu as well. We all wanted a raw egg placed in our sundubu which the waiter added for free for us. If you push the egg to the bottom of your bowl and cover it with steaming tofu, the soup ends up poaching the egg perfectly.

They made it easy to pay separately among the 7 people there by just having us all stop by the cash register on our way out so that they could charge each amount on our individual credit cards, which I appreciated because it isn't always easy to eat together in large groups. 
The only thing was that service did get a little slower towards the end of the meal and we waited awhile for our check because the restaurant was filling up. 
Good place for Korean food!"}
{"text":"I didn't know anything about Korean food before first visiting Chodang Tofu & BBQ, but the food here inspired me to start making kimchi and grilling bulgogi at home. My wife loves tofu, so she gets a different type of tofu soup each time we go. The grilled dishes and the hot stone-bowl rice/egg dish (bibimbap) come from the kitchen sizzling violently, so there's a bit of theater when these dishes are served. 

We love the little appetizers, like kimchi and marinated bean sprouts, that accompany the meal. You get the full set of six even if you just order a lunch bowl, and it's more food than I can finish.

The atmosphere is surprisingly pleasant inside given the seedy nature of the exterior and neighborhood (I always wonder why they picked that location; I get nervous leaving my car in back). The interior is clean and orderly with a spare, Asian look that's very appealing. It's easy to imagine you're in a peaceful little family restaurant in Seoul, never mind the potential for gun violence outside.

This is a great place for lunch and groups, just be aware that they are closed on Tuesdays (I learned that lesson the hard way and ended up consoling myself at Elmer's Tacos). Eating here is a must if you live around Chandler and like to try new things (assuming you're not Korean, in which case, try Elmer's)."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant in town! They make good authentic Korean food in AZ. Food is really good and server is good!"}
{"text":"We tried this place a few months ago and the food was excellent!  The service was not all that impressive.  I would describe the service as clinical if that makes sense.  The atmosphere was very casual with music playing a little on the loud side. I can't remember what we had other than the short ribs, but all of our food was terrific!  The food was definitely five star food, but they can improve on ambience, service, and also food presentation."}
{"text":"Chodang is so good! 

Kimchi Tofu Soup and Spicy Pork are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop for me when I am in Arizona. Everything about this place is awesome. You can't anymore Korean than this. I get my favorite, Kalbi and bulgogi. Definitely stop by for lunch or dinner, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! Which is surprising because nothing can compare to SoCal kbbq, but this will keep me happy until the next time I can take a trip next door to LA. 

Service was great and food was brought out quickly! Ban chan was delicious. They were quick to refill them as well. Menu is simple enough and have amazing bbq lunch specials. Bulgogi is marinated well and the Dwaeji bulgogi has just the right kick! Will definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I've dined in and grabbed takeout several times. Food quality is superb as is the service. Restaurant is clean and portions are generous. Price is a little steep but I don't mind paying for great food. I'm giving 4 stars as they lack creativity with side dishes, it's always the same ones. Whereas other Korean restaurants I've tried have different offerings. I guess perhaps they may be sticking to what they do well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers recommend me this place, and I'm glad he did it! Honestly I saw this restaurant many times, but the fact that in the name there is \"tofu\" I was a little afraid because I'm not a huge fan. But it was stupid of me because this place is great! I had the dumplings and they were excellent! And my family had other dishes that were all very tasty!"}
{"text":"Must go. I loved their cold noodles! The best I have had in the US. Tofu soup was just right ! We had our dose of good Korean food and satisfied. Will come back for sure. Service is also good."}
{"text":"Food here not as good 
I don't like the fact they don't have the traditional kimchi made of cabbage ( they replaced w strips of daikon pickle) the cheapest stuffs ever and no fish cake ! A no no !!!
Ordered a seafood noddle bowl $12.99 but the Seafood are tiny junks from the mixed seafood bag sold at the supermarket $2.99 . Their tofu soup is tasteless 
Never return"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner... wasn't too impressed. The service was horrible, it took 10 minutes just for us to get water.. and for being a Korean restaurant, they don't even have barley tea..which woahhh..whattt...pretty sure a Korean restaurant should have that? Anyways.. the food wasn't even that great, I know so many people who love this place..but come on, really? Hidori tops this place by a long shot..even Takamatsu. The sides they provided weren't even that fresh, perhaps I came in on an off day....what even pisses me off more is that a server blatantly ignored a husband and his wife that was waiting for 15 minutes for a server (okay seriously, that is really REALLY rude, especially when you look at them and roll your eyes..whoever you are nameless server). 

Either way, I was very disappointed in this place, I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm a Korean food expert, but every time I've come to chodang I've had such a great experience! The portions are really big and I almost always have to take leftovers home. I also find that the staff is really friendly and attentive to what you need which I really like especially at Asian owned restaurants. 

The only downfall is that right off the bat there aren't that many non-meat options, but I believe you can ask to make certain dished vegetarian! To me that isn't much of an issue, but to people with a strict diet that may hinder them a bit. 

The interior is nice so no complaints there! Overall a really quality Korean restaurant (it's my boyfriends fave place) and I never have anything bad to say after eating here!"}
{"text":"This place has been open fro awhile now and I finally got to try it out. I was in the area with a friend of mine who constantly talked about how breat this places side dishes were. 

When we pulled up I was surprised to see the exterior of the building. Not so appealing from the outside, neither was the area it is in. The inside was much better but nothing like some of the places in LA this restaurant is based off of. 

The waitress that day seemed a gloomy and unwelcoming with her blank expressions and straight to the point service. I would have enjoyed the service a bit more if she was a bit more  enthusiastic. It wasn't till the end of our meal when we engaged conversation with her that she cracked a smile. 

We ordered the tofu stew, since this is their specialty. I got the kimchee beef and my friend got the mushroom and beef. I like that they have the stone pots for the rice since no one else here in AZ does it. The rice came out a bit on the wet side but I was so hungry at this point it didn't matter. The sides that were presented to us was not very exciting. I don't know what all the hype was about the sides, it was just like any other place but a lot less. We only got 4 sides and one of them being roasted seaweed. Come on now, anyone can cut that up and serve it, I want something that I can't do at home. The stew was ok at best and did have a good amount of meat which is good. 

All in all the service was ok, could have been better if my water was ever refilled. The food was ok nothing too exciting. A good place to go if you live in the area but like most of us who do not, not worth the drive. Possibly a harsh review since there are only a few Korean places in town but wouldn't you think since there are only a handful here and for some reason they all do tofu stew and a specialty that one would get it right. or at least enough for AZ but not this one to say the least."}
{"text":"Went with friends. Saw lots, tasted lots. I was sad to be disappointed. The seafood tofu soup was good, per a nearby taster. Short ribs were stringy. My bulgogi was too mushy, almost stewed, but tasted okay. The condiments were nice, tried em all no complaints. Dumplings were dry, overcooked with little stuffing. Bim Bam Bop went over big as did the soups. I like lettuce with my bulgogi, none to be seen, Service was bad, missed orders, etc. So, I guess, SOUP FOR YOU! Skip the rest. I like others better...."}
{"text":"WHAT THE HELL?? We're regulars no more after our last visit.  Thoroughly ignored by the wait staff and nary an apology.  We will not go back!"}
{"text":"Chodang, my favorite Korean place in greater phoenix area. 

Definitely not the world. When i am craving korean food this is my place of preference. Dolsot Bibimbap is good here. They don't skimp on their food.

The spiciness is on the lower end of my spice preference. Their hot is under the level of a jalapeno (in my opinion). This IS nice though because you are eating out of joy, not pain of spice. 

Anyways soondubu (i spelled that wrong i am sure) is good...

again i am saying not the best ever, just my favorite in the greater phoenix area."}
{"text":"Chodang is my absolute favorite place to get Korean food in the Phoenix area! All of their dishes from their banchan (side dishes) to their stews to their entrees are delicious and authentic. Their portions are also huge. I usually get the soondubu jjigae (tofu soup) and it's always really flavorful. Their hot stone bibimbap and daeji bulgogi are also really good if you're looking for a rice dish instead.

Service here is usually on top of things, helpful, and friendly. They also are really quick to refill water and side dishes if needed. 

Overall Chodang is my favorite Korean restaurant in the area. Definitely worth the visit if you're looking for authentic Korean food!"}
{"text":"The tofu soup Is amazing. I also like the bulgogi, short ribs, and dumplings. Of the side dishes I really like their kimchi and the radish. Service is usually good. Reasonably priced though I wish they would do more appetizers or half orders of dumplings, I would order more stuff if I didn't have to get a whole other meal. Also note that they are closed 3 to 5 pm."}
{"text":"Ive visited this place many times over the years.
Here are my findings.

Pro: 
1. The decor is clean and very vibrant which is rare to find in Korean restaurant
2. Very well organized.

Cons:
1. Because the size of the restaurant, when its busy its crowded and the servers get overwhelmed.
2. Mixed up orders many times.
3. Banchan is the same every time."}
{"text":"Chodang is my favorite Korean restaurant in town. Their side dishes never disappoint. Especially their kimchi! I always get the bibim pap. My boys usually get a version of the Pul cogi! The food is authentic!"}
{"text":"We took my older daughter, who is very much into Korean culture including kpop, here for a birthday lunch.   I was a little nervous as my only other experience with korean food involved super spicy jellyfish chunks.   But I was game to try again! 

OMG, it was amazing.   The food was fantastic.   We shared everything so that we could try different things.   Had the dumpling tofu soup with egg - phenomenal!  Can't wait to try the seafood soup next time.   The Korean spice BBQ pork was awesome and absolutely the best thing we tried.   We had a clear noodle dish,  similar to a stir fry which was good.  The fried dumplings were yummy as well.   

Service was great.   Food came out fast.   And they didn't mind helping us out with some suggestions as we are newbies.

I thought the ambiance was nice although the 80's music was a little odd, but enjoyable."}
{"text":"I just moved back from living in Asia for 5 years.  It's really difficult to find authentic and awesome Korean food. Chodang hits the mark!! It's fantastic!  
Order the spicy kimchi tofu soup over white rice. Kimchi Chi-ge mmmmmm!!! :)"}
{"text":"I love Cho Dang and have had a good meal every time I have been there.  The first time we were there the server spoke perfect english (not always a guarantee here) and was able to explain to us what was popular and some of her favorites.  If we didn't have this help we may not have had as good of an experience.  With this in mind, let me suggest a first time meal for those that want to try this place out.  I go with my girlfriend and we usually get 2 meals and split them.  Order 1 tofu soup (dumpling and mushroom are our favorites) and order the Beef Bulgogi (Korean BBQ).  They will ask if you want an egg in your soup, go for it!  Rice made in a stone bowl comes with soup and regular rice comes with the Bulgogi.  The sides that come with it are great too.  You do not get to choose, they come with the meal so don't review the place and complain about not having a choice.  They give you 6 and they will fill them up if you need more.  They are very fresh too.

If you enjoy the first meal and want to go back I suggest always ordering one new item and one you know is good.  That way you can experiment but not ruin the experience with 2 new dishes you may not enjoy.  There are a few soup-type dishes I really enjoy as well as a dumpling dish.  The staff is friendly, attentive and if they aren't there is a button at the table to summon them!  

I see what I assume are Koreans there all the time and we are often the only ones that aren't.  We are kind of regulars and they know of us as the ones who love the seaweed.  By seaweed I mean the side that is wet and in a mild vinegar-y liquid.  I order extra when I get take-out because it is so yummy.  Sometimes they make a sesame flavored seaweed for the side that isn't as tasty.

Either way, I have been here no less than 30 times and I enjoy myself every time.  I leave satisfied, stuffed, and with a healthy portion of leftovers.  And for how much?  Usually in the $20-30 range for 2 meals, 2 iced teas, and the included sides.  

From the location and the outside it isn't anything special.  But it is a nice little oasis in the middle of El Chandlero."}
{"text":"After some horrible experiences at Hodori, I was very relieved to find this place to satisfy my korean cravings. I didn't get the chance to learn all of my mother's recipes before she passed away, but Chodang's delicious dishes always bring me comfort by reminding me of her cooking. I try to come here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Very good Authentic Korean BBQ.  I have tried the beef, short ribs and the spicy pork and it all was amazing.  The soup is great as well.  Fast service and sizzling hot food to the table.  I highly recommend this to all!"}
{"text":"Way better than I expected!

I had Korean once before Chodang at another establishment about a year ago, and it was sub-par which I chalked up to the fact that Phoenix probably didn't have a big Korean population compared to some other parts of the US. Going into Chodang, I didn't have super high expectations but it far exceeded what I had imagined. The store itself is cozy and there's plenty of parking in the back. 

We ordered the seafood soft tofu stew, bulgogi (spicy marinated pork), and dolsot bibimbap (stone bowl bibimbap) which was very, very filling and all were super delicious. They gave us the side dishes when the food came which didn't take too long. The service was very nice; water was refilled in a timely manner as were side dishes. I'm always happy when I go to a Korean place, and they don't treat me like the foreigner that I am. It was quite expensive, though. $50 for the two of us. Regardless, would definitely return."}

Companion and I have enjoyed Korean food in several venues, and this is the latest one. We arrive at 5:30 on a Saturday evening. The place was mildly busy. By the time we left however, every table was taken.

We were two of the only 3 Caucasians in the restaurant, which is usually a good sign. We were seated quickly, and sat for a while. We finally received menus, but no one took our drink orders.

Companion ordered Dol Sot Bibim Bap ($10.50). This is a dish that is served in a very hot stone bowl. It has assorted veggies over rice along with pieces of beef. A squeeze bottle of red pepper paste is served on the side for you to mix in as you like it. One of the highlights of Bibim Bap is the rice that gets caramelized by it's contact with the hot bowl. Companion pronounced the dish up to her standards and meeting all her expectations. Unfortunately, no on ever asked companion if she wanted anything to drink with her meal. She finally stopped a waitress and asked for a glass of water.

I ordered the Dak Bulgogi ($13.95) which is marinated pieces of (usually) dark meat chicken, sauteed in a sauce and served over slivered onions. The portion size was big enough for any eater, but I felt the sauce was a bit on the sweet side. Having eaten eaten this dish many times in various places, I was pretty sure that it should not have been as sweet as it was. I too, had to stop a waitress to ask for a soft drink. Another problem which I had with my dish is that part of a chore girl scrubbing pad was mixed in with my food! When I brought it to the attention of one of the waitresses, she immediately took it to the kitchen and offered to replace my dish. 

On the positive side, the Banchan (side dishes) were excellent, especially the nori seasoned with salt, and the bean sprouts marinated in sesame. Perhaps the most unusual was the ultra thin sliced apple with cucumber and onion mixed with what seemed to be mayonnaise. Not something I've eaten before, but not bad either. Their Kimchi was very good, and thankfully had been cut into smaller sized pieces which many placed fail to do. 

Other dishes available include Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Beef - $14.95), Assorted Tofu Soups ($9.75) and Jap-Chae (Rice noodles with Beef and Rice ($14.95). Strangely, Galbi (Marinated Short Ribs) which are a staple of Korean eating, are only available at lunch time.

Sanitation seemed good with the exception of the pieces of scrubbing pad in my main course.

Had the service been better, I might have opted to give them 4 stars, but a lot of the meal ambiance involves service, and it was sorely lacking this night."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times but since I am in the Yelping mode, I had to get it off my chest.

Like I said in another Yelp for a Korean restaurant, I love Korean food.  My in-laws love this place plus they live down the street so we meet them here for dinner every now and then.

We usually order the same here, bulgogi, chap chae, and seafood pancake.  Sometimes we will order the spicy tofu soup and the bimbim bap.  Oh yeah, the kids order the pork cutlet cause they don't like the other stuff.  The sides are very good and would be rated higher if I was just rating the sides.

The place is clean but kind of small.  Service is alright at times but sometimes we have to get up to find a server.  I think it is over priced for the amount of food we get but I think all Korean places seem pricey.

This place is alright but I am only go here if the in-laws want to meet up."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service...I am a deliverer for Door Dash and would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"One of the better Korean food places in phx. Their tofu soup is on par with what tofu soup tastes like in California, only pricier in phx. Their meats are also on par with what you would find in above average places in Cali too. So if you like Korean food and you're nearby, give them a try."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! Don't run away from the exterior...its rather nice inside!

Price:
Its reasonable price for the amount of food that is given. If it was cheaper that would make my day! They offer a cheaper menu for lunch but of course the amount of food is lessen too.

Service:
The service is so so, nothing amazing. I would say average, they take your order, serve, drop your check. The usual.

Food:
The food is absolutely amazing. Bulgogi and Galbi are perfectly seasoned and the complimentary sides are a nice. We shared a piping hot, clam tofu soup along with the two dishes for all four and left satisfied. One dish would be good for sharing! 

I would recommend this place to everyone, including families with kids. Best korean restaurants in AZ so far for me."}
{"text":"Decent korean food for the area.
Soondobu  was decent, the side dishes that they gave were decent.
They have horrible hours of operation (but looks like business is good enough during those hours), and they are a bit over priced ($17 for hwaemool pajun?!?! Thats the seafood pancake)."}
{"text":"The first tofu house I found in AZ! I don't know if they are affiliated to the cho-dang in Los Angeles but that was the only one I'd go to in Cerritos when I lived in LA. If you are a tofu soup lover than you must go here! They have the best soup and selection for soft tofu soup. I am a creature of habit and always get the kimchi tofu soup with beef. My husband got kalbi and it was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Yelp!!! This is my favorite place for korean food. Their service is okay, but their food is really good. The tofu soup and Galbi are really good. 
You can save a couple buck by coming at lunch to get the lunch special."}
{"text":"Tried a few more dishes, and was most impressed with the tofu soup which spicy, flavorful, and filled with a good amount of meat and tofu.  The bbq items were all too sweet (kalbi and beef bulgolgi), while the jap chae was decent and came in a gigantic bowl for everyone to share."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service! I would recommend one of the tofu soups, definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Korean bbq!!! Tried the marinated bbq beef bulgogi--size is very filling and super tasty! I will def be going back for some more!"}
{"text":"Chodang is my favorite place in the Valley for tofu soup. I order some variation every time I come here. The soup is flavorful with a generous amount of tofu, meats, seafood, etc. The banchan are also very good; the potato, apple, bean sprouts, and Kimchi are delicious. 

Dishes such as galbi and bulgogi are delicious, but the portions are a bit small for the price. Service is friendly and you usually don't have to wait long to receive food."}
{"text":"I love their tofu soup. The broth is flavorful and I think it is the best of any Korean place in the valley. Their bbq is always good. We usually like to get the spicy chicken or kalbi. Their side dishes are good too. It is a well run restaurant since their food quality and service is pretty consistent."}
{"text":"According to the soya.be website the earliest recorded reference to Tofu is in the poem Ode to Tofu, written at the end of the 15th century, in 1500 AD. Well, a bit over 500 years later, I have to say that my experience at Chodang makes me also want to wax eloquent on the joys of solidified bean curd, or what we know as the humble tofu.

I've had Tofu before, and tofu in miso soup but never Korean style Miso soup. I'd given blood and decided I needed something to invigorate my depleted blood supply and some Kim-Chee soup with beef seemed just the ticket. The nice thing about Chodang, it follows the Korean meal practice of setting out a number of small savory dishes, often with a mix of pickled vegies, and then bringing out the main course, which in this case was a bubbling hot bowl of soup, which the wait person will happily crack a raw egg into, which I recommend, and a side of rice. 

I ordered the soup a four on a  four out of five scale as my one time having truly Thai hot Thai food has made me wary of going for the top of the scale the first time in a restaurant. In  this case, if you like spicy, for four a 5 out of 5 level as the 4 out of 5 didn't seem all that spicey. However, I did love the tofu in the soup, they seemed to use a soft tofu which sort of breaks off in ragged chunks and was wonderful in the soup which was thick with kim-chee and had a number of thin slices of beef included. 

I do hope to come back again and follow the advice of Lester C (excellent reviewer of all things Asian, he has never steered my wrong so a shout out to my fellow elite Yelper) and try the Korean BBQ. I saw a plate of Korean short rips go by and they ,looked, as they say in Hawaii, Ono! It is a bit out of the way from where I live but only a few miles from the United Blood bank in Chandler so go do some good, give some blood and then reward yourself with a visit to this lovely Korean restaurant.

P.S. - only weird thing, they serve the hot tea, which is more like warm team, in a large, plastic water glass, blah. Spif it up a bit Chodang and provide a teapot and a small cup for green tea. It won't cost much and adds to the experience.:-)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner one night and had a pretty good experience. Korean food can be tricky... depending on the area you're in they may or may not serve some more esoteric (and delicious) dishes- some of which are must-haves for me to be able to really enjoy a good Korean meal. Sikhye being one of them (a rice dessert drink)- for some reason a Korean meal just doesn't seem to end right for me without it. I love Korean fish dishes, and hwe dup bap is another go-to for me. Their selections of banchan were good, and fairly typical for a good Korean resaurant. We had bi bim bap and another hot stone-pot dish which I can't really recall, as well as some steamed dumplings. Everything was fine- nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either. 

I really hate to be one of those \"I've had better\" snobs, but I have. However, for someone who was just curious about Korean food and wanted to try something which would serve as a good introduction, you could do a lot worse than Chodang."}
{"text":"Korean short ribs, unbelievable tofu soups. First rate Korean food. A must try."}
{"text":"First time I had Korean food. It was definitely different for me. My fiancé has has korean in south korea and said this food was almost identical to flavor. Since it was my first time is was something new that will grow on me. Therefore, the portion size of the entrées were massive! My rice bowl could have fed two people. I was disappointed that my rice bowl was sizzling hot still 30 minutes after they served me and it was hard to eat. It was delicious flavors and the paste gave it a great kick. Definitely would recommend this location for korean. Very good food, awesome service and large portions."}
{"text":"My first time in an authentic Korean restaurant. Food was excellent with healthy size portions"}
{"text":"This is my to-go place in Arizona when I crave for Korean food. I lived in Korea for a while and trust me this is THE place if you want to have authentic Korean food. Delicious food and a very friendly atmosphere. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite korean eatery. Have tried a variety of their tofu soup and love them all, the broth is very flavorful. Also tried several other dishes here (seafood noodle soup, japchae, bulgogi, bibimbap, seafood pancake, etc) and have always been satisfied with their flavor and portion size. 

However, their side dishes are not as good as Gogi's. I also like the taste of Gogi's kimchi  better than Chodang's. Prices are a little higher than other korean restaurants in town. 

Would be nice if they offer lunch special like Gogi."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night with the hubs. We both loved it! We shared the seafood tofu soup and dolsot bibimbop. I was reluctant to try the seafood tofu soup (as I don't always trust AZ seafood) but decided to live life on the edge and went for it! So glad I did because it was amazing and spicy; none of that wimp spice too many places serve up. Just beware that parking is limited, but it wasn't too busy when I went so no problem there!"}
{"text":"this place has been around as far back as i can remember and as a matter of fact there aren't to many Korean places around they are now starting to open up all around the valley. this place runs a tight crew they don't waste any time in getting you seated and served. i just love their menu because there is a lot to choose from anything from soups to dumplings to noodles and rice, they have it all here. you get a lot of food for your buck and i can guarantee you that you will leave there satisfied."}
{"text":"Can't wait to return and try more of the menu. I had the Korean marinated bbq and it was delish. I went in during lunch and was so happy with the portions- it was perfect. Not too much but I was full when I left. Rice was perfectly sticky. The sides we yummy too. There was some kind of Apple salad type dish I've never had before for a side and it was almost like dessert. Glad to know this place is down the street from my home . I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times now and its consistently great food and service. Crave it everyday."}
{"text":"I love this place.... I have to say it's always in my top 2 choices of Korean restaurants . I love the staff they are quick and great. The food is always on point. I have never been upset with anything I have ordered from here. Side dishes are always perfect too!"}
{"text":"The Tofu Soup is amazing.. that alone carries this restaurant to the four stars.  If you love food as much as i do, it will help you overlook the extremely overbearing AC vents that sometimes pound down upon you all year long, or the service that is catered towards the more \"ethnic\" (cough korean cough) patrons.  example : i walked in with my party, and they told me to wait because they have to clean some tables, a group of ethnic individuals walked in.. waited behind us for a little bit, then walked over and spoke in korean to the other staff member and were sat down before us.  so yeah.. i was upset but did not mind after i had the taste of their yummy soup again."}
{"text":"Not the best quality of Korean food I've had in the area. However, this place has the best service out of all the Korean restaurants I've been to and that speaks volumes. Additionally, they have the best and most consistent side dishes compared to other Korean places in Arizona. The outside may not look like much, but the inside is definitely inviting with their comfortable decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm finally reviewing Chodang - my favorite Korean restaurant :) I can never get enough seafood tofu soup and galbi, but our stomachs are always bursting when we leave!"}
{"text":"Perfectly acceptable Korean food.  

We've been pretty disappointed with most of the Korean food around town, which has ranged from mediocre and expensive (Hodori) to awful and expensive (Red Kimchi/Korean Restaurant) to just generally mediocre (Takematsu).

Chodang was reasonably priced and not bad at all.  Make no mistake - this ain't LA's Koreatown - but it's the only place we've found that's at all acceptable.

We had six panchan to start which were decent if not inspired then a pretty big portion of galbi, a nice seafood soon dobu and a seafood pajeon.  The galbi was quite nice, the soon dobu was perfect and the pajeon was good, but a bit odd, more like a 2 inch thick frittata than a traditional pajeon.

About $50 for a big meal for three people. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after craving something warm for the cold weather.  We have been to a few other korean places where I was disappointed in the tofu and bbq.  This place is as good as it gets for korean tofu in AZ! We got a soon tofu and spicy pork.  

Pan chan (sides)- Yummy kimchi and potatoes 
Seafood&beef tofu-  Amazing flavor and lots of clams!! 
Spicy pork-  So flavorful and amazing ! 

Come here for the best korean food in the east valley! I'm pretty sure I will soon become a regular even though its quite a drive."}
{"text":"This restaurant in a scary part of town is really great. My go to dish is usually a tofu soup or dolsot bibimbap. They are excellent. My only reason for downgrading from 5 stars is that they will not add the raw egg to your boiling tofu soup and have a little notice on the top of their menu about it. The banchan here are very good. They have kalbi and bulgogi but it is not grill your own. I have seen many koreans in this restaurant and that is always a good sign."}
{"text":"I haven't ever had the BBQ meats here because the other Korean dishes Chodang offers are really good.  The ba bim bop is has really fresh ingredients and comes in a normal temp dish or a stone pot.  I recommend getting the one that comes in the stone pot.  

I normally eat the spicy pork soup or tofu soup and both of these dishes are offered in a varying degree of spicy between 1 and 5.  They're supposed to be served relatively spicy so go with a 3 or higher if you can handle it.  Also he soups come piping hot to your granite table and the server will ask if you want an egg added - if you're \"ok\" with eggs but not sure if it'll taste good with your soup- just say \"yes\".  Trust me.

The pun chun  (the small dishes of food they bring to you before the meal) is pretty good.  The kimchee is hit and miss but often times it tastes good.  The other dishes seem to vary depending on what they have available but for the most part it's all quite tasty.

I've only eaten here for dinner but I've eaten here often and know that the food is consistently good.  Everyone I've brought with me to this place loves it.  

Special note: Slow down and approach at an angle when you drive into the parking lot - it's kinda steep and bumpy."}
{"text":"The only place to go for Korean in the area.  If you can do the gangnam style dance, you get 20% off. :)"}
{"text":"Way betta then thee Hodori 5 miles away.

They have good banchan (sides) as well as overall goodness with the usual Sundubu and Jaeyuk Bokkeum. (Pork Stir Fry)

I'd say Cafe Ga-Hyang and Chodang are the 2 best Korean restaurants in K-Restaurant Deprived Phoenix. ~ (Sadly the two best also demand a bit of a premium in terms of price point esp. compared to LA )"}
{"text":"I hate giving Chodang 3 stars when I know I'm going to become a regular, but I've had truly outstanding Korean food in my lifetime in Seattle, San Jose, and Flushing and just can't pull 4 stars out of my hat this time.

The tofu soup was exactly right.  The Kalbi could have been a little more tender, but the flavor was perfect.  And I really enjoyed the generous side dishes.  I do hope they expand their menu to include more of the traditional Korean casseroles."}
{"text":"Still the very best Korean joint I can find. After going here for two years you think I would have completed a review. But I wanted to be the only white dude in this place! Then I found it won best soup in Phoenix Magazine! Oh no the secret is out! I wish the oyster soup would leave the menu or simply stop tempting me and not having it."}
{"text":"This is the place for Korean jjigae - spicy tofu soup in a little black cauldron.  Unlimited side dishes - I like the dried and pickled seaweed, the soy sauce Mung bean sprouts, the vinegar skinny radish kimchi, and the spicy regular kimchi (not the best, but one of the spiciest).  Most tofu soups here are around $10, and you're eating it to the sound of some 90's tunes.  But the hot tofu soup is the best.  I like the mushroom kind.  Not sure about the other dishes, but Chodang is a great place to go if you're near the 202 south or anywhere near Chandler Mall."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this place on a Saturday night. That being said, my service tonight was better than my first visit. Oh what a difference an hour makes. There are only 2 servers for this place on a Saturday night and they are busy, like crazy busy. The busyness is understandable given that the food here is amazing. 
I was greeted and seated promptly. I was given water and 6 little side dishes to snack on while waiting on my meal, they consisted of an apple salad, 2 types of kimchi, bean sprouts,  pickled daikon radish, seaweed paper and a spicy potato dish.  I ordered a number 21 Galbi which is served on a large platter with sliced onions underneath. First off, all the little sides were filled with flavor and each one different in taste and texture. The galbi was marinated and flame grilled perfectly. Not one piece came out burnt. Hands down, absolutely delicious. I also tried their Bohae which is a Korean black raspberry wine. It was a little too sweet for my everyday taste but it went with my meal perfectly. 
I would say that compared to places that allow you to cook at the table this place is better. The chefs in the kitchen know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Korean food this is it. Chodang is one of, or even may be thee best, Korean BBQ places I have ever experienced. Their BBQ pork and beef tastes like it has been marinated for days, so delicious. Another awesome choice are their Babimbop bowls. Oh my goodness, you cannot go wrong because whatever you order will be absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for authentic Korean food in the east valley. From the moment you walk in it smells, looks, and feels like I'm back in Korea. Everything I have tried has been amazing, and I'll definitely be back regularly for my hanguk shikdang fix."}
{"text":"It had been awhile since we had Korean food, so yesterday we headed over to Chodang. Had it not been for Yelp, I would not have known it was there. I'm glad to find it. 

It's a fairly small place compared to other restaurants like Takamatsu in Chandler, but not too small. Kinda cozy I guess. Anyway, we ordered the bulgogi dinner plate (about $14.00), the bulgogi lunch plate ($8.50) and bibimbap. They messed up our order a little though, and the bulgogi lunch plate ended up being kalbi, but that was okay. Actually, the kalbi was better than the bulgogi. The portions were a decent size, at least average with the dinner plate being above average. 

Other reviewers have said this is the best Korean food in Phoenix. I cannot agree with that. I have had better. However, this was pretty darn good. The bulgogi was about average, but the kalbi was very good. My wife also enjoyed the bibimbap. As is customary, they brought out the usual assortment of kim chi and other side dishes, and that was all great. We discovered that our 2 year old loves kim/nori! He ended up eating three servings of the stuff! 

Other than messing up our order, which was a blessing in disguise, the service was very good and friendly. Even though this is not the best Korean food in town, it was good enough. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The service is really fast. The prices are good. Tofu soups run around $9. The bipimbap and the bbq is a deal compared to other Korean places as it is around $11 and $13. The side dishes are good. I don't care for the apple mayo thing they got going on. Korean restaurants should stick with Korean side dishes. I love how their rice comes in stone pots."}
{"text":"Sad to say, I don't really understand the hype.  Maybe I just didn't get a dish that satisfied my Korean BBQ craving... I ordered the BBQ Bulgogi for $13.95 and thought it was A-OK. Additionally, the side dishes did not WOW me either. Kimchi wasn't as spicy or maybe it wasn't fermented too long? I did like how the sea weed wasn't too salty. Maybe next time if they throw anchovies and rice cake on their side dishes, I'd be impressed. I really wanted to like this place and recommend it as the #1 place in Az, but I just didn't have a overall satisfying feeling. I'll have to give this place another try and see if I feel the same way."}
{"text":"As you enter note the three kimchee earthen jars on display. That's what they used in the past to store kimchee in the cold ground during winter. This was before fridges especially for kimchee were made. 

Good Korean food as testified by my Korean friend whom I was with. It was great that they could adjust the heat of the soondubu (tofu stew) according to your tolerance level. The dolsot bibimbap was good too with enough sesame oil. When I'm next in town, I would be back."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best place in Phoenix. I have tried them all and keep coming back here. The servers are the sweetest girls in town, very generous with the side dishes and eager to make sure you are happy with your dining experience. I have tried most of their dishes and have never never had bad luck with any of them. They are tasty, hot, fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes Korean food or is interested in trying it for the first time. It will be a good experience,  guaranteed!!!"}

{"text":"Love the soup here. When you ask for spicy you get spicy. They crack a raw egg into the soup when they bring it out because the soups are served in clay pots which is still bubbling hot. You have the soup with a side of rice. This is usually all I need, because it's filling. My son loves the Korean spare ribs so he gets those and the fried dumplings which are ok. Definitely the spot if you feeling soup. I love the little trays of appetizers they bring out before your food. It consist of kimchi, seaweed, sweet potatoes, sweet apples, pickled bean sprouts and pickled some sort of root I think which is all good. 
The service is quick and they are on point even when the whole place is full."}
{"text":"tasty.  super delicious, local...what's not to like?  i've been back many times since.  it's chodang good."}
{"text":"I'm crying!  A little research on my reviews will show you my love from a place in my hometown in CA called lees tofu, and this place is the identical twin.  Right down to the menu.  I'm ordering the mushroom soon and the bulgogi.  If it's the same, even through my tears, I will just I love it.  If I update my review...it's to be mean."}
{"text":"I would say it's a decent place for Korean dishes. Can't find any disadvantages. If need to name one might be the price. It's a little bit higher than other Korean places. And the location is a little bit far and not that convenience compare to other places."}
{"text":"This place is super busy- which was a good sign for our first visit. We waited for about 30 minutes for a table which was okay, but there wasn't a designated waiting area so we were crammed over by the drink station. When we got to a table we realized we had NO IDEA what any of the food was, so we just took a stab in the dark and ordered a few different things off the menu. The mushroom tofu soup was absolutely amazing and I could eat it all day everyday forever. So. Good. I also had the tofu nuggets, which were good but boring. My husband had a meat dish which he seemed to enjoy very much. Definitely recommend- and you have to try the soup! We will be back after some further research into what the foods are so we walk in knowing what we want."}
{"text":"So far the best Korean Restaurant I have ever been in!! 
Food was great and service was great! 
Will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"After going back to this place for a second try, the food and service was much better.  Portion size was great! Enjoy all the side dishes."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Chodang since it is one of the most authentic restaurants in the valley, recommend BBQ beef, cold noodles. You would love it for sure."}
{"text":"Bomb.com


If you like Korean you will be very impressed with this place.

Pretty much everything we had here was absolutely fantastic as well as the service. Do not let the outside for you. This is a very nice restaurant inside. 

Try the Dol Cet Bim Bim Bap with egg and a plate of spicy pork. Ask for the hot sauce and be prepared to enjoy the hell out of yourself.

Keep in mind these foods are all best when mixed together!!!"}
{"text":"Great Korean in the valley of the sun! If you're looking for authentic Korean stews and BBQ Korean short ribs, this place is the place to be. I recommend the soon tofu soup with mixes seafood, so bomb!"}
{"text":"Finally brought the Wife here for lunch. I had the Bulgogi Special. And wife had a Tofu Soup that she loved.. She is usually very picky when it comes to Asian cuisine. We will definitely be back. All the food we have tried so far has been consistent and Very good quality. Prices are a tad bit high, but well worth the quality of food. Each time I have been there, the service is great as well."}
{"text":"Definitely one if my favorite Korean restaurants in town. The galbi and kimchi tofu soup are awesome. I love their spicy pork dish as well. Service is not the best but just because they are always packed. You definitely get your moneys worth here."}
{"text":"Such friendly and fast service!  Food came piping hot and was bursting with flavor.  I was very happy with our visit.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We are a fan of this place for lunch as it is way less pricier than dinner.

Love the little salad apps that come out before - the apple one is my favorite. Love the BBQ and bibimbop, flavorful and the egg is always cooked just right. The service can be really packed on a Friday lunch so get there early to avoid long food wait times. The good thing is there are quite a few asian folks that dine there so you know it's good!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but delicious Korean food. I enjoy the tofu soup. My family like the spicy chicken bulgogi but my boyfriend says it doesnt taste like much. Id go just for the soup tbh. Sides are good. Kimchi is not  spicy at all. The meats are good. Kalbi is one of my favorite dishes. I don't hate it here."}
{"text":"Great Korean food for the phoenix valley area.  We ordered BULGOGI and JAP CHAE.  The price was decent and the portion was huge.  Very clean and fast service."}
{"text":"Fresh, great quality ingredients. Each side dish had a distinct flavor. Although nothing was \"vegetarian\" on the menu, they were able to alter a few dishes to make them vegetarian. I truly enjoyed my stone pot bibimbap!"}
{"text":"Really traditional Korean food :) Reminds me the Seafood Tofu soup I've had in Seoul."}
{"text":"[Right at about 3.5 stars for food and service.] 

Finding myself here as the first to join of group of Yelpers at their international supper, the restaurant was ready for the 15 or so that had said they were \"IN\" .  They were anxiously awaiting our arrival.  Slowly a few more wander in 6 in all.  They were ready, releaved yet slightly disapointed that more didn't show.  

I found the sides/banchan to be good and plentiful, the kimchee and the dakon radish were very good as was an apple salad that tasted much like a waldorf salad with a mayo dressing.  This was the first time I had been presented with roasted seaweed/nori at the table, which I enjoy. Ordering the Kalbi, I didn't stray far from what I love.  But I did try some of Lindsey's Bulgogi.  Quite tasty as well.  
The prices were comprable to Hoodori and I would have to say the atmosphere is about the same. Clean and simple cafe style.  

If your are looking for quality Korean fare...this is a worthy stop!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place.. decided to come here a couple months ago after reading reviews from yelp for a long time now..  tofu soups are yummy.. galbi ribs were also pretty good.. kimchee was average.. jap chae was very well portioned.. overall a great experience..  a little pricey for lunch.. but I think al korean restaurants are overpriced.. guess that's my chinese side.. lol, will def be back?? Love the music!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Chodang so we made the trip out to Chandler and celebrated my father's 70th birthday there.

We feasted for my pop's birthday.  For (4) people we ordered (2) servings of Kalbi, (1) Bulgogi, (1) Jap-Chae, (1) order of fried mandoo, and (1) kimchi Tofu soup.  

Of course it was too much food, but we really enjoyed all the flavors.  The banchan was great, and they replenished the side dishes as we ate them up.  

There is no cooking at the table here, but don't let that hold you back, they cook it perfectly in the kitchen :-)

The waitstaff was extremely friendly.  Never had to ask for a drink refill or any of the banchan to be replenished. 

We will definitely come back when in the area!

PS. No birthday treats/goodies we could purchase for my pops but that was no biggie."}
{"text":"I've tried a few Korean restaurants in Phoenix to answer that bulgogi crave. It's hard to find a match to what I've used to eat when I lived in Songtan, S. Korea, but this place comes close. I mean to try other dishes but can't steer away from their beef bulgogi with sam (lettuce for wrap). This one isn't the type that grill in front of you, but the taste and friendly service make up for it. I highly suggest for others to try. Well worth your money."}
{"text":"I am Korean and this place has authentic Korean dishes.  Not quite as good as food my mother used to make.   Since we moved here from Southern California I have been looking for good Korean restaurant. Only reason I gave 4 stars is the prices.  I think they are little high."}
{"text":"If you are a asian, you must try this restaurant. The tofu soup with seafood is so good! And there will be a long line if you get there too late"}
{"text":"My wife and I finally had lunch at Chodang after having it on our list for quite sometime.  We ordered the Spicy BBQ Chicken and Seafood Tofu Soup.  Since we're new to Korean food, we didn't really know what to expect.  We enjoyed the side dishes that were served with our meal.  The Kim chi with the seaweed wrap was our favorite, but we enjoyed all of them.  In terms of our main course, the BBQ chicken was good, but the tofu soup was a little bland for me even after ordering it spicy.  Since this was my first time trying Korean food, I'm not sure if the tofu soup is supposed to be this way or not.  Nevertheless, the high quality of the food was apparent in all dishes, and we did enjoy our lunch.  

Service was very friendly and attentive.  They were eager to answer questions, provide drink refills, and check in on us at appropriate intervals.  They even offered refills on the side dishes.  Good overall experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean restaurants in the valley. I love the tofu soup  with Korean bbq lunch combos!! So good. I miss all the amazing spicy tofu and BBQ places in La and this restaurant comes very close. They have other really amazing dishes. The vegetable mixed noodle dish   is very good with large amounts of veggies mixed perfectly with the red bean paste and a little dash of sesame oil. Another favorite if I'm not eating the spicy tofu soup is the bulgogi jun gol ( ) which is bulgogi in a large pot with vegetables and noodles. So good especially on a cold day. Their food is my comfort food!!! My Korean food away from home. Also my favorite is the seafood pancake () as an appetizer. And lastly, my favorite if I'm craving rice is the dol dot bibimbap which is the stone pot mixed rice dish. Yum!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The service was really speedy, and all of the food was really tasty. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, hidden spot along the main road there is parking along back of the front is full.  Greeted right away and sat immediately which was perfect.   First time here so our waiter went over everything and what his favorites were.  Also explained the Korean vodka on how people drink it and like it.  

The food came out fast and from first bite we were in love.  I ordered the Korean bbq rib plate and my fiancé got the spicy chicken. Both full of flavor in every bite meat and chicken cooked perfectly.  Plus it comes with 6 different side dishes and rice.  It's a win win all around at this place.  

Can't wait to come back for more"}
{"text":"They make the best tofu soup in the valley!!!

Kalbi was really tasty as well. 

Service was always good."}
{"text":"I was complaining to a friend that since Takamatsu took a dump, I haven't been able to find another Korean BBQ and she told me about Chodang. I have been past this place a thousand times and never knew what it was.... I am so glad she recommended it because this place is awesome!!!! We tried it out today for lunch and it was perfect!!! Fast service, clean, friendly - just great!!! I had the Bulgogi lunch and my boss had the Bibimbap in the hot bowl and everything was delicious!!!
So happy to have found this place - We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Showed up here to eat with about 10 co-workers.  Initial service was prompt with our order taken in about 2 mintues.  Drinks arrived shortly after.  I ordered the spicy pork dish which is accompanied by a small bowl of rice and the requisite Korean side dishes.  The pork was tasty, and a bit spicy, but on the fatty side.  The sides were mostly un-remarkable.  All in all, it was fun to try something new, but there was nothing here that I experienced that would bring me back.

I did read the other reviews that talked about the soups, so I might have to give it another shot ... so many places to try, so little time/money."}
{"text":"Great experience for lunch hour today! Was not very busy when we got there about 12pm. Sat down as soon as we walked in. Two servers that were very friendly and attentive. Food came quick and was piping hot. Ordered the beef tofu soup and kalbi. Portions were big and prices were great. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food meets expectations but the portion is very French.  The banchans were very tasty and I loved the sweet apple with mayo.  I left hungry and refills of banchans were not offered.  I hoped they actually had combination meals but I had to order the soup separately which will set me back $25 for lunch which I am not exactly willing to do as many Korean restaurant in LA would be considered a norm.  That said, the presentations were excellent."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely one of my favorites in all of Phoenix! Been coming here for about 7 years and I've always had a wonderful experience each time. Very, very fast service (food usually comes out around 5 minutes after you order and its always hotter than you can eat right away,) friendly staff always trying to accommodate you, and just overall fantastic food. I can't say enough food things about this place. It's just so good. Stop reading and go right now."}
{"text":"My first yelp review should go to my all time favorite Korean restaurant in AZ. The food, service, and cleanliness at Chodang are amazing. Not only is the food delicious, authentic, & for a reasonable price (considering how much food you're getting), my favorite part is that they are not stingy with their side dishes. I'm sure I'm not the only one who is in love with side dishes, so when they offer more (once they see you've finished some), it makes the experience even better. 

I've been a regular there for about a year & have had the please of being served by different people; all of them were respectful & very attentive. 

Now for the food, my boyfriend & I enjoy the Tofu soups: favorites being mushroom, seafood & the bean paste soup (apparently it's an acquired taste).  I love love love the Nakji Dolsot Bibimbap (spicy octopus)- the octopus is always cooked well & it's spicy!"}
{"text":"If I lived in AZ I would be a repeat offender for sure!
Thanks to YELP :) I found this amazing gem!
Came here for dinner otw to the airport to fly back to Las Vegas.
I ordered to bulgogi and kalbi!
I'm in love! Delicious!!!!
Would love to come back and try their tofu soup.
If you're in AZ and looking for fantastic Korean food! Chodang is worth the visit!
Good quality food, about $20 a person.
I'm a fan!
-Miss Yelp 2012"}
{"text":"It's good, authentic Korean food. I had the BBQ pork.  Spicy, but in a good way. The place looks kinda sketchy from the outside.  Inside it's simple, but what matters is the food, and it delivers.  Will go back again."}
{"text":"Chodang serves the kind of food that you can only find in Los Angeles.  Not only is their food delicious, they're open 24/7!    The decor of the place is really nice and it's a nice clean place.  I recommend the tofu soup here but I would pass on the bibim bap. Despite being served in a hot stone bowl, the rice is pretty soggy and never crisps up. 

Definitely give this place a try if your on this side of town. 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great place! 

I've never really been a fan of trying new things. If I find something I like, I get it over and over and over. 

The girlfriends birthday came around and she told me that all she wanted was to try something different...so we went to Chodang. 

Different is definitely the word I would use, but in a good way. They start the meal by bringing out 6 small appetizers (we weren't sure what to do with them the first time we went there. do we put mix it with the food, do we eat it separately?) The entrees arrived promptly and were delicious. Service was excellent. We took my parents there a second time as well and they seemed to enjoy it as well. 

Anytime you're in the mood to try something a little different and alot tasty I would recommend Chodang."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Randomly found it while driving through Mesa and it's best authentic food I've found!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the waiters are kind and caring. Coming from a traditional Korean family, I can say that their food is authentic. I think what matters most is the food such as the famous kimchi soon tofu, seafood, and traditional bulgogi and galbi. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The bulgogi was really disappointing... not worth another visit back, especially given that Chandler has many Korean BBQ options."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean food in Phoenix, hands down.  I am a fan.  The Soondooboo is great, and the side dishes are wonderful.  This place gets busy so sometimes you have to be patient."}
{"text":"Wednesday lunch.Nice clean cafe.
Ordered a traditional Korean dish, bi bim bap.
Hot stone bowl with rice, and a variety of veggies and beef. Came with a bowl of beef broth. 6 sides on the table including Kim Chee and a pretty tasty sliced apple , to add to the bowl.
It was good, I enjoyed it, but I can't say I loved it. Nothing at all wrong with the food or service, just not my favorite. Strong dose of garlic, overpowering other flavors.
I've discovered I prefer other Asian styles and spices. 
Food must be pretty authentic, mostly Korean folks eating there."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat here in Chandler.  Delicious, well-presented foods, great variety, awesome side dishes, and a quiet, well-lit dining room.  The portions are enormous, so plan to bring some home, or share a meal with someone.  My only complaint would be about the background music (Kenny G? Really?)."}
{"text":"Awesomeness and delicious! Food is on authentic Korean and on point. Feels like a taste of home."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was pretty quick.  Place was busy when I got there around 1800 and got busier.  Not a lot of Korean restaurants around so if you looking for Korean food this would be a good choice."}
{"text":"My first visit to Chodang was just okay.

The waiter was eating his lunch in the dining room when we arrived.  He promptly got up and sat us.  To be fair, when we arrived it was at about 3:15 in the afternoon.  The dining room was completely empty except for us.  Our table had a couple crumbs on it, but looked like it had been recently wiped down.  The waiter placed paper placemats atop the table after seating us.  

Both my dining companion and I ordered the bibimbap.  When it was served, we were surprised that each of us only had approximately 1 tablespoon full of meat, perhaps less than one ounce in the entire dish.  The meat was also chilled, which was unexpected.

I've had bibimbap a handful of times and have loved it every time, except this one.  It was just okay for me.  When I added the hot sauce, it made it better tasting, albeit a little too hot since I squirted out a little too much.

I loved all the side dishes, though I did not try the dried seaweed.  

The bathroom did not have paper towels stocked, though there was a place for them.  There was only a hand dryer.  The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling.  I think this bathroom needed some attention.

All in all, I was a little disappointed in Chodang.  I am giving it three stars only because the waiter was attentive.  I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I'll go again. Go with someone else and share dishes. That way you can try  more! I have had the tofu soup, the tofu mushroom and no. 72 and they were all so good. The small dishes they serve before your meal are all so good. Can't wait to go back and try more new dishes!"}
{"text":"We come here often after having lived in Korea for over a year. 

I love the yu kei chong and the bulgogi. In wife gets dolsot and bipimbop. The Kimchi is excellent. They've got the Korean OB beer. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Their Tofu soup is to die for. It is delicious and prices are affordable. However, their Korean BBQ beef and rib vary. There are times they are absolutely delicious, but there are days it was overcooked and tasteless. It is hit or miss with these two dishes. Nevertheless, Tofu soup is still very consistent and I will definitely recommend it. 

As far as service goes, it is excellent when business is slow, but they are ALWAYS short staffs during the weekend and/or weeknight. It is extremely hard to get their attention or refill. Several times, they completely forgot about what I wanted (a glass of water, refill, or napkins) because there are only 2 waiters/waitresses during those hours."}
{"text":"good service, but food was just mediocre. tried the seafood tofu soup, the yook gae jjang, and the dol sot bi bim bap. all were decent, but just nothing extraordinary. the \"extra spicy\" tofu soup was not spicy enough and the bi bim bap lacked in some of the traditional ingredients. side dishes were good, but once at this place was enough for me."}
{"text":"So, I kinda feel bad that I didn't try any of the tofu soups here, since that is their specialty, but I was craving bibimbap so bad, so that's what I got. I was kind of bummed that it Just didn't hit the spot for me (Insert emoji crying face) It had too much rice, which did not get crispy on the bottom of the bowl (which is normally the best part!) and was missing that good savory/sweet Korean bbq flavor on the meat. One thing I was happy with was that it came with a raw egg. Normally the bowl is so hot it quickly cooks the egg as you mix it all together. Since the bowl wasn't hot enough to crisp the rice, it took a little bit longer than usual to cook up the egg. With all that said, it wasn't horrible or anything, it just was t the bibimbap I was looking for. 

I would love to go back though, and try the tofu soups, as I mentioned, that is more their specialty. The service was great, and it's very clean and cute inside. Prices were good too and they have a nice selection of Korean beers. Next time I'm in town, I may try it again if I happen to be in the area."}
