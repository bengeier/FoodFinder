{"text":"This place is my go to for Thai food in the area. Best pad Thai I've had anywhere near here. Phone orders are quick and they have always had my order correct when I pick it up."}
{"text":"We enjoy this restaurant and even order volcano wraps to go!  Consider this two 5 star ratings and one 2 star rating in one review.   The chicken in the pad thai tasted awful tonight.  Please review.  Service sometimes is slow also."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop shop.   Colorful hair and colorful food...top shelf!  Patio LED trees and bamboo fences give a \"Disney's Mulan meets Rave\" ambiance that perfectly complements the shrimp pad Thai.   Their food paints a masterpiece that can't be described through words. Flavors as magical as hearing a symphony in the dark.   If you don't get the half off appetizers when you buy a specialty drink, you are doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Pretty cheap, my peanut chicken rice bowl was pretty average and bland.  For the price, I'll probably come back to try the curry."}
{"text":"Nice little hidden gem! Was driving by looking for a nice place and found it for sure. Good food and cool decor, hope they can keep up with the volume as more people find this place. Pineapple shrimp was great!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Love the curry and tropical fried rice dishes. But the service is cringingly slow. I felt like I was the DMV. Tried calling multiple times to place a take-out order and no one answered. Decided to place it once I got there, and I watched the servers continue to hang up every call they received. Then waited for 45 minutes to get my food. It has potential but they need help."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I was on the verge of hangry so I was happy when the Fresh Rolls(best I've had) came quickly. We ordered the Green Curry and Ginger Fish, both amazing AND we ate way too much and still had food to take home. Can't wait to try the Phoenix location too!   This location is low on parking but, not a deal breaker and most of the time not a problem. Plus, if you do end up walking a little you'll have room for the chocolate cake ;)"}
{"text":"Came in a few Sundays ago and a second time two Fridays ago. Suh Noi is a perfect place to get an inexpensive, casual, DELICIOUS Thai meal. The employees are always extremely friendly and easygoing, and the atmosphere is very casual. I have had the yellow and red curries which were both delicious, but a bit too spicy for me. I'll try something else next time! This place is one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"The food was terrific and very reasonably priced. I got the peanut chicken and my sister got the candy chicken. We couldn't decide which we liked better because they were both so good! I'll be back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Omg. Still sitting at the pick up window 35 minutes later. They said it'd be 10-15 minute when we called in our order. Boo. I hope the food is good."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Love it so much. Spicy, delicious Asian-style food. They have a drive-thru, too! Lots of gluten-free options, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"They have drive thru and are fairly quick for cooking pad Thai! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"OMG!  We just found  our new Thai spot! Food was more than spectacular, the service amazing and right around the corner from our house. If you like to explore new places ,this should be on your to - do list."}
{"text":"This WAS our favorite Thai restaurant. Went there Tonite and had Pad Thai and Thai basil chicken. The food came out cold and when reheated, the chicken was tough in both dishes. We asked for medium spice and the dishes were very mild. We used to think that this was a 5 star place. Not anymore !!!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant to have thai food in az. Especially have to try the pork ribs and fried rice."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  I've been searching for my go-to Thai in the East valley, and I am happy to say the search is over. Same great menu as the central ave location, but more convenient for me as an east sider.  First went to this location last week, had the beef panang (hot)...perfect spice for my taste, and one of the best panangs anywhere, let alone Phoenix.  Quirky, mod decor at the Scottsdale location, but cool.  Get there!"}
{"text":"What an adorable place! And after the place has been void of a business for sometime, it's about time.  THE PLACE: Adorable decor. Quite appropriate for a little Asian diner with a  modern feel to it. Some one really loves Anime, as you will see murals and Anime posters and photos of cosplayers.  Parking, not an issue, there's plenty of parking. Can't dine in? Order your food to go through the pick-up window. You can even call ahead and just pick up your food at the drive through. You can see the ladies working the kitchen, and I observe the place to be quite clean. Not sure about the restroom though, as I was only there to pick-up our take-away food.  THE SERVICE: We phoned in our order. We were told our order would be ready for pick-up in 15 minutes, and that we can pick it up at the drive thru window. I thought that was really neat.  As we have never been here before, we decided to come down and pick-up the food. The young lady who took my  order via phone rang us up, and I added a Thai Tea to go. As she was the only one manning the front of the store, we waited a few minutes before we could get the Thai Tea as she had to assist other customers. Overall, it was alright with us, but I caution that she may need additional help, during busy times.  THE FOOD: We ordered for 2 Candy Chicken Combos with Tom Ka Gai, 2 Yellow Curry Combos with Tom Ka Gai and 1 Pad Thai. Truthfully, it was just okay. The Candy Chicken which was given much praise by other reviewers due to the plum sauce, was not what I expected. The plum sauce was more like an overly sweet chili sauce. The curry, was a bit watered down from what we were accustomed to. The Pad Thai was alright. It tasted quite fine, but I do have to say, I've had better at other establishments with a comparable price range.  Will I come back? Sure! I would like to try other items at the place. Hey, I'm hopeful I would be better impressed at the next visit and would have to update this review. Go small businesses!"}
{"text":"Lovely - everyone in our party of 6 was impressed. Our food was tasty, attractively presented, hot, and of good quantity.  Small and informal but very nicely decorated in a modern, classy way. I hesitated to write a review because I'm afraid business will get so good that we won't be able to drop in!"}
{"text":"Love their food!! But on a Friday night, to sit at the pickup window for a full 20 minutes being ignored because only one server is working (she was clearly stressed) and then find out they didn't even make the food at all is annoying. I saw three patio tables get up and leave. They need to staff better. But the food is very tasty and I'll keep coming back - just at non-peak dinner hours!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today and was, once again, amazed at the flavor and presentation of my meal. The salmon salad was perfect and the crab appetizer was delicious. I've been coming here for a couple of years and it looks like the the secret has spread; the Little Thaiger is a treasure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner a couple of days ago.   He had the vegetarian fried rice and I had the Tom Ki Gai soup.   Both were pretty good, but don't expect anything extra.   My husband wanted an extra fried egg and was told they couldn't to that.   He asked if they had eggs,  and was told yes but they couldn't fry one up for him even if he paid extra.   So it was they wouldn't, not that they couldn't.   He then asked if he could get a small side of the yellow curry sauce and again he was told that they couldn't do that either.   If he wanted the yellow curry sauce, he had to order the complete dish.  So while the food was fine,  the service was not.   It is another case where service lags and where the restaurant only gives what they want and is not interested in serving their customers in excellence."}
{"text":"Lovely place. We had a wonderful lunch. We tried wild tiger a few days ago and liked enough to try the other location a few days later. Dragon eggs are the best!"}
{"text":"This is the best Kept secret for Thai cusine in the valley. Best fresh spring rolls,Pad Thai, and desserts!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Tom Ka Gai soup and Spicy Chicken Basil dish for takeout. The soup was excellent and had lots of veggies in it. The chicken dish was ok, but a little over cooked. The portion of the chicken dish was pretty small. The staff there when I went to pick up was very friendly and inviting, but my expected 15 minute wait turned into over 30 minutes. I'll go back and try some more things for sure as it's close, but they haven't become my new go to Thai place."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding.   Reasonably priced and good portions.  The only thing that gave it less than 5 stars was staffing. Our server was great, but was all alone in a busy restaurant struggling to keep up. Hoping for her sake it was a \"someone called on sick\" - but it would be great to get some help."}
{"text":"So so so good! My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch on a Monday afternoon. Fantastic service by Gabby who was so lovely and so sweet. The chef even made an appearance at the table to say hello-then proceeded to say hello to the other guest in the restaurant. Didn't seem too busy however, which is unfortunate since everything was excellent. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. Waited so long for everything -- while the restaurant was nearly empty. The food was okay, not terrific. Go to the other location. I've heard better things from that one."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We walked in and sat there for 10 minutes. Nobody came to say one word to us."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place with great prices! Everything is very clean and well decorated, and the employees are always extremely gracious. Their Thai burger is a must try-- be warned though, the hot sauce on it IS spicy, so maybe get it on the side your first time!"}
{"text":"I usually get the chicken pad Thai. I am a big fan! However the quality can fluctuate. I've had it a few times and it's been awesome and other times it's been not so great. I keep coming back so that says something! When it's good , it's SO good."}
{"text":"Peanut Chicken was delicious! My wife's Yellow Curry Beef was too hot but it was tasty....next time we'll know to request mild."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that tonight was my 3rd time here in the last 2 weeks. I have tried several different items and so far they have all been great! My first visit I wasn't really in the mood for curry, so I went with the Candied chicken which is lightly coated in a plum sauce that is really good. On my next visit I had the yellow curry with chicken which spicy, but not too spicy, and a creamy coconut sauce which is really tasty. However my favorite part of the curry dish was the potatoes! I also ordered the Thaiferno burger as I was curious what it was like. The burger was very juicy and had some sort of herbs and seasoning cooked into it which made it very flavorful. It was too with cheese, veggies and some sort of spicy sauce that was a little different for a burger, but still good. Tonight, on my 3rd visit, I went for the Peanut Chicken combo with vegetables and the tropical chicken fried rice. The peanut chicken was awesome and is so far my favorite dish I've tried here. The peanut sauce is really tasty with the jasmine rice and it also came with a mix of cauliflower, broccoli, potatoes carrots and more. Definitely my favorite. I had originally ordered the tropical fried rice with beef, but when I got home I noticed they made it with chicken. I wasn't upset about this as the chicken was really good and now I just have another reason to go back for the beef! I also ordered a slice of mango cheesecake that i have yet to try, but it looks amazing! The green tea is great too as it has a plum taste, I think it might be Arizona brand? Oh and if you plan to order anything more than a rice bowl or curry, call your order in if you want to use the drive through as it can get busy here!"}
{"text":"Checked out all these web sites and decided to try the LIttle Thaiger and oh my God were we surprised and thrilled.  This place is a jewel of a find for Foodies searching out new and exciting venues.  Everything in this place is new and different.  The artwork on the wall is not the same old touristy Thai artifacts but hand painted animes and paintings.  The furniture is white modern with white couches surrounding a smallish TV.  The waitress was a walking anime, half Thai (perfect English) and family.      Wine selection is small but nice, like the restaurant itself.  It is a small place as the name implies, catering to local takeout but with a nice, local crowd.  The food is the best Thai I have ever eaten.  The fresh spring rolls were a meal unto themselves and the Pad Thai has been voted Best in The Valley. Pad Thai was about the only traditional thing on the menu, everything else is new and exciting or twists on the old favorites.  Cannot say enough good things about this place   https://www.littlethaiger.com"}
{"text":"I arrived at 1:00 in the afternoon for lunch. 1st thing I notice is their neon \"Open\" sign was not on, I almost didn't stop in.  I informed the server (Tiger tattoo on arm) of such and she giggled and said \"oh I forgot the do that\" but still didn't go turn the sign on.  I Was the only person in the place and ordered the Curry Chicken and requested hot chili sauce on the side. I  Arrived home to find, of course that she had forgotten the hot chili sauce. When I called to complain the server advised I could come back and get it but I hadn't been charged for it so...  Well that wasn't the point, the fact that you can't remember to turn on your own open for business sign or a simple request of chili sauce on the side, speaks volumes of the incompetence of this server.  The food was mediocre at best and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great local Asian food in old town that doesn't cost a ton and has great portions for price!   Staff was very friendly and accommodating! Try the candy chicken bowl w jasmine rice! It has a lot of chicken and just the right amount of sauce!   I will definitely be returning and trying the coconut water...in a coconut!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I ate here and I must say it was a great first impression. There are not many Thai places like this. We had the Temple of Fire, which is fried rice. I would recommend trying it with brown rice as a substitute. Never tried brown fried rice like this before, but it was shockingly good. They call it Temple of Fire because its spicy fried rice. I also ordered the Dragon Eggs, crispy. This puts a spin on the normal crab/fish cakes most Thai restaurants offer. Just read the ingredients and you can get a pretty good idea.  We also ordered Beef Prig King. My wife is half Thai and stated that this dish was very authentic tasting and reminded her of her mother's cooking. Great compliment for sure."}
{"text":"By far, the best Thai around the Scottsdale area; a somewhat hidden gem. We just moved to Boston and we've been trying to find something that compares!"}
{"text":"After seeing several good reviews on this establishment we decided to try The Little Thaiger. The parking lot was extremely small, and it was difficult to determine whether we could park along the sides of the business that have red painted curbs indicative of a fire lane. The inside of the facility was nice. The waitstaff was very attentive to us, and provided good service.  We had Dragon Eggz for an appetizer, and they were OK at best. I had two of these dumplings. One was good, but the other was terrible because of several crunchy pieces in there (gristle, shells, or something else?).   The papaya salad was also ordered for the table. The response on this item was that it was lacking flavor. I did not have any of this item.  For the entrees our table ordered fresh rolls, 24k, and the tropical fried rice. The fresh rolls were bland, with dry chicken and shrimp in there. I received no feedback regarding the 24k. I had the tropical fried rice, which was bland. I expected more flavor from this dish, but there was not much pineapple in the dish. I paired the rice dish with pork, which was extremely dry. I found the dish to be rather forgettable, and could only eat half of it.  One very odd item of note at this establishment was what was playing on the televisions. On the TV above the bar the movie Finding Dory was playing. On another wall was a series of videos from YouTube that were supposed to, I guess, highlight videos from Thailand. If you are familiar with YouTube you know that once a video ends a suggested video starts playing afterwards based on the previous video. When we where there the videos that were playing were showing \"working girls\" (prostitutes) on the bangkok 112 channel. For about 30 minutes straight there were these videos playing before it stopped playing. I would suggest that this establishment be more vigilant in what is playing on these monitors.  I do not recommend this restaurant, and I will not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome ginger chicken made with fresh ingredients. Friend had chicken pad thai and said it was really good. Will definitely be back with work crew!"}
{"text":"YUM!! This place is very close to my house, which could be good or bad. We came in during an early afternoon and were the only ones there. The place is nice and clean, decorated sparsely but, it looks nice.  We ordered the corn fritters for an app and they did not disappoint. I am actually thinking about going back just for those as I type this. I had the Pad Thai, it was made with the perfect amount of heat I requested. I can't recall what my friend had, but he loved it. I woul recommend this place to anyone, its nice to have some Thai food in this area. There aren't many options here in South Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had the chicken pad thai and I enjoyed it - on the menu it said it was \"spicy\" and it wasn't spicy to me.. ( it's like taco bells \"fire\" sauce but it's not hot at all ) The service was okay - It's located right by a smoke stop in a small building.. It can easily be missed. I would come back and try something different since they have many other options but it's not on top of my list when I am wanting spicy."}
{"text":"The tom Ka was AMAzing.  Get the forbidden fried rice. Thai martini.  I'm really happy about how wonderful it is in person. First time to dine in and wayyyy better than take out. Yea. Great solo experience."}
{"text":"I love me some Thai food! They take traditional Thai and add their own special touch to it. The portion sizes are good, and they offer a wide variety of entrees and apps. The dragon balls are amaze balls! So tasty. The sweet coconut rice that comes with some of their entrees is ridiculously tasty. Never had a bad experience. They're not my most favorite Thai place, but they are up there!"}
{"text":"I called to place an order for pickup. The lady on the phone was very nice and told me it would be 20 minutes. When I got the food I was curious because it smelled very different from any other Thai food I've ever gotten. But both the Pad Se Ew and pad Thai (Medium spice) were amazing! I would definitely order again :)"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Really like the soups and the innovative pad thai using papaya instead of noodles.  Dragon eggs appetizer is also awesome.  Nice portions.  Cute décor.  Very nice staff, but the service is quite slow, and unapologetic about it.  It can take 30-45  minutes for the order to arrive, and no one checks in with you or talks to you during the wait.  You just wait.  Perhaps we can order in advance and eat-in instead of taking out because it is quite a pleasant place to sit."}
{"text":"I saw the original The Wild Thaiger on Diners Drive Ins and Dive......the little Thaiger was closer to our house so we gave it a try.  OMG the food is amazing!!!!!!  We split Dragon Eggz, Chicken Pad Thai and egg rolls.  This location is small and sooooo cute.  Service was excellent.  In reading the other reviews about slow services yes I could see it getting a little slow to get your food, but keep in mind they make everything to order.  Nothing was sitting around getting cold and old like a lot of restaurants.  My husband even commented this will be his new place to take customers for lunch.  We went for lunch and were very tempted to go back for dinner.  There is also a drive in window that you can call ahead and pick your food up.  Wish I could give more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, it isn't unbelievable, but it's above decent. The real problem is the shitty service. The waitresses are just rude, I wish they would be somewhat friendly. If it were just food it would get 3/12 or 4 stars, but I went lower because of the service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  Try the Chicken Pad See Ew.  Everyone is very friendly and they have a great bar."}
{"text":"As always this place is amazing! Fresh food and great prices. Just tryed the Crab wontons for the first time tonight and they are the best I have ever had. You cant go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Great Thai spot in old town! Highly recommend the Panang and the Tom Ka Gai. The owner is super sweet too...she came out of the kitchen to introduce herself to me and family. The location is easy to miss so business seems to be a little slow there. I highly encourage you to check it out. It would be a shame to see this little gem go away!"}
{"text":"I saw their Phoenix location in the episode of diner, drive ins and dives so I wanted to check them out! There were probably only about maybe 6 parking spots and I was lucky enough to find an empty one, not sure if they had other spots available.   When we came in, there were 2 servers and no one said anything for a couple minutes so we decided to just grab a seat. It took them a while to come up to us too and mind you there were only 4 other customers in the restaurant.   We ordered the Tom ka gai, Mu Yang and pad Thai. Wow...  their tom ka gai, (coconut soup) was so good! I always order that in Thai restaurants and theirs is definitely one of the best I've had. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The flavors are one point. You need it order it no matter what! The pad Thai was good too. Guy Fieri tried the Mu yang (pork skewers) so of course we had to try it! It came with 3 skewers -- They were good, but honestly I've had better bbq pork before.   I would give 4.5 stars for their food, the flavor was amazing! I felt like I had a home cooked meal! But the service really turned me off. She barely refilled my water, barely checked on us. I felt like I waited around for my food to come, and I can see it in the kitchen, waiting for her to serve it to us. Definitely won't be coming back to dine in, but will just order take out for next time."}
{"text":"The customer service was good. They sat us quickly during lunch hours and brought out our drinks pretty quickly. As for the food, it did take a while for it to come out even though we were the second group to arrive. The wait was well worth it because it was very flavorful but, the noodles were a little under cooked"}
{"text":"I really like the food and decor here.  I thought the anime theme was pretty neat too, but they're trying to move away from it-- which I guess I can understand.  It seemed to irk pretentious half wits like Ken G below.  Ease up and enjoy the food next time, Kenny.  I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"My Thai wife and I just finished dinner and am writing to say this place is a gem.  My wife started with the Papaya Salad and I had Larb Gai, which is surprisingly not on the menu but pretty much a Thai staple.  It was great they made this dish for me with no problem.  We each added sticky rice.  Both dishes were excellent.  For our main course my wife ordered Holy Chicken Basil but substituted pork and I had the Peanut Chicken.  We each added brown rice.  Again, neither dish disappointed.  I think we over-ordered because the potions were significant, thus we had take-home.  No complaints there.  We only drank water so the total meal was $44.00, which for as much food as we ordered was an exceptional value.  As noted by other reviewers the restaurant is immaculate.  The two young ladies named Gabby and Esperanza were constantly cleaning when not taking care of their food serving responsibilities.  I mean they really cleaned.  Not the cursory swipe of a nasty wet rag over a portion of a table.  I wish all restaurants were half this clean!  The cooks (Pa and Mawn) are the sweetest ladies and not surprisingly took time to talk to my wife and I to make sure we were pleased with our meal.  If you have a desire for Thai food and are in the Scottsdale area I strongly urge you give this place a try as you will not be disappointed.  It is after all aroi mak mak.  As a side note to another reviewer (Bryan K., Alexandria, VA), I realize we all have a right to our opinions (there's an old saying about such) but this struck me as write-anything-that's-on-your-mind(!) lacking much thought.  I can't image what would have given you the impression it was a sushi establishment.  Were you thrown by the name \"Suh Noi\" and didn't finish reading after the \"su\"?  Here's a clue.  If you ever walk into a sushi restaurant and there is no sushi bar, well, it's not a sushi restaurant.  \"Big tasting.\"  \"We got steamed.\"  Who writes like that?  We're all dumber for having had to endure your review.  Be more responsible and literate when writing your reviews."}
{"text":"Suh Noi (Wild Thaiger's sister restaurant) is a cute, modern and casual spot to get Thai food. My husband and I ordered the Mee Krob, Fresh Spring Rolls and Beef Panang. The Mee Krob was good at first, but it was also very sweet and made for a wearing dish. I could only eat a small amount as the sugar was a little overwhelming for me, I wouldn't order this again. The fresh rolls were indeed fresh as well as delicious and healthy. I've had these at Wild Thaiger and they tasted the same, just as good as I remember. The panang was a bit spicy and very authentic. You could taste every flavor and could tell they didn't skimp with the proper ingredients as a lot of other Thai places do. Service was great too, our server really knew the menu and was great at explaining the dishes to everyone. I will definitely return to try more of the menu, but it will be really hard to stray from that panang."}
{"text":"Whoa the food is Really Good. When you have good food nothing else matters. this will be my new Sunday night ritual. it used to be another thai place in old town that started with an M. presentation is very nice too."}
{"text":"My first time ordering Thai take out and I was very impressed! The inside is super cute and the staff was friendly. We were quoted 25 minutes for our food to be ready. Parking spots are in the rear. When I went in to pay, their iPad started doing an update and they couldn't process the transaction. It took the girls several minutes trying to figure it out before I just decided to give them my cash and not get any change in return. They need a second computer!  Aside from that slight inconvenience, the food was phenomenal! I had the curry and the flavor was outstanding. And all at a reasonably price tag."}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant was a bit tricky as I almost went past it. I thought the interior decor was quite interesting and was not expecting Anime posters here. As for the Thai food it was decent and the service is fairly casual and easy going.  I asked the person at the front for recommendations and decided to try the Yellow Curry rice bowl. The food was about what I expected and although I knew that it was going to be mild spicy it was actually more spicy than expected. The mild spicy seemed more like a borderline medium, which is probably what I preferred anyway.  I also noticed that this restaurant features a drive thru, something that most Thai restaurants do not offer. Based on this I would most likely come back here to try some of their other dishes especially as the Basil Chicken looks pretty good."}
{"text":"Decided to step out of comfort zone today and try something new on menu today. I have been here once before and got a seafood dish but the lunch menu has large selection of popular dishes. I picked  Yellow Curry Chicken with Thai tea. The lunch specials come your choice of soup or crispy spring roll. I chose the spring roll along with my chicken curry. Can I say love at first bite! Disclaimer I have never had curry and I am in love with complex depth of flavor. The dish has nice portion of chicken in rich yellow curry sauce w/ veggies along with jasmine rice. I could not stop eating and finished the entire dish. I am very pleased with my selection and will come back to check out more dishes on this menu."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, but we've been here almost two hours and I'm still waiting on my entree. They close in 30 minutes... Hope I have time to eat it before they close and kick me out. DDD... They're right... Food is great! If you're a dine-in as opposed to take-out, don't plan on a time effective meal. Everyone got their food before me. Mine showed up after everyone else finished. Now I'm awkwardly waiting for my food to cool down while everyone stairs at me with begging eyes to eat faster so we can go home to bed. So awkward. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Over-priced and no flavor. This is the 4th time we have tried this restaurant and, again, disappointed. We won't be back. We ordered pad Thai spicy 3-it arrived-no heat, no flavor. The Tom Ga Gai (coconut soup) same thing, ordered spicy 3--no heat, no flavor...other than salt. The chicken in both dishes was totally over cooked and pure rubber. This is NOT Thai food, but a very mild, McDonald's version of expensive \"trendy\" food. The service can be rude and arrogant or dismissive. They definitely don't like to hear that the food isn't spaced as ordered...the server placed a spice rack at our table with no comment. Don't go."}
{"text":"It is a little strange feeling given the obvious past history of this place as a fast food restaurant however they've done a nice job of making it as intimate as possible given the layout. They darkened up the room with window covers and set tables with tea lights. If they got rid of the TV on the wall and somehow closed off the bar and open kitchen a bit more it would be even more intimate. The drink cooler to the left of the bar brings down the casualness to an incongruous level with the dining room.  We tried the Mu Yuang and the De-Cha Boar and both were delicious although wildly different.  The wild boar was a little chewy and reminded us of a slow stewed very intensely flavored dish with lots of chilis, Asian string beans, onions and sweet peppers. It had a very strong garlic and chili flavor that complemented the boar.  The grilled pork skewers (three) served with the sticky rice and papaya salad was the better of the two dishes. The pork was very tender with strong grill flavor and a delicious green chili spicy dipping sauce that was also slightly sweet and we actually we poured it onto the wild boar dish and it lightened it up quite a bit.  We didn't try to dumplings or noodle dishes but will in the future.   The service was a little scattered from our vantage point at the bar and we probably would not have noticed if we had sat at a table. They do a strong carryout business."}
{"text":"A nice little place with some different options. I just finished this delicious food! It was my first time eating Thai food and I was not disappointed. I got the Fat One and even though I'm sitting here with my mouth on fire from the spice, it was sooooo good! I'm thinking of shrimp next time, this time I got plain. I'm smiling from ear to ear and I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is very conveniently located at Scottsdale and Thomas.  Unfortunately, it'll only have to do in a pinch, I'm not a huge fan of the pad thai and pad see-ew there.  It's not spicy at all and just doesn't taste right.  There are a lot of vegetables in both dishes which I appreciate.  They should definitely vent the boxes, when you get things to go the noodles are one big stuck together wad and the cilantro is all wilted."}
{"text":"This place has a cute atmosphere, especially if you love anime and Thai food! The portions they give are a lot! Food-wise everything was delicious! Hand down the best Thai food in the Scottsdale area. I got the pad sie-ew and thaiger ribs. So delicious!! If you're from out of town and are looking for a bite for the night, I suggest heading here!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday near closing in desperate need of drunk food. This place is near my apt and I am stoked to have it. We got chicken satay and fried rice along with the spring rolls. It was good, quick, reasonably priced and they were really nice about how late it was. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our hotel clerk said his girlfriend likes this place, and Yelp looked good, so we gave it a try.  OMG. SO. GOOD.  We noticed Guy Fieri has been here for DDnD.  Some of the items on the menu are marked to let you know what he tried.  We got some of those, plus some others. I would call this \"modern-traditional Thai.\"  I would also call it fantastic."}
{"text":"Sweet people but not the Thai experience I was hoping for...   the lunch specials were not exactly all that \"special\".  The Thom Kha soup was barely spicy enough though it was creamy and I liked the vegetables in it but the soup I am accustomed to usually allows the mushrooms to absorb the flavors, and that was not apparent with my order.  The noodles in the accompanying meal were OK but again not spicy enough despite requesting so, the chicken was tough and tasteless.  The meal looked appetizing enough but was a sad disappointment when it came to taste.   Not likely to return"}
{"text":"The food here leaves a lot to be desired and it looks like a day care center inside with a buncha Pokémon stuff inside on the walls etc. this is obviously the kiddos place, they can't be serious, maybe the owners wanted to keep their kids out of the downtown location so they got this one and let the kids run it, that's my guess. If the food was good I'd totally let that slide but this place is the opposite of a winner"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on yelp I was really excited to try this place out. I have to say it was a let down. They use extra spice to make up for what they lack in flavor. The only reason I may go back is because it's the only decent Thai game in town."}
{"text":"This is a great little place with good food, many vegetarian options and attentive staff."}
{"text":"The food was amazingly tasty - maybe some of the best Thai food I've had.  The service was great too.  Why three stars and not five?  The portion sizes are ridiculously small.  Really, so small that I kept looking in the bag to see where the rest of it was.  The entree prices are typical to slightly-high for similar quality Thai food ($12.90 with tax for my order).  I always split an entree of Thai food with my daughter, and we are good to go.  I have done this at over 5 different Thai restaurants in the valley, and portion sizes are never an issue.  I am not talking about a total of five meals; I'm talking about dozens of visits to each of our top 5 favorite Thai restaurants.  It felt light when I picked up the to-go bag, but when I saw the portion size when I got home, it became evident why it seemed as if the bag was filled with lightly packed feathers.  I didn't even try to share this; I gave the whole meal to my daughter, and I made a deli sandwich with some turkey from my last trip to Costco.  I did taste it though, and man it was good.  My daughter loved it too.  If I win the lottery and prices and value don't much matter anymore, I'll be back.  Until that day, I'll stick with my regular Thai food favorites where I don't have to break the bank to get a meal."}
{"text":"Very good chicken curry lunch special. Just spicy enough, not overpowering. Himself had the beef and broccoli, which he said was very good. Ordered the dragon eggs since that was what guy fieri had on ddd, and that was just okay. Cute and clean place, food worthy of second visit."}
{"text":"This is my first time checking into this place. It literally is a hole in the wall type restaurant but very, very nicely appointed inside. It doesn't feel greasy or dirty and the interior is clean. The food item menu appears to be standard Thai fare. I went with the chicken curry which appears to be a staple that very few restaurants can mix up. This was extremely delicious with a nice blend of  heat and sweet, the proportions were excellent. This is a great place for lunch and dinner. I'm looking for to exploring this menu further. And I will recommend highly to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Nice little Thai place in South Scottsdale. Food was excellent, we ordered our food pretty quickly, but it took a little longer than expected for the food to come out even though we were the only table there.  I ordered a tall glass of their Thai Iced Tea. It was good just as expected. For the meal I ordered Mu Yang, which comes with 3 pork skewers , sticky rice and  a nice helping of papaya salad to help balance out the richness of the meal. The dish was great. A perfect combination of sweet, sour and savory all in one dish. The sticky rice was like a dessert in itself."}
{"text":"We originally discovered Suh Noi through GrubHub, and were thrilled with the quality of their take-out food! It turned out to be right around the corner from us, so we decided (after ordering it a half a dozen times) to finally go in and check it out.  The building is small and has a drive through window, but don't let that fool you! The place is actually really nice!! They include nice glassware and place-settings on each of the tables, and in prettier weather, their trendy outdoor area looked like it would be a cozy, fun place to hang out.  As far as food goes, I have my favorites for sure. The Dragon Egg (steamed) appetizer is wonderful! If you're not much for spicy food, just take the jalapenos off and they're fine. I believe that there are six to an order, and my boyfriend and I usually polish them off together. (It's sort of like a delicious, moist meatball in a dumpling! So good!!!) My usual main-course is the Pad Thai, which I like to get extra spicy! The flavor is great, and I love that they serve it with some raw veggies that give it a great texture. My only complaint would be the size of the hunks of chicken. If they cut those down a bit, it would be easier to eat with chopsticks and you'd get some chicken in more of your bites. (Right quantity, wrong size.) That said, it's still great!!! My boyfriend usually goes for a chicken and veggies dish, and he's never had any complaints. Of course, the chicken egg rolls are awesome, and a favorite we often order too... As you can imagine, with all of this food, we almost always have a meal for the next day!!   Overall, we were really impressed by this unexpectedly trendy spot! If you're looking for something quick and delicious, check it out one evening. If you have a little more time, they offer some decent wines too."}
{"text":"This is such a great Thai place! I get Thai food once a week, and this is one of my favorites. I love this little place. It is affordable compared to other Thai restaurants in Scottsdale & they have lunch specials. You can order for pick up and go through  a drive through window which is great for a rushed lunch hour. I love the Yellow Curry with Tofu and Veggies. I am a vegetarian and finding well made tofu is hard and this place does it perfect! If you want something a little sweeter try the Coconut sticky rice with a meal- it is amazing. The staff is so kind and they really want to make sure you enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I love Suh Noi! The staff is always friendly and they have a unique offering for Thai fusion cuisine. They are quick to serve you and the ambience is great for a little fast-food joint. I love the decor!   This joint is a great little gem in South Scottsdale. If you like heat don't forget to ask for chef hot!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavor and freshness, beautiful presentation with perfectly crafted thai sauces. A definite must try! . ."}
{"text":"We ordered the spring rolls and a tofu curry dish. The rolls were good, but the peanut sauce was a runnier and tangier consistency than I'm used to and like. The curry was also more sour than expected. Service was spotty."}
{"text":"Very delicious Chicken rolls and Chicken pad Thai very nice place great food and service. It's a great place despite the fact that guy ferriiere likes it. The poster of that moron on the door is the only thing bad about this place."}
{"text":"I believe the correct name for this restaurant is Suh Noi - The Little Thaiger. This is a small super casual Thai restaurant with a drive-thur window. The menu is small compared to other Thai places but they also serve some unique foods too. You order at the register and seat yourself.   Based on what we had they are deserving of at least 4 stars as the food really was very good.  In both dishes we tried the meats were cooked nicely and the dishes actually had enough basil.   I had the Holy Basil Chicken. The chicken was tender and this dish had enough basil to make it taste good. This dish ran much hotter than I was expecting and I almost couldn't eat it. I ordered it very hot. About 1/2 of other Thai places don't make very hot that hot and I'm usually left wanting more heat but NOT THIS TIME. I'm not the biggest fan of jalapeños in Thai Food but it's such a big deal to find a place that uses Holy Basil I got it anyway.   My husband had a similar dish the Wild Boar Grapao. This dish is made more the way I like. The meat was hand chopped in a similar but slightly different sauce with Thai Basil and Thai Chili's. The very hot in this dish was mild compared to the Holy Basil Chicken but was spicy. For $1.50 extra you have the option to have your dish Thai Style with a fried egg.  Very good and above average for sure."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on Little Tiger, I thought I'd give this Thai Restaurant a shot. Although I was quite disappointed. I ordered the Pad See Ew with beef and it had zero flavor, the Thai Tea tasted nothing like Thai Tea & only had 4 boba balls in my drink."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Very good and very fast - and this area needed a good, fast place for lunch (they even have a drive thru). Panang curry was properly spicy.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem . The food is OUTSTANDING. My fav is the beef panag. And for a appetizer I love the dragon eggs .... delicious ! You can't beat there lunch specials"}
{"text":"Currently sitting here now. While the food has been delightful so far, the service has been severely lacking. We started our evening by walking in to the restaurant and up to the counter, where the server had her back to the door and us for several minutes. My friend and I stood there talking and while I hoped that the sound of our voices would cause her to turn around and notice us, it did not actually happen until she went to move away from the counter.   The entire ordering process was painful as she kept telling us that \"she'd be right back\". Despite only having one other table at the time, this girl seemed to have a great deal of trouble multitasking.  Considering how much I enjoyed the original location in Phoenix, I'm greatly disappointed with my experience tonight."}
{"text":"Yum! Our go to Thai restaurant - great portions and great prices. I love the beef panang and dragon eggs. Definitely come here for delicious authentic Thai!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place, love the atmosphere and artwork.  Food was excellent - fresh and healthy preparation.  Service was good and quick.  Parking is in the back.  They even have a drive thru!  Recommend the Pad Thai and the Fresh Rolls."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time as I was given gift certificates over Christmas. Had the  Tom Ka Gai, a chicken coconut soup, it was fantastic, the best I've had, probably tried it at over 50 places. Had the chicken pad Thai, was in the top few that I've had. The Catfish Prigking was ok, nothing special. My friend had the Seafood Panang and as a chef he thought it was excellent. The ambience is nice and relaxing, love the led flower  blossom trees. It's not to large inside, they have a patio as well. Staff was friendly and welcoming. This is now tied with SumoMaya as my two favorite restaurants in Arizona, if you have been to SumoMaya for me to compare this place you know you have to come try it now, you'll be happy you did!  *the next day* Just had the left over Catfish by it self and it was great! So Much better then it being OK like I thought it was yesterday. I think I first found it to be just OK yesterday is cause I was eating it at the same time as the epically fantastic dishes."}
{"text":"This little place is still our go to for Thai food. Not only is it close by or that it has pick up, but simply because it continues to be so delicious. One of my favorites is the pad see ew. Delicious flat noodles in broth with plenty of vegetables. Their pad Thai is the best I've had outside Thailand. But coming in a top 3 Thai dish is the catfish pradking. It looks unassuming at first with its fried catfish fillets and side of rice but once you pour that hot Thai curry sauce on, you will be hard pressed to find a tastier dish. All that for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"All the food was good and the service was good as well.  I would recommend the Dragon Eggs for an appetizer.  The Peanut Passion dish was just the right amount of food and was tasty."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time ordering from The Little Thaiger.  While I ordered through Grub Hub and found THAT service abysmal, when the food finally arrived one hour later than originally quoted time, it was hot, and fabulous.  The Tom Ka Gai soup was one of the best I've had (perfectly seasoned) and the Pad Thai was equally fantastic- great spice, heat, and no skimping on the cilantro.  I will certainly either dine in or take out again, however I will pass on the Grub Hub service.  This may now have replaced my go-to Thai restaurant Thai Lahna.  We'll have to see..."}
{"text":"Really flavorful and eye-opening Thai food."}
{"text":"Amazing coconut rice!! An amazing light desert I almost eat everyday now!! Addicted! It's like $2. Also their spring rolls are incredible!!! A hidden gem in Scottsdale. Don't miss out. Fun atmosphere as well!!! There hours are not right tho! They are open till 10pm on Friday and Saturday!"}
{"text":"Great food but extremely bad customer service that just ruined the whole dining experience. And the place wasn't even packed! The five of us sat on the patio and had to go inside several times to remind the waiters to clean our table, then to have them take our drink orders, then to order food, then, an hour later, to see if they forgot about orders ... It took close to an hour and a half for our food to arrive during which time we saw multiple customers pick up their to-go orders. There were two servers there, and the male server was nice but the waitress was very rude and had attitude. When we asked her to wipe our table, she replied that it would be difficult because they are very busy (only 3 or 4 tables were occupied at that time). And as I mentioned in the beginning, the food, when it finally arrived, was delicious. However, it was Not worth while waiting for it for nearly two hours. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The prices are right for the food they serve. I love the decor. And their drink menu is good. Lives up to be a good little Asian diner, overall. It's new business so hopefully they improve.  I would get everything besides the ramen. Doesn't really taste like ramen because the noodles aren't ramen noodles and the soup is just full of seasoning instead of actual broth.  Thoughts on improvement: 1. A sign by the sidewalk. You can miss the entrance to the parking lot very easily at night 2. Probably could use a waitress to see if the customers need anything. There was one person doing everything from orders, bringing out food to basically... everything."}
{"text":"Okay, I have been going to this place for awhile, and I have introduced a couple people to this little spot and they always love it.  It is really good, but I am a picky vegetarian.  I decided to ask if they could tailor their no no pad thai for me, and they did.  It was amazing.  I wish I had more healthy options in this area, but now I have an awesome healthy option right down the street.  This place is great for take out, but if you do sit down, try their strawberry boba cocktail!  It is not traditional tapioca, it has bursts of strawberry in bubbles, it is so good!  Parking is limited, but I have never not found a space."}
{"text":"Great food,delicious pad Thai, great staff They were friendly and very helpful. Cannot wait to go back and try other dishes. Don't miss the fresh rolls and dragon eggz Glad to have seen the article in the paper cause we now have a new place to go!"}
{"text":"Drove right past it. It is worth finding. Meat was good quality and the flavors were great. Only thing I would change is give me a choice of how spicy. It was good for my wife but i like it a little lower on the heat."}
{"text":"My new go to Thai restaurant! I like the different veggies they add to their curry dishes like eggplant and pumpkin. The curry sauce is a little different than the other Thai places I've ordered from. It's a little thicker, but still very tasty! Make sure to add their coconut sticky rice...such a delicious add on.  They are fairly affordable and I love that they have a pick up window for ordering ahead of time. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great Little Secret Hideaway on Thomas Rd just off Scottsdale Rd. Looks from outside are totally deceiving looks like an ice cream / coffee shop from the road, Authentic Cuisine, Great Food, , Great Value, Full Bar, Great Presentation, Friendly Staff, Moderately Priced. $25 per person with appetizer and Drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been there twice in the past month and thoroughly enjoyed it! Gotta love the Dragon Eggs. I'm so glad there's a decent Thai place in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Called in a takeout order and was told it would be 15 minutes, showed up 20 minutes later to find out that the lady had forgot about our order. After waiting another 15 minutes for our food, there were literally 2 pieces of shrimp in my shrimp fried rice. Food was good, everything else sucked."}
{"text":"To say I'm an avid Thai foodie would be like saying bears kind of enjoy honey. I am VERY impressed with the service, cleanliness, presentation of the food and the taste was spectacular as well. I recommend this place as one of the best. Whatever you do, don't judge the book by its cover. It's pure artistry."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and a tiny patio too!  It was too cold to sit outside, so inside it was!  I ordered a Thai ice tea.  YUM, and it was a big cup compared to other Thai places.  I got the peanut butter chicken.  Really good!  Love the vibe and service here!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is hidden on the busy Thomas road. From the outside, it looks more like a fast food joint rather than a sit-down restaurant. In fact, you can order ahead of time and pick up via drive-through. Better though, it also has a few nice seats and tables inside.   The food is authentic and flavorful. We ordered papaya salad, Tom Yum soup (spicy/sour soup with mushrooms and shrimps), Pad See Ew (stir fried noodles), and sticky rice. The shrimps in tom yum soup were big and fresh. The Pad See Ew was on the sweet side, which we are not used to. In some Thai restaurants, we have experienced \"old\" oil in the stir fried noodles. Thaiger doesn't have such a problem and the wide noodles were yummy and well-cooked. The sticky rice was served with coconut sauce on the top, a nice, sweet surprise.   Overall, great food but a bit on the pricey side (given the location and atmosphere)."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, the staff is super friendly, but the food and drinks are super ok. I really want to like this place, I do, but the food is mediocre. I will admit though, everything is cheap and reasonably priced so if I wanted cheap and quick asian food I would go here again. The rice bowls are decently good, and the thai-styled burger was actually fairly delicious; however their thai tea was disappointing. The boba also tasted weird and mushy, not how other boba normally tastes.   Don't knock this place until you try it though, this is just my opinion and the restaurant is still in its infancy :) I will definitely try this place again in the future to see if it improves!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! I love this place! The owner is so inviting and nice. The food is delicious. I had the spring roll and pad Thai and it was out so quickly. Probably the fastest I've been seated and served in a restaurant. Just the right amount of crunch and flakiness in the spring roll. The flavor in the pad Thai was perfect, not too spicy, and the presentation was very eye catching. Young and hip decor, and they serve alcohol. Two thumbs up and five stars. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"The Thai tea was great.  The two dishes we ordered had a strong taste of fish.  Unfortunately, we ordered beef.  We returned our uneaten food and would have loved to have it replaced, but instead we received a bill."}
{"text":"My husband and I typically eat here a few times a month, so I think it's time we give them some praise. My husband loves the dragon rolls, you can get them half crispy/half steamed! (The way to go). We typically avoid wheat in our house, so we love the gluten free pad thai. All of the curries are great, even the 24k which I wasn't expecting. We order take out almost exclusively, so I can't comment on their waiting service or atmosphere. However they are always quick, friendly and yummy! We highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is dialed. Their attention to detail and flavor is spectacular. I love visiting this place and always go off of the server's recommendation and it has always been fantastic. My only \"complaint\" is the service, although friendly, can be a bit slow. I guess I need to listen to my mom here, \"Good things take a while\" and this is PLENTY good so it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had Pad Thai - as usual - and my hubs had the Beef Panang. He said he was pretty good. I'm no expert in Pad Thai but the bean sprouts, green onions and other fodder were not cooked in with the noodles and the chicken was laid on top in huge slivers. Taste was great presentation was just a bit off for me. We would come back if we're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Small place, but always great customer service. I also like that there is a drive thru window for pick up. Love the pad Thai and the Thai iced coffee!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my hubby. The small outdoor patio caught our eye and we're always looking for a new Thai spot. OMG this was good!!   We both got a combo. Hubby got the peanut chicken which was out of this world good. I got the Panang curry, swapping out the beef for chicken. I love hot spicy Thai food and this did not disappoint. I usually need to add a good helping of red chili pepper sauce to get the heat to my liking, this came out perfect! Love the soup that comes with the combo-very good!!  Service was perfect, food came out very quickly.   We will definitely be back, and are already making plans to visit the parent restaurant, The Wild Thaiger, in the very near future."}
{"text":"i am sorry to say it only takes one bad experience to put a bad taste in your mouth. i had ordered a favorite, but it came wrong and was poorly made..dont order on a monday. i called and let them know. a lovely gal apologized and said to come in next time and it will be comped.  very cool.. until i called and they refused to honor the graciousness of their staff member.. they were like, too bad.  my feeling is this no way to treat a reg customer.. there are other thai restaurants.. im in the service industry... shame on little thaiger.not good service at all. they have lost not only my business.. but others will follow."}
{"text":"Best panang ever! Love the dragon eggs too. Get them half and half - half steamed and half fried. I usually pick up and sometimes it takes a little long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new places to get a fabulous bite to eat!  I'll start by saying that the service was spot on.  They were prompt, kind and knowledgeable about the menu.  Now the food.  I had the Peanut Passion, the veggies were cooked from fresh and were cooked perfectly.  The pork was so tender that we were cutting it with our forks!  My lover had the Tom Ka Gai, which is a typical Thai soup, but this recipe was hand down some of the best I have had.  The best part of this place is that it is only a mile and a half from my home!  I cannot wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that is located very close to work so we had to try it out for lunch. It's a little difficult to get to and when we walked in the decor was a bit odd but the food is really good!! I ordered the candy chicken and my friend the curry chicken. They both had the right amount of spice and very flavorful. The employees were also very friendly. I am definitely going back because I want to try the Pho. Oh and they are very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The Thai Inferno was not terrible, but they were out of cheese.  The pad thai chicken medium spice was bland and spiceless yet had a very peculiar off-taste like a chemical. The prig king ordered with pork came with chicken mistakenly. Asked for the ** hot spice and certainly was beyond that... *** Thai hot. Included mushy eggplant, too, which was not in the description. Ordered for take out, we ate the burger and threw out most of the rest. Certainly disappointing considering the prices are above average for Thai and other Asian dishes. The staff was friendly and upon leaving stated \"hope you like it!\" Unfortunately, we did not."}
{"text":"Looks like Dairy Queen after a makeover, but a good makeover. Lots to look at, great peanut chicken and the soup was really tasty. We want to go back and explore this menu more but we just needed a light lunch. I will add to this after we hit it again. Make sure you stay while you eat or you will miss all the neat little items that decorate this place. They were polite and friendly, helpful with the menu items."}
{"text":"We're from out of town and stopped in for a bite. I had no idea that they were on Guy Fieri's  show. Place was clean and service was nice. Food tasted fresh and the spice level is on point. It's not a place to eat quickly, but I don't mind the wait for good food. I just wish I had the stomach to try more dishes."}
{"text":"The two stars are for comfy seats, mediocre service, and soda. We ordered the fire rice or whatever its called and shrimp pad Thai. Rice was cold, end of story. Had to send it back. The pad Thai was sweet, I could barely get through it. Very disappointed in the quality of food, I'll not be returning"}
{"text":"Authentic THAI FOOD this is really flavorful and fresh... I will definitely come back. I got me the egg plant pumpkin curry with green beans... delishhhhhh 10 star"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this restaurant pop up in this spot, so I could not wait to give it a try. Today was that day! We ordered the Yellow Curry Rice bowl with chicken, the Kama Ramen, an boba Thai Iced tea. My dish was the ramen and I was very underwhelmed. The noodles were not traditional ramen noodles and the broth was ok ,  but improved when I added salt. If you are a Ramen fanatic, don't waste your taste buds on this. My sister had the Curry. It had really good flavor and some spice to it. There was plenty of chicken and  a nice amount of chunky veggies. Our boba teas were disappointing. They did not have the flavors we initially wanted. When they came, the bobas were not cooked enough and some were crunchy. Besides that, the flavor of the teas were good. Another bonus is that they have a drive-thru,  which is a great option if you have a baby in the car like me.   I may give this place another shot, but I'm not hurrying back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My sister introduced me to this spot and I'm so glad she did! It's a bit hidden so I wouldn't have spotted it, but the service was attentive and friendly, and the food was great. We got the pad thai and mu yang (see photos) and were super satisfied. In fact I was too full for dessert, but there were some amazing looking cheesecakes and things on display...and I want to try their mango & sticky rice! So I will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had in a long time. We ordered the dragon eggz, super soup, gai katchu, and mu yang. The Gai Katchu was my favorite, but everything was great! I don't think you can go wrong."}
{"text":"The De-Cha Boar is really good. I am Thai, grew up eating Thai food and have been searching for authentic Thai food in Phoenix. This dish hit the spot and is something that could have come out of my mom or aunty's kitchen. Satisfyingly spicy and great flavors."}
{"text":"Wowza! Stopped here with a friend I hadn't seen since we were in Bangkok together 5 years ago. I can't resist a freshly made Papaya salad and the one here is fantastic! We also shared fresh spring rolls (at the suggestion of our server) and an order of green curry with chicken. Service was outstanding!  Food fresh and delicious! We had planned to stop at their location on Central but traffic was crazy so we opted for the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"We tried this place because we saw their marketing on a truck in our neighborhood. We looked it up and realized it was not even a mile from our house. It is the BEST place for Thai take-out!! Fresh, spicy, affordable, fast, and yummy. Love having this place in South Scottsdale. Try the green curry with Thai pumpkin... AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here, it doesn't disappoint! I tried the fried banana today and omg, it's amazing!! Take out is a breeze from here, and they are both creative and intelligent in the kitchen. They vented the to go containers that contained crispy items...first time I've seen anyone this genius! Homemade coconut ice cream, mu yang, pad siew, corn fritters, all amazing! Definitely don't skip out on the dessert here, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came in with my friends for lunch. I thought it was a sushi place but no. \"It's Thai \" says the guy behind the counter   This is an Asian fusion fast food type set up. It's relaxing and modern with curry noodles rice and specialty dishes on the menu board  I got Thai ferno burger. Not good and should be removed from menu. Their are simply too many burger places popping up that make a better patty RB got peanut chicken and he gives it a three. Lack of sauce made the dish dry with all the sticky rice D got green curry. She gave a four We shared pork dumpling. Big tasting. We got steamed. The server said they are better fried. Two or three make a meal and you get six for $8  They are fast and bring the food to your table. We sat outside."}
{"text":"First time there, got the chicken pad Thai plus broccoli. My plate was half cabbage and carrot garnish, the rest included a ball of dry noodles 4 bits of chicken and 4 pcs of broccoli. Thought maybe it would at least taste good, but nope, next to no flavor. Go to Sa Bei or Thai Lahna. Oh, and this was $14. Maybe just a one time thing, bad luck."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant on Thomas! It's right near old town but kind of hard to see due to the trees. I've been here twice and I have missed the turn the first time and almost again.   The food has been great here! Just service has been iffy for me which makes me give one less star.  I came here for dinner time the first time and I had the peanut passion with brown rice. When they asked me between the type of rice I wanted, I chose brown which they did not state it was an extra cost.  Also there was a large party there and as I was eating by myself, they only came up to me once. My water wasn't filled either.. I felt ignored and that if I were to ever go again, I would just order for pick up. But I guess the service is a hit or miss. This was a few months back.  I came here about 2 weeks ago with a friend because she's seen it and wanted to try it so we came for dinner. We got the dragon eggs which is like shumai. Tasty!  I also had the beef panang and man it was spicy for a 2 chili pepper. I can't imagine if it was a 3 chili pepper rating meal.. It was delicious though :)  The service was better and we actually got checked up on a couple of times.  Not ignored like the last time..   So overall, great food that even Guy Fieri gave them props.  Just service can be a hit or miss depending on your server I'm guessing."}
{"text":"A small little Asian fusion restaurant with big flavor!  My fiance and brother in law came here on a whim for lunch. The decor is perfect for otakus and charming for new comers. My fiance had the candy chicken and it was absolutely delicious. The breading on the chicken was light but flavorful! I had the noodle pad Thai and it was yummy! The pad Thai was not traditional but they gave huge pieces of shrimp. My brother in law had the chicken satay and said it was good.  The location is a little awkward and the restaurant is small but it was completely worth it."}
{"text":"What an amazing surprise you'll find in this little spot. Weekend it was affiliated by the Wild Thaiger on Central, so we expected a delicious and creative mean. We were not disappointed. We started with cocktails, which we're perfectly prepared. The organic cucumber martini was a cool distraction to the spicier foods. We started with corn fritters - whole kernels of corn blended in a sweet/spicy light batter - and fresh roles with shrimp and chicken. Both were delicious, the corn fritters well worth driving across town for! We then had the Phuket Sea food Fantasea and the Mi Dang. The seafood was delicious and fresh and served over rice noodles with vegetables. The red beef, vegetables and noodles in the Mi Dang were fantastic and both sweet and spicy. The service was impeccable, our waitress was simply lovely. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is my new go to Thai restaurant. The 24 K is one of the most amazing dishes I have ever had! It is a spicy green chili curry with Kabocha pumpkin, Japanese eggplant, string beans, and bamboo shoots. And when I say spicy, I mean spicy, which is perfect for people like me who love spicy food. The Suh Noi Salad was refreshing, filled with fresh greens, tomatoes, cucumber, and even snow peas. I love the drive thru option and service is on point."}
{"text":"Really terrible experience. I knew it was a bad idea to eat here when I saw the Pokémon mural and anime posters but I decided to give it a try anyway. I ordered and my food came out tasting like they covered it in maple syrup and served it to me. The waiter came by and asked how everything was and I told him honestly- he walked away and did not take my feedback at all, and did not take the item off my bill. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of the best Thai places I have been to, are there are many across the country. This place is the smaller one in Scottsdale saw it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives thought I'd try it been there three or four times since then probably once a week everything is prepared to order Super Fresh pretty spicy it's not the easiest place to find you can drive by it but if you're on Tomas Road it's right past Scottsdale Road but you got to look for it it's worth stopping at if you like Thai food you'll love this place"}
{"text":"This place deserved the visit from Guy Fieri - the menu is simple and authentic. They have over 5 types of pad Thai (but the pad see eu noodles are just as good!). I love that the shrimp in their dishes is grilled well, and easy to enjoy if you're not a huge seafood fan. Great for takeout"}
{"text":"First time eating in. Pad Thai ordered \"hot.\" It was fantastic. Loved it. I'll try \"Thai\" hot next time. Service was great. Staff is super friendly. Dining room is quaint and eclectic. We love that they're in the neighborhood. This could become a habit. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Seriously, portion sizes are just right and it's right off of the cooktop. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I still give 5 stars because the food continues to be awesome;  however, on our most recent order to go over $54 by the way the service was lacking.  I call in the order and I'm told 20 minutes.   20 minutes later I send my boyfriend to pick up the food and 50 minutes later my boyfriend is still waiting for the food which he paid for when he got there.  After the waiter/hostess helped 3 other customers and completely ignored our food sitting on the counter my boyfriend finally got her attention and was able to get our food that had been sitting for 20 minutes.   Cold Surf and Turf is not good.   Please consider your customer service skills Shu Noi."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for take out.  I found them on Yelp and yet again Yelp didn't give me the wrong advice. It's pretty convenient to get to from my apartment and the drive through window to pick up the to go orders is super nice to not have to run in.    I always get the glass noodles with chicken and they always have such good flavor. I'm a huge spice person and the spicier the better for me.  Whenever I call to order they are pretty right on for the time estimate and there isn't usually a line of cars or anything. Definitely recommend for Thai in the area."}
{"text":"The Service is awful..do not go there expecting the service of a caring restaurant. It's only a take out restaurant with no concern for the folks actually eating in the restaurant. I can't comment on the food because it's been close to forty five minutes and still haven't been served."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem is so cute, found out about it on Yelp and the name and the interior is what drew me to Suh Noi! I guess this place was featured on the food network show Diners and drive- Thrus? Or something like that I am not sure. But it's interior is way different inside its like a nice hip lounge nice lighting and view of the patio and drive thru! You can sit at a table of 4 or or 2 or even at the bar for a nice drink special. You sit yourself, when I went only one waiter at the time but I came after a lunch special rush so I didn't get any special lunch meals since I missed out! I always order pad Thai and a appetizer so I got papaya salad and the pad Thai with chicken l, didn't usually get asked how hot I wanted it but I asked for it to be Thai hot to see how authentic it really was! To my surprise papaya salad was good very sweet but a bit of spice which I like very delicious. Next was the pad Thai with chicken.. Now everything looked so delicious I love the cooks aesthetic for her plates so good to eat and look at I like that! I can definitely tell it was gonna be hot they used thai chili peppers on my dish and it was spicy every bite I did enjoy it! But let's just say Thai hot is really, really hot! Now watch out! But luckily I washed it down with my green tea which was delicious as well! Definitely love the fun anime background murals and cute deco the bar area has! Service was delightful and the chefs/cooks are awesome definitely found a new Thai space here in south Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for four people. Was told it would be 20 minutes, but it ended up being almost 40. I can already tell some of the food got cold by the time they finished making the last dish. Jury's still out on the food, but the wait time alone has me angry enough."}
{"text":"Loved the steam dragon eggs as was as the peanut chicken. Everyone of us enjoyed our meals. Definitely going to be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good! I love Thai food and they nailed the flavors. We noticed a drive thru so I will be coming here more often. We had a gift certificate so we thought to try it and I'm glad we did. We ordered at the cashier and the girl there was very helpful in deciding what we wanted. We got the Pad thai, Beef Panang, and the Prig King. They were all really tasty! The only thing about it was that the portion is pretty small. I mean we each got a plate and had to go across the street to Taco Bell to order a couple Tacos each. When we told the girl bringing us our food (which came out pretty fast) that the portion is on the small side she said that the portions will be getting bigger the following day. We couldn't believe it! We missed it by a day. But overall, the food was great and the cashier was helpful so I will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have came on lunch a ton of times. I oringally found this place on yelp. I always get the dragon eggs for an app half and half . I do highly recommend beef and broccoli. The Thai ice tea is also good.   Whenever I have came on lunch I can usually get in and out within 45 minutes expect on Fridays. Friday's tends to take a bit longer then usually with how busy they are. The food is always good. I have been there at least 15 times this year. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I'll be relocating to the area real soon from California and I wanted to check this place out after seeing it on triple D. I wasn't disappointed and this place is going to be my \"go to\" Thai restaurant. The presentation of each plate was beautiful and the flavors were yummy. We ordered Pad Thai, Dragon Eggs (half and half), and Satay Sampler for dinner and we had the sticky rice with mango for dessert. Enjoyed every bite of it all. The Chef/Owner was gracious enough to come to our table to serve us one of our dishes and talk to us. Overall...great service...great food...awesome people!"}
{"text":"I got this place for lunch while on my lunch break and thought it was pretty good! Ive never had thai before but I feel like this is a great place for first timers... I got the noodles and chicken and thought it was a very basic thai food plate. This place was packed during lunch and I suspect it to be packed during dinner time!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is awesome. Pad thai, panang and the yellow curry are all yummy. My all time favorite is the tom ka soup, delicious. They also do a combo meal so you can get the soup on the side with once of the curries. If you are looking for a caffeine kick the thai tea and coffee hit the spot. They also have a drive through, i would call ahead for big orders although it probably only tool them 20 minutes to get my order ready."}
{"text":"Found this place driving from a cafe in Scottsdale. The inside is decorated with anime art. Food took a bit but was worth the wait. Delicious pad thai garnished with beets, bean sprouts and peanuts. One of the better pad thais I've had."}
{"text":"I have brought so many people to this sweet spot who also become addicted to their fresh and delicious food! I love their curry dish. But also savor their half rack of Asian ribs that comes with steamed vegetables and rice. Their ambiance is relaxing. I love the music that they play -- not too loud and over powering."}
{"text":"I thought Thai joints on the corner were reserved for places like San Fran or NYC?  So about a month ago, the parent restaurant, Thaiger, on Central Ave. was featured on Guy's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. You'll figure that out about as fast as I did because of all the signed posters and TVs showing the episode throughout the restaurant.   TIP: they don't have a drive-thru but they do offer pick up at their converted drive-thru window.  Disclaimer: I know there are a lot of Thai food snobs out there and I'll be straight forward and tell you I'm not one of them. I just like food that tastes good regardless if it's \"authentic\".  That being said, the food did taste good and I'll be back. I asked the girls at the register what we their most popular dish and ended up with the two menu items featured on Guy's show, dragon eggs and mu yang.   The green papaya salad was good with the right amount of heat. I had half the dragon eggs steamed and the other half fried. Both were good and in the future I'll get all steamed -- personal preference. The chicken skewers were tender and the sticky rice was also tasty and lived up to its name.   I'm looking forward to trying more items. Another TIP: I grabbed the menu pamphlet and will to carry out from the window."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying everyone is SOOOO nice! And the place is pretty cute, sets the mood for a fun date or just to meet up with friends.   Parking is a little rough since its so small and you have to park in the back or side of building.   Food... well it was my first time there and I seemed to be the first to order their new menu item 'the glazed shrimp in veggies with a side of clear noodles' and MY TASTE BUDS WENT WILD! So yummy, I was soo full but I just couldn't stop eating it! And might I mention it was a huge dish now I understand why it was $15. Still very pricey though but the taste made up for it.   I will be going back very soon, don't be afraid to try something new, I did and I loved it!"}
{"text":"This place has potential, and I hope they will do good in their business. I ordered a coconut soup, temple of fire (fried rice), Kimow (clear noodle), and a Thai tea. The coconut soup didn't taste too bad overall, however, it was over sweetened. It tasted like sweet coconut milk mixed with other staff.The temple of fire is way too spicy ( I love spicy food and I'm from Szechuan), but I couldn't handle the fried rice here. It gave me stomachache. The Kimow was average, a lot of noodles but minimum meat. The Thai tea was so sweet, I felt I was drinking syrups. The restaurant only has small round tables for two, Not convenient for group of three or more. It would be great if they allowed their customers to select spicy level (mild, median, hot, Thai hot etc.), otherwise it's too risky to order spicy dishes. I would get to go dishes from here, the actually dine/in portion is smaller other Thai restaurants' dishes anyway."}
{"text":"The food is amazing . The staff is crazy on point . However -- tonight tried calling 5 times all within an hour and they won't take orders to go . \" we are to busy\" regardless still made the trip here for some favorite dishes. Just very odd . Wonder how many they turned away not answering ?"}
{"text":"Have to go 5 stars. Small place in Scottsdale but highly rated on yelp and was a stop on Diners Drive Inns and Dives. Full bar and beers I'd never heard of- ordered a beer from Laos which came in  a nice frosty mug. Ordered the Dragon Eggz-which were dumplings with Pork, Shrimp and Crab with a fresh jalapeño slice- amazing. But the coup de grace came when I ordered the Thai Hot Wild Boar. And it was hot but with a nice flavor- not just stupid hot for the sake of it. Veggies were nicely done and the portion was perfect. I may regret my choice on my flight tomorrow but that was some of the best Thai I've had. I will be back."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday at 11am for Lunch. Party of 3, all ordered Chicken Pad Thai. It took about 40 minutes to receive our food. They might have been short on cooks or something but regardless, the wait was pretty long despite we were the only other customers along.  When the food came, the presentation was decent. Lots of curly string carrots, bean sprouts and shredded cabbage. Mixed it all together and went to town. Taste was decent 8/10.   The environment is nice and modern. There are some interesting desserts and they serve alcohol which most other Thai places typically do not."}
{"text":"Good food very mediocre service. I LOVE the candy chicken. The soup is great too. That's about all I've tried but my friends have ordered other things and had very positive things to say. The staff is very friendly but not the most competent. It took a very long time for someone to take my order at the drive thru and an oddly long time to get my food. Another time when I walked in for take out, it seemed like a bunch of the staff's friends were just hanging out and it made ordering a little awkward bc they weren't paying attention to the customers. And they got my order wrong that time. I ordered mochi, but they gave me a slushi thing. I wasn't that angry though, because it turned out to be delicious. So go for awesome, inexpensive, easy food, but don't expect the same level of amazingness from the service. Just be patient and all will be well."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch, the server was super friendly and suggested great items, the menu is small but has a lot of selection. We had Thai Tea which was so good along with papaya salad, pad Thai w/ chicken, and chicken curry. Everything was really flavorful and better than other locations down the way. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch with a Groupon.  EXCELLENT FOOD!! We had Candy Chicken with jasmine rice and Chicken Curry with brown rice as well as the Ton Ka Gai soup.  They were all so delicious!!  The portion sizes are substantial.  The only difficult thing about the location is that you have to enter from Thomas going westbound (a median prohibits from entering going eastbound).  I can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant!  Ingredients are always super fresh and the flavors are amazing.   I highly recommend the Dragon eggs as an appetizer.  The peanut sauce on the Peanut Passion is unbelievably good."}
{"text":"Wow! Beautiful presentation, excellent flavor. Spotless restaurant. I can see why Guy Fieri made this a stop on his TV show. I will be craving this food forever. Very small parking lot. They do have a kids menu too."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Came here tonight and got the corn fritters and Mu Yang! Both are total gems! The corn fritters are TO DIE FOR!  Such an interesting little spot! The ambiance is pretty casual, with a few TVs running and anime decor everywhere. However, you are served by a waitress, and the food is so good you'd think you're somewhere much fancier!   I got the peanut passion, which is chicken with veggies and peanut sauce. It was so yummy, perfect with a Thai iced tea. A few of my friends got the pad Thai and said it was awesome. I want to come back to try a hot pot, too. Everything is really reasonably priced.   They have a little drive up window, which you can use by calling ahead and then driving-thru to pick it up.   Definitely want to come back here, and soon!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. However with saying that we waited 50 minutes for our food as their teenage wait staff ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. The service is terrible. I wouldn't come back unless I had 2 hours to spare for dinner. As we waited for our food we watched 3 different sets of people walk in and wait and then walk out because nobody ever greeted them or anything and they even had 2 open tables. Too confusing of a set up with no hostess to seat people. I can't imagine they will be in business for too much longer. Their location downtown is far better."}
{"text":"Very fast service and they spice everything perfectly. 2 pepper hot rating is perfect and not over the top racing for water constantly. The seafood panang dish is amazing. We normally get Tom Yum seafood soup and panang curry and this dish was an amazing marriage of the two!"}
{"text":"Best Thai take out in Old Town. Always fresh, always delicious. So glad this place is right around the corner, we've dined in and taken out, they are always good!"}
{"text":"Loved the chicken curry!! Service and atmosphere was great. This is an awesome spot for lunch or dinner, so glad we tried it out."}
{"text":"Grrrr-eat!  I enjoyed the Curry Soup and Chix Pad Thai! Perfect spice level!  Delightful young lady served our meals.  This is a breath of fresh air in South Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The dragons here are great they like giant egg rolls.  Over the food is pretty good the atmosphere is nice but it's a very small"}
{"text":"Amazing Penang Beef and a cool little atmosphere! Very small place the food is right on par with the larger version. Friendly servers."}
{"text":"Found it on Yelp... Usually get Thai from a different Old Town Scottsdale restaurant. Glad I tried this. I read reviews and since I was ordering takeout, the drive through window for pick up got me to choose here.  Everything was excellent. The soup,  pad Thai, pork sticks, GF items, the chicken tender... And nothing was very spicy despite how it sounded on the menu. Some who wanted more spice added it. It worked out perfectly. Will def eat here again.  While sitting at the drive through, couldn't help but notice how cute the place is, and the patio looked great."}
{"text":"Pretty good for Arizona Thai food. Had a few dishes to go. Food was fresh and tasty but just not as good as it is in other cities. This is a sister restaurant of there one in Central Phoenix. Friendly fast helpful service. I would give them 3.5 Stars I wonder when Yelp will wake up and realize there is more than complete Stars. Even when they put their reviews together you get half Stars so why not let us at least have that or even down to the quarter of a star. #wakeupyelp"}
{"text":"I give Suh Noi's food taste 4 stars, service 2 stars, so 3 stars is my rating. I did not like Thai food enough to go to a Thai restaurant.  When I was in Thailand for 6 weeks, I could not eat the Thai food, cos it was too hot and gave me serious diarrhea enough to cause me to lose 12 lbs when I came back to USA.  I had to eat Australian and Italian food in Thailand.    But I went with a Greater Phoenix Ethnic Lunch MeetUp to Suh Noi because people said it was so good, and it was so close to my house (about 3 miles).  I ordered the fried catfish ($13).   It was SOOOOOOO GOOD, I am rather obsessing over it.  People said the lunch special soup was so good.  I wanna go to Suh Noi again to have lunch special which includes the soup.  We had 12 in our MeetUp for lunch party for 1 pm on Thurs.  There were only 2 other occupied tables, one with 2 people, other with 3.  I felt the service was bad, like the reviews said.  They could not serve all of us about the same time.  Some of us got our food 40 min after others got their entrees, and we kept telling the server that we were so hungry, when is our food coming.  Soon Soon.    It's coming!   Of course people in our party were done eating, when others were still waiting for their entrees (me!  I was last person to get my order).    I looked at my watch.  By the time I got my order, I had been sitting in that restaurant for an hour.   Furthermore, I observed that the other tables had already turned over twice, and they came later than we did, and got their food sooner, and then ate and left, before some of us in our party (ME !) even got our food.  Made me \"jealous\", cos I was so hungry.    Also I asked for a dish of lemon wedges (for me to make lemonade) and I think it took 20 min and reminding, to get my lemon wedges, which meant I did not drink my water, cos I was waiting for my lemon wedges.    I think if Suh Noi could have great service, they would be one of those rare 5 star restaurants that I give.    But the fried catfish was SOOOO GOOD and I felt they gave me a lot of fish, too, the portion was generous!    I later went back on another day and ordered the lunch special.  I felt the portion was very small for the price, compared to another new Thai restaurant Thai Long-An.  Parking is very limited, but you can park in horseshoe around the sides and back of the building, even though it says No Parking."}
{"text":"When I don't have time to sit down at the Wild Thaiger this is where I go to get my fill. They have my favorites, dragon eggs, Penang curry, and papaya salad. Never a wait and the service is quick."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was so happy when I saw this place pop up in this location. This area of south Scottsdale needs more cool local spots.   When I lived in downtown phx, my favorite Thai restaurant was wild thaiger. Now I am able to get awesome food at just a stones throw.   This spot is tiny. There are about 5 tables and a quaint outdoor patio. The decor is interesting and modern. Bright white, cool lighting, pink details.   The food is wonderful. I would highly recommend the pad sea ewe. It is some of the best I've ever had. We also got the dragon eggs appetizer and it was OKAY. I was a little underwhelmed with the flavor.  Note: the lunch specials are only valid mon-fri   I am interested in going back in the evening maybe getting a few beers and sitting on the patio.   I will be back many times."}
{"text":"Guys, can we please talk about this place? If you've ever had the pleasure of eating at Wild Thaiger in Downtown Phoenix, you'll be familiar with the deliciousness being served at Suh Noi The Little Thaiger; same chef/owner, same menu. This place is proof that great things come in small packages. Everything is delicious. I want to write this review in all caps because I feel like screaming it from the rooftops! This chef/owner knows Thai cuisine like the back of her hand, and she uses all the glorious flavors of Thailand and whips them into something incredibly tasty and beautiful! She truly is an artist.   I always (always) order a Freshie Roll and Dragon eggs (served steamed or crispy). These appetizers are my absolute favorites and I refuse to go without them!   My favorite entrees are the Mu Yang (marinated pork skewers served with sticky rice & papaya salad), the Peanut Passion (chicken breast smothered in Thai peanut sauce, served with a flavorful veggie medley and jasmine rice) and the Pad Sie Ew (fat egg noodle, pork or chicken, stir fried veggies in a sweet soy).   I'll stop rambling, but do yourself a major favor and go. The service is always friendly and accommodating and the food has never once disappointed me. I bring all my favorite people here for a reason."}
{"text":"I heard about it from Diners Drive is and dives.  I needed to be the judge though. I ordered the panang beef.  I rarely give 5 stars, and if I'm being honest the 5 stars was for the panang beef, as this was my first time here. I could taste the kafir lime leaves, lemon grass, Thai basil, and coconut milk all singing, because it was so fresh.  The service was unassuming and the restaurant clean and pleasant. The presentation was perfect.  I could have gone to Hooters or Applebee's and spent the same amount, this is so much more.  I'll pull in here anytime I'm nearby."}
{"text":"Probably the best Panang I've ever had outside Thailand.  The staff are super hard working, and the kitchen is off the hook talented.  The place is weird as far as look and function but the quality of food supersedes any hang ups you may have of a converted Wendy's made into a neon, white leather, plastic plates interior.  In a way it reminds me of what being in Thailand really feels like, especially in this AZ heat!  You'd be crazy not to give this place a try, the food really is next level authentic."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the food or the head chef who personally came out to greet us. My dad has eaten Thai food all over the world including Thailand and says it's the best soup he ever had. Check this place out if ever in Scottsdale. You won't be disappointed. Featured in Guy Fieri's diners, drive-ins and dives"}
{"text":"I am a return Peace Corps volunteer from Thailand, which, for better or worse, has made me a Thai food snob. I had the Thai basil stir fry (pat gra-pap) and the drunken noodles (pat kee-Mao). Both were very delicious and when I asked the owner for Thai style she made sure to spice it up with Thai chillies (prik kee nuu). They both had the perfect balance of spiciness, saltiness and sweetness that you should expect from Thai food. The food was very reasonably priced and the owner/cook was out taking to the patrons which made it an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Cumin at you HOT! I am in the area for work and stopped in for some spice. The leeetle Thaiger did not disappoint! Service was great, atmosphere was calm and welcoming. I liked the artwork and anime, fun! Food came out as works of art, flavorful and balanced. I didn't need to clean out my sinuses today with heat so I stayed in the medium, medium hot range today. (I know, risk taker!) has the dragon eggs and chicken pad Thai and the iced green tea. Affordable lunch place. I'd cumin again if work was in the area. (See what I did there?)"}
{"text":"So much enjoyment packed into this tiny establishment. Each time we have visited with two or six guests, we are served promptly and service continued to be great.  Every dish ordered was fresh, tasty and just what we hoped.  Dragon eggs are wonderful with large portions of shrimp, pork and crab.  The crab island appetizer is served cold and stuffed into a crisp wonton.  The crab ingredients were wonderful.  Both items are highly recommended and we will order them again in the future.  Main entrees were happily customized in terms of spiciness and the best ingredients were used for each entree.  Chicken pad Thai, Holy Basil, Candy chicken and the peanut dish with peanut sauce were outstanding.  Holy Basil was spicey yet our guest enjoyed all she could eat.  Our server offered to prepare something else in lieu of the spicey dish but our guest was happy to enjoy what she was served.  Great atmosphere, pleasant staff, fresh food enjoyed by all!  Thank you, Suh Noi. We will be back."}
{"text":"I loved this place, even though it replaced one of my favorite street taco joints. I had the tofu pad thai (vegetarian), and it was perfect. Very spicy (as requested), the tofu was perfectly fried. I had the Thai tea, which was weird, but it was my first one. I'll be back!"}
