{"text":"A lot has changed since my last visit in summer 2014. We ate here for Mother's Day during the late afternoon. It was completely dead, which is odd for this establishment. The menu was reduced, and furthermore, they didn't have many of their dishes available. I had to settle for my 3rd option. They only had Coors on tap, and house red for wine options (which was warm and disgusting) - a huge downgrade from their usual selection. I was baffled. What happened ? Not coming back.."}
{"text":"What ever happened to the nice italian? After changing hands (once again in a few years), our last visit was beyond disappointing. The old crispy calamari and shrimp have been substituted with frozen seafood (a hot mess!). Pastas were so greasy almost inedible, penne a la vodka now has sausage?  And the kids didn't touch their pasta (simple penne w butter), how can you mess that up? There was a soup of butter at the bottom of their plate.  Never coming back!"}
{"text":"We went here for almost every South American World Cup match. Our table would spend about $300-$700 dollars each time and still.. The service was TERRIBLE.
The waitresses were very rude, one girl would complain about her job and other customers to us.
We would sit with a bunch of empty bottles and empty plates for 30 mins..

This place is close to home but I'd still rather brave the traffic and go downtown

The food was a 2/10 
Service 1/10"}

Terrible Service, So-So food - STAY AWAY

Went to every Eurocup game here, expect the final because the owner's son said they were not making reservations when I made it (3 days before); funny because I filled out a form and handed it to the waitress. The guy said, well it's not the restaurants fault, it was the waitress' for taking your reservation.
When I got to the restaurant they basically said, good luck finding a table somewhere else and the owner's son walked away. They are very unprofessional.
This was my local option for games and what not, because drinks are drinks, however not anymore.
The food, was not very good either.
-Calamari was overcooked and tasted like old oil
-Pizza is kind of dry and flavourless
-Caesar Salad dress was made with sugar, it is really weird when you first taste the dressing and it's sweet
If you want crappy service and equally as crappy food, have a good time."}
{"text":"Pub italien, sportif très sympa! l'ambiance y est cosy et décontracte avec des télé qui retransmettent le sport et un fond de musique juste comme il faut!

Plat typiques italiens et dessert totalement américains avec des cheesecakes ! 

Le service a été parfait et surtout la baguette à volonté c'est une merveille pour tout bon français qui se respecte!
le prix est très abordable car j'ai mangé très bien pour 10$"}
