{"text":"Went here because it's really close to my apt. Love the food, beer and service. This is my new bar spot!"}
{"text":"With out question final round is my favorite local bar. The food is great, They offer a lot of daily specials,including $3 pitchers,half price Burger's are juicy and dee-lish) as well as .40cent wings (also dee-lish) and an all you can eat breakfast on Sundays. If your in Tempe and looking for a low key dive bar with great food and good times check out final round!"}
{"text":"Coming from California it's pretty difficult to choose the \"right\" place to eat with good food and service. Choosing Final Round was definitely a great choice. The food is beyond good and the service is really great. Everyone from the staff was welcoming and the place has a homey/ family bar feel to it. I had the burger, fries and wings which I think we're cooked extremely well. My gf got the cowboy burger which looked like a tower and she said was delicious. If you're looking for an easy going bar with awesome food, give it a try here."}
{"text":"It sits so inconspciously you can easily miss it if you don't know what you are looking for. Sitting at the headwaters of Mill Avenue, Final Round appears to be very much off the beaten path, a place favored mostly by international aid relief workers, representatives from Western energy coroporations, and the occasional tourist. Almost no one comes here by mistake. 

The design is very modest, although there is indoor plumbing. A very large colour television set christens one side of the room, buffeted by a few tables and booths. Opposite this is an imposing bar, and a small area for darts. It is far from tranquil though, and one occaison we were graced by a visit by none other than a roving band of the Ed Hardy Army. It was an impressive sight, even for this hardened war correspondent. The men flexed their muscles under exceedingly tight uniforms, their hats drawn so low over their faces as to obscure their very humanity. The women's physiques also burst at the seams, reinforcing the world's oldest pecking order. A sighting of the Army this far south in Tempe, however, cannot be a good sign. Decades of intergenerational conflict, cultural famine, and poor management of natural resources has left the local population with little means to cope, and the Army's presence can hardly be welcome.

Whatever compelled the raid, it likely was not the culinary diversity of Final Round. While the beer is indeed cold, and the food edible, it boasts a menu so small you would assume it was owned by a Scottish expat. I had heard good things about their wings but I never had the patience to try. Expect to find only the most traditional of bar food offerings here, and no local color aside from perhaps Four Peaks ale.

Service is also annoyingly slow. There is an honest explanation, for the Final Round has often only two people working the floorspace at any given time...and one is usually at the bar. The waitress is usually cheerful, if not overburdened...and that makes up for some of the delay. Still tensions have been known to rise as patrons anxiously await their food

Many presume the real motivation for the Army's visit was its rather low prices for pitchers of beer. That may be true, but the food is not a particular great value. However it won't burn a hole in anyone's pocket either. A recent model speaks to the managment's desire to change this perhaps, and appeal to a richer and more worldly clientele. But for now, heaven will have to wait, and life will continue on as it has in this part of the world for decades."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after reading reviews & was not disappointed. I travel to Tempe about 4 times/year and am always looking for local fare rather than traditional chains. Have to say first: the BEST bloody mary I've had in quite a while (if you like 'em spicy)! Service was good and friendly and the large groups of locals who obviously frequent the place were more than interesting to chat with. Warning: the cowboy burger is stacked a mile high so is not for the faint of appetite, but outstanding in flavor. Highly recommend giving this place a try if you're as sick as I am of chains with no creativity."}
{"text":"I arrived with a group of friends after a sporting event. We all put in orders for appetizers at the same time. After an hour had past and the people I came with had all got their orders as well as those who came after us I complained. I asked for the manager who immediately just asked if I would like to cancel my order. I said yes, and said this \"shit\" is ridiculous. Next thing I know security is requesting I leave. I guess I should know if the bar has security in combat tactical gear this place is ghetto. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, and decent environment,  but apparently the management needs a lesson with customer service.  Waited 45 minutes to get food. Maybe the staff could actually be able to to a good job and keep customers happy if 1 person wasn't serving the entire bar with food and drinks. I feel bad for the staff."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar and grill. The drinks are reasonable and the service is fantastic. Oh, and the food is not beside the point. It is extremely awesome and everyday there is a food special and it is never less than great. Oh, by the way did I mention that this was a bar and grill? Yes, the bartenders are friendly, quick and awesome. And the atmosphere is always fun whether it be happy hour or football season. Get yourself down here, you'll never regret it."}
{"text":"The BEST local bar in Tempe!!! Met the most coolest people there while on a weekend trip. Watched a lot of football, college & pro. Cheap beers, good food, GREAT people, what more could you want!? THANK YOU & we hope to see you all again soon."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat there today, we sat down at our table, grabbed the menus and menus had hundreds of ants on them. We threw the menus down on the table and left!!! Will never be back!!"}
{"text":"Just to make this clear on how bad this place sucks for karaoke, I am on my iPhone right now while I am here to right a review. I got off work at 10 and came by here for the first time cause I heard this place was awesome for karaoke. Little did I realize HOW wrong everyone was. I walk in and my ears start to bleed. The singers were a collection of the worst singers I've eve heard. The crowd was mainly made up of people twice my age, and I'm 26. The drink specials were decent but the bar was SMALL!  There are MAYBE 10 tables in the whole bar. I will NEVER come back here unless for some reason I really want to feel better about myself."}
{"text":"Strip Mall Gold... ok, maybe not actual gold but once you walk into  this hole in the wall, what-the-heck-is-a-bar doing here place, the drinks are so cheap you just might be stumbling out and after barely spending anything!

isn't fancy at all,  food is decent for a bar, the usual Cheers crew is always there. have karoke fridays and saturday nights but since i cant stand off tune singining i run out the door soon as it starts! haha... 

worth a try if you're strapped for cash and need to get your drink on"}
{"text":"Yup. Its a dive bar. Outdated and felt creepy. Bartender was a nice guy and really tried his best to convince us this was THE PLACE to be. Ummm.....we didn't have the heart to set him straight. Had one drink and done."}
{"text":"Seriously the best grilled wings you will EVER have. Spicy Asian! So good!

This is just a small hole in the wall bar. Everyday people and locals and get together at their favorite watering hole. 

The waitresses are really friendly and have been there for a while.

Friday nights is karaoke night. Other things to try are their Thin Crust Pizza and Burgers! Great prices on beer as well."}
{"text":"Cheap Drinks, Cool Staff, Friday Night Karaoke, More then interesting people"}
{"text":"Cozy, simple and friendly. I'm from Philadelphia and I honestly felt like I was back in the northeast in some old alley bar. Great service too and they were busy. Nice specials and cheap prices. People order pitchers and just drink out of the pitchers which is funny but cool."}
{"text":"Been here about 4 times and I must say, for a divey place they are consistent. 
Consistently good.

First time went during a Bar Olympics.  Competed and tied for 1st place, and got a gift certificate, so I had to go back to use it.  (Well played by the way).

Second time, went for Karaoke.  It was a little packed, and the wait to sing was a little long, but what do you expect?  Slipped a $5 bill to the DJ and got bumped up, every time I wanted to sing.  Learn to play the game folks.

Third time, just stopped in to watch some games on TV and chill out.

The last time was for New Years.  Figured it would be semi-busy.  Was I wrong!  The place was packed.  And everyone was dressed up and having a great time.  

Every time I've been, whether it was busy or slow, I was served very quickly, the bartenders/staff were friendly and very attentive.  The local crowd were nice, and the longer you stay, you feel like you're becoming a part of the family.  

I would probably go more often if I lived in the area.  I've only eaten wings there, but the rest of it looks pretty good, and my friends loved what they ordered to eat."}
{"text":"Chicken wings under cooked, juice squirted out as you bit into it...pizza was card board cheese. The atmosphere, well on this particular evening another patron got sick at the bar, and instead of excusing herself and going to the restroom, she just sat there and let puke run down her chest...bar tenders or management didn't tell her to leave, I told her to get up and leave and she wouldn't. Her boyfriend continued to enjoy his fried basket of whatever he was eating while the rest of us got a whiff of what her stomach didn't agree with. 

Will NOT be returning to this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with the locals here- the waitress, Tiffany, was fast, friendly, and everyone at the bar was laughing, having a great time. Fair prices, very clean, nice pool tables, dart machines, and shuffleboard. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This was our second time at Final Round. We love love dive bars and this one is our top 3 here in the Tempe area. Rebecca and Tarah were great bartenders and provided great service! The food was great our first time (which made us come back) and it was even better the second time. We will be returning and probably end up being regulars. Great pub food and drink specials and you HAVE to try Rebecca's Black Jack Honey shot if you're into whiskey!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the area!!! There are lots of places to grab a drink from Rural to Mill, but Final Round will always be my go to stop. Ro and her girls are some of the best in town, and pretty good lookin too!!! Love all the TVs and the wings!!"}
{"text":"Fun sports bar, nice group of locals and excellent bar staff. Good is very good, wings were great but if you go on wing might go early and order wisely."}
{"text":"Seriously - some of the nicest people own, work or go to this pub. The food is decent - especially their pizza and wings. I love their jalapeno cheese curds. One of the few establishments that still respects the tradition of Fish Fry Friday!  I appreciate their regular entertainment nights and food specials.  Everything is priced well, so what is not to love?"}
{"text":"My sis and I visited this spot and it was pretty decent.  The drink special on beer for happy hour is awesome.  The best that I can see from visiting several different dive bars.  The pool tables and darts are a plus for enjoyment.  It was a little loud with drunk customers, but OK, we all drinking, laughing and having a good time.  Plenty of outside seating.  The bartenders were nice, smiled and made sure we were taken care of.  I can't speak on the food because we didn't eat, but I can see myself visiting this spot again."}
{"text":"Came by for Thursday night football. I was so hungry. Ordered the board or platter. You can pick three items from their fried bar food menu. I got the chicken strips, onion rings and mushrooms. The \"chicken strips\" were pre-formed small chicken paddies like you'd get frozen from Fry's. The onion rings and mushrooms we're burnt offerings. Way over fried. My problem was I paid cash at the bar upon ordering since no waitress showed at the table after waiting too long. The bar tender never came to check on the satisfaction with meal. The waitress came by much later and I explained the problem. She said they'd give me some recompense. But she never came back. I stopped to talk to the bar tender on the way out.  She says \"Next time when you're served let us know and we'll make it right.\" There will be no next time."}
{"text":"We used to live right down the street from here and passed it a dozen times before we saw it.  That's on us.  We gave it a shot during a quiz (?) night and it was pretty cool.  The pitchers were cheap, and the atmosphere as mentioned elsewhere, was actually pretty fun.  The place is admittedly small but it's fun enough that you forget about that pretty quick.  

Well done, I must say."}
{"text":"Nice bar with good staff. Always have had a good time in the few times I have went in there. Good drinks and a few pool tables with some karaoke. Pizza is pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"The karaoke host sucks, the food ok, the drinks good. I came to sing, no order friends first don't you worry about the new people,you just go ahead and skip them. Not thinking I need to come back."}
{"text":"I ordered mozzarella sticks... the cheese had oozed out of most and was in a fried ball in the to-go container with what looks like mushrooms and onions stuck to it. Many cheese sticks had half cheese in them and one was completely empty.

I also ordered their buffalo chicken wrap, which is made with a VERY spicy 'home-made' sauce that taste like pure tobasco. The entire wrap in in-edible as it is oozing sauce from the wrap.

I'm thoroughly disappointed in the food I have received tonight. I understand this is a bar and I did not expect a 5 star meal, but I did expect edible bar food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 5 years and this is my home bar.  It has great prices and a lot of fun events including bar olympics, trivia, poker, and karaoke.  The staff are pretty awesome as well."}
{"text":"Always good service and great food. 


Everyone is nice. It's the local bar where everyone knows your name. 

Good place to hang out and converse."}
{"text":"This place is truly my fav place to have a drink and eat. Or just drink...or just eat. Dive bar slash sports bar. Patio rocks. Lots of TVs. Wings & Pizza are awesome.  Fyi: they batter there own mushrooms and zucchini..Luv them! Burgers Rockstar. Breakfast on the weekends. So much happening during the week and happy hour or lunch.  The bartenders and chefs are sweet and rock. Talk to the Regs they have stories to keep you entertained. Danny B BLUE SUEDE POOLS LLC"}
{"text":"A couple of days ago my roommate ordered take out. He ordered a bit too much wings from here. He couldn't finish them so he gave me 12 wings. They were grilled, and on the box just said \"hot\". Just hot buffalo I guess. But wow, those wings were delicious! And don't even get me started on the ranch. It was creamy, and tasty. I haven't been to many sports bars, but these wings have been by far the best I've ever had. So I'm excited to visit here one day and explore the menu."}
{"text":"In my \"new go to bar search\"
I walk in, turn around and walk back out. 
Looks awesome from the outside, inside not so much.
Just keep swimming just keep swimming just keep swimming.........."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Great atmosphere, good food, cheap prices and amazing bartenders, specially Tiffany she's the best!!!"}
{"text":"Great wings. Great beer prices. Great staff *when you get to know them, well... when they get to know you*. Nice location. More homely and inviting feel than the other locations at the intersection. They have darts, pool tables, and shuffle board. Karaoke and other game nights. Themed nights and specials almost daily. Worth a shot."}
{"text":"I found an incredible little place. Lynard Skynard playing in the bar area, game sound in the other side. Kathy runs the place and they have great breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been stopping into this place for the better part of a decade. I don't go as often as I used to but everything is even better now than it has ever been! The food is delicious, especially for    a bar. The drinks are reasonable and strong. There is always something going on, everything from karaoke to trivia to bar Olympics! There is also a sweet game room with pool and darts. Everywhere you look there are tvs with ALL the games playing.  I have known many couples who have met their significant others here, including myself. Bottom line, great place to go meet up with friends or meet some new ones if your current ones suck! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Divey cool lil bar.  $2.00 u call it with yelp check in is da bomb. One of the few places n Tempe that has a Sat happy hour! Wings r good... Hamburgers r thick.... Beer n pitchers, oh yeah!!"}
{"text":"A tiny establishment with an outdoor patio, they had the prompter on three tvs so you can spin around and work the crowd. There weren't a whole lot of people there so going with a big group, and forcing your shy friend to do Gin and Juice is a real possibility. 

The staff, karaoke dj and semi-regulars were fantastic. I got to do two songs within an hour (if curious-I practiced my Heart Crazy On You and Mary J Blige's Real Love)."}
{"text":"Cool local sports dive bar.  I didn't eat this time, but the food looked really good and I heard the pizza is a must try.   The owner was really cool too."}
{"text":"Best bar ever.  staff is awesome,  owner is amazing and the deep fried mushrooms and wings are incredible.  Fun karaoke, trivia and poker nights to boot.  Really,  this place is just great."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect small neighborhood bar. Always have something fun going on every time we go. Food is great too. Some of the best wings I've had"}
{"text":"I don't want to repeat what everyone else on here has been saying, re: cheap drinks, regular crowd, Cheers-type atmosphere, crappy-but-fun karaoke.  That stuff is all true, as far as it goes.  My guy and I live right down the street, and have been hanging out here pretty much every other weekend since July 2012.  As such, we've spent a decent amount of cash and have even introduced a few new folks to the bar.  

After today, however, I'm never going back.  We walked over, ready for some Sunday screwdrivers and some hang-out time with the regulars.  We even brought a bunch of chocolate to share with everyone while we sat on the patio and caught up. I was carded- totally fair, since this particular bartender had never seen me before- and then... told my license had a weird address, that I couldn't be served, and that I had to leave the premises.  Immediately.  WHAT?!  (For the record, I have an AZ license with an IL address.  I asked the DMV lady if that was okay when I went and got the darn thing, and she assured me it was fine).  

The icing on the cake?  The regulars we were going to hang out with didn't even speak up on my behalf!  I walked out of there feeling embarrassed and confused- and ready to point anyone who asks to the Woodshed, a similar bar kitty-corner to Final Round.  (The drinks are even a little cheaper).  What the hell, guys?  I know your regular clientele probably spends more money in a day than me and my boyfriend do in a month at your bar, but we were fairly loyal customers until this happened.  Way to lose business and piss off some locals."}
{"text":"Shitty service, poor wings. I will never waste my time here, there are so many better places to eat and drink. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"For a bar, this place is okay.  Gosh I haven't been here for a couple decades.  Seriously. 
I was lured in by the check in offer and the opportunity to try something different in the area.
So I dragged my son here for a late lunch.  A couple Margs for me, soda for him, and we split sliders, a dozen wings, and some loaded skins.  Pretty good stuff ftmp.  My first Marg was better than the second but the appetizers were alright.
Checking my bill I did have a question about one item that pertained to my $2.00 check in offer.  Seems I got charged a buck more = 1 Margarita Well Call.  I was like really?!
Sigh.
Some days I just get to the point it just doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Home away from home...  Cool Tarbenders and awesome food. Pizza...Bomb, wings...Bomb, female Tarbenders...BOMB!  Like bars back home."}
{"text":"They'll bring you your food if you remind them a couple times. Football Sunday's are good here but service falls off when they get too busy."}
{"text":"Great place for fun and drinks - GREAT place for football watching and if you're an AZ Card fan or Dallas Cowboy fan you have a home in Tempe!

Sunday funday food menu - smoked gouda bites... 'nuff said!!!  

Locally owned and managed - which is awesome to support real people and not some nameless corporation.  LOCAL FIRST!

Love coming to Final!!!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for the perfect place to get the best wings. I've seen this place for years but never ate there. Tonight I decided to try it after reading reviews on Yelp. I ordered a dozen honey hot and 6 Cajun, both extra crispy. Let's start with the honey hot. First, I only got 11 wings. Second, honey hot should be sweet and spicy. These were neither. Maybe they got the order entered incorrectly?  Not sure. They were also not extra crispy. They were average at best. The Cajun were also not extra crispy, but they tasted pretty good, hence the 2 stars instead of 1. On the positive the 2 beautiful ladies at the bar were friendly and attentive and the wings were priced well compared to other places.  I'm not sure what happened but as it stands I did not have the same experience as most of the reviewers on Yelp. I'm left feeling disappointed."}
{"text":"I come here every Sunday after 10pm for industry night. They have $2 U-Call-it's, and it includes almost every drink. Their fried food is amazing. You can't go to this place without trying the jalapeño cheese curds, the mini corn dogs, and onion rings.

Drinks are a little pricy when it's not Sunday, but I don't mind."}
{"text":"It's a fun environment and very nice staff but the food is hit or miss. I love the mini corn dogs but when we ordered the burger medium rare it came out well over well done. Depends off the chef"}
{"text":"Truly a dive bar, prices were awesome, lots of people for a Thursday night. Only complaint was majority of the people were edging on sloppy drunk and it was karaoke night so...my poor ears. Overall not a bad experience though!"}
{"text":"Just called to see what food they still cooked late night. They guy was such a dick on the phone I won't ever be going there."}
{"text":"Okay here we go, this bar is very special to me. This is a small dive located in a strip mall that i never noticed til 2008 even though i lived 2 blocks away most of my life. Final round became like Cheers to me for awhile, always familiar faces and friendly people(sometimes too friendly ;). The food here is really great (homemade pizza dough and yummy burgers) and the drinks are perfect and super cheap($5 stoli redbull,what?). There is usually stuff going on like karaoke on saturdays, poker and 35 cent wings on mondays, and they have special events occasionally. Went there last year for St Patty's day and there was cheap homemade corned beef and cabbage with a live band and they extended into the parking lot for it. This bar is smallll and not the nicest decor(star off for lack of room and decor), but its comfy and all too easy to become a reg.  Bring a couple friends to have a nice divey time and sing/listen to some bad karaoke. I have probably never had more fun at a bar as I have at this one."}
{"text":"The Executive summary:

Food -- All appetizers on the menu were gross, even fries :( . The ranch you expect at a dive bar is replaced by sour bottled store crap, so that kills any fried food love. but the fried food was not worth the $... I didnt try pizza or burgers so I cant judge there. It is clear they are a bar and not restaurant -- but drunk people eat drunk food, and they have it.

Drinks -- cheap cheap. Bar service can be slow on any busy night and they dont often visit the tables so you stand at tthe bar behind the regulars trying to squeeze in.
Trivia Tuesdays are great. I love trivia and the menu is happy hour prices (tho, to repeat myself I will not order any food again.

Atmosphere -- Low key, low expectation neighborhood bar. I like that. Theres a big pool room with darts and shuffleboard. There is a patio out front for smoking where you can actually have a seat at a table and smoke -- essential to a bar, for god sake. This fact in and of itself is worth a star.

Decor -- Dark and old.

So... Go there to drink, smoke  and play trivia -- not to eat."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. Tucked behind a gas station in a business park.Stopped in with a couple of out of town friends who wanted a beer and a burger and someplace clean.
Stopped in on a Tuesday night, place was pretty busy but didn't feel crowded. 
As soon as we stepped in we were greeted enthusiastically by the staff and started feeling comfortable right away. Pretty fair mix of clientele but also generous amount of women so that tells you they feel safe and secure and are happy with cleanliness or they wouldn't bother.
Big selection of sports across many different sized screens, you could see any game anywhere in bar or at the seating area booths and high tops.
Our server Tiffany came over right away and took our drink order and returned quickly. She told us it was $1 taco Tuesday (big and worth it) and happy hour. If we wanted to play trivia we could enjoy happy hour during trivia. She recommended the grilled wings which also were very good and I recommend.
We stayed a few rounds of trivia and enjoyed the company,drinks and food.
If ever in the area I would return and do recommend if someone in the area or visitor is looking for quick and pretty good priced food and service."}
{"text":"Not quite small enough to be a hole-in-the-wall, this bar is packed with regulars.  It is a pretty chill place considering the number of people that come to it on Friday nights especially.  People there are pretty friendly and they are always hosting some kind of event (usually kareoke most nights).  I would say that if you were looking for someplace to go that isn't crazy like the rest of Mill Ave.  then head here!"}
{"text":"I love this little neighborhood bar.   Yeah, they serve drinks, yeah they have pool, yeah, yeah, yeah.    

I love this place because I declare that they have THE BEST FISH AND CHIPS IN TOWN.

Now, I know it is a bold statement, but I stand by it.   I haven't eaten everywhere, but I get around. 

Try them, you will like them."}
{"text":"Ok, our second experience at Final Round was not nearly as fun as our first time there. We went back last Saturday night with some friends from out of town and were disappointed to find that it was not as much as of a hidden gem as we thought it to be. As I said before, I can really appreciate a good ole' dive bar with karaoke, cheap drinks, and interesting people. That being said, the second time we went, even though the drinks were still cheap and the crowd was still diverse, the wait to sing was really long (with these two very, very loud and grating regulars getting turns what felt like three times as frequently as everyone else), the sound system was turned up way too loud so you couldn't have a conversation, and the bar service was really slow for how many people were there. We all left with our ears practically bleeding and only having gotten one chance to sing in two hours or so. 

Maybe it just wasn't a good place to take a big group. Or maybe Saturday nights are a lot crazier than Friday nights. Either way, I'm going to have to retract my original 5-star rating and give this place a 3. I'm sure we'll still go back at some point when we're in the mood for karaoke on a Friday night, but if we could go to Kobalt instead and have 1) more chances to sing; 2) better-quality and just-as-cheap drinks; 3) friendly, fast service; and 4) regulars who sing well and don't act like they own the place, why wouldn't we?"}
{"text":"This place wasn't too bad.

A friend and I were in the area for an event at Kiwanis and afterward wanted to find a place to chill, grab a beer and something to eat.  After checking out yelp, we decided to try this place out based on the reviews.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in as it is at the end of an office complex.  When we entered I definitely got a divey sports bar feel, so I was curious to know what the food was like.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the cowboy burger with tots and my friend had a regular  burger.  It was well prepared and tasty.  The staff was friendly also.

The weird part of the experience was the elderly drunk man who put on some music on the jukebox and then started dancing by himself by the front door.  Weird, but stuff happens.

I wouldn't have a problem coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here! It's laid back and relaxed!! This is such a fun neighborhood bar and the drinks are great!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. The first time I came here was almost two years ago, and I've been trying to figure out where it was. We found it again tonight ant I couldn't be more happy. It looks like a biker bar that might make some people feel uncomfortable but don't judge it by its cover. The people are fun friendly and incredibly nice. I love this bar and there's karaoke on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Rude owner would never go back again went with a great friend and was in a tournament slash bean bag game. And one they tried to kick him out saying he was too drunk"}
{"text":"Okay, first of all, writing a review for a bar is a big deal for me.  I don't really care for the bar scene at all and rarely go to them.  It was 11 p.m. and I was bored.  A coworker told me about this place and how they have karaoke.  I do NOT sing in front of people, but I thought it might be fun to just go, have a beer and watch other people sing.  I'm glad I went.  It wasn't overly crowded, which is perfect for me, and the staff was very friendly.  I noticed that a lot of the people here all know each other, so there are a lot of regulars.  I didn't witness anyone being overly intoxicated or disrespectful.  Oddly enough, I felt very comfortable here and would not hesitate to go back again.

I was hungry, so I ordered some deep fried mushrooms and mini corn dogs.  The mini corn dogs were good, but the deep fried mushrooms were amazing!  These aren't what you get out of a package.  Large beer battered mushrooms!  Awesome!  I saw someone eating a pizza that looked delicious as well.  I may try that next time.  (There will be a next time.)

The karaoke was very entertaining.  As can be expected, there were people who definitely can't sing and a few people who are pretty good.  There's no judgment.  It is what it is and everyone was having fun.  The host for the karaoke, Greg, was fantastic.  It was obvious that he knew many of the people there and is an overall good dude.

I left Final Round feeling as though I witnessed what it's like to be in a bar where everyone knows your name, ala Cheers.  If you like a dive bar with good food, friendly staff and patrons that add character to the experience, this place is for you."}
{"text":"This place got me shitfaaaaacccceeeedddd and I am 57 years old!

Love their karaoke too."}
{"text":"A great place to relax for a while and meet new people.  The staff is really friendly, and it's a pretty eclectic crowd, with a mix of ages and backgrounds.  The prices are very reasonable.  The only caveat is the food can come out a little too greasy every once in a while.  They have always been good about remaking an order if I don't like it.  Final Round is a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Good food. And they have the Big Ten Network.  Asked them to change one of the tv's to watch the Iowa game. They said no problem. Happy hour til 7 pm. Nice."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest spots to karaoke at in town. Or at least in my opinion. Its a small bar, has both indoor & outdoor seating, they have some of the cleanest bathrooms I've seen. Their food is really good too. I always get the fried chicken wings or their potato skins, because when I have a drink I have to have food to go with it LOL I recommend this place if you're looking for a fun place to karaoke at. Their prices are also super decent! I had 4 margaritas & 2 michelob's & an order of potato skins & fries & everything came out to $47.20!! Great prices."}
