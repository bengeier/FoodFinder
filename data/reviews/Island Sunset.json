{"text":"Been coming to this establishment  for awhile best jerk chicken, also the price on Tuesdays is more than reasonable, $3.50  recently on the menu  Jeck chicken puteen best I every tasted"}
{"text":"2.5
so the food is great especially the 3.50 jerk chicken special. at the end of the day you cant complain about that kind of pricepoint. however the rating is based on the customer service.  the man is not acknowledging of your presence as a customer, seems to have an attitude and seems miserable."}
{"text":"Best Tuesday jerk chicken special. Only $3.50 and it's quite filling. Their daily $5 jerk chicken is still awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm always down for some Carribean food, so there is nothing wrong with a $5 Jerk meal! This Jerk joint has got to be the best steal of all restaurants I've been to. Not only is the Jerk meal super filling, but it's ridiculously delicious. The meal came with two good sized pieces of chicken, perfect rice and peas, and an easy side of coleslaw. The chicken wasn't dry at all rather it was super moist and spice was there, but not too overwhelming. Tip, skip the Mr.Jerk across the street, you'll never go back after trying this place. 

\"Scarborough's Best Kept Secret\" Definitely."}
{"text":"all the other ratings are fake. their food is garbage. staight up nasty food. I'm surprised they still running the business. soooo bad"}
