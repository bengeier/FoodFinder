{"text":"Sorry Yelpers, but I disagree with the previous reviews.
Maybe they've changed ownership?  But they are not Japanese-operated, the chef and all the waitstaff are Korean.  It looked like a small family run business though.

Also, not particularly authentic.

However if you live in the area, and are craving sushi and don't want to go far, and willing to pay for it, this is could be your place.

Foodwise - overall fairly bland tasting fish, portions small.  But freshness was decent.  Temperature of the fish was just right.

Agedeshi tofu - could taste the flavor of the tofu (nice and fresh) but drizzled with a sweet sauce (rather unusual for agedeshi); dipping sauce on the side (not very flavorful), and without bonito.

Sunomono seafood salad - nice assortment of different types of kelp.  But seafood consisted of one piece of fake crab (pollock), one small shrimp, and four quarter-sized 2mm thin tako (octopus).  Yikes.

Wild salmon sashimi - looked and tasted sub-par.  My SO and I rock-paper-scissored to see who HAD to take the last piece!  White tuna and regular tuna nigiri slightly more flavor.  Black Dragon roll was better - shrimp tempura inside a roll, covered with avocado (perfectly ripened) and few slices of unagi (again needed more flavor). 

Service is attentive.  Restaurant is small and quaint.  Busy with the neighborhood crowd, mostly youngish families and takeout.

$50 plus tax.  No alcohol.  Neither of us were full, and we are both small eaters.... paying for convenience as we were in the neighborhood, I guess.

Sorry but I don't think we will go back.  Didn't seem like just a bad night, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I absolutely adored this place! 

We didn't order anything too spectacular, but the both the service and the food were excellent.

I came with a friend, and we both ate to our hearts' content. 

We ordered...

Chicken Gyozas - these were pretty good, similar to other gyozas that I've had. They were deepfried and came out nice and hot.

Nori Chazuke - I really don't know how other 'chazukes' are really supposed to taste, but I really liked this one. It was rather vinegar-y, but complemented the tea well.

Tuna maki - a relatively simple order, but the fish was fresh and was quite amazing.

Vegetable tempura maki - the combination of squash, asparagus and tempura yam was awesome. At a lot of other sushi places that I've been to in Toronto, they have the tendency to put avocados in everything. Not that I don't like avocados, but the asparagus was refreshing - loved the texture of the roll! Plus the tempura was still really warm! The sauce on it was yummy too. Suffice to say, I loved this roll!

Mochi ice-cream - we were pretty full, but couldn't help but order to order this. It was delicious! Again, nothing too spectacular, but it was still a great way to end the evening.

--------

The selection wasn't too huge here (compared to somewhere like New Generation down on Bloor), but definitely sufficient. There was enough for us to choose from, and lots of things on the menu I want to go back and try! =)

{"text":"Excellent place. Edamame was great. Had the Osaka combo and Dynamite Roll. All very good. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere. Great local place for sushi."}
{"text":"Super homely environment, excellent service and very good sushi make this small restaurant a great place for sushi on cold wintry nights. Very decently priced as well.
Love that they have a bar style corner if you come alone or like see the cooks prepare the food."}
{"text":"What a find on St. Clair W.!! Walk past The Rushton and the new fish place, and know that you are passing the mediocre for greatness!

The place is small with standard sushi-bar decor. Very, very clean and smells wonderful. I sat at the bar and was looked after by the owner who has been in this location for almost 10 years. I was on my own so had one of the combo plates which was all of the good stuff, and not just salmon. I will return with 2 or 3 friends for a wider journey through the menu, but this is the real, deal folks."}
{"text":"Was feeling for sushi and needed to get out of the house.  Looked on Yelp for mid town sushi spots with good reviews and this came up.  The interior is very Small and not much to look at, however the food was great.  Everything was quickly prepared and brought to us but it was also very fresh.  My friend and I both had the veggie bento boxes that comes with miso soup and salad.  It was delicious and so much food!  I was very full but determined to enjoy every last bite.  The chopsticks came in their own little box which was so cute!  The service was great and the staff were very friendly.  I would recommend and return."}
{"text":"AMAZING neighbourhood sushi joint. Super fresh fish, great service, and delish rolls. This is a once-a-week place for us. Highly recommend it! Amazing value."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it's never failed. Always tasty, fresh ingredients, friendly service. Combo platters are a great choice. Caterpillar roll is excellent. It's not a flashy place. Takeout available."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Their Japanese dishes and grill is wonderful and is better than their sushi. I usually come here for that as opposed to the sushi which I find better at their sister restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. Where to begin. 

Came into restaurant 35 minutes before close, after calling ahead to ensure they were open given the weather. 

Server was extremely rude, and rushed us to make our choices for meals before even bringing water or taking a drink order. That's okay though, because he never brought the drinks we did order. 

Another customer came in to order take out 15 minutes before closing time, and the same server told them \"we're closed\". This was very uncomfortable and awkward as we were eating our dinner right there.

Loved the food on previous visits but to top it all off, but my GF and I both got sick from the food.  

I will never go back, which is sad because they were previously my first choice for sushi on SCW. I guess places change."}
{"text":"Slow service even though there are only 7 tables. The sushi is below average, I ordered the sushi combo \"Osaka\" and it was tasteless. And end up paying 20. Overpriced and poor quality. Don't recommend"}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place in the neighborhood, we've been coming here for over five years. Consistent good quality and great service.  I highly recommend the Nama Special roll, and the Boston roll."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time(end of feb) based on yelp reviews. Was a bit worried since there was only 1 server who kept on apologizing to everyone. It was worth the wait.  Had the shrimp tempura. Nice light batter. Salmon and hamachi sushi was very fresh. Salmon skin Maki was excellent. Unagi sushi was unfortunately off. What raised the bar was their lobster roll. If you come here and don't order it you are missing the best thing that is NOT on the menu. We only found out when we asked for a recommendation on a house roll. I would have given it 5 stars if it were not for the Unagi. Be prepared to wait however it is well worth it.

Note: Since the kitchen is in the open and the deep fryer is going non-stop - your clothes will smell ... don't wear your best duds.

Update: I have been here again since this review (I forgot to post it from my phone the first time). Less crowded this time. Good service - excellent food again.  Everything was fresh."}
{"text":"Very friendly and efficient service, happily provided recommendations. Went in for dinner on a Friday night. Their house-made salad dressing on the green salad is really good. Also had the tuna and green onion maki and the volcano roll. Delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy Japanese restaurant. 
The fish are very fresh and tasty, the rolls and sushi are good portion and affordable price! 
The server was very attentive and willing to accommodate our special request."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 because nothing is perfect. 
This place rules. Best sushi on St. Clair West. Fresh fish! You can tell because it's not ice cold when you chow down. I am currently enjoying the Osaka set and it's worth ever penny. Even the California rolls are good - not stingy with the salmon roe which is a nice change of pace. 
Honestly, this place is great. If you're craving sushi without wanting to spurge NAMA is your best bet."}
{"text":"Excellent Service and delicious sushi!!! We had the Vegetable Bento Box, the best I've had in a while Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi - can't ask for better on St Clair West. The tuna sashimi is so very fresh and the portions are generous. The inari is delicious. The only thing I don't like is that your clothes and hair smell like the deep-fryer when you leave - wish they had a better fan! I prefer to take out for that reason."}
{"text":"I ordered using Just Eat. I was lazy and they only charge 0.99 for delivery on minimum $20 order - which i was able to do by ordering two hand rolls (spicy scallop and spicy tuna) and a maki (Cali roll that had bbq eel on top). There are closer sushi places to me that I could walk to (Osaka) for a quick fix, but I'd prefer this one."}
{"text":"Nama Sushi is a cozy little sushi joint on the St. Clair W. strip.  When we first walked in, the first thing to hit us was a pleasing smell of tempura and when we looked at the kitchen, we realized why.  Nama's entire kitchen is a little open space at the back of the restaurant by the sushi bar, so all the food is prepared in front of you (if you feel like watching).

Our waiter was having a rough night.  He was actually one of the chefs who had to fill in for a sick waitress, but he did a bang up job.  He explained his dilemma to us, brought us edamame on the house and, while our food came out a little slowly, was still attentive enough to refill our water.  He also got to brag about the fact that he made our salad (Great avocado salad with lettuce, carrot, cucumber, strings of beet and purple cabbage and tangy vinegar dressing - highly recommended).  How often do servers get to do that?

We ordered an entirely veggie dinner and it was fresh and delicious with good variety.  We really liked the tofu rolls (rolled up Inari wrappers with cucumber) and veggie dragon roll that had still-warm yam tempura topped with ample avocado.  Lots of vegetarian choices here and a little more variety than usual.

Atmosphere is very family friendly.  Next to us was a set of parents explaining to their eager kids why fish is okay to eat raw but chicken isn't.  Nice.

We'll be back to see what it's like when their waitstaff is around.

Vegetarian score: 7.5/10"}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi melts in your mouth, tempura is perfectly battered and everything is fresh. The family that runs it is very kind and caring."}
{"text":"HOW HAVE I NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE?

I've lived about a 10 minute walk from this restaurant for at least 2 years, walked by countless times, but never thought to go in. I bemoan these wasted years.  

Atmosphere: good
Service: great
Food: SWEET SASSY MOLASSY! 

Really, the restaurant is quite nondescript but the sushi really sings. The fish is amazing quality.. just fantastic texture and flavour, and the rice was perfect. This place must be popular because several people came in for takeout (10% off over $20) while we were eating. 

Also, as we left, one of the servers came by and asked us how everything went, then wished us a nice night. I love it when someone goes the extra mile. 

I'll definitely be back. Hell, I'll probably end up putting their kids through college."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food, great atmosphere. Not very cheap, but worth every penny.  Not as popular as it should be really. Best sushi in town."}
{"text":"Move over Japango, Nama sushi has stolen the key to my sushi heart.

Nama and I have known each other for awhile, but I didn't truly come to appreciate their skill and exceptional quality until I dined in a couple months ago. They've held their location for many years now, and it's no surprise, as they have a steady flow of regulars who've fell for the humble service and quality of fish.

It's hard to find sushi restaurants where the owner and sushi chef are actually Japanese. You'll know the difference immediately when you see the cuts of fish and the taste in quality. Nama has a great selection of fish and rolls, but not too much to overwhelm you. 

I really only have to say one thing: The sake (salmon sashimi) -  so buttery and fresh that when you lightly press your chopstick in the middle, it divides. No more sawing or excessive chewing, just let it melt.
The sushi chef knows what he's doing. He picks the freshest fish, rolls tight stuffed rolls and has the most magical salad dressing. 

I've been hesitant to spread the word based on the fact I want it to remain a hidden gem but that wouldn't be right. You need to get in to try their salmon sashimi. Just close your eyes and let it melt."}
{"text":"I don't know, I read what people say, I understand they come here for 5 years, but I don't get why. After sushi on Bloor, this place seems overpriced, they don't deliver, they don't have a website where you can pick what you want and order. The sushi are fine, but again, I was not raving about them. I have been here twice 

The owners are nice, hardworking people. Very pleasant."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood sushi joint! 

Got the Kyoto, and subbed out the California roll for spicy salmon roll which was outstanding. 
Also want to highlight how  fresh and delicious the salmon nigiri was, will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Perfect 10! Very thorough, friendly service- our server Ryan was so knowledgeable and tentative, food was brought in a very timely manner- hardly any wait time at all! And the sushi itself was to die for, so fresh and warm and delicious, I couldn't get enough of it! will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this place for the last 5 years, and it's hands-down my favourite (affordable) sushi place in the city. I used to visit the Annex to get my sushi fix, but no more. The quality and care is MILES above the typical cheap sushi place: proper sushi rice, larger portions of fish (especially in their maki rolls) and very fresh quality. Also, the head sushi chef is terribly nice and works very hard. 

The tempura is delicious: light and flaky, and not overly heavy with grease. My boyfriend - who normally dislikes miso soup - regularly slurps it up here, as I think it's vegetable-based (other places use a fish broth, which doesn't agree with him.)

Their spicy tuna or salmon maki is a MUST TRY. I've never tasted anything like this elsewhere: the fish is finely minced and mixed with the sauce - it literally feels like it melts in your mouth. (I'm salivating just typing this out!)

The reason I'm not giving this a perfect rating: as of late, the ingredients they use have been inconsistent. For example, their basic salad used to be filled with a yummy mix of healthy greens; now it's a mix of a few greens and bland iceberg lettuce.

Also, I usually order the Tokyo Sushi Combo, which never included the \"cheap fillers\" like shrimp, clam, crab or egg. All twelve pieces were ALWAYS excellent types of fish. On my last visit for (the very first time) I was given crab and shrimp - although still good, but was disappointing nonetheless.

And as a dessert, they usually offered complimentary slices of orange - this didn't happen the last visit. I don't know if it was because they ran out, or due to an absentminded waitress. 

I've noticed they've also started to offer more menu items like grilled chicken and bento boxes. I thought it was pretty remarkable of them to initially offer only the sushi basics, to focus on the quality of food, but I suppose they have to keep afloat and cater to demand (I once watched a mother with kids screech at the waitress: \"You DON'T DO BENTO??\") The new additions are very tasty, but I'm ambivalent if it means that the sushi suffers, which I'm really hoping won't be the case."}
{"text":"I thought this place was a solid neighbourhood sushi joint on the St. Clair W drag.  

I arrived for a late dinner, at almost 8pm, so needless to say place was pretty quiet.  Not sure how it is during a regular dinner hour.  I don't think they're open for lunch.

Restaurant itself is fairly small, only about 7 tables.  Décor-wise, it is non-pretentious, and what you'd expect for a sushi restaurant, nothing fancy.  Service matches the atmosphere.  I felt as though food did take a bit longer to roll out, but I wasn't in a rush...but boy, did I come hungry!

Fish was fresh and obviously steps above AYCE-quality.  Good fish:rice ratio.  No complaints at all about the food or service.

I don't think Nama has much competition in the immediate area, but it's still a great option if you're in this area and in the mood for sushi (for dinner)!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, forgot that the last time me and my husband had sushi this good...was the last time we were here. Friendly service as always."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my stop here during my visit to Toronto and must say this was the favourite restaurant that I stopped by during my visit.

I got the vegetable box which came with miso soup, salad, 2 different kinds of sushi, vegetable tempura, and some vegetable rolls and some hot sake

I was also most impressed by the way they presented the chopsticks in individual boxes.

The owner of the restaurant seemed like a friendly guy too. He stopped by our table and spoke to us for sometime (it was a little slow for business). I do wish that he had given us some more space though as my friend and I were catching up after not meeting for a long time."}
{"text":"I don't know if I would go as far as Jackie and place Nama over Japango but I will say that it is a great sushi restaurant with fantastic quality seafood and really great presentation. I always love finding a proper sushi restaurant with real japanese trained sushi chefs and this place is just that. They may not be the quickest in town but there is a reason for that, they focus on presenting a perfect dish every time.

Great place and worth a try"}
{"text":"Do not order takeout from this place. They botched my order then proceeded to blame it on me. I ordered the tempura veggie roll with a substitution of avocado instead of squash. I have done this before at their suggestion, with no extra charge added. My order came without the proper substitution, so I called to rectify the situation. The employee told me that the avocado was already in the roll so he substituted it for squash. If you read the menu you would know that this is a blatant lie. Then he corrected himself by telling me that it would actually cost 50 cents extra, so he wouldn't substitute it. He continued to change his story, hoping to tire me out. Long story short, they did not compensate me for their error or send me the correct order. Needless to say, I will not be eating here again. The dishonesty and lack of respect is truly appalling."}
{"text":"This is the \"Cheers\" of Sushi. Everyone knows our name and our order! We come here almost weekly (and pick up when we are lazy). Always great food and is a great family friendly environment. Highly recommend for a low key night out with friends and family."}
