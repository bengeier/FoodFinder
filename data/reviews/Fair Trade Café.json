{"text":"Fair Trade is great for coffee. The sole purpose of my visit today was for coffee, but the menu looked too enticing to pass up. Unfortunately, only the typography of the menu is delectable because the food was terrible. My tuna melt had such little flavor, I thought about putting salt on it. My roommate loved her tea and desserts, but paid for a full dish of tempeh scramble and got less than a side dish. Good thing, though, because it didn't taste well either. So come to Fair Trade for the coffee, raspberry hibiscus tea (ask for it iced!) and their desserts, not entrées."}
{"text":"When I went to ASU, Fair Trade Café at the Civic Space Park was my go-to coffeehouse for caffeine. I went there over the campus Starbucks because it was an indie coffeehouse, had decent hours, and had wonderful coffee and coffee cakes. I'd always lobby to have after-class meetings and study sessions at Fair Trade.

Now that I'm not at ASU, I don't get to Fair Trade Café at the Civic Space Park a lot anymore. It's a shame, really, because the place is very good and merits a visit from you. When the weather is divine outside, you can sit in the concourse patio, look up, and admire the Janet Echelman public art piece \"Her Secret is Patience.\" As summer starts up or winds down, the patio area is refreshingly cool.

A quick note about wi-fi: You'll have to connect to ASU's public wi-fi network. It's actually pretty quick and reliable (for a University wi-fi network!) and you can access ASU's wide treasure trove of online research databases.

Go to Fair Trade and enjoy a nice cup of coffee (or tea). I highly commend it to you."}
{"text":"I give two stars because I'll admit the coffee is pretty good...
But pretty much everything else is consistently awful. Due to it's convenience I've been to this location four times and I'm 100% done. Each time was bad.
The barista's are consistently rude, unfriendly, and unhelpful. The music is extremely loud and makes you feel as if you're going clubbing rather than sitting in a coffee shop. 
Everything about this place is also extremely overpriced, and it's not even good.

I ordered the veggie panini with a salad on the side. She even asked me again to make sure I wanted the salad, I confirmed, and the panini still came out with chips and not a salad. Additionally, the herb bread it was supposed to come on was the most bland thing I have ever tasted. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Really want to support a place like this because its politics are an important site of departure from the norm, i.e. Starbucks. The people are friendly enough and the space is welcoming. However, the food is scant and awful. Second and last time eating there today. Skimpy and overly dry tuna sandwich, so dry I could hardly eat it and not very much to it. Then the bread of the sandwich was stale. I wish they could put their politics into their food quality rather than passing off a $7 sandwich this way. It's too bad because there are not a lot of alternatives that would even get close to healthy and good around here. The drinks are about as lackluster in my experience. Please tend to your quality as much as you do to your rhetoric."}
{"text":"I love this place! The employees are always nice to me and the food is so amazing. I wish more places served fair trade and organic ingredients. The menu is full of delicious items. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing.  Perfect place to to either meet up with a friend or enjoy a meal on your own."}
{"text":"The location is basically the basement of the A.E. English building in City Space Park. As a basement, this cafe really neefs to warm up its decor. It's rather stark inside. The latte I had was sizable and tasty, and the server was upbeat and friendly, although the wait was several minutes as he was the only person working in the cafe when I was there."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer at Fair Trade Cafe since they opened. The place has changed a lot over time - their menu is now fully vegetarian, they offer more teas, ice cream has come and gone and they've made massive improvements to the infrastructure inside. The current decor is beautiful and the place feels comfy cozy inside. I immediately want to curl up with a book or a laptop and spend time snuggling up to work whenever I walk in.

These positives aside, Fair Trade has consistently presented some unfavorable traits and is usually my last choice for coffee or a meal. It's often freezing cold inside the space - I know they can't help this, but it's a fact - and that makes it difficult to stay. The service is always very slow. I don't usually mind when I pop over for a cup of Grey Dutchess (my current favorite thing over there, it's the only reason I go anymore), but waiting about 15 minutes for a cup of coffee is a commitment.

If you order food, expect to wait even longer and the menu selections are often hit or miss. Their veggie quesadilla is quite delicious and their smoothies are tasty. Today however, I tried their Thai Summer Rolls which were not good. The tofu inside the wraps is soaked in soy sauce to give it flavor, but it leaves the tofu extremely salty. The peanut dipping sauce seemed like it was nothing more than a tablespoon of organic peanut butter - it's definitely too thick to be considered a \"dip\" or \"sauce\" and the flavor of the peanut butter clashed with the salty tofu instead of bringing balance to the dish. The rolls are served with a side salad which was made entirely of healthy dark green leafy vegetables which were delicious, but the salad dressing was nothing more than olive oil and salt.

Fair Trade is a great place to go if you're not in a hurry, don't mind waiting for food and can find the gems among their menu (seriously, try the veggie quesadilla). But you can probably do better."}
{"text":"The upside - the newly beating heart of downtown Phoenix has an independent coffee shop. 

The downside - you feel like you're walking through a hospital hallway. Fluorescent tube lighting, much?

I went to Fair Trade last night after their stalled initial opening attempt a few weeks ago where their outside cart's espresso machine had broken down and I could only get iced tea. No worries on that, though. It happens. 

Service was nice, coffee was decent (although not remarkable), and similar pastries as the original location. However, I don't think I'd want to linger inside. Seemed way too antiseptic for a coffeehouse, especially one touting fair trade beans and organic foodstuff. One long wooden table for group study - otherwise a couple steel patio tables adorn alongside the windowed walls. Kind of disappointed, but hopefully it's just a work in progress and they'll be adding more in there. 

I like the outdoor patio, though. Nice lit up waterwalls falling into decorative blue rocks, and if you're facing west, you can look up at that giant patient jellyfish (or whatever you want to call it) fluttering in the wind. Nice place to hang, although heading upstairs into Civic Space Park itself is probably nicer.

This location of Fair Trade is also open till 10pm every day - which I'm sure will be greatly appreciated by the ASU crowd (although realistically, students need a coffeehouse open much later). 

Decent start, but here's to hoping they improve. 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"I go to ASU so this place is conveniently located and I like to support local businesses, however, I have received the worst service in my life here on multiple occasions. They should close their doors. Even the simplest food item, like a grilled cheese sandwich or hummus and pita chips takes up to 45 minutes. The food is also incredibly inconsistent. 

My favorite thing they make is the burrito bowl but it is never the same. On the menu it says with aioli and pico de gallo but many times they will make it without either and they don't tell me they are out of ingredients when I order it or when I pick it up or offer to replace the missing ingredients with something else.

One time I got the burrito bowl and they used old rice they had dried out into little rocks. When I politely told the waitress, she apologized and gave me a gift card for a small coffee (the small coffee had a much lower value than the inedible burrito bowl). 

In summary, in one out of 5 to 10 visits, the food is really good. The service is always horrible and it is not worth the waste of time or irritation. 

To be fair, I think their food and coffee can be excellent when it is not missing ingredients and hasn't gone bad. That's why after so many disappointments, I still went to Fair Trade Cafe. 

I think the real problem is that the management does not have enough people on staff or enough oversight. Usually there is only one person working that has to both take orders and cook. Occasionally there are two people. For the service to improve, management needs to hire more people and also make sure that they check on the food to make sure they don't run out of ingredients of serve spoiled food. 

Until things change, don't waste your time and money. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"The second location of Fair Trade Cafe is a disappointing missed opportunity.  Descending the concrete steps into the patio of metal furniture promises a great bunker of caffeination.

Instead, this ASU-adjacent location feels like a university's student union coffee shop from the early 1990s.  I'm not anti concrete and glass and steel, but this space feels thrown together and unfit for an afternoon or evening of quiet conversation, study, or reading. Not cozy.

Plus (or should I say \"Minus\"?), there were no ceramics to serve their coffee and espresso in, which reminds me of the early days at Hob Nobs.  May I say out loud that you must not open your coffee shop unless you have ceramic mugs and demitasse cups on day one?  Try drinking an espresso or espresso macchiato from a 12 oz. paper cup.  It's on your face. Quickly."}
{"text":"I am so, SO happy that there are local coffee places popping up near my work. Until now, it's been the 'Bucks, wherever you turn.

I always get my coffee to go, so the interior isn't really a big concern of mine. The quality of the coffee is, and here, it's always top notch. The staff is very nice too.

Other perks -- they have punch card, and discounts for ASU and city employees. I'm neither. But on occasion, I answer the trivia question correctly, and get the discount that way.

I also like the fact that they make an effort to be more environmental. For instance, they use the recyclable cups, and spoons, rather than stirrers."}
{"text":"Fair Trade has an awesome new space at the basement of the old A.E. motor building in the middle of Civic Space Park, and it's going to be a great hangout spot for ASU students, light rail commuters and downtown residents alike. It's much airier and brighter than the flagship spot on Central and Roosevelt, and the grand opening event last night provided some great insight on how nice this spot can be. Tucked amongst the waterfalls and open-air patio seating, there are great views of the park, the Westward Ho and ASU's campus. 

Here's hoping they keep that mobile bar for use on the patio out front. It provided some cool liveliness to the spot that the other store sometimes needs."}
{"text":"I am an ASU student, full-time employee, and espresso and pastry connoisseur (of sorts). In fact, I exercise solely to be able to enjoy the richer foods in life. On Wednesdays, I take the light rail to the ASU downtown campus where I have my early morning Ochem class which I would liken to water-boarding (although I have not had the pleasure, but one can imagine). However, every Wednesday, after being battered and beaten by chemistry nomenclature, I come to Fair Trade Cafe which, I'm not exaggerating, is the highlight of my week. One might argue that a bologna sandwich in restroom stall might by pleasant after organic chemistry, but that is not why I love coming to this place. First off, the espresso is always on point; not to weak, not too strong, not too hot, not too cold...perfect. Secondly, and most importantly, they make everything here from scratch, and it is delicious. I hope my mom doesn't read this, but they have the best banana bread I have ever had and they give my grandmother a run for her money in the way of lemon bars. There are 3 things that are difficult to find in this world: a trustworthy dentist, an honest mechanic, and a good lemon bar. If you should be so lucky to find any one of these, hang on to them. The atmosphere is bar none. It is smack dab in the middle of the beautiful ASU downtown campus park. They have outdoor seating with flowing water walls, spacious indoor seating with plenty of table room for laptops, notebooks, textbooks, chemistry model kits (for you super dorks out there), and anything else you could put on a table. It might be frowned upon, but you could potentially change a baby or two if you felt so inclined. They always have great music played over a quality sound system indoors and out. Oh, and of course, free Wi-Fi with no gimmicks or sign-on page, which is what I am logged onto at this very moment. I can't say enough good things about this place and I hope and pray that a commercial coffee shop does not come anywhere near this gem. I challenge anyone to find and read the ingredients in the pastries made at Starbux or any other commercial bakery. You just might need to take organic chemistry to be able to read the list...seriously. Today I had the stuffed croissant. It is a homemade croissant, stuffed with black forrest ham, egg, and cheese. It was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had. The key was the fresh, baked-from-scratch croissant. Couple that with a perfect double espresso...that's a good day right there. I could get punched in the face the moment I get back on the light rail, and I will be unshaken after a treat like that. If you like great atmosphere, fresh homemade food, good music, good people and a business with a face, come to Fair Trade Cafe, you will not be disappointed. The owner, Stephanie just might be there to great you with a smile...find that at S-bux. For the record, I am not bashing Starbucks, I enjoy a one-pump white mocha latte from time to time, they make a good cup of joe, however, I am sharing my experience at an awesome local joint with great product and wonderful services. Check it out, bring a camera and get some beautiful city shots from the park. Peace and be easy my neezies."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times now and I still give it a 2 overall. 

Every time I have been in this place it has been FREEZING COLD. Within ten minutes Im shivering or leaving. And the beverages are just alright. I've had better tea and coffee. I do appreciate their all vegetarian menu, and the banana bread and treats, but that isn't enough to bring me back. The service is lacking, big time. The people who work there always seem too engaged in what their doing to chat it up with you or make you feel welcome. 
Even on my most recent experience: After waiting for someone to come to the front, I ordered a small hot tea. No talk, no smile, from the barista girl. She made my tea and set it on the bar almost spilling over. I looked around for milk but they never have any kind of creamer on the bar - you have to ask for it. So I asked her if she could pour some out so I could put cream in it. She gave me this look like I was the biggest pain in the ass ever, for asking for this. I even apologized, because she looked so irritated. 

I would rather walk a few blocks to get to some of the more established and welcoming coffee shops like Songbird on Roosevelt or JoBot on 5th."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I'm a regular to an extent. This place is wonderful! The interior is similar to the inside of a person's house, so it gives you a cozy ambience. The staff are so nice and friendly, that they would always greet you with a smile. They make sure that they know your name for your order and their food is always fresh and delicious. I always do takeout because of school, but I wouldn't mind staying there and studying for a bit. They DO play music out loud inside and outside, so if their music does suit you, just plug in your earbuds or headphones and listen to your own music. The best thing about this place is that they're not always busy. Most of the customers that go here are chill."}
{"text":"Been here twice in two months. Not impressed. The barista, who was working in the back, acted like I was interrupting something very important. No smile, no eye contact...nothing. She was bordering on rude. 

The  coffee is just so so and waaaaaaay to expensive for mediocre coffee. Even though I work close by, I won't be going back.  I'm thinking they won't last there. It's been empty each time I've gone. 

Too bad, we need a good coffe place that's close by. Maybe I better get a Kuerig."}
{"text":"Ok, I don't want to hear any more complaining about how high Starbuck's prices are...this place is nowhere near cheap, but it's good.  I love the location because I can walk to it from my apartment, and that's important when you don't want to loose your amazing streetside parking space! I usually get a latte no matter where I am, but their mocha's are amazing! They don't use as much syrup as Starbucks, but if you want soy be prepared to pay a hefty price for a small.  I love walking in and hearing loud music from local bands playing. I love the feeling of an old time coffee bar, and that is worth the price.  4/5 stars only because they don't give discounts to Roosevelt Square tenants...just church going folks.  :( Either way, they will be seeing me more often."}
{"text":"Awesome little place! Staff is extremely friendly and knowledgable of their menu and the source of all items. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Was in town on a business trip, decided to try this in search of a good coffee. 

The coffee was good I think, the reason I don't really know is because in my iced coffee it was 95% ice. I couldn't even get my straw to the bottom of the cup. The absolute worst part was the breakfast sandwich. It was almost inedible. The bagel was not toasted, the eggs were cold and dry. Only upside was the fresh tomatoes. 

There are other breakfast options in the area, I would recommend trying those instead."}
{"text":"So I got lucky enough to try out their new veggie (locally sourced, healthy eating, save the world) menu. Simply amazing. It felt so good to actually have eaten a true vegetarian meal. Everything they offered was flavorful, but I find myself still dreaming about the carrot salad. It was lightly seasoned with (maybe) cinnamon or cardamom. The cucumber dill salad and the bulgar wheat lentil loaf were yummy too. The catch? Right now they only offer two or three of the 10-12 items for lunch, so the offerings change daily (check their Facebook page for the day's plate). AND, wrapping this up in grand fashion, the veggie plate of the day costs $5-6! Sustainable for the planet and your wallet!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place because of the beliefs of its co-owner, Michelle and the staff.

I discovered Black Pearl Poetry at this place; they made themselves available for a natural hair meetup and kept themselves open until 9:30PM on a non-school Saturday night so that Phonetic Spit could have a fundraiser in the subterranean plaza. 

This place lives its 'fair trade' philosophy.  They now have a liquor license. I hope that will allow them a great spike in revenue and hours of operation.

Now, if they could improve the taste of that fair trade coffee ..."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for a coffee, snack, or lunch. I like this location better than the one a couple blocks north at the Roosevelt Square apartments. This one is cleaner, more organized, and the tables aren't all rickety. Plus, they have more seating, or so it seems. The food and sweets are the same at both locations. Fair Trade is a nice option for lunch versus all the other quick serve cafes that are in this area. 

I've had various cookies, brownies, and iced coffees and tea at both locations. They are all delicious, and sometimes there are unique options, such as today was a curry/peanut butter/chocolate cookie. I don't know that I could taste any curry, but the cookie is very delicious.  For lunch, I typically get a hummus/veggie sandwich, and they really pack it with some mixed greens, spinach, tomatoes, and some spicy hummus. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich and said it was great too. 

The location is nice, because although it's in downtown Phoenix, it is downstairs, so there's not the excess noise of traffic or anything. You can choose to sit inside or outside. 

Also, the music choices at both locations are always excellent. Today I heard Frightened Rabbit and The National while eating my lunch. 

The only complaints I have is that it can seem pricey if you order a few things, and also, depending on day, it can be kind of slow to get your order. Also, I purchased gift cards for some people at this location, and they have told me I can only use them here, versus at both locations. That kind of stinks, since I like going to both."}
{"text":"i'm a caffeine and coffee shop junkie but i hadn't really explored the awesomeness that central phoenix has to offer until recently. i really like fair trade- the prices are good, the service was good, and the coffee was amazing! at one point, their credit card machine went down and they still made my drink and didn't charge me until they could accept my card. the spot is nice and they do have a bit of outdoor seating for us nasty smokers-will be adding it to my caffeine fix list!"}
{"text":"ASU's downtown campus is slightly void of nearby coffee shops, especially if you only have 15 minutes between classes. There is a Starbucks on the first floor of Taylor Place, but who would want to go there when a gem like Fair Trade Cafe is right around the corner?

Fair Trade offers a wonderful variety of drinks that can be made quickly so you can go in, order, receive your drink, and go to class. 

If you're in the mood for something cold, they fresh brew China Mist iced tea (a local Arizona company!) and they also offer toddy-brew (cold brew) coffee. It's smooth an naturally flavorful, to add cream or sugar is nearly a sin! 

If you'd prefer a hot drink, their peppermint rose tea is perfect for a cold morning or evening. I'm 99% sure they even make their own tea combinations in-house, so you know the tea leaves you're getting are fresh. As for hot coffee, you can never go wrong with a latte.

My personal favorite food from Fair Trade is the jalapeño-cilantro hummus plate. It's loaded with carrots, celery, cucumber, almond shavings and pita chips. It's perfect for a quick and healthy lunch. If you'd rather consume something with meat or fish, their tuna melt is one of the best I've ever found in Phoenix. Honestly, you could order basically anything off their menu and be pleased.

I give it 4 stars because it's not the original location. If you want the full FTC experience, you have to visit their original location. It's a lot more relaxed without the \"I'm a busy student, I need to get my homework done, I need to get to class!\" vibe."}
{"text":"Fair Trade is a little oasis in downtown Phoenix. It's in the basement of the building, and the patio has a zen-like water feature, so it's a good place to chill - especially to escape the Phoenix heat. 

I was all set to give them a five star review, but my last visit was a bit meh so they need to earn the star back. The menu has a few vegan items that I like - in particular the mini salad and the hummus plate. The mini salad is the best in the area. Some days you just want a small salad for under $5 and theirs is delicious. It includes spring mix and spinach, dried cranberries, carrots, tomatoes, and other veggies, with a basic balsamic dressing. I also like the hummus plate, which is normally served with pita chips and veggies. It's a thicker hummus, and spicy! 

My meh experience this week was that I called in to order a mini salad. When I went to pick it up, they told me they were out of spring mix. I was going to order the hummus plate instead but saw they had a special for a hummus plate and coffee for $4. Bargain! But, when I got the hummus it didn't have chips. I asked and was told that for the special they were just doing veggies because it was a \"brain food\" special for students. Given that what I ordered initially wasn't available, I thought they'd throw some chips in when I asked, but nah. So, meh. 

I will definitely be back, but they need to work on order management a bit more.

One other note - they used to offer vegan spring rolls that were literally the best in the valley. The peanut sauce was tremendous. I still crave it. I don't know why they took it off the menu, but I WANT IT BACK. Or at least the recipe!"}
{"text":"Awesome location, average coffee, poor ambiance.   

While I've never been a huge fan of the original Fair Trade, I was glad to see that at least a locally owned shop was opening up in the Civic Space, but after my first two visits I'm underwhelmed.  Same average coffee and food as the original (although I do give high marks to their Italian Sodas), but ZERO ambiance.  Sorry but patio furniture (uncomfortable at that), does not belong inside a coffee shop.   Hopefully they are waiting for real furniture to arrive, and will migrate the patio furniture outside where it belongs.  

Another downside is the fact that the don't seem well set up for studying and co-working. While I'm not a huge fan of computers in coffee shops, they are now ubiquitous and should be well accommodated (especially in a place that will be frequented by university students). As it is, several of the outlets are near the ceiling (sorry but Shaq is no longer in town). Moreover, they don't seem to have their own wifi, but are relying on ASU's connections.

I'll chalk this initial impression up to opening week chaos, and hope that in a few weeks they'll have finished decorating and added some art to warm the place up as well as couches, easy chairs and loungers and some decent bistro tables."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times. I remembered it from awhile ago and now that I''m on asu campus I thought going back would be great- I loved it when I use to go. That being said I then realized there are two in downtown (one on 1st ave by roosevelt-this is not the one by civic space park!) I'm convinced any positive review on this page is people commenting on the wrong fair trade.

I've gotten the same barista working every time. Short dark hair. She is easily the rudest most unhelpful person I've ever met for no apparent reason. She just walks up to you pissy and doesn't say a single word and just stares at you.

Whoever designed the place did a crap job too. The menu is super confusing and unclear about what your options are- especially in terms of non-drink items. Considering no one who works there is nice enough to say a word to you it makes it even more difficult. 
I'm also a person who listens to music pretty loud and the music here is so loud you have to really raise your voice just to order something.
I gave it a few tries thinking maybe I just had 1 bad experience and 3 strikes- you're out.
Never going back, and never recommending it."}
{"text":"Honest to God, Sheriff Joe's jail is more comforting than this venue (trust me, and don't ask why, but I know). So here's to hoping that they just opened earlier than they had wanted to, 'cause right now this maybe the coldest coffee shop I've been in since Drip. Or maybe they just don't want you hanging around, and if that's the case they certainly have succeeded with flying colors. 

As at this point in time (1st week) they have ONE comfortable piece of furniture and all the rest are bare metal chairs. 

The space certainly does have potential with their big outdoor patio. And by the looks of it they will have a hot kitchen sometime in the future. 

As for the coffee, it's okay but nothing special, and/but don't expect any orange flavor for your Italian soda 'cause they don't seem to think it's worthy of stocking (at either stores).

Unfortunately Lux still has no competition in this town ..."}
{"text":"I go to the Fair Trade Cafe right up the street on Roosevelt, so I thought this would be somewhat comparable. I was certainly wrong. They have a very limited lunch menu which doesn't make much sense considering their location. The customer service is average at best and the place just isn't very comfortable. I don't mind paying extra for the whole fair trade idea, but considering the customer service and ambiance, it's definitely worth it to walk a couple of blocks to the one on Roosevelt."}
{"text":"Coffee is grrat and the food is good too. This place has an awesome coffee-shop vibe. Discounts available for ASU students and outdoor seating as well!! Lady working in the morning is very sweet. I'm coming back!!"}
{"text":"I've been meeting friends for the past two weeks at the cafe for projects.  Nice cafe, descent mochas..little pricey for a medium mocha and rice krispy treat, $7 all together, but then again you do get free wi fi!  Service is good, the girls liked to flirt with my male friends, which 'Hey\" it will make the boys tip well and passing out free samples does help sell the food!  Even though it seems pricey, it' has good drinks, clean tables, friendly staff, \"free\" wi-fi..hopefully it won't go out of business anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. They have an excellent food selection as well. And I must say, the veggie burrito is amazing!!! I also love how they give back to the community. It makes supporting this establishment, that much better. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food and drinks. Also has vegan options on the menu and vegan cookies (a vegan's dream). However, they never seem to get any orders right. There seems to be a great lack of communication amongst the cashier and barista and the back room where the food is made. I don't recommend coming here if you are in any kind of rush. They have completely forgotten about my order on more than 1 occasion. My black coffee often has grounds in it and is not very good.
That aside, it's a great atmosphere to sit and work (though outlets are very limited) and I continue returning for the loose leaf tea."}
{"text":"After visiting this place twice in 2 days I gotta say my opinion of this place did a complete 360. First impression of this place wasn't too hot as they were just opening up from winter break. Because of this I didn't get to experience their array of baked goods or their breakfast.

 I ordered a single espresso and the cafe au lait. The espresso was pretty much a double size-wise and packed a wallop as I was buzzin for a good part of the day. Cafe au lait was milky to the point teetering on excessive to some people but I loved it. While the product was fine day 1 the ambiance was pretty dead especially compared to the Starbucks 1 block down campus.

Normally I don't visit places twice (even places I like lol) but because of a photo assignment I came back the next day to take some photos of the food offerings and boy was I glad that I did. They had their breakfast up and running and the loaded potatoes I got were a healthy mess of goodness with spinach, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and peppers. Their white peach blossom tea was excellent and I appreciated that it was a loose leaf version made by the China Mist company in Scottsdale. 

The staff here is friendly but pretty quiet matching the ambiance of the place. Looking online it looks like they have a pretty extensive menu so I hope to see that coming to this location soon. 

Also make sure to show your ID I completely forgot to show my Sun Card both times and missed out on the discount. Guess I don't look like a student anymore :(

tldr; Quiet, Local, Organic, Pretty good value"}
{"text":"Terrific people and vibe. It's a wonderful space to use as a study spot with ASU's wifi supplying the fastest speed of any of the coffee spaces. Delicious treats and sandwiches along with yogurt parfait and juices. Outdoor seating with fountains. I personally love the Iced Americano best."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here 2 days in a row. The \"everything but the egg\" was simple, yet amazing! The 2nd day I tried the \"some like it hot\"...a much heartier bagel sandwich, equally amazing 
    I stumbled onto this place while marveling at the grotesque waste of tax money they call public \"art\" (i call it the butterfly net) which can, at least serve as a landmark for this wonderful little coffee shop.
     A hidden gym in a land of the big chain coffee monopoly. (They also own Seattles's  Best. Google it)"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've been here a few times now and each time I've ordered either the chai tea or the pineapple of my eye smoothie. I like both but the service always takes too long and the cashiers seem very ready to swipe my card, making me ask for the student discount every time."}
{"text":"This little shop is in an amazing location, has great food and drinks, and does not compromise their morals for a dollar. My kind of place! The atmosphere inside is lacking but i have a feeling it will come around as the place is really new."}
{"text":"The atmostphere of this place met my expectations, BUT, the coffee was disgusting. I asked for an iced coffee and then had to put my own cream and sugar in it and there was WAY too much ice. Not only did the coffee taste ashy, but the fact that the barista was rude and acted confused when I asked for cream and sugar after I paid and exorbitant amount for a small coffee made me more bitter than the coffee itself. I haven't gone back since and was upset at the hype."}
{"text":"Did I ever mention how much I love the Yelp app for the iPhone? Well, I love it. Honestly, I'd make it a dry martini, light its cigar, cook it dinner with a piping hot apple streusel  for dessert every night if I could. Seriously.

So today we, the app and I, decided that we were in need of some good coffee, and wanted to try something new. Starbucks on campus is old news to us. It was my choice to find a place close enough to campus because I have a knack for wandering about downtown...I get a bit curious and then end up being late to class sometimes...Kind of like I'm going to be right about now, while writing this review, but who cares, I'm past due on writing one. 

What we \"found\" was Fair Trade. Now I don't blame app, because it is truly wonderful and could never do any wrong in my eyes...but I just could not find this place for the life of me off of the map I was given. Lo' and behold, I was practically standing on top of it. Now you may start to understand right about here why I needed coffee this morning...

I've never been a coffee person and never will be. I know its hard to believe with all the past reviews that just happen to have me purchasing and consuming coffee, but truly, I'm a tea drinker. The beverage board was straight forward, perfect for my mind state, and had reasonable prices. I decided on a Large Iced Coffee. Simple and plenty enough to do the job of waking my cerebrum up. It only came to $2.25, with the student discount, which I was nicely informed about at the register, thank you to the friendly cashier, she rocks! Won over, entirely, just with the price, and I hadn't even tried the coffee. 

I got even more adventurous today too. I drank it black. And you know what, I like it like this. This would have to be the first time ever. I've had black iced coffee elsewhere and its bitterness wasn't even dulled by the tons of artificial sweetener I dumped into it. Kudos Fair Trade for not turning my stomach!

Maybe I'm a bit twisted, what am I talking about, of course I'm twisted, but I love the decor here. Its different. I like different. I wouldn't say its the most comforting looking place, but its almost like it was built just to have people come and go with their beverages and food. Almost like a small cafe located near a train. Hah, that's right it is next to a train! If that's what you're willing to call the lightrail. Shame on all of you that haven't warmed up to it, its no BART, but I like it! And I like this Fair Trade location, and look forward to future mornings together! Because who wouldn't want to wake up with me in the morning?!"}
{"text":"i decided to stop by after hearing great reviews from my fellow students. I ordered a veggie hummus sandwich. There was one ticket in front of mine (I heard her call out the ticket orders). A group of three girls came in after me followed by another customer. They all ordered and sat down. One after another all four people got their orders and I still had not received mine. After about 25 minutes, I enquired about where my order was (to the man working in the kitchen and delivering the food) and how four people who came in after me had already received their food. His response was that they work on the easiest orders first and that mine should be up soon. Personally, I didn't think a hummus sandwich was overly difficult. After another 5 minutes had passed, the woman who rang up my order asked if I still had not received my food, I told her no and repeated what I had been told. She apologized profusely and another employee (I'm assuming a manager) also apologized. Within minutes she rushed to the kitchen and began to personally work on my order. She also offered me a free pastry and tea for my trouble. While I was convinced I would give them a bad review, they were able to redeem themselves, continued to apologize, and did everything they could to make up for the slow service. Honestly, I will probably try them again seeing as how the do have a lot of great reviews. Plus, my sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The atmosphere is fantastic, they truly make you feel like you're at home and part of the family. The food is phenomenal and in my opinion, very affordable considering it is all healthy and natural ingredients. This is one place I don't mind eating at every day. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Super stoked to see this shop open in the Civic Center Park.  Another step in the right direction, Phoenix!

It's a coffee shop, but I met up there for lunch and tried a veg and hummous salad which was just great.  Freshly made sandwich, homemade hummous, good stuff.  

Limited menu, hope to see it grow, I'll be back for sure.  

The space was noisy, but it's so new I'm sure they are still working out the kinks.  

Check it out.  And the patio is going to be fab!"}
{"text":"i liked the location more then the original. but i liked the people at the original more. it's not like there is anything wrong with the people at the new location. i just was like super regular at the original location..so i didn't feel like a nobody. :-/
