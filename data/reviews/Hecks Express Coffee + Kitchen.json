{"text":"Perfect place to quickly get some fresh & well prepared food. It's also perfect to sit around and do homework or hangout with friends. It's the perfect atmosphere! The food tastes amazing and the dining area looks so cool! They play great music and there's a projector that plays sports games, shows and more. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We are visitors from Florida here for the Cavs game and had a chance to have lunch at Hecks. Excellent spot to eat - nothing fancy but extra clean and modern look. Loved the place !! Highly Recommend their fries and Steak Sandwich !!"}
{"text":"Great burger and great Pure Cane beverages. Such a great atmosphere and the staff was very accommodating. Will def frequent this place again and recommend it. One of the only nice things in Cleveland we have encountered."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get. I ordered the Savory Gouda Pastry which was very small and was not savory or had any trace of Gouda, and an iced coffee (cup was approximately 8oz). I paid close to $9.00 for those two items and was very disappointed. Due to the high price I probably won't be returning. 

With all of the competition around serving pastry and coffee, I would expect Hecks to be more competitively priced. You can go down the street and find 2-3 other places that serve better quality food and coffee for less.

Pro: The inside was very nice and modern. It looked very clean."}
{"text":"How has this place been open since September and  we just found out about it? The menu is awesome-great variety and everything looked good. I went with the avocado toast and a green juice. It was amazing! The decor inside is really fun, too. I'll be back for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious avocado toast and juice! Cute, quick & casual bite to eat in downtown Cleveland. Would recommend getting both of these on your visit here - I enjoyed!"}
{"text":"When you walk through the door you suddenly realize this isn't your typical breakfast diner. You're invited into a very modern and clean dining room where words like fresh + simple appear on the wall. Walk right up to the counter and order away at this street food atmospheric establishment. Take your breakfast to go or stay and enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland to see the Cavs game and after a bad experience at the Chocolate Bar we walked over to Hecks and I'm SO glad we did. I got a burger with fries and a Nutella milkshake...all so good. The burger was absolutely delicious and a really good size. The milkshake was drinkable right away, not how they usually come when they're frozen and you have to wait to drink it. My boyfriend got a breakfast sandwich and said it was really good as well! Highly recommend this place for brunch if you're nearby!"}
{"text":"Great business, Heck's knows how to treat customers. The owner genuinely cares about your comfort. Workers are friendly and sincere"}
{"text":"Heck's Express - the new hip place to chill, study, smash, and be healthy. Bonus: grapefruit moisturizer in the bathrooms"}
{"text":"I've had hit or miss experiences at the Hecks restaurant, but this place was a lifesaver on a busy Saturday night. Didn't realize how long the waits would be at the other restaurants close by so we ended up getting dinner here. It was delicious! I enjoyed an orange and beet salad topped with candied walnuts and my fave, goat cheese.  I was surprised at how large the salad was, definitely enough for a meal. At that point, I'd already ordered the grilled cheese so we just had to power through.  I enjoyed the combination of cheeses with the tomato jam (a little sweet and salty). Bread was a little too crusty for my taste, but didn't ruin the sandwich.  I didn't find the salad or sandwich to be overpriced, not sure how much their pastries are.  Service was awesome although to be fair, it wasn't that crowded.  I imagine this is a nice place for the weekday lunch crowd or if you want fast casual, but not a large burrito."}
{"text":"Very under-impressed, I came here and there were 1-2 vegan options. I'm peskitarian and my girlfriend is vegan, I settled for the salmon dish and she had a salad. For a place with the word \"EXPRESS\" in the name you would think you would get your meal reasonably fast. Not this Friday, lmfao this place is s joke. My Salmon was over cooked and here salad greens were wilted. Never again I will go to Portion on Ontario at least the salad greens are fresh!"}
{"text":"The steak and egg bagel is phenomenal! I had it once on a whim and went back to get it again for myself and boyfriend 3 days later! The vibes and overall aesthetic are also amazing!"}
{"text":"Downtown really needs a place like this! Open early and on the weekends.

They have great coffee and I loved the omelet. I'm excited to try more of their lunch and dinner items.

My only gripe is that the staff kept making suggestions after I had given my order. I appreciate the suggestions (they were the same price), but for the sake of speed I just wanted to stick to my original order.

Don't mind the construction - this place is open and wonderful!"}
{"text":"Nice, fresh, modern place. Only came in for a quick drink but the service and drink were solid. Enjoyed the fireplace."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ate their burger and fries for dinner and now is violently ill with food poisoning. I had to revise my previous review to three stars, while I still don't recommend the burger, their coffee and sweets are great! Perfect when you need something fast!"}
{"text":"Cool hipster place. Nice decor inside. My friends dishes all looked amazing and the coffee was really good. It's served in a large mug and fancy looking. 

The price was fair, only 7-8 bucks for a meal. Portions were ok. I do have a few complaints though. They ran out of the yogurt for my açaí bowl so I had green yogurt instead which was ehh. Also, it's self-serve like Panera which is ok, not a complaint just a note. 

I'd return for brunch again but I'll get something with eggs and Home fries next time."}
{"text":"I had the Rocky River burger, a side order of fries and a Diet Coke. Total $14.58 which I thought was a bit pricey. The burger was good. I think most folks would find the fries a bit salty. I will come back to try some of the other lunch offerings, but will avoid arriving right around noon as there is only one person taking orders at the counter. I must say though that once my order was in, it was quickly prepared!"}
{"text":"I went into this place with a lot of hope and excitement. What I experienced was sort of lackluster.

This restaurant is in a seriously prime, convenient place downtown. I work down the street, and I live perhaps a 5 minute walk from Heck's Express. My friend was in from out of town, and I wanted to take her somewhere I haven't been before, so after a night of partying, we woke up on Sunday morning and walked on over.

I can't say anything negative about the help. The staff was wonderful. The restaurant had a great aura and was very clean and simple.

What bothers me is the food...

I ordered the veggie hash with eggs. I do have to say the prices were rather steep for what I ordered. The hash was different: containing beets, and several other veggies...but I've fried better eggs and made better hashes in my kitchen.

I feel they just need to re-price or rethink the menu. It's a great location, and it's hard to see them waste such a great opportunity for success with their food."}
{"text":"Oh my god, everything here was so good. Was staying nearby and didn't even notice this place til I found it on yelp - scaffolding covers up the front so you don't even notice it next to the Arcade.

But super yummy choices - for a picky California foodie this was still divine.  I really wanted to be able to keep coming back and trying everything on the menu.

Got:
--avocado toast: wow, super heavenly.  Very generous portion but more importantly they do something with lemon in this dish that was subtle but really made it not your usual avocado toast. Yum.

--acai bowl:  A different texture than acai bowls in Ca. (cuz they used frozen yogurt, which then made the granola freeze too, which was not my favorite - also the granola was good but not as delectable as at Bloom's down the street). But this was still delicious overall and I would get again, even if I'd let it sit and defrost a bit.

--caprese salad: didn't look quite like the photo on FB, the tomato was not chopped up and I had to mix everything together myself. but it was still a very tasty salad.

I didn't have time to try or order:
--the steel cut oatmeal with coconut and cocoa nibs
--the lavender latte, the coconut turmeric latte
--or to try the extremely very delicious looking multigrain croissant. The plain croissant looked questionable, but the multigrain one looked like the real deal.

Food did take longer to prepare than one might expect from fast casual. But they're making it from scratch. For my second visit I called ahead.  Lovely place!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've had breakfast and lunch here and both meals were delicious. The staff is great and very welcoming. The menu has a mix of classic favorites and modern twists! I had the Thai Cobb Salad with Chicken today for lunch and the portion was huge for a salad and everything was fresh and delicious. Can't wait to come back and try a smoothie bowl!"}
{"text":"I have no quibbles with the quality of the food, but the quantity leaves something to be desired for the prices they charge. There are better values to be had in a downtown that's replete with solid lunch places. On the plus side, the space is lovely and the people are really nice."}
{"text":"The menu is a great addition that downtown badly needed. Favorites are the breakfast sandwich, green machine, and the orange and beet salad. Usually call for pickup and they are ready within 10 minutes. And the food is fabulous! It's the perfect extension off of the Ohio City location, with a more hip menu."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Food came out quickly and was fantastic, I have stuck to the burgers but the all day breakfast will be my next move. Only hangup for some might be the rosemary ketchup is strong. Personally would dump their malt vinegar aioli on everything!"}
{"text":"There is currently scaffolding covering the entrances. The way to get in is on the northeast side of Euclid by the pizza place. The fries are really good and they were very generous with the amount of sauces you could try. Everyone who I was with enjoyed their meal and the atmosphere was cool but not rowdy."}
