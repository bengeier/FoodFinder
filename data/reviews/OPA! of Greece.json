{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, with great pitas and delicious chewy gyros to my delight! This place cooks and serves food fast and quick, so if you're ever in a hurry, this is the place to quickly grab a pita while on your way, with the convenience of holding your food with ease while walking to your plane. Gyros could be a bit less chewy, but nonetheless, was very tasty either way. The toppings were filled with color and unique tastes from tomatoes to jalape√±os. Green onions and you name it! Service was average, the cashier taking care of us was kind and understanding. Nothing too much or too little. The design of the little restaurant was clean and average, and had not too much of a selection from the menu but I believe they all tastes equally good.

In conclusion, the food there is delicious and spectacular. The ease of getting your food in a hurry is convenient, and the variety of toppings is truly amazing. Service and the design of the restaurant was average. Menu didn't have too much to pick but does still have a decent amount of topics to choose from. Thus, giving this a five star for its spectacular speed, food, and convenience. Happy eating travelers!"}
{"text":"How refreshing to have a dining option like this in an airport! Great menu and decent value. I had the chicken pita with fries. The chicken was tasty, the pita soft and warm, with fresh diced jalapenos, it was perfect. Fries were hot and crisp. YYC, I have a new favorite go-to spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is fairly new, but very mismanaged. Tables, floor, counter tops, and kitchen were dirty. Staff was extremely hard to understand. They were not very polite either. Food was cold and tasteless. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast wrap!! I am truly amazed at how good it was. I don't review places often but this place gets full marks."}
{"text":"Good breakfast wrap, freshly made with egg. Cheaper than other options and better.  Nice servers, fast, pleasant and polite"}
{"text":"The old us departures had like two places and was a waste of time, opa is one of my favourite \"fast foods\" two times I've flown through US I've eaton here and was quite happy!"}
{"text":"VERY happy with the falafel wrap I ordered. Very tasty and all the ingredients were fresh. I love when I can pick and choose what I want on my wrap. AND they were very generous with the tahini which I LOVE! The gentleman that made my wrap was super friendly too."}
{"text":"Got a lamb wrap and it tasted phenomenal!! Never really tried Greek food but this was very good."}
{"text":"Located in the new E concourse this place has a nice variety of Greek salads and offerings. There is ample seating and good ppl watching from your table."}
{"text":"Truly surprised about this good airport food. The US terminal at YYC had a food court and I ended up deciding for this chain. Located in the new Concourse E this place has a nice variety of Greek salads, Pitas and other offerings. I ended up getting the chicken pita platter with fries.

Their staff was really friendly and very quick, all in all between ordering and pick up not 5 minutes passed. Food was delicious and hot. The portions are huge and I was able to bring left overs on board for later.
The prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"Shockingly good airport fast food.

Wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. Super friendly employees (LOVE that about Canada in general), great prices, and moderately healthy and flavorful food.

The portions are huge- or at least the fries that came with the falafel wrap, the falafel wrap itself, the Greek salad, and the spanakopita all were. I didn't realize it but I totally ended up ordering enough for two hungry people.

Their tzatziki was mighty tasty and great for dipping the fries in and I requested some spicy sauce on my falafel and it really kicked it up a notch. The shrimp skewers were a little too salty, even for a sodium addict like myself, but I still wouldn't let that stop me from getting it again and I'm multiples.

I don't know the next time I'll be hanging at the Calgary airport but I know I'll be eating here when I'm back."}
{"text":"Dirty dirty dirty. The food was cold... I mentioned to the staff, how dirty the tables, floors and countertops ... they rather be in the back sitting on their phones instead of making sure the place is clean and sanitized. There was food under every table, and on the seating, but when the man came to clean the area he brought paper towel and stopped as soon as we left, he made sure to watch us drive off, very strange. Thanks for the food poisoning."}
{"text":"I had a really early morning flight that got delayed, so I stopped by here to grab some breakfast. I got a gyro pita wrap with everything as well as baklava, and they were both surprisingly good. The gyro meat was quite tender and flavorful, and the sauce and vegetables were quite fresh. The baklava wasn't too sweet and the outside was crunchy which was nice. A bit pricey though, but I guess it is airport food after all; this came out to be around $10 (CAD)."}
{"text":"Didn't want fast food and didn't want to spend a fortune at a sit down airport restaurant. I also wanted gluten free so limited options. I am not celiac but for other health reasons I avoid gluten. I went with a kids meal which had a chicken skewer and rice and tzatziki. It also has some pita if you want. The chicken was over cooked a bit and bland as well as the rice. You're gonna need that Tzatziki sauce. I also got Opa Fries which are just fries with Tzatziki. The fries were pretty good and the portion was huge. Be nice if they seasoned them to make them more than just fries. Over all I was full and mostly gluten free and the price was not bad for the airport"}
{"text":"Skimpy with giving you food you pay for. Got calamari and Caesar salad. No bacon, no parmesan cheese, hardly any dressing in the lettuce. Received my food and there's barely anything in there to eat. Way to go guys! Nothing makes my day better than paying $12 to wait in line for 15 minutes and receive hardly any food. Cheers.."}
{"text":"2 stars:
First: dirty..
Second: dirty
Third: dirty

Now, dunno when they opened but I'm guessing less than 4 months omg...the container of their cutleries....dirty!
The tables....dirty!
Since its new...I would give them benefit of a doubt that the kitchen...cross my fingers is clean.
Being in food service everything gotta be clean.  No its and buts...

Also, no uniform...I don't get it...is it because they are the owners...dunno

One thing I know I will not go back there. Which is a shame. Since its in a shopping complex there are other restaurants I can choose...

I would like to see he head office to cone in and check on this branch."}
