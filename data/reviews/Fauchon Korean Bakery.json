{"text":"This Korean bakery is found in the corner of a very 'sketchy' strip mall, and as noted by Soleil, a bit difficult to find.  A friend referred me here, and boy this is probably the only place I'm buying my cakes for now on! Amazing, high quality cakes, with loving owners; who wouldn't love this place?  I bought fruit cake, strawberry shortcake, and sweet potato variants, and each have had their own delights.  I have to say, my all time favourite would be the sweet potato though! :) I've actually told my sister from Guelph about this place, and she comes every other week just because she loves their cakes!  Also, everytime I've been here the sweet lady at the cashier always has wonderful gifts for me! Warning though, there was quite a language barrier the first time I went (lol i like asking a lot of questions before buying ok), but all turned out well.  The husband and wife couple understand sufficient english for you to just stop by and pick up a cake.    

In terms of atmosphere, it is simple but has a cute ring to it.  There were quite a few baskets of different buns which I have yet to try! Also, pricing here is moderately expensive in terms of size, as a ~6 inch cake was about $20, but after tasting it, the flavour definitely justified its price.  This isn't just another Asian bakery selling hotdog buns but quite a gem in the city of Mississauga."}
{"text":"Fauchon Bakery is a Korean Immigrant family run bakery. In case you didn't figure it out yet (full disclosure), I am Korean. Don't be fooled by the size of the place, the variety of the offerings is very adequate and the pastries, breads and cakes are world class. The cream breads are to die for. My wife asks me when are we going there again? (Yes, we are from the States). The owner is very nice, friendly and professional. It's a niche bakery but I would describe it as the \"Biggest Little Korean Bakery\" around. I would recommend it very highly! BTW, their red bean ice dessert and tea are delicious too."}
{"text":"Fauchon Bakery is hidden in plain view... Literally. No where in this shady strip mall do you see the words Fauchon on the storefront signage or even on the street view sign.  If you're standing in the parking lot, you might see the tiny flimsy banner attached to the fence that says Fauchon.  This is not the French Fauchon where pastries and macaron reign ... This is a tiny and spartan Korean bakery but holds a few delights.

The decor and atmosphere can be best described as sparse but clean.  Not a single word of English is spoken here but the smiling attempts of the Korean staff makes it a warm atmosphere.  The shelves are not stocked well and they are only 8 types of Korean buns.  Chestnut, red bean, whipped cream, your beloved hot dog wiener bun, and a few cookie crusted buns for the cases.  All of them are well priced at $1.10 or less and freshly made.

The items that drew my attention were unusual for something in a small place like this... Red bean shaved ice, fairly large macaron, and genuinely nice looking cakes in the centre case.

Another couple ordered the shaved ice and they were attacking the sugary condensed milk mound.  It had lots of red beans on it and the ice looked finely shaved as well .  They definitely did not skimp on the toppings.

The macaron here were much larger than the usual loonie or toonie sized macaron. I got 3 of then and though these were the more expensive item  ($2 / macaron), the shells were nicely done.  They were crisp, properly filled, and had the soft interior.  They were light on flavour in the shells but I sincerely appreciate the better fillings.  The use of in house made strawberry cream cheese in the strawberry macaron added a nice tanginess to counter the sweet shell.  The white chocolate ganache was wisely used for the lemon flavour to temper the citrus note. And the apricot filling had white chocolate to compliment the natural tartness.

The cakes in the case surprised me because they were a notch above compared to most Asian bakeries.  Most of the time, it's just a half decent Swiss roll or a flavourless whipped cream white cake with canned fruit as part of the fillings.  These were skillfully decorated using fondant or buttercream and with ingredients normally saved for higher end bakeries.  Green tea cake with white chocolate ganache.  Vanilla cake with red bean ganache and fondant... The fusion style definitely interested me to come here for a cake .

Overall this is a good place to stop by if you happen to be at the restaurants nearby.... If you can find it !"}
