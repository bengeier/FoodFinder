{"text":"The lady who took my order through the drive through was absolutely friendly and pleasant.  Unfortunately the food is a greasy mess. Way too much breading and grease for the small bit of fish and the fries were more mushy than crispy fried.  Suppose I should've expected it, but people always say this chain is so great.  I have to disagree my friends."}
{"text":"It's clean! Service is good.
But the food...put it this way - my cat wouldn't even eat the fish."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Ordered fish and chips. Food was already cooked, laying under heat lamps. Was OK, not cooked to order. Fish was kind of soggy and mushy inside. Could of been cooked fresh to order and served burning HOT. French fries were good. Clam chowder was EXCELLENT. Haven't been to Arthur Treachers since 1982, which was back in Bismarck, North Dakato. Would return again when in area."}
{"text":"Food was made fresh to order, service was excellent. Young, very polite gentleman named Kyle couldn't have been more helpful.  This employee is an outstanding asset to your restaurant.  My fiancee is a restaurant manager with 15 plus yrs and would love to have employee's of his caliber. 
Restaurant was clean,  and the fish and chicken was excellent."}
{"text":"Placed my order and to my surprise when I pulled up to the drive thru window to pay I was greeted by a young man wearing  a \" make America great again \" ball cap . I asked if it was normal for a fast food chain to back a political candidate . His reply was if I didn't like it don't eat there .
Drove off and left my order behind . It's nice a chain can afford to give up customers by letting their employees practice subtle racism ."}
{"text":"Restaurant was super clean. Food made fresh and hot. Best of all, the lady and son had top notch customer service. Something not found in today's fast food world. Kudos to them. Best of luck and continued success."}
{"text":"Crispy, salty, malty memories from childhood I can still eat! I adore this hold out from the heyday of fast food diversity before everything became boil-in-the-bag taco meat or mircrowaived burgers 'my way'. 

The fish is fried to perfection in the crispest batter but the white meat chicken can be the star of your plate if you let it - get both. And HUSHPUPPIES people!! Nuggets of gold delight. Yummmmm - the staff and manager treat you so well you feel like you're at a fine dining place. Clean, bright dining room and ample parking."}
{"text":"Arthur Treachers! We moved away but when we come back to the area, I have to eat here. Fish n chips with malt vinegar -yum. 

This location is nice inside, and the staff today was pleasant and very accommodating, getting me another Dr Pepper right away when the machine ran out of syrup. 

There's a drive-thru for your carry-out needs, also.

I believe they may carry the fish theme into their music - sounded like the Fish coming thru the speakers. Cool with us! Thanks for a great lunch today."}
{"text":"Love this location mainly because of the customer service. Every time I visit there's I believe a blonde middle aged woman who just makes my days better.! Not to mention the food is ALWAYS hot and fresh when I order."}
{"text":"Good food- friendly help- clean, tide, hometown place. Self help counter for sauces and soda"}
{"text":"On the rare occasions that I am craving some fried seafood fast and easy, I drop in at this branch of Arthur Treacher's. I love this location because of their helpful and friendly staff. Their food is also always fresh and hot out of the fryer. I would not hesitate to return and bring friends."}
{"text":"Always fantastic service, and fresh food.The cleanest fast food restaurant I have ever been in. Tons of food Too! Employees are so professional and personable. The manager is doing a great job."}
{"text":"Nice older place. Good food! The service was very friendly. Very clean."}
