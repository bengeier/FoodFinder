{"text":"This is a friendly place where the owners are onsite all o the time.  The menu is far more extensive than the name would imply.  100% of the items I have eaten here were excellent, large servings, made of very fresh items and well worth the money.  I recommend it to you highly."}
{"text":"A nice little place and needed in Oregon. We stopped in for a quick bite after I worked late. The menu is a nice selection of American and Mexican cuisine. On the American side, they have burgers, chicken, pasta, fish and lots more. The Mexican side is huge too. If you cannot find something here, you are too picky. We wanted something quick and ordered tacos. My wife had two ground beef tacos, one on a flour tortilla and one on a corn tortilla. She was very pleased with her selection. A great taste and full tortillas. I had a blacken shrimp flour tortilla taco and a Chorizo flour tortilla taco. We also ordered chips and cheese. I asked if the cheese had salsa mixed in, thinking of chili con queso and did not get a good answer from our waitress, but I think she was new. We received chips, a cup of salsa and a cup of melted cheese. I mixed them together. The tacos were very good. The blacken shrimp taco had a good bite to it and was not Americanized with cheese, lettuce and such. It had just blacken shrimp, onions, cilantro and Pico de Gallo. Very good. The Chorizo taco was good, just not as spicy as I like them. Again, just some onions, cilantro and Chorizo. I asked for some lime wedges and received enough for my tacos. The shrimp taco was so good I ordered a grilled tilapia with Pico de Gallo. Again it was true to form. Grilled tilapia, not deep fried and not over done. If we had to judge just from this meal, we give The Loco Gringo two thumbs up for sure. Worth stopping in for a meal, for sure."}
{"text":"Really, really,really good breakfast. They have chorizo for gods sakes.  You will not regret your decision to eat here. Very attentive service too. They ask your coffee preference as soon as you walk in."}
{"text":"Service is very good but the food was average. I didn't think that the value was good compared to the quality of the food we received.  Previous reviewers are pretty happy with this place and I think based on that and the attentive and friendly service we will visit again and try different items and hope for better value.

Skip the onion rings.  They come straight out of the bag and are pretty tasteless and bland."}
{"text":"Good service, our consensus food is average at best(something you can make at home fairly easily and emulate). Bloody Mary bar was underwhelming (expecting something more along a buffet table,not just a bunch of stuff thrown out on the bar area)."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast items from egg, cheese and sausage taco to homemade pecan sticky buns, this is a great place to dine. Prices are right on, too. Cozy and inviting atmosphere and very friendly."}
