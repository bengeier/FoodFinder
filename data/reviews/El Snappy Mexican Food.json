{"text":"this place is very good and so cheap... I go at lease 2 times a week the menudo is delicious red or white, the tortas are so bomb and the chilaquiles are so bomb ... top it off with some nice people and homey feed like you are eating at a friends house and their nana is hooking you up a plate highly recommend it..."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times, stopped in this morning and had the Huevos Racheros and a couple tacos. Great food great prices and homemade tortillas that are excellent.  I will definitely be going back. Small place with about 8 tables, take cash only and have bottled coke."}
{"text":"Nice people, excellent prices, great selection, just right with spices, seems all freshly prepared! just right on the cheese with chicken enchiladas (powerfully delicious chicken enchiladas, should be in \"New Times best of \"). Sushi rolls of various types are what they are advertising as of late, can't wait to try it.

Very clean and pleasant atmosphere. I love this place, proximity in downtown is hop skip leap.

Extremely understated review, you really have to go there if you like Mexican food - it's a lighter and not heavy in the stomach filling meal (yet, absolutely  filling meal), a very rare occurance for me. I'd  hate to compare it to the more expensive Mexican food restaurants, but it sits higher - much higher than most Mexican food  restaurants in central Phoenix. If this  place was in Scottsdale or smack dab in a college retail location it would've made headlines or morning show reviews already. So, it literally is a diamond in the  rough. It deserves culinary attention, and it's a pity that you have to know people  (tribalist mentality schmoozers) in order to receive well deserved representation in a metropolis overly saturated with the look and feel of Y.U.P.'y -ism."}
{"text":"I don't give them 4 stars because we have only tried 1 dish-their tamales! They are so yummy. You pre-order and they will call you when they are ready. My husband said that their customer service is really good and the lady in the back came out to help him figure out the best way to get them. Let's just say we ordered 1 dozen and in less than 24 hours between 2 of us they are gone. I don't usually like tamales because places use too much masa and too little meat. These have a good balance of both, good flavor, are only $1 and are moist too, not dry and flaky. Check them out, they are delicious! I can't wait to try more of their food. Stumbled upon them and I am hooked. Just off the I-17 too!"}
{"text":"Ordered a agua chile . 5 shrimps only and it was old shrimp. Sushi is a mess . I was happy whit there service before , but now seems like they rush all there food"}
{"text":"Food is a ok. Not the best the service is horrible. I will go  back to try the chilakiles i had the pozole and it had a lot of fat. I highly recommend them to have someone greeting people and letting them know they will be right with us"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!!!!! The only bad thing about it is that it is a very small restaurant and the seating is very limitted my family is a little big and we all dont fit in one bench and there isn't an option to put another table together... Besides that the food os AMAZING!!!!! I love it from the first bite to the very last. Im always back. Its just very great"}
{"text":"Good old fashion Mexican food, not to mention great tasting and on point, as for service, service was great !! I'd highly recommend and will be coming back. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the staff was super nice and SO CHEAP WTF! I had the tacos. All of them. They were medium sized and flavorful. The Jamaica wasn't too sweet either. This place is definitely a great value. The decor isn't much but eh who cares?"}
