{"text":"it is our first time here,very good roast jerk chicken,also drink is good. they have super spicy sauce if you like spicy."}
{"text":"Great food. Perhaps not crazy spicy like the other places in Toronto. I would say very tasty vs very spicy. The home made hot sauce is very hot. Paul is very personable which is a bonus. 

I will return. This is better than the downtown and Scarberia places I frequent."}
{"text":"I have no clue where all these yelp reviews are from because they're all wrong 

Ordered jerk chicken large dinner, side of bbq chicken and a Jamaican patty. 

First of all the jerk chicken and bbq chicken is spicy. I have no clue who told the other reviews on yelp that the jerk chicken isn't spicy. It tastes like eating hot peppers, jalape√±os and 5 different hot sauces all at once. 

Second the coleslaw isn't overly sweet. It has a little sweetness to it. Less sweet than corn. 

The food was hot, large portions, spicy and very tasty. Extremely tender.  

I'd defiantly go again but ask them to use less spice. It's too spicy for me."}
{"text":"Largest roti ever - couldn't finish mine. It was pretty delish.  Will say that the woman behind counter was so soft spoken but seemed very laid back.  I havne't been here in a few years, so it looks like it could use a bit of sprucing up here.  Also remember to bring cash with you. No cards or debit accepted."}
{"text":"Save your money! Ordered jerk chicken and rice & peas.  Chicken was cold and old. Absolutely no jerk flavor more like stew chicken but dry. As for the rice it was old and grainy....tasted stale. After a few bits this meal ended up in the garbage! Waste of money. I hope I don't get sick..."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour, do not eat this! Worse jerk and rice peas!!! Ordered rice and peas dinner size, small portion... Rice is like rocks!!! Yeah must be days old. Chicken is so freaking dry and obviously not fresh! Coleslaw taste like strong vinegar with radish and carrots!! Save your $9 go somewhere else and check u in at Mckenzie clinic! If you don't know what am I saying, toxic your body!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this out with our new skipthedish app. It arrived within the advertised time frame which was great! The food was warm and tasty. We ordered the jerk and oxtail dinner. 

Jerk dinner with rice and peas - juicy chicken pieces, rice and peas and coleslaw. Great portion, very tasty gravy and coleslaw was sooo perfect. It was crunchy and not too creamy, this is how I prefer my coleslaw. 

Oxtail dinner with rice and peas - good portion, tender meat and coleslaw.   The gravy on this was nice and thick but tasted very similar to the jerk chicken. It was still good but I prefer different seasoning since they are different dishes. 

All in all, this meal was really good. Rice was firm and not mushy, everything was well seasoned, great portions, both chicken and oxtail were cooked well! Will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely brutal 

Stomach pains from old reheated food 

Place has too be a front 

Unbelievable"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently found this hidden gem! We always end up getting the Carribean Jerk Dinner and it defiantly does not disappoint and the price, can't complain! It's tucked away in the corner next to the restaurant that use to be the Galaxy Diner. 
I highly recommend this to everyone, if you like spice ask for the homemade hot sauce and if you don't like spice then ask for no hot sauce. I would also reccomend trying their homemade drinks, not sure if they have different flavors but we tried the fruit punch and blueberry....both....AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Love the jerk chicken and oxtail from here... try the home made hot sauce! So so good!"}
