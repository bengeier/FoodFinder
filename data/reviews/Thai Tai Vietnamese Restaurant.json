{"text":"I know Thai Tai from the smaller sub restaurants but I didn't know that there was a full service, sit down restaurant in the city. Boy am I glad we stumbled across this restaurant as we were waiting for an appointment elsewhere in Aspen! 

The restaurant itself is very clean and bright. We were seated right away as it wasn't very busy on a Tuesday at 1pm. The service was quick and friendly - not overbearing (or under for that matter). The washrooms were nice, which usually says a lot about a restaurant. 

I ordered the vegetarian spring rolls on vermicelli and the Mister had the beef/chicken Vietnamese sub (from the taste I had, it was super good). My bowl was delicious! It was LOADED with incredibly fresh carrots, sprouts, lettuce, and green onions. The spring rolls were awesome; not just the meat ones with no meat, but they actually put thought into the veggie rolls by adding what I think is tofu. The sauce was sweeter than most others I've had, it was a nice twist. 

We'll definitely be back, it's well worth the drive for us!"}

{"text":"I was at Aspen Landing today and had the worst service ever.  I asked for an additional cup and straw for my bubble tea and the older lady at the reception desk said, \" it's additional $2.10\"  I said, \"for a cup and straw\"?  She said \"it's my choice whether you want to pay or not so just get out if you don't like the price\"  so I left!  I will never go back and because of the customer service."}
{"text":"The noodle soups have minimal flavour which makes it taste pretty plain. The bubble tea is excellent though. I love their mango-banana flavour! Their sandwiches are average and taste like any other vietnamese restaurant. Their name throws people off (i.e., they are not a thai restaurant but rather a vietnamese restaurant). I would definitely go back for their bubble tea, not their food."}

This place was quite interesting; my impressions of this place was Thai influenced Vietnamese food, hence \"Thai Tai Vietnamese Restaurant\" I guess lol.  They have many types of pho which I've have never seen before, like satay style pho's.  But..... I'm a traditional kind of guy and I like to see a restaurants do the basics well before I want to trust and venture out to try the crazy wild creations.  We go spring rolls, shrimp salad rolls, lemongrass chicken banh mi, and I got Pho Tai of course.

The spring roll resembled more like lumpia, (Filipino spring roll), for some reason.  No saying it was bad, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting lol.  I was gonna ask for sweet and sour or sweet thai chili sauce cause it reminded me of it so much!!

Salad roll was good.  The banh mi.... now that was a bit weird for me.  There was cheese in it!  The good thing, I only saw it and it wasn't overpowering in flavour.  Once again, not that it was bad, but it just added nothing to the sub, but the feeling that I just got a subway sub.  It was alright but way over priced!  Bread wasn't even fresh.

Pho Tai, the broth was tasty, noodles will be noodles, and the beef... well, the beef was sliced a little thicker than what I'm always used to.  It's a hit and miss for me with the me for the beef cause the thickness of the beef took longer to cook so it didn't over cook, however since the meat was slightly thicker the meat was a bit chewy rather than a thin sliced meat.

Overall the food was about 3 stars across the board for me.  I was neither impress nor disappointed.  I just wouldn't order the subs ever again for that price."}
