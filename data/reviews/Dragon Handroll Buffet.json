{"text":"Save your money and go somewhere else. Small selection and they put out very little of each food item at a time. There is actually a person standing behind the glass watching you get your food! So awkward! The price was enticing but definitely a disappointment once there."}
{"text":"As all Yelpers mentioned, it used to be 'Panda Buffet', not like it was any better. Both these buffets are not as expensive as most buffets, but also their selection is limited and very rarely refills. We went on a Sunday, as we came in around 8pm, its maybe one quarter filled restaurant.  We had 5 ppl, so business was picking up a bit, but the food on most station seems low in quantity unless we asked for it to be refilled. Interesting note on their door as you are coming in, stating on Saturday, they have 'Lobster, Crab Legs, and Oysters'...Sounds nice too, but maybe limited supply per person.  Lucky for us, there was crab legs, but limited again. They have fried shrimp, fried calamari, barbecue pork, some veggie, two soups, noodles, and a bit of sushi (don't eat it), chicken wings, simple veggie fried rice.   Funny thing is I'd ask for the refill on crab legs, and this lady in the back would put a new batch, but its limited, really only enough to fill one plate full if you just ate that alone... My friend asked for water, and the server brought us the bill (one bill with service charge of 10%). I thought usually it only applies to 6 or more ppl, but its not that significant, so its fine... Server being not busy, but not really proactive in clearing plates from tables...  This is a place to definitely avoid, unless you're okay with spending under $17 pp and having limited quantity amount to fill yourself up on."}
{"text":"Just like another yelper, my parents also insisted trying this place out due to an ad in a chinese newspaper. Paid $11.99/person on New Year's Day! Once my parents and I were seated, the waitress kept pressuring us to start eating twice even though our other guests have yet to arrive - I couldn't understand the reason why she would tell us that. The restaurant overall wasn't super busy either. The atmosphere was quite poor. The floors were sticky. We were sat in the middle with booths. Oddly, the booth seating felt like I was sitting on a park bench. The seat was half the size of normal chairs!! It was quite uncomfortable. As for a previous yelper showed those torn, cracking old chairs, they still have the same chairs!! They just covered them with a new seating cushion.   As for the food, the selection was small in comparison to most buffets. They had the usual, sweet & sour pork, lemon chicken, mixed veggies, chow mein, fried rice and etc. Their sushi wasn't the greatest - mushy & too much rice, which is quite sad since their name is basically sushi. The dessert was still frozen when I tried their lemon tart pie? (I'm assuming since there was no label at all for it) Also, be careful of their dipped drainage on the floor, I almost tripped on that twice!   The classical saying, 'you get what you pay for' should be their slogan!! This will definitely be my first &a last visit."}
{"text":"Where to start. I hate writing bad about places but this place is just beyond horrible. No one deserves to eat here even if it is for 10 bucks. I came here once before when it was Panda buffet. The food was horrible and i vowed never to come here.   Afterwards , when they changed to Dragon Handroll , my stupid brain thought maybe the food might have gotten better. Nope! Just as horrible as always. Flavorless, too much salt, cold and disgusting. I mean when the only thing the person liked in the buffet was the fruit, there is something wrong for sure. The sushi was gross, and we literally left after 10 minutes. Could not even chew on anything. Please skip this place if you are even thinking of it. It will save you 10 bucks and a lot more pain and suffering.  Cheers."}
{"text":"We went there all the way from North York and a small crowd standing outside on a Saturday evening. Apparently the place is closed...not sure if it was closed for the day or closed forever."}
{"text":"Do not eat at this place. Found a cockroach in my food. He tried to make me pay still and we told him no way and left. The manager acted like it was no big deal. Brimley and egliton"}
{"text":"Parents insisted we come here when they saw the newspaper advertisement for $11.99 per person. Food was quite terrible and everything was drowned in either sauce or oil. Best item here hands down is the ice cream but it's the generic ice cream found at sushi buffets anyways. I would recommend others to go to a McDonald's for a better meal in terms of cost and taste."}
{"text":"Located right at the northwest corner of Brimley and Eglinton, this is an easily accessible location with plenty of parking, so that kind of explains the popularity. Food is plentiful and inexpensive, but this is mall food court quality food at best. If that's all you're looking for, fine, you can fill up and enjoy. But people looking for quality sushi need to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decided to try come back to this place for the first time in YEARS. I came on a Thursday night with a party of 5 and the place only had a few tables filled. The buffet price is a lot cheaper compared to other places, but that comes with a smaller selection. The food was okay, they had a decent selection of salad, fruits, cake, ice cream, sushi (don't try it it is not fresh at all), fried food, and Chinese main dishes. I recommend the chow mein noodles and the oysters.   The service was actually pretty attentive, they were always clearing our dishes and refilling our water, so that is definitely something to appreciate. Would I come here again? Maybe but I'll agree with the rest of the reviewers that you do get what you paid for, which is a cheaper quality than average buffet at a cheap price."}
{"text":"So many things were wrong: - Fish still tasted frozen - Sushi is tiny and mostly rice  - Fried fish was too salty  - Noodles were too soft/soggy - Ginger for sushi was very acetic  - Chicken wings were too soggy  - Chicken balls were too tough - Soup and salad tasted funny  - Limited variety  - Ran out of most food at 7:30pm (maybe earlier) when it closes at 10pm - Lack of service  - The list goes on .....   What can you expect when dinner buffet price is $9.99 (Tuesday only). I wanted to give this place more than 1 star, considering the price, but I just can't.  Like walking out of a strip club (Caddy's is across the street), I was ashamed I went here LOL"}
{"text":"Was going to go for dim sum. Saw an advertisement for this in the Chinese newspaper. Was in Chinese. I don't read Chinese. Name of the restaurant was in English. I saw prices. Asked my mother to translate. Turns out Mon to Thurs lunch buffet is $7.99 until the end of November. We went last Thursday. Tables and chairs are a tad dilapidated, but I've seen and sat at worse.   Food is Canadian Chinese, with a side of sushi. For the price, the food is definitely not bad. I didn't have anything below average. Items above average included their char siu (better than some legit Chinese bbq placed), their fried shrimp (not tempura), their tofu flower, their fruits, and their tirimisu cake (super fluffy cake and distinct coffee flavor). Sushi had a tad too much rice, but for $7.99, I really can't complain. This is a definite cheap eat, and I'd go again."}
{"text":"Parent insisted on trying this place out bc of the great prices they had in the newspaper. Dear god I thought buffets like this went out in the last decade. If you like mediocrely cooked carbs, this is the place for you.  You'd think any place with Roll in the title should have decent rolls right? Nope! Should call them rice balls, the filling (cucumber mostly) is minuscule. Not much selection to be had, and a lot of it was cooked with old oil.  Place was pretty full, which I can only reason as they too were duped by parents who also saw the same advert (confirmed, as we saw an acquaintance who came for the same reason).  The only things that are good were the noodles and veg, as those were replenished more often. Mango salad was good too.  Decor is bad too. Chair cushions are all seamed and cracked as well as being so heavy that I almost pulled a muscle. Furniture evidently came with the place, as the name of the old restaurant Happy Panda was on the tables and receipt.  The only reason I gave it two stars is bc it's clearly a case of getting what you paid"}
{"text":"I get that this place is super cheap for buffets prices, I mean $10 for dinner wow! However, the food was terrible. Although we arrived as soon as dinner started the food was old, reheated and just gross. The salad bar was a sad scene with head lettuce and 2 types of dressing and a few slices cucumber. Dessert was a few cookies and a smashed up quarter piece of cheesecake. Some of the food (basa in special sauce) actually tasted rotten and I had to immediately spit it out. You usually get what you pay for but in this instance I feel thoroughly ripped off."}
{"text":"Dragon Handroll is really as bad as everyone says. I'm not going to reiterate what was already said about the food, but the service was actually okay. And hey, it's only $11 for an all you can eat dinner; you get what you paid for. However, if you decide to swing by this buffet for a meal, I suggest to steer clear of the sushi and to try the green tea ice cream. Parking is ample and this restaurant is located at the intersection of two bus routes, so no worries on that front."}
{"text":"I live one block from this restaurant and decided to try takeout.  I wanted a combo plate of General Tao chicken.  They wouldn't do a combo plate.  Only option is to buy an order of General Chicken and Pork fried rice for $16.  A good restaurant would have done a combo plate and maybe charged a dollar or two more for the substitution.  I walked out and went to the wing place across the street.  I found another Chinese restaurant that does a combo plate of General Taos chicken and they also deliver.  I will never step foot in this neighbourhood restaurant again."}
{"text":"Gawd awful. Chicken balls were tough. Selection sparse. Serve room temp water. AWFUL!!!!   I rarely leave a restaurant without tipping. Service was awful and food awful, so NO TIP FOR YOU!!!"}
{"text":"this place is the old panda buffet but worse.. they got rid of the soups and tofu dessert.. in place of the most ghetto sushi section ever.    the rolls they kept pushing out were really bad rolls with little to no salmon or fish... mad stinge to the max.  and they were putting the seaweed salad in the rolls with mayonaise all over the top.  just wierd creations that didnt work..  my water was empty for the longest time.  if you want to see a sad buffet that is holding on by a thread, this is the place to go.    its all bad quality chinese food and everything is fried."}
{"text":"I was expecting what I was coming for but wanted to give a second chance to that restaurant. Don't know how they respect the customer with the poor quality of foods they have and the poor choice.  The food is tasteless and cold not warmed enough as much as poor selection and quantity of food in display.  Before i went I called and was told that the price was a promotion but find out it is the regular price posted on the window and they had shrimps but someone had to insist to have the shrimps as they were not present at our arrival and when they put in the tray it is so little that it feeds only one or two persons.  A customer was complaining that the stuff in the trays was leftover from the lunch and so did it appear as the food was luke warm even if it was 6 PM. The restaurant is empty and one or two customers come at the time. The ice cream is either very soft or hard like a rock and can not be pulled from the container, the spoons are cheap and they even have plastic one in the tray for the dessert. The quantity of choice in dessert is limited to 3 kind of cake and out dated fruit. The restroom is dirty and the seat is loose floor are wet and not clean in the restaurant the chairs are heave and even if stated new management it is the same old staff and the same decor that is not inviting anymore unless you are desperate to eat fast and cheap. No value for the price as per quality of food and service. There is no \"dim sum\" and limited quantity of food. Staff come in and interrupt customer to take food while searching for take out on the display."}
