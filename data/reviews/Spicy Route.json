{"text":"This place is Spicy Route, but changed the name to Congee Mee! However when we checked out this place, its still Spicy Route but now they're offering congee. The place has nice comfy booths and its open til 5AM!

We ordered two steamed buns with meat for .99 cents each. Its tasty and flavourful, the kind you buy at the chinese supermarket...

We also ordered the beef pancake which is very flavourful, however, its not worth $4 for just two half pieces.

We got the Yeung Chow Fried Rice for $7 which is alright, but the portion is not that big.

We got the braised meatball with fungus and brown sauce ($7). Its tender and tasty, but again the portion is quite small. Overall experience, this place is alright, might pop by when there's not much option late at night."}
{"text":"Terrible food and Terrible customer service!

When you enter some joints in Scarborough, at some level you make a deal that for generally good food and affordable prices, you'll put up with the customer service. This review is not that story. This place took the cake for customer service to say the least!

We ordered Szechuan noodles, specifically said \"vegetarian, no meat\". What did we get? The noodles with meat. When alerted to our server, the response: \"Just take it off!\"  Doesn't stop there, after we protest and request a new veggie noodles, we receive the same plate with the meat picked off. How do we know?  We dug deeper and found meat pieces in the middle and bottom. 

Mind you, this is Christmas Eve and our usual trustworthy spot Perfect was packed with a lineup, so the options to pick up and leave were sorely limited. 

Next up: Tofu. We ordered Fried Tofu and pointed to the picture to confirm we're all on the same page (pun intended). What do we get? Some soggy tofu, definitely not fried, swimming in an incredibly oily gravy. We alert this to the same server and she tells us point blank to our face that it is deep fried. At this point, we give up due to hunger and decide to deal with the food. 

I also ordered an eggplant dish and my buddy ordered a hot pot shrimp. The eggplant was okay at best (6/10). My friend rated the taste of the shrimp as a 3/10 and complained there was way too much shell. 

Asking for water and hot sauce was a big mission as they were very much understaffed and responded with annoyance. 

Based on our experience and quality of food, I would NEVER recommend this place."}

Spice Route will be a perfect restaurant if you want a pick me up or drunk food in the middle of the night.... Spicy enough to wake up your organs and your senses!

The interior of the restaurant is clean and modern since it did a complete renovation and there is not a hint of the previous Vietnamese restaurant at all.

Spicy Duck Heads in a Hot Pot?! I don't think I can handle that alone but that does sound promising....

Crispy Bamboo Shoot ($12.99) was so light with just a touch of spiciness would be perfect with some beers. Deep fried then stir fried in house special sauce would definitely wake up your senses...

Noodle with Green Pepper and Pork ($7.50) in a gluey sauce was a little too heavy for my taste. The noodle though was chewy and has a great bite. 

Waitress is super friendly and I think I am ready to come back to eat the spiciness item in the menu: Stewed Spicy Duck! And of course a side order of Iced water for my Yelp friend too!"}
