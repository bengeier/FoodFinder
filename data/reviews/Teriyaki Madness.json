{"text":"Great fast food restaurant large portions. The food is good taste and great bargains. The service is good the restaurant is clean. I had the Teriyaki hot chicken with rice and steam vegetables. Had enough food for two meals would recommend this restaurant for familes"}
{"text":"I was on hold for 7 minutes before the girl answered my can you hold call, my husband went to go pick up my food that I was still on hold to order & he says she was laughing and talking with a guy while I was on hold!!!!  Food is great but customer service sucks! Hire some people with class"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS! The customer service and staff including the manager need to be replaced immediately! I purchased a groupon for two bowls for 7.99. I call in the order over the phone AND notified the girl that answered that I will be using a groupon- she said that's fine just present at the register at pick up. Upon picking up my order the girl now doesn't know how to ring it up so her coworker says oh we don't accept groupon. I said well isn't that something that should have been Disclosed when I placed my order and stated I had a groupon? His attitude was horrible - he didn't care if I left the food do to their mistake. I figured I was dealing with people that did not have basic education so I requested the manager. Well not to my surprise, he was even worse. He said all I can do is charge you for two drinks and give you one bowl free. The math came out to me paying double  what I would have originally. I paid for the two drinks and didn't even take the cups, it's the principle. I will never, nor my family, and I will inform co workers to not go here. This place is not worth my money. I suggest they offer courses in customer service to their employees."}
{"text":"Two stars cause the salad was crisp. The chicken was terrible. They should use a higher quality of meat. The service was horrible. Somebody please tell me where i can get a good chicken bowl"}
{"text":"the service was good, I'll give this place that but the food YUCK! I ordered the chicken breast teriyaki and it tasted like cardboard, worse that a frozen entree, the salad was wilted and frozen. Will not go back"}
{"text":"Very slow....  ice machine was still down, sold me a drink... i was okay with no ice... then was told ice machine was down... paid for soda but ended up with bottled water... 30 minutes for chicken teryaki... wasnt that busy either... light lunch rush"}
{"text":"I had such a bad experience here! The girl at the register was so rude! I came in about 11am and it wasn't too busy and the girl at the front was so short amd not helpful at all!! The food was good but i will never return to this location while that girl is working there!  If you want good service don't go here!!! Two stars are for the food."}
{"text":"Ok, I've tried some of the other \"teriyaki\" mom and pop places in town....and by far...TMAD is the best! Get the Most portions for your money don't waste your money on those other places! You actually get alot of chicken versus massive mound of rice.Great salad dressing, always fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"so delicious! i absolutely love this place!!!!!! i recommend their white rice with orange chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered the orange chicken to find out the chicken was raw!!!   Made zero effort to rectify the situation.  I just hope i don't get food poisoning, will contact clark county health department."}
{"text":"Me and my honey went to try this place and I got chicken Teriyaki with vegetables and white rice and she got the katsu chicken and white rice and everything was really fresh and good. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken breast teriyaki and chicken tested old and very dry. I will never come back again."}
{"text":"It's incredible how much you miss a place after you move, I worked at T-mad for almost a year and I can honestly say, there is no other place like there. I ate Teriyaki Madness EVERYDAY, even on my days off I'd go in for a bite to eat.  After I moved back to Tucson, I realized there is NOTHING out here that compares to my spicy breast bowl with white rice and eggs. After spending so much time in one place it sort of becomes a second home. I was able to get a group of my friends in there and they instantly fell in love with the place. Even one of my friends who came to visit was excited to walk back in to the T-mad atmosphere. From the yakisoba noodles to the eggrolls, everything is delicious. Coming from someone who ate there everyday, take my advice.   Every place has their flaws. No food restaurant can be perfect, but if you take the good with the bad, it eventually becomes the best.  I cant wait for the day I can go back to Vegas and get my fill of the Madness."}
{"text":"Great teriyaki, as always. Customer service was ok. Location was great as it's in a plaza with other establishments."}
{"text":"I love it! I just wanted to make a note the bowls are microwavable!!! lol. I know that seems irrelevant to a lot of people but it is really useful when re warming food and you can re use the container over and over."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. We saw the billboards and love teriyaki so we decided to give it a try. Food was fresh and tasty. Had the spicy chicken bowl and potstickers and an egg roll. Everything was perfectly cooked and crispy."}
{"text":"Great portions , fresh food , amazing customer service ! Very convenient parking and great area one of my favorite spots"}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere!  The spicy chicken and veggies were amazing.  The place was very clean and staff was friendly.  My new favorite place to go for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Teriyaki Chicken in AZ!  Love it!  I had the chicken teriyaki with white rice and veggies.  Chicken was cooked perfect and piping hot.  There was more than enough food for the price.  The atmosphere is cozy and staff was very friendly.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I come here often due to the fact that I work and live nearby. Customer service is always outstanding! Plus, the food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Yum! My new favorite place to eat in vegas. As a vegetarian, it's not easy to find quick and healthy meals. Teriyaki madness has the answer to that. I always order a tofu bowl with all veggies, no rice so I have no idea if the rice is good or not. It is always super hot and very flavorful. We have never waited more then 10 minutes for our food either. The edamame is good too, hot and salty. My hubby loves the chicken teriyaki. The prices are pretty good, not cheap but fair. Just under $20 for two entrees and two drinks. We eat here at least once a week, if not more frequently."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, nice clean and warm eating area. Food is very flavorful with very big portions. There's a sign that says, \"WARNING! FOOD IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!\" And they aren't lying. Great spot."}
{"text":"Everything here is the bomb! You can never go wrong with whatever you get, and the menu ranges from everything healthy to the other end of the spectrum, and that's a good thing! Seriously! I'm serious by the fact that you can NEVER GO WRONG WITH WHAT YOU GET! The staff is very friendly too, very helpful and respectful :) respect comes with respect. Overall, great atmosphere to be in, would rate this 10/5 if I could. Been coming here for six years and won't ever stop"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a couple times. both of which have been a good experience and the food is delicious!! The cashier by the name of Raeanne has taken our order each of the times we have visited and is always helpful and friendly. The first time we went she made sure to explain the way their menu worked; what we could pick, choose, combine, etc which is always a plus when visiting a new restaurant. She treats you like you have been friends for years and makes sure you leave with a good impression of the restaurant. The place is super clean and the rest of the team here are great! I will definitely become a regular customer and if you have never been there it's very well worth a try!!"}
{"text":"Easy review, I get the same thing every time. A chicken teriyaki plate with white rice and green salad. Bang for the buck you cannot beat the value! Delicious chicken, fresh salad, and white rice. Every now and then I add the noodles, they're so good! What's not to love!  Have been going to this location at Warm Springs and Durango for over five Year's. Worst thing that's ever happened is they forgot my salad one time and made up for it when I came back. My favorite things about this place are the value, consistency, and taste!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service was horrible. After paying for my pick up order, the cashier told me that my order will be out shortly. I ended up waiting for 10 minutes before the cashier thought about asking for my name was again. She asked me if my name was Kimberly (even though I'm a guy), and when I told her my name, she gave me one of the other two bags that were sitting on the counter. My bag was sitting on the counter for at least 7 minutes, and she never even once called out the name of the order.  She also didn't apologize. This employee was so incompetent and unprofessional. I've never had this problem at the Wigwam location..."}
{"text":"This place is legit! The food has great taste, clean, fresh ingredients, and the staff are friendly and service with a smile. I will always be back to eat here."}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: Fresh ingredients. Healthy options. Loads of flavor!  I am thoroughly impressed by Teriyaki Madness. The prices are reasonable and the dishes are fresh and flavorful. Options can range from healthy (veggies and brown rice) to less so depending on your mood. Oh, the edamame is a nice touch too."}
{"text":"Really don't appreciate ordering take away, getting back to my office & the chicken looked off & wasn't even heated properly!    This isn't a situation where my meal cooled because of the drive.   This is a situation where the chicken strips in my Chicken Breast bowl were ICE COLD!  Like defrosted, but looked heated but tasted cold like an ice cube.   Never going back. Whole Foods is the same price and it's cooked fresh. Unlike this place ... who apparently uses a microwave to heat frozen chicken out of a bag bought from Costco's frozen section!!!!   It not only looked like frozen microwaved chicken (dry & stringy), the pieces of the chicken strip that weren't frozen & actually heated tasted dry.   I'm saying heated instead of cooked. You don't COOK food in a microwave. You heat or defrost food in a microwave. Huge difference.   If you want FRESH FOOD, you won't get it here."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Teriyaki Madness the other day. It was reasonably fast, restaurant was very clean, Portion was decent. Price a little high for me but compared to Mcdonalds, burger king, taco bell, etc you get a much better bang for your buck, and much healthier than the other fast food places."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite fast food places in town. I very rarely eat out at fast food places but I'd get the spicy chicken plate probably once a week. They recently changed their menu, and what that really meant is they lowered their portions and raised their prices. Instead of the plate they offer the large bowl, and I'd roughly estimate it having about 50-65% of the chicken that the plate had; they mix in vegetables instead of putting them on the side to in order to make the bowl appear full. Not to mention they now charge $1 extra for the mac salad side. While taste is subjective I would also say it doesn't taste quite the same as it used to. In summation, while I used to be a regular, after my last experience I won't be going back."}
{"text":"First time to this location. Clean area, good food and great service!! The manager was great and helpful! We are so glad there is a convenient place for us to eat now! Thanks again Dean!!!!"}
{"text":"I love their chicken. This is one of my daughters favs. It's simple and fresh and their sauce is great. Sometimes I combo up half spicy chicken/regular chicken. No matter what I've never been disappointed with Teriyaki Madness. Now their bowls come with the veggies. Yay!! So happy to see them expanding. They are waayyyy better than Ur average panda express."}
{"text":"I love the chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice and veggies! It is so delicious and they were fast to make it. My fiancé got the spicy chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies. He prefers no rice usually, so they add more meat and veggies which tastes really good!! But overall you can't go wrong with whatever you choose it's mouth watering, tasteful, and satisfying."}
{"text":"Best Teriyaki in Mesa. Tell me a better place and I'll give it a try. Fresh and just good."}
{"text":"Walked into a quite busy environment but was able to order and receive my food in a timely fashion. Food was cooked to perfection and I strongly suggest the spicy chicken , noodles and veggies ."}
{"text":"i ordered 1 orange chicken kids bowl, 1 katsu chicken bowl, and 1 spicy chicken bowl. i told the cashier that my kids will share their orange chicken kids bowl. i also asked if the kids bowl came with a kids drink. the cashier answered yes. i paid with cash and a receipt was not given to me. when the food was brought out, there was no kids drink and all three bowls were regular size. i told the cashier that i ordered an orange chicken kids bowl. he answered i thought you ordered a regular bowl. i told the cashier that i said my toddlers will share the kids bowl and does it come with a drink and you answered yes. a manager/ owner came out to the front at this time. the cashier told him that the order was taken wrong. then the manager/ owner went back to the kitchen. the cashier told me that yes you can have a drink but it will be $2.15. so the cashier put in the wrong order and when i addressed the issue with him, he didn't try to fix the issue but instead told me to pay for a drink that was supposed to come with the kids bowl that i ordered. funny."}
{"text":"I've been to other Teriyaki Madness locations and they all have excellent customer service, but Heather at this location gave us the best customer service I've ever had at any of their locations. She was so patient and polite and always had a smile on her face:) I was so impressed with her attitude, I asked her for her name so I could write this review! Thank you Heather! I hope you read this and continue to demonstrate that positive attitude, it was definitely noticed and appreciated by us:)"}
{"text":"Freaking bomb ass place! Love their trademark teriyaki sauce!! Their bowls are kind of pricey, but they do give you a great amount of food. Their plates are nice too. Their teriyaki chicken is the best for me because the beef one isn't as juicy, but nonetheless, still good   The only thing that bothers me is that the staff can sometimes be so \"eh\". They sometimes look like they don't want to be there. Most of the time, staff service is great, but I go here frequently and they need to change that flat attitude towards customers. It is just too obvious that some of them are really bored and can't think of anything to pass the time quicker.. Overall, the food makes up for their lack of enthusiasm lol."}
{"text":"Soooooo much better than any Samurai Sam's that's for sure. The chicken is actually grilled, and they give you tons of veggies and extra sauce which I really appreciate since that is not standard. I called, put my order in and drove up 10 minutes later greeted by a really friendly guy who took care of me lickety split."}
{"text":"Just arrived home with my two bowls. One with rice and veggies and one low carb option that is supposed to be all veggies. The low carb bowl barely had a spoonful of veggies. You can literally see the bottom of the container! Had high hopes for this place.....not anymore!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Clean place and good food! Better than Panda! Not dry at all, chicken was soft, and tender and tasted delicious! I'm a pretty picky eater, so that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"hands down prefer this location than any other location , it's conveniently located in front of LVAC post work out meal for sure . the food was filled with so much flavor , I usually don't get the spicy chicken teriyaki since its always dry & today it was really delicious so juicy . the salmon oh my goodness was so good . I recommend this place !!!!!"}
{"text":"Out of all the teriyaki joints this one is OK.  I usually order the chicken combination. It comes with the following; Grilled Chicken, Rice, Small salad...Vegetables is offered at a additional The chicken is decent with a good sauce. They have a bunch of Siracha sauce for your use. The rice at times can be a little on the sticky side, but the it's not too bad. The Vegetables is usually on the a bit of the bland side, but what can you do?  Over all it's not a bad joint, I would go back there, but too bad they're not open late night?"}
{"text":"Come here for the orange chicken. Food is great, location is great.  The amount of tables inside have them ready for a lot of people to eat in, but there never seems to be a lot of people to stay and eat.  It's a fairly new place to this side of town(that I know of) but I def come here to eat than panda."}
{"text":"Good customer service and good food. I have the low carb meal on occasion. It's affordable, convenient and somewhat low-calorie ( in comparison to other fast food places).  The main thing that sells me about this place, is that the staff is always friendly and ready to take care of your order. Simple and convenient...I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest place to eat. The staff doesn't smile or welcome you in. There is a awkward silence in the store that I would not want to stay and eat in. Ugh! The male employee taking orders was wearing his uniform shirt with holes in it."}
{"text":"I went there this evening for the first time and the food, as well as the customer service is outstanding. The young girl who waited on me was welcoming and explained the menu. They even gave me 5% off since it was my first time. I will certainly return!"}
{"text":"I have a restaurant background, so I'm usually pretty accepting of hiccups. But I will never step foot in this place again. My co-workers eat here so I gave it a go. I can't even discuss the food because after waiting about 25 minutes I asked for a refund. That amount of time in a fast casual restaurant is abhorrent. The place was a dump. Even if they had a really busy lunch, I could see sweeping was not a regular duty there. Which makes me wonder what else they're neglecting. There was one person ahead of me in line, but several others waiting. They were talking, asking how long the other had waited. When some guy said 40 minutes, I decided to ask for my money back. The gal didn't know how, and didn't seem to want to ask a manager. When she finally did, the manager was totally emotionless. If at least she offered a sincere concern I might have returned. Staff looked miserable and low energy, not one smile. So i walked next door to JJ and every single person lit up, said hello and I had food literally within a minute. First time at both places and we know which one I'll return to. Not a good way to run a business."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss. Got a great teriyaki bowl last week and this week decided to grab a teriyaki plate and this time the chicken seems really old and dried out. The sauce is good but maybe that helps moisten up the chicken but didn't want a whole lot of sauce on it. Maybe next time will be good and will have to give it another shot"}
{"text":"Once again this location disappoints.  Tonight they refused my order through Postmates,  that is the 2nd time this week. The order comes back with a message \"we are too busy to complete your order\", I ordered 1 bowl. What? Isn't that your business? Additionally,  last week I tried to order while coming home from the hockey game and the woman taking my order had no idea what she was doing. She did not understand their own menu?! The food is fine but the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Usually I am a regular customer at the Craig location (closer to base) Although I work on centennial therefore I come to this location for lunch often. I am very picky eater and with that being said I know how to order my food to my liking. I order the same thing every time I go and they get it correctly everytime. This time when I checked food they did not which is not a big deal. I simply told the cashier I asked for my rice with no veggies and instead of apologizing and fixing it she argued with me telling me I didnt not order it that way. Which is quite upsetting when I spend money at a establishment I expect to get what I want. Mean while who I am assuming was the manager was standing there listening to this whole conversation (he didnt not address who he was) came to me a told me in the future I need to order things correctly and this wont happen anymore. Basicly still telling me I am a liar and dont know how to order my own food. This location is clean and food its self was good like always, although the customer service was infurating. I will not come back to this location for that reason. I prefer not be called a liar by people who are taking my money. They clearly think they have plenty of buisness and dont need to be remotely kind to earn any repeat customers therefore I am sure they will be just fine without my buisness."}
{"text":"First, I'm starting to realize that I only review places that I really really love. Topping that list, Teriyaki Madness. That whole \"highly addictive food\" statement is dangerously true.  I'm ashamed to say that I get the exact same thing every time I come, which is usually more than once a week. My husband at least switches it up. But I am totally completely satisfied with the same thing every single visit.  Of course I'm talking about the spicy chicken bowl. Which is spicy perfection in a rice filled bowl. The chicken is always expertly cooked and grilled beautifully, extra sauce is served on the side (I always use 2 containers full), and the staff is always sweet and helpful. I go with no veggies and white rice, but you can healthy it up by adding veggies and requesting brown rice. I've never gotten a bad bowl, in fact what impresses me the most is the fact that the food is consistently fantastic.  Just be warned... It really is addictive. If this is addiction, I don't ever want to go to rehab!"}
{"text":"one of the best places for  vegetarian food. the workers were nice and food was made fast. also gave a discount for yelp check ins. 0"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place for the first time last night and we found the food to be decent. The service on our first time was awkwardly long, it took over fifteen to twenty minutes to get our food, and there wasn't that many people there. Overall, it wasn't bad, but we don't have a pressing desire or inclination to return. The cost of the food was relative and reasonable. I give it a 5/10."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great friendly inviting staff, always pleasant and smiling and the dinner area is always clean.   All the menu items are great.  Most favorite for our family is the chicken and beef.  Fresh vegetables and fresh salad...and a bottle of sauce to go. Keeps everyone satisfied and happy!"}
{"text":"The perfect place when you don't feel like cooking but don't want unhealthy fast food. This is real food, lean and delicious.  Spicy chicken and chicken katsu are our favorites always with brown rice and extra veggies. Good food that is fast but not processed."}
{"text":"Chicken plate was good but the beef plate was a little dry.  Service was excellent and the veggies were good.  Teriyaki sauce was a little too sweet for me."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I love this style food but my kids were skeptical. However even my kids were impressed with the bowls we ordered. Customer service was more than accommodating and the place was so clean. Again this is not the norm at local shops like this. You won't be disappointed I can promise you that."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Poke express but found out the place was closed and then went to 808 and wow closed too.. Guess they was on Hawaiian time? So decided to try this place.. It was ok.. Ordered the combo spicy chicken and orange chicken and for the price they charge it wasn't worth it! The portions there was disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent moist, spicy teriyaki chicken, crunchy veggies, decently priced, polite staff. Always ask for extra teriyaki & soy sauce. Very clean when I was there last night at 2030. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Place is good in a pinch! it's close and fast!!! I like the orange chicken, there teriyaki beef is like beef jerkey! it must sit in a five gallon bucket in the back. marinating for day's !!! to much shoyu !!! and the salads are just lettuce!!! wth? if you order a plate, it does not include any veggies!!!  so, good cause it's close~ and thats it!!!"}
{"text":"Will defiantly come back!!! the food was well prepared and came out reasonably fast for how busy it was during dinner time, the front cashier was very helpful when it came to answering all my questions, the place was very clean and smelling fresh! love having such a big portion of food that's tasty and reasonably priced try it out!! you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious and the best food!  We have to go every week, because we love the sauces and the teriyaki chicken bowls.  Great service and consistent every time!  We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, a lot of seating, fast service  Short drive, very pleased"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while even tho 24hr is my gym. Had the chicken breast bowl. Was disappointed when I got home to find the chicken breast very under cooked. Wish I hadn't tipped."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place but I feel like every time I go in they mess up my order. Really feel like they're going downhill.  Too bad :("}
{"text":"I've become a Teriyaki Madness fan! I initially found TM for my husband since he loves chicken teriyaki. I can't get enough of this stuff!!!!  I usually get the chicken teriyaki bowl with white rice and veggies. They give you a very generous portion of veggies and chicken. Flavorful and tasty! I've also tried the gyoza and shrimp tempura - both also very good.  My husband likes the macaroni salad. Although he wishes they would give a bigger portion of it. He's also tried one of their plate dishes. He had to take the leftovers home.  Very good price for the portion they give. Friendly staff. One of my favorite places to go to."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good teriyaki, look elsewhere. Horrific experience with the staff as they forgot to place my order to-go. After 30 minutes of waiting, I spoke up because I had to leave for an appointment. Re-placed my order and was handed my bag, they forgot to include my macaroni salad as well as the chicken breast. I didn't have enough time to ask them again to correct my order. Will never come back and will never recommend. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Man. I wanted so badly to support this small business. There were about three customers ahead of us, and over the course of 30 whole minutes waiting, the line of customers increased to about 10, including a table full of policemen. OMG we waited F O R E V E R for our food. The menu is simple. Really. Why was the wait so stinking long? There were a few girls up front that looked genuinely sad to be there, and the owner (I presume) would come out and ask who had what occasionally. All that wait, and we got bowls that were about 75% rice. The actual teriyaki sauce is tasty with the chicken, but you get so little of the meat that it's just not worth it. The price is not okay for what we got, about $9 a meal. Also, my husband's bowl had a long hair in it! We will stick to Panda and the like for fast teriyaki bowls in the neighborhood. Sorry to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Best in town in my humble opinion.  All the employees are engaging and highly affable.  A.J., one of their employees is there standout!   Their customer service alone is the greatest reason why I consistently continue to come back and why I completely stopped going to Samurai's and Tokyo.  Not to mention the quality and taste of the food."}
{"text":"Food was nice. Simple but tasty (though I think the teriyaki tofu could maybe use a little revamping). Anyway, totally fine. The one issue was we were there with kids and the TV was showing UFC the entire time. If a place is trying to be a family establishment (and they had entrees for kids, so clearly they are on some level), people beating eachother bloody isn't really appropriate for the one dining area."}
{"text":"Yummmmmy. The spicy chicken is by far the BEST. Food is never over/under cooked or chewy, always taste fresh.   Would give it 5 stars but I often have quite the wait when im there."}
{"text":"I love this place for a quick meal on the go or sit down and enjoy. My favorite is the spicy teriyaki bowl with the noodles. So much flavor! They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"WOW! A fellow Yelper recommended this place to me and boy am I now infected with the \"Madness\"! I ordered the chicken teriyaki plate with white rice and macaroni salad. I absolutely love crab rangoons so I added the 4 piece rangoons to my order. The teriyaki sauce is to die for! Its not too sweet and but savory. Not only do they put it on your chicken, you get an extra mini cup to add more. The crab rangoons were huge and chockful of creamy crab filling! The tastiest I've ever had.  I've become so addicted that I plan to go once a week there for my teriyaki fix (even though its a bit out there for me). I'm happy I gave into peer pressure this time!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I usually call my order in, so I don't have to wait cause good food takes time people.  Great customer service, very nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"Did this place change owners &/or remodel? We came here 2yrs ago when the walls had pictures all over. Got pissed they offered noodles or rice? & got charged extra without knowing- said we would not return- 2yrs later we are starving.. 808 is closed- were like ok one more chance-.. Enter new looking place only red/black everywhere remains.. Order with kid who is high(literally). Order beef w noodles & only broccoli .. Instead of charging me a yakisoba order= beef+noodles+veg=7.69 we get charged a 6.79 beef bowl+1.00 noodles + 1.00 broccoli=$8.79 I ask what's the difference after I start reviewing the menu after paying he says oh the yakisoba is a plate w MORE food(@$1.00 less!!) omfg. I got spicy chicken bowl+.50 for brown rice.. Anyway it's so freakin spicy the chicken is all dry like sawdust & charcoal had a baby & there's no flavor just burning my mouth hot - never never again not even starving. WHY CAN'T SAMURAI SAMS BE IN NORTH TOWN !!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Sadly, the staff already know us by name because we come here so much and order the same thing every time. Mild spicy teriyaki chicken is the best. We get our son a kids chicken bowl and a couple sides of yummy stir fried veggies.  They have amazing Mac salad -wish it was more! The food truly tastes clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Loved their teriyaki chicken bowl. Ask for fried rice and with vegetables.  It's stirfried and totally fresh. The taste was awesome. They give you a lot of chicken. It's not fried but freshly grilled. Sauce was really good.  Must try!"}
{"text":"Love the service and absolutely adore the food had such a great experience. Its really nice to see the owner pushing food and interacting with customers leading by example letting you know your business matters YOU GO BOYZZ!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had excellent meals at another location, so I stopped by this location recently when I was nearby. The order takers were young and looked bored/unenthused. Loud and at times offensive dance music was being played through the house speakers. When an order was ready, the server didn't have a very loud voice and often looked frustrated that nobody could hear her call out the names.  When my food finally arrived (the spicy chicken plate) the chicken had been overcooked and spiced unevenly. The noodles were good, and so were the vegetables -- still a good value for your money considering the quantity of food -- but this is not the place to have a quality relaxing meal. Overall it reminded me of a high school cafeteria with dance music. I will eat at the other location if I want this food again."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered two entrees and two egg rolls to go at this location. When we got home and bit into the egg rolls we discovered they tasted bad, like chemicals, and we couldn't eat them. We went with bad rolls in hand to get our money back for the defective food and was informed they do not give refunds. The cashier said she was not allowed to give money back and would have to call the manager. The manager then said the same thing, no refunds. While they offered two new egg rolls we did not want them because we feared they would taste the same and we were turned off eating them by how bad the first ones were. When we stated we did not want replacement food but just our money back they said there was nothing they could do for us and then effectively ignored us. It's not about the four dollars lost, it's about the rudeness and lack of customer service. When something is inedible you should be able to return the product and get your money back, not have to accept something that could still taste badly so you no longer want it. Will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Food was quick and tasty. I had the spicy teriyaki chicken and katsu chicken. It was well seasoned and not too try overall very good !"}
{"text":"Highly generic but surprisingly good.  I got the teriyaki chicken with extra vegetables and the bill came to $7.77.  Food that one can get hooked to."}
{"text":"Food was ok, the girl at the register was RUDE!!! For the price of the food and the location of this place I would think they would be a little nicer!"}
{"text":"Terrible paid my order and he just gets on the phone doesn't even hand me m y stuff or say thanks terrible customer service"}
{"text":"The best TM in town! The staff is always friendly and food is amazing! Shout out to AJ tonight!"}
{"text":"We enjoy this establishment for the great service, quality food and friendly employees. They also offer great coupon deals for those on a budget. This place is on our list of go to's when we can't think of something new to try. It's always a no brainer when you want something good and close to home. My favorite like many others is the spicy chicken/BBQ beef plate with brown rice Yum!"}
{"text":"I had ordered a bowl of pork.  The meat was cooked to perfection, and filled half the plate.  The other half was carbohydrates (rice).  I will be nice to get a greater proportion of meat than rice."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this restaurant. The place was clean, the employees were friendly and the location is great. The food was just okay in my opinion.  I paid about $30 for two meals and the portions were small. The salad was pretty boring, small and consisted of nothing but iceberg lettuce. If you want fast food Asian style cuisine, I suggest to go to another restaurant."}
{"text":"The girl at the counter was super friendly and she repeated it all back to me since I was buying my staff lunch confirming everyone's details were correct!!! I would say the 2 stars are for her cause she was great. Sadly the food was disappointing so bad I didn't even eat mine. I asked my employees if their food was ok and they gave me a shoulder shrug and it's ok (we all know that's code for not good but they didn't want to hurt my feelings) I ordered the chicken teriyaki and the chicken was dry. The rice was super mushy and the portion or broccoli was 4 tiny pieces that were far from steamed"}
{"text":"This is the best teriyaki I have had outside of Seattle which says a lot because I have tried many many places throughout California and beyond.  The beef teriyaki is delicious, clearly marinated for a good period of time before getting grilled for order.  The owner is very friendly as well, so I always like to support people like that.  I will definitely be back for my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"It was okay. .. i had the yakisoba with the chiken and it was good i would have it again but i really doubt it is something i can't live without. I do think it is too expensive for this type of place. yes it was a big portion but i got mostly noodles and not as much meat. in my opinion i think habachi san from the boulevard mall has more flavor and better prices."}
{"text":"Hey everyone it's me Hungry Panda again with another review.  O'Boy do i not want to write this one.. HAHA! I was nice enough and added a star from my original rating I planned on giving.  OK lets get this started from the top :)  Walking into this very CLEAN food joint, i thought to myelf. \"I can totally picture myself eating here on a bi-weekly bases\". It's so clean, lol, and then a friendly voice from behind the counter greeted me with a welcoming smile. JUST AWESOME!  FOOD KNOWLEDGE: After being the usual customer that can't decide anything (like what foot should i start my day off with today, left or right? hmm). HAHA, no but really though, i can be a real pain in the rear end when making a food decission. As i was this time, asking her from the type of meat, the sides included, what they use in sauces and if the sauces were tossed or mixed together. OMGosh she nailed every question I asked with answers beyond my expectations and with a friendly warm smile. Now IDK what most of your opinions are on human energy and vibes or what not. BUTT! This employee hands down deserved a raise. She knew it all, she explained everything in detail with confidence. I'm sorry to drag that out so long, but people I seriously eat out a bunch. Service to me can make me return to a food joint even if i didnt care for the food itself. As you will soon notice :)  FOOD I ATE: Combination, of course the bigger of the plates. Panda serving sizes are always bigger duhh :) Anyways: Chicken Katsu, Orange Chicken, White Rice, Mac Salad.Now lets review backwards;  Mac Salad: Usually not a big fan, but it was yummy. More because it wasn't drowning in mayo and had a good balance of pepper to it. above average for sure :) White Rice: Very poor. it's so hard for me to believe people still cook rice and serve it dry, UGH :( so disaponting. Chicken Katsu: Couldn't tell if it was dark or white meat, either way it also was dry. Even with the Katsu sauce provided on the side (the way i like) it tasted so bland for something fried. Hmm still boggles my mind how that is so. hmm :/ Orange chicken: Looked amazing, smaller sized than most other places and gave it a new impressive look for orange chicken everywhere. BUTT! omgosh people! So dry and bland once again. the nice crisp outside with a orange glaze was good. But don't you know it;s whats on the inside that counts the most. Practically empty in the middle.   WILL I RETURN?: If someone I'm around really wants to go there then yes I will go give it another shot. ONLY because service was much appreciated, and the service saved you from a 2 star. PFF!. Honestly though, waste of my time and money. All you folks out there rating 5 stars on a \"fast food type\" of place. You have given into to the amercan-izing of traditional cultured food. DO NOT attempt to tell me that its decent for the price or for the fast food enviorment. It's really not, and it makes me sad that people pretty much devour anything now a days and say its quality. We must not eat to get full, we eat to feed our hunger. Our hunger must have standards, smell, appearance, texture, then most important, taste. I'd rather eat one palm of quality food versus a large to go box of imitated food thats not good for you anyways. Take off your fat boy eyes and put on your thinking caps, welcome to Panda101 :)  If your going to over eat or eat un-healthy food, at least chose something yummy. LOL genius. Eating bad for convenience is (*^(*FkIAUD*&#(EIHASHDO*(@#"}
{"text":"When I moved to N. LV I couldn't find good Teriyaki anywhere. One day my wife drove by and stopped in and brought home a combo plate with beef teriyaki and chicken teriyaki.   I Love it!  Since then we never go anywhere else. The price isn't the cheapest, but I promise you if you like quality it's well worth it. Plus, it's always clean and has a friendly staff which can be a make or break deal for me."}
{"text":"Customer service was fantastic. Couldn't ask for better service. Food was also fantastic."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but nothing fantastic. The prices are reasonable and the portions are fair for what you pay. The fried rice and yaki soba are pretty good. I would avoid the appetizer items because they are saturated with oil and are too greasy too eat. Its worth a try."}
{"text":"Such an AWESOME place to eat!!!! Food is excellent and the workers are great!!! Special shout-out to one worker, Holden, who was helpful, kind and was so fun to talk to! Great attitude and made our visit even better! We will definately be back and will tell friends and family to eat here.  Great job, Teriyaki Madness!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price...the location is clean and they are pretty fast... just need more customer service practice, but overall is good."}
{"text":"Usually my experience at Teriyaki Madness is nothing short of great.  The food is always fresh & the staff is always friendly.  However, my most recent experience was not a positive one.    I called ahead to order a spicy veggie plate (no meat).  Sandra (the supervisor) told me that they can only make veggie dishes in bowls, not plates.  I explained that I simply wanted to sub veggies for meat in the size of a plate.  She put me on hold for a minute, and then told me she would do that for me and that my order would be ready for pick up in 10 minutes.  When I arrived the food was ready and I was helped by a young male cashier, who was very polite.  He told me the price would be $10.38 for my veggie & rice plate.  This confused me because this is even more expensive than a Chicken Breast Plate...  When I asked him why the veggies were so much more expensive he said he was a new employee and directed me to Sandra.  She proceeded to tell me that there's no button on their POS system for a veggie plate and that was the reason it was so expensive.  This still didn't make sense to me because on my receipt she charged me $7.09 for a veggie bowl and then an additional \"open food charge\" of $2.49...  Sandra insisted there was nothing she could do to lessen the price because there's no \"button\" on their system and she walked away to help other customers.  $10.38 is a lot of money to pay for white rice, cabbage, & broccoli.  Especially when the chick breast is cheaper!  Having worked in the food and beverage industry for many years (I even worked at Teriyaki Madness in my younger years) I know that there are ways to add, change, or delete certain charge amounts for \"open food\" charges.     I rarely write negative reviews because I'm usually pretty understanding, but this situation was not handled professionally.  Sandra wasn't rude, but her lack of ability to work the POS system or find the right \"buttons\" does not reflect the competency of a supervisor.   Instead, it shows laziness & that guest satisfaction is not important.  This situation may sound small, but it's the small inconveniences like this that drive customers away."}
{"text":"It was really good. It was a little more expensive than we were expecting, but the chicken was so fresh and tender. It was falling apart in my chopsticks. We actually felt like we got our money's worth though.   My son had the orange chicken with noodles (no vegs) and he loved it.   I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and crab ragoons. The crab ragoons were good. I've had better, but I would get them again.   My hubby had an egg roll. It was yummy.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"They microwave their food, instead of being fresh off the grill. I wouldnt mind it all if it wasn't 7 dollars for a bowl of microwaved teriyaki chicken. Good food but overpriced. Their portions are lacking too. Yogis teriyaki is better"}
{"text":"Love this place and could eat there every week. Very nice employees and always clean."}
{"text":"Place is super good and very reasonably priced. they have fried rice for an xtra dollar. Well worth it"}
{"text":"The place has changed since I last went here. Great improvement.Awesome staff!! The beef teriyaki was great and their orange chicken was heavenly."}
{"text":"Food is amazing.  Fast, friendly service.  I would go more often, but it's a bit expensive."}
{"text":"I had the spicy chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice and veggies.  It was very good.  The bowls are made to order (I left out the zucchini) so it took about 10 minutes for my order.  The place was spotless and the staff was very friendly.  Great for a quick casual meal!"}
{"text":"Ordered teriyaki chicken and it was good. The order was freshly made so it took a bit longer. Good customer service and clean shop."}
{"text":"The food is great. Ownership and management should know that today's female front register person asked us to hold when we attempted to call in our order. We finally hung up at the 5-6 minutes mark, then tried to call back several times while driving to the restaurant. Upon arrival, there were exactly 4 customers in the place and nobody in line!  When we approached the register and told her we'd been holding all that time, she giggled, reached over and hung up the phone that was off the hook that entire time (20+ minutes).  No apology, just hugs for a young man that had stopped by to see her before she actually took our order.  Wonder how many other people just gave up and went somewhere else?  An apology would have been greatly appreciated... we certainly weren't amused."}
{"text":"i ain't ever coming here again. you guys go out of your way to give some couple a 20% off coupon and not me?? complete bs. nobody come here horrible customer service. h o r r i b l e"}
{"text":"We stopped by this location on our vacation from a recommendation of a friend.  As a mother of 3, you can imagine it is always a chore to find something everyone will agree upon.  Success!  Everyone was able to find something they liked, friendly service and delicious meal."}
{"text":"23 minute wait, only the 3rd person there, never told me what is going on, I gift my money back and left. Can't comment on the food as the service was so bad to begin with. Never to return."}
{"text":"The girl that works cashier I think her name is Sophia  is extremely nice and is always friendly everyone else just gives dirty looks like the manager etc"}
{"text":"Ordered a salmon bowl through Grubhub and when I got it, I was SUPER disappointed. The salmon was way dry to where I didn't even eat it, there was so much water(assuming from the vegetables) at the bottom of the tray it completely rinsed off the teriyaki on top and the vegetables consisted of a piece of broccoli and the rest is cabbage. Way disappointed and probably won't be going back. Only redeeming item was that it did get here fast and the gyoza was yummy."}
{"text":"Love love love Teriyaki Madness! As a returning customer, I appreciate knowing that my food is always fresh and cooked to order. My spicy chicken was so tender, perfectly cooked and flavored! This food is seriously addictive and the customer service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Though I said I would not return my kids love the spicy chicken and convinced me to give it another chance.  Had a good meal with fast service on a busy night."}
{"text":"I used to drive 20 minutes just to get my T-Mad fix at the Craig Road location.  I was highly impressed with the Owner, the cleanliness, and above all - the quality of the chicken bowl. The Centennial Hills location is more convenient to me now, and I have never experienced anything but excellent service here.   Mel C., thank you for your update because I was unaware that any \"gym discount\" existed.  I think this should be advertised, especially to your loyal customers:)."}
{"text":"Bomb ass place for chicken i always get the spicy chicken and white rice no veggies. Its about 12 bucks for a meal kinda expensive but its worth it"}
{"text":"Only the BEST teriyaki in town...  This is a great spot for TASTY grab n' go. My fave meal is the spicy chicken yakisoba (try it with some of the signature teriyaki sauce - OMG) with edamame. I recommend calling ahead, it can be busy with a wait time (they cook to order) around lunch and after-work hours."}
{"text":"Loooooove me some teriyaki madness! Society chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies!! Get in my belly! And the cashiers are polite."}
{"text":"Pros: super fast & friendly service, rice is cooked perfectly, the teriyaki sauce is good! The food is a lot less greasy than most places. Cons: first thing I noticed was nobody had their hair up- ew! The tables were dirty, no individual salt and pepper, not much selection for sides, and the Orange chicken was not very orangey. I guess I wanted something more like panda express orange chicken but less greasy, although that's probably not a very realistic expectation. The egg roll was really flavorless and kinda greasy.   I won't be coming back because they don't put their hair up. The food is ehh, if you're willing to risk eating someone's hair."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to get some good food, although a bit pricey, but the staff was wonderful and the food delicious.   NOT ANY LONGER  I would avoid this location and try one of the others because this one is definitely broken..  Extremely Rude obnoxious staff, inconsistent food quality,  and an overall decline in every regard.    This location needs to be closed because it does not represent the food and service TM is capable of."}
{"text":"The food is good. Just the cashier with the glasses with an old enlish letter tattoo on her hand we just had was so rude. She didn't greet anyone at the register or offer any help. She just stood there looking at me like i was bothering her. After she gave me my change and got my name she didn't say anything. I walked away with this feeling that I did something wrong. I've been to the other location on power road so taking my order is easy. I dont think i will be back to this location. Customer service means a lot to customers and feeling welcome in an establishment goes a long ways."}
{"text":"Fabulous customer service and the workers are amazing! Evelyn and alyssa  made my day an made me feel welcome"}
{"text":"Went here the other day had an amazing lunch and the cashier haley was super cute and friendly and id definitely visit again just to see her pretty eyes and amazing smile!"}
{"text":"Great food when the mood for Teriyaki hits you.  The basic beef teriyaki is sliced thin and in a generous portion.  Very flavorful with a good balance of the teriyaki flavor without drowning out the meat which is always nice and lean served on top of a bed of rice.  The gyzoa is delicious and comes with a delightful sauce to dip it into if you are so inclined, but its plenty good on its own.  A very good appetizer choice.  A good place to pick up a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and I absolutely LOVE their food!!!! We continue to go back to visit because I am mad over teriyaki madness *=} great menu items and everything is great! You MUST visit....especially this store. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The chicken was so tender,  teriyaki sauce is perfect,  Crab Rangoon was the best I've had in a long time.  I highly recommend this place! You are MAD if you don't go here!"}
{"text":"The ladies at the front are always great. My order is correct, they're quick, and friendly. And the food is always great. I frequent here often and never have had an issue"}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this, because up until now, the service is pretty good and the food is pretty decent--when they get it right. Should they make a mistake, expect no apology and massive attitude problems.   My husband and I live literally around the corner from this TM. We order food weekly. Since we order there a lot we know what the meals should taste like, and when it is obvious that someone has screwed up. Today I called in an order for 2 tofu teriyaki bowls with fried rice, one without cabbage. The woman who took the order was named Marianne.   I picked up the order and without checking it, drove a half hour away to drop one of the bowls off to my husband for lunch. I was about 20 minutes into my drive back home when he sent me a message asking if I had remembered to order fried rice, because his was white rice. I checked my bowl and sure enough, white rice. (Bear in mind they charge more for fried rice, so this isn't a purely picky-palate issue.)  At this point I was far closer to the restaurant than I was to his job, so I drove back to TM. While I drove, I called Teriyaki Madness and spoke again with Marianne. I explained that a mistake had been made, and requested both bowls be redone with fried rice. One bowl was with my husband a half hour away, I said, but I could return the other bowl. She sounded confused, then annoyed, then asked \"Well do you want both bowls redone NOW?\". I said yes.  I came to pick up the new bowls. Only one had been redone, and Marianne and the (manager? person who runs the kitchen? she looked too unprofessional to be a manager, yet too much in charge to be only working in the kitchen) were both waiting for me. Both were scowling at me. I asked where the second bowl was. Marianne's response: \"You said you only wanted to return one.\" I said \"No, I was only able to physically return one, the other one is a half hour away, but I wanted both redone--both were made wrong.\" At this point the manager, whose name I sadly did not get, opened up the bowl I had brought back and asked what was wrong with it. I explained that it was white rice, not fried. She pokes around in the bowl and exclaims \"this IS fried rice!\" I said no, it's white. She points to the vegetables. \"IT'S FRIED!\" (She is literally yelling at me at this point). I said \"When I picked up the rice with my fork to look at it, it was nothing but white, and clumpy. It's not fried\" (by the time she saw it, it had been sitting almost an hour, and the teriyaki sauce had soaked into the rice, turning it brown--so I can understand her confusion-- but regardless, it certainly was not fried). She said \"Well then maybe it wasn't mixed together enough, but it IS fried!!\". Um? Fried rice is, for starters, FRIED that brown color, with bits of egg added. It shouldn't be white and clumpy! You shouldn't have to mix it up!   Stunned and angered by the attitude and the yelling, I finally had had enough of the abuse and walked out of the restaurant. I never got an apology for their mistake, I was given nothing but attitude problem and was not offered both properly made bowls as I deserve. I knew better than to insist on them remaking them then, as I have no doubt I would have gotten spit in my food at that point.  I would like an apology from the manager for the unbelievably rude customer service and a credit issued to my debit card for both teriyaki bowls, or a gift card or equivalent for 2 teriyaki bowls (that I will use at another TM location!). Regardless of whether the staff thought the bowls were made properly, the behavior they exhibited was absolutely unacceptable. I went in politely requesting an exchange--not even a refund, just an exchange--and was treated horribly. I am happy to edit this review should appropriate action be taken. Upon scrolling through the other comments on Yelp, though, it seems I am not alone when it comes to poor customer service, and should not hold my breath."}
{"text":"Very clean and new looking . Brown rice option at no extra charge great option . Chicken breast bowl was nice and moist and veggies were stir fired in a lite teriyaki sauce but still crisp to the bite . Lots of extra sauce on each table ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Whenever I come, I'm always satisfied. The workers are always helpful, the store is clean and let me tell you the food is fresh and they give huge portion sizes. I love this place."}
{"text":"I'm doing it again. I am addicted to the madness. So full right now. Yummy. If you haven't tried it you better, you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Clean, fresh, delicious, Excellent customer service. We will be back. Farther from our home but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Teriyaki madness is the bomb ! It can be a healthy meal with steamed veggies and grilled chicken breast :) with sauce on the side"}
{"text":"Horrible service every time we come here. Cashiers seems like they don't even want to be there to help the customers. Almost feel like we are intruding in their time . They never get any of our orders right. Other locations are ok but this one is the worst! I hope the franchise owner sees this review and make changes. We are paying for our food so it's not like we're getting it for free. If these employees don't like to serve customers, then they should not work here."}
{"text":"When I go I always  get the spicy  Teriyaki  chicken and vegetables.  It is very good, my favorite  part is they have bottles of Teriyaki  sauce on every table so you can put as much as you want on your food! A bit pricey but they  do give you a good size portion.  My one complaint would be, I would like to have a better option for a side of chicken. Currently  it's $6.29 and one option only. Other than that I like it alot."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. The real standout here is the people. Friendly folks that take pride in their work and are also fans of the food. Every time I come I tweak the order (no veggies, extra sauce on one, extra veggies on another etc.). They always get it right. That business model keeps us coming back for more..."}
{"text":"I was part of a catering time order for the UNLV Basketball team on Friday night @ 8:30 pm. The order was placed on Thursday, with the understanding just how crucial it was to be delivered no later than 8:30.So the Basketball team and staff could eat ASAP, after the game We were told not a problem.The night shift would be in charge of that. Also we TIP the night shift very well. The food arrived over 30 minutes late. It is a 4 minute delivery from the Restaurant to drop off. At 8:35 We reach out to the restaurant and the response we received. Well we are very busy. I'm sorry. We called every few minutes and the same response.It was very frustrating dealing with there response knowing that everyone involved understand the importance of the food delivery to be on time. Seeing the team and coaches waiting till 9:00pm Was also frustrating. We are just very disappointed."}
{"text":"So yummy! We get this every time I'm in town visiting from Chicago. I spent $57.00 on a large amount of food, great dinner, and enough for us to do lunch...the only thing missing was my two orders of egg rolls. I called and talked to Patricia, and told her I would expect them next we come in, she took my name. Thank you."}
{"text":"Not bad. This is my second visit to Teriyaki Madness but at a different location. Visited during lunch which luckily wasn't busy. This time I ordered the chicken katsu bowl with white rice and stir fried vegetables to go. It was good, but I wish they gave out a little more sauce. All good though."}
{"text":"After my mattress shopping, I stopped by Teriyaki madness for lunch since it was in the area. This was a first visit but the menu was pretty straight forward. Choose the protein, type of rice, and if you want vegetables with it. I ordered the spicy chicken bowl with white rice and stir fried vegetables to go. The ladies who took my order were nice and my food didnt take too long. When I got home to eat it wasn't that great and it wasn't too bad. Just plain. The chicken had a nice spiciness to it but nothing to rave about. Meh. Ive had better chicken teriyaki bowls from other places but I'm still game for trying something else on their menu next time."}
{"text":"Looking forward in coming here again. Delicious food with good size portions.  Friendly customer service and quick serving of food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"First visit was not expecting the chicken to have so much sauce, they were very nice to make over for me, and did not make a fuss over it. So ask for sauce on the side, unless you are a sauce junky.  I did vegetables no rice. I will repeat."}
{"text":"Delicious salmon bowl with brown rice and veggies. Super filling and tasty!! Looking forward to trying other protein selections!!"}
{"text":"Great food, and great customer service. The best Teriyaki location I have been too. The manager or franchise owner is really nice and engaging!"}
{"text":"Fast, Friendly, Tasty, & CHEAP!!!  Quick & Easy fix for my Japanese Food cravings.  The Katsu & Beef Teriyaki are my Favorites. I suggest opting for the \"All White Meat\" option I LOVE the Teriyaki Sauce!!"}
{"text":"I like Madness because their rice is so good. Simple and good value. this time tried beef plate with mac salad. it reminds me tsukudani..."}
{"text":"Had my first meal there this evening. Food was great and priced well. Everything was clean. Employees were friendly. Great experience."}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for a fast place to satisfy a teriyaki craving. Usually only takes about 5 minutes to get your order, so it's great for a bite when you're short on time. I really like the crisp salad that comes with orders of the plates. Sometimes the spicy chicken can be REALLY spicy, but I enjoy watching my friend try to eat it while accumulating tears in his eyes :)"}
{"text":"Food is delish, but lady forgot to give me my salad so I had to ask her for it. She was like \"oh yeah!\" 5 mins later.... Nothing. She had forgotten again, and continued conversing with a coworker up front. Needless to say, I walked out never getting my salad. Another time we ordered 1 side of white rice and it took 20 mins - no exaggeration. Ridic!!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was great.  I love being able to customize my order with meat & vegetables with tofu as well. The flavor was just right & not too salty. Eating clean with convenience, what more could you want. You adjust your food to meet your macros.  The staff was very pleasant & helpful. Definitely a place I would go to frequently.  Wish there was one close to me."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I refrained from writing this review for some time. I wanted to give them another chance. I had a free bowl for the previous time because my order was completely messed up... I ordered my new order and even though I had a free one they still charged my for both.... I don't mind paying for food that is correct.. once again my order was wrong that I just paid full price for... I feel like chicken and rice isn't that complicated to get right... this was their chance to fix their first mistake... once again wrong! Not worth the money and pain in the ass."}
{"text":"Took a couple minutes to cook the food, but it was worth the wait! The cashier folks were really awesome too! Super helpful and friendly. The teriyaki isn't spicy but it's? tasty, the beef is really tender, and the veggies were good too. A solid amount of food for the price."}
{"text":"This new place was awesome from top to bottom!!  Consistently super friendly & attentive staff, tables & chairs were clean as were the bathrooms.  The food was AMAZING!  We tried almost everything.  The mouth watering spicy chicken was my favorite!  It was perfectly cooked as was the rice and vegetables.  The portions were large so plenty of leftovers to take home.  I wasn't crazy about the salmon but the beef and katsu chicken were delicious!!  The kids bowls were perfect!  They loved the yakisoba noodles, chicken and beef.  They even liked the veggies which is a first!  I love how they offer a balanced meal-- protein, carb & veggies.  They encourage healthy eating which is refreshing!  The price for everything is well worth every penny.  I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!  Your order is cooked fresh which means there is a bit of a wait but not terrible; definitely worth the wait.  And the amount of food is well worth the cost which is totally reasonable.  I can use the leftovers for at least 2 more meals!  Love their spicy chicken-- all time favorite!  The noodles are amazing and the veggies perfectly cooked!  The menu includes a bunch of healthy choices.  Brown rice available which is probably what I should have had but LOVE them noodles!  Next time for sure! ; )  The restaurant is brand new so of course, new employees getting used to the system.  The place was super clean and service was great!  The location is perfect for quick grab and go lunch!  You can even order on-line making it super fast!!  Couldn't be happier!!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness is some of the best teriyaki chicken in town... Thumbs-up love this place... Also get some of their teriyaki sauce to go make multiple awesome dishes at home..."}
{"text":"Food was great! My bride and I shared a couple choices off their menu. We enjoyed the spicy orange chicken bowl w/ fried rice(an extra .50 for spicy, and an extra 1.00 for fried rice), an egg roll, a side of their noodles, and an order of potstickers. We placed our order using the link on the yelp app. It was a total 5 star experience other than the staff. Our order took way too long, the employees were playing grab ass, and the person who TRIED to hand me my food had just walked inside from (reluctantly) taking out the trash without pausing to wash their hands. Likely poor management, as the behavior and traits were present in both the service staff and the cook staff. I would try them again. Maybe the service is better for the lunch crowd..."}
{"text":"The staff are not very welcoming and the food is pretty much average in comparison to the other locations. Considering the unwelcoming feel from the employees it's easy to see how the food is just average. You definitely get your moneys worth, regardless.  So far I've tried the spicy chicken, which was....ok...and tried the chicken katsu which was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl w/noodles & veggies.Food was so good, I should've ordered the plate because it has more food. I enjoyed the music that was playing and felt a good positive vibe. I will definitely be back. I was given a coupon for my next visit...can't wait to use it!"}
{"text":"Highly addicting. My go to almost every day after work. And Janet's the coolest lady around!"}
{"text":"The worst experience at this place! Placed an order through Uber eats, food was delivered and was missing a whole plate and another plate completely incorrect! Contacted this place and the rep had no kind of sympathy, I told her I'm on my way to pick up my plates. I get to this place and she tells me you have to bring the other plates back. I told her I'm not driving all the way back home so you can see what you did wrong!! I'm telling you as a paid customer what was wrong!!! She tells me we're making it. After waiting 20+minutes, she says she contacted the owner and he said to come back tomorrow with the incorrect plate and the receipt!!! WOW Unbelievable. The rep didn't say she contacted the owner until I asked what was taking so long, UNREAL! So she says you have to come back tomorrow to speak to Robert Gonzales to see about making the plates. This was once my favorite place but after dealing with incompetent individuals who apparently can't read or make things right with a customer, I will never come back here again! I will be there tomorrow bright and early to see the owner and return this incorrect plate tho!!! SMH"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great alternative. I always get the teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice or minus rice with veggies.  Beware, food is addicting.  Staff is great also."}
{"text":"Good for take out. Employees are really loud behind counter.Foods cooked solid and tastes great so obviously their party atmosphere helps."}
{"text":"Do not expect to get much for your money here.  $8 for a plate of tofu and brown rice and a small portion of salad on the side.  We were expecting vegetables with the plate.  It's a good thing that my husband didn't order anything because he remembered how bad it was the last time.  Look at their pictures.  All of their teriyaki \"bowls\" are served with just the protein over rice, no vegetables, unless you pay extra for the plate and get a little bit of salad on the side.   I miss Samurai Sam's so much!  I do have to say though, that TM's All-Vegetable bowls are far better than China-a-Go-Go, which gives you 90% noodles and a few pieces of broccoli.  My first reaction when I opened the boxed plate was, WTF!!!(Where's The Food, or you know what)!  We were very disappointed and most likely will NOT return."}
{"text":"In the last couple weeks I've heard a lot about Teriyaki madness so I had I go try it out for myself. I went Monday around 6pm, and the place was empty! Not a good sign. The first thing I noticed was the few selections on the menu. Kinda like chipotle. I just ordered the traditional teriyaki chicken bowl. I had mine with white rice and salad.   The teriyaki was very tasty! I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, even tho I had way too much rice vs teriyaki. The salad was subpar. Nothing to talk about. The drink selection was limited to fountain drinks. For all the hype I've heard about this place, quite frankly I expected a lot more. Very comparable to your fast food Panda Express, or chipotle and honestly, id rather go to those places...  -Joseph"}
{"text":"Their beef yakisoba is basically Panda Express chow mein, and their spicy chicken isn't spicy. I asked the cashier behind the counter what their yakisoba sauce was made of, and she responded with, \"It's a yakisoba sauce.\""}
{"text":"I got the noodle bowl with veggies and it was delicious ! Nice and hot and the size of the bowl was able to feed me for dinner and lunch the next day . I will be going again :)"}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving teriyaki and want to go some place fast, Teriyaki Madness always is the first place that comes to mind. Compared to some of the other Teriyaki places it is a little pricey. But all others lack when it comes to taste and variety.  A simple bowl already comes with great flavor. When you add the sauce they have, the taste is magnified. My only wish is that they would get more locations around town."}
{"text":"Great food, and great service. I could eat here every day and not get tired of it. Their teriyaki sauce is bomb. Once you try it your addicted."}
{"text":"The slogan for Teriyaki Madness is \"Warning: Highly addictive food\" I would have to say that is very accurate, I am a level 2 addict of their spicy chicken bowls. It has a little kick to it, but it is sooo good. Healthy Food, Elvis impersonator as a mascot, in a nice clean restaurant. Count me in."}
{"text":"This is the second location I have been to in Las Vegas. I am happy to say its just as good as the one on Warm Springs. The best deal in the place is the two-combo plate at $8.25. Spicy Chicken and Beef Teriyaki  for the win!   I think the location on Warm Springs has better ambiance since its on a corner in the strip mall and has more light. The hall-way on the side of the counter where you sit is a little narrow and I was creeped out by it. I really don't know why."}
{"text":"Came in here during lunch on the weekend feeling hungry and didn't want to cook. Decided I wanted some teriyaki chicken. I called in for a pick-up order. Ordered a combination plate which included chicken/tofu with vegetables and brown rice. Got there about 10 minutes later and my order was ready. Grabbed napkins and a fork because you know that feeling when you find out they didn't leave you with any napkins.   The chicken was good and moist. The sauce wasn't too sugary. Pretty good amount of protein. The vegetables could have been better. They gave me alot of cucumbers and 1 broccoli piece."}
{"text":"I stop at Teriyaki madness at least once a week.  I have never been disappointed.  My favorite is a regular teriyaki chicken bowl with extra vegetables.  You cant stop eating the Yummy bowl And when you Are done you'll never go away feeling hungry.  This place is fast, fresh and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"We have come to this location several times and it's hit or miss with the food.  We really liked the spicy chicken but on several occasions it was burnt.  We tried the orange chicken and it was our new favorite until this past Saturday evening.  As soon as I saw the orange chicken I knew immediately it was going to be terrible and it was.  It was so overcooked you could not pierce it with a fork or cut it with a knife.  It looked like freeze dried dog treats- I wish I had taken a picture.  I did not bring it back, I ate around it and will never to back. I also overheard the workers in the back talk about one of the customers.  The employees preparing the food do not wear hair nets. Most of the employees we have encountered are very nice- but because we don't know what we are going to get with the food we won't eat here again.  It's too bad- we liked that there was a healthy option close to home."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff, always good food and LOVE the spicy chicken breast plate! Add veggies or rice for only a $1.00 extra to any plate or bowl! Their punch card is great, 10th plate is free!"}
{"text":"Thought it was going to be good, but ended up disappointed.  It was expensive as well.  I had a teriyaki bowl.  They charged me an extra dollar for vegetables, really!  Also got charged an extra dollar for white meat.   Other local teriyaki joints don't charge for those things and they are better.  I will never go back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  The food is very flavorful and healthy. I've had both the bowls with the rice and low-carb (no rice, all veggies).  I think I'm going to stick with the low-carb bowls going forward unless I have a strong craving for carbs. Very reasonable prices too. If you're looking for something that tastes great, very filling and healthy (trying to get away from the usual fast food) this is the place to go. It's now my official go to for picking up something eat."}
{"text":"They use cheap meat. Ends up being chewy and not edible. Not worth the money they charge."}
{"text":"I've been here to times and each time I got a bowl free with a coupon.The first time I got teriyaki beef it was salty and the noodles were very greasy. The second time I got the same thing and it wasn't greasy or salty."}
{"text":"Live their spicy teriyaki bowl! It's fast, healthy, reasonably priced and really good!! Definitely a great alternative to nasty mcdonalds & other fast food"}
{"text":"The food was good. The prices were too high. The customer service started out iffy and ended up quite poor. If you just want good food and don't care about price and customer service, this place is good. The chicken breast and beef teriyaki were both very good. The vegetables were good, but they didn't have a ton of flavor. The macaroni salad is the standard macaroni salad for these places, but I enjoyed it more than other places. The kid meals cost more than we'd like, but they were a lot of food. It's nice that the kids have all the same options as the standard menu."}
{"text":"Went her for lunch with my kids, nieces and sister.  Ordered the spicy chicken with fried rice and veggies.  Everything was hot.  The chicken was delicious.  First time going to this location.  They had satellite radio playing and let me tell you,  we hung out for like an extra hour just talking and enjoying the music.  Good job on that!  Restaurant was nice and clean and the ladies room was too."}
{"text":"I frequent this location and this review is based on customer service experience , good food , unhappy service. I have stated always visit and like the food, my disappointment is that asking to order the bowl with what comes with teriyaki chicken , I've asked for no sauce and to be grilled chicken as per my kids age 5 and 3 do not eat it. Not a complicated request , I think ? To be told my manager says this is the last time we will do that . Sorry to say we will no longer be ordering or visiting this business again. Lost a frequent customer, please think about being in a service business , minor customer request should be accommodated ."}
{"text":"Worst service !!!!! 8-10 times this place is on point !! Today ! Burger King or Del taco would have been better and I never eat either one! Waited 40 minutes for two orders! A lady next to me order rice and waited the same amount of time!! Patience! No \"sorry, here's a discount for next time\" nothing ! And all the phone orders were being told 5 minute wait time ! It's going to be a long time before I go back !!! And the menu changed!!!"}
{"text":"T-MAD.  Don't be MAD at it...embrace it!  I love this place and yesterday I went way out of my way to curb my craving...sometimes you just gotta do it.  It was quite worth the drive.  I don't usually visit this location because I'm a Centennial girl and frequent that location but I've been to this one a couple time before.  This one seems a little older and not as freshly decorated and modern as the one in Centennial.  Upon entering the place was pretty busy as it was like 1:30 in the afternoon.  There was a cute young girl at the front ready to take my order.  I ordered the chicken breast plate extra spicy with a side of the mac salad....my usual and full intentions on make 2 meals out of it.  The \"plates\" are huge and I would never order it if I didn't have intentions on having leftovers.  I would just order the bowl and even the bowl is big.  A lot of the reviews I've read rave about ordering your food spicy.  It really is so good if you like spicy.  I wouldn't want it any other way.  I believe you can order any of their dishes spicy for an additional charge.  Do it!  Occasionally I will change it up and order the steak yakisoba which has such an amazing flavor.  You cant go wrong with that either.  While I was waiting on my food to be prepared the girl who took my order took full advantage of in between customers to clean tables.  She was all over it.  I love hard workers especially young people.  Nice to see.   As she brought my order out to me I asked her if there was some Sriracha packets and fully expecting her to point me in the right direction she said to wait a second and she would get me some.  I don't know why stuff like that suprises me!  Probably because we live in such a lazy world!  Funny but not funny.   Anyways great customer service.   I like it.  I ordered my lunch to go and could barely wait to get back to the office.  It was great-as always.  Yummay!  ...and I have leftovers for today!  Score!  =)"}
{"text":"T-Mad as we call it is probably one of the best fast food places in Vegas....on the healthier side of fast food.  We frequent this place and have spent lots of money here.  Thier food is alway consistent and quality with huge quantity.  I can say that I have never been disappointed.  Over the years Ive been a huge fan of Samurai Sam's and T-Mad had alot to live up to.  If given the choice Teriyaki Madness is my fav by a long shot!   I usually get the chicken breast plate with brown rice EXTRA spicy-sometimes get the steak-chicken combo.  I dont know what they put on it to make it spicy but that sh** is the bomb.  They have teriyaki sauce at the tables and I usually drown my chicken. I get the \"plate\"-its gigantic-so I can take half of it home to heat up for lunch.  Its just as good as having it fresh.  Oh yeah and the mac salad is delish-it comes with the plate!  My boyfriend gets the steak lo mein and I usually steal at least 3 bites of his.  The flavor is ridiculous.  He usually orders mac salad with it because its just that good.  The staff is always friendly and the place is always packed.  They even sent me a free entree email for my birthday which I took full advantage of.  As you can see I'm a big fan of T-MAD....you should try it! ;)"}
{"text":"The food here is good but my order was messed up. I got home and called to let you know one of our bowls was messed up. It was supposed to be the white chicken breast but we got the normal chicken. I don't live close enough to come back immediately to get a replacement so they said I could get 20% off on a different day. What the hell is that?? I should get it free because our food was messed up. If that's your policy I wouldn't come here again. That's really messed up. Really crappy customer service and definitely not a way to build a reputation and clientele. Manager or owner should get it together"}
{"text":"Great place to go after the gym ... The teryaki chicken has lots of protein, brown rice and lots of vegetables!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki. The flavor was good, but some of my chicken had fat on it. I was really grossed out by the large pieces of fat in my meal. My husband ordered the orange chicken. Again, the flavor was good. However, there was not nearly enough sauce on it. The restaurant was clean, and the staff was friendly but I prefer the food at Panda Express."}
{"text":"New teriyaki place in Gilbert.  They were pretty slow, I hope it's just growing pains.  1 star for the slow service. 3 stars for the food.  I got the chicken breast teriyaki bowl with veggies and no rice.  I would get the either the spicy chicken or regular chicken teriyaki next time.  They both had more flavor and weren't dry like the breast meat.  I liked that I could get all veggies instead of rice and wasn't up-charged for it.  I will give them some time to figure it all out and will give it another try, they did give us a couple buy one get one coupons after all."}
{"text":"Came to eat today. Upon paying on the kiosk, I was prompted to leave a tip in the suggested amount of 15-20%. For what?? I'll tip when it's appropriate but that's going a little overboard on the whole tipping concept."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Love having them so close to my gym so I can grab a healthy meal on the way home!"}
{"text":"On my way to Galleria mall early in the year I noticed there was another \"T-Mad\" off the freeway exit, since I rarely come this direction I thought I'd give this location a try. I'm glad I did because it's now one o my favorite places for fast food. I live in the opposite side of town but because I shop at the grocery store Winco once a week I come here right after work on Fridays, eat and shop.  My favorite is the chicken breast with brown rice and veggies. The breast is always moist and the teriyaki sauce is delishhhh! I'm very picky about my rice as well, I can't stand mushy rice and I have yet to experience that here with both the white and brown rice. Service is always fast and friendly but sometimes it can also get really busy. One of the sayings I abide is \"you wouldn't rush your mama in the kitchen so don't rush other cooks\". It's true, I want my food  yummy so I wait!   I've been  to the one on Maryland and the one on Warm Springs, I didn't like it because the chicken was over cooked and dried."}
{"text":"Had some beef and chicken teriyaki take out the other night. I'm not one to write negative reviews but the food was unacceptable- over- cooked, over-salted unrecognizable dog food. I returned for an apology and refund."}
{"text":"Good food, but need to have an adult running the shop. All teens there, talking behind the counter. We walked in and it was hot, which is extremely annoying to us when you want to eat inside and its warm inside on a hot day like today. We almost left just because of that, but i was hoping it'd be cooler in the dining area. We ordered and the girl was nice. Went to find a table, but most were dirty, had to ask someone to clean off the table. Waited too long for our food (Teriyaki chicken/rice bowls, potstickers), waited about 15 minutes or so, but after we asked the girl that bussed our table to please turn the A/C down, it seemed to get cooler, so we didn't mind waiting after that.  Food came and it was a all good, no complaints. When leaving, couldn't throw our trash away because the trash was overflowing. Yet the workers were all behind the counter not doing much.  Used the bathroom to wash my hands after touching the trash to try to throw ours away, and the bathroom was gross. Lesson to new owner: Need a caring manager there at all times. Frustrating!  Won't be back to dine in, might take out next time, but I'd call ahead because I wouldn't want that long wait again for take out."}
{"text":"Great for quick pick up...hot and fresh. Veggie stir fry w/tofu is good"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the best time to go is in the day when Vanessa is working she has the best customer service and it's the only time they are not all over the place!!!"}
{"text":"I really want this place to be successful as I want to support other small business owners.  The staff were nice and the restaurant warm and clean.  However, I took less than 5 bites of my food and just tossed it. The rice was sticky and the meat tasted like it was microwaved with sauce spread on top.  It just plain wasn't good.  I hope it improves but I'm not sure I'll return."}
{"text":"Not really much to talk about; great healthy food, great service and fair prices.  This place has hearty meals for the everyday athlete."}
{"text":"Super good! The chicken is amazing and taste like REAL teriyaki chicken! The workers were also very nice and made sure we had everything we needed I'd definitely recommend and it's supper quick too"}
{"text":"Yummmy! Much healthier option than Panda and good sized portions.  Love the spicy chicken!  Menu is simple and not over done. Staff looks happy, noticed both times I was there that the workers were smiling and are eager to offer polite customer service (can't find that very often). Great location on Power Rd for quick take out. I'm for sure going back. Seriously. ... try the spicy chicken it's the bomb!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware of the catering portions. Ordered for 18 people didnt even feed 15 people. Trays were not full half empty rice and veggies. I felt mislead by manager on portions and price. Would have been better off to order individual bowls with discount coupons. With that being said what food we did get was good."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long while, it seems different then I remember it tastes better. I love the flavor, I had the Yakisoba noodles spicy. The veggies were cooked perfect the chicken was very good, the perfect amount of spice so I could still taste the flavors of each individual item in my bowl without being over powered by it but still had kick to it.  I also had Edamame and it was cooked perfect steamed just right and not to much salt added.  I called ahead for pick-up, the order was ready, staff was friendly, established was clean.  I will be back again,  I recommend this location in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy teriyaki bowl.  It was okay.   In my opinion,   it wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE food and service. Chicken is soggy and disgusting and they leave the rice out so it's nasty (they try to cover it in sauce but it's atrocious). I tried it on two different occasions it was flat out bad both times. The employees seem like they don't care about anything either. Just not a good place at all to eat. Do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place! I have frequented the Mesa location quite a few times, and can't get enough of that Spicy Chicken and veggies!  Granted, its busy because it just opened, so we can expect lines to be longer than usual.  All I know is my order of pot stickers and Spicy Chicken bowl came out in a timely fashion taking into consideration how busy they were. The chicken was juicy and veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly.  Will be coming back as often as I can... they have the formula done right here."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. I order the same thing every time, multiple times a week. I literally always order the same thing. Plain grilled chicken no sauce, and even though they don't remember me they usually get it right.    Chicken is awesome.  Service is relatively fast. You can't hate on this place. They have never given me diarrhea.   The screw up rate is next to zero.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness is a good place to grab some healthy take-out fast food. The restaurant isn't crowded, and if there's a line, it's usually a 10 minute wait at most before they take your order.  I got the chicken teriyaki and asked them to hold the teriyaki sauce since I wanted to see how their chicken tasted sans sauce. I got the brown rice and stir-fried vegetables with the plate. The stir-fried vegetables had a mild soy sauce flavor and a grilled texture, but were still crisp from the freshness. The chicken tasted good and was well made. It wasn't dry and was very juicy.  The restaurant was clean and there's no wait staff. The atmosphere was very casual.  Teriyaki Madness is a good place to get your protein if you're trying to eat cleaner and healthier, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, but the tables and floors were really dirty. And a manager was nowhere to be found. Overall the cashiers were friendly, and they helped make my order easy."}
{"text":"Fast food teriyaki that is not good. Did not even finish my meal. Tastes like frozen microwave food. It's a hard pass for me."}
{"text":"I moved here from Seattle 10 years ago and hunted for the perfect teriyaki bowl I could easily find in WA.    Teriyaki Madness is awesome!  Even my kids love it which is amazing in itself.  You can buy their sauce but I can never cook my chicken as moist as theirs.  I true treat.    Definitely helped my homesickness."}
{"text":"I had the spicy teriyaki chicken plate with white rice and vegetables . This was a lot of food, I even had left overs for dinner. I used a Groupon on this visit which was an awesome deal ! The food is good and somewhat healthy for fast food."}
{"text":"Good food , healthy , and always tests the same( that's a good thing haha).   Breast bowl with brown rice and veggies!!! Yummy !! And the egg rolls too.  Can't go wrong if you go here!!"}
{"text":"Overall, super yummy--but a lil pricey.  I'm half-Japanese, so my preference tends to lean towards the authentic. I was initially skeptical, but pleasantly surprised by my experience here.  We had the spicy teriyaki chicken bowl and beef teriyaki bowl over brown rice with veggies.  The beef teriyaki reminded me of Korean bulgogi: sweet, savory and yummy! The spicy teriyaki was recommended by the girl who took our order, and tastes like a slightly  spicy BBQ sauce with an Asian flare. Not exactly teriyaki tasting, but yummy nonetheless.  The meat itself was good quality, no nasty stringy fat that sometimes plagues lower quality Asian foods.  The veggies were perfectly cooked, with a light sauce--nothing overpowering. I would have liked a lil more!  The rice was short-grain, authentic tasting, and very generous amount. I ended up using some of the teriyaki sauce they provide on all the tables for a little more flavor, which was fantastic--not too sweet, yum! (Some of the staff was eating at the same time and we noticed they all went with the noodles instead of rice, maybe next time?)  If you're looking for some Asian food that's more authentic and healthier than Panda, I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki is my favorite type of food and this Teriyaki Madness is the best!  I usually come here right after the gym and pick up a spicy chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice, it is the bomb. I like this location because sometimes they remember me and know what I'm going to order before I open my mouth. I am a regular and keep coming back because the food/service is awesome"}
{"text":"we eat here alot, but this id the second time getting my order wrong at this location. Love the food but i will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time with a Groupon.  I had been forewarned about the portion sizes (thank you, Yelpers) so we split a chicken yakisoba order for lunch.  The portion was absolutely huge - we both ate until we were full and still had half left to take home for tomorrow.  The food was fresh and hot, and one of the servers brought us a small container of their \"signature spicy sauce\" to try which was perfect on the noodles - they were a little bland otherwise.  In addition to noodles and chicken pieces, the yakisoba had cabbage, broccoli, and carrots so it was very healthy.  Cabbage pieces were too large but they were easy to cut up.  I agree that the prices seem a little high - the bill for one chicken yakisoba and one soda was a few cents under $12.  But when you consider we had a $7 Groupon and will be able to get 4 individual lunches out of it, it's a steal."}
{"text":"The absolute best teriyaki place you will ever eat! Fresh delicious food and fast service. Tried teriyaki beef for first time tonight and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is.....   WOW...EXPENSIVE!!!!  Not a very friendly place. Cashier seems like she didn't want to be there at all....not very cheerful and that's what the food is too. Dull and bland."}
{"text":"I tried this place out after hearing about it from the tip jar stories. It ordered egg roll, shrimp tempura and tofu with brown rice and veggies. The apps were OK but nothing great. The tofu was acceptable. The rice was a little dry. The veggies were almost entirely cabbage. The pictures show large pieces of broccoli and other items. What I got was just soggy cabbage with some carrot shavings in it so I had tofu with dry rice and it wasn't very good. It probably would have been good if there was a decent variety of veggies in it."}
{"text":"I regret going here but was with a friend who wanted to try it. It was just a bunch of dried out meat with teriyaki sauce thrown on top and placed on rice. The rice could've used more sauce or something because it was dry along with the meat. I got a mixed chicken & beef bowel. The beef had a strange taste and kind of tasted like liver. It was probably a cheap cut of beef. The only plus was that the cashier was friendly. There was a good reason for me to avoid this place after all these years living here."}
{"text":"First visit.   Food was okay but so over priced I won't be back.   $27 for two dinner plates one with extra chicken.   I can go to Panda and get the same food for half the price."}
{"text":"Love their spicy chicken . Never tasted it like that anywhere . It's delicious !!!! It  has a kick to it .  It makes perfect match with the rice & vegetables with teriyaki sauce.  Amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Its hard to find fast food service with restaurant quality meals, but at Teriyaki Madness, I am never disappointed. We always order their signature plate, the Spicy Chicken, which is chicken teriyaki stir-fried in hot & spicy sauce. I've also tried the Chicken Katsu tastes similar to Hawaiian restaurants. The plates also come with steamed white RICE (the most important staple food for us Asians! haha) and a side salad or macaroni salad. One thing that is great about Teriyaki Madness is that they offer healthier choices which you can subtitute in your meal (ie. brown rice, low carb chicken or beef with mixed veggies). For fast good quality Asian food, Teriyaki Madness will always be the first place on my mind!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here and ordered a spicy teriyaki chicken bowl and then they brought out my food literally 2 minutes after ordering. I opened it, took a few bites, and realized it was normal teriyaki. I was going to ask them to fix it While waiting for my friends order to come. But they brought both bowls, a spicy and an orange bowl. Then they took my original teriyaki bowl away. I watched the people in the kitchen put it in a bag and give it to the actual person who ordered it, I had eaten most of the vegetables in the bowl and they didn't even check. I couldn't believe what I had saw. 2 stars because I actually got my spicy bowl and it was decent."}
{"text":"The food here is barely passable. I ordered the Yakisoba Beef Noodles which only comes in one size - large. Almost $10 bucks for this bowl of noodles with tiny bits of beef. The sauce had a strange flavor that I think was Siracha but I'm not sure. I barely ate ¼ of this dish. My friend ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl and he enjoyed it. Panda Express offers much better food than this joint. Doubt I will ever return"}
{"text":"Firstly horrible service on the phone, now I go in on Friday the 2nd and they are out of chicken breast so I had to eat dark meat when I am a bodybuilder getting ready for a show. Absolutely ridiculous. Time to step things up there and shit or get off the pot."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken is one of my favorite meals of all time. Love this place. You can get the veggie assortment or sometimes we just get broccoli only. The teriyaki sauce is awesome and they give you fast friendly service and hit made to order food. Can't beat this yummy healthy place!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite to eat before heading to the airport to not looking to sit down at a traditional restaurant. Glad to have found this gem! I got the bowl with teriyaki beef and rice with veggies. It was so delicious. We walked in and were greeted immediately with smiles and we were overlooking the menu since this was our very first time and the cashier was very helpful with suggesting and telling us our options. We sat at clean tables and had extra condiments on the table so no need to even ask."}
{"text":"The customer service is not the best. The food is ok, but again the customer isn't the best. The young lady at the front always has an attitude and isn't friendly at all. I've only been to this location twice I'll definitely think again before returning"}
{"text":"Its a good try at a good teriyaki place. I went here twice, figuring that maybe the first time I just came on the wrong day. Sadly enough I feel like I spent way to much money for what I got. For $6.50 I got fried (unseasoned) tofu and rice. That's it. I even had to put on my own teriyaki sauce! I could have made this at home! So the second time I got the tofu stirfry and was suprised to get unseasoned tofu on a bed of cooked cabbage. Not exactly the vegtables I was thinking of. The reasons they do get 2 stars is their service is amazing, their teriyaki sauce is amazing, and the restaurant was clean! PS- I was rather upset though one time I went in on one of their big screen tvs they had some show about \"top fights and crashes\" it was a tad bit gruesome to see peoples arms break and bones stick out while I was eating my overpriced food."}
{"text":"We decided to try Teriyaki Madness for the first time. We got there when they opened and walked in and could see the two workers. I went to the bathroom and came back out and my husband was still standing at the counter. No one acknowledged us at all. First impressions matter! We walked out and went someplace else to eat. Not giving them another chance."}
{"text":"I like this place. The servings are large. Spicy Chicken was the best plate I've had here.  The plate was enough to feed 2 people so we were quite happy. Food took a little while, but it's cooked fresh. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good chicken bowl in the Vegas area after a nice hike. The steamed veggies are cooked to perfection . the chicken for the chicken breast plate is real close to being dry. Place is very clean and the staff is great."}
{"text":"The chicken was chewy, undercooked and drenched in way too much sauce. The veggies consisted of several pieces of cabbage and nothing else."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were very satisfying. I've only tried the chicken teriyaki with vegetables and brown rice. The chicken is very tender and not dry. The teriyaki sauce they pour over the chicken is not too thick and has the perfect level of consistency and richness. There's really not a lot to say other than to try this place if you're looking for a good teriyaki place! Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Good service with friendly employees. The serving sizes are plenty and the food is tasty!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to location but over the last year the prices keep going up and the kids bowls no longer come with drink included (it still does at all other locations I go to). And every time I would try to phone in an order you were put on hold, every time, regardless of what time I called. Usually for a minute or longer. The food is still good but the rising prices and lack of time management forces me to drive to further locations."}
{"text":"Spicy Chicken bowl is my all time favorite here, it's what I get every time that I am here, and I'm never disappointed with the flavor it provides. The business itself is very clean with a medium ambiance level, not enough to actually annoy you. They take awhile to provide the food you order almost every time, whether it be crowded or empty, but that could be out of their hands. The food itself is always great, flavorful, spicy and in a sense can be healthy. I love coming here if I'm in need of food urgently."}
{"text":"Great food, pricing and staff!! I always get the Crab Rangoons and the chicken teriyaki bowl! So yummy!! Love this place! Plus you can't beat the 20% off when you check in!!"}
{"text":"Chicken tastes like rubber. Wouldn't order the chicken teriyaki even as a joke for my worst enemy."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to a Teriyaki Madness, Not a bad lunch. I had a Chicken Teriyaki bowl. The vegetables were fresh and cooked perfectly. The chicken was defiantly pre-cooked but tasty not drowned in sauce. The noddles were rubbery and a little strange. I will give them another try hold the noodles."}
{"text":"We tried this place as we noticed it was recently opened.  Egg Rolls greasy; noodles bland.  I liked the beef teriyaki but the chicken could be much better.  The portions were fair for the price but no WOW factor with this place."}
{"text":"Got the worse food poisoning of my life here! Seriously thought I was gonna die!"}
{"text":"I tried their vegan tofu and brown rice bowl and it was like heaven in my mouth! The tofu was perfectly spiced and fried to where it didn't really taste like tofu! Will definitely be getting this bowl again!"}
{"text":"So, I've been here a couple times in the past and it was always just okay. A consistent mediocre experience has inspired me to make a Yelp account & start informing people of these since I am a constant eater. Let's start with what we ordered:  FOR HER: I got the TERIYAKI BEEF, which was relatively good. Definitely smaller portions than I remember them serving though. Still found myself hungry afterwards, but wasn't about to spend more money than what we had already spent.  FOR HIM: My boyfriend got the ORANGE CHICKEN, and opted for the plate instead of the bowl -- but it seemed that the portion was the same amount as the bowl. The orange chicken pieces were small & a little too crunchy he said (I've never heard him say that before, which says a lot).   Overall, portions did not match the prices... and we won't be returning to eat here."}
{"text":"Went with my family to have lunch yesterday and service was ok but food was not , we ordered spicy beef , teriyaki beef , regular beef , teriyaki chicken, orange chicken and spicy chicken well all the beef sides were burnt and I mean black burnt and they put way too much sauce I'm assuming to take the burnt flavor off , we didn't complain but I will not be back to this location , I'll rather drive further to horizon ridge."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited friends in town and decided to try this place for lunch..I must mention that they were really busy.. However the friendly cashier took her time explaining the menu and how the ordering works. We had the chicken potstickers, chicken katsu (which was the bomb!!!!) and beef teriyaki (extremely tender).. I am very happy that we decided to eat here. We will definitely be back when in the area.."}
{"text":"I've been to the Mesa location and now this location. I had the chicken breast, veggies and brown rice. Juicy, grilled chicken breast fresh and crispy vegetables..yes!!! The girl at the front was cheerful and super friendly. If you don't have enough time to eat; can call ahead too.. This is food made to order..it will take a little time."}
{"text":"This location portions are terrible. They are nothing like the other teriyaki madness.  they gave me a black box with veggies, my veggies weren't even filled up half way. I ordered a bowl of the spicy chicken with noodles. my spicy chicken and my noodles didn't even fill up half of my ball. When I called and asked them why was so little they told me that they have different portion sizes from the other teriyaki manners DO NOT GO THERE &  waste your money! get more for your buck at other ones."}
{"text":"Came here after the gym and I must say the food is delicious!! Their low carb plate is amazing!! I will definitely be coming back to this location for more food!! Shout out to dean!!! He is awesome :)"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday. Not sure what I was expecting but it's pretty much fast food without a drive through. The food was okay and so was the service. It's not as clean as I would like, but it's also priced cheaply. Once in a while I'm sure it's okay, but I wouldn't eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! I drove across town after placing an order & the girl repeated order back to me. I got there & she over charged me & then told me I'd have to wait for my food that came up because they were making me a different 1 with less. She was Completely rude & embarrassed the cashier that completely understood me. I left without my food & will not come back again."}
{"text":"Never had an issue until tonight. Ordered a bowl with white rice. Get home to find out the rice was cooked with way too much water and was mushy and inedible. I called to let them know and all they said was they were sorry. I let him know I felt like it was wasted money to only be able to eat the chicken and little bit of veggies on top and all he offered was 10% off my next order. Really?! After this experience I will not be going back! How does a place that serves food that mostly includes rice mess up the rice?! Get it together guys!"}
{"text":"Pricey food and I can't figure out why I paid so much to get heartburn...  customer service is good. The place was empty when I went. Veggies were good as well as the chicken but again pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"This is by far the best teriyaki place in town. The portions are huge, the food tastes great, and I've been coming to teriyaki madness since the place opened its first franchise in Las Vegas about 15 years ago. When I moved to Phoenix 1.5 years ago I was thrilled to see that they had expanded their locations to include the Phoenix market. I would love to see more locations!"}
{"text":"I liked that they had the option of chicken and chicken breast! But, I didn't care for their teriyaki sauce that much :/ overall a nice location... clean and  friendly workers!"}
{"text":"Had a great teriyaki chicken bowl. Veggies were nicely cooked, had some wok taste and were crunchy, the chicken was tender and seasoned well. I was there on a Saturday just before noon so it wasn't crowded at all. Would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Entertainment book 2012 has a BOGO up to 7 buckaroos.... and thats basically the best part of it.   I didn't think the meat had a lot a flavor and to top it off, the guy at the register was grumpy and I didn't feel that welcoming feeling like other places."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible customer service. The girl is standing in the back joking & having a conversation with another employee which is eating. I tell her it's for here & she brings it out with no fork. I ask for a for & she says it's over there! Get it yourself! Food good but customer service is pretty bad. At least when I get it to go they put a fork in your bag! As I'm not even offered a drink & I sit & watch her not offer others a drink or anything else! I would have ordered a drink & a side easily if asked. Now other customers are asking if they can get a drink after the matter."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great flavor, great selection, and great service! Usually pretty busy but the young lady at the register by herself handles it amazing and is awesome! Love the healthy choices!   My boyfriend is always torn between two choices and tonight we realized there's a two protein option, so he got to try both the beef teriyaki and spicy chick. He raved about both. Also got the half and half. Noddle and rice.   The register gal also asked if I wanted my veggies steamed or stir fried which I super appreciate since I am more health conscious than my boyfriend.   Thanks teriyaki madness, see ya soon!"}
{"text":"It's a solid chicken teriyaki bowl. What else can I say. Call ahead of time so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to Teriyaki bowls but I came in because it was close to my sons ortho and we decided to try it. I'm so glad we went in because our food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Awful, 45 minute wait for expensive yet disgusting food. Worst friend rice i have ever had, it was mush. When your order noodles it just noodles and chicken, veggies are extra"}
{"text":"Customer service is amzaing! Once you enter in you get welcomed right away which is a great start. My food order didn't even take like other place I've been to. Now once I come to this side of town I'll look foward coming here to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you want juicy, tender, and flavorful Chicken Teriyaki. Initially I ordered my meal as a take-out. The wait isn't that long and the meal is cooked hot and fresh with quality ingredients. When they delivered the takeout order to my table, I'm thinking I'd probably be better off just dining in because I am super hungry.   I chose the Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) with Brown Rice and Stir-Fry Veggies. Also I got an order of Chicken Yakisoba ($7.99) and Unsweetened Iced Tea ($1.99). The quantity portions of meat and veggies are so worth the price. However I do wish they had given a little more brown rice to enjoy with the Chicken Teriyaki. Now with the Chicken Yakisoba, my only concern is that the noodles were lacking flavor. I had to request the thick Teriyaki sauce to mix into the noodles and make it taste better. As a result, the thick sauce did make the meal more enjoyable.   What I am most happy is how family-oriented the service is. There is a kind and elderly gentleman who is always looking out for the customer. He makes sure the restaurant is tidy and clean, and he goes above and beyond in hospitality. It's like having your grandfather there taking good care of you. The commitment and dedication that he and the team provide to the customers really does shine with excellence at this location."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken bowl is my favorite with the sauce soaking into the rice!  Always enjoying the yakisoba.  And their Chicken Katsu, can't be beat or can it!  And the Hawaiian fruit punch is a great addition.   The cashiers always smiling, with great service!"}
{"text":"I gotta say...for quick fresh Asian food on the go, this my my spot!  Always good quality and you get a lot for your dollar.  Great kids menu options too!"}
{"text":"Poor quality chicken. Looks like shredded white meat. Soggy noodles. Food arrived via UberEats.  Missing 1 chicken bowl. Chicken plate was missing vegetables. I would give 0 stars if it was an option. Maybe next time use dark meat chicken. Noodles made 5 days before delivery probably not the best option. I called the Teriyaki Madness and they fessed up to their mistake but asked me to drive to them to pick up my food. 15 minute drive to pick up waaaaay sub-par \"Asian Fusion\". I gave them 1 star because pot stickers were OK. I think the restaurant in Phoenix that serves cat vomit got 2 stars."}
{"text":"Healthier choice for a quick and easy lunch/dinner. I do always get the same thing - chicken teriyaki rice bowl with veggies! Can't go wrong and better option over fast food. Teriyaki Madness is always clean, staff is nice and plenty of seating! Good vibe!"}
{"text":"Since posting the last review my opinion has changed. They seemed to have gone bet corporate.  And my #1 thing that I like which was the crab Rangoon has changed suppliers and now they are tough and hard to chew.  They have no flavor like before."}
{"text":"My favorite post workout place! Food and service are always great, and they're faster than the other locations too."}
{"text":"I love the spicy chicken plate! Always get it with vegetables no rice. My complaint is it was not deboned well, I kept biting into bones with every bite. Otherwise it was good and tasty"}
{"text":"This place is down the street from our house so the bf & I come here a couple times a month.  The service here is super friendly. The employees are always smiling & seem genuinely happy to be working here.   The food is pretty good. I'm simple- I just get a chicken teriyaki bowl with white rice. The portions are pretty big so I always have leftovers.   No complaints here"}
{"text":"Been here many times had their spicy chicken teriyaki bowl I would recommend this to anybody"}
{"text":"Foods is excellent and friendly services and fast services clean and no waiting and is walking distance."}
{"text":"Good price, Great customer service and great food. First time here and we have two little kids. Karen recommend that we have the kids split a bowl. It would be a little cheaper and come out to be the same size are the kids bowl. On top of that she had a coupon for a free bowl. She gave it to us."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and I was looking for something that would replace my love for Samurai Sam's since there's not one very close by. I submitted an online order for pickup and my order was ready when I got there. I got the chicken yakisoba bowl as well as an egg roll. The bowl is HUGE! I'll easily get 2-3 meals out of it. The chicken is cooked perfectly and there was a great variety of veggies. My only gripe would be that I asked for extra \"thick sauce\" and I'm not sure if I got it or not.. if that was thick, I'd hate to see how runny the regular is! Still decent flavor nonetheless. The egg roll and the sauce it came with was delish! Although the meal was tasty, I still prefer Samurai Sam's, unfortunately. I was really hoping they'd kill it!"}
{"text":"I Really dont understand why some people are so crazy about this place..its pretty eek if you ask me...Im a teriyak fan so I gave it a try...and umm..yeah no. I per fer Teriyaki Stop"}
{"text":"This location is a regular stop for me when trying to eat on the healthy side. What I've noticed lately, and the reason that prompted me to post a review finally, is that the staff is always friendly, efficient and the quality of my chicken breast bowls/veggies has been consistently good. This location always seems to have a steady flow of business type customers, yet there is never a very long wait for food. I usally get my food to go, but when I have stayed to eat, I've noticed the dining room tends to be slightly dirty. It's not terrible, but because of the amount of traffic, more attention to wiping the tables and a mid day floor mopping or sweeping would be a good thing for a restaurant that obviously tries hard already."}
{"text":"I almost feel like Teriyaki Madness read my review! +1 star for updating their menu to a very customer friendly format. I believe brown rice is actually the same price as white rice now also!"}
{"text":"Addicting to say the least. My coworkers and I could survive on Teriyaki Madness alone. I don't even know where to behind in describing the goodness of this food! All I can REALLY say is you have to try it for yourself! It's a pain getting out of the shopping center and back onto Stephanie heading north bit well worth it. K.... Gotta eat now!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out of teriyaki chicken. It was average quality. Also the wait time here is longer than other take out places offering teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"My favorite location out of all the ones I've been to. They keep it nice and cool inside during the summer, unlike the one on Maryland and Silverado Ranch (Maybe their AC was broken the time I was at that location). Their spicy chicken bowls are to DIE FOR. Put some extra Sriracha and you have a mouthful of spicy wonderfulness. Veggies always taste nice and fresh and their brown rice is delish also. Servings are HUGE. I can order a bowl and eat it for lunch and dinner. They also have options for the little ones in terms of smaller sized plain bowls."}
{"text":"Actually better than good, this is the new one across 215 from Costco.  Have eaten several times at Centennial and is also good.    The only problem was when i got home it was the wrong order, chicken vs beef teriyaki."}
{"text":"First time here, and I wasn't disappointed.  The servings were a good size, lil pricey but, tasted good. I had the chicken potstickers, and chicken teriyaki with veggies.  The person at the register, he was very friendly."}
{"text":"Madness is the best.   Spicy chicken bowl kicks ass.  Most of the employees know us and are super friendly and some are just not very happy to be there."}
{"text":"Look don't get me wrong for giving them onlyb2 stars... Maybe I should have given them only one start. Here's why, the food was delicious, I ordered the chicken best teriyaki with noodle. I enjoy the food was delicious, however the 2 star is because the lady at the counter doesn't make you feel welcoming to this place. She was not rude but she was not nice. No smile, no hi, no thank you.... I'm my book this is a no no.... Will I go to this place again??? Maybe.... Maybe not."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Nice clean atmosphere and excellent customer service, the food is always fresh and my favorite was the combination chicken/beef with veggies :-)) I recommend!"}
{"text":"I get the same thing here for years....Orange chicken bowl w/brown rice...Yes I am addicted...I took away 1 star because they took the pictures off the wall...Really...It's very plain in their...As well as the floor is a safety hazard, and sometimes appears dirty..."}
{"text":"I work at 24hr Fitness and love the fact that they have healthy alternatives!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the food takes a bit so order ahead if on a lunch break. Overall a solid place for teriyaki"}
{"text":"My go to place when things gets hectic at work and don't feel like cooking. Always have a choice either brown rice or veggies only with your protein... pick your poison."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a good chix teriyaki. I come here often and sometimes to go. I can have this niece a week"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THE SCAM & THE LIAR FLYER!! They advertise a Power Bowl that is shown as having more chicken than the regular bowl, but it's a lie. It has the same amount of chicken as ordering the regular bowl. Stop showing misleading false advertising to the customers. Even if you order it with just veggies exactly like the in-restaurant flyer shows IT'S AN ADVERTISING LIE!!   Then when you bring it to their attention they act stuck on stupid and tell you you're going to have to pay more for the amount of chicken shown on THE LIAR FLYER!!! LOL.  BEWARE OF THE SCAM!!"}
{"text":"The spicy chicken and stir-fried vegetables were great. I will definitely be back for more of that!!"}
{"text":"In the front door it's says the food is addicting and it sure is. Great take out for anyone that lives in the southwest area, the food here is very solid quality."}
{"text":"Lean chicken, fresh veggies and brown rice available along with quick service and a great price.  I go here two times a week easily and the tempura shrimp is my favorite app"}
{"text":"I love coming to this one in particular. Reason being, the cashier Abril is so polite and extremely friendly. She brightens this restaurant. Promote her or give her a rise!  Food; all ways fresh and tastes astonishing."}
{"text":"Last night, I went to this location about a half hour before close as I had just gotten off work. I ordered a teriyaki plate with chicken and beef. It took well over 20 mins to get my food, but I wasn't bothered by that as there were two people ahead of me and someone with a pretty sizable phone order. What bothers me is when I have to call out at my job because my body went DEFCON 5 on the food I paid you for. I was up all night having episodes of cold sweats, explosive diarrhea and projectile vomit (all at the same time BTW). Once I had completely cleared my body of all that after an 8 to 10 hour fierce battle, I'm left bedridden today with severe cramping and frequent urges to go to the restroom. Tried multiple times to give this location benefit of the doubt but after this, they've lost my patronage. And I am 100% that it was their food that jacked me up. There's a huge bag of regurgitated teriyaki in the trash I've yet to have the strength to throw out. So, I can't say for other teriyaki madness locations but this one is no bueno. If you want projectile fluids coming out of both ends, take a gamble on this place."}
{"text":"Simple, good food. This place is always busy yet I always get friendly service and the food is consistently good and fresh. I always ask for the sauce on the side and they don't give me any grief for it or try to upcharge me or whatever. I usually get the bowl but sometimes order the meal and split it with my husband 'cos the portions are very generous. It's right off the 215 & Stephanie so it's an easy location."}
{"text":"I usually love coming to this location. But as time went on, I noticed their staff has become more and more unprofessional and they've become stingier on the servings they give. For example, my friend and I went last night and he ordered a orange chicken plate with half spicy chicken and all noodles. We got a orange chicken bowl, with less noodles than the kids size and spicy chicken no where to be found. Not the mention the cashiers didn't really know the menu or how much to charge. But I give them the benefit of the doubt being young. I still enjoy the food, maybe at a different location."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. Pretty good and the employees were friendly. We did have a discrepancy with our order but it was handled professionally and quickly no longer an issue. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Coming from SoCal I was in love wit Waba Grill. Being that there isn't any here in Vegas yet, teriyaki madness is the closest thing! They have a decent selection when it comes to proteins then you can opt for low carb, rice, or brown rice. Good food good service and no complaints. Healthy gainz!"}
{"text":"I usually am excited to enjoy the spicy teriyaki chicken,brown rice and \"wonderful\"side salad. This time it ended up with disappointment. I opened up my side salad to find that the dressing is almost empty and the lettuce had been frozen. If you know anything about lettuce and freezing it you know if they do not go together.    The chicken did have good teriyaki flavor and as I like it with a little spice. They do supply you with a good portion of rice and chicken.  I am sure that I will be back but I might not get the salad the next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just ate here tonight for the first time and now we both feel ill. We both ordered the Chicken Teriyaki bowl.  The actual restaurant area was new and clean. Lighting is oddly bright like a spotlight over your head. Probably won't eat here again. Plus it was very expensive. I honestly prefer Samari Sams."}
{"text":"This place is worth it. The spicy chicken teriyaki with fried rice and veggies taste amazing. I also recommend the orange chicken. Yum yum. There's a party in my tummy when I eat it."}
{"text":"TMAD!!! Best teriyaki place in town. I've been to multiple TMAD locations but this one tops them all!! Spaces and clean, with top notch service that will compete with the best steakhouses in town. Yup I said it!  When you call to place a \"to-go\" order, the plug your number into some system and answer saying your name then ask if you would like to place the same order as last time!! It's so amazing and so convenient especially when your order isn't easy. I wish I knew the name of the guy working the front because he deserves a shout out (young blonde guy mid 20s). Well back to my orange chicken combo plate, it's too damn good!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go to the blue diamond location. The food is bland and undercooked. The Maryland location has been a favorite of ours, but when we tried the Blue Diamond location it was awful !!! Spend the gas and go to the Maryland location !"}
{"text":"First time at Teriyaki Madness and the service and food was great! Favorite is the Yakisoba with beef and veggies. Think we've found a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Very clean, great service and not to mention the food was really fresh and good. The teriyaki sauce is also a plus in each table with some sriracaha"}
{"text":"Used to be our favorite go to spot for a quick dinner after work, but starting to think otherwise.   We used to order once, if not twice, a week on the way home from work, but my fiance hadn't been feeling it for the past month. I never asked her why, just figured maybe it was too much of a good thing, as the spicy chicken bowl is awesome. So last night I call in the order so that I can pick it up on the way home, per the usual. When I arrive, the girl who took the order over the phone also rang me up, as there was no other girl in the building. She brings out what looks to be 3 to go orders, one of which looks to me like 2 Spicy Chicken bowls, and sets them on the counter near the cooks. At the time, only another walk-in couple had ordered and nobody else was there. After about 5 minutes, a family comes in and she takes their order as the guy filling the sauce calls for the walk-in couple to give them their order.   Seeing as they ordered their meal after I paid for my call in order, I thought something was awry. The guy looked at me and asked for my name, which I gave him, and he handed me the bag that had been just sitting there for 5 minutes, which she could have just handed me as she walked out. Since we are still a ways from the location, by the time I got home, the food was luke warm at best. I begin to tell my fiance about my experience and before I can finish, she tells me the reason she hadn't wanted TM was because she experienced the exact same thing. Same girl, same food on the counter that she could have just handed over seeing as she both took the order and rang it up upon arrival, same luke warm chicken bowls and all. Turns out the reason she wasn't wanting TM wasn't because she didn't like the food anymore, but because seeing your food sit there and nobody so much as calling out the order is plain frustrating.   Had she not told me that she had experienced the exact same thing, I wouldn't have thought twice about it, maybe just a one off bad experience. But the same thing, same person, same place tells me there is something wrong. With the opening of a number of new places in the area due to the Waterpark opening, I'm sure we can find another go to spot for a quick dinner pick up, which sucks since the food is great."}
{"text":"My new Go To Place for a Teriyaki Bowl!   This place beats out Flame Broiler.  Great Customer service and greets upon entering the establishment.  They have so many protein options; Salmon, Spicy Chicken, Beef Teriyaki and of course Chicken Teriyaki.  Let's not Stop there, they have Brown, white & FRIED RICE!   Endless. They offer avocado for an additional price.  Veggies are included and they are cabbage, carrots, zucchini, onions and broccoli. Very good and they don't do an overkill of the veggies.   Prices are moderate. Spent $25 for 2 regular and 1 JR bowl.  Sizes are a great portion size as well. Wait until you see the large bowl, it can feed at least 2 people !   Parking is available and seating available inside.  Definitely will be returning.   Accepts credit/debit cards & cash."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on recommendation of a friend and I was impressed.. Super generous portions and fresh ingredients. Love that they have brown rice and they do brown rice right. I got the spicy chicken teriyaki and it had a nice level of heat without being too spicy. Tables have sriracha hot sauce if you want to kick it up a notch and teriyaki sauce I you want things a little sweeter -- but what came out of the kitchen was perfect to me. Another thing that impressed was how well the chicken was cut and cooked. Juicy and tender with just enough crisp edges to have each bite good texture. Additionally, my large serving of chicken didn't have a single bit of fat, skin or tendon -- something that frequently takes away from the enjoyment of any chicken teriyaki dish. IMHO shows great attention to detail. Highly recommended if you are in the mood for a tasty plate of food."}
{"text":"Asian fusion restaurants usuallly charge a premium, but I thought teriyaki madness catered to many of us that like to stay in a smaller range for a quick bite. Food was pretty good and staff was friendly. The spicy beef is great!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, really good food, decent price and a nice upbeat environment. If you looking for something good and different, this is the place to go. Ive been here a few times and this won't be my last."}
{"text":"Very good teriyaki!  Its clean, ok the quiet side, which I like, and comfortable.  My family and i enjoyed it.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I can't f*ck with y'all anymore.  You've messed up my order far too many times.  Don't worry though, your food is straight and so I'll just go to another nearby location.  But jeez, get the orders right and put everything that I ordered in the f'n bag!  C'mon man!"}
{"text":"(Visit: 07.24.16, 3:30pm)  I would probably give the food more stars but ummm, they didn't even give me all of the food (to-go) that I ordered.    It was my first time at this place and again, although the food was pretty good, I'll never go to this specific location because of my experience with the jerk-off cashier that I had to deal with.  It must have been this clown's worst day.  Either way, I will never go to this location again... Damn, I should have took his name down."}
{"text":"Bleh.  Overpriced for a teriyaki bowl and a drink.  Total is $11+.  It's close to work and this place is new so I gave it a try.  I won't be back if not for the free bowl coupon.  If I am craving for chicken and rice I will just go across the street to House of Leng."}
{"text":"I have been to many TMads across the valley, but this one, by far has the best customer service. Food is always delicious,  its definitely a family fave."}
{"text":"Received a coupon in my email stating \"2 bowls for $12\". The coupon stated that they had to be chicken, however it did not state that no alterations to the order could be made. When we arrived, we presented the coupon and ordered two spicy chicken bowls- one with noodles and only broccoli and the other with brown rice and broccoli and zucchini. Plus two drinks. The total came to $20 and some change. Had we ordered regular bowls, customized the way we would like, it would have come out to $23. So the coupon saved us $3 when the coupon led us to believed we would be spending around $12 for our meals. We asked why it became so expensive and they stated it was because we had to order the standard bowl with no alterations. Because we didn't, they up charged us .50 cents-$1 for each change. We asked where on the coupon it explained that and she said it didn't have to say it and that it was how it was. We asked to speak to a manager because she was unable to explain it better. The employee said the manager was unavailable. So we escalated it to ask for the owner. They called the owner only for him to say that unfortunately the coupons were not accurate but that he would not honor the coupon regardless of the situation. Poor customer service and the two employees had no idea how to explain to us the coupon policy, other than to offer us the options for changes on the bowls but then charge us in the end without letting us know prior.   Only two customers in the restaurant..i wonder why."}
{"text":"Don't go to the blue diamond location. The food is bland and undercooked. The Maryland location has been a favorite of ours, but when we tried the Blue Diamond location it was awful !!! Spend the gas and go to the Maryland location !"}
{"text":"I can't say teriyaki bowls are something I crave- but Teriyaki Madness  does them well. Get the regular chicken bowl with veggies and brown rice, add on a drizzle of sriracha, and you've got a solid lunch or dinner with good macros (31P/73C/9F) and a huge portion that could satisfy the Hulk.  This location is new and seems to blend in despite the signage- same building as Starbucks, with patio seating. Menu is fairly limited but I never get anything but the order above. If you get takeout be sure to ask for their Sriracha packets, since they're kept behind the counter."}
{"text":"After reading some of these reviews I must be living in some sort of parallel universe because this place is awesome. Stopped by (twice) on a golf trip with buddies and we all loved it-healthy, cooked to order, fairly priced and clean. I don't think this place was ever meant to compete with fancy sushi/japanese restaurants (we have lots in SF, which, by the way, have mostly gone downhill).   Will definitely be back next March when I'm in town for Spring Training. Hopefully one will open up in the meantime in the Bay Area!  One last thing: I think about the Spicy Chicken all the time, especially when when I'm on the road passing one crummy fast food joint after another..."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness is SUPER YUMMY! Reasonably priced and fast! I would recommend this place to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Super close to my house and so good! I recommend calling ahead and placing an order as there is always a wait and the store is tiny. The spicy chicken is the best! I usually get all veggies and chicken and skip on the rice. Also add a bunch of siracha!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted so good and the bowls have so much in them! Definitely gonna keep going back!"}
{"text":"If you have to settle for cheap, mediocre teriyaki then I would suggest one of the many Yogis.  A lot left to be desired.  Too bad it takes up such a prime location too."}
{"text":"It seems like the quality of their chicken has gone down. I've been going to teriyaki madness since probably 2013. This location seems to always have something wrong with my orders. I walked in and asked for 2 Jr teriyaki bowls. Both chicken breast. I get home and start eating one (I'm not even a mile away from this location)  my chicken is barely even hot and it simple can NOT be chicken breast... It had so much fat on it and was SO chewy... Gross... Not going back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I even have them a 2nd then 3rd chance. Calling in the order was a nightmare, girl talking to 3 people at 1 time phone rang forever. Could not even read the order back, and on top of that when I got there to pick up the food it was wrong. I love there food! To bad that was my last time there ever!!!"}
{"text":"This Orange Chicken is the best. Truly a great place to order from and the delivery person was great. I will truly be ordering from this restaurant again. The best."}
{"text":"Stopped in before the the who watching carbs thing started in my diet.  Teriyaki Madness is a solid option when it comes to healthy fast-food unless your monitoring some macros.  Service here was friendly and my chicken bowl was made in quick order.  If in the area, I would absolutely visit again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. I always order the spicy chicken bowl. It comes with good amount of flavorful spicy chicken, rice, and vegetables.  Sometimes I feel like making it even spicier so I add Sriracha sauce.    The place it self always looks clean to me, big and empty and maybe a couple other customer..."}
{"text":"It's been one year since my first visit and review.  What a wonderful turn around.....The Power Road location has now become one of our regular \"go to\" and \"take out\" places.  The quality, ambiance and staff have made this place very inviting.  The quantity of food for the money is always great.  You never leave hungry and many times leave with a container of left overs.  Highly recommended - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating my chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies.  For $6.99 I got a  big portion for the size of the bowl.   Went in there for lunch and got greeted by the friendly cashier and she suggested exactly what I wanted.   It was very clean and service is prompt, especially because I was on a short lunch break.     I will be back and looking forward to trying other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Best location to get teriyaki madness! Me and my co workers are regulars, seriously very addicting! If you love spicy food get a spicy chicken bowl. Staff are friendly and the food service/customer is great. Doesn't take long so if you are grabbing lunch come to this location. Roberto is seriously the best manager  keep it pushing guys. Thank you for your great service. It's a great pleasure eating there."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and a good menu with healthy choices. Perfect for a quick lunch. The cashiers usually remember my name which is just rare these days. I always get the Low Carb spicy chicken plate with extra chicken. There's free wifi and free refills on drinks. My fiancé gets a big bowl of steamed veggies. Everything is cooked to order so it's always fresh. You can also call in an order to pick up."}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to this place, the food is good, however I am a little disappointed with the service, the cashier was rude."}
{"text":"Yummy food after a workout mmmm!  Spicy chicken is amazing!!  Also low carb plate with chicken is awesome!  Make sure you tell them you want all white meat!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time since I moved to the area. Heather the cashier was awesome! She was very nice and polite and I love that! The food was done in about 5-7 minutes and very delicious. I will be returning :)"}
{"text":"I went to Teriyaki Madness after a workout.  It's in the same shopping center/strip mall as my 24 Hour Fitness, so it's in a great location for those wanting to scarf down some protein and/or carbs.  I was kind of skeptical because it's not Samurai Sam's (the best teriyaki chicken bowl place on the planet imho) but the windows displayed those \"voted best in las vegas\" signs, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  Service is what you would expect from the guy who's just there to work the register - pretty non-existent.  You just walk up to the counter, give your name, your order, pay and go sit down.  I got the chicken breast teriyaki bowl.  This comes with LOTS of chicken, steamed white rice and teriyaki sauce.   That's it.  I also picked up a bottle of Powerade Option, the availability of which was a pleasant surprise.  The total came to just over 8 bucks.  There was also the minor annoyance of a 35-cent surcharge to use my debit card.  After waiting what seemed like nearly 10 minutes for my order, I finally got a chance to eat.  First of all, they put next to no teriyaki sauce on my bowl.  Just barely enough to dampen the chicken.  I actually had to use soy sauce later on with my remaining rice the teriyaki was so scarce.  The chicken seemed genuinely cooked as the exterior was downright crispy during some bites.  But once you got down to business, it was quite rubbery.  Not good.  Odds and ends:  The place is relatively small.  Just a few tables surrounded by barstool/wall counter seating.  Plenty of reading material such as the Las Vegas Weekly to keep your mind occupied as the food is cooked.  Oh, and big ups to selling Powerade Option.  A con that's certainly not exclusive to Teriyaki Madness is those debit card receipts that ask you to put down a tip.  I feel guilty not giving one, even though it's for service that doesn't deserve it.  But I digress.  All in all, I'm sticking to Samurai Sam's for my teriyaki fix.  I wouldn't return to this place unless I was starving and the Subway next door was closed."}
{"text":"Combo plates will definitely fill your appetite. The prices are very reasonable. There wasnt anything amazing about the place but nothing really bad. I will say that the mac salad wasnt that good atleast compared to hawaiian places..but they give u choices of salad greens, veggies, or mac salad with entrees. Came here during lunch and they were busy...had the beef/pork teriyaki combo w/ noodles/fried rice, which was very filling. Service was fast and place was clean."}
{"text":"Place was cute and cozy-looked clean, service was great, and the food was made to order. We ordered beef teriyaki, spicy chicken teriyaki, and orange chicken, all with white rice. I can honestly say Panda Express is better! The beef was dry and over spiced with garlic and I had to put my own teriyaki sauce on it and mix it, the spicy chicken was dry, and the orange chicken was over cooked and soggy. The rice was very wet and mushy, as if they put too much water in it. I will give it another try as maybe the cooks that day were having a bad day??? The food was edible but it's fast food so what should I expect right?"}
{"text":"Food is awesome always , however, customer service is not the best . I truly enjoy going to places where they have personality . We work hard for are money and if we pick your location for a service there is a reason behind it .   The location is always busy and the food is always fresh and hot . Location is pricey but, you truly get what you pay for ."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very very good ....ive been there mutiple times and never a dissipointment i usually get the spicy beef or chicken bowl and steamed vegetables sooo good =)  honestly ive really never eaten inside but it seems nice always take out...."}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing. I recently just moved here from WA state where there are really fantastic teriyaki places everywhere so i've been looking for my fix. I think i have found it.  I've only had their spicy and orange chicken but both are amazing. Also, their pot stickers and both fried and brown rice are always cooked perfect. Highly recommend this place. The staff are always pleasant to talk to also."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for a fast food place. Service was great too! I had the special salmon teriyaki and potstickers and both were really good! Veggies were cooked perfect and tasty!"}
{"text":"Went in and it was so clean! Honestly haven't seen a joint in mesa that clean in a while... (especially the bathrooms they were practically spotless!) Ask to talk to the manager hailey I think her name was and let her know she was doing a great job. Definitely someone I would want to run my store."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Madness in town. It wins me over with the atmosphere, the employees and the delicious fresh food. My boyfriend gets the regular chicken teriyaki plate and I get the breast plate for about almost $10 each. The chicken is nice and tender normally I am picky about it but at this place it's just right and not too rubbery. You get to choose between what kind of rice or if you want the veggies/mac salad with your plate, if you want the veggies but no cabbage then just ask for zucchini an broccoli. The employees help out because they make you feel welcomed and they always surprise me because a few actually remember my order. Overall I love everything about this place and will continue coming back."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious! Their teriyaki sauce is great, their rice has always been good, and they have a nice side menu! They cater to vegetarian people, and have many options for different eating habits.  However, the real madness is the prices. $10 for a plate is pushing it too far considering the amount of locations they have.   Is the madness worth multiple visits? That will be up to you, there are multiple places that offer good teriyaki with lower prices with the same amount of food."}
{"text":"I've learned to get the pork only. It's the only good meat here.  The gyoza are good, the egg rolls are good, some locations have rangoons and those are good as well (I don't think the Stephanie location has them).  Get the NOODLES with PORK. That's the only way to go.  Otherwise, it's just a little place with some featured art on the walls. The food is decent and some things are a little expensive."}
{"text":"ONLY Teriyaki Madness I'll go to! Portions are big, food looks like what it's suppose to look like, and it's on the healthier side! Stir fried veggies with tofu & chicken is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Just finished a workout at 24 Hour Fitness right across from Teriyaki Madness, so I decided to stop in to grab a quick lunch before work. The cashier looked miserable and didn't seem like he wanted to help me. I ignored that and decided to order a chicken teriyaki bowl. There was nothing wrong with it, but there was nothing great about it either. Also, I think $8+ for that bowl is not worth it. I've had better for cheaper, aka Samurai Sam's. I'll stick to my usual spot instead."}
{"text":"I was hooping with all the hype I had heard that I'd like this place better. I just thought it was okay. I had the spicy beef teriyaki and the portion was good but the beef didn't taste spicy and the teriyaki flavor was just too much. The beef wasn't fatty which was nice but man that teriyaki stood out too much. I had some of the chicken pot stickers and they were greasy. I know Panda Express is \"fast food\" but I like it there better and at least for the same price I get to choose different options and have variety on my plate. The workers were nice and it was clean inside."}
{"text":"This is the worse food I have ever had at any of the teriaky madness restaurants. I frequent this food chain and have never felt let down with the freshness, taste and quality of the food until I purchased a chicken and veggie bowl from this location.  The chicken looked and tasted like it had been boiled, refrigerated then grilled.  It was so though I think I burned all the calories the bowl consisted of trying to chew the hockey puck chicken.  My husband's food was the same, he received a flavorless dried out beef bowl. I couldn't finish my chicken as my jaw started to lock up from eating this meal. I do not recommend you come to this location if you are expecting the same quality as the other Teriaky Madness restaurants."}
{"text":"So I'm a teriyaki madness addict. I've been coming here for awhile and I love it - I'm pretty sure I've had everything on the menu. Now I'm on a health kick and get spicy chicken teriyaki and veggies, (sometimes with rice, sometimes not) pretty much every time. I have never had a problem with their food or their service. Everything is always cooked right (I hate over cooked rice and veggies so much and that has never happened here, thank you TM gods). Crab rangoons are so dang good. Salmon is not my fave but it's probably someone else's. Noodles and fried rice are good, they're a $1 up charge. I recommend getting the bowl, plates are so freaking big.   The place is always super clean even when they're crazy busy and again for faster food this is super good. Employees are so so so nice.   This place deserves 5/5 :)"}
{"text":"Only gave me maybe 5 pieces of chicken and filled the rest with noddles. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Great food great service. I typically call my order in and pick it up and they are very good about having your order ready. My favorite is the spicy chicken teriyaki plate and I add some extra sauce. I prefer their brown rice over the white rice.  Portion size is great even for the bowl size which is not much smaller than the plate.  Sometimes I feel spicy and I will ask them to make it extra spicy!  they are right off to 15 and Stephanie so it is very easy to get to. If I know I am traveling on the 215 I will call my order in and pick it up very easy."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of L and L BBQ and any other Asian Fusion Teriyaki BBQ. It's about the same pricing with heavy proportions and more options to choose from.   It has ample parking in a developing shopping complex with a modern urban/diner vibe upon entry amongst the silence of the majority of empty tables on a Saturday afternoon.  Their sides are satisfactory, but nothing special, since I ordered the shrimp tempura and it tasted more like the fried breading than the shrimp itself with an overly sweet dipping sauce. So, I would recommend sticking to their main entrees since those will rarely disappoint in portion size or quality. The meat given is equal to amount of rice and vegetables and their yakisoba though it isn't necessarily an item bursting with flavor despite the larger size of the meat as the flavor that does come from it is quite generic. I ordered the tofu with yakisoba, chicken and beef teriyaki and neither of them amazed but they did satisfy me for the equivalent of two meals."}
{"text":"I don't see a reason for anything less than five stars. Service is prompt, professional, kind, and efficient. Everything is served as is should and as expected. Prices are awesome and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"This location sucks. They get my order wrong often and act like customers are a bother. Woman who runs the pm register seems annoyed at customers who are waiting for their food. They can't seem to keep their new staff so we usually end up waiting around 15 minutes for the meal. Best location is wigwam and pecos."}
{"text":"A fast food teriyaki bowl food chain. This place is good for a quick lunch. I order my food, sit down, watch whatever game is playing and than my order is out. I haven't tried anything else but the spicy chicken bowl. It's a good sized bowl with spicy chicken, mixed veggies and rice. If you want to be healthy you can ask for brown rice. The portion is just right and the bowl is inexpensive."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness is a great option for quick and healthy meal.  I got the chicken teriyaki bowl (medium spicy) and added steamed vegetables for a buck more.  Out came a huge bowl of tasty chicken slathered in good ol' teriyaki sauce and crunchy tasty veggies.    Conclusion:  Healthy (depending what you order), quick and tasty."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. Super yummy! Great quality and very friendly staff. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for dinner on a Sunday night.  After begrudgingly taking our order, the cashier turned and complained \"It just won't stop\" to her fellow employees in the kitchen.  There were quite a few people waiting for food, but I thought a lot of business was considered a good thing??  After waiting almost 30 minutes, our food finally came out; I appreciate fresh-made but 30 minutes is excessive.  My husband had the chicken teriyaki and I had chicken yakisoba.  The chicken on both was lukewarm, edging on cold.  Pretty tough to do after cooking for 30 minutes I would say.  Poor food, badly run kitchen, and bad customer-service; we won't be back."}
{"text":"We had lunch here yesterday. The staff was friendly and helpful, the wait was short, and the Chicken Breast Teriyaki bowl I had was delicious! I think I'm finally getting my favorite bowl customization dialed in! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the food. I used to come here often prior to work. I'd call in fifteen minutes prior to my ETA and run in, pay, and come out with fresh food. Now? The last few times I've called, I've been placed on hold for FIVE minutes. And apparently being placed on \"hold\" means setting the phone down to the side while you hear the staff talking and joking with each other while you're trying to sit patiently waiting to give an order so you can purchase food. I no longer order here and will now be going to different establishments for food given the disrespect this place apparently gives for its customers over the phone. Thanks for the good food, no thanks for the terrible service."}
{"text":"Used to eat here on a fairly regular basis but stopped for whatever reason.  Stopped back by a extra spicy pork plate with mac salad.  It was everything I remembered it was.  When in the mood for a quick bite.  I will think about stopping back by."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Mediocre chicken dish with rice and not much taste. I can do better at Panda Express"}
{"text":"Here now on a Sunday night. No line. Great customer service. Food cooked and given to me within a decent time frame. Chill environment. I hope the food is good when I get home"}
{"text":"Food is pretty darn good! First time here, I got an Orange chicken bowl with fried rice and veggies, SO tasty. The chicken eggroll is amazing!! I would like to see a little more chicken in the bowl, but overall, I'll return for more."}
{"text":"Just left with my order  :)  First time here and ordered spicy Tofu, I was happy to learn from the nice girl behind the counter that you can customize the order so I asked for 1/2 & 1/2 Spicy tofu with 2 brown rice skip the veggies  :)  My ex ordered Chicken Katsu w/brown rice.   He was worried that it would not be filling as he is fat, well, not huge but he has a \"beer\" belly...Lets not get me started...  He loved it as did I.  We will go back for sure!  Best tofu I have had in a long time.   :)"}
{"text":"Disgusting! My husband wanted Terikayi so we ordered from here. Big mistake. Crab rangoons were overly fried and tasted like fish. Potsickers were basically burned and inedible. I am so disappointed. Everything except the teriyaki bowl was terrible. I would have preferred Panda Express - and that's saying something!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. I recently started a low carb diet and they offer a low carb chicken bowl with double veggies no rice and grilled chicken breast. The chicken is very VERY flavorful and never dry. The veggies are amazing as well and I always use a bit of Siracha to make it spicy! And they're spicy chicken bowl is amazing too. It's not usually busy at this location so we usually get our food pretty fast, and they are always nice and friendly at the front. Will be coming here a lot now."}
{"text":"I not a huge fan of teriyaki bowls so I always order the spicy chicken yakisoba and it is so delicious!!! The portions are huge so I always save the rest for later. The shrimp tempura is also quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Food tasted ok, not bad and not amazing. The setvice is great.  The only reason i give them 1 star rating is because they forgot to add my side dish to the orders i made, so we are basically eating just the meat and the rice :) So check your orders when you pick them up when you order to go."}
{"text":"This was exceptional beyond any expectations! The cashier, who I think might have been the manager was so kind and thoroughly explained options I wasn't even aware of. I had asked if it was frozen or old, as I went in an hour before closing, and he said it was all fresh. Sure enough, this food tasted SO FRESH and amazingly prepared. I've never had orange chicken, rice and carrots that tasted so great. I will definitely be returning soon! Well done!"}
{"text":"Service here was fast and efficient, food was fresh as always. There are several of these throughout the Vegas area and they're always good for a fast fresh meal."}
{"text":"Great food.. Great service. Friendly staff. The teriyaki bowl is superb. I usually call ahead to order and it's always done in the amount of time they tell me."}
{"text":"Chicken, teriyaki sauce, and rice...how can you go wrong?  I decided to try a combo plate with the beef teriyaki as well, for variety...  The teriyaki sauce on the beef has a different taste than the sauce on the chicken...  At first I didn't like it, but by the end, I was digging it.  All in all, it's nothing special (you can get chicken teriyaki most everywhere), but it's not bad either.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Yay, this location is finally open! So glad to have one closer to where I live! Same great menu to choose from. Went in there once to pick up dinner and service was pretty slow. Not sure if that was because it's new and didn't have adequate staffing or what.. Hopefully they improve on that."}
{"text":"I have been coming here at least once a week since they opened and never had a bad meal.  Usually I order the chicken teriyaki bowl with white rice and veggies, very simple but always delish. Today I tried the spicy chicken bowl the same way (with white rice and veggies) and it was AMAZING! Why have I not tried this before? Not too spicy, and so much flavor. That will be my new order for sure. Try it, your tastebuds will thank you. Oh, and don't forget the egg rolls!! Yummy I live 5 minutes away and I call my order in, it's always ready to pick up when I arrive, usually when I call they ask if I want the same order as last time which is convenient since my order rarely changes.  Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Well, we went here once before and I was really impressed.  My husband really likes another fast food Chinese place, but I am not a fan of fast food.    Teriyaki Madness is a blend of \"fast\" food and good quality food.  I was really impressed with the quality of the food!    We went back tonight for a second visit, and we waited about 25 minutes.  We saw some other people come and go with their orders.  I asked the cashier if they had forgotten our order.  She was very polite and said she was not sure.    After 45 minutes, I finally asked for a refund.  Again, the cashier was very pleasant and apologetic.    My problem is the person from the back who had to ring up our refund was sort of rude.  No apology.  I do not remember what she said, but I believe she was trying to blame the cashier for ringing up something incorrectly.  She seemed inconvenienced that we wanted a refund when in fact she should have apologized.    Not sure if we will go back.  Maybe we will call in our order.  I saw a few people came in and just got their order immediately.  Being new to Teriyaki Madness, we did not realize it was an option.  IF we go back, that will be the way to go!  I'd give one star, but the cashier was super friendly and we had a good experience the first time."}
{"text":"Great service .. English and Spanish spoken .. Clean and spacious the food is good and good Portions"}
{"text":"Madness in a bowl!  This location is nearby on the corner of Stephanie and Paseo Verde.  Since it's in the same parking lot as Eos Gym, there were many gym goers stopping in. The dining area is clean.  Not a very large area with tables but it seemed there were a lot of carry out orders so it was fine.  Service was fine- orders were correct and made in a reasonable amount of time.    I have been on a tofu kick so I wanted to try their Tofu Bowl.  I chose brown rice and vegetables to be included.  The bowl is plenty for me.  There was a good amount of tofu as well as fillers.  It was actually pretty decent.  I wouldn't mind ordering it again when I'm in the tofu mood.    For a quick and easy meal, Teriyaki Madness is good for me."}
{"text":"Quick and convenient. Food was tasty. Servers were friendly. Would come back again. Food was inexpensive but tasty. Not as good as chipotle, better than samurai sams."}
{"text":"Love the spicy chicken bowl,  it's what I get every time.  They also have LARGE yakisoba bowls that are always super delirious! The egg rolls aren't the best, I will skip on them the next time, but if you are looking for a somewhat healthy meal stop on by!"}
{"text":"TMad! Aside from my all time favorite teriyaki spot in LA, Teriyaki Madness is probably my second fave. This location is brand spanking new and much more spacious than most of the restaurants around town. Come try it and you'll fall in love too. The chicken is so tender and tasty. The veggies are delicious too. I've recently been converted to brown rice from a certain someone...so now that's my go-to. ;) The shrimp tempura & edamame are highly recommend also. The yakisoba is just ok. It's a bit too greasy for my taste, I'd pass on that. They also offer low-carb plates and chicken bowls for the kiddos. Glad this place is so close by. We probably eat here about once a week, their catchphrase \"Highly Addictive\" is very true.   Tip: Sign up to receive text alerts for promotions & deals."}
{"text":"Looked for a late night bite to eat that wasn't fried or sit down food. Ended up here for teriyaki chicken and veggies. I got the chicken breast w/ veggie bowl, kids got orange chicken and hubs got spicy chicken.  Kids orange chicken was SO GOOD but it's fried in a flour batter so it's not a healthy choice at all. My chicken was lean and veggies good but the teriyaki had too much cornstarch leaving a terrible after taste.  If I went back, I would try something different. But it was average at best for teriyaki chicken on the road."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  The staff were helpful and efficient.  The food came in a big Styrofoam box and had a small teriyaki sauce on the side.  I had the beef teriyaki with brown rice (I like they give you a choice of white or brown rice) and the side salad.   The price was ok.  The service time was acceptable.  Once home I saw box had rice on one side and the beef on the other.  The rice was very good, not overcooked or excessively sticky.  The beef was tasty but really chewy.  I'd try the chicken next time and see if its more tender.  All in all, nothing was good enough for me to want to go back again.  It wasn't bad, just kind of mediocre."}
{"text":"A lovely place to relax and enjoy teriyaki dishes. The service is great! The employees are polite. The atmosphere is good too."}
{"text":"Good. But not too happy about the watery teriyaki sauce on the table. Had to ask twice for the thick teriyaki sauce, that usually comes with it. Alittle expensive, but I love the salad and the whole combination of rice and char broiled chicken is what I was craving."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Huge TMad fan and went to the Wigwam location for the first time in years. Ordered a chicken teriyaki plate with extra meat which is what I always order and the Durango/w.springs and Maryland location.. The meat portion was average at best and had 2 bones in it, and they didn't give us the side salad. Will not be visiting that location again."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat near my house. It's a fresh Asian grill & food is made to order so it takes a little longer than fast food restaurants but that doesn't bother me because the food is good! I've heard people complain about prices here but all I can say is you get what you pay for. The portion sizes are good. I usually order a bowl & still have left overs to eat later. I recommend the spicy chicken or the spicy orange chicken w/ noodles or fried rice. I always get the fried rice the way I want which is extra egg & add onions. Normally it's just egg, carrots & peas. Recently had the grilled salmon w/ brown rice & veggies. I think I have a new fav order!"}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the Wigwam location, which I frequent often. The food and customer service isn't in the same league. If I had tried this location first I would never have tried any of the others."}
{"text":"Been here several times at this location. Never been to their other locations. There is a very cute and very friendly short Asian girl that takes my order each time. She is very friendly and accommodating. The food is always fresh and my order is always 100 correct."}
{"text":"I love this place !! It kicks Samurai Sam's ASS !! The food is amazing and service is great too !"}
{"text":"I had Teriyaki chicken with soba noodles. The sauce was watered down and the soba noodles were overcooked. It was disappointing enough that I would not make a special trip to go back to try something else. In fact I would probably avoid it in favor of something of somewhere else. The staff was very friendly though. Compared to this, Samurai SAMs  rates 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and I've been eating at teriyaki madness for years now. As I sit here eating at this particular location I notice a few things while I eat. The floor is dirty. Whoever mops, doesn't move anything when they mop, like the trash can behind the counter or the kids booster seats. The walls and wall signs are dirty. No one wipes them down. The drink refrigerator is dirty, no one wipes it down. Employees who should be wearing hair nets are not."}
{"text":"Probably the freshest, tender and most delicious Teriyaki chicken you will encounter. Never a disappointment! I ordered the chicken plate, with salad as the side. Love their salad & dressing as it compliments the whole meal nicely. Plenty of food on this plate for 2 meals or to share."}
{"text":"My wife and I just got done eating here. The food was good and the portion was even better! However, the customer service was horrible! I even tipped the cashier and he did not say a word. No thank you, no hello, no goodbye! He did not want to be working maybe because it was Halloween! I am not sure but he needs to go! Although the girl who gave me my food was nice."}
{"text":"Best teriyaki in town! Newest location in the Target/Winco shopping area. Super convenient & I like how the parking lot isn't super busy compared to other locations.   Everything is fresh & made to order! :) that's what makes it taste AMAZING! Remember they cook it how YOU want don't be afraid to ask for well done meat or sauce on the side, etc.  Overall clean restaurant, friendly staff & the food is good!  Make sure to try the spicy chicken bowl w/ noodles ;)"}
{"text":"This place is addicting! I love the bowls there. I've tried most everything on the menu and love it. You can always add extra meat for a little more and be completely satisfied."}
{"text":"I love this place..  The owner was super friendly and efficient.  I wish we had some in Summerlin area .. would prefer to Samaurai Sams"}
{"text":"Enjoying my bowl until I found a hair in it super glad I didn't eat it!! But ewwww!! I'm kinda grossed out!!"}
{"text":"Ordered there for work and was a huge success! Food arrived on time and hot and the only complaint we had was that people wish they had more of it. Chicken was grilled to perfection and the yakisoba noodles were delicious...not an easy feat when it comes to catering for 150+ people."}
{"text":"So I previously made a review of this place, and I was upset because I had found a piece of plastic in my bowl. The manager contacted me personally, and told me to return for a free meal for me plus a friend, AND he gave us free drinks. I'm very pleased to say that I'll be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Bad food! Bad service! It was over filled with smoke from the kitchen which ran customers out. Had a hard time getting our order correct. We are sticking with Yogis!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Service!! Payton greeted us with a welcoming smile.  She was friendly and inviting.  Shaydee brought us our food with a smile!   The spicy beef was delicious!   We appreciate great service, and we WILL recommend to friends!!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 10:43am on a Sunday (just now, as a matter of fact) and asked if they were open, as the neon \"Open\" sign was on, but the the sign on the door says 10:30am-10pm Mon-Sat & 11am-10:00pm on Sundays.  The girl looked at me like I was stupid and very snottily retorted, \"Uh, yeah, we open the same time every day.....\" -  Okay, if that's true fix the sign on the door and check your attitude."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and Super Great service, even Im working at a Japanese Restaurant but the teriyaki sauce here is much much better,mmmmm...... Im loving it !.......you will see me every week here !"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb!!!!!!! I came here after a long weekend at Cali! I got here at 9:15 pm and they were closing at 10 they were super friendly and helpful about the menu since it was my first time. The plates are affordable and you can make it healthy by what you choose! I got the spicy chicken plate with brown rice and fresh green salad! It was seriously so good haha I can't even explain and the bowls they give are so convenient. They remind me of meal prep bowls that youtubers use! Anyways definitely will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Food is always fresh. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys some good teriyaki fast food."}
{"text":"It's about what you'd expect. Good, but too expensive!  My husband ordered the yakisoba plate which was a generous portion.  I ordered the teriyaki bowl. Again, a fair portion.   Admittedly, the veggies are fresh, but mostly cabbage.  We did order an appetizer of potstickers and 2 drinks.   Our meal was $24!!! I could have spent much less at Panda Express and been full.  Doubtful that I would visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Always have to stop in to get my protein and veggies after a good workout at the gym.. fast pace workers awesome service and a clean environment !"}
{"text":"Customer service at this location is exceptional! The cashier totally brightened up my day. Of course my chicken breast plate was delicious as always!!"}
{"text":"This review is more about the service than the food. The food was of course, pretty standard and acceptable for what it is. I had excellent service from an employee named Rob. I placed a pick up order for about 5 or 6 people and he made the entire transaction as easy as possible, and made sure that I had everything that I needed. When I went to pick the order up you could tell that Rob was doing his best work possible. Fast and efficient, and friendly. I will go back again in the future."}
{"text":"We came in last night and ordered three Orange Chicken bowls with noodles (noodles being $1 extra.) come to realize once I'm eating they only put two (2) pieces of chicken in my bowl and filled the rest up with the noodles which I paid $1 for. I'm mad! What did the cook not cook enough for three bowls so figured bury it with noddles? So I basically paid for a bowl of noodles. That's not worth $9 or anywhere close to $9. Great way to rip off the customer, especially with it being a to go order."}
{"text":"We went for dinner a few nights ago. When coming to our table with our food, the waitress dropped my food on the floor. It took 15 minutes to make it and they say it's made fresh. Within three minutes she had another dish out to me and there was hair all through the dish. Funny how they drop the food on the floor and then have a new dish out that fast when it is supposed to be made to order. My guess...they picked the food up of the floor and served it! Do not eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"So I love this place. Especially the guy that normally works the counter. He always greets you with a smile and a hello. Tries to remember everyone's name. Always says thank you. However, the new girl working the counter with glasses is a Debbie downer. She been there the last 3 times I've gone. Always has a sour face, never says hello, goodbye, or thank you. She rarely makes eye contact. I tip 20% on a to go order and say thank you. I still get zero response. No thanks, no have a good day. Nothing!!! It's so rude!!! It makes me not want to come back. I gave 4 Stars because the restaurant is great. I just wish they would talk to this girl about her customer service skills or keep her off the register. If you don't like your job get a new one girl. Don't sit there and bring negativity to everyone's day you come in contact with!  I'm a business owner and would NEVER allow this behavior from an employee!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place 4 times total and so far I am pretty pleased with the overall experience.  I have only ordered the Spicy Chicken Bowl, and the Spicy Beef Bowl.  I really like the flavor with the added spice of both bowls.  You can get the meat on rice or noodles and probably more options that I really didn't pay attention too.  The price is pretty fair for the amount of food you get.  I prefer this place over Panda Express and other fast Chinese food type places because I get more meat and less other junk.  The service is nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either, basically just what I would expect."}
{"text":"Went here on a coupon. Great coupon deals by the way.  Got a buy one get one free deal so i decided on a chicken plate and yakisoba. The co-owner was very nice through the whole ordering process and threw in a free macaroni salad for my first visit.  The food didnt meet my expectations but was very good. I was expecting a lot more flavors and assumed that if i got a plate it would at least come with some vegetables other then just meat and grain. Anyway lets break this down:  Brown rice Cooked perfectly had a very nice texture  Chicken Had really nice grilled taste seeing how it's grilled, the sauce was just poured over. Was expecting a lot more but the tasted of grilled meat with a sauce that complements it just shut me up and made me enjoy my food.  Vegetable Yakisoba More like a chow mein then yakisoba. most likely would never order again.  Overall the food wasn't exactly what i was expecting but was still very enjoyable with an energetic and welcoming co-owner"}
{"text":"There's something to be said that my brother and husband will eat spicy chicken plates with brown rice 3-4x/week. At lunchtime you'll find a small wait as they can get busy. Tonight I called in an order to go on the way over to the restaurant and it was ready in 10 minutes on the dot as promised.   As a vegetarian,  I order the Tofu plate which is served with brown rice, white rice, fried rice, or veggies with an Asian side salad or macaroni salad. Teriyaki tofu is tasty every time!  I asked and the Tofu is vegan... just fried with teriyaki sauce. Just in case some of you were wondering...  Prices are great with large portions."}
{"text":"If you want something quick and pretty good \"asian food\" go for it.  I wasn't disappointed it was exactly what I expected.  The old Teriyaki Chicken Bowl from Jack is better."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 8 yrs. going to miss this place when i leave.   Great food and usually fast service but they totally forgot about my order today. Tsk tsk"}
{"text":"Finally somewhere healthy to eat. And its delicious and affordable.  I hired a trainer who recommended me to eat here. I hate cooking my own food! After just a month I lost a good amount of weight by only eating here for most of my meals during the day. I LOVE their low carb plate with steamed vegetables,  white chicken, no sauce. The chicken is moist and the vegetables are fresh. Also, their Chicken Salad and dressing is to die for!   Service is always fast and friendly. No matter how busy they are (and they usually are busy), tables are always clean, very relaxing, chill environment.   Thank you Teriyaki Madness for helping me with my weight loss goals!!!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies! Always fresh, made to order & fast service!! Caution sign does not lie..food is VERY addicting!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness is a staple in our household. Weather you call to go or dine in it's healthy and quick! My personal favorite is the spicy chicken Teryaki! And the vegetables are very fresh!"}
{"text":"Yakisoba noodles w/ spicy chicken, oh yeah, several times a week, love this spot. Great place to hit up after the gym, everyone comes here, cops, firemen, construction workers and the gym bunnies too. Always with the fresh vegetables , can't go wrong there. We like that it opens at 10:00 am and so it seems do a lot of people. The madness, it's addictive!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for my coworker that bought me Teriyaki Madness for my birthday, I would seriously be missing out. I love spicy food, so I got the spicy chicken bowl with noodles and veggies and let me tel you I haven't switched and remained follower since. I find myself here at least one a month and love the taste of their chicken.  It's just the perfect combination of spicy and crunch I love. The place is also next to a Starbucks if you find yourself some iced tea. They offer different sides as well if you don't like noodles you can either get fried or white rice. And the steamed veggies so healthy for you! And since I'm changing my nutrition this is a good spot to keep that healthy eating going! Try their potstickers as well because they are superb, if you haven't tried them yet I recommend that you do! cannot wait to go back to Teriyaki Madness because it is a madness to not have tried it way sooner."}
{"text":"Terrible service. This location put a bad taste in my mouth. I usually got 2/3 times a week to the blue diamond location but screw this place. They just cost blue diamond a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken breast teriyaki, katsu chicken, and orange chicken.  Chicken breast was delicious...very flavorful.  Katsu chicken was good but a little too overdone.  Orange chicken was very good!  Would definitely go back.  only downside was once my hubby got home with the food, he realized we did not get our macaroni salad and green salad sides.  Too hungry to go back for them.    Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Gave samples of orange chicken."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant and ordered food and then come to find out its all tables with booth seating. Me being over weight I became offended knowing that I was not going to fit in the booth. A lady then tried to give me a chair witch was nice but I turned it down because I am not got to give my money to a restaurant that cannot accommodate everybody."}
{"text":"Best teriyaki place for the price. Eat here everytime I stay at the hotel across the street and have never had a bad experience. Always friendly, always timely and always made correctly. Plus they still have Sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"Love it! Super friendly vibe and awesome food as always! Their shrimp tempura is my favorite! My sister always gets the edemame and enjoys every last kernel thing of it!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies! Sometimes I indulge in their crab rangoons, too...tasty little morsels!"}
{"text":"I don't know what I just ate but it was not cooked chicken. It was wet, soft, but crisp? It looked white so I ate it still but I could only eat 1 piece before spitting the second piece out. I came in at 8:00pm. They still had an hour left before close, so it wasn't like I was last second (I'll never be that guy) and the people behind the counter were gathered around in a circle talking. Then acted annoyed when I made an order. The iPad that have up front asks you to tip or no tip. I clicked no tip and the girl taking my order took it very personally. Once I paid she said my name and that was the last I heard her talk. Even after I got the food I said \"thank you!\" and she faked smiled at me. Sorry I'm not gonna tip you for doing your job that consists of pressing 2 buttons? Tips are earned! I will be updating this review if end up viciously throwing up later this evening from whatever I just ate! Lol. Safe to say I will never be coming back here!"}
{"text":"i don't know if they're all the same.. but i've been to the one on warm springs and it's a good place.  good food, friendly service... large portions..  very good terriyaki.  the beef is sweeter than usual..  [but i like that] i love ordering the noodles and beef terriyaki.. but the over all consensus at the crib is the chicken..  all plates are served with veggies or a side salad.   very good for a quick and heavy meal!"}
{"text":"I love Teri madness. This location has been off to a slow start. I have been several times and it has been hit or miss. First time it took awhile to get my food. My last time that I ordered I ordered online. They were out of steak. I was sad to have it happen to me because I read some reviews where that happened. Overall a tasty option."}
{"text":"I liked it a lot. The chicken breast and the chicken katsu were both really good. Brown rice and veggies make it feel healthy too"}
{"text":"Concerns with the new menu and the increase of cost for meals. I had originally gave the establishment a 1 star, but after speaking with the manager I feel as if that was low. His/her speedy response, concern and understanding is what has changed my mind for now. I would still like to see an evolution of the current menu options,but we'll see."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed, pricing is high, and Samurai Sam's in my opinion, gives you more food and is much better taste-wise and selection-wise...I tried this place because it had a coupon for free chicken bowl from the RJ, so I decided to go down the street to try it, they should include veggies for the price you are paying...good thing I got it for free..."}
{"text":"So good, so fresh, so fast! I love the spicy chicken and noodle bowl with veggies, the teriyaki is great too and the bowls are a good portion. If you've got a bigger appetite they've got full plates as well.   The store is pretty new and they are already on top of their game, so happy they opened a location close to me- I'll be eating it way more than my waistline (and wallet) will appreciate!"}
{"text":"Love to get lunch here. I actually have their number saved in my phone because I will order over the phone, leave my house or office and pick it up for lunch. Usually only get teriyaki chicken bowl. Thought the yakisoba was greasy, but it usually is a greasy dish in general. Wish they had a larger size cup especially because they have that awesome small ball ice chunks. It is a little pricey looking at $10 a meal. Crab ragoons and potstickers seem too American-ized for my taste. But always fast and hot!"}
{"text":"New Teriyaki place located off of Blue Diamond Rd in the parking lot with Albertson's.  Staff is friendly and will greet you right away when you walk in.  This is my second time going here (sorry I forgot to YELP the first time).  I was very pleased that you can have brown rice versus white rice.  My food has always come out promptly and I never feel rushed to order at the counter.  The first time that I went I had Chicken Teriyaki with brown rice and stir-fry veggies.  The Chicken Teriyaki was great, not over cooked and flavorful.  My brown rice was made perfectly and fresh.  Now the veggies were sub-par.  The second time that I went I had the Spicy Chicken Teriyaki which was very flavorful and I was happy that there was not a great deal of fat on the chicken pieces (I have noticed that at other establishments).  This time I had a side salad and brown rice, the salad was fresh but there was not anything special about it (the salad dressing was good though and a nice serving size).  The rice again was made fresh and cooked to perfection.  So if you are in the area give them a try."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best chicken teriyaki places in north Vegas. They are a chain all over Vegas but this has to be one of the best locations! The service is excellent and the food is always cooked to perfection. This locations gets busy around lunch time but any other time you will be in and out with ease. The portions are the best option about this place. They have 4 different options that can fill anyone's needs. The location is always clean and the customer service is always excellent."}
{"text":"I've been coming for years because of the fresh quality ingredients. The spicy chicken low carb bowl is my go to! We decided to try them for a large order for our Centennial Hyundai Dealership. The order was accurate, ready on time and the bowl was still hot upon arrival! The entire staff was happy and it was delicious as always. Thank you for your consistency and always providing friendly service in addition to your healthy alternative to convenient food."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber eats yesterday and it was a sad experience! Orderd 2 bowls, one with orange chicken and the other with beef teriyaki, it was delivered in big round plastic tub filled with fried rice to 2/3, fried greens (greatly cooked) on one half, and some tiny sad pieces of meat on the other side. The pieces of meat was so tiny that it was almost grinded. I ordered medium spice on teriyaki beef, extra onions, fried rice and had to pay extra for spicy and no extra onions was added.  Time to go back to Iron Chef in Queen Creek where they know what they are doing..."}
{"text":"Located in close proximity to the buffed and toned of the 24 hour fitness, Teriyaki Madness is the essential place for rice bowls. Always busy and always good, my favorite thing here is probably what the work out junkies miss, the macaroni salad!! I picked up lunch and ordered a Teriyaki bowl with all white meat, white rice (you can get brown for all you health food guys and gals) and a side of macaroni. Like any good Hawaiian terikaki the macaroni salad is creamy and crunchy and never tart. You can get beef or pork but I just can't seem to get off what I always get, I will admit I really should venture out and try the stir fry or the beef, but I give this place five stars on this one dish alone that I have ordered so many times. I always fax in the order at 702 248 8623 and it is ready for pick up and I avoid the muscle bound line at rush hour work out hours. Thank you Teriyaki Madness for making healthy food so good!! (well most of it ha ha)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I had the spicy chicken and hubby had teriyaki chicken. The staff messed up my husbands order so the manager gave him a coupon for a free bowl. I'm always impressed when management tries to rectify problems. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"UberEATS.   I ordered from a nearby hotel and watched my order from processing to delivered within 30 mins.   Excellent value and taste pretty good.   It's not like a Hawaiian plate lunch, but it'll do when you're traveling and need to get your Asian rice.   I ordered from here twice during my week out in Charlotte.   Be sure to ask for soy sauce and chopsticks in the UberEATS app."}
{"text":"They have great food! Always clean in the store and you can even call ahead your order so you don't have to wait while they cook it fresh! Its not to long of a wait but at times it can be so to have this option available I love! This location is VERY hard to find though! More signs!!!!"}
{"text":"I walked in the restaurant where I was greeted very kindly and the person taking my order was very nice and helpful. I ordered my food and sat down at a very clean table and my food was ready within 5 minutes. The chicken was amazing and so was the rice. The cashier asked if I was enjoying everything. I said I was. But that made me think back to my senior prom when I asked the boy of my dreams to a slow dance. He turned me down and danced with my best friend Tinisha. Now they are married with 2 kids.  I was enjoying my food until I was triggered back to the worst night of my life. Wouldn't recommend eating here where the workers are so insensitive asking if I'm \"enjoying\" everything."}
{"text":"Food here is Bomb.com. Steak plate Chicken plate and Katsu plate, So good! My new go to Teriyaki place."}
{"text":"Great service. Easy to call ahead and pick up. The food is solid quality no fatty or over breaded deep fried chicken. The sauces taste great teriyaki, orange, and hot teriyaki. Sometimes the chicken can be oily that's why 4*"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for teriyaki chicken. I prefer this place over Panda and the like, although TM brands itself as Asian Fusion, so it is a bit different than other places. A lot of my health conscious friends like to eat here because you can get a healthy, filling meal that's not swimming in oil. Plus the portions are big enough to have some leftover for tomorrow's lunch!   You can choose a bowl or plate, then pick your protein. Options include chicken breast, spicy chicken, orange chicken, beef and teriyaki tofu. Then you add white or brown rice, (noodles and fried rice are other options for an additional charge) and mac salad or a house salad. They also have appetizers including edamame and cream cheese wontons, egg rolls and potstickers. They may be a bit pricier than other chains, but I think the quality is better. If you have never been, I suggest you try the spicy chicken bowl with mac salad and brown rice. The flavors will make your mouth sing happy songs!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the wait was horrible. It took almost 30 minutes to get my To Go order of the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. I finally had to ask for the status of my order when a couple behind me got there food before me. They quickly quickly put my bowl together, almost if they forgot my order until I had to remind them."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say that the food here is great. Large portions, seems pretty fresh, and the flavor is great. I come here often because of the food.   The only issue I have is the wait times. I have never gotten out of here with take out in less than 15-20 minutes. If there are one to two customers waiting, it takes around 15 minutes. Today there were five customers waiting at 4:00pm on a Monday and it took me 40 minutes to get out of there with one item. I will give them credit and say that they realized it was long and provided me a free bowl voucher for my next visit.   I know they are still newer but the wait times are something I would never expect at a walk up and order restaurant. I don't blame the staff because they always appear to be working hard and are friendly.   I feel the issue is being understaffed. There are rarely more than 3 employees there (2 in the kitchen, 1 in front). I think it's just too much to handle with those few people. It also may just be the way the food is prepped   I have a feeling the wait times are seriously impacting the business. I will continue to go often but know that if I'm in a time crunch that it may not always be the best option."}
{"text":"One of my favorite late nite stops. The food is always good and the portions are large. I wish they were in other locations...Hint, Hint....lol"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's delicious and so are the prices!! Not to mention the daily speci"}
{"text":"Teriyaki madness is delicious. They pack a lot of protein in their meat and the sauce is amazing. Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"For fast and cheap teriyaki this place is pretty great. A huge selection of proteins which half the time aren't even offered at other establishments; this place has a much better variety to satisfy everyone in a group. The portions are plentiful and overall a great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I love their spicy chicken & spicy tofu. Their food is fresh...perfect for meal planning."}
{"text":"I went there this morning after the gym it's an excellent after gym protein and carb meal.  Customer service there is always friendly the food is always freshly made and very good tasting. I'm a big fan of the pot stickers and the chicken breast Bowl."}
{"text":"Awesome deals on yelp, and coupons on the receipt! I love a good deal. The food is good too!"}
{"text":"My go-to \"it's 5:30 I'm off work and extra lazy\" spot. I always call in my order, and to my surprise, they always know exactly what I'm going to order and it's ready fresh everytime I get there.   The katsu bowl is fire y'all. I drench it with katsu sauce and like 10 tubs of their teriyaki sauce.   While I don't venture off on their limited menu often, the spicy chicken is just as tasty.   Teriyaki madness is bae!"}
{"text":"The guy that took my order today deserves a raise! Didn't get his name.. but he was smiling and starting conversations with customers in such a nice genuine way! We need more nice people like this!!"}
{"text":"Great food, Service is superb, the young man that helped guide me with the menu was so nice. Here in Las Vegas you can eat anything anytime but you can't get service like this just any where... Keep up that great service....."}
{"text":"Great quality chicken! Chicken Teriyaki bowl is yummy. Excellent portion sizes. They need better forks and knives, the forks are flimsy. Fun atmosphere and worth the price! Will definitely be a regular here. Bring your own flatware - lol !"}
{"text":"\"Teriyaki Sadness\"   Long lines at Disneyland The smell of hospitals Dropped ice cream cones Rained out parades Weekend homework Learning an old neighbor lady has passed The series finale of your favorite TV show Having to bury the family dog Being at a Nickelback concert Teriyaki Madness   Life is full of disappointments, do you really need to add another to the list?  Teriyaki Madness is the equivalent of finding out a girl you like is going out with your best friend- and guess what... You payed for their date.  You had high hopes for this girl, saw her becoming a large part of your life, maybe introducing your friends and family to her.  She looked so nice in the pictures.  Don't be fooled by the \"madness\".  The only thing crazy about this place is how much \"average\" they can cram into a teriyaki bowl.  In all reality, the food isn't horrible, just bland and uninspiring.  I spent $10 on a salmon bowl with less flavor than I could make at home for $4.  However, there is something to be said for a nice, relatively healthy lunch option on-the-go.  For best results, temper expectations prior to entering.  And prepare yourself for flashbacks of the time you were an inch too short to ride that roller coaster as a child."}
{"text":"Really diggin this spot. The taste is good time after time! The meats are always tender. I can never finish my food. Portions are great! Ton of different ways and options to make it up. They also have a good appetizer selection. Love getting my protein and carbs after my work out hehe"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Really disappointed with tonight's visit. It seems like half the portion size as normal on all 3 bowls I ordered."}
{"text":"His place is so shitty. We ordered food through door dash   And 2 hours later we still had no food. We called teriyaki madness and they never placed our our and then told us that it was to late to place our our and they would give us a 7 dollar door dash and no food. This place is horrible, service is horrible. Don't eat here. We tried to talk to a manager and they put us on hold for over 10 minutes.  Horrible place and people here"}
{"text":"Love Teriyaki Madness!! Always was my go to spot when needing a somewhat healthy on the go meal. Recently I have become Vegan and was super excited to see they have tofu bowls as well.   GINORMOUS amount of tofu per serving which is amazing &it was cooked perfectly! Never a disappointment! I have loved EVERYTHING from this place!!"}
{"text":"When our food came out (took a while but that is expected), the bowls were great!  Fresh and tasty.  Only downsides were that the edamame took forever to come out and the crab rangoons were not good.  Overall I'd definitely come back but just stick to the bowls."}
{"text":"I love the teriyaki plate with the white rice and the macaroni salad. That's usually what I'll order here. Their prices are high but it's worth the quality of the food. Plus the portions are nice and very filling. The restaurant is always nice and clean and the food is always fresh. It's big enough in there so they always have tables available."}
{"text":"This is the best teriyaki place in Henderson/ Vegas! The food is always fresh and amazing and I have to come here at least once a week because it's just that good! I highly recommend this place! And just a tip, if you like spicy food go for the spicy chicken! Not only is the food good the workers are amazing! I love Jaret and Myan! They're always so kind and helpful! #TMadForLife"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! My daughter and I stopped in on a whim. I'm so glad that I did. It's kinda pricey but well worth it. I got 4 meals out of my teriyaki bowl. The vegetables were delicious. The flavor of everything was perfect. I'll definitely go back. The staff was extra helpful as well."}
{"text":"Want to eat healthy on the cheap?  Come here.  Yeah, it's still fast food-ish, but it's significantly better than french fries and a cheeseburger.  Your tummy will thank you.  This is probably my favorite location in town.  The staff is always friendly and helpful, and the food quality is consistently delicious.  And, of course, their signature teriyaki sauce is some sort of magical, legal drug that you can't get enough of.  Recently they've introduced a salmon teriyaki bowl for $8 or $9, and it's good!  I'm not sure if it's for a limited time or not, but whatever salmon they get is delicious - no funny tastes and a hearty portion.  You can also ask for your veggies on the side - they will put them in a nice little to-go container.  This is good if you order chicken katsu and don't want it to get soggy.  Paleo/watching your carbs?  Ask them to nix the rice and double up on veggies.  They're cool about that."}
{"text":"Love the terriyaki chicken bowl.  Fair price for a large bowl.  Tasty terriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but their customer service needs some refreshing. I had one of the worst Customer Service experiences at this location with not only 1 employee but 2, both at separate instances. I even contacted Corporate and Management to inform them of my experience and was never contacted back."}
{"text":"Well what an incredibly unpleasant experience at this establishment thanks to your horrible restaurant representative and server Khai. Are you kidding me? We came here all the way from Colorado visiting the town for an entire week. We just passed by and thought we would stop in. Forget us coming back here at all during our stay and j would advise others to do the same. We came in and ordered. My partner decided on his meal and then was asked if he would like a drink. We were inquiring about what drinks they had and then was told. We were deciding and Khai decided it would be best to slam his fist on the counter to signal that we need to rush our decision. NOT OKAY nor will it make us rush our decision. I stared him right in the eye just in shock at his actions. Then he asked again in a sarcastic rude time of voice. As if we didn't have more orders to give him. This is absolutely ridiculous and uncalled for no matter the circumstance. I would like a manager or the manager of this establishment to contact me right away and want my money back."}
{"text":"I read other reviews and not sure what they're complaining about.  If you want gourmet Asian food go to an actual Asian restaurant.  Very few legit Japanese Teriyaki places in Vegas so either change your expectation or go elsewhere.  If you're looking to spend around $10 on a meal including drink this will satiate. I rate businesses on a reasonable expectation of value, cleanliness and friendliness of staff.  First off, compare TM with $10 meal joints serving relatively fast food and don't judge it as Japanese.  It's a quick lunch/dinner joint with middle ground ethnic food like Chipotle and the convenience of subway.  That said, the facility is kept very clean with condiments and soda fountain kept very orderly.  An employee makes rounds to wipe down tables and put things away every so often.  I didn't wait in line long and was greeted warmly and was taken care of proficiently.  I come here frequently when I'm indecisive and always get a no-sauce chicken bowl with white rice and veggies.  Veggies and rice are consistently well cooked and fresh and not greasy.  The amount of chicken can vary slightly but overall has been consistently moderately to very moist.  I have never had dry chicken with TM.  I will post a picture of my meal today and it's pretty representative of what I usually receive.  This is one of those joints you crave or go to if you need a relatively healthy reasonably priced meal.  I gave them five stars because I couldn't think of anything to nit pick over during my visit."}
{"text":"I love that I can be in my last machine at the gym, call in my order and it is ALWAYS waiting for me when I walk across the parking lot. My order has never been wrong (and I'm on a diet and my boyfriend is a body builder - so you know our order are opposite and complicated) Everyone who works here is friendly and when I ahve a coupon that let me substitute bottled water for soda - which I REALLY appreciate!"}
{"text":"I love going here for a protein fix after the gym.  It may not be the healthiest with the teriyaki sauce but who cares, it tastes good and it comes in huge portions!  It is really convenient, and they are usually pretty quick about their service.  There really isn't anything to complain about here, just a good spot to grab some quick grub."}
{"text":"Fast food that is healthy and taste good.  You can order it spicy which is good (but could be spicier for us spice nuts).  Good prices too."}
{"text":"The food here is great especially the spicy chicken."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE ! i was sooo much better than i was expecting. i got the signature spicy chicken with white rice. and it was GOOD, better the panda express. very flavorful and the food tasted real lol."}
{"text":"Just order a chicken breast bowl with no broccoli. The chicken was rubbery and I couldn't tell if it was fully cooked.  It wasn't cooked enough for my liking so I opted to not eat it.  Found pieces of broccoli in my bowl.  I don't ask for this because I don't like it, I am allergic.  I've tried this location a few times in the past and each time I remember why I stopped going.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I consistently have a good experience when I come here.  The staff is quick and attentive, food is good (edamame!) and overall good location.  We frequent this place when we want to have a decently healthy meal.  Chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies is straightforward and tasty.  Plus, they always have coupons!"}
{"text":"The food is very good here. The chicken is fresh, the servings are large, and it tastes wonderful. Unfortunately, we walked in at 8:50pm on a Thursday night (close at 9pm) and were rudely greeted with a scowl from the guy in the kitchen and the young lady at the counter. We asked, \"Hey, sorry we are close to close, but can we get takeout?\" The two glanced at each other and said \"Yeah... no. We already shut down.\"   Used to be a regular customer. We will not return, and we will be sure to tell others about our experience."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, prices reasonable and restaurant is clean.  Great for a quick and reasonably healthy meal."}
{"text":"This place supports first responders and military what a amazing staff. Food is amazing as well as the service"}
{"text":"Consistently pleasing food and friendly service! And their sauce is WONDERFUL! I usually get a monthly coupon in the local mailers and use that to dine in or take out. This is definitely one of my favorite local spots."}
{"text":"Was in town from LA, and I've tried many teri chicken before but NOTHING like this TM\"s spicy teriyaki chicken. wow!! the flavor just bursts!! and what made it a better deal was that my friend and i had a Groupon to use. got the spicy teri chicken bow with brown rice and chicken katsu bowl, (4)pc shrimp tempura and a small drink. with taxes it came out to $21.04 i believe - so i presume the pretax amount was less than $20, bc i didn't owe anything.  came out fresh and quick (maybe 5min if that) hand delivered by the nice cashier, and wife loved the way the spicy teri ckn tasted \"really grilled\". our kids also finished the chicken katsu. the portions were pretty good sized, definitely filled us up. next time we're back in town, we're coming back and bringing our friends with us !!  ps: cashier was really nice and knew right away we had a Groupon to use and she just knew what she was doing."}
{"text":"Just go to the mall and get teriyaki there. You'll get more and it tastes about the same.  Don't order the beef teriyaki. It tastes like meat shaped teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Always fast and clean. Chicken always cooked perfectly and the sauce is very tasty. I usually get the chicken teriyaki bowl. Wife always gets spicy chicken bowl (which is great as well). Everything is inexpensive ($15 for 2 bowls)"}
{"text":"One of the better and healthier fast food joints in the area! The menu is fairly simple, yet full of options. Choose your protein (teriyaki chicken, salmon, etc) and decide if you want a bowl or plate (which has about 2 oz of additional meat). Both come with your choice of rice (or low carb with veggies as a sub) and the plate also comes with an additional side (veggies or salad).   My order is always the same when I come here: teriyaki chicken plate, low carb, with salad as my additional side. The food always comes out hot and fresh, and is surprisingly filling for under $10 per plate. I love their chicken and the fact that they don't overly drench it in teriyaki sauce! They put just the right amount of sauce on it for my taste, but there is always extra sauce on every table in case you need more!  You never have to wait very long for your food which is awesome because I'm usually already very hungry when I stop by. Definitely recommend this place to anyone that tries to eat healthy but still enjoys going out to eat!"}
{"text":"I never have anything bad to say about this place. Food is fresh and always tastes great. Price is good and staff is always friendly. Healthy fast food at its best."}
{"text":"Good, but left my ipad there.......went looking for it. A very expensive lunch. Plus the person who took my order had a bad attitude. To many other good places in the area to deal with that."}
{"text":"Good stuff  Spiced chicken is my favorite, always fast cost effective and healthy conspired to the competition."}
{"text":"Never coming back to this Teriyaki Madness.. They never had a problem using the frequent buyer punch cards before and now they said they no longer honor them. Well I guess I'll no longer be going there and continue my business with the other locations. What's the point of a franchise if you don't keep things the same."}
{"text":"This location is not great. The people who work here are so lazy. I came in 20 minutes before they closed, at a place that's supposed to be quick and Togo, my order is usually ready in 5 minutes -- so I don't think I'm ruining the people's night by coming in a half hour before close.  The girl was cashing out her register, the soda machine was shut down, and everything in the kitchen was put away. They employees looked really mad that me and a few other people came in to order behind me.  I ordered a plate for me and my friend half chicken half beef. It took them 15 minutes to make the food. When I got home and opened the box - they only gave me 3 small pieces of chicken and a huge portion of BURNED beef. What a waste. Will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I suggest this place if you want something quick and slightly nurturing. Fresh veggies, tofu and pasta. It was a awesome combo. I'm vegetarian and I love their tofu which you can request crispy. Please try it. I heard the orange chicken is awesome!"}
{"text":"Come here quite often and I had my run in with the most awful service in the world, all ranging from taking my order then forgetting to place it, to just flat out being ignored. I always leave a tip so I am sure that is not the issue, they just manage to find the most nasty people to run the counter. Some days it's not as bad and the food is always ok. Always a good cheap fix for your chicken teriyaki cravings."}
{"text":"Just like their location on Craig this restaurant has great food. Has low carb options and they serve salmon now as well. Great customer service and they got my order right :)"}
{"text":"I woke right around the corner and come here all the time! The spicy white meat chicken bowl with veggies is my fav!!!"}
{"text":"I usually get the teriyaki plate but today I tried the spicy chicken plate and I must say the flavor is real nice. Every time I've been here it hasn't been packed so the food is served really fast lol Food tastes good and a healthier choice for my active peeps out there"}
{"text":"I got 2 orders of the half & half bowl (chicken/beef, about 10$ for a large bowl). The portion was more than enough to get you full. The meat was flavorful & juicy. Love their side veggies that's included with the meal. The female cashier was friendly & helpful. Service was great. Food came out quick. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Love Teriyaki madness! Food is fresh and delicious! Teriyaki Chicken plate is amazing and very cheap. Great place if your craving teriyaki"}
{"text":"So rude!!!! I hate them I wanted to call in my order so it I can just go in pay and pick up dinner. Well I was on the phone on hold the entire time while driving there. And then I was still on the hold when I arrived at the restaurant up until I was actually in front of them ready to give them my order. I said \"well I can probably hang up now that I am here since you placed me on hold this entire time.\" I said it with a smile while looking directly at her. \"You don't seem to concern about the customers on the phone do you?\" She even answered the phone while I was there and placed them on hold as well. Cashier's response, \"Uuuh, so what can I get for you?. There was like maybe two more couples in this place so it was not like they were bombarded with orders. This person was not even apologetic what so ever.  She asked other girl \"hey did you put some one on hold\". Response: Yeah, I don't know. CLUELESS. The entire staff does not have ANY customer service skills. And then when I got my order, I check to see if it was all there and I opened the box, this chick NOT EVEN LOOKING , put the packets of sauce in the my BOX!!!!!!!! while I was inspecting. Seriously!!!!!"}
{"text":"Up and coming new concept for teriyaki lovers. Food is cooked to order with a variety fresh chicken and beef with fresh veggies.   Establishment is extremely clean and well organized. Manager on duty was pleasant and patient as he explained of the variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant and restrooms. Greeted at the door, fast service, easy menu to choose from. Lots of healthy items too."}
{"text":"Been a fan for years... ever since there first location. Been to multiple TM locations & almost always good service & great food. Recently I went to the Lake Mead location & not only was the service not that great(counter girl) but the food portion was not the same as all the other stores. I thought this was a one time thing til I went back & the EXACT SAME interaction & food portion happened.  This really sucks cause its the closest one to my house. ( the 2 stars is just for this location...won't be going there anytime soon)"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of my old high school spot called SPIKE'sTERIYAKI BOWL in Cali. The teriyaki sauce and the chicken were all delish! The rice was cooked perfect too. I loved it that I was able to add more teriyaki sauce to my food.... Mmm mmmm gooood!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times and definitely prefer it over the Samurai Sam's across the street. They are always so friendly and the food is fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Is the good hot food only reserved for certain people? I say this because I was in the complex area where this restaurant is located and smelled some good cooking coming from this Teriyaki Madness. It was about evening time so I assumed they are putting out good hot food for the crowd on their way home from work. So I went in. Sure enough when I got in I can smell the food even better. I did not know what to order because I never ate here before so I asked the cashier guy \"What is it that I am smelling\"? He pointed to the back and said \"Chicken\". I was able to see the chicken on the grill also and said \"Perfect....give me a chicken bowl (whatever the name was called). I was excited to get there just in time for the food to be cooked hot off the grill. However, the mistake I a made was when I asked for my meal to go. The cashier started acting a little funny then. He took my food payment. Then darted to the back of the kitchen and in my opinion, started to influence my meal to the cooks. What I mean by that is I believe he told them to give me the old chicken that was probably sitting there waiting for someone who wanted it to go. He was smart enough to know most people that ask for their meals to go just grab the bag and go and don't check it till they get home or miles down the road. I went a few miles down the road and pulled in a gas station to get gas. Before going in while seated in the parking lot, I wanted to take a quick eat of my food. I opened it and the chicken meat looked very, very old and was cold. This was not the fresh new meat I walked in and saw grilling. I want to ask this cashier why did he go in the back and tell the cooks to give me old food or why did he as a cashier need to turn into a cook and prepare my meal? Your job was not to prepare food, it was to be a cashier. I know businesses are practicing techniques that alleviate waste of food and I feel they did not want to throw food away, but instead came up with a concept to give any old food made hours ago to customers who ask for their meal to go. So I encourage anyone reading this, if you get your meal from this location (any other restaurant period),  please check your food before leaving. I hope the owner or the boss is reading this. Please train your employees so they won't run off customers. The cooks were doing a fantastic job cooking because the food smelled amazing. They are not my problem.    I was very hurt (and still is) to know that this employee thought so less of me for whatever reason to think I did not deserve a hot meal. Who was he reserving the hot chicken for and why are they considered more worthy of than me? I had no confrontation with the cashier/there was no feud or attitude exchange; so there was absolutely no reason to be motivated to give me old/cold chicken when new chicken was ready and hot off the grill in my face. TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthy and delicious meal then look no further! Not only is this the best teriyaki you can find, but the service here is unbeatable! The cashier was personable and friendly without missing a beat. Not only was my food ready quickly after I ordered, but I was impressed by the generous amount of food I received - all at a great price! The quality was also top tier, made with noticeably fresh veggies. Their homemade teriyaki sauce and fried rice are to die for!! I will definitely be coming back and bringing my friends with me! #TeamTMad"}
{"text":"This place was perfect, even after workouts and gym sessions. Its fast, healthy, and delicious. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but we were waiting for it for too long. I will probably will go there again only if I have a coupon, otherwise no. Very slow service"}
{"text":"Call ahead or expect a long wait time. They are not the most polite over the phone but the food is very fresh and yummy. It takes a while though. So if you are short on time CALL lol can't say that enough. Decent location. Parking could definitely be better."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you get. It's just chicken and rice. How can they justify charging $10 a plate for about a $1 worth of chicken and $.25 worth of rice. I suggest only going if you have a BOGO coupon and that still isn't a deal since your forced to buy two drinks which is $5. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat something healthy.  They have several options like all white meat chicken, salmon, brown rice, and veggies. The service  you receive here is always friendly and they always get my order right.  Order ahead if you don't want to wait, becuase they cook everything to order."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and my Tofu bowl was on point.  I'm glad this place offers vegan options. I'll be coming back for more tofu :)"}
{"text":"First time here because somebody told me about it. I got the spicy chicken bowl with brown rice. Can we say food is on point.  Half way done with the bowl and I'm full. This will be my new spot especially since the food is fresh and I get to put what veggies I want in."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!  The cashiers were friendly.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because it took some time to get my order although they were very busy!  I understand to a point as they cook everything fresh to order.  Next time I will call in my order.  Love the spicy chicken and chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"It always see some Teriyaki Madness driving around the valley so finally decided too try one out for myself. Besides I was looking for something healthy for post workout meal. Really is there anything better then chicken teriyaki bowl? Ok probably there is but enjoy my chicken and rice! I decided too try the spicy chicken with white rice (they do offer brown rice or noodles as substitutes) and order side of vegetables too. The portion size I was surprised since for  the most part Teriyaki Madness its japanese fast food. You get healthy portion of chicken!! The chicken was cooked on point nice moist with nice grilled marks on the outside. It had little kick too it. Really not much but then again I like spicy food. I really enjoyed the vegetables. Found unlike other places they have better variety of vegetables then your standard broccoli, carrots, or cabbage any combination. Unlike standard teriyaki you can tell take time too saute everything in pan well seasoned not steamed bland vegetables. The mac salad honestly was failure too me. I am just use too local plate lunch style mac salad. Unfortunately this different style just not for me.   Apparently they just renovated the whole interior of the restaurant. You can tell fresh coat of paint all around, and guess the counter area changed it up. Not that big of place but have plenty of seating options inside. I find it interesting tight fit all the tables were from one another. Every table has separate condiments (nice one of them is siracha). They have one television inside if need entertainment.   The staff there is really friendly. They did great job of explaining things too me being first time. Overall really enjoyed it! If looking for an inexpensive meal for lunch or dinner. Teriyaki Madness great choice! They offer lot more stuff on the menu besides your teriyaki bowls. Sure can count on me coming back for more..."}
{"text":"Thank you for reaching out to us in regards to the wait time on our last visit. The food was delicious and understandable when you are training new employees somethings can be missed. We look forward to being back in and good customer service reaching out to someone with an issue!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! But it isn't my favorite teriyaki spot. I ordered the spicy chicken and it was seasoned perfectly but they tend to not give you a lot of teriyaki sauce on your meat. Well this place is known to be healthy so I guess that's fine and anyways they have a bottle of their own teriyaki sauce out on every table and you're more than welcome to pack some up with you if it were a to-go order. I didn't get anything special I just got the plate with their mac salad. But you have tons of options to customize your own plate, like substituting brown rice instead of white, but of course there is an extra charge. The staff isn't really talkative or gives you any suggestions (it was my first time) so I can't really say anything about their customer service. But overall good place, healthy and delicious."}
{"text":"The best teriyaki chicken with brown rice, addicting. The sound system there sounds better than most too with 2 big HD tvs."}
{"text":"Since my last review they have improved and food is always on par. They have happy and positive employees that keep me coming back. My only critique is to check your food before you leave. Sometimes they forget your sides. I order the same thing twice a week and I don't get my salad half the time but I'm so hungry I don't have time to drive back lol. Love the steamed veggies!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by their food & service. Definitely the best mac salad, & the I get the all white breast meat teriyaki bowl extra sauce. The meat is tender & fresh. ALWAYS call ahead of time since they are always busy with phone orders."}
{"text":"Slowest place ever!! Ordered a KIDS chicken teriyaki bowl at 7:07p and as of 7:23p, I still don't have my bowl. Cashier moves like a sloth, people are laughing and joking in the back kitchen and there are six people waiting."}
{"text":"I've been to Teriyaki Madness twice so far and every time I am reminded why I don't frequent TMAD often.   Let's talk about their menu. It is set up like a build your own, which sounds great in the beginning-- who doesn't like to custom their meal? However as you make your choices, make sure that you are prepared to pay for it since everything is an up charge. Sure, its like a $1 or whatever-- but after you pay $12 for a plate of just okay teriyaki you might not feel like those extra dollars was worth it.  Proteins: chicken teriyaki, chicken teriyaki breast, beef teriyaki, orange chicken, chicken katsu, and tofu teriyaki. You can also opt for a two protein meal as well.  A bowl will have stir fry veggies on the side. The plates have a choice of a fresh green salad, mac salad or stir fry veggies.  Base: white rice, brown rice or veggies.  Extras: extra meat $1.99; spicy .50; noodles or fried rice substitution is $1.00  So, in my two visits I have had a spicy chicken and beef plate and a yakisoba plate. The noodles were no bueno-- I would pass on that. Tastes like the instant kind that I could of just made at home. The spicy add-on was well worth the extra charge though.  I feel like all of their business comes from people that are coming from the gym and think they are picking up a healthy meal. I would feel a lot better about their food if the portions were consistent and the price stayed under $10. I didn't even order a drink and my plate was still almost $13 for lunch. Meh."}
{"text":"Oh Teriyaki Madness, how I love thee!!  The food is awesome and the service never disappoints!  My favorite has got to be the low carb plate with chicken. Make that spicy chicken and it becomes amazing! So amazing that I haven't gotten anything else. Yummy sweet and spicy chicken that burns so good and a delicious mix of cabbage, onion, broccoli and my absolute fav--Zucchini!  The only time I've tried other items such as the teriyaki chicken, egg rolls, orange chicken, salad, etc. is when I've been mooching off someone else's plate! :)   For the past seven months, my boyfriend and I have come here at least once a week and have always had an awesome experience! In short, Teriyaki Madness has great service, delicious food and generous portions!"}
{"text":"This place is really good grub. I only gave them 3 stars because I ordered extra chicken and there was No Extra chicken AND the chicken I had was really burnt! I was a little disappointed to pay extra money and not get the value. Still a really good place, just don't order extra chicken because you won't get it!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to for Friday and Saturday nights.  It's located just around the corner from my weekend job, so I'm constantly finding myself here picking up dinner and saving the leftovers for my boyfriend.  They serve great portions and their spicy chicken is flavored extremely well!  The dining area and bathroom are also extremely clean.  And I like how they give packets of sriracha and teriyaki sauce with your to-go order.  (they also have full bottles at every table if you're dining in)"}
{"text":"Wow finally a healthy alternative for fast food.  I love sushi and this place is heaven for sushi lovers who want a quick sushi alternative.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This is probably the most in professional place you can go to this guy that runs the register is just playing around and taking snapchats of another girl and being all up on her I don't wanna see that when I'm eating my food"}
{"text":"I use to be a customer until the owner ripped me off.  I ordered a salmon teriyaki bowl and handed him a 20 dollar bill.  He gave me change for a ten.  I told him I handed him a twenty.  Then I looked at my receipt and it said I gave him 20 and he gave me 10 back.  We got into an argument and I confronted him on the receipt and he said he hit the wrong key on the register.  I asked to see the video and he refused to show it to me.  Then he said he will count the money from the register and if he has extra money he will give me 10 dollars and tell me to leave the restaurant.  Of course he lied after he counted the money and said he was short money.   He yells at me in front of customers.  He is a thief and is extremely unprofessional.  I will never step foot in that place again.  He is the loser.  He lost me as a customer and I have written a bad review.  All over $10."}
{"text":"I had never been & I can't believe no one told me how great this place is. I love the spicy teriyaki chicken while the hubby likes the regular teriyaki. We have since been back several time & have never been disappointed. The last time we didn't even take our meals to go - we actually ate inside. The staff was very nice & the interior was clean & comfortable. We will surely be back many times."}
{"text":"Delicious food, Daisy and the rest of the staff are great. Thank you so much... My parent's normally don't care for teriyaki meals, my son on the other hand loves teriyaki, everyone was HAPPY."}
{"text":"Love the food but for some reason this location always has a weird smell inside. Undescribeable, but not pleasant!"}
{"text":"Love this place first started going off to the one on Warmsprings been going to this one lately just because it's on the way to everything that I do in town always consistent love the spicy beef and chicken combo macaroni salad is out of this world"}
{"text":"I found teriyaki madness on yelp. We are visiting las vegas and wanted to try this place I saw the sign off the freeway. I read the reviews and ordered accordingly. Robert the cashier recommended the crab Rangoon, spicy chicken, green salad. We ordered a lot of food and was very impressed everything was delicious. Robert even gave us some macaroni salad because we couldn't decide. What a great experience and we will be returning everytime we come to visit. Everyone must try TERIYAKI MADNESS and the service was outstanding. Thank YOU Robert for the great experience."}
{"text":"Super good for fast food, especially if you're looking for healthy fast food. You can substitute fried rice/noodles with steamed or stir fry veggies on all Bette bowls/plates if you're looking for healthy options. Quick and healthy, good price for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Cashier was on the phone.  We waited for 8 minutes, and we were never greeted or acknowledged."}
{"text":"They have decent teriaki bowls with veggies in 3 different sizes. I got the tofu & it was pretty good. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh tasty and fast.  And pretty healthy, the service is great our food is alway hot and fresh. I love this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Good for fast Teriyaki. A bit more expensive than Panda.  Better atmosphere and fresher.    $12 bucks for a plate and a drink you may be better off at regular sit down restaurant.  You do get quite a bit however."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations,this one is by far better than  the Mesa location. I came in to this Gilbert location Thursday night I was amazed at how good the food was! The service is amazing as well! The young lady Vanessa up front was helpful and very accommodating. I will be back"}
{"text":"Good food. And you can tell that it is prepared all natural and fresh."}
{"text":"The main dishes are decent, rice and noodles were a little dry, appetizers and sides were basic. Service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Stop. I like this place. I don't want to hear that this place is some generic watered down Japanese food restaurant or something.  I don't think this place was made to be authentic.  It's catering to a broader audience or to first timers who want to get their feet wet with some Asian food, or people who  just want that quick Asian food fix  without the full menu experience  I've had the chicken, beef, pork, and katsu plates. Their house dressing for their salad is unique like a sweet vinegerette. Their gyoza and shrimp tempura is just like what you'll find in any Japanese restaurant.  The food is flavorful and made from scratch and made to order. Sizable portions that are satisfyijng to your belly. Service is quick and courteous. It's great fast food without the grease and the short order cook with a spatula banging on the bell yelling \"Order up!\""}
{"text":"Wow! Took my son there tonight on a buy one get one free bowl. We both had spicy chicken with brown rice and veggies.  First the chicken, perfectly char grilled with crispy goodness, tender with just the right amount of spice.  Next the rice, brown I might add, sticky just perfect for a chicken bowl and easy to use chop sticks with.  Finally the veggies, crisp but not crunchy, soft yet not mushy. Great combo, and great interaction with owner/manager.  We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This one of our favorite places to eat with our kids. The Chicken Teriyaki plate is the perfect size for our kids to share. They love the delicious flavor and the salads that accompany the plates. We normally order an additional salad because they are small portions.     Highly recommend for families on the run for alternative option to fast food. We have always had a positive experience and have been regular customers for years."}
{"text":"Huge portions,  great flavor.  We got the teriyaki chicken with veggies only.  Enough for 2 meals.  Two people for $20.00, you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Patricia has redeemed my faith in this location. She was prompt and courteous on the phone. Prompt and courteous when I came in to pick-up my order. Friendly and accommodating to a modification I requested to my order, and sincere in her concern that it was correct. I have additionally returned several times now without any issues. Hope the location will keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"After waiting 20 mins for our food and not receiving it although other people who came in after us received there's...I asked the girl at the counter how hey do their orders if they go in order by who gets here or if they just do it Willy nilly. The girl responded with she was sorry or order would be up after another order popped up and it was people who had just got there! She then offered us potstickers I refused and asked for a refund saying I don't understand how they do things and she said \"well we aren't a fast food place\" well no joke but when 4 other families who came in after my family get served there is issues!  Never coming back here! Worst experience ever!! If there was a way not to give any stars l would."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and i must say it's pretty good! I have had trouble at a few teriyaki quick serve places like this because of gristly chicken breast but this has been good so far. The service has been friendly each time, and the restaurant is clean enough to be comfortable. I think it's a little pricey for what it is but the servings are decent. If you like veggies, I recommend ordering extra as I feel like they are a little skimpy on them otherwise."}
{"text":"Normally this place is pretty good, but if you modify your order you better check it. You also better make sure you know their terminology. They have my order history, yet constantly forget my extra container of veggies. Today I said I wanted an extra container of veggies, yet they took that to mean \"extra in the one container\". When I got to my car and realized there was only one container of veggies I went back in to ask about it and they gave me a very hard time. They even pulled up my order history and could clearly see that I always pay for two containers of veggies. She told me that because I didn't use the words \"extra SIDE\" and had used the word container instead that she didn't understand me. I will probably eat here again, but I will definitely make sure that whoever is taking my order is clear about what I want.  Update: Shortly after I got home with my meal, Dean (One of the founders of Teriyaki Madness) called me to personally apologize. I was very impressed. We discussed how they were going to improve training and he even put me in the system for a complementary meal. I am VERY proud to know, as a former restaurant general manager myself, that Teriyaki Madness respects and appreciates their consumers. Definitely will keep my teriyaki needs at this location!!!"}
{"text":"The cashier is amazing. Every time you come her you need to ask for kassidee. She's the best there is when it comes to teriyaki madness."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location since it was first opened. I have seen this place branch out with the many franchises. Happy to see places like this grow where you can expect great food all the time.  I usually order spicy chicken, or teriyaki chicken plate.  I tend to order their brown rice and steamed veggies instead of the salad. Sometimes I will order the noodles as a side order.  Their portions are generous so mine usually can last two meals.  The place is clean and simple.  The workers there are always polite.  This is another go to place that I know the food will not disappoint . Been to multiple locations and not one has disappointed me."}
{"text":"The food is great I've been to a few other Teriyaki Madness and I can say it taste more fresh here especially the veggies Usually it's really soggy and heavy but here you can taste the freshness  The portion size is bigger than most, I ordered a bowl but it felt like a plate"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. So good!!! The rice is addicting, best sticky brown rice around. The veggies are fresh! Spicy Chicken Breast Plate is my go to. They do all white meat when requested. This location beats all the other locations in terms of freshness of food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"If there is a better teriyaki chicken place here in Vegas, please let me know because Teriyaki  Madness is awesome!  Had all you need to have here... the Teriyaki Chicken meal w/ steamed white rice and a salad.  Funny how the simplest things are the best and this meal is no different.  Great sauce & chicken definitely make the meal.  Can't wait to go back for more :)"}
{"text":"I've gone MAD for Teriyaki madness!!!  This location is about 8 minutes from my house so it's nice to have a healthy option nearby.  I ordered the orange chicken with steamed rice.  I ask for the orange chicken to be done extra crispy which gives it a crispy texture yet still juicy on the inside.  The mac salad is a great side option to go with the meal, i only wish the side could be a bigger portion.  You get plenty of steamed rice in the bowl as well as chicken.  Great quick place to eat, especially if you call in your order ahead of time as they can get pretty busy being in the same shopping center as EOS fitness gym.  I will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been debating on trying this place because of the mixed reviews, but I finally decided to give it a shot. I wanted to get the chicken, but I noticed a lot of complaints about the chicken being overcooked/undercooked, so I thought it would be safer to go with the tofu teriyaki bowl. (Spoiler alert: it was not.) The tofu looked horribly dry and almost burnt (how does this even happen?). And it tasted about the same. Really rubbery, dry, crunchy in places but not in a good way. I couldn't eat it. The rice was ok. The veggies were kind of mushy and really bland.   The service was good. They were polite and attentive, and the food came out quickly, so at least they have that going for them? But I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food..  I eat here at least 2 times per week.  The spicy chicken bowl is my go to meal.."}
{"text":"They close at 9. I've called at 8:20 for pickup (I live less than a 5 min drive from this location) and they say they close soon so they won't take the order. I eventually got over it and tried them out again. I called tonight at 8:40, hoping they had changed. No answer. If you aren't going to take orders after 8, then close at 8... if you're open until 9; take orders until 9. I work at a a restaurant too, if my employees did that they wouldn't have jobs. Heads up whoever manages this location; your crew doesn't do their job, closes early, and obviously doesn't care about your sales."}
{"text":"Food was okay but expect to wait 20-30 minutes for a bowl...when I ordered one bowl there was one person at the tables waiting for food. Do not go here if you're looking for a quick place to swing by and pick up food."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here.The wait was about 15mins. I order and didn't receive a receipt.  I ask for fried rice and I receive brown rice. So Google their number and call and complain about my food. The young lady that answer the phone as rude and wanted Me to come right back to the restaurant. I wasn't feeling good that day. So I told her I'll come back another day. So the following day I came back to the restaurant with the food. And couldn't get my money back or the food replace.Because I didn't have proof I was there without a receipt. I call the owner and complain. He never call me back. I will not be coming back they provide poor customer service. That was my 1st and last visit. The owner should be ashamed of his self to lead poor leadership. They all need to learn how to respect others. If you choose to go there check your food and ask for a receipt. I was highly disappointed and dissatisfied with their service."}
{"text":"These people are ASSHOLES and have zero customer service skills. They also don't accept cash because they believe it is all counterfeit. Don't waste your time with this bullshit- who cares what the food tastes like!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing teriyaki chicken bowl! I love it , huge portion and great taste . If there was a little bit more veggies it would be perfect but overall very great place."}
{"text":"They are called Teriyaki Madness but they do not accept Teriyaki Madness gift cards.. fail"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but instantly disappointed. First of all customer service needs a big improvement. We had the beef and chicken plate. The beef was good but the chicken seemed rubbery. It wasn't until my boyfriend found hair buried in his rice. We bought this to the attention of the cashier who didn't seem to concerned about it. Instead she just scooped his meat into another plate and gave it back to him. An apology would have been sufficient or perhaps fresh rice. Didn't even get that. All in all we will not be back here. The one star is for the edamame we had as an appetizer."}
{"text":"New to teriyaki.  Love the bowls!  My favorite is chicken, extra veggies, and light noodles!  Edited from previous review."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you'd expect out of the chain. They're not kidding when they say it's addicting. The spicy chicken is the best on the menu, but the orange chicken is also a top contender. It's not so much authentic teriyaki, but it's still really good. 4 stars because there were a couple times the chicken I received was a bit under cooked but that's 1 out 100 times I've been in here."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEatz 3 times. First 2 times were great. Food was PERFECT, order was complete & everything was YUM   The third time, the spicy chicken was burnt, regular chicken was burnt, the fried rice was mostly white, the egg rolls were burnt, missing half our egg roll order, potstickers were burnt, noodles were firm, and stir fried veggies were so undercooked they might as well have been raw. DEF left a lot to be desired. Denise, manager, took our call well. However, Denise did not follow up with us for 3 days after issue regarding \"refund vs food replacement\". In fact, it's still an ongoing issue."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken teriyaki bowl is pretty darn good! The place is new and clean. Service is good and fast. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Madness, when you need quick and awesome Asian cuisine. Hefty portions and awesome grilled flavor-perfect when you need to satisfy cravings. Find teriyaki chicken, yakisoba, potstickers and other treats here! The chicken yakisoba is immense, in portion and flavor. Not at all luxury dining but fabulous for those that need simple and delicious."}
{"text":"Great grilled chicken with rice bowl. 1st time enough for 2 meals or split. Will go back."}
{"text":"We go to this location all the time and never had any problems until last night. They have different staff working there and it shows through their customer service. While ordering one of our entrees, I had made a mistake and corrected what I ordered. Unfortunately when the food came out, it was incorrect. We let the girl know and she proceeded to argue with us and make a big deal. After 3 minutes of the girl staring at the receipt trying to figure out what's wrong rather than listening to me, she said she would fix the order. When she returned with the correct food, she argued with me again about how I should order and how I caused the wrong food to be made. People made mistakes on both sides of this issue, it happens. Just fix the food and move on, I don't need a lecture."}
{"text":"I've been to another Teriyaki Madness location for my first time two days before coming to this location and the food quality was so different, I was so upset. The noodles texture looked and tasted microwaved. A side of chicken cost $7.99. Like what and how ? This location needs work on the service too. The other location greeted me and had a friendly conversation with us since I walked in. The cashier was super friendly and described the dishes and what they came with well. This cashier looked more confused than me. Won't be returning to this specific location but the location on Blue Diamond and Decatur is where I recommend you guys take your service too. The food quality is waaay better and you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOOD!  & love the fact that the teriyaki sauce is endless."}
{"text":"I moved from Vegas a year ago and his was a regular spot I could always count on. Came back for vacation and decided to give it another go, and was pleased as always. I always get the spicy chicken/beef teriyaki plate which is the best of both worlds. Meat cooked perfectly and the sauce is in a category of its own. Never disappointed"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a Teriyaki Bowl on the go. The chicken is nice and tasty and you get good value for the money. On the downside though I found the macaroni salad to be disappointing and the employees at this location are not as friendly as they should be. Overall I would say if you want a quick bite for a reasonable price then this place is a decent enough choice, but if your looking for more quality then you will be disappointed.  Kind of like the McDonald's of T-Bowls."}
{"text":"It's food. Pricybfornwhat it is. Not much flavor. Flame broiler is cheaper and I think better. Wish we had more here. Chicken here 3rd time trying it still dry"}
{"text":"Great food. Healthy choices and stuff the kids really enjoy. The Spicy teriyaki is really tasty without being burn your mouth hot. The orange chicken is also a big favorite. The bowl is just right for a lunch or light dinner, and the plate is a ton of food and really fills you up. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been there before. The one drawback is that it takes longer than you'd think (compared to the black and white bear in a hurry place ;)"}
{"text":"One step above Panda Express....that's about it. The veggies that come with most things are pretty fresh, I will give them that......but that's about all.  This place is probably 3 stars if they lowered the prices, but they just want to upsell you  at every corner of the boring little menu. And for that...yea....I'm taking away a star.  .50c to make it SPICY! Now that's what I call Teriyaki Madness. I have to make it spicy just so I want to eat it.  What next? Napkin fee....Fork upgrade charge....entry fee ($30 guys, $20 girls)?  I will say in their defense, the staff is very friendly, and very helpful and at walking you through the menu and explaining the minute differences between two things that seem identical."}
{"text":"Food's great. Customer service sucks. Not a soul in the place, no one in line, I stood in front of the cashier as he was inputting something into their tablet, and didn't even get an acknowledgement. At least a \"hi, I'll be right with you\" would have been nice. Just as I was getting ready to walk out he acknowledged me."}
{"text":"Over priced I believe and not that great of quality of food I ordered the beef teriyaki when I received the bowl the meat was very hard and dry."}
{"text":"In the past, they were great: great food, quality, customer service, etc. We bought the double $15 groupon and it was always accepted for a party of 3 or 4... No problem.  They established a prescience and because of this, We'd drive all the way out from Dobson to go to this place and use the groupons.    This time they refused to use them because they \"have a new policy\"... So out trip was wasted.  I won't be back and I won't recommend a business with such poor customer service.  And refusing to honor the groupons for a group of 4... We easily could have split up into two groups and they easily could have honored it.  We would have known for next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night assuming in between a rush. It was a fair amount of customers in the lobby waiting for food. As soon as I walked in I Was greeted by the two lovely cashiers. It being my first time here I asked What was good Vanessa said the spicy chicken was the top seller so I decided to trust her judgement and go with the spicy chicken and fried rice for a extra dollar which is not bad. Even tho I had to wait for other customers whom where there before me to receive my food it took roughly about 10 mins which I don't think is that bad. I had my order to go food was still hot when I got home & smelled so good when I opened the lid. Fried rice was cooked to perfection not to mushy not to saucy OMG spicy chicken was amazing just enough spice to make me need a glass of water. I loved it I don't know why everyone else seems to have a problem with it but I will definitely be back and hopefully Vanessa is there to help again."}
{"text":"My husband and I heard about this place from a friend and decided to try it out. We went around 3:00 pm on a Thursday. When we got there the cashier didn't pay no mind to us she was on her phone ; didn't know we were there. We said, \"excuse me\" she turned around quick to take our order. She seemed in a hurry to get us gone. My husband was patient, I walked away with our 5 year old to sit down. Along came a young girl who was smiling at my family. My son threw a wall ball at her and She went to go find it which went under the soda machines. And began to play catch with him. I was so shocked because he has Autism. But he was so willing to play with her. I apologize to her and she said, \"no problem I have time\" I was brought to tears that someone would take the time to play with him for a short amount of time. To make him happy. Later before we were about to leave the same young lady came over to us and give my son, Ryan a pink dolphin and said,\" this always made me happy and I wanna give it to you.\" He laughed and showed mommy! I thanked her and My family will be back because of a great soul. And her name was Ester. (hope I spelt her name right ) what a beautiful soul."}
{"text":"So I placed an order here 2 days ago, they messed up our order and they told us we would get 20 % off our next order for the inconvenience. We go in today and they said they just changed their computer system and have no record of the note the cashier took. They called the manager, Gabriella, and she said there's nothing she could do and to contact corporate with our complaint. It's also messed up there was never an apology or any empathy for the situation. Meanwhile the girls in the business are all talking in Spanish to each other, probably about us, totally disrespectful. Also it's weird there is no manager on duty. I'm soooooo pissed off and will be contacting the BBB and there corporate location."}
{"text":"Can't believe they changed recipe for their katsu sauce. I hate it ! Taste like a brown ginger sauce now . Ruin the experience. Not happy ."}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good.The only down side about comming here was i ended up droping my god damn phone in the toilet .....and had to get a new one :(. But other then that you know lol  Chow mein noodles-Not sure if they had a sauce on them or not but they were very tasty I would for sure order these again,and for a side order they give you enough for 1-2 people Teriyaki chicken bowl- It came with steamed rice but you could pick brown rice if you so  choose,or veggies. The chicken was moist and flavorful and it was freshly made. Glad i came here on the whim that i did,well for the most part lol."}
{"text":"I eat here almost every other day. The food is consistently good and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Despite their good food, I am absolutely never coming back to this location again!   My classmates and I ordered food from here and some skinny, white boy basically threw my food on my table. I don't know if he was having a bad day or what but that attitude was beyond disgusting! I know he did it on purpose too because I said \"excuse me\" to him after he did it and he just turned his back on me like nothing just happened. So much so that my classmate had to get up and ask for his manager. Nothing happened.   One star for their okay food and another for fast service but minus three for the disgusting attitudes of the people who work here."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 10+ times over the past eight months and the food has always been delicious. There are very few quick and healthy options in the area, and the portion size is great (the 'plate' will fill up just about anyone).   Pro Tip: They will do just veggies and meat bowls without rice for no additional charge, which is good if you are watching carbs/calories.   The place is always clean, food is high quality, and it is a good value. Five stars."}
{"text":"We have been to this place twice so far and it has been good both times.  We have had the chicken teriyaki bowls with fried rice, noodles and veggies.  I preferred the noodles over the fried rice, but my husband liked both.  Mine was without veggies, but he said they were perfectly cooked.  The chicken has been cooked nicely and I really like the teriyaki sauce they use.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because both times the employees have not been overly friendly or welcoming.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for teriyaki chicken and everything they offer. We love going here. I've been coming for years now and it is always a top option for fast food restaurants, buy only this location. I love the noodles here. Will keep coming. Never had a problem with them. The food is always on point and the service is great! ;-)"}
{"text":"There food is good, but the service is so mind numbingly slow. We've been several times because my son loves it. I always swear I'm never going back. Here I am tonight, waiting almost 20 minutes for my food. They aren't even busy."}
{"text":"This location needs to update their hours or at least the hours as listed on yelp should show this place closed. After a 14 hour shift on a Sunday i really wanted some yummy teriyaki chicken only to be disappointed and forced to get fast food because the location was closed up at 630pm when i arrived instead of 10pm like the website and yelp said"}
{"text":"BLUF: You get the Madness when you get the total.  I like to think of this as haole style oriental food.  The problem I have with it is that it's way too expensive.  The g/f and I got a combo plate with spicy chicken and teriyaki chicken with white rice, some stir fry veggies (which was 80% cabbage) and one small soda.  Some how that came out to over $11.  I guess that's where it gets the \"madness\" in it's name.  The food was good, but not so great that I would call it 'addicting' or justify the price.  The portions were small for what we ended up getting.  My g/f said that it was about 2/3's the size of the portion that she got when she came here before.    The food was like going to Panda Express, except the chicken was cooked fresh.  So in my opinion, it was not worth the Madness of the cost."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was most excellent!!! Pot stickers and egg rolls are great!! Very accommodating."}
{"text":"So happy to have a TM near us! We had lunch on Thursday and the place was clean, good service and of course delicious food. The owner came up to talk with us and she was very sweet and excited to be in the area too! Looking forward to mannnyy more visits"}
{"text":"Um, edible, barely.  2 chicken breast / rice bowls, 1 orange chicken noodle bowl. Sodas for 3. $31.  Chicken breast was overlooked and dry. Unseasoned except for some very thick and pasty teriyaki sauce spooned over the top (almost tasted like pure hosin sauce.) Orange chicken soggy and underwhelming. Rice was mushy. Veggies were just ok.  Nice decor inside and pleasant service, which is why I didn't give them a 1."}
{"text":"I eat at this place like once a week. Always good. Big portions!  Menu is simple, service is quick, and staff is friendly. Highly recommended for a quick bite"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.   Able to eat semi healthy for around $10 and enjoy it is a definite plus. Had a spicy chicken bowl over veggies and was happy to eat it. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Food was enjoyable and there was plenty. I just hate when restaurants cheapen the quality of the meat. The steak used to be actual steak but is now a cheap philly steak type of thing and charging for the sauce that used to be put on the food is a bit much as well."}
{"text":"2-10$ combo plates (spicy chicken & spicy teriyaki beef)  Looks like I paid 20$ for 2 trays of white rice!! If you look closely in 1 of the pictures, they added more rice in the meat tray and placed meat on top to give me less of a portion of meats!!  And they forgot my side dish that of macaroni salad!! I've added pictures in a post to this as well so you all can see"}
{"text":"Ok seriously, I rarely ever post reviews. But if they mess up your order for a pickup. Then you call and drive to get a new one and that bowl is still not good. That's bad, I'm upset because I used to love coming here. The first spicy chicken bowl I received when I got home the chicken was dry, burnt sauce not good at all. I call and tell them about this and the guy on the phone just laughs and says \"I'm sorry, I can give you a coupon for a 20% discount for next time.\" Ummmm no. I'm hungry now.. So I told him I would come in with the bowl and show them so they can replace it. I get their frustrated already the cashier wasn't very nice and had resting bitch face. Whatever. I get home and same crap. If I'm going to pay  $10 for a spicy chicken bowl come on dude. It should be pretty decent. I could've got a better one from jack in the box for half the price.. Never again. They need to get their shit together and hire better cashiers with good customer service. Same with the cooks."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place at all. The girl at the front register named isabell took my order and was really rude. She gave me the worst attitude and when I wanted to add something on my order, she gave me a dirty look and ignored me. After all that, I was waiting for my food when I saw her go back into the kitchen to say something to the cook I'm assuming? After I got my food, I found 3 long pieces of hair in my chicken :-) so, if you want your food spot in and hair found in, I suggest this place.  If not I recommend elsewhere!  Update: spoke with the management team and they handled this situation very well. Thanks Dean, again for all your help."}
{"text":"Glad there's one near chinatown! Pretty small place but food is hella good. Kudos to the man who always have this high energy to talk to customers. Seems like he's the owner! I'll be back in a few days!!"}
{"text":"This location is conveniently located right off the 95, perfect for grabbing a quick bite to eat on my way home from work, which is usually the case.  It's never busy here and the staff is really friendly, making small talk while your order is being prepared.  My personal favorite is the Spicy Chicken bowl with brown rice and stir-fried veggies. The chicken is juicy and already flavorful as is, but I always add extra Sriracha to it. Can't forget about the house-made teriyaki sauce either! If you like spicy flavors and you're looking to try something other than the original teriyaki chicken, I would definitely suggest the Spicy Chicken Bowl.  The food at Teriyaki Madness is always fresh and made to order. A regular sized bowl is very filling and the prices here are reasonable. So glad to have a location closer to home!"}
{"text":"If my coworkers and I are looking for something quick to eat during our lunch hour, this is one of our go-to spots.   It can get pretty busy during lunchtime, seeing as to how there are plenty of businesses and offices in the surrounding area, but the service here is fairly quick. We are usually in and out in less than 15 minutes. Our orders are always taken to go because of how crowded it can get.  My personal favorite is the Spicy Chicken bowl with brown rice and stir-fried veggies. The chicken is already flavorful as is, but I always add extra Sriracha and the house-made teriyaki sauce! I would definitely recommend the Spicy Chicken bowl.  The food at Teriyaki Madness is always fresh and made to order. It's a very filling meal and the prices here are reasonable."}
{"text":"From the second, we walked in Brianna was nothing but smiles. She treated me and my girlfriend like we were royalty. It was our first time here and she was delightfully helpful. Her smile could light up the whole strip. We will be coming again just because of her. The food was great and the first time I've had Asian food without the guilt"}
{"text":"Came in the cashier was not friendly at all asked is they had vegetarian fried rice she was a little hesitant but answered back with some attitude and she also rang me up wrong and she noticed it and I commented about it she said nothing and the food here is no t that great we got old dry rice our veggies where hardly cooked don't know if they where just trying to go home or hate their job but thats none of my business all I know is they need more training on customer service I go to the location on Lakemead which is way better even when busy and this location was dead. Horrible I'll stick to my usual location."}
{"text":"Food is always good.  Service is great and place is clean! I am a regular."}
{"text":"I tried Teriyaki madness for the first time yesterday. It was so good. I got a Chicken Teriyaki plate, $9.99 and a drink, came to about $13 something total. Their teriyaki sause was very good. Will return and try more items!"}
{"text":"Always great to eat here! Call ahead to order for pickup for my lunch during the work week. The spicy teri chicken with brown rice and veggies is my usual. Ask for extra sauce if needed but usually they give me extra. Sometimes it gets busy during lunch. Not bad though:)"}
{"text":"We were really impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.  We both ordered the spicy chicken, while our friends tried the regular teriyaki and a combo of spicy chicken and orange chicken.  The portions are huge, with all in our party taking home enough food for another meal.   The restaurant was not busy on a Saturday night, though they did have a steady stream of take-out orders.   We hope they consider opening a location near Matthews, NC."}
{"text":"One of my favorite for quick healthy take out. I have ordered from here dozens of times, and have never had any issues"}
{"text":"We love this place,  been coming here for years and the quality is spot on every time.  If your getting take-out call ahead and they will have in ready for you in minutes."}
{"text":"Called at 9:54pm to grab a quick bowl to go. I was informed they wouldn't take my order even though they don't close til 10pm. Welcome to bad employed, bad customer service and poor attitudes. Doesn't surprise me. But they've lost My business. I hope others don't patronage business with poor service"}
{"text":"I love the spicy chicken teriyaki low carb plate. It's a different take on Japanese food. The vegetables very good w the cabbage. Try it!  The yokisaba and the regular chicken teriyaki plates are very good as well.  Good quality ingredients and it shows in the final product.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has bad reviews! I liked it! I've been here 2x.  I came here on a recommendation of a few friends and because I had a Groupon, $10 for $20. They will take it directly from your phone.  I ordered the 2 meat combo, about $8. Teriyaki chicken and beef were soooo good! My boyfriend really liked spicy chicken. It was delish!   Did I mention they have unlimited teriyaki sauce? Yum-o!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I pick up from this location at least once a week. I've only ever had the spicy chicken plate but it's so good I don't want to try anything else. Always friendly, super quick service. :)"}
{"text":"A friend and I were in the area for the weekend and ate here a couple of times for lunch. Staff were helpful and friendly. Prices are reasonable, (vegetarian under $10) with many options for most diet types... vegetarian and meat eaters. Pick and choose what goes in your meal...rice or noodle, veggies, meat, etc. Service was quick each time and portions were healthy. Flavorful enough to eat as-is or you can add extra teriyaki sauce that's bottled at your table. They even have kid-friendly chopsticks with forks on the other end, aka CHORK :) I can see parking being a pain during the weekly lunch rush but we had no issues over the weekend."}
{"text":"Food quality was good, email liters were nice and the wait time wasn't bad even at the middle of lunch hour rush. The only negative is the forgotten items but again they were super busy so it is understandable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken katsu! I usually don't like fried food but the chicken was white meat! Yummy! Shared it with my son. The portion size is large and the price is reasonable!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot - The lo-carb chicken spicy plate is my favorite dish. The yakisoba is good, and the chicken egg rolls great. The cool thing is you can add spice at the level you like. They know me by name - I've been going here on a regular basis for about the last 2 yrs!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy their food a lot. The bowls are well filled with food, they dont skimp on anything. Their shrimp tempura is very very good. for fast food asian food. excellent."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken is amazing. Double meat? Yes please."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! They just added a new salmon entree and boy do I hope it stays! Amazingly good. Step up from traditional takeout or fast food. Asian flare with goodness (and swiftness). Great service and clean....friendly."}
{"text":"Second time coming and more in love. Definitely an upgrade from a standard takeout. Wanted to review again and update my experience. From the manager reaching out for community input to the newly added salmon....superb! Great food when you want that step up from mall cuisine but not a traditional Chinese/Japanese restaurant."}

{"text":"good food good service. i eat here 3 times a week....spicy chicken is a must... brown rice alqays on point"}
{"text":"place is money.love the renovations.spicy chicken allll day"}
{"text":"didnt even know this was here.glad i do.fresh fast and healthy after a good workout"}
{"text":"hidden gem.perfect healthy meal after a long gym session"}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER. If you don't try, you are missing out! The cashiers are very sweet and helpful. Kitchen staff gets things done quickly. Very clean and calm place to have lunch or dinner with friends or family."}
{"text":"2 weeks ago ordered takeout at the wigwam and pecos store in henderson nv. they forgot our little tiny cup of macaroni salad. called back and they said we can get a free one on our next order. so called up to order tonight and the manager marco tells us that when they forget people's food, the policy is to throw away the note after 1 week that says what people are owed. so over 1 little cup of salad, they lost are business for good. beware, you must double check your bag before you walk out or they will happily pocket your money and save the food."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot. The food is fresh and really good. Only complaint is that the place is really small, like where they only have 4 tables small. Best bet would be to call your order in for pick up and eat it elsewhere. The staff is really nice and friendly. I'll gladly go any day of the week"}
{"text":"Great food and service. This is the perfect spot for after work or the gym. AJ and the others are always very friendly!"}
{"text":"My food was soooooo good! I found them online and took a chance. Delicious! If you want less rice, just let them know and they'll give more veggies. Oh and excellent customer service. The manager walked around and ask everyone how they were. He was very nice to me! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time here! Wasn't too bad. Ordered the teriyaki chicken with veggie bowl with brown rice. Everything was fresh!"}
{"text":"Came here first time. Don't believe the coupon. Even though the coupon doesn't state it must be printed, and says no photocopies, they require it to be printed. She offered a \"small\" discount but couldn't apply the coupon because it wasn't printed. How ridiculous. Lady at the counter wasn't rude necessarily, but was impersonal and not customer service oriented. Not likely to return.  Follow up after getting food: daughter got chicken terriyaki bowl and the chicken was good. I got the orange chicken, tried about 3 bites and hard to return to exchange. It was extremely over cooked and chewy."}
{"text":"The best teriyaki in town :) finally one that's in center Vegas :) highly recommended fast food"}
{"text":"This is my favorite... My version of fast food. I always order the spicy chicken with brown rice and extra side salad, mix them all together with their low fat sesame dressing and voila... A magical meal!!! It doesn't hurt to have a NY bagel next door as well!!"}
{"text":"Today i was very dissatisfied with my order. I placed an order through door dash, my food arrived on time,however,  all the chicken was burnt. I ordered a spicy chicken bowl , spicy chicken plate,  two egg rolls. This is the second time this happed and it really sucks because this is one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"For fast food, I enjoy the veggies and flavors. Simple, healthier options that are tasty."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness is my guilty pleasure. It basically serves up my ideal meal - meat and rice. I usually get the teriyaki chicken and white rice bowl with a side of pork gyoza. The chicken is tender and moist. They use the really starchy type of short grain rice. It's perfectly cooked, nice and fluffy with the right amount of stickiness. Their sauce is pretty good and I like to put extra all over my chicken. The gyoza is deep fried and I would recommend blotting it with a napkin if you don't want the extra oil in your diet. I have yet to try any of the other menu items but the katsu looks delicious. As far as portion size goes, one order of the teriyaki chicken is usually lunch and dinner for me.  I do like this location better than the one on Craig. Since it is new, it is quite a bit fresher looking. The restaurant is also more open. The staff is very pleasant and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Don't eat here! The chicken breast was some horrible processed like texture, super rubbery but white all the way through. I had my roommate try it to confirm and he spit his out in a napkin. Do yourself a favor a Find a samurai Sams. Manager on duty on 5/26/17 at 3:00pm needs to be replaced"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness is just what Metropolitan needed. Think of a higher-end Panda express. You pick your protein then add rice (white/fried), noodles or veggies plus veggies or a salad. I went with the Teriyaki chicken bowl with white rice and veggies to-go.   My meal was made to order and was served nice and hot- still had smoke coming off of it when I got home. The chicken was moist and the homemade Teriyaki sauce was bomb. The veggies were a mix of cabbage, carrots, onions, broccoli and zucchini, which I really liked. My rice was similar to sushi rice, which I really enjoyed because it was easier to eat with chopsticks. My bowl was pretty big and easily enough for 2 meals, but I was super hungry and ate it all... #noregrets  The inside of this place reminded me of a Chipotle. Very clean and subtle decor, but I mostly enjoyed their signage. The had pretty funny signs handing around the dinning area such as \"Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy spicy chicken\" and \"I like big bowls and I can not lie.\" Gotta love that!  Overall, I really enjoyed Teriyaki Madness and will return soon. My meal was around $9 total, but I had a coupon so it was free :-)"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best and most fresh vegetables and teriyaki bowls in town!  I love this place. I used to go to samurai Sam's but the one near my work closed at random. That obviously didn't make me too happy but after trying Terryaki Madness I wasn't sad for long. I love that you can customize your bowl and they have a variety of different options including some Hawaiian dishes. It's always clean and smells good in the restaurant in the bathrooms believe it or not look great. That's a very important thing! What that tells me is that they do not only pay great attention to their food, but they also pay a lot of attention to the ancillary things that other restaurants let go. After the gym this is a protein in carb pack power lunch. Great for energy and increasing your metabolism! I highly recommend it especially for health goers. The only thing that I would try to find out is do they sell organic? Is there food non-GMO? That's important for me so I hope I get the answers I'm looking for.  Terryaki Madness has a variety of locations across the city. And they were voted the best of Las Vegas. Check them out! I guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The portions are smaller than they were.   The chef Refuses to make the chicken crispy, no matter how you beg.   Small portions, under cooked chicken..... not worth the drive. Yes, and lunch without drink is about $13................."}
{"text":"I have been coming here frequently for the last few years and the food has always been great but progressively over the last year the customer service has gotten flat out lousy. While ordering whoever is helping you carries an attitude that makes you feel like you're patronage is an inconvenience to them. You never feel like they're fully paying attention to you and lately when you get home and open your order, you find they weren't and your order is incomplete. To top off the rude customer service, it's always nice to hear thank you when putting cash in the tip jar and I almost never do. I won't be coming to this location anymore with their sub par customer service."}
{"text":"First and last time I'm going to eat here.$10 for a teriyaki plate... Nothing special about their teriyaki. Side of Macaroni salad terrible, uncooked bits and pieces with a bland taste. Other Items are even pricey."}
{"text":"I like this location because it is on my way home. The food is fresh and hot and after a long day at work (where the EDR sucks), it is very convenient . The other reason that it is mostly take out for me is that this location feels very cramped. The store is quite small with most of the seating packed into the front. There is a long section down the side with some tables but it makes me feel claustrophobic. The staff's attitude is a bit more business friendly; kind of get the overtone of \"pay, take your food and go\" rather than \"hey nice to see you again.\" But I really can't knock it, cause that is what I am there for anyway - takeout. And as far as the food goes, if my order is right, fast and yummy I have no complaints."}
{"text":"We didn't think we were going to like it, but we were wrong. Besides being a little upset because they wouldn't take my coupon I just received for some reason the manager couldn't figure it out to input in the system. The prices were kinda high, but we were trying some place new we ended up happy with our meals.  The chicken teriyaki plate which was my choice was amazing, fresh, enough sauce, very tasty. Also had both rice and noodles, yum."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch and had a really good experience! The restaurant was very clean and the food was excellent.   I had the spicy chicken with fried rice and vegetables. I absolutely loved the sauce on the chicken. Just the right amount of flavor and heat. The fried rice was a good combination too. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is decent if you want that teriyaki fix. I usually get the two item combination plate. Its your choice of any two meats. Comes with steamed rice and salad. I usually get brown rice instead of white and macaroni salad instead of their basic house salad.  I paid a total of 10.53 for this meal. That doesn't include drinks. You would think that paying 10 bucks for lunch would get you somewhat of nice size portion but I finished my meal with no problem. I think they don't give you enough meat and the rice was like two small scoops. They also charge you extra for brown rice.   Dont get me wrong. The food is good but the portions and the price gets two stars subtracted. Also a couple times my coworkers got food poisoning after eating here for dinner. They were up at 4 in the morning hanging out in the bathroom. Im surprised I havnt got sick yet for I have eaten here several times. I think sometimes they cook the meats too fast and not cook it long enough.   Service is ok and the overall size of the place is pretty good to handle the lunch and dinner crowds. They are kind of tucked away in a plaza just off the 215 and Stephanie exit.   So overall, If I can just get a little more food for the price I pay that would make things perfect. Either that or lower the price a bit because spending 10 bucks for lunch a day is considered a luxury for some people."}
{"text":"Quick in and out of this place.  Consistent with the other two locations I reviewed. My sister and I got the 1/2 spicy chicken, 1/2 chicken katsu combination plate with brown rice and an extra katsu sauce for the both of us.  They took a while to get it going, but the food came out fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I had this last night for dinner! ALWAYS so bomb! never disappoints especially after a great workout! The people were extra nice too. local place near my home i will be back!"}
{"text":"There is something really wrong with this place.  The food is good - maybe even exceptional for \"fast\" food, but it's slow to the point of incompetence.  It's also full of zombies just shuffling around waiting for their food that has obvious taken so long that their brains have shut down.  I have eaten here two or three times now on various days - each time there has been some reason that it took 45 minutes to an hour to make a teriyaki bowl.  Today's excuse was that they were 'slammed'.  I called ahead (was told 15 min) and waited 30 min in the place after that when I got there.  During that time \"slammed\" meant 1 other person ordered and 5 people stumbled and bumped into each other in the kitchen. Yes they got online orders but nothing to account for this side show of inefficiency."}
{"text":"The place is quick and nice customer service. The texture of the avocado is a little off and for a 1.50 you should get a more avocado, but that's fine. People gotta make money. I love the spicy chicken bowl with brown rice and steamed veggies. The teriyaki sauce is delicious. This is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Their teriyaki and other dishes are simply delicious, the only thing I don't like is (sometimes) the wait... But great food so I guess it's worth it, I always get chicken breast with either yakisoba or white rice, I like the great amount of veggies they serve. One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"I came here at first with my sister and her boyfriend when I was at this side of town.   I had no idea that the food here is comparable to Samurai Sams. I loved this location's chicken katsu and their chicken teriyaki. The spicy chicken is similar at every location.  I have to say that they give you a LOT of food for the cost. I prefer coming here instead of the competing locations in terms of similar food for the money."}
{"text":"I always get the 1/2 spicy chicken and 1/2 chicken katsu plate with brown rice and a house salad.  I love that for $9.50 this place can fill you up, give you enough of a spice from the chicken and make you addicted to the food. The associate here is always very helpful. He wears glasses, but I forgot his name. Call and order for pick-up if you are impatient with waiting for food. The wait is always about 10 minutes.  The chicken katsu is just decent at best, but the spicy chicken is delicious! I love it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to stop at while in Vegas. I just went yesterday and got a chicken yakisoba plate to go. Haven't been back in months since moving to CA. It's still amazing! Food is always made fresh, made quickly and delicious. Location is good. There is plenty of parking and easy to find."}
{"text":"Food was only ok... had to wait 20+ min for our food, girls at the counter we lazy/slow and had attitude the entire time. When the girl called my name she said my name 3 different ways back to back with a sarcastic tone when after the first time I acknowledged it was me and then I got zero apology for the wait. I then ordered a double meet plate and was given one sauce and zero offer for another one.  I will no longer visit this location for any reason as the  other locations I've been to in town know how to give good customer service. Either area management needs to get new employees and shut that store down. I hope that the location stays open but they fire everyone as there were many people in there waiting for the food, but all were annoyed."}
{"text":"The foods okay, employess are crappy and the night crew CONSTANTLY closes early. Such a waste of time to go there and find out they closed 30 minutes sometimes even an HOUR early. Went there at 9:30 tonight after work and guess what? CLOSED. Its like the 7th time, ridiculous. I work close by and it happens constantly. Just freaking change the hours of operation if you insist on closing before you're supposed to."}
{"text":"Been to the Teriyaki Madness in Dallas TX and this location definitely is better with the quality of chicken and how they make it. Super good! I would've given 5 stars the but staff can be a little more friendlier on the phone and in person."}
{"text":"When I am really hungry, this is the place I come and vacuum the food  Good quality and great service.  It gets crazy on lunch time. It's okay because food is good :)"}
{"text":"God food and great service but the price is high.  We could eat at a sit down service place for the same price"}
{"text":"consistent and decent portion sizes, plus it is better and cheaper then Panda.  So hands down i will continue to visit the Madness of Teriyaki."}
{"text":"When i went, they had their doors wide open and people were standing outside waiting on their food cuz it smelled really really bad in there. I have no idea how some people sat there and ate their food in there, but man... the odor just bugged me. I had crab rangoon, which was decent. it wasnt the best, but it wasnt the worst. I'll update my review next time i get a chance to go there and eat a meal. It seems like they dont really have as many options on their menu as i expected, but I'll give them another shot."}
{"text":"No where does it in Vegas like these guys. They have one main competitor Samurai Sam's. The quality here @ Teriyaki madness is much higher only problem is no brown rice if you want rice.. I always order the low carb plate. Big portions pretty healthy. The food comes out super fast. Always consistent and excellent lunch option for a quick bite that will keep u full all day or give you left overs got later.  Update There is Brown Rice Now! And Still #1 for Asian Stir Fry FAST"}
{"text":"After I had posted my review of this TM location, I was surprised when the owner of the restaurant contacted me, to not only apologize for the bad experience but to ask that I give it another shot.  I was thoroughly impressed that he made an effort to read each review and tried to improve upon a negative experience.    Since I love the food and the location is very convenient for me, I decided to give it another try.  I was also happy to hear that the employee that I had bad dealings with was no longer working there.    This time the overall experience was great.  The food was ready when I arrived and everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The brown rice was cooked nicely, the stir-fried vegetable and the salad were fresh, and the spicy chicken was moist and delicious.  I will be going back to this location on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Picked up diner at this location that is very convenient for me, the gentlemen that helped me was very sweet and helpful. Food always taste amazingly fresh. The owner Randy is a very nice down to Earth sweet gentlemen to talk to, and is doing a good job with his team.   Thank you."}
{"text":"I visit this place at least twice a week right next to the gym so super convenient. I always get chicken teriyaki no sauce with vegetables and white rice . Good for you at an affordable place.  Such a great alternative to some fast food joint . Plus they have Stevie packet s for your tea . For me a big deal. Unless something changes they have my business !!!"}
{"text":"I love Teriyaki bowls,  They have these little franchises around the valley.  You get a good sized portion and they have various options.  I go to this one because it's by my work. It can get pretty crowed at lunch. There are usually a couple workers who are doing back flips in the kitchen.  The only complaint I have with this location is it usually takes a long time to get your food.  The last few times I have gone I noticed that people where picking up called in orders.  I always forget to do that.  This is why I only gave them 3 stars.  The food is great though!  Get the spicy chicken bowl and add veggies.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been so excited to try this place.  Im not writing it off yet, but I just got a to-go order, was assured several times that the spicy chicken was all white meat chicken breast...it's not.  So I'm eating just veggies and rice for dinner, which is fine, but I'm still annoyed.  And, to top it off, I asked for white rice and got brown rice.  Again, not a huge deal, but annoying.  The employees need to know the menu."}
{"text":"I liked this place came with family and everyone loves the food! The plate was enough food for my husband and I and he's a big guy. Great value ! We will be back  Spicy chicken YUM !"}
{"text":"I normally go to Warm Springs and Durango but today I swung by this one. Mistake. I ordered 3 plates, one of which was Orange Chicken, fried rice and veggies. Apparently that translates to chicken teriyaki with noodles and veggies. So thanks for screwing up a simple order, looks like I need to stick to my normal location.  Just need to update this. Randy the owner reached out to me and apologized, he also made things right. It's customer service like this that has me coming back. Mistakes happen, it's what the follow up that happens after that really matters. Randy provided that follow up and because of that is keeping me as a customer."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for a while now and last night was my first and only time going here. I walked in and as soon as I walked in the cashier welcomed me and as I was walking to the counter asked what can I get for you today? At first I thought that was nice but I felt rushed and I haven't even looked at the menu yet. After I ordered to go, which now I'm glad I did, the cashier and her helper started talking about smoking weed, girls where high school age. The helper was talking about how her boyfriend and how he is a lightweight and it doesn't take much for him to get high. The cashier was talking about how she is planning on getting high after close. The two cooks chimed in as well. Then the girls started to talk about the boys they have made out with. One girl made out with this guy in seventh grade and again in ninth grade and he sucked. So if your name is Chad and you are super rich and in high school, sorry the girls agreed you suck at making out. The cooks started talking about how they would be better than those guys. While they are talking they are dropping f bombs and listing to music really loud with cursing in it, again nothing wrong with the music just not a good idea with customers in the lobby. The cooks who one had a face tattoo, nothing against tattoos, was more interested talking to his buddy about future face tats then making my food. I waited fourteen minutes for my food. The veggies where super dry and old, chicken tasted burnt, and the crab ragoons where not cooked all the way, my wife's food tasted old and stale as well. I will never go there again. Maybe daytime staff is better. I get it they where teenagers but if I was the manager and found out my staff talked like and acted like that with customers around I would be livid, maybe this manager doesnt care and maybe one of those people there was the manager. Either way save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!  I am in LOVE! This is it! THIS is what I've been looking for since I moved out to Las Vegas almost 7 years ago!  All of these other Teriyaki places I've been checking out have been alright, but nothing spectacular. Certainly nothing to warrant a repeat visit. That all changed a couple of hours ago!  This location is just south of Silverado Ranch Blvd on Maryland Parkway right in front of the 24 hours Fitness. After my workout today at that 24, I decided to finally check this place out, so I walked across the parking lot and walked inside. The place was on the smaller side and pretty close to fully occupied. Thats a good sign that they offer a good product. I placed my order for a Chicken Teriyaki bowl, they took my name, and I had a seat. Less than 5 minutes later I had my food.  And...WOW! Perfect! Alot of juicy, tasty meat over a solid bowl full of white rice with teriyaki sauce poured over it! YUMMY! Best part, no pesky veggies to get in the damn way! Hell yea! That bowl never stood a chance!   Prices were incredibly reasonable. I will most certainly be back for multiple visits! Hell, I may even go back today! Damn that was good!  Foregone conclusion...but..  5 super duper power mega stars!"}
{"text":"When I lived over in the area of Maryland Parkway and Silverado Ranch Blvd., I used to be a frequent patron of the TM in front of the 24 Hour Fitness! I loved it! Had it at least 2-3 times a week!  Fast forward about 9 months and it's been a while since I last had a wonderful teriyaki chicken bowl from Teriyaki Madness....that is, up until tonight. You see, I never realized that I had one around the corner from my new place of residence until just a few weeks ago! I was pumped to go enjoy another brimming bowl of pure bliss and tastiness!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqgW-2orQQg  Wow! What a letdown!  This TM location actually has a pretty nice sized dining area with a couple of TV's (playing playoff basketball when I came in tonight, btw...nice!). The young lady who took my order was friendly and very cordial. I go to sit down and wait for my to-go order, while catching some NBA playoff hoops. Less than 5 minutes later, my food is ready! Sweet!! I am LOVING this place!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqgW-2orQQg  When I get home and get ready to dig in and do some damage...this is what I see..  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teriyaki-madness-las-vegas-9?select=1AqyzACkewpQECTVEFIFBQ  OK, um....where is the rest of it?? This is easily the skimpiest portion I have ever received at a TM. For almost $8 for a chicken bowl, can I please get some more rice, at least??? What was there tasted great, especially the meat...but I was definitely shortchanged in the portion department tonight!  I honestly wish I could say I'll give them another shot, but you have sooo many great options in the area to choose from...why roll the dice with a place that has no problem shorting their customers??  Disappointing.  I've definitely experienced MUCH better ....even at other Teriyaki Madness locations.  2 stars.  One and done."}
{"text":"We used a Groupon and will come back again...even without a discount!  We thought the portions were big and prices fair.  The food was pretty good for being a fast food type restaurant.  The employees were very nice and hospitable.  I really liked my chicken teriyaki and my husband liked his pork.  Great salad dressing on the salad."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant very informed front-line people made great suggestions easy to order from the menu very friendly delicious delicious delicious food quantity is big and well worth the money I'll be coming back here often!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I like the spicy chicken bowl after a good workout. Customer service could use a little work but other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Place was clean and the folks friendly, but....the beef teriyaki bowl was merely acceptable. I had hoped for tasty, or great, but it was not to be. The beef had a teriyaki flavor but not much, and it was a bit tough. Surprisingly, the noodles were a bit tough too. Not so bad I didn't want to finish it, not so good that I want to come back. Tasted no better than the oriental vendors at the mall.  My wife had the crab ragoon and shrimp tempura appetizers for dinner. She agrees they were good enough to finish, but also not good enough to come back."}
{"text":"Want something freshly made and with good flavor!  This is the place!  First timer and it was delicious.  Looking for a teriyaki spot here is the place to go! I would recommend for you to ask double on meat because me being a big boy wasn't enough but other than that it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here with a coupon for a free entree with purchase of two large drinks and an entree. We ordered two Yakisoba entrees (about $8 ea.), 6 pieces of gyoza ($3), and two large drinks to go. I'm glad we came in when we did (12:15pm) because, just a few minutes after we ordered, they had their lunch rush and the line got very long. We just had to wait about 5 minutes for our food and they gave us lots of containers, so we could load up on Sriracha. They included forks, teriyaki and gyoza sauce, lots of napkins, and chopsticks in our to go bag. When we got home and took out our entrees, the first thing I noticed was how large the portions were. The Yakisoba was put in an average white Styrofoam container, but it was PACKED with the noodles; More than enough for lunch AND dinner. There were lots of grilled chicken pieces and zucchini, which I loved. I'll admit, it wasn't oozing with flavors or anything, but it tasted delicious after I dumped some Sriracha and teriyaki sauce on it. I really loved the Gyoza though. So fresh and so perfectly cooked with a nice little crisp on the outside. For less than 3 bucks for 6 pieces, it's quite a deal. Our whole meal for the both of us came out to $16 because of the coupon I had. If I ever came back, I'd probably stick to getting just a bowl though, unless I'm going to share because the plates/entrees are very large.    Tip *Text \"TMAD\" to 53535 for some deals!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is always delicious. My kids and hubby are picky but they do enjoy coming here:) The restaurant its self is very nice and a perfect corner location."}
{"text":"Very good.  Awesome teriyaki,  healthy ,quick meal. Had the teriyaki chicken, white rice was great. Next time will try the teriyaki beef.           The teriyaki sauce is delicious...  We have a location in Colleyville Tx now."}
{"text":"This is one of the very few teriyaki places that I could just never get tired of!  Their fried rice is by far my favorite fried rice of all time, & I could say the same about the Chicken Teriyaki.  Great atmosphere- I highly recommend trying this place if you haven't!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I highly recommend a bowl with only broccoli as the vegetable. Their broccoli is so fresh & their food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Once again worst customer service ever. The \"manager\" Derek was looking forward to arguing with both my husband and I when we called to let them know they once again got our order wrong(3rd time). Derek really needs some customer service training!  His response was \"oh well it happens\". If a meal is wrong replace the entire meal so you have an opportunity to fix the Customer's experience. Not the side item they forgot to include. I would've given a higher review if my order was right and the manager was looking to do his job. For the first time tonight I thought the cashier was nice (must be new). Every other time I walk in there they act like they don't want customers to come in because then they will have to work."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Our food has always been on point. My favorite is the spicy chicken plate. The portions are HUGE and can be easily two meals in one and often times that is the case for me. It's a great deal! A plate costs about $10 and the quality of the food is amazing!! It's not your average \"Chinese\" take-out. So if you're looking for deep fried fast food with 2000 calories for $4 this is not the place for you. It's truly made fresh so prepare for a short wait but it's so worth it.  The fried rice is pretty freakin great! The brown rice was just okay to me. I usually order double veggies with my chicken and opt out of the rice but if you want rice I highly recommend the fried. There's $1 up-charge for it but again it's worth it.  I'm so happy this place is close to home. I just wish they had more locations around. I've gone to the Midtown location but Mallard Creek is the best out of the two for me."}
{"text":"I have a new spot for Fresh Asian-Style food!!! I ordered the two protein, Teriyaki Chicken/Beef with Noodles and Veggies. It was delicious! Service is great as well! Great spot! Do not be afraid to try!"}
{"text":"There was a line of 4 people and the employee was cleaning tables.  So he finished the table fine. He walks back behind the counter and proceeds to drop the wash cloth in the water container.  Shockingly, he rings the cloth out and goes back to finish other tables. This was 30 minutes before closing time and clearly valuing getting out of there faster over the customers.  I walked out and haven't been back."}
{"text":"Ordered a plate with spicy chicken and teryaki beef.. It was great but I miss the teriyaki pork so they only got a 4 star because I'm still waiting for them to bring it back before they strt getting 5 stars again. Hint hint"}
{"text":"I never got my fried rice substitute with my teriyaki chicken :-(, but it's a small mistake and they happen. Overall the food was good and hot, so I'll still give them credit for that :-). Plus the staff was friendly and my food came out in an timely manner."}
{"text":"I go in often for lunch and there are 2 women that help me every time. They welcome you the second you open the door. They are always so nice there. Food is always good and I get it in a timely manner. I will continue to come here! Thanks Teriyaki Madness!"}
{"text":"A man cave with Teriyaki bowls.   Seriously, when I got here it was a straight up sausage party, probably because it's all about the meaty portions and the giant flat screens that are only playing ESPN one and two.   I ordered the spicy chicken plate with brown rice, a chicken egg roll, and a house salad. The portions here are massive, I mean when you definitely get what you paid for, but it is a chain restaurant so small prices and big portions are the name of the game.   The chicken was very good and seasoned well with just a hint of spice. It could have been spiced a little more, but I like a da spicy! I only had a few bites of rice, but it was cooked well and the salad was your basic side salad with house dressing, a nice break from the mountains of meat placed in front of me.   The chicken egg roll was a tad overcooked, but I actually enjoy the crunch and slight bitter taste of a slightly burnt egg roll.    It's a chain restaurant yes, this I know, but sometimes you just want to eat and dash with no frills."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually eat here once a week. The food is constantly excellent. I typically go for the Spicy Chicken Teriyaki plate. It comes with a small salad and is more than enough food to get me full. The other menu selections are just as good too. They have beef and pork Teriyaki as well. They also have apps like Crab Rangoon, Gyoza. As all as a few other menu items that I haven't tried yet.   You can get a plate or bowl. The plate comes with the small salad I mentioned earlier and the bowl does not. Both come with white steamed rice standard but you can (for an extra charge) sub fried rice brown rice or noodles.   Be on the look out for buy one get one free coupons. That makes the an even better deal.   All in all it's a great place to eat and well worth the money."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing because it's always good the beef teriyaki is soooo goooood....I don't get any thing else and the spicy chicken ain't that bomb lol but if u put siracha on the beef yummmmmmmmmmmy and I almost forgot the Mac salad is bland or it sucks I get the side salad because the dressing is so addicting xtra dressing pleasseeee! My kids love the side salad because of the dressing and my boys love the orange chicken....everytime we go our bills like $70+ but like they say food is highly addicting"}
{"text":"Horrible food! Do not eat here. So disappointed because service was nice not the food. Spent $23 on food that was not edible. We ordered one plate to share and two appetizers and one drink. Ridiculous prices for greasy shrimp dripping in oil. Burnt rangoons and chicken teriyaki so dry it was like eating sawdust then one side which was a teaspoon of macaroni salad that no joke was the side with the plate! No kidding it came in a sauce cup the kind you get ranch dressing in !!! Should have gone to the place next door! Cafe Rio but we wanted to try something different because Cafe Rio is our \"go to\" and is always perfect!  Lesson learned this place was the WORST!!!! Don't make our mistake go to yummy Cafe Rio take this horrible teriyaki madness off the list."}
{"text":"I came here because I had a Groupon  I ordered the chicken breast plate with white rice, extra meat,a green salad as my side, and medium spicy sauce on the side and my $12 Groupon was just enough to covered it.  My order was to go: There was way too much rice to chicken ratio. Chicken was a little dry, the salad was small and the dressing was sweet. The spicy sauce I had tasted like a sweet sriracha, but not spicy at all.  Even though my order was to go, I was handed my food with no bag/napkins/utensils  Everything tasted alright, nothing to write home about. But I basically had white rice and some grilled chicken breast. I would say it's a little over priced for what I got.  The people were nice, the next time around, I may try the noodles... It's a nice change of pace if you eat at similar chain establishments (but I don't)   11-7-15 I returned the a 2nd time to use my $12 Groupon and ordered the Yakisoba with chicken breast, extra meat, with veggies, and sauce on the side. As you can see from my picture, it was a mess... I didn't not have the quantity of double meat, and the chicken was so dry. Everything was thrown in my box.  I had ordered it to go and there was a handful of people a head of me waiting on food, maybe that was a factor of the way my food came out. I'm sorry, even though it looked like a big heaping portion in my box, it wasn't that good, the noodles tasted under seasoned.  I wanted to like this place, but probably won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this place off and on for the last few years. The only thing that kept me away was the price. It was reasonable if you wanted just dark meat teriyaki chicken & white rice. Everything else was an up charge. Well, it looks like they decided to change that. Now there are many choices included in the price. Which means, I'll be back a lot more. Spicy chicken breast bowl with brown rice & veggies is so yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Teriyaki Madness. I had the chance to try them once before and chose to go with Novecento instead. Depeding on my mood, I can't say I'd do that again. My daughter and I went here on a fluke because we were shopping next door at Big Lots. I am never in the Northwest area, so when I am I try to get something I can't get in my hood. She went with the classic bowl add veggies. I went with the spicy chicken bowl add extra spice and veggies. There is an upgrade option for everything. Brown rice, noddles instead, all white meat, extra meat & more. I like and dislike this factor. The plus side is, no matter what you like from fish to pork to vegitarian- they have an option for you. The downside, there's an upcharge for it. The bowl before veggies is $7, so if your'e like me and want all the goodies- it will probably end up around $10-12 depending on if you went with the plate or bowl and what extras you add.  I also really liked that every table had soy sauce, siracha, and TERIYAKI sauce! Most spots charge when you want extra sauce. Well they stuck witht the name TERIYAKI MADNESS, and gave unlimited sauce for all. YAY! Good service, Clean, I hope there is one by my new house!"}
{"text":"I love this place. A few reviews state that orders were messed up and whatnot but I have never had an issue with this place. They are fast and awesome. I always get the spicy chicken and edemame. The crab rangoon are super yummy too (but I can't eat that right now ). Oh and the salads are awesome too. Not sure when they stopped serving salads with the combo plates tho.  The shop is clean every time I have been in there and they are really polite."}
{"text":"Have to admit there food is amazing, there customer service is no where near that leavel  Hailey is one good example of a supervisor they shouldn't have working there.    Post note they do have a spicy chicken that's amazing.   Try it but maybe try another location"}
{"text":"I have always been satisfied with their food, however, the service was unacceptable during my last visit. I've never had their salad before so I asked the cashier what type of dressing was on it and all he could say was \"Uh, I don't know. It's homemade.\" I asked what flavor it was and again, he said he didn't know so he asked the other cashier next to him and she said the exact same thing, just that it was homemade. The customer next to me had to tell me, but that wasn't that big of a deal. So as I was ordering, the cashier proceeds to blatantly throw the tip jar right in front of me, which was honestly insulting and rude. The guy next to me had change so he threw it in the jar, but neither worker said \"thank you.\" Once I was given my food, I was getting it to go and thank goodness I checked because he forgot my salad. I went back in to ask for it and I know people make mistakes but he never apologized for forgetting food that I paid for and just handed it to me without saying anything. Funny enough, the same exact thing happened to another customer while I was there. This experience was upsetting because the food is great but the staff needs to be friendlier and more attentive. There are several other teriyaki restaurants that have great food AND great service."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  I can't get enough.  Fresh, delicious and nutritious.  They cook your food to order (not like other places).  Very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"We were eager to try this place as it's new, and the menu is right up our alley.  Do not come here if you are trying to grab a quick bite!  Heed the reviews!!! We walked in and there were maybe 3 tables of people in the place. Walked in and ordered.  We were told it would be 10-15 minutes for beef, no problem.  20 minutes later, line is out the door and 1 of the tables that was there before us got their food, the others were done eating.   As they get busier and busier, time keeps going. People that ordered after us are complaining about the wait.  We finally got our door, 33 minutes after ordering. Mediocre at best.  I get this place is fairly new, but we waited for so long.  After our food was brought out, they went and apologized to EVERY OTHER table waiting. Never saying anything about our wait.  We will absolutely never return, and will share our experience with all our friends and family. So disappointed."}
{"text":"I order from this Teriyaki Madness once a week. I always get Uber eats because honestly I'm lazy. The food is amazing and I love having a healthy alternative to other fast foods places. I also have to give a huge shout out to Randy. I already love this place but after today I will forever be a Teriyaki Madness customer. Randy put with his family saw me stranded at work with a flat tire. Already late to pick up my daughter he came over and helped me and by helped I mean he changed my tire because I was doing terrible at it. Randy I can't thank you enough for you kind act. From now on I will be making it a point to come pick up my lunches so I can say hi. Again amazing food amazing people. All around my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Food is good, but pricey......$55 for 4 people!  Staff is hit or miss, there are days we've been & they've been great & other days OY VEY!  Take your chances if you dare!!"}
{"text":"When I first came to Teriyaki Madness, I thought they only sell Teriyaki Chicken but I was wrong. They have many different varieties of food like Orange Chicken, different varieties of noodles, and many more. So far I tried the Spicy Teriyaki Chicken and believe me, it's very spicy and mouthwatering. The teriyaki chicken here is good with their fresh Teriyaki Sauce. I would recommend coming here instead of Panda Express which is across the street. At least the food is made to order, fresh, and delicious."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever. The Cashier Aurora was super nice in helping me pick out what to eat and how to properly pronounce some words. Definitely coming back again and soon. The food was amazingly delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is good, vegetables crisp, chicken cooked very well according to my boyfriends bowl. On the other hand I had the salmon bowl with white rice as vegetables, it was ok.. not the best, but you get a good amount for the price."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst case of customer service I have come across in a long time I ordered my food and waited over 30 min the girl had given away my food admitted it served 6 other people while I waited the other girl came back in and returned my food food grabbed hers then the girl took it in the back and tried to give it to me and pawn it off on me like a fresh bowl she refused to let me speak to a manager. I did nothing wrong then I had to go back to work with no food because you wasted my whole lunch."}
{"text":"Average of 4 visits. Overall, not impressed. Waited 10 minutes on an order of two egg rolls. Walked up to the cashier and asked if my order was done. Was told the eggrolls were frozen. 4 minutes later they handed me the bag with eggrolls in it. On a separate trip we had egg shells in our fried rice. The other times were fine, food was tasty and lots of it. It's a gambling town, so I guess 50/50 is pretty good? :("}
{"text":"Super slow service on the average day but today they 'lost' my order so i had to wait longer. It is also over priced and the food is dry especially the rock hard crab ragoons. Sucks"}
{"text":"Very bland teriyaki sauce for a place that has it in it's name. C'mon, gotta do better than this.   Food got out quick but there weren't many people there to begin with. Vegetables were by far the best thing in my bowl. The brown rice and tofu pretty tasteless and rice had some clumping issues.  Had a TV with the Cavs game on so that was a plus, however, only one TV so kind of awkward with only two people sitting next to each other."}
{"text":"The 1st time we went there for dinner, it was pretty good.  It has quickly gone down hill from that.  If there was an option to give it minus 1 star, I would have done that.  Customer service?  What customer service?  Getting the order right?  Unheard of.  Good food?  NOT.  The last time we gave it another try, I ordered chicken, noodles, light on the teriyaki sauce and lots of vegetables.  What did we get?  Heavy on the teriyaki sauce, very few vegetables and the chicken looked and tasted like it had been sitting there for hours:  actually hard and tough and there was only about 2 tablespoons worth of chicken, I kid you not, I ended up throwing my meal away. My husband got the beef bowl with everything as I did.  OMGosh, the meat was actually black, and those pieces that weren't all fat, were hard as a rock.  What a waste of money.  We now call it Terrible Teriyaki and go past it as fast as we can.  UCK.  Never again."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this area looking for a cheap eat that was not the usual fast food chain. It was a pretty straightforward menu and the lady was so nice accommodating my questions about the chicken spice levels.   Had the two protein plate since I wanted to try both beef and chicken and this meal was good for 2. The beef was tasty but felt dry and it was sliced super thin. Spicy chicken was so juicy and flavorful and hit the right amount of spice and it didn't overpower the teriyaki flavors.   My husband had the chicken teriyaki bowl and I thought it was the perfect size for one person and was a very balanced meal with the stir fried veggies."}
{"text":"Perfect quick take out after along day! Always consistent and fast. Love the chicken teriyaki bowl. Also, I love there take out containers to wash and re-use for my lunches ;)"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was respectfully quick. They have nice patio area at the entrance with table and chairs."}
{"text":"Wow,  WTF... This place makes Panda Express a four star restaurant. Why are the Noodles al dente? I doubt they know what Teriyaki taste like.  Just horrible.  They charge extra for noodles!  They even charge extra for Spicey !  If you are going for Asian fast food just go to Panda,  it's cheaper and taste 1000X better which is me saying a lot because I don't care for Panda Express.  I wish I could give this place no stars.  Yuck"}
{"text":"There has been times that we order to go, and sometimes we stay and eat.  But for a person who loves teriyaki, Teriyaki Madness is the place to be.  I'll be honest, there are some things I like about the place, there are things that I don't like.  But, what matters the most is the quality of the food, which is very fulfilling.    But to give you guys an idea of the place, its located on Craig and Revere, inside the Craig Promenade.  Its in between Big Lots and Party Pro.  Teriyaki Madness has a small restaurant, but big enough to dine in.  A few rows, of tables also tables on the side in the back area.  It also have pictures of famous people, and some of them has been autographed.  What I like about it, is that you have plenty of places to sit at.  What I don't like about it, is when its full, and the only seat that are open, is against the wall and your figuring out, how the hell you're going to get there.  But when you do have a way to getting to your seat its just enough room to enjoy your meal.  They seem to keep it clean majority of the time, but of course when they are busy, it may take them a while to clean a spot for you.    The staff, are very nice, I do like that they are friendly.  I really like the fact, when you call in your order, they sometime remember your order.  Probably cause its in the computer system that tells you, or you probably been ordering from them a lot.  I do like the fact that it doesn't take to long 10-15 minutes is not a long wait.  The quality of the food is great, and the portion is always fullfilling.  There's sometimes when I can't finish it and I save it for later, and it still taste good later.  Overall, highly recommended for the teriyaki lovers out there."}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least 10 times since I've moved to Vegas. They are kinda like the California version of the flame broiler, but  with more choices lol. Food taste fresh and good, service is good, but prices are a little high. I usually order a teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice and I add sautéed  zucchini and it comes to almost 9 dollars. For that price the portion should be larger."}
{"text":"We visited this location for lunch, keep in mind most places of employment only allow one hour for lunch. As we entered this teriyaki madness location we were greeted by the owner Randy, Randy took our order, and assured us it would be just a few minutes, I ordered a spicy chicken bowl with noodles only, which would mean no vegetables. Randy asked if I wanted vegetables I simply said no thank you. We waited patiently for our meal, however, when they brought our meals to us, my girlfriends order was correct, however my lunch was spicy chicken teriyaki bowl with noodles and vegetables. I simply explained to the girl, that was incorrect all I wanted was a spicy teriyaki chicken bowl with noodles only. She grabbed  the bowl off the table never said a word and walk back into the kitchen. We waited for anywhere between 6 to 8 minutes later, and I still had no lunch insight. So I approach the counter once again, and asked Randy for the telephone number to the store because I would like to speak to the manager, at this point I wasn't sure if they were making a new lunch or what? Randy said to me, well what is it that you need with the store manager because I'm the owner? I answered I just want my lunch, he said what what's wrong with your lunch, I replied I ordered a spicy teriyaki chicken bowl with noodles only, he said no you didn't, you ordered vegetables. I said no sir i ordered noodles only no vegetables no meaning none. He turned around and looked at the kitchen and said well didn't they make you a new one they should be making you a new one it's coming right up what is the problem? And I said the problem is by now my girlfriend is halfway done with her lunch by the time I received my lunch it'll be time to go back to work and I won't even get to eat lunch. and he said to me, well it a only be a minute, it should have only taking a minute to make you a new one so what is the problem? I didn't feel like arguing with this guy that it is now been an additional 10 minutes plus since I've been waiting for them to remake a new lunch, keep in mind I've now been waiting 20 plus minutes just for my order. It seemed like Randy could care less about anybody else's time and it was almost a privilege to step through the front door of his restaurant, he was very disrespectful with his attitude and his tone along with his comments. as my order finally came to the window he handed it to me and with this smart tome to his voice said, see. Now have a nice day. As I walked away from the counter I look back to see Randy motioning in my direction laughing with the next customer in line as if it was a giant joke and rolling his eyes at me. I don't think making a joke or talking about a customer behind their back and being disrespectful towards them is very funny. As I left the restaurant it angered me once again because I was not able to eat my entire lunch due to time restraints. I felt somebody else above him should know about his actions his comments, and his disrespect and his attitude towards customers, so I approach the counter one last time, and please keep in mind I just did not want any more conflict with this guy I tried to take the upper road one last time. So I asked the girl behind the counter to make sure his name was Randy, he interrupts the customer that is standing in front of him to look at me and say look buddy what did you want me to do give you a free bowl or something?! I replied to him, No, actually a little less attitude a little respect and a simple apology would have gone a long way. And he said well the girl told me you acted as if you are mad at her, I replied no I simply told her it was the wrong order and I would like the correct order that's all. Keep in mind this is all taking place while he is in the middle of taking an order he actually took the time away from another customer to engage myself?? Then with another smart aleck tone and with the flick of his hand as if to say,get out of my store he says well I apologize! And then asks how's that? And I said, had it been genuine I would probably accept it. He says to me oh well have a nice day! Treating customers like this and acting like Captain Jack Ass, is completely ridiculous. He will treat enough customers like this and eventually he won't be able to make his payment to the teriyaki madness franchise. So I warn you, this guy Randy, number one, definitely feels like it is a privilege for you to walk through the door, number two, your time is definitely not important, it's his time and his time only that means anything. Number 3, if you feel like being disrespected and treated like a moron and being spoke to with an attitude, go there and see Randy."}
{"text":"Our first visit was our last visit to Teriyaki Madness. I had never heard anything about them, but passed by a couple. I figured I've had luck with teriyaki in Vegas, so maybe it's time to try a new place. That was my first mistake.   We arrived, disappointed with the small menu, but continued to look anyways. I thought to myself, \"with those prices, it must be good!\" (Mistake number two).   We ordered a regular sized bowl with orange chicken/noodles and a regular sized bowl with teriyaki chicken/fried rice. Almost $20, fine. The order was repeated back to us, no receipt though.   Then our order comes out, both with brown rice, which neither of us asked for. We have to pay the extra dollar that was not charged in the first place for the noodles I didn't get, fine. We trade in our orders and are told it will be five minutes.   Almost fifteen minutes later, the girl brings out the food asking which bowl had which side because they got it wrong. She had them switch it without asking first.  Ahh, finally time to eat. The chicken tastes that of cheap Chinese food, the vegetables were practically raw, and the noodles tasted like someone microwaved ramen for too long and threw soy sauce all over it.   My advice to anyone asking about this \"restaurant\" would be just to stay home."}
{"text":"Great attitude from the staff.. Very friendly and food was fast and delish. Even tho they had a line they were very efficient on gettting people thru quickly..."}
{"text":"Waited almost 20 minutes for my food (reading the signs in the restaurant) I figured my food was being \"made to order\" I finally got my order potstickers weren't remotely warm (deep fried?) brown rice was cold and hard and the chicken was FAR from \"made to order\" and was also not even remotely warm.  I'm the only one sitting in this place...very disappointing for a $10.50 order. Would definitely NOT recommend this dump"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I come here every once in a while. I have a friend that works here. Cool spot.   Good place to come after a workout at EOS fitness. Close by and affordable."}
{"text":"D- Chicken breast was dry and inedible. Added an extra star as the orange chicken was ok.  Never had a problem with the Craig location before. Won't return to this one"}
{"text":"Food was cold yesterday. Came back today to give it another shot... same thing.  Sauce is tasty and chicken has a little char which I like, but it's just poorly run. Bummer!"}
{"text":"This place is great place to get quick healthy food. The employees are super nice. I used my birthday coupon and my 20% girl didn't even ask too many questions. She honored it no questions asked. Veggies are fresh and chicken is healthy. Brown rice is fresh as we'll. I recommend this to all my friends. And sign up for notifications (they are worth it :))"}
{"text":"My egg roll was free and probably the best thing I had. I got the teriyaki chicken bowl with white rice and didn't really enjoy my chicken. It taste a little rubber-like. It may be just the chicken but if I go back I will get another protein. The teriyaki sauce alone was good! They have some sitting on the tables and I like extra sauce so this was a plus! Overall pleasant experience I just wouldn't recommend the chicken.   Nice clean atmosphere. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is the newest T-Mad location and as you can see from my review history I am an avid teriyaki connoisseur and have quite the keen eye for quality service and let me tell you this new location is the Apex of both. My bowl of choice is the spicy teriyaki bowl with brown rice and vegetables. When my food came out the chicken was carmalized and perfectly season, the rice was moist and fresh, and the vegetables were a perfect combination of my daily greens. 10 of 10 would recommend. As a side note I would like to give a special shoutout to the cashier whose name I believe is Dillon for great service and an award winning smile you a real one D."}
{"text":"I am an avid gym goer and there is nothing I like more than getting in a good pump and then rewarding myself with T-Mad. The food is always consistent, fast and fills all my macro needs."}
{"text":"The customer service here was by far the worst out off the teriyaki Madness I have been to here in Las Vegas. Do not work with people if you can't offer a friendly service, the food was good so no problems with the cooks four stars for you guys."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place by accident after a delayed flight caused me to cut my lunch date short.  Conveniently situated next door to Starbucks, where my colleagues were in meetings, it seemed the obvious second choice while I waited.  I ordered beef teriyaki with white rice and vegetables.  The meal had a solid flavor and fresh vegetables.  I can't complain about a filling lunch in the $8 range, and on top of that, the employees are very friendly.  There was a distinct cleaning solution smell that I noticed when I first walked in--it was a little off-putting, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars.  Fortunately, I stopped noticing the smell after sitting for a few minutes.  I might not go out of my way to return, but if I'm in the area, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot. Love the fact that they are not stingy on the teriyaki sauce. They put the bottle on the table so you can enjoy it. Smart!!! Without the sauce the dish won't taste the same. Smart management."}
{"text":"I came into this spot pretty late and their food is still super fresh. I love the way they assist the customers. They also have a great sense of humor. I am actually impressed with how fast they made the food cooked from scratch!!!! If your ever near w Craig rd you must stop and try it ... Tell them Glowing Star Media sent you for specials"}
{"text":"The food was hot, fresh and filling! I got the fried rice and spicy chicken bowl. I love that they grill up the chicken. I will definitely go back. The girl up front was super friendly and made sure I was happy with my food."}
{"text":"chicken teriyaki plate - good flavor and not dry at all. i was hoping it would be all chopped up in small chunks like one of the pictures on here shows, but it was only chopped into strips. still good even though i had to cut it up for my daughter. she will not eat meat unless it cut up very small. she and i ate 1.5 of the 2 scoops of rice. from the looks of it, they cut back portions on rice and chicken about 80%. i prefer more rice.   beef yakisoba - very good flavoring on the noodles. i didnt care for the meat so much. the vegetables were good, just not the lettuce. i hate soggy lettuce.   my two year old loved both plates. she ate a lot and that makes me very happy."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money $10 plus for a plate supper dry dry dry brunt burnt really nasty save your money go somewhere else.service was good"}
{"text":"This is our go-to quick dinner place. The Spicy Chicken Protein Bowl is delicious. They use carrot, zucchini, broccoli, onion and cabbage. The chicken is well marinated and cooked perfectly. The young lady that's always working is friendly. I highly recommend eating at this location."}
{"text":"So I been there twice already and both times the has been good, customer service was good. I walked away very happy and satisfied. They cook the food pretty quick as well, which was a surprise seeing how they packed."}
{"text":"Def a go too for fast food my husband and I are not too fond of fast food so we have our select go to places and this is def one of them! It is a little on the pricier side for fast food we usually have a bogo and still spend like $16"}
{"text":"Teriyaki madness is a great place to stop for a bite before a nice 5 hour drive back to cali.  I just got the chicken Katsu bowl and thank the food gods that the Katsu was not over cooked like a lot of places seem to do. The meat in the center was perfect. Steamed vegetables were...... Steamed O.o not sure how else I can describe that lol but over all the food was good and every vegas trip we stop by for a quick bite on the way back."}
{"text":"I have only been here 2x but the food is quick and delicious! I love the chicken teriyaki bowl and the chicken noodles. I ate the whole dish within a day to myself! Tonight I am trying the beef noodles, the edamame and the egg roll. Everything tastes fresh and well seasoned. I will be a regular here I can already tell. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious as usual.  Got my two protein plate with spicy chicken and teriyaki beef with a side of mac salad, but to my surprise they have new plate/bowls. Which i must say I'm not sure i enjoyed to much.  My husband who is usually over satisfied requested a portion of my rice because he didn't have enough for his own?  Made me wonder.  Other than that food was fresh as usual only deducted 1 star bc the lady at the counter sworn my liquid gold teriyaki sauce was in the bag and was not as promised and for the suspicious lack of rice.. goodnight folks."}
{"text":"A little pricy but the food and portion size is well worth it. I would eat there everyday if I could."}
{"text":"For fast food Japanese I got to admit I am impressed.  The beef teriyaki is so tender and delicious.  Their terra yaks is is thick and sweet.  I love their teriyaki sauce as it is some of the best I ever had.      My wife loves their yakisoba which is freshly made with lots of veggies.  The brown rice is perfect with the beef teriyaki.  The Macaroni salad is quite tasty but since it is my daughter favorite I rarely get any.  We have gotten the Gyoza, Shrimp Tempura and fried wontons and they are all very good.      Their prices are quite reasonable and they text deals at least bi/weekly.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.   The inside is simple but always clean and inviting.  We get their food at least twice a month at a minimum.  They are great for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"First time here. Got to say the service was great. As for the food, it was a-ok!  I was impressed with how quick the food came out especially since there was quite a few people there. I ordered the pork teriyaki and chicken katsu. A good sized portion. The mac salad was great! There was something about it that I can't quite figure out. I was expecting some type of mac salad that you would get at a hawaiian bbq place.  Anyways, a good go to place for lunch. :o)"}
{"text":"Just okay  Have had better teriyaki even at other fast food places.  Food was slow to come out and there was only.one person ahead of me when I walked in. Would ahte to see the wait if the place was crowded.  Also- not crowded at lunch time on a weekday. Should have tipped me off. The place is basically empty and this should be the rush time.   Overall- I'm full, but I won't be back. Would rather go to the mall food court across the street"}
{"text":"This business is all about making you, the customer happy. They also are very consistent in the food they provide with very good ticket times. The establishment is always clean, the owners are always involved with their customers, and their employees always seem to be happy to work there. One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas for a great affordable lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is...poor at best. I had to wait over 25 minutes for my yakisoba noodles while I saw people who placed their orders much later than mine come pick up their food right in front of me...."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place even though the service is kind of slow.  The yakisoba noodle plate is huge and easy to share with two people.  I also am a big fan of the spicy teriyaki."}
{"text":"Can't say anything bad about this place.  Staff is great, food is great, great location by the gym and my house.  Spicy chicken or teriyaki beef are my go to entrees.   I usually take mine home and throw an over easy egg on top if the bowl.  yum!"}
{"text":"Not all that great for the cost. Too much rice and like one chicken breast for almost $10.00. A little pricey when you can go to the all tou can eats down the road for the same price. Sauce taste like out of a can. Not too much flavor in the chicken either. Kinda dry."}
{"text":"Spicy Chicken Bowl easy on the brown rice, heavy on the veggies has been a favorite for years. First time trying this location and the food holds up. Discount for Lyft/Uber.   Only complaint is that Staff could do a better job at listening though...I shouldn't have to repeat myself so many times speaking in clear English."}
{"text":"The chicken teriyaki is amazing at this location, I usually go to another location but I was in the area and stopped in on Monday afternoon and the food and service are so much better than the one I usually go to. Definitely worth driving a few more minutes for. I love how fresh tasting the food is."}
{"text":"Food here is ok, egg rolls are really good.    Service was excellent.   If you like Hawaiian style teriyaki, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by because I wanted something other than fried chicken and a burger. Why I was sitting there trying to decide what I want the girl at the register went to the back to get me a sample of the Teri steak so I can see if I like it or not. It was delicious and I ended up getting a bowl of it with brown rice. The best decision I made there and I can't wait to go back and try other items. I got the kids portion and it was the perfect size for me. The beef was tender and flavorable and not too teriyaki if you know what I mean.   5 stars for the food and 5 stars for the awesome customer service"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like this place. It was full of people and seemed clean inside. We took our order to go and it did not smell too good in the car. But I figured veggies stink. After eating a few bites I realized it was not edible!!! It tasted rotten.  Not sure what it was the steak the veggies but something is off. Boo!! for living this far out I really wanted this to be good. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I love this place when we dont feel like cooking or eating out at a restraunt. Its quick easy and really tasty. The price is right, the portions are great, and it still tastes delicious on day two! Personally I love the spicy beef and my only complaint is that I always think it could use a little more sauce."}
{"text":"My first time here and the food is fresh, fast and good!!! The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and this chicken bowl I amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great help and food, but CLEAN YOUR TABLES and restaurants. Stay on top of no swaying furniture and what seems to be dirty towels when wiping the tables. Streaks of dirtiness."}
{"text":"I always order the Teriyaki chicken bowl. I'm a regular customer here and this time I feel like there portions got smaller. Chicken was kinda burnt.   Overall, will come again. Staff was friendly and area is clean"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this location for 6 years now and have noticed a decrease in the quality of food over the past 2 years. The last 2 times I have order from here my chicken breast has been ultra chewy and inedible. Not to mention the fact that they now charge you for a green salad with any plate purchase only to be served wilted lettuce. I'm not sure what's happening here but I'm to the point of never wanting to give them another chance."}
{"text":"We tried giving this place a second chance after being terribly disappointed by the extremely long wait for our food the first time. Unfortunately it was the same situation again today. The food is good, but they run out of meats and you're forced to eat something you didn't come here to eat. I did not rate this place a 1 only because the food is actually good, and the staff although is very nice seem a little lost. Not sure why it should take so long for fast food. If you order take out, I suggest you check your order before leaving the restaurant, or you may find out your order is wrong when you get home."}
{"text":"Food is really good but takes a little bit of time for it to come out. I had the spicy chicken bowl with rice and veggies. Good but still want it more spicy!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that we've gone here for years and have always loved it. This is one place that I can still eat despite health issues and allergies. But apparently it is going downhill.   We go often enough that we have a standing order. We simply give them our telephone number and the order we want comes up and that is it. We do this about once a month.   Today we walk in and I give the kid our phone number and the order total is close to $80. Our order is usually closer to $35. He double checks my phone number and then reads off the order. It is an order from like two years ago when we had friends staying with us. I'm asking how that is possible when we use that phone number to order all the time. He couldn't explain it and said he had to start from scratch. Weird. But not a big deal.   Then I stressed to him NO SAUCE on the chicken breast bowl. I CANNOT have it. I asked him twice to make sure the order said \"no sauce\".  Got home and the order has sauce. And of course the chicken and rice is drenched so there is no way I can eat it. It will make me sick.   Then my husband said his order was different. He said it doesn't taste like it normally does. He was surprised. As I said, we eat here, on average, about once a month. Also, the Katsu chicken for my son came with NO katsu sauce. ???? Did they omit the katsu sauce rather than the breast bowl sauce? I don't see how they could have made that mistake because I stressed that there was to be no sauce on the breast bowl.   Anyway--extremely disappointed in this experience."}
{"text":"They warn their food is highly addictive and they're not joking!  I usually get the Teriyaki Chicken / Spicy Chicken Plate with steamed white rice and macaroni salad.  I've been eating here for the past 2 years and I've never had a single time when I was disappointed with their food."}
{"text":"Came in looked the menu over for an \"In-between Church Services Meal\". No idea what I wanted. The beautiful cashier suggested the Spicy Chicken Bowl they were known for. After several questions like...\"is it spiced with Siracha or not\", she got me a sample. The sauce was FIRE in a good way!!! She said the meal would enhance its flavor. After ordering and picking a size and everything, I realized I literally had 3 servings of Chicken Teriyaki with brown rice at home and told her it didn't make since to pay $10 for the same thing I had at home. I apologized and asked her to cancel the order.  She did so with a smile, said no worries and was very kind. 4 stars for EXCELLENT customer service. Hoping to add the 5th star when I finally try the food one day."}
{"text":"So good!   After forgetting about this place several times, I finally remembered it at lunch time today.  I had the Chicken Breast Teriyaki Bowl which I got white rice and mixed stir fry veggies with it.  The chicken was awesome and filled with teriyaki flavor.  The rice was good and there was plenty for a lunch portion.  Wasn't the biggest fan of the stir fry veggies, and will probably just do without next time.  But, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The place is very clean, the service is good and fast and it is definitely I place I plan to go often!"}
{"text":"Like all the other teriyaki madness locations in town...amazing!! This place takes it one step further with phone number remembrance that will ask if you'd like the same order, very convenient!  Love the spicy chicken bowl!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of the spicy chicken bowl!   Fantastic food and service, good price point, semi-healthy, all around great spot! Enjoy getting quantity two, one for the time being and one for later!!!"}
{"text":"I'm here at least once a week. Always good. I've tried half of the menu and working on the other half"}
{"text":"I must say that I thought it was strange that this chain opened in this particular location, as there is a Samurai Sam's and a Panda Express located a mere five minute walk away, but I thought I'd try it anyway.  Plainly said, it SUCKED.  I ordered the Spicy Chicken Plate with no vegetables, and WOW, I have not tasted such garbage in a long time. I know that it doesn't necessarily take much to make chicken spicy, but they could have been more creative than just pouring syriachi sauce on the meat and stir-frying it. It tasted like that was the ONLY seasoning on the meat.   I have to also mention that the white rice was crunchy, and the macaroni salad was so runny it reminded me more of potato salad. Just nasty.  For quick Asian eats, check out the aforementioned Panda Express, because even the Samurai Sam's has gone down hill in this area."}
{"text":"I have been to this TM multiple times and each time was good. I always order over the phone so I can pick up and go. Yesterday was such a disappointment. I ordered my regular spicy breast bowl with veggies on the side and when I got home I realized they gave me the wrong order. I think, no big deal I'll call and see what can be done. I tell the woman what happened and she says \"I don't know, I punched in your order correctly.\" Okay, the issue is not what you punched in but that the food I got was wrong. She repeats that she punched in the spicy breast bowl. At this point I'm frustrated bc why would I call if I had the right food order. What I have in front of me is a teriyaki breast bowl and I DO NOT care for it.   I tell her, I'm not arguing about her punching the wrong buttons, I don't have what I ordered. She says in order for her to do anything she has to see the food. Why would I lie? I had no time last time to do that because I've been caring for a sick friend.   Now I have a plate of food on my fridge in order to even get my money back whenever I go back? That's super messed up. Now I'll have to drive home after my hospital visit then back to TM to get my money back. This will be my last visit to that location. Holding my money hostage for some food I don't even like. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Fresh, hot food cooked to order by nice people at good prices. Excellent portion sizes. Try the spicy chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu."}
{"text":"Really Tasty Yakisoba especially when Orange Chicken with veges and fried rice also an entree"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  My kids and my wife and I loved all we had.  Teriyaki chicken., beef teriyaki, orange Chicken. They were all good.  Local favorite it seems.  Was busy the whole time we ate in.  But the service was fast and friendly.  I had beef bowl with veggies. The gyoza was awesome too."}
{"text":"This is not necessarily the cheapest or best tasting teriyaki spot around, but it's not a bad option if you are nearby or in a rush. They offer a discount for anyone that is a member of 24 hour fitness so be sure that you mention that to them.   The staff members are very nice and the food comes out in a timely manner. I wouldn't mind coming back again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, outstanding service. Love the place as a whole. Worth the money"}
{"text":"Great tasting food but slow service at times, I waited 20 minutes for a chicken beast bowl but watched 3 people's orders who came in after me come out, watched them complete their meals and leave and I'm still waiting for mine to come out. As I type this review I'm still waiting for my food and nobody has said anything to me about why it's taking so long."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive but you do get a lot of food. I suggest sharing and if you need more purchase it. The staff was friendly and it was clean!"}
{"text":"My husband has been eating at Teriyaki Madness about 3 times a week for nearly 10 years. We'd go to the Blue Diamond and Decatur location or the Durango and 215 location. The owner Randy was always such a pleasure to talk to. We moved back to Seattle so we miss this place a ton! If you read this Randy Luke and his brother Brett say Hi!   :)"}
{"text":"WARNING!!!  Be ready to be addicted to Teriyaki Madness!!  Great customer service and you can't beat their food!"}
{"text":"I have been to chain restaurants and I would think they would change the menu back, I mean the way I use to it.  The meat was cut thick not bit size with extra sauce not dry, this place went downhill. AVOID"}
{"text":"I love Teriyaki Madness and was so excited when this location opened up close to my home!  Debbie (the owner) came over and introduced herself to us and was so friendly and welcoming!  Food was great as usual and can't wait to visit more often!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I've been here plenty of times since the first one opened in Vegas. I really enjoy the Yakisoba. I usually get a chicken Yakisoba with a side of spicy chicken. Really good food for a fair price."}
{"text":"The food is ok.. High in price for just a rice bowl..  I would have liked more meat.."}
{"text":"Love teriyaki madness however I hate how they don't give you appropriate portions when you order just veggies instead of rice. If they are going to give you half the food they should charge you half the price. Better off ordering a kids meal."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant with great teriyaki and egg rolls.  The spicy teriyaki had too much of an overwhelming Sriracha sauce taste for my preference, but otherwise all of the food we ordered was excellent.  The atmosphere was nothing special, but the tables and floor were very clean and the drink station well stocked and organized.  I'll certainly come back."}
{"text":"Do you guys do refunds? Really not a fan of the chicken or the fried rice and especially not the price point for the combo. It tastes microwaved, soggy and lacks flavor. This is being thrown away after two bites.  I would say that I Panda Express has a better bowl for three dollars less. Bummed that this was the new place that I decided to try tonight."}
{"text":"This is an easy place to come visit if you want easy food that is decently healthy, depending on your order of course.  The selection isn't too vast where you get confused looking at the menu, but it has enough items where you can make yourself a decent combination of items. They have a bowl or plate option, depending on your level of hunger. Along with their variety of meats to choose from, they have white rice, brown rice, noodles, and vegetables. I'm personally a brown rice guy with either the teriyaki beef and/or chicken with vegetables, which I believe to be the best combination for my health, taste buds, and tummy. The staff was helpful and I would recommend coming to his location if you're in the area and want a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"We were craving teriyaki rice bowls and found this place on Yelp. Based on first impressions the place had potential as menu was extensive and somewhat impressive. We tried the beef teriyaki, combo of chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki. Flavor was ok but the food (and the rice) was dry. Were we supposed to compensate by adding their house teriyaki sauce available on each table? We got the shrimp tempura for my 2 year old and it was good. During our time there we noted the place is also popular for take outs, a lot came in just to pick up their orders."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! The best teriyaki I've had since I moved from CA 6 years ago. The place could have been a bit cleaner (lunch rush). But I'm a thumbs up on Teriyaki Madness. Now, can we get one in Phoenix?"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years!  We have been getting text specials for years also.  Today was the 1st time they did not honor their specials!  Per manager Jose, he did not know about the special so he won't honor it!  I said we have never had a problem before, when I asked him which store Is offering the special he said he doesn't know, so i am supposed to drive to every teriyaki madness to find out who texted me!  This is the only teriyaki madness we go to and they have the \"Text for specials\" sign up!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and Karen provided excellent and quick customer service. One of my family's favorites!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Girl at front counter (with red hair) hated her job. I was waiting 40 mins for an order. She was very rude. She didn't even check to see if it was done when I came in, and it was. Kevin had to help me and personally apologized."}
{"text":"There chicken is awesome but I decided to try teriyaki beef instead and I'm in love! Must try!"}
{"text":"I was staying close to this place and stopped in because they had pretty good reviews. Great service. The two young ladies behind the counter were very nice and welcoming. Although they took my name they still brought the food to my table. The customers were pleasant too. Struck up a conversation with a local that ate there from time to time. Place was clean and neat. The decore was fitting and I thought it was good value for what I got.   I got he spicy chicken bowl with veggies and I would get it again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more but, well, here we are. I decided to pick up a chicken teriyaki bowl for a weeknight dinner since I was in the shopping center running another errand.  I placed my order to-go and then proceeded to w a i t. I realize that the food is made-to-order but goodness, it was at least a 15 minute wait that I was unprepared for. Full disclosure, I was hungry, moreso HANGRY so the wait just made me more annoyed.   Word to the wise: order your food before you show up.  The menu is bright, big, and very easy to understand. So even if you didn't have time to look at the menu beforehand, you'll be able to quickly make a decision. As I mentioned at the beginning, I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl with vegetables and fried rice (fried rice is + $1) which brought my total to $10 and change, without a beverage.   The bowl portion was/is HUGE. I got three different servings out of that one bowl so it was money well spent. I was not impressed with the fried rice but I'm verrrry picky about fried rice. I would not order it again. I also found the teriyaki sauce okay but it could've been better.   Should I go a next time, I will take heed of my fellow yelpers and order a kids' portion and try a different menu item but I will make sure to check in so I get the yelp 15% discount!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place, despite not being a huge fan of teriyaki. The cashier was very friendly and informative. He ended up asking me if this was my first time here. When I told him it was, he gave me a free soda!  As I was finishing my meal, he was cleaning up the lobby and asked me how it was. I told him it was good. We discussed the food for a bit and he told me how he enjoyed the spicy dish as well and it's one of the reasons he opened this restaurant. You gotta love an owner that is willing to put on the same uniform and do the same work as his employees. Kudos to him.  Oh...and the food was good too."}
{"text":"Food is awesome.. have come here many times over 5 years.  Customer service is absolutely horrific.  Came here today and it took 25 minutes for my food to be prepared. People who came in 15 minutes after me got their food before me. Requested a refund and didn't bother eating after this. There was a group of guys who ordered right ahead of us who were finished with their meal when our food finally was ready  It is not so much about what happened, but in the face of all this the blonde girl at the cashier copped an attitude with me like i was somehow a nuisance. Not one apology. Not one \"I am so sorry, have it on us today\", not even an offer of a partial refund. Nothing. The only thing i got from her was \"well, beef takes 5-6 mins to cook\"... uh hello it was almost a half hour!! UNREAL  I hope this place fails. The owner is an idiot for hiring such useless and worthless employees"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's a little slow, but the last time I went did it for me. I will not return to this location anymore. It was around 7:30pm and was pretty empty inside, maybe four customers total. There was no line at the counter so you would think I would be taken care of pretty fast. The cashier and other employees were behind the small door that separates the kitchen from the counter. The cashier clearly saw me standing there and continued her conversation with the rest of the employees. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to order. All of the employees had seen me and completely ignored the fact that I standing there waiting to order. Truly it is not hard to take an order and then continue your conversation. I realized the food was not worth the wait since it's not that good to begin with. Overall it was just rude to ignore the that somewhere was there waiting for them to finish their conversation.... therefore I left since no one ever came to the cash register to help me"}
{"text":"So far so good. I had the regular size spicy chicken teriyaki bowl with noodles.  Definitely had a kick to them but it was good. My wife got a regular salmon with noodles. With two bottled drinks total was about $24. The bowls also come with veggies cabbage, onions, broccoli and I think carrots. I'll be coming back soon"}
{"text":"Had to grab lunch before work so I stopped into this place. The girls upfront are very polite and attentive. I was in a hurry (not that they knew or was their fault I was late) so I ordered my food, added some edamame and it was ready in no time. The food here is very good! Also I noticed it very clean. It was about and hour and a half before closing and the place was very well put together."}
{"text":"Came in for my lunch hour from work to order a spicy chicken bowl with brown rice and vegetables and an iced tea to go.  The girl at the counter was friendly and my order came out quick!  Overall happy with service and food was excellent, ate half but couldn't finish and saved rest for next day and it was still good."}
{"text":"As I walked in, there is a very strong smell of grilling meat. Its a bit much.The gals are friendly at the ordering counter.Both times I have dined here, my order was correct, hot, and I didnt have to wait long.  I like that there is Teriyaki sauce bottle son each table, however it tastes different that the sauce that is initially put on your meal.  The teriyaki sauce is quite sweet.  For being such a new restaurant its not very clean.  When ordering the floor behind the staff near the swing doors was black and unclean.  Many tables in the dining room had not been cleaned off before another person sat down and the woman's bathroom was disgusting. I was there at lunchtime and the floor needed to be swept as there was black stuff along the entire border of the bathroom. It really grossed me out. My mom always said that the bathrooms are a reflection of how clean the kitchen is. Scared to know in this case."}
{"text":"Awesome sauce! This place has great food and amazing service...me and my sister loves this place.  She's there more than me but none the less great food."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of teriyaki and being mad, so I thought that Teriyaki Madness would float my boat more than it did. I have been here four times since they have opened at this location and I am genuinely not impressed. Why have I been back three times since the initial visit, you wonder? GOOD COUPONS.   I haven't cared to read what other people think regarding Teriyaki Madness' prices. But you can take it from me that this place is NOT cheap. It seems like everything is an additional dollar to add on from making the rice white to brown, the chicken from white to brown, or simply adding vegetables. When I am already paying 8 - 9 bucks for one tray of food, can you blame me for being hesitant to add anything to my already expensive meal??  I can complain about the prices all I want, but the fact is : the food itself is mediocre. The chicken katsu is often dry and the teriyaki sauce tastes like many BOTTLED teriyaki sauces (someone else said that their teriyaki tasted like Yoshida's and I CANNOT agree more!!). You can easily leave Teriyaki Madness paying 11 bucks for a single meal and still be somewhat hungry after the plate is empty. Did I mention that the macaroni salad has NO flavor whatsoever??!! I didn't think that anything with mayonnaise could be soooooo bland!  The service is just like the food : mediocre. What more can I say? Every single face that works inside Teriyaki Madness says : \"I cannot wait to get off of work\". Maybe that is normal, maybe it is a problem. You decide.  Now that my coupons are expired (or used), I've got to be honest : I have little reason to ever go to Teriyaki Madness again. There is absolutely NOTHING that would entice me to come back to Teriyaki Madness.... even if it IS down the street from my living quarters.   Teriyaki Madness ..... \"Doing teriyaki a disservice since 2003\""}
{"text":"This was not a good experience. The pasta was extremely dry and the beef was cooked in so much salt. This was before you added the teriyaki sauce yourself. I won't be coming back for what this place is worth."}
{"text":"I seriously don't know why I've never tried this place before. I always heard it was good, so I finally decided to give it a try, and I loved it. I got a plate with half spicy and half katsu and it came with white rice and stir fry veggies. The spicy chicken was delicious. I couldn't finish my plate because there was so much food! The veggies were pretty good too, I hadn't expected them to taste good. I think next time I will get the bowl. Since I ended up leaving a bunch of rice and veggies. It was a little pricey, but you get a lot of food, so it's worth it. And the service was good too. I will definitely be eating here more often."}
{"text":"Mmmm! My kind of fast food. This is an awesome place for takeout or a quick meal. It never fails I always get the same thing. The Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice and I add grilled veggies for $1. Sometimes when I'm feeling a little naughty Ill get a veggie egg roll too. The Teriyaki sauce is amazing, and they put it on light unlike most places that will drown your rice in it. This is an awesome healthier alternative to a typical fast food restaurant. You can always call in an order to be picked up in roughly 15 minutes. The service is always pleasant and my order has always been correct. I def suggest this place!"}
{"text":"Not the best beef teriyaki bowl I've ever had and it took over 20 minutes to get to me in a restaurant that was about 25% full of customers. I went with the standard beef teriyaki bowl with brown rice and veggies and we decided to grab the Shrimp Tempura appetizer for starters. The bowl itself was nothing out of the ordinary, the beef was decent, veggies were okay, and it seemed the highlight of the meal was there teriyaki sauce which was quite good. The Shrimp Tempura app wasn't bad, came with four pieces and had it's own dipping sauce. Overall my experience could only be summed up as mediocre with a long wait to start it all off. If I had known it was going to take so long I would have walked across the parking lot to Taco Bell for my appetizer."}
{"text":"Stopped here after working out and needed a quick, healthy small meal before heading somewhere else.  I ordered spicy chicken with brown rice and vegetables.  Very tasty, lots of flavor and cooked perfectly.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have visited this store multiple times and have never been disappointed. I usually get lucky enough to have Cira as my server, who is absolutely delightful. She always greets me with a smile and makes me feel like she really cares that I have the best experience possible. Tonight I also had the pleasure of meeting another employee, Briana, who was equally helpful. The food here is amazing, I have visited another location, but the food and staff do not compare to this location. I am an ex restaurant manager, so I feel it is important to give thanks where they are do. To the manager, I thank you for obviously caring about your employees and customers; your employees would not be so incredibly awesome if you didn't care."}
{"text":"Something is always wrong with this place every time I come, if it's not one thing it's another, one day it was they ran out of beef another day out of chicken, came in today and they're closed when it shows they're open at 10 am, it's very frustrating, food is great the people running this particular venue are a joke."}
{"text":"I give this location a 5 star review,  hands down I have been coming here since it opened 11 yrs ago nothing but great food and out standing customer service. I want to give a shout out to Jose and Byron for excellent service."}
{"text":"Really delicious fast food at decent prices. Also, I don't feel as guilt eating here as I do going to a drive thru. :P Their teriyaki sauce is the best!   The staff are always really nice, as well. (:"}
{"text":"Great staff, attention to detail. Ordered $85 of food and needed it a certain way. Staff exceeded my expectations based on other Teriyaki Madness locations. Average wait for a large order. As always great food, just wished that they delivery available."}
{"text":"After previous issues/concerns, Randy made it right. Randy is a very passionate owner that took issues and concerns of the past and was proactive in retaining a customer. He personally called and we had a discussion on how to better his business. Randy has earned my respect as well as my continued patronage to his fine establishment. As always, great food! Definitely will be back! Thanks!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat and the food is always consistent. I've been coming to this location for years and the employees all know me by name. If you haven't tried it yet order the spicy chicken bowl or plate.   The chicken is always well prepared and cooked to a perfect texture. The rice is usually consistent along with crisp fresh vegetables. If you're looking for a meal that'll fill you up, but not kill your calorie intake this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Love this place. Spicy chicken teriyaki plate is the best! Quality chicken, rice and great spice/sauce. My dad always orders a side gyoza's which are also really tasty. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I like this place . Clean.  Fast and friendly service. The food is good and the prices are fair for what you get. I was there before the lunch rush, so I can't speak for how the staff works under pressure, but I'll definitely come back here. 3 stars for some tasty teriyaki, and fast friendly service."}
{"text":"I own multiple businesses and their employee Chelsea working in the front is by far one of the best workers I have ever seen. If she was my employee I would hold onto her for dear life. Super friendly, super helpful, remembered my name when I left. People like her make a business successful."}
{"text":"This food is delicious. I got the teriyaki which they have an option of dark or white meat.. I asked for both and the gladly placed my order. Definitely going back soon.. Yum"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the way they do things at Teriyaki madness. It's really nothing special, especially if you've ever visited a franchise known as The Flame Broiler back in California. But what these guys do, they do quite well.  I usually get their chicken rice bowl with brown rice and extra hot sauce on the side. I suppose I could order their spicy bowl, but I don't see the point of paying extra for it when I can get the same sauce they presumably use to marinate their meat for free right next to the drink fountain. And the combination of their salty teriyaki glaze with the spicy tang of sriracha is just too addicting to pass up.  You can get their chicken veggie bowl if you want to moderate the meat consumption a little bit...but I can't bring myself to do that.   It's not the cheapest place to go for a quick bite at over 7 dollars a bowl, but you do get what you pay for. The portions are impressive and I guarantee you will be full if you can finish the whole thing. It's a popular choice among weightlifters or other fitness savvy folk and I think it's no mistake that these stores tend to be located next to gyms. It doesn't look particularly impressive inside but I highly suggest you order some carryout from this place and eat in a location catered to your comfort so that you can fully appreciate how good this grub can be."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It has the best teriyaki in all of las Vegas!  For lunch or a healthy meal after the gym this IST spot.  I like the breast and brown rice for something healthy or the spicy chicken.  The staff is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Like many of our restaurant experiences, this begins with, \"I had a coupon . . .\"  This small place is located near the Superstition Springs mall and across the street from Pier One Imports.  We were there at lunchtime and it was packed, which is always a good sign.  (Or maybe everyone else had a coupon, too.)  I ordered the chicken breast teriyaki with double veggies, no rice.  My husband got the regular chicken bowl meal.  It wasn't worth it for me to pay extra for the chicken breast as the meat on his lunch was every bit as tender.  Hubby felt the food was pricey, but then he saw the size of the portions.  Pretty big!  However, a lot of rice.  His came with veggies on the side.  Usually veggies are a mix of the three usual suspects, but this mix had more variety.   You can have white, brown, fried rice as the base or yakisoba noodles or vegetables. Teriyaki Madness also has a tofu dish and a kids' menu.  There are the expected appetizers.  I got a nicely salted edamame.    We liked it enough that I took an orange chicken bowl home for our son.  He said it was some of the best orange chicken he's had -- and he's had that dish at many, many restaurants.   I wish there were a 3.5 rating.  The food was very tasty, but the price was a bit high and I'd like to see more variety on the menu."}
{"text":"I happened to be waiting for a friend to join me at Starbucks at Sahara and Rainbow. While I was waiting, someone came out of the neighboring business and tried to entice me to come in and we both agreed.  Apparently, this store just opened 10/252016 so they were passing out menus and coupons to drum up business. We both ordered the Chicken Teriyaki plate which came with your choice of two sides, I chose white rice and vegetables. My companion had white rice and macaroni salad and a side of noodles.  The food was GREAT! I give it 5 stars! However, the pricing $22.68 was not worth what we got. Will I return? More than likely not. Just to pricey for me for what you get.  The staff were all very nice and the interior and exterior were nicely done. The place was very clean. Restrooms too!  Overall, this was a good experience, but because of price I can only give it 3 stars. Thanks!"}
{"text":"As I was scrolling down the other reviews I was surprised at the high ratings. My sister and I stumbled upon this place by chance, we were actually going to the Hawaiian Poke place a few doors down, but we didn't realize it was just a takeout deli so we walked around and found Teriyaki Madness.   We tried two things off of the menu: chicken teriyaki bowl and the beef teriyaki bowl. The chicken bowl gets 4 1/2 stars. Its got a nice flavor, the chicken is tender, and the vegetables go really well with it. The beef teriyaki is terrible. The meat was very tough, rubbery, and unpleasant. Haven't been back since to review anything else, so if you go get the chicken bowl if you're indecisive about chicken or beef."}
{"text":"I just ordered the chicken/beef combo after my gym workout. I waited fiteen good minutes until I went to the counter to say \"I'm about to faint\" The girl walked into the kitchen to find my meal just sitting on the counter. I even tipped her a dollar! Which I thought about asking for her to return! She didn't apologize and only said \"Thank You\" after I stood in the doorway to leave for 5 seconds. I appreciate happy customer service skills...and If I tip, I expect efficient service.  Besides this, the beef tasted like beef jerky...good flavor but WAYYYYY over-cooked"}
{"text":"First off I appreciate that teriyaki madness has multiple locations. I also appreciate that there isn't any variance in the food. Every location I've stopped at has been the same when it comes to the food. This location is definitely one of the nicer locations (they think they're fancy). Newer seating bigger location same great food!  Now funny enough I've eaten at teriyaki madness countless times and just realized today that extra spicy was an actual option. I used to just put extra sriracha sauce (cock sauce) on mine. So my suggestion if you enjoy spicy, go extra spicy then you can lay off the (cock sauce).   Extra spicy chicken white rice and a side of mac salad you  can't go wrong. You can leave teriyaki madness full to the gills and not feel like a total fatty."}
{"text":"I've never gone \"mad\" for teriyaki, but I sure do like a good chicken katsu, which is a protein option on their menu.  This is how ordering works:   1. Select either the bowl or plate option. 2. Choose your protein, base, and side.  I chose the chicken katsu with a brown rice base and a side of veggies. The overall bowl could seem bland to some taste buds without  sauce, but I thought it was decent without it and the extra sodium. I also ordered a chicken egg roll for its \"exciting\" description, but it was the opposite and tasted like the frozen variety found at some buffets and fast food places -- what a bummer.   Food is somewhat overpriced. A bowl costs over $8.00, and the egg roll was $1.99. To justify the cost, my main meal made me full, but I can't say that the egg roll was worth the price.  The service was good. I do like how orders are directly delivered to your table if you choose to dine in. There's plenty of booth seating, and the restaurant is clean.   When I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, there were hardly any diners, but I can imagine it being packed once the LVAC across the street opens."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here. Surprisingly fast and astonishingly delicious. The staff is somewhat nice about things yet you don't have to deal with them much. You order quickly and wait a few minutes.  Been to this new location a few times and will always come back."}
{"text":"Love this place. We always get the spicy chicken plate. We like our chicken well done and they never fail at making it just right!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the service isn't as good as the food! They have no public restroom though thought that was weird since you can sit there and eat!"}
{"text":"Have now been to Teriyaki Madness several times, tried a few different menu items. The food and service were consistently quite good each time. Teriyaki sauce is excellent and the veggies are fresh, and cooked to order while waiting. Will go back"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness has become my random go-to restaurant for Chicken Katsu and they do an amazing job with it. It's always crispy and flavorful and the sauce is the perfect combination of sweet and flavorful. The service is quick and friendly, and the prices are reasonable for a place that is half resturant/half fast food."}
{"text":"I eat here like once a week. Super friendly staff. The place is always clean. I call my orders in on my way home from work and they're always ready on time. Very consistent every time. Don't stray from the chicken teriyaki bowls."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since it opened and generally the food is decent, fresh and value priced. Recently however the food quality has been poor, overall poorly prepared and waits for food exceeding long.  As such I will no longer eat here and I have consistently been eating here for years. Last Friday my wife ordered chicken teriyaki plates.  When she came home they did not have any teriyaki sauce on them. She also had to wait well over a half and hour for the food. Additionally the plates were haphazardly put together, everything looked like crap. Don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"Went in with entertainment book $9 discount only received $2 off on two teriyaki dinners and two soft drinks. This place has poor customer service. Food was fairly good but chicken was dry."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years.  I recommend the spicy chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies.  Also, their lo mein is super good as well.  Great customer service and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"With a name like Teriyaki Madness, you know to expect corporate nonsense. This place is far better than Kyoto Bowl but not quite as good as Yogis.  Spicy teriyaki chicken was good but the fried rice was bland and the steamed veggies are a boring side. What wasn't good was the price. $10 for a Panda Express sized plate of food.   I had a bite of my friends orange chicken. Terrible! Barely even a hint of orange and kind of dry. We all wished we had gone to Panda :("}
{"text":"Food is delicious . Service is quick and food is amazing as always. I always love to come here to get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Another great place to eat when you don't feel like cooking. Prices are a bit high, but hey I guess if you want great food you gotta pay up!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to T-mads since I was in high school, and I must say, although the prices have DRASTICALLY increased, I still love their food!! I have been getting the same order for years! Spicy chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies! I have tried their orange chicken and teriyaki chicken, and most people say that the orange chicken has taken a turn down south. It isn't the same from before, however, this is only coming from someone who has been coming since long ago!   *TIP* I would give a call in advance if you know what you are going to get! I only suggest this because, sometimes it could get very busy and you'll end up waiting 10-15 min for your order!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious. Staff was polite, friendly and attentive. Very clean and well kept. The teriyaki sauce on the tables go great w anything. I definitely recommend an egg roll as a starter."}
{"text":"Ordered yakisoba noodles with chicken.  Seasoning on the noodles was good.  But, there were not enough of them.  Vegis weren't overcooked... done just right, and too many of them.  Chicken was tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty good, A-OK in fact! I had the veggie yakisoba noodle dish, and hubs got the chicken katsu. The side salad I ordered was pretty lame. Wilted lettuce and too sweet dressing, but for a buck and change, I wasn't terribly disappointed. My noodle dish was nice. Broccoli, cabbage and onions are the veggies. The teriyaki on the table was a nice addition to my noodles. I'd say the price is fair. Certainly not expensive, but not cheap and delicious like Ko-Mex. I might venture back here, it's close to my house, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Today was my first of many more to come visits to these location .. Awesome and yummy. So upset I waited so long to try Teriyaki Maddness."}
{"text":"Eaten here for years. Eaten in and take out. Today was a total joke. I like to relax and read news / sports on my phone. I had to listen to constant loud Spanish speaking ladies. Laughing and joking running back and forth to the kitchen coming back and laughing about something. I don't care what language you / we speak, customers don't want to hear loud workers period. If a customers / group came into the restaurant and made this much racket, staff would probably speak to them. Get control keep and grow business."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm in the twilight zone reading good, or even decent reviews of this place. Aside from the fact that it took forever to get our order, this was honestly some of the worst food I've had the misfortune of eating. Luckily, we used a Groupon, so it wasn't too much of a loss, but everyone in my party of 6 spit out and threw away most of their food. It was horrible. The chicken had the most unsettling, rubber-like consistency. At first we each individually thought we bit into an extra grisly piece. Until we realized that was actually how all the chicken was! Full disclosure, we are all from Seattle, so we grew up eating excellent teriyaki, but wow... If you're looking for good teriyaki, this isn't it."}
{"text":"Coming from the California where we have several popular teriyaki chains like Flame Broiler and Waba Grill, I was excited to try this place out. I came in early and the kid at the register was very helpful and friendly. He asked me if it was my first time there and showed me plate sizes. I ordered the chicken breast teriyaki bowl, with veggies and white rice. The chicken looked a little pale but I gave it a chance anyways. A few bites into it I get the crunch of undercooked chicken breast. I brought it to the attention of the manager who assured me it was to temperature. He offered me a replacement piece but at that point I loss my appetite. I tossed the food right after taking these pictures.   If you do decide to try this place out, ask for the chicken breast well done."}
{"text":"My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often.   Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure.   Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.  Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless.   Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as \"crazy good\" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere.   Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh.   Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on giving this place 4 vice 5 stars.  This because the food sometimes tastes a bit salty.  The price is fair and the service is always pleasant.  My family doesn't like it as much as I do, so I don't visit as often as I'd like to.  Hopefully, I'll be able to adjust my review to 5 stars after a few more visits... I REALLY want this to be my \"go to\" spot!"}
{"text":"This was a tough review, the crew looks lost and confused about everything, long slow order line, out of Beef and white rice, how does that happen on 6pm on a Friday night? But the food was really good, we got orange chicken and of course the Teriyaki Chicken. They need some serious training to get their employees up to par."}
{"text":"The food is really good.  Choice of rice I really like.  Prices are even more attractive.  Customer service is right on point.  Lot of kids work here but they are a cut above the usual young employees you find elsewhere.  These are well trained and polite and quick"}
{"text":"Rude staff, no greeting or even a hi! Little girls running the register need serious training in customer service but then again it's a fast food joint so one shouldn't expect excellent service"}
{"text":"Walked in to place a to go order, was put in the same wait line as a call in order. Waited over 14 min for food, the food was ready to go and sat on the counter as the staff forgot to call out my order. Then the order was wrong!!!! Crab Rangoon was flat, soggy and empty. They remade the order so I had to wait another 10 min to get my food, no I will just take a full refund and keep your food. Staff offered a free soda, no thanks!!!! Will just take the extra drive and go to the other location."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name. Yes there is teriyaki, and yes there is madness. However, the madness comes in the form of over priced, sub par food. While leaning over a \"salmon bowl\" I found myself feeling like a 12 year old that hadn't finished his chores. \"Finish your food, or you can't go outside\" said my Mom. \"But Mooooom I don't freaking WANT TO!\"  I snapped out of my flashback with a few bites left. I contemplated my life's decisions long enough for me to shovel the rest in my face hole and then got the hell out of there. I didn't even look back. And I never will."}
{"text":"What's there not to love about this place! I only wish they were open a little later. I have only tried the Teriyaki Bowls but I'm sure everything on the menu is good AND prices are fairly reasonable. Usually a large bowl is shareable with my kiddo! Momma on a budget! ;-) love it!"}
{"text":"We are both sicker than dogs after getting teriyaki chicken to go last night. My husband made a comment the sauce didn't look right when we brought the food home. He was violently ill all day and I have been all evening.  Good news, he said the service was great and the people were nice.   Great service is not worth the health consequences."}
{"text":"Love this terriyaki joint ! Scrumpdiliumptious."}
{"text":"For quick and semi-healthy meal.  Brown rice topped with chicken and side of steamed veggies. Can't go wrong.   All locations are very friendly, fast and efficient !"}
{"text":"I love this teriyaki madness. Great service and great food. I can never get tired of rice veggies and chicken. There are so many varieties and it's all healthier choices. I like to use coupons and save on my order."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years, and right now I'm loving it.  Service is great, food is great!  Right now I just can't get enough of this goodness. I got the Salmon bowl a couple of times, although I like the Salmon, it just dosn't go good with the bowl. I really like the crispy chicken, and you get alot of the crispy chicken."}
{"text":"My wife and i decided to try this place because we had passed it so many times. When we entered i was excited because i loved the music they were playing. We ordered 2 combination plates with chicken and beef and chicken and pork. Also we ordered crab rangoon and veggie egg roll. The egg roll was disgusting. It says veggie but there is way more going on there including tofu. The crab rangoon was the bomb. It was delightfully overstuffed and had a nice crispy shell. The chicken was grilled to perfection. The beef and pork tasted the same and had the same taste as the beef jerkey at the fantastic swap meet. The white rice was over cooked so it tasted hard. My opinon is only eat the crab rangoon. Take your $30.00 elsewhere and eat something with quality."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place sucks . It's dirty and the service is horrid. Last couple times I've TRIED to eat here it was \"cash only\",are you kidding ? Keep it up and you'll continue to lose business"}
{"text":"You have been warned and hey have signs letting you know their food is highly addictive  I pretty much eat there EVERY OTHER DAY! It's not just the food that I enjoy, Ajay, Erica, Kay and Haylee are sooo delightful towards their customers. I've been to other TMs but this location is the only one I will go to now just coz of the staff!!! I love how I walk in and they know you by name and greet you. Y your name! That's great customer service!!!! Thanks TM crew"}
{"text":"I love their food!!! I'm super addicted. They always make the food fresh to order. My favorite is the spicy chicken. It's very flavorful and has the perfect amount of smokiness to it. I love carbs, and I'm very picky when it comes to rice. I love how they don't use cheap, Chinese rice. Their white rice makes it even better to eat. I've also had their brown rice. It's really good. I bought a sack of brown rice, and I can never cook it the way they do. :( What I also love about them is their flexibility. They'll pretty much make it just the way you want it, and I'm a very picky girl. One last thing, their salad that comes with the plate is sooooo good. I've never had that type of dressing anywhere else. The lettuce is always fresh, and I am willing to eat it all day everyday.   One last thing, their service is always awesome. The owners are very kind. One time, they were out of water cups when I asked for one. He told me they didn't have any more water cups so he just gave me one of those cups you get when you buy a drink. How nice of him! I was honest. Swear I only got water. :)  This place is an example of \"you get what you pay for.\""}
{"text":"I've tried the food here a couple of times and I really haven't had the same experience I had when they were located on Warm Springs. Plus I really miss their pork teriyaki, so that really contributes to my review."}
{"text":"Sooooo very disappointed!!! We love the teriyaki madness in Mesa and counted down the days until the opened!! When we finally went around to going the food was horrible! The employee who checked us out was very rude. They were out of ice and didn't have the special that they were advertising and even had a sign out for! When we got our food back it was cold and gross. Save your money and get better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like this place. I've been here twice for togos and the food tastes great. I got the teriyaki bowl and chicken katsu/chicken teriyaki plate. My boyfriend really likes this place and their sauce is one of the better ones. I received a coupon in the mail for a Buy one get one free entree so keep your eyes out for it."}
{"text":"Horrible. Food is tasteless. Total lack of flavor. Floor & tables were filthy! Everything is served in a plastic bowl with a lid. The order comes up and the girl tux them into her ample stomach and screams out names. It's hard to think one would go into an Asian food restaurant and be wildly searching for the salt and pepper shakers!"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(266/365) \"Mad Flavor!\"  Sometimes you just don't feel like cooking and just want a quick meal, right?  Wifey brought home Teriyaki Chicken Bowls since we've never tried this place  before. I was pleasantly surprised at the flavors and also the portion size in this bowl! It was very delicious with the nice char flavor of the  chicken and the teriyaki sauce served with it wasn't too sweet or salty, just right.  Glad we finally got to try what the madness was all about, now I'm looking forward to trying their other offerings like the steak...ALOHA!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/    4"}
{"text":"Best teriyaki chicken!!!! Always great customer service and they've got a great selection of entrées to choose from.  Love the selection because there's something for everyone I go with to enjoy.  The restaurant is always kept in order and clean and the employees always have great energy.  Keep up the good work!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good fast food option. Friendly service, clean establishment and good quality food. We made an order to go and food was ready in 5 minutes. Faster than most drive thru places.   The food can be a little pricey at about $9 a plate but they send you some awesome deals via text message alerts so today we got the buy one plate, get one plate free with drink purchases. So our bill came out to $20 vs $30. Not a bad deal at all.   The Chicken Katsu was perfectly fried and flavored and the brown rice was of good quality. Didn't care too much for the macaroni salad side. It was kind of small and didn't have much flavor. I did enjoy the Chicken Gyoza but added some soy sauce to the Gyoza sauce because it was a little too sweet for my liking.   My hubby got the Spicy Chicken, it was very good. I loved the flavor. The noodles were a yummy side too. The stir fry veggie side, though, could've used some more flavor.   Overall good, quick service and good fast food. Maybe try the salad as a side instead though."}
{"text":"If I would have known 'The Veggies' consisted of a basic Iceberg Salad, I would have skipped it altogether. Not Good, AT ALL!"}
{"text":"ate here twice during Olympia weekend last year. great post workout meal !"}
{"text":"Placed order thru Door Dash.  Order arrived early.  Order was wrong.  Ordered extra sides of vegetables with each order.  They did not arrive.  Order mild kids teriyaki bowls, received spicy bowls.  Discovered this after my little ones said they could not eat their food and had to keep drinking water.  Called to have order corrected and re-delivered, they said they would give me a credit for a bowl from my next visit.  Why would I order from you again, when you can't get my order correct?  Terrible service."}
{"text":"UberEats delivery was quick and on time. Food was pretty good, this place definitely does not deserve 3 stars, it's a 4 star place. Wife did the spicy chicken teriyaki and I did the normal chicken teriyaki. The sauce is super good with the brown rice too! Would order again.  Edit Ordered again and the food quality was terrible, guess it's hit or miss. Reduced 1 star, I stand corrected."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out from this location. When ordering from teriyaki madness I order the same thing every time; which is a spicy chicken bowl extra spicy with double meat and double veggies. While we paid for this addition they did not provide the add-ons. However I do like them as a fast pickup option for lunch and dinner. The food tastes fresh and can be made as healthy as you like offering variations of grilled chicken and veggies."}
{"text":"I have been seeing billboards for this place for at least a couple years and I finally got around to trying it..... I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl with vegetables and it was AMAZING. The chicken was melt in your mouth tender, while still being charbroiled. Good mixture of lightly steamed veggies, perfectly cooked rice, and 100% spot on teriyaki sauce (not to salty OR sweet). Was a good value for what I paid and I wish that we had this chain in San Diego.  SO GOOD! SO FRESH! & not that horrible for you....."}
{"text":"Food was well flavored. Had the spicy chicken with brown rice and broccoli. The place was packed but we got our food within 7 minutes. And the customer service was on point. Most importantly the place was clean and inviting."}
{"text":"1STAR REVIEW UPDATE!!  So recently I came here and had a horrible experience. Mind that I am a regular teriyaki madness customer. Maybe not so much at this location. But I do come here at the very least once a week. Because this is the closest location from my home. So anyways, I had a horrible bowl made about a week ago or so. Or I thought was horrible. But after making my 1 star rant/review. On yelp. The owner of this location, Randy, had messaged me about it. And after going back and forth with him. Instead of just taking me as a bad customer and writing me off as a loss, he went seeking for a solution...  A couple days later, he messaged me saying He was using a different chicken that the other location that I go to almost every day was using. Keep in mind guys it's just an update that the fairly location Sahara/Decatur was already using.. He went forward and figured the problem out by calling the owner Robert at the Sahara/Decatur location just to find out what was going on Causing me to think that the bowl wasn't cooked fresh, etc...   So the end result keeping this review as short as possible. I have to give it out to Randy for taking that step to figure out what was going on and fixing the issue I was having. He took care of the bill for my dinner tonight, saying I had to go try out the new updated chicken that all locations are now using. Just so he had my approval of satisfaction... *People don't like the wait times...* BUT I have to say everything on the menu is cooked FRESH. Therefore, everything tastes amazing!! So give the waiting times some slack because the couple extra minutes you wait, I guarantee you will be worth it! Also hopefully Randy doesn't kill me for saying this, but they are giving the option to add avocado to the bowls/plates in the beginning of 2018!! Now that's the cherry on top to the amazing food they already serve! Please if you haven't ever tried TERIYAKI MADNESS. Please give this place a try! You won't ever look back!!   PS: don't expect Randy to take care of your bill... because there is nothing else to complain about after reading my review. lol"}
{"text":"The food here is good but for some reason today was different. The staff didnt explain the menu to me correctly, I asked for mild spice chicken and got noodles that were practically on fire. I had to poor 5 cups of teriyaki sauce to cancel the heat. To top that off I had literally 4 peices of chicken. My moms food cane as ordered exept she got rice instead of noodles.  Biggest down fall is the menu. The price on the board and menu is cheaper than when the actually charge. I got the \"our prices went up\" talk..not cool. I wasn't the only customer about the price change either. My suggestion is to call ahead of time and the facts right."}
{"text":"Took over an hour and a half for deliver. I paid extra for spicy on both my items. Neither was spicy. Meat was over cooked. Noodles were bland. All the veggies were watery and seemed overly steamed not stir fried. I would not eat her again after this experience. Also i left a note to call me when they arrived and they failed to do so. Feel like I just wasted money."}
{"text":"Teriyaki places have never been my favorite. Because my wife loves them, however, I have to eat at them quite frequently.  I'm thrilled to have found a a restaurant that not only makes her happy, but I enjoy as well.  I'm addicted to hot and spicy food. More often than not, I will be happy with a place as long as my food is tasty and makes me sweat from the level of spice. Teriyaki Madness has this going for it.  You can request your food to be extra spicy and they will fulfill this wish, unlike most places that give the option. The spicy teriyaki chicken ordered extra spicy comes out fiery red. It doesn't seem hot at first but it quickly builds to extremely hot with each bite.  Probably my favorite aspect of this place is the freshness. Teriyaki Madness delivers the convenience of Asian fast food Asian restaurants like Panda Express, with the quality of a full service dine-in place.  This location is usually wonderful. Only once has my order been messed up, but nothing too serious. Food just about always comes out steaming hot, so I can't really complain about anything."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken, spicy beef, you cannot go wrong when ordering. The benefit to this restaurant is they offer healthy sides such as grilled veggies and brown rice with your order."}
{"text":"The food is sooo good and seems really clean and healthy.  Their calorie count baffles me though since their study fry veggies seem to have more calories than their rice option.  Whatever it is, the food is delicious and love that it is a very healthy portion amount of food!"}
{"text":"MADNESS IN A BOWL! I Usually eat the Beef Yakasaba medium spicy. Tonight, I had the chicken breast teriaki with steamed veggies, and rice.   Great prices, Quality food. I get take out from this place regularly."}
{"text":"Alright so my bf eats here literally everyday for lunch on his lunch breaks and wouldn't stop talking about it so i decided to go with him one night. Food is pretty dam great I can see why he would come here so much. We got the spicy chicken plate which is what he always orders mmm very delicious and very very spicy which I likey! My Lil man got the kids Teriyaki chicken bowl which I stole a few bites from also delicious. They have generous portions good quality food and its fast I don't blame my bf for being so obsessed with this place its pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Ok i had to write another review and up this place to 5 stars  This place has a sign outside that says \"warning highly addicting\" its so true!!!  Since i went here the 1st time i haven't been able to stay away id say I probably eat here at least 3 times a week NO JOKE! I love this place and cant get enough of their Spicy Chicken Plate the chicken is good quality and the sauce they use is sooo yummy and very spicy they give two generous scoops of rice to go with it as well as a delicious salad that has a sweet dressing. I always order the spicy chicken plate and if you like spicy you wont be disappointed.  Great food Good service  HIGHLY ADDICTING"}
{"text":"The veggie stir fry was nasty.  It contained 90% of old cabbage that had a mildew smell and they didn't give me the veggies I asked for.  I took 2 bites and just about vomited.  I tried to get the attention of the cashier but there were some obnoxious teenagers in there, she was talking to and I just tossed the food out and left.  Waste of my $9"}
{"text":"I like this place, price is reasonable, fast & easy , good tasting food. However tonight was a big disappointment for me,  I guess I went towards close to closing time, the rice I got was half mushy & half cook. I would still come back but not very soon."}
{"text":"Had a craving for teriyaki. Just moved down here from WA state where we had mom and pop teriyaki places on each corner. This is the closest I'll get down here I guess. The flavors were good however my salmon was cold in the middle! When I brought it to their attention, they were vey apologetic and made me a new bowl. The bowls look small but are very filling. Also had the crab rangoons, I'm a sucker for greasy imitation crab and they fit the bill. I would come again to try some of their meats that they grill (chicken and beef), not just nuke up like the salmon."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! We tried this place about 8 months ago. It was very good. Over the last several visits the quality and service has been steadily going down hill. Last night I called in my order at 6:05 . My wife arrived at 6:15 to pick up and food was not ready, What really is aggravating is watching several people coming in ordering and receiving their food before our order. My wife asked more than once what is taking so long and cashiers response was \"I don't know\", Eventually the food was ready at 6:40. It was room temperature (scary for chicken). Also finding a lot of fat in the chicken. Seriously 35 minutes for pick up after calling in! Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"First, 4 stars part,  huge portion of white rice great texture of noodle ($1 extra kind) good flavor of teriyaki chicken  Eggroll hot and crunchy (flavor is mild) .  2 stars part Crab Ragoon, is actually 4 tiny pieces of Crab Wontons, $3.99 , that is ridiculous Yelp page shows huge portion, we didn't have the luck.  I assume their portion and quality is not consistent. We had Spicy Terriyaki Chicken, all I tasted was sugary dry hard chicken. (If you had to go to this place, Regular Teriyaki Chicken is so much better than Spicy Terriyaki Chicken.)  Without drinks, two terriyaki plate $8.99 plus $8.99. Eggroll $1.99. Crab Rangoon $3.99. Noodle replace rice, extra $1. Total bill plus tax, almost $30 for just fast food lunch to go. Not a place for budget minder."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about, not amazing but pretty good especially for the price. Good place to get some teriyaki or other types of Asian style food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Holden never made eye contact with us while taking our order. Was short and rude with me and when he brought us our food he slammed it on the table and walked away. Food was good but will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Love love love the chicken egg rolls. Seriously addicting. A must have . This restaurant is a fresh breath of new life in Mesa. Very much needed and certainly worth the extra 2 bucks you spend to get quality vs a fast food rest that serves less than par food ."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out the newest location and as before love this place even more. Great location. Food was super great! Staff was wonderful and rockin it for a new restaurant. Most of the time new locations suffer but they nailed it again! A must try!!! Be gentle people , it's not easy to run a restaurant and we welcome this awesome place to the community. A breath of fresh Air. Something different, yet fast and healthy all in one package! And the price is right on point, and I even had enough to reheat it later, for a 2nd helping all for one price. My favorite!!!"}
{"text":"This is starting to become my go to spot for a quick, tasty, healthy meal as I am into the Spicy Chicken Power Bowl with veggies. Have not had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"T-Mad is awesome!  Every time I come here, I always leave satisfied.  The food is always fresh and very tasty.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu but some standouts are the teriyaki chicken, beef, and the spicy chicken.  For a healthy option, I substitute stir fry veggies.  The only reason it's not 5 stars is because of the up charges for substitutions.  Pretty much every substitution costs at least a buck.  By itself it pretty cheap but ads up with options."}
{"text":"Ate there twice while staying Vegas. Got chicken teriyaki once and beef teriyaki once. It's worth the extra money to get the plate versus the bowl because there is much more food. Also got pot stickers and edamame. Edamame was very good. Pot stickers were OK."}
{"text":"Fast and fresh!  I also always take the bowls home, they are great for storing stuff in. Great Food, and great service! They offered to bring my dogs a water bowl, and made them a bowl of chicken."}
{"text":"I'd give it less stars if possible. Nothing fresh about this Asian grill. This is the second time I've tried this place. The order came out wrong (for the second time) and the rice is so soggy i couldn't even eat it. Had to throw it out. Definitely a pass on this place :/"}
{"text":"The food is exceptional. The staff is always friendly. The staff know the product and are able to address questions you have about things. The menu is a little small, but all things are done extremely well. The price is a little high, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"five stars all the way we keep coming back for the spicy chicken teriyaki bowl, the veggies that come with it are cooked perfectly and not too soft or too hard and the meat to rice portion is perfect! I also tried the potstickers, they were good but the teriyaki bowl filled me up fast so I'll prob just stick with just getting that. medium prices for the food, not to high by not super cheap."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of teriyaki places, usually the chicken is too dry or the sauce is off.   This teriyaki place is amongst the best I've ever had! The chicken is moist, the sauce is on point. I eat here at least once a week.   The service is quick, the food is great, and it's actually healthy! I recommend it for you and your family."}
{"text":"I cannot way how disappointed I am. Tonight we tried this place again for probably the third or fourth time. This was the worst experience. The cost was average, but the food was by far terrible. The steak in my meal was like jerky. My husband got a steak bowl and his meat was a completely different meat, it was a different cut, color and texture to it. The veggies were sopping and not like stir fry or steamed at all. Sadly we won't be back and will seek other places for terriyaki from here on out."}
{"text":"Order the teriyaki chicken with noodle. Very few piece of chicken total 5 piece all dice up.. I dont think that is valueable....dirty table. Flies fly everywhere....not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food here is great, but I haven't even gotten it yet. It was me and one other person waiting in front of me in line in an empty restaurant with two employees at the registers. Both employees were tied up on the phone taking to-go orders and it felt like it eternity.   Employee also wasn't very good at understanding my question when I asked him what the difference between an entrée low-carb chicken meal was and a veggies only with chicken plate was. The chicken plate with veggies was about two dollars cheaper so I figured I would ask.  Anyways there are still about six people sitting in chairs now with no food in front of them and I'm sure at least a half dozen or more takeout/delivery orders that they are working on so I doubt that I will be getting my food anytime soon. I sure have not gotten it while I wrote this fairly long review so what does that tell you?"}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place.  I always get the beef and chicken combo with fried rice.    I just inhale it.  Maybe one of these days, I'll actually take my time, chew and savor the wonderful flavors."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken bowl with veggies and brown rice is amazing!  18 points so its a great on program lunch if you're like me and doing Weight Watchers.  The staff is friendly and the place is always very clean despite how busy they are."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price. Mac salad needs to be seasoned better the one I got tasted pretty bland. Stir fry veggies needs to be cooked a little bit more and a better chicken for the katsu could be used, store bought just don't cut it for quality. The upside is the store is very clean and inviting. I would come back again but  would try something on the menu that hopefully would blow me away."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken with yakisoba noodles and vegetables is great. Will come back again."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken was excellent. The servings were generous. All the sodas were flat----the machines ran out of carbonation. Service was fast and friendly. Would come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Been to other teriyaki madness and all other places much better than this location u could see the workers planing around in the back food was not that great in this location"}
{"text":"Meh. Teriyaki for caucasians. Meat was ok, loaded up with sugary bottle teriyaki sauce. Kind of a fast food vibe. Sorry for the harsh review, but I'm married to an Asian woman, and I know what real Japanese & Asian food is like. This place is like  \"McAsian\". Yuk."}
{"text":"Well I'd just like to preface that if I could give this location zero stars I would. The restaurant was empty with the exception of about a half dozen of people in line at the cash register. This was my first time so I surveyed the menu with my fiancé and after about 5 minutes went by we realized no one was at the register and the people in line before us hadn't even been greeted. After another 5 minutes went by the line continued to grown and still the original patrons at the front of the line hadn't been helped. We left because we thought this would be quick service but clearly not. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by stating that I absolutely LOVE Teriyaki Madness.  I've been eating the Spicy Chicken since 2006. This store though is pathetic. The guy who works in the kitchen and he might even run the place is a clown. He took my order wrong last time and then actually started talking tough with me from behind the counter claiming that I ordered it wrong. He didn't shut his mouth about it until I told him to come outside and keep running his mouth.  I ordered a spicy chicken plate with veggies and they gave me white rice. The best part is I NEVER order white rice because I don't eat white rice. I ALWAYS order it with veggies or BROWN FRIED RICE... Again I never order it with white rice, but he insisted on calling me a liar and saying I ordered it wrong. Well I refused to go back to this location but my wife wanted this food really bad so we decided to order over the phone. A guy took the order. She ordered 5 menu items and 2 of them were orange chicken bowls with noodles. Well the guy read the order back and said 2 teriyaki chicken bowls with noodles and she corrected him by telling him they were supposed to be orange chicken bowls with noodles and he said \"we call it a teriyaki bowl\" and she said okay. I told her \"watch the order will be wrong\". Well sure enough when she goes in to pick the order up they had 2 teriyaki chicken bowls with noodles instead of 2 orange chicken bowls with noodles.  How hard is it to take an order? But I'm sure my wife ordered it wrong! Too bad the food is good because I would love to never go back!!"}
{"text":"Rude employees! Where is the customer service... I asked a simple question about a dish and treated like I was an idiot. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place all across town and had it bookmarked for the day I was look for something quick and somewhat healthy compared to the usual, guilty, but oh so satisfying In-N-Out trip. I had subscribed to their texts where they will send out blast coupon every now and then which is a definite plus.   We ordered a spicy chicken bowl with veggies and chicken teriyaki bowl. Both of the meats were super tender and juicy which is hard to do with white meat. It didn't take long for walking in and ordering take out. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My boyfriend isn't as thrilled as I am--he thinks it's more Korean style meat, and he doesn't like how the chicken breast in the all white chicken bowl only has sauce poured on it, instead of marinated. The spicy chicken plate is very flavorful. Yum!  I'm a big fan of the pork teriyaki, although it seems like it takes lot longer to prepare. The rangoons are delicious as well!"}
{"text":"The seats are plenty large. The food is made to order, so it takes a few minutes but comes out piping hot! The double meat plate is where it's at, but the spicy chicken is a must. I get a side of the sauce as well."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a good healthy meal, after reading the other reviews. But I really didn't like it. My teriyaki beef and chicken were very sweet for my taste. And yes, I've eaten teriyaki before... but this was, to me, like a syrup. My veggies weren't much to write home about either. They were very soggy and without much flavor.  I was hoping for good, but I hate to say that I've had better Lean Cuisine. Maybe I just hit them on an off night, so I'm being generous with my 3 stars."}
{"text":"Like coming here for healthy teriyaki bowls and other meals, give you good portions quickly made too. Also like the egg rolls. Price is good for the portions."}
{"text":"Ok place for the price sometimes fresh sometimes cold. Portions are ok for the price but do have different items to pick from service is good. Better off eating there."}
{"text":"Good food and great selection for the kids too.   Staff is friendly and accommodating for picky eaters. Good comes out hot and tastes fresh.  Dining area is clean and they even have a couple large flat screen TV's for those that are wanting to catch the game scores.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"Great food but seriously 30 minutes to get my food when there aren't that many people here? I had the chicken plate and pot stickers and they were good! I don't know if I would come back considering there are so many places like this that serve the food much faster!"}
{"text":"The food here is okay. The vegetables seem to be frozen, and I don't believe the macaroni salad is made in house. Today, my side of macaroni salad was delivered with a large piece of clear plastic in it. I did see the plastic before I ate it, and was kindly given a new one from an employee. The employees here are kind, efficient and helpful. So that's a plus, but the food is just okay."}
{"text":"I became very disappointed with this location after a while. Everything was great when they opened up the restaurant, eventually  the quality and service went down hill. When I ordered carryout they always forgot to include salads or sides. The quality of the food was dry and old. I left various messages to talk with manager but calls were not returned. I stopped  going to  this  location to avoid the bad service."}
{"text":"I come here often. I really like the food but the service and quality of the food continues to go down. I was here for lunch today. I got to the restaurant at 12:15. I ordered my teriyaki chicken plate with white rice and veggies. I was given my total and swooped my card. As soon as I paid the cashier said that'll be at least 20 minutes as we are out of white rice??  It is lunch hour, not late but not early either. He couldn't tell me that before I paid?  I told him I couldn't wait 20 minutes for rice and he said well I'll give you all veggies. Okay fine I said. I was given my food at 12:43. Since 20 minutes had passed I asked if the white rice was done, 15 minutes he said. While waiting for my food I heard so many other customers upset about no rice. Also, this is at least the third time I've been here in the last few months and they have been out of rice.   So I got home and opened my food. Where are all the veggies?  A lot of the chicken was burned and there was a lot of liquid at the bottom of my plate making the veggies and chicken almost taste soggy. I ended up giving it to my dog who loved it. Big waste of money for me though.  Someone removed one of my pictures. Placing it back."}
{"text":"I made a special trip to to eat here, at first place is really clean, but those looks decieved me, the cashier was not attentive acted like she was bothered by our presense, i watched that same cashier marry bottles of hot sauce, by the time i got home, i had to sit on the toilet for some time, i got sick from eating there.  Will not go there again, i never should have  cheated on Aloha Kitchen."}
{"text":"Quick service, delicious food and friendly staff. I got the Chicken teriyaki bowl with white rice and veggies and it absolutely hit the spot, I can't wait to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Food is alright nothing to brag about.  Service on the other hand needs help.  Let me start by describing our experience from the moment we walked into the store.  Everything was great up until we ordered.  No one was in line so it went south very fast.  The girl helping us \"seemed\" nice, but detracted.  There was another customer eating and started complaining about her order.  The girl taking our order was more interested in that conversation than our order.  My boyfriend ordered a chicken bowl for himself and an orange chicken for me.  We asked is they had water cups and she said yes and gave us one cup for 1 people.  I guess you have to be very literal at this place.  We got our order with in 5 mins.  They were both chicken bowls and no orange chicken.  We took it back up to the counter and she looked at us and acted like we told her 2 chicken bowls.  A guy comes around the counter and slams the receipt and she says \"it's going to take a few mins.\"   Mistakes happen we understand.  We both work in the service industry.  But no apology? And the attitude we get is not appreciated. Some advice to the manager of this store.  Your employees will drive your business down, you should find someone who can pay attention and is willing to admit when they mess up."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken was good, what you expect to get when you decide to eat from Teriyaki Madness. The macaroni salad however, was not, and I was quite disappointed. The coolness of the macaroni salad against the spicy of the chicken is my favorite part of the meal. Based on my most recent meal, this TM location doesn't know how to maintain a recipe. I spoke with a Mgr. named Jose who told me they hadn't changed the recipe but they did change the mayonnaise they use. To me it tasted like less mayo had been used and more celery had been added... whatever it was, it wasn't pleasing to my palate. After calling the location to inquire about a changed recipe, I understand why customers come here to vent. Small business owners, franchise owners/operators, PLEASE train your employees how to answer the phone!"}
{"text":"There are quite a few TMs around Vegas and the few I've visited have all given me decent spicy chicken bowls. This location though...they have an extremely friendly & personable, curly haired cashier named Marco. The spicy chix bowls were top notch too. The mac salad was a little off though. It wasn't spoiled, it was just lacking in flavor somewhat. Teriyaki Madness menu gurus, the mac salad is a REALLY important component of the spicy chix bowl experience. Please research L&L BBQ's recipe. Thank you!"}
{"text":"If you want to wait 30 minutes for one simple order, this is the place for you! Otherwise - go somewhere else. Such a waste of time.   And the layout of the restaurant is awful. People are crammed in there like sardines."}
{"text":"I first tried this location in the first month of its opening and I was hooked! The cashiers are very nice and keep a smile on their face while taking your order. The tables are unkept and remain clean. You have the food brought to you if they see you are dining in. One of my favorite things is the well oversized, astounding resolution tv they provide for you with sports always on. Back on track, it comes down to the food. Being the first place Ive discovered with spicy orange chicken I could never go another direction. The price may be very slightly above average, compared to a Panda Express, but the quality of the chicken, flavorful noodles, and teriyaki sauce is well worth the extra couple dollars. They continue to earn my business and remain convenient for my lunches."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night after a long days work. The place was busy and inviting. They opened on Monday and since I was already a fan of Teriyaki Madness , I went in with expectations. Thy were met and then some! This location delivered above and beyond customer service IMO. We chatted with the owner for a couple of minutes while the cashier took care of us. Her enthusiasm and great attitude were contagious! Came in feeling blah but left with smiles on our faces thanks to the conversation. Food was delicious as expected but the veggies were also much crisper and fresh tasting than at other TM's in the valley. You can tell that these franchisees are passionate about what they do. Stop in. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing the cashier aylin was extremely helpful and knowledgable and took the time to help me figure out my order! the foood is amazing! the portions are fairly decent compared to other teriyaki joints so i am extremely satisfied with my meal!"}
{"text":"It's some really really good food here! Glad I finally stopped in to try it. I'm giving it 4 stars tho because a piece of hair that wasn't mine, was in my food! Ugh!!"}
{"text":"I usually try to go here at least once a week. The food is always good and consistent. The teriyaki bowl is awesome! It's a nice change from fast food and tastes clean. The staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Chicken bowl was perfect!! Customer Service was excellent.. I love coming to this location.. Food came out in a timely manner.. Didn't have to wait too long to order my food.. Will definitely keep coming back to this location..."}
{"text":"I loved visiting the Teriyaki Madness behind the strip when I got off work. So I was very excited when this location popped up so close to my house.  I took my 2 friends who were visiting from out of town there for a quick lunch. We all have different tastes in foods so picking a restaurant is usually an ordeal. But we were all quickly able to find something we wanted on the menu.  The dining area of the location is very clean as were the the kitchen surfaces you can see from up front.  You can see the grill from the front & the fresh chicken they were cooking smelled great. The food was great & everything came out hot & fast.   The reason I am leaving this review, however, is due to how sweet all the staff were. They all had great energy & were able to give great suggestions. They brought the food to our table & were very attentive to our overall experience. Even came back to make sure everything was good & offered us boxes for our leftovers.   Super happy to have this location right down the street. I will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Had a rocky start, but I'm coming back for more! I had a dissatisfying first experience, but the owner took care of everything and I'm totally willing to try again for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious food. Phone orders always ready when promised. Food is always fresh. Friendly workers."}
{"text":"Their chicken teriyaki with fried rice is bomb.  Very fresh and seems to be high quality ingredients.  They only thing I have had here that I don't like are the veggies.  They have way too much oil, and almost a burnt type taste.  It is always consistently like that, wasn't just a one time thing."}
{"text":"Love this place I live 4 mins from here and when I'm craving teriyaki style chicken this is my place!! I love the spicy chicken with brown rice and veggies. You really can't go wrong with anything one the menu. And the crab Rangoon are to die for!!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing to get from Teriyaki Madness is the chicken spicy noodle bowl. You can't really mess it up, and the chicken tastes like chicken and it's not underdone.   So far, the food is okay and decent, but not much more than you would expect from a Teriyaki Madness!"}
{"text":"Definitely mad in love with this place. It's hard to find any protein drenched with teriyaki served in a fair quantity for a reasonable price. Simply, I recommend the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl with Rice & Veggies."}
{"text":"Great food and great portions! The spicy teriyaki is amazing and egg rolls were awesome! We plan on making this a regular!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for the price. The food is fresh and tasty, the vegetables are crisp, and they have options to make it reasonably healthy (like getting all vegetables instead of rice). This was the best meal under $10 I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"They tend to start doing the restaurants closing duties early. So if you drive by and the chairs are up, they're mopping, and the rest of the employees are in the back gossiping, then that's normal..even if it's 45 minutes before closing time. And the food will taste like shit because everyone just wants to go home."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I had the spicy teriyaki chicken with vegetables and brow rice...and an egg role. Pretty good flavor, the spicy was very mild, barely noticed it.  Would go back again if I wanted something along that line."}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab some lunch and what a huge disappointment. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with no sauce and brown rice. The chicken was WAY over cooked to where when I took it home to eat as a second meal, the chicken was so dry I ended up throwing the rest away. Some pieces were so overcooked it was inedible.   That's ok.. I'll stick with my Teriyaki Madness by my house in the northwest. But nope, not going to return back here."}
{"text":"While my orange chicken was delicious, it's not what I wanted. I asked for chicken breast teriyaki, but they were out of chicken breast...at lunchtime! To make up for it, I was given a free egg roll - yum!"}
{"text":"The teriyaki sauce was awesome but we made the mistake of ordering the chicken bowl instead of \"chicken breast bowl\". Therefore, our meat was all fat and chewy."}
{"text":"The other reviews are correct about this particular location.  The staff are very unwelcoming and the food is not as good as the other locations.  To be specific, the large guy who is usually at the register seems to hate being there and takes it out on the customers.  He is constantly touching himself and then handling the food.  The only reason I go back is because it is a far drive to another one and my gym is across the street."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Ordered a spicy chicken breast bowl with brown rice. Pretty good with a kick.. Really like that they have brown rice! Staff is nice, place is clean. A little small inside, there is also a bagel place connected. They brought over samples of muffins! Cinnamon muffin was yummy too!!"}
{"text":"When I travel to Vegas I always make a stop at Teriyaki Madness.  This one is much newer and very clean, much bigger too vs. the others down south.  I always get the low carb plate, spicey chicken, double meat!  Huge portions and their spicey chicken has a very nice flavor I have yet to get any where else.  ESPN on the TV and a nice lunch experience."}
{"text":"Really liked this place but this is the second time I recently found hair throughout my food. Thought the first time was a fluke but nope....hair in my food again. Gross."}
{"text":"After a long drive we made it to Vegas and ended up eating here. Great food and open till 10! Delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious especially for how fast it is made. You don't feel sick after like some togo Asian food. Food is made to order and the workers have all been pretty nice. I would give it a five star but every time we go the tables or the floor or something else could be cleaner. Overall great food great price. We probably go weekly."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. Love this spot. The cute Latina lady behind the counter with the red shirt that's been here for like at least three years is always so sweet and good at her job. Food is excellent. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Great food but to me it seems a little pricey when I order white meat, brown rice and veggies. One buck for veggies are you serious? Will keep going back  though and love the spicy chicken."}
{"text":"Food has always been good but I'm so sick how bad service is. Employees counting tip jar instead of cleaning all the filthy tables. Dirty! Going to be while before I try this place again"}
{"text":"Average meal.  Chicken on the dry side. Plenty of chicken in bowl.  The background music was annoying."}
{"text":"It's ok. The food is good but nothing special a little pricey for what you get. Had the spicy chicken teriyaki bowl asked for extra spicy it was not. The brown rice was so bland you really need to doctor it up. I like the veggies in the bowl adds to taste. Will probably try again"}
{"text":"Decent food. Good service.  If you're having asian cravings for a savory dish that's non-fried...this is your place.  Their sweet teriyaki sauce on the side is not memorably awesome, but it's definitely a great addition to whatever dish you decide upon."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I'm a creature of habit and always get the white meat chicken bowl w extra chicken and w brown rice!  Try adding more of their teriyaki sauce for more flavor.  This location is clean and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Not bad Teriyaki chicken for a chain!   I got the spicy Chicken with brown rice and I wished I'd have tried the noodles with it.    The rest of my party seemed to enjoy it as well.   I got it extra spicy and the extra spicy was a little weak IMO.   It didn't blow me away, but A-OK with me.... I don't think you can go wrong with this place.    Worth a try to see what you think."}
{"text":"Had take out from here tonight. Terrible experience. Wait time was so freaking long. Tons of customers came in after me and left before me. Staff didn't care. 8 people working in the back no one even acknowledged that I've been waiting forever. Then asked what's taking so long they said, \"oh your order is next\". What!?! I've been here for 30 minutes! People have come and gone long after me and I'm still next!?!  Anyways, of course the food was cold. I only live 4 minutes alway. This place sucks. I guess you can say they left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is my GO TO spot for takeout!! These guys do American Teriyaki right. Really sweet dishes, friendly people, and a clean place. I go here about once a week when I have a night in and want to grab some great lo mien noodles, steak or chicken, and some egg rolls. Savory and filling!   Basically the Smash Burger equivalent of chinese/asian cuisine. Don't expect world class food... Just really good comfort food!   Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"It was delicious, they got my order perfectly correct and it didn't take that long. It is there first week being open so the chefs have not perfected there craft! Don't expect the best teriyaki madness from a brand new joint! Give it some time, let it marinate. And the chefs cooked up some bomb food too. That's why I'm writing this review. It was delicious! And fresh! And a great spot in a prime location. Expect a visit from me a few times a month!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant. I was completely surprised that they simply took teriyaki sauce and drizzled it over the chicken breast, rather than cooked the meat in the sauce. I had the brown rice, also and it was a bit lukewarm. The food was bland. I also visited right when they opened and appeared to be the first customer of the day. I most likely will not return. It was not worth the money."}
{"text":"Best T-Mads in Vegas!! I've been to other location around town and I always regret it. The service here is always exceptional and the employees are awesome!!"}
{"text":"I get it I came near closing and you wanted to go home. I also excused the fact the guy felt the need to remind me of that. This is my second bowl in two days because I've been trying to eat pretend healthy but I would like to be full. I was already frustrated because I forgot to add avocado when i ordered, I then open my bowl to THIS .. I'm  so irritated at the fact that if I ask for only veggies and chicken breast I get a few strings of cabbage, two pieces of broccoli and a few zucchini... I could understand the portion of veggies if I had rice  I'm so pissed .. two stars for the awesome taste   *update .. I've changed my two stars to 5 thanks to the owner Randy and his humility when reaching out to me to make an upsetting situation into an great experience the second time around. Not only was he generous enough to treat myself and my husband to dinner, he showed genuine interest in keeping a loyal customer excuse me, ALL of his customers satisfied when spending their hard earned money. I'll continue to frequent this location as often as I do. Now that I've written my update I think I'll stop by again before they close  wish they stayed open till 10 on weekends"}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count, the food is always amazing and the cashiers are very friendly. I'm never disappointed with my meal and its even more refreshing that we can see the staff make our food!"}
{"text":"Yep! I'm a fan!  I have a difficult time finding places to eat that are quick, delicious and hold their own in the nutrition department; luckily, Teriyaki Madness is right up that alley. :) The Chicken Bowl with Brown Rice & Veggies is the biz! I crave it constantly. I wish I new how to cook rice to perfection like they do. The Teriyaki Sauce has a great flavor, and is a perfect mix of sweet and savory. The helpings are huge and I'm able to split it up into three meals throughout the day. $8 for a fat bowl. I'm sure I'll be somewhat of a regular, as this location is right up the road from where I work."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Ordered my plates and repeated everything and the guy repeated them too. While I was trying to order my food it's as if the guy wasn't even listening because he kept confirming the wrong plate! Got my plate and it was the wrong order!!! I couldn't even stay in the restaurant to dine because they set they AC at 91 degrees, obviously they didn't want anyone eating in there."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken is great but the bowls are 95% rice and 5% meat which is not good!! I thought this place might be better! Disappointed"}
{"text":"The food tastes great... However, as I walked in there's only one lady at the front ringing in orders and answering phones. The line is to the door. I tried to call our order in before I left work but phone lines were busy or disconnected so we had to place our order once we got there.  We finally got to the front and ordered our food at 12:05. We received our food at 12:46, after I asked where it was. (There were about 30 people waiting for their food at this point )  They didn't even have our order, they found half of it but had to make my husband's. After receiving our food mine was not even hot anymore because it had been sitting out. I also had to leave to go back to work and left my husband eating alone. I got an apology but it ruined my lunch. I wouldn't recommend going here on lunch break. Food is good but not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"It is what it is flavored grilled meat with rice and I added veggies. The Mac salad something is missing not the one I'm used to."}
{"text":"This place is great! If you're looking for food that's quick, has healthy options and is delicious this is where to go! The staff is friendly and helpful. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"We're visiting from California and always stop at a Teriyaki Madness on our way home. This was our first time at this location and they have the same good food as the other locations we've been to, but their customer service is above average. All the workers were hustling but remained so kind and personable . We will be back next time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Madness location. Cool AC in summer. Clean. Dining room is clean. Staff is always nice and helpful. The quality on the bowls are great as well as the portions. Personal fav is spicy chicken with fried rice."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (23 of 365). I have a lot of catching up to do!  If you're craving a quick teriyaki meal, this place is your best bet.  They take call in orders for immediate pick up, but to order and wait, it doesn't take that long either.  They have quite a few options and I love that they have the option to have brown rice with your meal, or noodles.  I always order the chicken or beef teriyaki bowl with brown rice, a side of macaroni salad, shrimp tempura, and if I'm really hungry, I'll even add some fried gyoza.  The food definitely fills me up as the portions are a good zie, it tastes good, and is still good if you want to save a little bit for later on in the day.   The zip code booklets in the mail usually have a coupon for this place, or check your Von's Market coupon too!"}
{"text":"I love Teriyaki madness but this one is a joke. I called my order in and any time I order over the phone I make sure to be very clear so the order isn't messed up. I ordered two bowls, one chicken teriyaki with fried rice and one chicken teriyaki, dark meat only, white rice and veggies. My husband comes home from picking it up and mine has fried rice and has both white and dark meat. So my husband goes back and they tell him oh we have your order sorry we put the wrong one in and they repeat my order back to him, just like they did to me on the phone, and he says yep that's right. He gets it home, its white rice and veggies but ALL white meat chopped up when I didn't order chopped. I will never go to this one again, I'd rather go to the other down the street that has 5 star ratings. Don't go here"}
{"text":"Me and my gf's go to all the time. Great chicken great terriyaki sauce and great service. Mmmm can we say delicious? Well I sure can!!"}
{"text":"The food taste as nasty as their customer service.  If you know real food you would not eat here."}
{"text":"Update:  I did not have a pleasant experience when trying to phone in my order. I ended up going in and the same cashier that I attempted to place an order with was the same not-so pleasant cashier. However, to turn a negative situation into a HUGE positive, the owner called me and apologized for what happened. For this reason, I am GLAD to give Teriyaki Madness 5 stars. The food is truly delicious! Their brown rice is one of my favorites! The portions are fairly large and reasonably priced. And, try an egg roll! Addictive!"}
{"text":"This is a nice quick food option with grilled chicken teriyaki bowls that remind me of a family favorite where I grew up.  The teriyaki is flavorful without being too salty, and the veg and chicken were cooked perfectly.  With a pickup order they included extra teriyaki and all the utensils (which is not always a given) I'll definitely be back for a guilt free lunch/dinner.  But they should have teriyaki chicken wings too though, then it'd be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was great and the place was super clean- good energy and everybody's smiling  what more can you ask for?? I got the teriyaki beef and spicy chicken bowl with Gyoza's on the side and everything was on point- thanks for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Great service! Delicious food!  My favorite spot for any type of teriyaki or orange chicken! The service is fast and the food is always Fresh and hot off the grill! Highly recommend to anyone who likes teriyaki chicken!"}
{"text":"Never been let down yet. Chicken Yakisoba is my fav!! Make sure you find and use a buy 1 get 1 free coupon. I mix the red chili sauce and teriyaki and make my own spicy addition. Love this quick lunch place and their friendly staff!"}
{"text":"5/5 friendly service, great food, great price. You can never go wrong with the chicken teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"I give this place one star. The food is horrible & they put a small amount. Also they always mess up with our order. Panda Express is way better. Save your money before going to this place."}
{"text":"Wow! Just WOW!... When I first came into Teriyaki Madness I  was greeted by a very friendly staff. I ordered the Spicy Chicken bowl with veggies on brown rice with an egg roll in the side...OMG! absolutely amazing flavor! The flavors of each ingredient were clean clear crisp and distinguishable yet incorporated well with the others in the dish. The brown rice was steamed to perfection mild in flavor with the perfect level of nuttiness. The egg roll was very delicious as well. My only disappointment is that there aren't any Teriyaki Madness in California where I'm from....not that I need a reason to come back the Vegas area... I will definitely hit up this Teriyaki Madness next time I visit!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this restaurant since we were out running errands and did not want to cook. And who does not do teriyaki ? They teriyaki everything here and it is wonderful. I was greeted by a wonderful cashier whom took my order. Then we sat down and waited for the food. It smells so good in this restaurant even now while I sit here and eat too.   I ordered a beef teriyaki bowl and an orange chicken bowl both with veggies. The orange chicken was cooked really well and tasted fresh and not processed. The steak was cooked with teriyaki sauce and was just right. The collection of veggies included zucchini, cabbage, and broccoli which were steamed real well as to keep their flavor and health benefits intact. Such a cool little place that feels like your own kitchen ."}
{"text":"Update: The store manager called me regarding my comments left for this location.  He got my voice mail and I called him back and got his voice mail.  It has been several days and I have not heard back from him yet.  So while they made a small attempt to possibly fix the problem, I don't see any real effort going into it."}
{"text":"Outstanding food great service super people.  Excellent value. It was our first visit and we will definitely be coming back a lot."}
{"text":"I came in to order some quick grub and know that they have some decent pricing here! I was helped by Chelsi at the register who kindly took my order and really listened, providing great us timer service! When my food was ready in less than 5 minutes I had another young lady, Mercedes I believe, who gave me my food with a smile and sent me on my way! Great service, speedy waits and satisfying meals! Will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite Asian Style restaurants in Vegas (in the low price range). I have been there 3 times already since we moved to Vegas 3 months ago. They have beef, chicken, vegetables, noodles, and rice.   Their spicy Teriyaki chicken is very popular. The portions are big, except for salad or their mac&cheese. My favorite is their spicy chicken with noodles and vegetables.   I would not eat there more than once a month. But all in all this is a great place to go if you are in the area anyways and hungry for some asian food."}
{"text":"T-mad Chicken Bowl is pretty legit.  I love how they limit their Teriyaki Sauce by drizzling it over the bowl instead of drowning the entire bowl with sauce on it.  Makes me feel like I'm eating a bit healthier.  Get it with brown rice and add veggies.   Good post workout meal if you're on a run and happen to be nearby.   My second visit i tried their Spicy Chicken Bowl and was expecting the ck bowl but a spicier version instead it was just a dried spicy ck bowl similar to Korean Style Chicken.  That was just OK and i left a little dissatisfy.  *tip  If you sub brown rice and add veggies, you can ask for less brown rice and they will put more veggies in there to fill up the bowl at no extra charge."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled to have this Teriyaki Madness in the Hendertucky area.   I get my nails done in the same plaza, and typically get food from T-Madd for dinner on those nights. I almost always take my food to go, but have noticed that this particular location seems to have the cleanest seating area of any that I have been in.   My order is pretty standard, teriyaki chicken breast bowl with extra veggies. I never have to wait long for my food, even if I do not call my order in, and with a gym in the same plaza this spot can get a little busy at times.  Most of the employees I have interacted with appear to be on the younger side, but they are friendly and provide good service. I like that they have teriyaki sauce and sriracha packets easily accessible for to-goo customers.   This location is still fairly new, so I hope the standards remain as high as they are currently.

{"text":"It's been a few months since I said I was done with this specific Teriyaki Madness, and I am happy to be able to do a positive update.   The owner reached out to me after I posted my review and asked me to call him so we could discuss the situation. While I never got around to doing so, it was the fact that he reached out coupled with co-workers reporting positive experiences here that got me to return.  I still call my order in 10-15 minutes before arriving and take my food to go, and it's actually ready when I arrive! Employees seem to be taking their responsibilities more seriously while remaining friendly and welcoming.   Very glad to say this T-Mad is back on the lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"I feel that a review update is needed on this specific Teriyaki Madness. I was recently here and had good food with bad service. I waited a long time for my food and dropped my rating to a 3 because of this.  Since that review, I've been contacted multiple times from the owner of Teriyaki Madness, Dean.  We spent a good 20 minutes talking about the business, but most importantly, what T-MAD was going to do to fix some of the issues.  Let me stress that the owner never asked me to change my review, was never defensive, and never attempted to bribe me.  This is all a good sign from a owner that cares about his customers.  Dean basically explained the cooking process to me, why the katsu taste the way it taste, and why my meal took longer than most.  I actually learned some things from our conversation.    1.  The Katsu here is made out of real chicken breast, not minced pieces of chicken.  Because they're using chicken breast, the batter that's found at Hawaiian restaurants will not stick.  So, T-MAD uses one that's healtier and can stick to chicken breast. In other words, they didn't want to sacrifice health over taste.    2.  I usually order chicken breast with no sauce.  I had no idea that my order would take longer than everyone else because their chicken is marinated. When I order, they assume I didn't want marinade.  So, they would cook a new batch without marinade just for me.  Thus, why my meal took longer than everyone.   3.  I commented that the other T-MAD's tasted better.  He explained some of the possible reasons with one being the new equipment at this location.   4.  I learned that all gym-goers get a discount here.  I never seen this advertised and the employees never mentioned it.  Dean mentioned it though and I will make sure that I'm getting that discount moving forward.  Dean felt that my review was fair and deserving.  He reviewed video of my last visit, addressed the issues with his employees, and even apologized for my recent experience. Bottom line, he recognized me as a regular at most of his locations and wanted to know to know that he valued my opinion about his business. Great job Teriyaki Madness!  You just brought a fan back."}
{"text":"Came in to eat at this location vs the one out by henderson since we were in the area and saw valpak had a mobile device coupon for buy one entree get one free with 2 drink purchase. Valpak even has the option on iphone of adding the coupon to iphone passbook which would only be a mobile coupon you can't print. Ordered presented coupon on phone from mobile app and they said they can't accept it and numerous people have been coming in with that coupon. Good customer service would first of all accepted the coupon they agreed to issue, second have it removed immediately from the mobile valpak add which you use on your phone and don't print and in the mean time post a sign at register identifying problem with not accepting coupon. It's like a retail store almost pulling a bait and switch, if you won't honor something you stop the production of it.  All the sriracha bottles and extra teriyaki soda bottle looking things were also sticky and had dust and dried sauce on the top at every table. Cleaning these would take no time each day but if you can't even honor a coupon you issued or revoke it's existence on the app when you won't honor it why would you keep a bottle clean or dust on top of your soft drink dispenser. The food was decent but you need to customer service aka handling coupon issue appropriately and good food to keep a loyal customer only one won't do it.  I'll be finding a new spot based on the principal of the issue."}
{"text":"Been here about 10+ times in the last year.  Didn't realize that I never reviewed this place. Last visit 8/13/12.   What I've Tried: -Chicken Breast Bowl w/Brown Rice (Extra Meat):  Only when I feel like eating healthier  -Teriyaki Chicken Bowl w/Brown Rice (Extra Meat):  My go to meal  -Orange Chicken w/White Rice: Nothing special, actually prefer Panda Express  -Katsu Chicken w/White Rice:  Stick to a Hawaiian restaurant.   When it comes to taste, I think this place is tastier than Tboy and Samurai Sams. Tboy and Samurai Sams can taste a little bland.  I can't place it, but TMAD definitely taste better.  However, I still find myself going to Samurai Sam's more often since I get a discount."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the same parking lot as 24hr Fitness.  This Teriyaki Madness is perfect for your post workout meal. If you're at the gym and dreading that PWO shake, then this TMAD is perfect for you.  Besides, whole foods is a lot better than shakes anyway.  Trust me, whole foods will bring density to your muscles.    Like all other TMAD's, this one has everything chicken breast. Even their katsu is made out of chicken breast, not minced chicken.  Their teriyaki chicken is flavorful, but I usually opt for their chicken breast by itself, with vegetables, or with brown rice. My most recent visit was with Terri Elite and we shared a chicken breast w/veggies.  The meal was filling and because we didn't have the sauce, it was plain.  But remember, we chose to eat it that way. Want flavor? Have their chicken with the sauce.   I also had the benefit of talking to the owner, Dean, a couple of weeks ago. He's very professional, cares about his business, and most importantly, his customers.  I'm a fan of TMAD's and each location has it's perks. When it comes to taste and service, I still think the location off Craig Road is the best.  When it comes to size of the restaurant, the Centennial location wins.  When it comes to convenience from one of my gyms, this one takes it.    My only issue is that this TMAD is one of their smaller restaurants.  It's a good thing that they weren't too busy when we ate here.  They were also out or didn't have broccoli in stock.    TIP's:   -Gym goers get a discount.  I keep forgetting this.  But still think that the cashiers should ask us, especially when it's obvious that we just came from the gym.  -Order ahead if you're in a rush or if you are requesting brown rice.  -This place also serves salmon"}
{"text":"I've been going to this particular location for 3+ years now, I don't normally write for franchise food joints but this particular teriyaki madness gets props for consistently being good to me.  Service: I've had so many different cashiers throughout the years but all have been friendly, efficient and got my order right.  Never an issue and respect for the hiring and training consistency at this location.  A couple times I've been in a line of 6+, and they got the line out of the way quickly.  Very important to me as I'm allergic to waiting in lines. =)  Food: I always swing by here when I'm fiending Chicken Teriyaki and Rice to pick up and take home.  I'll mix it up with the Spicy or Orange chicken and hit up the pork or beef now and then.  All tasty and the portions are perfect whether I hit up the bowl or a plate combo.  Value: Food is tasty for the prices. If you want cheaper Chicken Teriyaki then Panda Express is your option but you're paying less for overall quality.  Sometimes I'll get Panda, butTeriyaki Madness is definitely an upgrade and worth the extra dollars I'm paying for it.  Ambiance:  If you want to sit and eat, you definitely can.  There's plenty of seating.  However, I'm always ordering to go as I'm always on the go.  Summary: I would like to think I have a reasonable expectation of what to expect when I hit up Teriyaki Madness:  Chicken and Rice combos better than panda as I'm paying a little more, fast and friendly service to get me out the door asap.  This location has been good to me for awhile now and I'm glad they're really close to my house.  Keep up the great work!  Enjoy..."}
{"text":"Good food, good flavor at a reasonable price. I ordered the spicy chicken bowl with noodles and vegetables and I was pleasantly satisfied. Chicken was cooked well and the spice had a good kick to it that wasn't too overpowering. Veggies and noodles had a lot of flavor. All in all the menu isn't too big but everything on it looks delicious. I will definitely be back again and recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick delicious meal."}
{"text":"I love this place! Super good food and and always friendly service.   I love the teriyaki chicken bowls for a quick meal on the go. You can call ahead and just pick it up on your way through. Super convienient and I don't feel super unhealthy about it!    Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Not the best, not very clean. Great service average quality. Good value, however I ordered a plate and I swear I got a bowl..... I'll go back for lunch one day and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Totally cool phone-in system. Every time I call from my cell to place an order for pickup my previous order comes up and they use my name and ask if I'd like the same order! So, in addition to great tasting food, extremely fast service (it is ALWAYS ready when I get there), I also get a personalized and efficient experience. Keep up the amazing work Teriyaki Madness and keep expanding!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a pretty simple menu of meats with the option for white/brown rice and veggies. The food is usually served hot and neatly prepared. No member of the staff has ever been rude to me.  The location has decent seating, but it can get crowded during lunch hours (I guess since it's close to the air force base as well as the armed forces recruitment offices. All in all, a good value for the price....  Primary negative: I do hate that they stopped doing punch cards though :("}
{"text":"First time here. Food was hot and fresh and delicious. Restaurant was very clean. Not the cheapest fast food in town but worth every penny. Well be back for sure."}
{"text":"Thank GOD you guys have moved up into my neighborhood! Love the food here, but now it's even better because I can basically walk to this one! Ate there last night and this food does not disappoint and neither does the service! Get use to seeing our faces!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is slow...every time I go the cashier is somewhere in the back texting and someone has to get her attention  They give you a good amount of chicken with the meals, can customize the meal with veggies if you are health conscious. The crab rangoons are good as well"}
{"text":"They have great simple dishes. The sauces are really solid and the service has been great. You won't hate it."}
{"text":"I love it here everyone's so nice. I just left right now and the cashier was nice and patient. Also our server was so attentive. He asked how we were doing and he even threw away our trash. I love coming here to grab a quick bite before I have to go to class again. The teriyaki chicken is soooo good and I love their veggies. :)"}
{"text":"The girl who works at this place is hilarious!  I wish I would have got her name, but I'll be back.  I'll admit, I'm not a big fan of Teriyaki so I didn't try theirs. That being said their spicy chicken is very good.  Portions are great.  And like others have said, I felt a lot healthier than after eating other places.  And I'm guessing they worked out the kinks others have mentioned.  Go for the food, stay for the service."}
{"text":"Don't don't don't order online will not make any difference.You will walk in and still have to wait 20-30min.I ordered online  waited 40mins then left the house.My order was not even close to being ready. Had to sit and wait I ordered online so I would not have to wait.Great food just online services  SUCK and the wait is to long. And I gave a tip that no one deserves never online never again."}
{"text":"The manager here I forgot her name she's a pretty girl with purple hair is super nice and gives great service. They messed up my order and she was nice and offered to fix it. I would come back here just because I know I will always receive great service and food."}
{"text":"Found this little joint yesterday and had a pretty good meal.  The meat is griled the right way with a little char on the meat.  The spicy chicken had a good level of spice on it, plus you could add more spice with the sauce on the table.  I was surprised that the bowls didn't come with any veggies.  My fault for not reading the menu.  But I was impressed by the selection."}
{"text":"Highly addictive doesn't even begin to describe this place.   I was so glad to see this location open. It's conveniently located right off the 215, on Decatur at the Winco and Target shopping center. The employees are great and inside is always very clean.   I did hear a couple of people complaining because of the wait on the food. Um hello, it's fresh and cooked when you order. Each time I've visited,  I get in and out in no time and the food has been amazing each visit. Plus side to the wait, you can be more specific with the food....no sauce, extra sauce,  sauce on the side, meat cooked longer or not as long. You get the drift, it's worth the wait.     To date,  the food has been on point. Chicken Yakisoba is comparable to some of my favorites around town. Yes it's that good. My go to has been the two proteins plate (available on plate only).  It's obviously the best bang for your buck. I'm sure I'll be back....before the weekend is over."}
{"text":"Love this place, they have the best teriyaki in town.  I always go pick it up and it's usually 10 minutes or less.  Combo plates come with your choice of rice and salads, and they are pretty good on the portion sizes.  I get coupons for this place all the time so I make good use of them.  Love that as soon as I give them my phone number they know my name.  I'm sure it's just a computer thing but it still makes me feel special.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Solid service and freshness, the skinny Hispanic girl at the front always greets me by name. I've always appreciated their expedient service and cleanliness of the facility. Great place to stop by for a protein meal after a gym session across the street!"}
{"text":"Bowls of goodness   I like this place. I don't know how to really review the Madness, as it is what it is. Situated in a small section of strip mall that is accessed off West Lake mead heading east.  Generally always getting the Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice and vegetables, I have never really had real problems with the service and quality of the food here.  I do recommend ordering ahead and walking in and picking up. They are pretty fast serving up!!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and the staff has always been always nice.  The same cashier has rang me up at least 3 previous times and she has been consistently friendly.  I normally order the stir fried yakisoba noodles but today I tried the bowl with spicy chicken, veggies, and noodles as the base.  I also requested all white meat (I didn't know I can do that until the cashier said I could, cool!) I poured the teriyaki sauce over the entire bowl and this gave me a good combination of sweet,spicy, and salty.  I also like how the veggies are cooked, fresh and not soggy or well done.  Usually when ordering a bowl you have too much rice/noodles left over, in this case, I had too much chicken which is not a complaint.  I like this place a lot and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The girl at the front register Haley needs to learn some customer service skills. This was our first visit and definitely will be our last. Very bland and veggies tastes like they were previously frozen instead of fresh. The macaroni salad was very tasteless. Overall just not impressed. Do not waste your money here. Too overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I took spicy chicken plate, very recommended if you like little bit spicy food. I didn't wait more than 10 min and it was ready.  Good place with health food"}
{"text":"Good for a fast, healthier option. The sauce is the best. I wish you could buy it by the bottle to take home. Store sauces just don't compare."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed this visit. I got my food super fast. I asked for extra teriyaki sauce, but there wasn't any in the bag or on the chicken. I could drink that stuff. It's amazing. The place was super clean and in a good location. I would give it another try. I would just stop and put extra sauce on it myself before I left."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch. Rude staff. Slow service. Messed up order.  They made no attempt to make it right!  No one in there was happy."}
{"text":"I went into redeem a birthday coupon for a free teriyaki bowl and showed the cashier the email coupon. He said that they only excepted printed coupons of the email. I went home and checked the email thoroughly again and nowhere in the email does it say that I had to print out the coupon."}
{"text":"Terrible experience !!! Do not order the BEEF !!! When I was served the plate I thought I was in a nightmare, the beef was unappetizing, extremely salty and overall tasteless. It did not take me more than 3 bites to surrender on the plate ... I wish I could put 0 stars for value, taste and presentation. I would definitely not recommend this place 0."}
{"text":"I love the spicy chicken bowl with fried rice! I usually call ahead of time and pick it up. The food takes about 10 minutes or less to make. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the food! Tasty and fresh. I used to get excited about the ice but they went to regular cubes so couldn't give the full five stars."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get the teriyaki chicken breast and chicken katsu plate with brown rice. I personally don't like chicken fat, so I really like how they have the option of ordering all white-meat chicken breast. Their teriyaki sauce is delicious and they there's a whole bottle of sauce at every table. Their Katsu sauce isn't that great but I'll eat it anyway. They have so many healthy food options, so this is a great place for a tasty and nutritious meal. It does take a while to wait for your food (around 5-10 mins), but it's always fresh so I don't mind waiting. The worst part about this place is that it can get pretty pricey (~$10 for a 2-entree plate), plus they charge you extra for brown rice."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service. Noodles were super super dry, gross. Chicken and veggies were good."}
{"text":"I've dined at the Gilbert location for the first time . I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl . And my wife ordered the Katsu and teriyaki chicken . The chicken in both was over cooked and dry . The rice was over cooked as well . The employees were nice and helpful . It's my opinion that maybe the cooks need a little more training . Paid 20.00 dollars for 2 bowls I couldn't eat all of ."}
{"text":"Ended up here since Poke Express is to go only. Easy parking access and killer AC made this fast food joint a relaxing place for lunch.  I went with the double protein combo - beef & chicken teriyaki and stir fried veggies. The portion was large and  the beef tasted marinated - nom nom! Even the veggies were cooked just right and yummy over the steamed rice. BTW they offer a brown rice option.  I'll be returning here for sure."}
{"text":"I was in town on a business trip and decided to give this place a try.  I was extremely surprised at the quality and taste of their food.  Since i was with a group, we decided to order many different items so we could have a bit of everything.    The chicken katsu was awesome with thick slices of white meat chicken with an awesome non-greasy panko breading fried to perfection.  The grilled chicken was tasty with a nice char-grilled flavor.  Gyoza...awesome.  They used the thin sheets of dough to wrap them with as opposed to many other guys who will use the chinese pot sticker wrapper instead which is way too thick and very \"un-Japanese\".  Vegetables--cooked to perfection with a nice crunch to them.    As far as the restaurant itself, very clean, bright colors nice layout with seating outside.    Needless to say, this place is awesome  and i'll definitely be back next time i'm in town."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. To go ordering is quick. I love the spicy yaki soba. Definitely get yourself in the text club offers are pretty good. Lots of bogos! Well worth it! I wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"I love rice bowls anyways!!! They are so quick. I was in and out within 5 minutes and got me a beef teriyaki bowl with veggies!"}
{"text":"Good Food, average service. I love love love the Teriyaki Bowl with Mixed Veggies and white steamed rice.   The service is depending on who you get. I've had a gentleman who has messed my order up several times. I've also had many outstanding orders!"}
{"text":"Great customer service waaaay better the any other location! I love coming to this location and getting greeted by Evelyn is always an awesome experience and when she's not here there is always Alyssa to greet us!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. They have a very simple menu of protein, rice, and vegetable. I choose the large plate with two proteins: spicy chicken, beef, fried rice, and stir fry veggies. I loved the way the chicken tasted and it had a great sear to it. Rice was good but to me rice is rice and if it's not mushy it tastes fine. The beef, ehhh not so great. It was sooo sweat. Yes, I know it's teriyaki beef but it was so sweet it kinda made me cringe when I ate it.   I don't think I would have been to upset that I didn't like it but it was kinda expensive. 3 people ate and the bill was almost $50. The order included: large 2 protein plate, regular bowl, large plate with extra meat, 1 egg roll, 1 crab Rangoon and no drinks. I mean come on for fast food take out that's a bit pricey for what we ordered.    I had a bit of heart burn when I ate and just dismissed it. But when I took my leftovers to work the next day and felt the same way I knew the food didn't agree with me for some reason. I just won't be back to this place."}
{"text":"Well... to start off, the cashier seemed really green... like first day green...  as we started to order, the cashier informs us that it will be at least 30-35 mins to prepare our order of chicken... really??? So we ask for the Teri beef instead... so as we wait there for about 10mins... another person walks out to tell us that they ran out of rice, so they need another 20mins or so... ok, how does this happen? Guess this isn't really fast food... all while, they weren't really busy... and another customer stated he's been waiting for nearly an hour...  at this time, we just got our money back and promptly walked out... Not one worker in there seemed to have any sort of urgency or care for the customers in that lobby that were waiting or disappointed in what could have been a greater experience... none of them cared flat out.  I really wanted to like this place, but 30-60mins for \"something quick\" is a bit ridiculous and so is the customer service ... Ono Hawaiian BBQ never takes this long and always good to their people.."}
{"text":"We always enjoy the food here! This location is always very clean from the table tops, drink area and front counter. The tables are stocked with sauces and condiments, unlike other places where you have to ask for them. The staff is friendly and they walk your order out to you wether to go or dine in. They give you good portion sizes for the price and we easily feed our family of 4 on 2 of the double protein bowls. Clean food without being heavy or greasy. My 7 year old prefers this as a treat over fast food. That works for me."}
{"text":"I Dare you to find a better meal for the price... Impossible!  This is one of those places that quickly becomes a once a week meal for you and the fam.  I like the chicken katsu or Orange chicken but my weapon of choice is the SPICY CHICKEN TERIYAKI BOWL with white rice no veggies.  One of the smartest moves I've made in my adult life is buying a house so close to this place."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. Big portions more than make up for the cost (it's basically two meals for one), super friendly management and staff, and they serve beer and wine!!!!  If you are looking for a quick, reasonably priced, and tasty meal I would recommend swinging through and ordering a bowl.   Ask for the \"Pacoe Special\". It's spicy orange chicken. Very yum."}
{"text":"Staff is real friendly and the spicy chicken is yummmehhhh.  NOMNOM"}
{"text":"I had a teriyaki chicken bowl with noodles and it was good but just had a little too much cabbage in the vegetables it came with.  Their teriyaki sauce itself is awesome though. I also tried their orange chicken and thought it was good. Will definitely be going back to have more of their food in the future!"}
{"text":"Quick healthy fast food (as long as you stay away from the fried food options) at an affordable price. My favorite Is the Spicy Teriyaki Chicken Bowl :) I've been to other Teriyaki Madness locations and I have to say that the food at this location taste better.  Store is clean and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Decided to try this instead of the Five Guys that is right next to us. Was so happy that I did! This was one of the best teriyaki bowls I've ever had. I got the chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies and yakisoba. Literally the best I've ever had. I'm going to continue to go there as much as I can!"}
{"text":"We usually enjoy the food here. However, during this visit they messed up two of our orders and were not willing to correct them. They also messed up the guys order behind us. It's disappointing, the food is good but the service is terrible."}
{"text":"We called in an order for pickup and the food was ready fairly fast. The place was packed for lunchtime with both dine in and take out. I got the spicy chicken bowl and it came with an excellent portion of chicken. Chicken was well cooked and juicy."}
{"text":"Food is good, but I just checked the nutritional content and was horrified. I got the Yakisoba w/chicken. 3400 Mg Sodium (RDA 2300) 1020 Calories 28 grams of Sugar. This is not healthy!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great...service was excellent! Will be eating there regularly."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed that they don't carry gluten free sauce (I'm a celiac), but I don't really expect most businesses to.  What I do like, however, is that I can bring in my own sauce (yes I'm that person ) and they make my food without any sauce so I can eat it! It's reasonably priced, and they understand my need for my own sauce because of my allergies.  Overall, the food is good and it's great for post-gym meals when I don't feel like cooking"}
{"text":"This is now one of my new favorite places to eat.  The food is yummy and the staff has been freindly.  Food is hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but recently they've changed their menu and kinda f threw me off. It's gotten a little more pricey, but that's fine Bc they used to be good with portion. Today I went in and got a two protein bowl, for that they only have one size. It's $10.49 I believe, my protein, veggie AND rice amount was small for something that's suppose to be a large.   Kind of disappointed in the size of my bowl because it looked to be about the same amount of would get for a regular bowl"}
{"text":"Clean establishment, options are yum and prices are fair. Customer service is okay, but it's all good because the food is delicious always!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Tofu Vegetable bowl. Tons of rice and tofu! No vegetables! I had one and a half florets of broccoli, a couple onions slivers, maybe 6 carrot shreds, and some tiny sad pieces of cabbage. I had more zucchini slices than anything, but still very underwhelming.  I feel undernourished.  I can hardly muster up the energy to write this review."}
{"text":"Love the food & service is always fast & courteous. My husband can eat here everyday if I let him. His favorite is the spicy chicken. I like the regular teriyaki chicken with Mac salad. Our food is always hot & fresh & most importantly correct! We never eat in we just take it to go. I never went in there restroom so can't say anything about it. Place is kinda on the small side but at least they have a few tables & chairs outside."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I usually go to the stephanie location cuz its by the timbers i work at and theyre awesome but as a cook i had a feeling as soon as i walked in nobody wanted to be there. Employee sitting out front with an hour til close lounging, cashier didnt greet me or look up until i tipped, cook shot me a stare. Even if the food was perfect the service alone was as if there was no management. I ordered a spicy chicken bowl, egg ROLLS(Only 1), and potstickers. All lukewarm. No way was any of it fresh. I always tip cuz im in the same industry but this is one time i really wish i hadnt.   I told my girl how great TM was and she was pissed at how cold the food was. She is not impressed. She wanted it remade but that cook had the look of something extra might be added..Ill just go to chopstix or china gogo from here on out.   The guy who took my order, and i think rung me up is why they get 1 star. He seemed to be the only one who cared.   I called in my order at 830 and picked it up around 845 on 7/24. Name was preston."}
{"text":"Pretty great food here, had it twice with my SO so far. Last time we had it, the rice was slightly over cooked and a little gummy, but besides that our 4 entrees ordered there so far have been satisfactory!"}
{"text":"this place isn't anything special. I honestly think it's a bit overpriced. anyway I got the spicy chicken. it was decent but not memorable. staff is pretty friendly. I don't think I'll make a point to come back here again. it just doesn't stand out for me."}
{"text":"Great place to eat especially being vegan and having the option of tofu, Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great food!  Tasty fresh chicken and veggies.  I especially like the take home bowls.  I was expecting cheap styrofoam containers.  Instead they were quality plastic clam shells that kept the heat in for the drive home."}
{"text":"We used to eat here at least once a week. About a month ago I got food poisoning from the chicken not being cooked properly. I was hesitant to go back but we thought perhaps it was just the one time it would happen.  I ordered the same dish I always get, grilled chicken breast, to go. Got home started eating and this time I take a bite into the chicken...UNCOOKED AGAIN! Maybe it was just that one piece, nope, every bite of the next 7 pieces was the same. My husbands chicken was the same as mine, uncooked!  I call and ask to speak to the manager and I get some lady who's accent is so heavy she barely understands me. After 5 minutes of going back and forth she says to 'bring food back and they'll cook me another one'. Why should I have to drive ALL the way back because of your mistake? I tell her I am unable to do that. She then tells me she'll call her boss to see if she can do a refund. She calls me back much later and says ok I can come down there to pick up my money....I paid by card...I'm not going to drive down there for the cash when they can void the sale and/or credit the card back. (I know for a fact this is doable because I worked in restaurants from 10+years) I told her I wasn't going to drive down there and just to void or credit the card back. She says OK, no problem.  Fast forward a week...still charged my card. I call and speak to the manager, Robert, and tell him the situation. He proceeds to repeat himself and talk to me like I'm the idiot. He tells me he will give me a discount on the next meal. Are you serious? He says he will not refund my money because I didn't leave the house and bring the food down there. What a piece of work. I ask to speak to his boss and he directs me to the teriyaki madness website. He wouldn't provide me with any phone number. And then he hangs up on me.  Be careful if you eat here. The food quality is SUPER inconsistent. I got food poisoning once and nearly got it again. The manager is rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I was craving teriyaki chicken and my go to spot isn't open on Sundays so I decided to give this place a try since it was open. I ordered pickup and got the teriyaki plate and it is pretty good sized. The chicken is juicy and flavorful and sauce is really good. The white rice was a little on the cooler side, so I had to heat it up a little bit more when I got home. I received an extra sauce in the bag but two extra sauces would've been better for a plate this size. The plate comes with a side and I realized I didn't get the side of macaroni salad I ordered until I got home."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place hits the spot! I wish there was a location near me. Perhaps someday! Their spicy chicken is a must try. Can't wait to come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened.  I don't mind the wait so much as it makes me feel as though my food is fresh. Apparently they recently changed their menu. I ordered a regular sized orange chicken bowl with rice. I think I probably got a single scoop of rice along with a single scoop of chicken. My bowl  was 50% empty.  How much do you get with a small bowl?  Also ordered the crab rangoons. They changed this side as it is no longer a won-ton but looks more like a potsticker. Definitely not worth the price I was willing to pay before the change. I'm so tired of these restaurants changing their menu's and their portion sizes. It's not like they were cheap before. I won't go back unless they do. And if in the off-chance I do, I will check my food for portion size before walking out the door."}
{"text":"It's delicious.  That's really about it.  Like most Teriyaki Madness locations it's located conveniently close to a gym.  Low carb option is awesome.  They'll put the teriyaki sauce on the side and give you salad instead of rice/noodles.  Everything is fresh and not too greasy as opposed to what I recieved from Teriyaki Boy.    Price is reasonable with the exception of the substitution charges.  It seems like everything has a charge such as noodles instead of rice.  I think they even charge for brown rice over white rice.  I don't believe it's on the menu, but spicy beef is where it's at.  I know the spicy chicken is on the menu, I'm not sure about the spicy beef."}
{"text":"The chicken breast in my bowl was rubbery and very tough to chew (making me believe it wasn't all the way cooked) The only good thing about my food was that I did like the flavor of the beef. Also, the potstickers were not bad.   My husband's orange chicken bowl was meh. The chicken was crispy and not at all tasting sweet as orange chicken should.   I'm glad I only paid for one bowl (I had a BOGO coupon) because the food was lackluster at best.   I am giving 2 stars for excellent customer service, speed, and accuracy of service.  Unfortunately, I will not be back."}
{"text":"My Usual: Teriyaki Plate, with noodles and macaroni salad.   It's fast food and super dee duper goonie goo goo good! I LOVE THEIR NOODLES. Their noodles are like ramen noodles but I love that they add garlic powder, I hearts garlic and I'm a sucker for noodles! And I always dip 'em into the Siracha sauce that they've got available on the tables.   \"Best fast food spot for Teriyaki\", says my palette!  The chicken can be a little on the dry side"}
{"text":"Try the spicy teriyaki chicken, it's very delicious. Get their plate since it is bigger than the bowl and not much difference in the price. Friendly staff and pretty quick at serving your food."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE RIPPED ME OFF 100 BUCKS.  STAY AWAY!!!  I went in there ordered dinner paid with 100 dollar bill.  Sat down and instead of getting my dinner and change Igot a fake 100 bill and a fairy tale saying the fake bill was what I had paid with.  Fantastic lies and theft by the Teriyaki cashier thief woman.  Forget this place.  Then she says shes doing me a favor by giving me the fake 100 bill.  I couldn't believe it and i still don't believe it."}
{"text":"We love going to this location as the service is so much better. They're more caring & they make sure that your order is what you exactly wanted. My son loves Chicken Katsu & I love the spicy & vegetables. I recommend to get the Chicken breast teriyaki. It's so delicious & healthy."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE the spicy chicken bowl here. We could eat this clean low calorie food every single day. The chicken thigh pieces are a combination of crispy, salty and sweet on a bed of sticky brown rice and a side of perfectly steamed crunchy broccoli. Yum"}
{"text":"Quick and good customer service. But didn't care for the chicken. Very over cooked and minimal flavor. Large portions but just didn't like the taste"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since they opened and just experience the WORST food and service ever! I ordered chicken egg rolls and after waiting over 10 minutes for them (no surprise) they came out burnt to a crisp. So I returned them right away. Instead of getting a \"I'm sorry about that ma'am\" I received a \"They look burnt but they aren't burnt. I eat them this way all the time!\" I told him well I couldn't even bite through it! On top of the fact that I eat here all the time and have never received them or eaten them this way. So I asked for a new batch to be made. Which came out exactly in the same condition. I hate to let one bad set of cooks and employees determine if I eat here again however, I will no longer be eating here. You would think they would treat their ONE CUSTOMER better!!!"}
{"text":"I live in the northwest and normally go to the T-mad in centennial, or lake mead, but this one is way better.  The vegetables were well executed, the spicy chicken and rice were coked perfectly."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place as they just opened, I checked yelp to find out what their hours were and it said 10pm. when we got there there was a sign on the door saying they close tonight at 9. Since we arrived at 8:50 we rushed inside to catch them before they closed,  but their registers were already shut down,  mind you i understand wanting to close and get out, but if thats the case,  close when your sign says so... be accurate and don't close before that posted time! And DON'T say smart comments as your customers are walking out! As I turned around to ask what was said, i didnt get an apology. This is NOT how you treat people who spend money with your business! Highly disappointed!"}
{"text":"Took the boys to their favorite spot to eat . I ordered a large orange chicken bowl with half rice , half noodles with a side of broccoli for them. Between both of them they nearly finished the whole thing. We absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"I am a loyal regular customer of the centenial location. The food is great and always made fresh, the wait staff are always courtious and profesional, aswell as very knowledgable about the menu. The tables are always clean, and bathrooms are always clean and smell like they have just been cleaned, which is good in my opinion, it shows the employees are dedicated to there jobs. I know I can always go there and relax and eat my favorite meal. Which by the way is orange chicken and teriaki chicken with noodles and white rice, its so yummy and great tasting. Also the prices are very reasonable and portions are much more than other places I have gone to. So if your thinking about trying tmad, go to centenial location and you wont be disapointed, tmad is the best."}
{"text":"Very flavorful meat, haven't found a place like this since I've moved out from California and this hits home."}
{"text":"The food and the service here are terrible. The idiot cashier that took my order had a terrible attitude and nasty hygiene. As she was taking my order she kept coughing and hacking into her hands. All of the other employees, including the cooks, were clowning around and cracking jokes. This is probably why the food was trash as well. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Teriyaki madness is the best restaurant out there but that was my opinion yes they may be busy  at sometimes or all the times but it's worth it it is very good so thanks teriyaki madness"}
{"text":"I must admit I HATE most Teriyaki sauces, they always seem so sweet but the Teriyaki sauce here is PERFECTION! The wait wasn't long at all and the food is amazing! I ordered the white rice and spicy chicken bowl. 260 calories   I promise you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki chicken and teriyaki beef with noodles and salad for about 11 bucks. the teriyaki sauce was burnt onto the beef, and the noodles and a burnt eriyaki type flavor. In retrospect I should have ordered no sauce on anything, but that's why you go to teriyaki madness right? I will not be ordering there for quite a while."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always great and ready fast. The employes are all american and speak English and the restaurant is clean and bright, a lot different from the teriyaki joints I'm used to.   I usually call in my order and it it always ready by the time I arrive to pick it up. Wish they had a bigger beverage selection."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be and prices have been raised. This will be a seasonal treat vs. a regular stop.  You get a decent amount of filler aka rice."}
{"text":"Update:  I was contacted by the owner, who offered a replacement or refund.  This time around was delicious!  Perfect, healthy lunch. Lady at counter was very nice and got my order just right. Now I see why this place is packed.  Thanks for turning it around Mr. Owner   Love Asian food, but got the chicken breast bowl and it was not cooked all the way.  When I told the cashier, she acted unaffected and explained to me that is how chicken breast is. Not cooked all the way through? Ok. Tried it out and will not be coming back.  Beware."}
{"text":"So check it out! My wife does not love Asian inspired style foods! I have been hitting up this spot on my lunch breaks for a few weeks now. Well my wife wanted to try something new for a quick dinner. My wife is usually a picky eater, so I was a bit surprised when she wanted to try Teriyaki Madness. She usually will eat fried rice and some sort of Orange style chicken.   Well my wife did, she ordered the Orange Chicken plate, with fried rice, and stir-fry veggies. We also orders the Edamame, and my usual the Spicy Chicken Teriyaki plate, on White rice, with the Stir-Fry veggies.  We took the order to go and my wife starts in one the Edamame. She loved them and the entire order was gone before we got home. (I got none... Seriously)  Well we get home and she starts in on her fried rice, she clams to date, in her 27 years on this earth, that their fried rice was the best she has ever eaten!  She claimed better than the fancy Japanese places, better than panda, better than any fried rice she has eaten!  She loved the veggies with the dish, and thought the Orange Chicken was good, but could have used some more sauce. My wife said \"We will never eat at panda again\" the fried rice changed her life.   I always love their spicy chicken teriyaki, it has the right amount of spice, and don't leave my moth on fire. I do love spicy food so my tolerance is a bit more than most.   Teriyaki Madness has our business and we are here to stay!! 5 stars good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"There is a warning as you walk in the door and it is true!  This food IS highly addicting. The customer service is very good and the restaurant is clean. They are quick, nice serving size and reasonably priced. I had the teriyaki chicken bowl with noodles and stir-fried veggies, and my hubby had the teriyaki beef. We sampled the orange chicken and crab ragoons as well.   The food is fantastic. The chicken and beef were very tender and the flavor of the food is outstanding. They have very delicious teriyaki and orange sauces. The crab ragoons are stuffed full of the cream cheese mix and delicious. It is served with a sweet sauce that compliments it very well.   We are very pleased and excited to have found yet another local favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious food......! I had Spicy chicken Teriyaki and fried rice and I loved it with sriracha and teriyaki sauces"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time food is always excellent. But to show up 30 minutes before closing and be told your 'out of food' is a load of BS! It just amounts to being Sunday and they want to go home early. Guess I'll find somewhere else to eat for now on that won't tell me their 'out of food' a half hour before closing."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  From LA and needed good food for my kids.  The guy (think he might have been the owner) was real accommodating and made sure we were taken care of.  Definitely coming back next time we stop by.  Ingredients were fresh and food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Crab Rangoon had almost no cream cheese and tasted like it had sat in old grease i asked for noodles instead of stir fry vegetables but got vegetables.  The egg roll was cold as was the orange chicken and teriyaki beef the rice was flavorless mush. Total disappointment overpriced yuck.  4.99 for 4 small crappy cream cheese (less) crab Rangoon's"}
{"text":"20 mins before closed told me they wouldnt make me a chicken bowl because didn't have any chicken already cooked and needed to clean up"}
{"text":"Update:   Randy, the owner of this store, called me and immediately offered to correct the situation.  His attention was truly appreciated.  He welcomed us back to his store and we were very pleased with the exceptional attention we were given. Thank you, Randy!  The spicy chicken is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Love their spicy chicken and noodles.  Quick and convenient.  Nice sized meals."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is fast. They are friendly. I just placed a to go order , 2 exits away on the freeway by the time I got there, my food was ready to go. Excellent service.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place and try to get here once a week. Dinning area is spacious and kept clean. Staff is always friendly and have smiles on their faces. Food is prepared fresh to order, the flavors are great, the portions are good and price isn't bad. My personal favorite is the spicy chicken plate with brown rice and green salad."}
{"text":"4.75 stars. Quick in and out. Build your bowl with a variety of proteins and carbs. Different types of rice and fried noodles. Fresh mixed veggies. Outdoor seating. If they had  more different types of veggie selections/preparations and perhaps some toppers like peanuts or sesame seeds, that would make it a strong 5 star for me. Price, though, can't be beat.  Enough to fill you up. Teriyaki sauce too sweet for this sourpuss, so I will order the other sauces to try.  So glad I grabbed the soy sauce and sriracha packets to tweak my sauce.  Friendly service. Easy parking."}
{"text":"I must say I was anti madness for a little bit but yesterday completely blew me away. The associate named Shay has made me do a 360 on my views of this place. I called ahead to place my order and she was courteous over the phone and fast. When I arrived to pick up my food she greeted not only myself but everyone with a smile. My order was ready when I got to the counter and she obliged me when I asked for extra teriyaki sauce and even went out of her way to get me chile sauce . Very sweet young lady and her customer service skills are GREAT and to top it off my spicy teriyaki bowl was delicious! I will definitely be coming back to this establishment in the near future."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and I forgot how good this place was! I got the spicy chicken teriyaki with white rice and it was so so so good! The staff was friendly and really helps you with pairing your food with different choices and sides."}
{"text":"Seriously guys, get it together!  Every single time we order delivery from here we are missing an entree. This time the driver caught the missing rice bowl,  and when he told you, you put another one in the bag. But there's one problem--you gave me something entirely different than what I had ordered. I ordered two spicy chicken bowls with brown rice, but instead got one correct bowl and then a spicy chicken plate with noodles and a spontaneous egg roll thrown in. My kids orange chicken with no veggies came with extra veggies. Not that he couldn't use them, but still, it wasn't my order. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have always been a fan of TMad, the staff is very friendly and helpful and most importantly the food is always fresh and hot! This location on 215 and N. Decatur is close to the house and I go there frequently and every time me and my family walk away satisfied! recommend the Spicy Chicken bowl, the Mac Salad is Awesome too!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this type of food and equally loved this place!  We enjoyed being able to customize our order/flavors and it was delicious.  Food came out quick and the team was friendly.  We will be back :)"}
{"text":"I was impressed by how fast I got my food. The staff was not too professional, but I did not expect much more. Food was okay, they give a huge amount of rice and broccoli and like a quarter of a chicken breast. So, for the price, it's not that great of a deal, because we all know how cheap rice is. Probably will be back based on the convenience of it and location."}
{"text":"A good option for a quick, inexpensive meal that can be on the healthy side. The location is in a quiet shopping center so it's easy to access and find parking.  The cashier at the front greeted us right away, took our orders accurately, and our food came out quickly. The inside of the restaurant was a little cramped, but clean. I loved that the menu board gave calorie ranges to help with making good choices.  I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. The rice and vegetables were good. I liked the flavor of the chicken and the quality was as expected for the price. The sauce that came with the bowl was good. The portion was more than enough to fill me up. My husband ordered Chicken Katsu and enjoyed his meal.  I'll keep this in my list of quick, lower calorie meal options."}
{"text":"Great protein for after the gym. I call and order food while I am at 24 hour fitness next door and it is ready when I get there. On this plan, I've put on a ton of muscle. Get the spicy chicken and beef combo with brown rice. Also, their edamame is great."}
{"text":"Five stars because its fresh, affordable and the portions are huge. If you like Flame Broiler, you'll love this place. It's as good as Waba Grill. The veggies are stir fried and their menu has a little more variety. I'm glad I tracked this place down. I'll be back whenever I hit Vegas."}
{"text":"I like the food here, good classic teriyaki yeah, service is good, even when busy.  The only complaint I have is that this place needs to be cleaned.  The floors are very sticky, tables need to be cleaned better, and get some form of fly control, they are always buzzing around."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered in but twice was my second time and I was pleasantly pleased. My go to is the spicy chicken bowl with veggies only and extra chicken. Staff is fast and friendly. No complaints!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome it's been across the street from my work forever but I didn't even know about it til like a month ago. The only thing is this place isn't cheap! I say only come if you're really craving it, it's be cool if there were coupons or sticker cards for regular customers. I always order the spicey chicken bowl. Makes me feel like a winner :)"}
{"text":"I've always liked grabbing an easy, healthy choice bite here. Spicy Chicken with brown rice. Fast, satisfying and a good value. Don't forget the extra teriyaki sauce.  I'm writing this because my question was removed regarding the strange tasting fountain soda. It is my sincere hope TM will address this now that I've written a review. The soda from the machine tastes noticeably OFF..like the soda lines weren't cleaned properly or issues with poor filtration in the ice. I've noticed this location has occasional problems with a strange drainage-like smell. Maybe it's in the water, too? I really do hope they can fix this problem as I like the convenience of coming to this location."}
{"text":"Please understand that my teriyaki bar is set pretty high, as I'm originally from Hawai'i.   I opted for chicken katsu, because I haven't had it in so long. The breading definitely wasn't panko, and it was overcooked, so the chicken was a dry and lacking much flavor. The katsu sauce just tasted off. Sort of tasted like mild BBQ sauce with a dash of cinnamon - very strange. The rice and veggies had very little flavor also. What made it all taste good were the few slivers of onion in the veggies and the little bit of teriyaki sauce I also received.  As I was writing this review, I realized my flavor experience was more akin to 2/5 stars instead of 3 - and I rarely give out 2 stars. Sorry, guys. You missed the mark."}
{"text":"Ive visited three times and the food is good.  My only complaint is that I wish the price was more affordable. Maybe offer certain bowls/plates at a discount each day of the week. Also be careful of upgrading options because unless you are doing the math in your head it adds up very quickly. I spent $30 on 2 adult bowls and 1 kid bowl. No drinks or egg rolls on the adult bowls and even opted out the rice for more veggies. For that price you could eat at the Chinese place across the street and leave a tip. However, it's good food and a fresh option. The plates are HUGE so we just get the bowls now"}
{"text":"I'm entering this joint hungry as a Yelp'ah!  So it's my first time here and little did i know that this was one of those healthy eating fast food restaurants. My comrades didnt  give me any info what-so-ever on the way over. Learning the hard way, I decided on the Chicken Katsu to compare to L&L's. Crispy and juicy it was, but didnt have the hunger satisfaction flavor I had came hungry for.. and yes, that was with the dipping sauce! In my opinion, the rice tasted better. Lol  Okay so i wasn't all that satisfied. As for my next visit, I hope to choose another entree worth my while whenever the the Airmen feel Yaki!"}
{"text":"Ho hum.  Nothing special here.  Rice wasn't cooked long enough.   Nobody likes dry crunchy rice.  Chicken was boring.  I would not come back again.  Go to Zoe's."}
{"text":"What a great 1st experience.  We just moved here from California and love teriyaki joints like Waba Grill, and we were hoping to find something similar here in Vegas. Well we got a flyer in the mail for a buy 1 get 1, so we decided to come in and try Teriyaki Madness.  My first impression was that it was a little trendy looking, which isn't necessarily bad. I also noticed that there were quite a few people in there for it being a Wednesday. The place looked clean and staff looked friendly.   We were greeted by Yuliana (Julie) who was super friendly. I told her it was our 1st time at Teriyaki Madness, and she offered to answer any questions we may have. She was super attentive and definitely paid attention, so I didn't have to repeat any part of my order. She was great.   The food was really good. A lottttt of rice, but only  an average serving of meat. Great amount of veggies. The teriyaki beef was my favorite from the 3 meats I tried. The other 2 I tried were chicken teriyaki and chicken Katsu. Both good, but the beef was amazing.   I give the food 4 stars and the friendly service from Julie 5 stars. We will be back once we get another coupon. :)"}
{"text":"Its ok,  expensive for for what it is. Very salty ...  service is always great and the place is clean."}
{"text":"My only complaint was that there was not enough sauce. The quality was good, but I barely got any teriyaki sauce on my teriyaki chicken! It would have been nice to have enough sauce for my chicken as well as the vegetables and noodles."}
{"text":"The wait in line was short (yea!). Daisy at the register was pleasant, efficient, and wonderful (yea!). The restaurant was comfortable and clean (yea!). Why only 2 stars? Well, I get chicken yakisoba and it was pretty terrible! Bland! I even added a load of their \"thin sauce\". The chicken pieces where chopped into very small bits and hard to stab with my fork. Finally, the veggies were under-cooked (nearly raw). I forgot to ask my friend's opinion so I may update later."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their bowls. I know that whatever I get is not gonna break the bank or my diet. I like how strategically they put these near gyms, which works out perfect if you're trying to fuel up post-workout and you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Delicious Teriyaki Chicken.  I get the TM bowl and I'm set.  Everything is made fresh and your chicken comes w rice.  The rice is made fresh and cooked perfect.  Just a tummy little place."}
{"text":"I wish i hadn't gone vegan recently for the sole reason that i can no longer eat the spicy breast plate i love so much! I dream about it still!!! Lol. Best teriyaki for sure. I recommend spicy though because the regular teriyaki lacks much flavor but the spicy sauce (extra spicy if ya nasty!) Is soooooo good. Now when I come here again (which I will) I'll have to get the mixed veggies extra spicy with rice. But Damn I miss that chicken. Only docked one star due to the fact that a few times when I ordered spicy and got regular it wasn't all that."}
{"text":"Great Favor! Just got off the plane from Chicago and wanted something simple but good. This place hit the spot!!! Spicy Chicken was perfect with bursting favors. I will be coming back my next time back! Great service!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new restaurant. It is a walkup order set up, so it is very easy to ask questions about the menu and get suggestions. I like that it is made to order and I got to personalize the veggies; however, I was with my family and we waited an extremely long time to get our food. I get that it is new and that it is made to order, but it was an abnormally long time to wait for food at this type of location. We were given coupons to come back and get buy 2 get one free for our wait though. Also, you get a discount off of your meal when it is your first time visiting. I think as they get more established it'll work out the kinks in operations. I enjoyed my meal. I got the teriyaki chicken bowl with noodles and veggies. My family also got bowls and the portion is plenty even to have some leftovers. I noticed that the veggies weren't consistent between everyone's bowls (some had more broccoli, others had a lot of carrots, etc.). I love that it isn't over sauced so that you can add the sauce to taste. I'll go back maybe when it's a little more established."}
{"text":"i love this place and i come here all the time. the food never fails to please. however i have come in 2 times at 9:30pm and they have sent me out because they are \"closed\". where i work i am required to stay open 10-20 minutes after the time we actually close to serve any customers who come late. it's upsetting that you guys can't do that and are just lazy. you're really losing customers and sales that way. just stay open and serve food until you actually close, if you wanted to close at 9:30, change your closing times."}
{"text":"I don't care how average the food is when you hand me my receipt to sign and give back and I put a 20% tip for TAKING MY ORDER and nothing else and you watch me do it...a simple THANK YOU would be appreciated. Plenty of people that would appreciate that job and probably deserve it more than the rude young girls they have working here. Maybe get off your phones and pay attention to what the customers saying and you won't screw up a simple order.   /rant"}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff is super friendly and helpful! Warning, food is highly addictive"}
{"text":"Service is great and the food is fresh and delicious! I get spicy chicken well done and it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that this Teriyaki Madness location is lacking customer service because they make a dang good Teriyaki Bowl! I came in the other day about 10 minutes after it opened and the lady in the front manning the cash register looked absolutely miserable. She was extremely unwelcoming and couldn't have been more monotone. I've given this location three tries now and have experienced the same service."}
{"text":"4 Stars Baby. I have now been here twice and I am a fan! This place is a great little find but easily missed due to a tucked away location... Just look for the obnoxious Taco Bell and it is right behind it ;)  I think I am addicted to the \"Spicy Chicken\" on Brown Rice! My wife also loves their Chicken Teriyaki with Veggies. The food is super fresh and somewhat of a very basic menu. It isn't authentic Asian cuisine, but I will not go to Panda anymore if this is an option!  The restaurant is very clean and has a sports bar feel to it. NFL banners and Rock n' Roll posters are on display and they have a big HD TV for the games...   The service is always friendly and very speedy! All in all, we will be repeat customers and if you are in the area, check it out...  Cheers"}
{"text":"I got the Orange chicken, fried rice and macaroni chicken. It was really good, they took long for the order, but it was worth it. Just a tad bit better than Panda Express. \"Panda, panda, panda\""}
{"text":"I don't get the great reviews.   The bowls with mixed vegetables consisted of undercooked cabbage and overcooked zucchini.    I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I enjoy the teriyaki chicken dinner plate at least once a week. I call ahead to pick up my order. Always fast, fresh and delicious!  Pot stickers are worth giving a try too."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service.  Call ahead and place your order because they do get busy."}
{"text":"Madness is right! This place on Craig Rd is crazy! Crazy good food and crazy employees! I love going here once a month or so! Would go more often but that would totally kill my diet! The beef teriyaki bowl is my personal favorite, but my kids like the plates too. The salad is good and the veggies are quite tasty! I like the atmosphere. It's a little cozy in there and its loud. SO it works great for carry out...not so much if you want to eat in. The setup is much more communal and that doesn't work for everyone. I wouldn't mind that so much if there were more room or the noise level was knocked down a couple of decibels! Another reviewer commented on how they always know your order or seem to. I agree, I like being called by my first name and I don't mind the casual banter and a good ribbing. The staff all seem good natured! I almost got put to work the last time I went in....LOL! Pretty fun place to hang out for a bit. Although you never have to wait very long for the food. I think the comment on quantity of food may stem from the days when they used styrofoam containers. When I first started going there the food came in large styrofoam containers, then at some point they switched to the plastic take out containers! Much better, but the QUANTITY did go down! QUALITY is never an issue! I always eat more than I should! TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS! They should go check out the MADNESS! And sign up for their texts,....they have a club that sends out specials!"}
{"text":"I get take out from here at least once a week. Love the spicy chicken plate low carb style, always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Tonight we were feeling like Asian food and used Uber Eats to order from this restaurant.  Wow, happy to report this was awesome good. Great quality and big portions.  We'll definitely  have this again!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but seems to always be messed up when I get home. They can never get my order correct. Employees that help are rude. Not really worth the hassle of going back."}
{"text":"I've been to this teriyaki madness twice now but its been here for years.   I just kind if discovered recently that I liked this chain so I didn't get around to visiting this one until recently.  This one is definitely smaller than the other ones I've been to but my parents live down the street so both times Ive gotten to-go. The food is the same here as the other ones. Awesome.  As of yet, I haven't had to wait longer than 5 - 7 minutes to get my food out to me.   As for the complaints on service, they seem to be directed mostly by the fact that there's no public restroom but that's not the fault of the employees.   As for their demeanors, most if them are my age or younger, at the counter, so they're not rude, they're just young so they're probably not going to make a lot of small talk. What they are, however, is extremely efficient, and helpful. If you have a question, it has an answer.   I like this place quite a bit and I'll def be coming back."}
{"text":"1 star for this location!  Usually we go to the Lake Mead and Buffalo location (SO MUCH BETTER).  But we got a 20% of coupon in the mail and decided to drive the extra mile.  Big mistake!  The staff was rude, the store was filthy and the food was Horrible.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place understands customer service and great food. It was my first time here, and the employee Byron, was so kind and helpful. Byron suggested the best dishes and even gave my mom and I free drinks since it was our first time! How sweet right? Byron mentioned how great the chow-mein was, and all my life I wasn't a big fan of any noodles BUT their chow-mein is DELICIOUS! Oh, and the chicken is awesome! I will definitely be back! Thank you for the food and outstanding customer service Byron!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The spicy chicken is great, has a nice kick to it, but not overpowering. after eating a whole meal of it, you will have a nice warm burn in your mouth. All is great, but what is funny is Id have to say, some of the worst katsu chicken I have ever had in my life, just avoid that."}
{"text":"Great food, great costumer service. The workers r always happy to see you when you come back. They remember who you are and are super friendly every time."}
{"text":"Finally got to go to this place after moving into the neighborhood about a year ago and was very disappointed. I wish I could say it was the food but my wife and I never got the chance. After standing in line for a while we get to the front and place our order. That's when we were told \"cash only\". We only had our debit cards on us. When I asked if they could put a sign up so customers know that before wasting time the cashier told me \"not my problem\".  Don't be back here."}
{"text":"obsessed with the spicy chicken bowl. I am always won over with good rice & fresh veggies. My kid loved his meal too."}
{"text":"This place is a straightforward concept of fresh beef or chicken teriyaki bowls with rice or noodles. It is a great spot for a post workout meal. I'm sure many people eat here after their workouts because it's right beside an EOS.  My favorite bowl is the spicy chicken noodle bowl. Sprinkle some sriracha on there to top it off!"}
{"text":"So delish! The have several sizes to appeal to everyone appetite. They have a program to sign up for for pretty good coupons they email to you. They are able to customize your meal of you don't want a certain type of vegi. Also the spicy option is good not that spicy, just a little zing! We live it and get food at least once a week from there"}
{"text":"I really like this location. It's very clean and the employees are very pleasant and helpful. The serving sizes are perfect maybe even too much but good enough for lunch the next day. The food is always fresh and vegetables too! The food is prepped just right and tender. Sign up for their deals!"}
{"text":"By far the worst service ! They don't know how to communicate with each other and get pissed of at customers as if it's our fault we didn't get what we ordered. The Asian dude with the grey shirt is a jerk!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this one star because of how poorly the service was and how cold my food was having to wait over an hour even after I ordered through the app to give them more than enough time to prepare the food by the time I arrived. Once I got there half the order was missing, and two orders were incorrect I had to wait another hour just for them to prepare the meal and they didn't even bother to check on me to at least let me know they're still working on the food. If I didn't prepay the order I would have already left the place and not bother with them. The employees working there seemed young and distracted and needs more training on customer service. You can tell I wasn't the only one who trying to wait for their food there was a long line of customers before me and even one person said someone else received their order before them even though they were there first 30 minutes beforehand. There definitely needs to be better communication amongst them in order for them to service customers properly."}
{"text":"New owners have completely changed this place!! Food was very good and came out in a timely manner.  Everything looks remarkably cleaner and service was perfect."}
{"text":"I found this place enjoyable. Food was hot and fresh, also reasonably priced for entrees and plates. I've gotten my food both take out and have dined in. Similar experience with both. Can get a bit pricey for what it's worth if getting sides and drinks. Entrees are solid, worth a try if you're in  the area."}
{"text":"Not again.  Thought we would try something new but just extremely dissatisfied with both meals.  Fried rice was essentially regular steamed rice with some components of fried rice;  the steamed rice in my wife's order was hard as a rock.  Steak was extremely over cooked and dry and the chicken (spicy) was bland.  The only part remotely decent was the chicken katsu.  Sorry won't be here again."}
{"text":"I can always go hear after the gym and get my spicy chicken bowl with brown rice! YUM. Great Service and BOMB food!"}
{"text":"Best chicken bowls in town! Love the spicy chicken as it is always hot and fresh. We also take home the bowls and use them to take lunch to work... free tupperware!!!"}
{"text":"First time checking out this location for a food run for work, I've always usually gone to the Centennial location. Pretty much the same as the other locations. The food was really fresh, my only complaint would be that one of the chicken teriyaki bowls was over cooked. Would definitely check back."}
{"text":"We ordered beef teriyaki plate and pork teriyaki plate. Both came with 2 scoops of white rice each and mini iceberg lettuce salad. Total bill was $16.30.  This is one of those places you go to if you live nearby. Not worth driving to, particularly at these prices.  The meat was super-thin slices chopped, sauteed, and drenched in teriyaki sauce.  The sauce was heavy on the soy, so you definitely need to mix in the rice with each bite.  The food is edible, but overpriced for what it is. If each plate was $5 or less they would get more business."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area this week and I was looking for a place that would be good enough to make me and my girlfriend regulars.  This one was very close to us, and the menu looked good, so we gave it a shot.  It's a little difficult to find, as Google Maps puts it on the wrong intersection.  But, if you're not as map-deficient as I am, it shouldn't be too difficult (it's right near the Taco Bell).    I got the Chicken Teriyaki plate with the macaroni salad.  I was expecting a LOT of food since the website says the portions are generous.  The macaroni salad, however, was in a very tiny cup - prior to opening it, in fact, I mistook it for soy sauce or teriyaki sauce.    Quality of food was good, but was not exceptional, either.  The chicken was well-prepared.  The rice was a bit dry on the outside, but sticky in the middle, as if it had been sitting for a while.  I'll probably go again, just because it's so close.  But, my search for a good chicken teriyaki will definitely continue.  Also, just an FYI, the profile on Yelp says they deliver, but they do not."}
{"text":"Finally, stopped in late Sunday afternoon,Great food, nice portions, at a good price along with fast & friendly service.  TV for watching football, etc.  Spicy Chicken Teriyaki bowl is a winner...comes with cabbage, zucchini, carrots, and broccoli...can get all or only some.  I went with cabbage and broccoli, skipping the zucchini and carrots. Will repeat often, for sure."}
{"text":"It's definitely madness. Teriyaki's good, veggies were super fresh.. But the atmosphere and vibe just didn't sit well with me. A little too pretentious with their iPad cash registers and their (I feel super fake decorations). If they had a drive thru, then I would eat there again... But they don't."}
{"text":"Second time eating here with my boyfriend. I ordered the spicy chicken plate with brown rice and a side of macaroni salad. Boyfriend got the Katsu bowl with white rice and vegetables. We also got 1 fountain drink. Total came out to $19.97.  The food was good but the workers seemed rude. No smile or a welcome = 1 less star!    I would highly recommend the spicy chicken teriyaki. Flavor with every bite and just the right amount of spiciness!"}
{"text":"This place is just an average teriyaki place Had the combo the chicken was ok a bit on the dry side The beef was the same a little dry with not much flavor Kinda of disappointment Down the street at Yogis is the bomb beef teriyaki The decor was nice Wasnt terrible but wasnt the greatest I dont think ill be back or maybe i should try something else"}
{"text":"Always hot fresh and satisfying!  Favorite fast food.  Clean restaurant in  White/Red and Black decor.  Constantly greeted by friendly staff who bring your meal to your table. Outdoor seating is charming.    I can always count on the quality of the food."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Ordered teriyaki chicken breast bowl.  Probably one of the worst dining experiences ever.  Chicken tasted as though it had been cooked days ago and only reheated in the microwave and served with a squirt of teriyaki sauce.  Brown rice was mushy and tasteless.  As for the chicken. Don't get me started.  The place was pretty slow as we were the only customers in the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"customer service when ordering was terrible, I ordered the chicken breast terriyaki, and it was very dry and bland.  I wanted macaroni salad and they didn't have it, I couldn't figure out why cause the person taking my order lacked communication skills."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, I'll never eat at this location again. Driest food I have ever had. The entire thing was just a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Dirty dirty dirty. Went here because the Gilbert location is temporarily closed and expected the same experience. After finishing my dry, burnt teriyaki plate I went inside the restroom and at first glance it was clean but the floors were sticky gross with god knows what. Went out and looked at drinking fountain and it was dusty and coated with? Took a glance at the kitchen and the floors looked like they haven't been swept in days. Everything from their windows to floors were a mess and I can only imagine how the back kitchen is treated. Went home and had stomach issues. Wish I took pictures to save someone a trip or management can step in."}
{"text":"Sooo good most days. I go here at least twice a week. I love their sauce. Just wish the quality of chicken was consistent. Too often I get dry burnt chicken but when they get it right, it's addicting."}
{"text":"I love the spicy chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies. The chicken has amazing flavor with a little kick and the brown rice is some of the best I have had. This dish is extremely healthy yet full of flavor. Also, a good sized portion for the cost."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. Got the orange chicken and noodles, much better than your Panda Express's and little Asian restaurants orange chicken. Got my order to go and they forgot my macaroni salad, other than that everything was excellent. I live near by and will go back."}
{"text":"If you live in the area and you're craving for Asian food but don't really feel like eating Panda's or Chinese fast food, Teriyaki Madness is the one for you! Definitely a great alternative to some of the other restaurants in the area.  If you're just hungry, and not super hungry, a bowl will fill you right up. I usually get a teriyaki bowl with white rice and veggies and I am always satisfied."}
{"text":"The reason for the two star is the food is usually good. On the other hand, the cashier working tonight when we visited at about 7:20 acts like its a problem taking your order. When my boyfriend paid with his credit card and she looked at the receipt noticed he didn't tip, her attitude got worse. We stood there waiting for our cups and she looked at us and asked \"can I help you?\" in a nasty tone, then she turned around to get the cups like it was a problem. We did notice she never greeted anyone that came in or say \"thank you\" at the end of the sale. She makes you feel you never want to go back,  which is not good for your business. We visit this location often and always had warm welcomes from the other cashiers."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a quick take out fix. The food and service is always consistent. The staff is friendly. Great terri beef and chicken. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The facilities are really nice and well kept. The food was amazing! I got the spicy teriyaki chicken. It was grilled to perfection. Every table has a bottle of sriracha, teriyaki sauce, and soy sauce. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"So dam good I think this locwtion is the best one I've tryed so far ... macoroni ks killer good and so dam refreshing as a side dish match made in heaven !!!! Spicy beef suxka !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and was pretty disappointed. I ordered a chicken katsu bowl and got thick pieces of tough pork breaded like chicken katsu . Not worth the time going back to get it right."}
{"text":"I used to say this was my favorite rest in Vegas. Now it is just ok.  The Spicy Chicken plate is great, but it seems like the portions have been cut in half. I used to be able to make 2 meals off one plate...Not any more.  They also nickel and dime you for extra sauce, rice or noodle substitutions. I would have given this rest a 5 back in 2008. Now only a 3...AVERAGE"}
{"text":"Super tasty place! Large portions as well. I ordered brown rice with both spicy chicken and salmon teriyaki. The salmon was cooked and flavored perfectly. Same goes for the chicken- not too spicy but great flavor achieved. The sautéed veggies includes cabbage, broccoli, onion, zucchini and carrots and is awesome!!! You'll spend between $8-$12 for a great meal!"}
{"text":"They did a much better job this time. My food came out relatively quick and it was nice and hot. The spicy chicken has good flavor, but for me at least, it's not very spicy. As I said in my tip, they are charging $1.99 for a 16.9 oz bottle of Kirkland(Costco) water that goes for $0.10 per bottle. I'm not against profit and capitalism, but I just can't justify spending that much for this product.   For those of you that are going to tell me how much fountain costs in comparison, you are kind of right. While per serving, the syrup and water are cheap, the cost of the fountain machine and the continual upkeep make it more expensive than you think."}
{"text":"To me this is still a three star.  I do want to say that my review is part of my personal preference for a teriyaki bowl.  I prefer flank steak over the thin sliced steak and I also am not a huge fan of paying extra for vegis.  It's a coke and pepsi situation I guess, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't give them a try and make up your own mind.  The owner did reach out to me based on my last review and I commend him."}
{"text":"I moved to Las Vegas in 2001. Shortly after i discovered teriyaki madness. I can't say enough about the food it has always been great. I have been a loyal customer since. On Sunday my wife stopped on the way home to pick up food and left her brand new iPhone 6 behind. The staff found it and locked it away knowing someone would come back for it. This just reinforces my good feelings for this place. Not only do they have great food they are honest and trustworthy."}
{"text":"Chicken was okay not much flavor the vegetables had no seasoning and tasted raw. Will not be back. Panda Express has better flavor than this place!"}
{"text":"I love the quality of food at T-Mad and the service is quick. The staff is nice and happy to see you each day. This being next to a gym, makes it kinda cramped at times, but the place next door offers additionally sitting. Worth going back to, though it's a little on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Good and fast Teriyaki Meal.  The portion is big.  You have an option for rice bowl or plate.   My daughter and I ordered a rice bowl and a rice plate.  After receiving our order, we would have been fine with 1 rice plate.  Before buying too much, really decide how hungry you are.  The nice thing about their meal is it comes with steamed vegetables. The chicken was cook just right and not drenched in sauce.   Service was ok and fast.  Location is great with easy to find parking space."}
{"text":"I used to go here alot but I have cut back substantially. Now the only thing I get here is Pork Gyozas to take home or to mix with Chinese food I buy elsewhere like PeiWei. It's over priced especially if you want to add anything to your bowls. Service is also hit or miss. Sometimes it's great, sometimes if you call in an order you get put on hold and by the time they picked up again I was halfway there! (Hands free calling of course). 3 stars...is all they get.  Also I don't know why Yelp isn't showing my check-in from here but that needs to be looked at."}
{"text":"Just go here. Experience the madness. Get the plate with a salad. Get the extra teriyaki sauce. Just do it."}
{"text":"They don't have a huge menu, but they do what they do well.  Friendly service and good food.  And it's reasonably healthy too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last couple of years and I always leave a happy customer, and tonight was no different. Thank you Shiane for being patient with me when I wasn't exactly sure what I want, because everything is soooo good!!! what can I say???. My go-to place when I want something special for me."}
{"text":"Had lunch here,  food very tasty and plenty of it.  Had the orange chicken bowl,  would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome Service! Love Teriyaki Madness! Can't believe this location is not more busy definitely a diamond in the rough. Love the mixed veggies here and you can do the power bowl for no carbs."}
{"text":"Parents just moved into the area. Thought we would try the place. Heard several bad reviews about this particular establishment but decided to try it anyway. Should have listened. Had the spicy chicken plus beef teriyaki bowls which for 7.49 there was hardly any chicken, plus the chicken and the beef was overcooked and dry. The stir fry wasn't even cooked. Spent total $42.00. I told the cashier I had a 20% coupon she totaled my bill and said oops too late. :( I was not happy.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Pulled up at 9:25 and the dude turned the sign off . It's July 9th and I see that this place closes at 9:30pm ."}
{"text":"Just came in to grab a bite to eat. The food was hot & fresh & the food came out quick. Also they have a GoGo Tacos shop in side the same place. It was great to have a little bit of different kinds of food."}
{"text":"Teriyaki madness helped me lose weight very quickly I came in here almost daily for brown rice and grilled salmon with broccoli.  Every other day I'd call ahead and was able to pick up and order my food for a whole 2 weeks  I never ordered anything else  This consisted of about less than 10, shy visits I had to lose weight quick for a trip to the Caribbean and knew id be in a swimsuit for 10 days straight.  So I exercised daily, and ate nothing but salmon, and split it up with cottage cheese and Turkey from greens and proteins   Totally worked.  In 2 weeks I managed to shed 13 pounds.  I looked incredible- then went back to eating my usual Oreos and brownie brittle!"}
{"text":"Best teriyaki in Vegas period. Teriyaki Boy sucks and the only reason I go to Samurai SAMs is just because their egg rolls are grilled. Been going to this location for about two years and never had a bad meal. I go four days out of the week because it's healthy and it taste great. My favorite is the spicy chicken and noodles."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for food, the employee that brought our food didn't know which bowl was what...we ordered 5, so we took another two minutes trying to figure out what was what. The veggies were good but one person had a ton of broccoli and I only had in floret, another one in our group only got cabbage. Really should work on being more consistent with that. I know they are still training(or hope that's why it took so long) but in my chicken breast bowl the chicken was so dried out I couldn't chew it, it was like jerky, very dissatisfied. But to end on a good note, their teriyaki sauce had great flavor."}
{"text":"I was initially a little hesitant about going here because of some bad reviews. However after getting my food I was happy to see how much there was and after eating it I was very happy with how well the chicken was cooked and the vegetables were cooked properly as well.  I would recommend this anybody. I only gave it 4 stars because I've had better. But it was still good."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again! The sauce on the spicy chicken tastes burnt and the veggies were too chewy!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber eats. :)  I got a spicy orange chicken bowl with fried rice and I LOVED it! I would totally order from here once a week! I ate my food so fast I don't have any photos. If I had to make one tweak for next time I would cut out the veggies because I don't care for them and ask for extra spicy..was a little on the tame side.  Portion size is VERY large for one small person. Definitely got my value from my order!"}
{"text":"The pot stickers were over cooked almost burnt.  The teriyaki chicken tasted too salty.  The orange chicken was OK.  I've had much better.  Disappointed as it looked nice and smelled good."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place, when I called to tell them they said they'd have the manager call me, they never called...."}
{"text":"Great option if your sick of nasty Panda Express. Got two chicken teriyaki bowls. Very yummy no problems. Friendly cashier girl. Had to wait for food but received it very hot! This was my first time hopefully future visits will be the same."}
{"text":"Ridiculous experience . Made the mistake to try this place instead of Teriyaki healthy grill where I usually go, because today they didn't have noodles.   They say there are 4 oz of meat in this bowl but honestly when I seen it I thought they forgot to put meat. Only one bigger piece ( which was small as well) and some very very small for which U need to really search a lot. When I went back to them complaining they said it is 4 oz there. ( like I am Stupid). I weigh my food everyday at home I know how 4 oz of meat look very good. I wouldn't have made this review if they were at least adding some meat and make it like it is supposed to be. It's funny how they say u get addicted of this place- I had one experience here & had enough. No addiction for me lol. Teriaky Healthy grill is waaaay better."}
{"text":"Great staff and quick service. Ordering is easy because their menu isn't complicated. Love their green salad with their house dressing. Prices are reasonable too. Location is highly accessible and clean and has ample parking outside. They serve brown rice too! Which I love because it's not even the dry kind. However, this most recent time thAt I went there, I noticed a slight reduction in the service size. Didn't quite mind it because this is only the first time. But will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I was not expecting much when I walked in here but they have some really good food. Spicy Chicken is pretty good. Definitely better than any other establishment in it's genre in my opinion. thank you for the tip Kristie R. having it spicy makes all the difference. I can't wait to try the rest of the dishes."}
{"text":"It's like a fast food joint, comes out super quick. After the gym it is easy to just stop by and pick up something real fast.  I got the spicy chicken with brown rice and veggies. It was good, I like the fact that it comes in a good size bowl for the price you pay.   Staff is friendly and they do the best to keep the place clean. I seen the cashier regularly goes out to wipe the tables and the condiment area.   I would be back here if I ate all my meal preps. Lol"}
{"text":"So today 4/3/15  I decided to check this place & all I can say is wow. How horrible the cashier was so rude!  I go in not knowing the menu and had no idea how to order my food all I knew was that I wanted teriyaki chicken anyways. The cashiers name was Juan. I start to order the teriyaki plate & he asks me, would you like noodles or steamed rice. I replayed steamed rice.... So Juan goes okay what kind of steamed rice (with an attitude) so at first i thought okay maybe I should have known they made all kinds of rice??  after getting it all cleared. He then asked what will be your side? I didn't know what I could chose so I asked him what were my options & once again with an attitude tell me ughhh it's up their (pointing at the menu on the wall) saying right where it says sides! I looked at him & told him oh okay ty for being a Fucked smart ass. How rude it was obvious that it was my first time & he was just so horrible.  Not to mention that he also couldn't listen. when my food was ready they kept calling a Maria!?!?! & I finally went up and asked what the food was & yes of course it was my order!!!! Idk how he got Maria from Norma.. Clearly he wasn't paying attention or hey he might of thought she looks Mexican why not CALL HER MARIA!!! What an ass  This place suck in customer service  Food was ok but don't know if ill be going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Employees were really nice, they made sure we had all our sauces and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"It's close it's right outside my door I have had it one time didn't blow my mind . It's hard to compete with the Thai restaurant in the same plaza but it's there and that's pretty much it. Not too different than anything you can make at home the flavor is fair the portion is fair.  And the options aren't to broad. But if your a teriyaki kind of person you'll love it."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from our home so when we had a craving for some teriyaki chicken, we decided to try it out. We placed an order and it was ready for pickup when I arrived. I had the spicy teriyaki chicken with white rice and steamed veggies; I loved it!!! (I asked for some teriyaki sauce on the side and poured it on top cuz I'm a teriyaki fan) My boyfriend had teriyaki chicken, stir-fry veggies & fried rice; he wasn't a fan of the fried rice (this is where they lost the star) but everything else was delicious. Definitely would recommend this place!! Portions are huge, the price is reasonable and the customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat for lunch or any part of the day if you are looking for a simple meal. It is located in a decent location off of Blue Diamond and Decatur.   When you walk inside it has a pretty big dinning room to eat and there usually isn't any problem finding a table whenever I come here.   Menu is painless to read. First you choose the type of protein(s) such as chicken or beef. Next is the base such as rice, veggies or noodles. And last, a side such as veggies or a salad. If you brought the little kids, they also offer a special menu for them.   They also offer side items such as eggrolls, pot stickers, crab rangoons, shrimp tempura and/or edamame. All the items are reasonable price and my favorite are the pot stickers and crab rangoons.   I usually order the beef teriyaki, brown rice and the mac salad. I top it off with their teriyaki sauce and siracha. I mix my food around so I could get an evenly blend of my food to eat.   Overall I enjoy my meal and the staff are genuinely nice."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki and it was very delicious. The chicken had lots of flavors and to top it off the fried rice was amazing. Will be coming back soon. Thanks!"}
{"text":"So our last time we visited we had a hair in the teriyaki chicken bowl & were told that our next order would be on the house. We called in because we were in the area & apparently they said that we weren't in the system.   The attitude from the girl on the phone was also unnecessary. If you want to maintain customers don't you think you should maybe follow through with what you say.    Unless the manger calls back to comply with his original plan I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Never too packed with fast service. The food is flavored well and Im always satisfied. I always get the same thing, and havent been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Let's just sum up Teriyaki Madness as Americanized Japanese food. I wasn't impressed with the food or the service.   I was going to be in the Midtown area and decided to stop in for the first time. Since I planned to go I went ahead and signed up for their rewards/emails. I quickly received a buy one get one free with the purchase of 2 drinks offer...score!!!   When I arrived there was one table seated and another customer entered after us. The cashier  seemed busy and didn't make an effort to help either of us. My nephew and aunt needed to use the restroom so I stepped away from looking the menu over. Upon returning the other customer had ordered and the cashier stated he was ready to take my order. Being my first time I asked a few questions and he answered them very well.   We decided on 2 Chicken Teriyaki bowls with white rice and veggies and the Chicken Yakisoba noodles with no veggies. We also ordered the 2 fountain drinks to get the deal. When I showed the cashier my deal he seemed kind of confused. I didn't pay it much attention. I paid and then had to ask for a copy of my receipt.   Right after that the business seemed to really pick up and they got busy with a line almost to the door. The 2 cooks had to call back for extra help cooking. We took a seat and waited for our food. It took about 10 to 15 before our food to came out. It was wrapped up togo but we planned to eat inside the restaurant.   Now the food was exactly what I think of when I think of an Americanized version of Japanese food to be. The chicken in the Yakisoba had no flavor and my nephew drowned it in the super sweet teriyaki sauce on the table.  The noodles were over cooked and parts were crispy. My Chicken Teriyaki was super sweet and the only flavor I got was the sweetness from the teriyaki sauce.   After reviewing my receipt I noticed that I wasn't charged correctly. My deal stated that I would get one bowl free with the purchase of 2 fountain drinks. Well the cashier took of $5 from the bill but I still paid $2.99 for the free bowl.   Call me an Asian food snob but I have no intention in returning to Teriyaki Madness. My nephew (7 yrs old) seemed to love his chicken (he didn't even taste the noodles) so if he wants to come back I might bring him but that probably won't happen.

{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki beef bowl and at first I thought... Goodness, $10 for a teriyaki bowl? Then, when I got home and seen how much food they gave you I was alright with paying that much! :p This place will replace my Panda Express fix!"}
{"text":"On my mission to find out where all the ornamental food in Vegas is. I stumble across Teriyaki Madness. WHEEE! I'm crazy! It's madness. Don't you know I'm loco. Ok so this place is your signature fast food asian bowl joint. Guest starring Teriyaki Chicken and Beef. I usually get the spicy chicken. The portions are decent and food is pretty fresh. I like the flavors they use from fresh ingredients. This place is cool if you're dieting too! They have a low carb menu: where you can have Brown Rice instead of White. You can substitute stuff like Noodles instead of rice, Fried rice instead of white, Stir-Fry veggies instead of rice/salad, White meat instead of dark, etc...So yea ok I don't consider this fast food because it's not really processed! It's not fast food....it's convenient ;)"}
{"text":"Not the worst but not the best either. Nothing blew me away and as other posts have stated, mediocrity comes to mind. Take this with a grain of salt (as with all other yelp reviews) because I am definitely not a professional eater or reviewer. Maybe this can be someone else's favorite restaurant, but I can only speak on my experience."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite of the TMADs in my area. Chicken is almost shredded (hope it's shredded chicken and not something else) when it's suppose to be cut. Food looks as if it were just thrown together with little emphasis on appearance (as opposed to the TMAD on St Rose/Wigwam). If you're looking for an average meal at best, this is the place for you"}
{"text":"Soo good really liked the spicy chicken"}
{"text":"Poor service and the girl at counter tried to say I could not use the restroom! Don't you have to have a wash facility at a restaurant??? Health violations here!"}
{"text":"WOW HORRIBLE SERVICE GITL AT THE FRONT EITHER CANT HEAR OR CANT HANDLE STRESS! I'm the fourth the screwed up and I've only been here ten minutes. I don't know who runs this place management wise but this has to be fixed"}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE!!! There are nothing but children working there, no supervision. I have gone here about 5 times and EVERY SINGLE TIME they get my order wrong. The first two times I had to throw my food away when I drove all the way back home because I strictly ask for NO SAUCE of any kind due to a severe allergy and every time I have to ask them to remake it, and then i get attitude for asking! Plus they continually forget to put part of my order in the bag and I don't notice until I get home. On top of all that it always takes 30-40 min to make my order and it is rarely busy when I'm there. I am never wasting my money on this establishment again. Sad because the food is actually good, service SUCKS! I would rather drive further to Yogi's Grill. I've NEVER had issues there, although they have adults running the place so makes sense."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out because I kept hearing about how good it was ever since I moved to Las Vegas. I just moved in to a New area and was happy to find that there was one located down the street.  I came on a Saturday at 12pm, no line and about 3 tables in the decently sized restaurant. I was greeted by the cashier immediately and ordered a Spicy Chicken teriyaki bowl (7.49) with brown rice (no additional cost, that's a first!) and stir fried vegetables.  The menu is simple. You can choose between a bowl or plate, your choice of protein (chicken teriyaki, spicy chicken teriyaki, chicken breast teriyaki, beef teriyaki, orange chicken, chicken katsu, tofu teriyaki, a base of your choice (white rice, brown rice, or all veggies (no extra cost) or noodles or fried rice (additional $1.00). For a bowl you get stir fried vegetables and for a plate you can choose between fresh green salad, macaroni salad or stir fried vegetable.  I probably only had to wait about 8 minutes for my order to be taken out to me. The chicken was tender, moist and nicely marinated however I was not a fan of the spicyness and taste of the chicken. After taking the first bite, I admired the quality and tenderness of the chicken but immediately regretted my selection. Next time I come I will probably just get the regular chicken teriyaki and spice things up with the Siracha they have at every table or get a salmon bowl.  *for the quality and amount given, definitely worth the money*"}
{"text":"So I call at 8:50. Says they close at 9. I was asking if they're open. She says we close at 9. I say okay I'm about to park, but then she says they're closed and the other one on blue diamond is open sorry about that. Then I am sitting in the parking lot and I watch TWO separate people walk in still and order food. Yeah...... okay girl that's rude to tell people you're closing just so you don't have to deal with more customers. I would've walked in before those two customers.   Never coming back."}
{"text":"I probably go to this teriyaki madness location at least 2 times per week. The cashiers are always friendly and are very knowledgeable about the items on the menu. Everytime we go there, there's always an employee wiping tables in the dining area and asking people if they need anything. When I have used the restroom, I was shocked with how clean it was as compared to other fast food establishments and it even smelled clean and fresh as well. Our food always tastes great and at the proper temperature. I've lived in Henderson almost all my life and when that shopping center was built, all of the other food establishments that used to occupy the space where this Teriyaki madness branch is located, have gone out of business. It's exciting to finally see a food establishment succeed in that space and we are lucky on this side of Henderson to finally have a restaurant like Teriyaki Madness as an addition to the options to choose from in our area."}
{"text":"It's not terrible but for the price I expected to get actually what I ordered and that what they felt I should get. That's the polite way of saying they screwed up my order and they weren't willing to take care of it. It was $21 for two bowls and one soda. Seems a little expensive but you do get a lot of food."}
{"text":"First time to Teriyaki Madness , We had the spicy chicken with noodles and veggies .  Food was so fresh and cooked to perfection .  We will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Not the greatest teriyaki I have tasted and the choices are quite limited. However, the potion is good and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"You know what I use to eat at this location quite frequently but after my last visit which was about 4 months ago. I ordered a spicy chicken bowl and when I made it home and started eating it I bit down on a piece of metal that looked like it broke off from their grill. Needless to say that killed my appetite and I have not returned to any of their locations since. I had to give one star just based on that. Maybe it's just that Stephanie and the 215 location that has a deteriorating grill that has not been addressed yet or maybe it was someone's sick joke who works there but either way I will be staying away."}
{"text":"If you want a yummy and healthy meal this place really works wonders. Particularly their extra spicy chicken packs a punch and their power bowl is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the service is always very friendly. I signed up for the text alerts and I get great deals almost weekly. I love the sauce they use because it's obvious there is no MSG and it's low in sugar. Other teriyaki sauces cause my hands to swell and hurt. They also have a low carb, high protein plate and I'm a huge fan :)"}
{"text":"Telling these people what you want means nothing.  If they made burgers and you said no pickles you would get pickles.  They don't care. Order the same thing every time an ever had it made the way I have requested."}
{"text":"Why am I being asked to tip before I even get my food ? What happens if I push zero? I'm the asshole and have to wait longer or don't get enough chicken ?? And what service are you providing besides ringing up my order ? I have no problem tipping waiters and bartenders but this is a bit much! Other than that love the food but won't re visit this location."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, fast and friendly service. Def a great experience, will def eat here again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch spot that's filling, relatively healthy, and not fast food at all. They have no-carb and low-carb options, when I'm actually being healthful, and they have the best goddamn Crab Rangoons in the city. I could eat those by the bucket.  My go-to meal is the katsu bowl with white rice and veggies, and it's pretty much chicken, rice, and veggies in equal portion. Let me reiterate that. It's a bowl, and it's not 80% rice. 33% chicken, 33% rice, 33% vegetable. Mind. Blown.   The people are always friendly, and the service is fast, which makes it a perfect spot for a comfortable lunch. Take out and Eat in both cause equally few problems, and I can usually eat for under $10.  Pros; - Good food, good folk, good pace, good prices.  - Crab Rangoons, holy shit, crab rangoons.  Cons:  - There's not one in spring Valley.  - For eat in, the restaurant is pretty darn small."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness messed up my order and now I'm full of Teriyaki Sadness    Y'all forgot the noodles in my tofu bowl, still love u tho"}
{"text":"Spicy Chicken and Teriyaki beef bowls are the staple to get here. Fresh and made to order meals well worth the price."}
{"text":"It was ok food.  Grabbed a bowl of spicy chicken for lunch with veggies and brown rice came up to 9$ which is pretty pricey for lunch.  The spicy chicken was good but I felt the after effects of eating MSG.  I wouldn't eat here again because I dont like that sleepy feeling during work."}
{"text":"I have only tried this place once so I cannot comment on much of their food however I can tell you about what I got.   The stir fry with noodles and veggies was really good and I had Chicken Katsu on the side. The Katsu was okay, nothing wrong with it at all... I mean honestly the food was good.... not great... but good. If you are in the mood for this type of food and  you are close by I would absolutely stop by.   I myself would probably not come back on my own accord. If a friend invited me I would for sure go again.. however my choice.. I like L&L much better. Give this place a try for yourself and you decide. It was not horrible... but it was not that great..."}
{"text":"This place is whatever it's chicken and teriyaki pretty much the only reason I'm giving it three stars is because when I order on Postmates I ask for all veggies and they always loaded up with rice and even if I do order with rice there's like a mound of rice so it's about 80% rice and 20% meat and veggies"}
{"text":"I love this place! There food is made fresh & always satisfied with the service. My favorite is Spicy Chicken/Veggie Bowl..#DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"As much as my husband love, love, loved his spicy chicken bowl...the kids meal fell waaay short. I got my son the beef bowl and the meat was really subpar. Fatty grizzle all up in the bowl. Better stick with the chicken if you want consistancy."}
{"text":"Have always had a two protein plate at the other two locations of Teriyaki Madness, but the location on Sahara and Decatur couldn't or wouldn't offer...wiling to pay the up charge but the cashier didn't offer that.  I was told I had to get the bowl and pay a extra $5 if I wanted two proteins.  Is that the same as a plate.???  Won't be coming back or recommending this location to any friends or co workers.  Cynthia"}
{"text":"This place is a complete hit or miss. But when it's a hit, it's really yummy. When it's a miss, the chicken is so burnt half of it is completely black and the other half is stained with the taste of burnt chicken you can't even eat it. And when I complained to the manager or whoever she was and showed her the solid black chicken, she seemed more annoyed with me than with her unskilled cooks. It's been 50/50 every time I've eaten here, never know if the food is going to be good or toxic."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm on a roll with these amazing places to eat haha. Had the bowl from this place for dinner the other night. It was awesome. The bowl was a really good size. Way bigger than your panda bowl. The food is great. I had the spicy chicken teriyaki. I wanted more as soon as I was done. I will definitely be taking my friends to Teriyaki Madness in the next few days."}
{"text":"Great teriyaki bowls, fast and fun. Can get a bit pricy if you are not careful.   I enjoy that this place is right next to our gym. But if not for that I'm not sure if I would travel far to get here.   The chicken Katsu is crunchy and moist. The spicy chicken has a little kick and the teriyaki is sweet and smoky. My only complaint might be that 7-10 dollars is bit steep for a bowl/box of rice with a bit of meat. Between my wife and I getting a meal, an appetizer and drinks this goes up to 30 bucks pretty quick. The portions are enough for leftovers though so maybe not the worst.    A good solid 3. Worth a try once. And every now and then if you are close.  My personal favorite is the beef yakisoba box."}
{"text":"The food is okay, americanized of course. I wouldn't come here if it wasn't for living 2 minutes away. Every single time I go here, they get my order wrong. Every single time I go here, when I tell them my order is wrong, they roll theyes. Seriously? Nothing but attitude from the girl with the blond hair who would rather talk to her boyfriend sitting at the bar. I'm sorry my fiancé is diabetic and needs the super sugary sauce on the side, I guess? Giving me 3 free bowls next time I come in is nice I guess, but it doesn't make up for that along with blaming \"you work with a bunch of boys\"."}
{"text":"Yes, they are very small, but I wasn't here for the ambiance. The place is very clean and the food is UH-MAY-ZING!  It's easy to get in and out of, nicely located right off of Pecos and across from the gym. (Which is kind of ironic, but I guess a plateful of noodles is always a plus after a good workout).  The guys that work there were super polite and very sweet. I came in mere minutes before they were closing, but they didn't even mention it. The food is made to order, so don't expect it to be fast.  But, do expect it to be worth the wait!  I got chicken teriyaki with brown rice for the hubby and beef yakisoba for me. For the ride home, an order of potstickers. I was the only one there and we chatted a bit as they cleaned up around me and turned off the \"open\" signs.  One of the boys brought the food right out to me, piping hot and bagged up to go. I joked about the giant dispenser of sauce and its awesomeness. He said that a lot of folks like that, and found it odd that none of the other stores have it. Then we laughed about how chintzy some restaurants are about their sauce - charging for each tiny container - as I filled up my fourth and stuffed it in the bag.  I made my way back to the car in chilled December night (almost tucked the food inside my coat to stay warm - brrrr!), tossed it in the car, and headed  home.  The potstickers didn't make the ride. I had nommed those down before the second stoplight. Crispy - like I like them!  The \"teriyaki for my husband, yakisoba for me\" thing was really just a ruse. I didn't want to let on that I wanted both and was simply going to be a big piggy about the whole thing, since the hubby was at a business meeting and wouldn't be home until late. I figured this was slightly more healthy than my original plan of tacos and champagne.   When I got home and opened the boxes, it turns out that they may have caught on to my little scheme, because there was enough food in there to feed a small nation! I was only able to make a small dent in each, and as I retired, full and a bit woozy from yummy goodness to the couch, my husband came home and was thrilled at the hot, relatively healthy meal waiting for him.  Sure, honey...I thought you might like that...  Even after he ate until full, I still had enough for breakfast the next morning. Believe it or not, he has a bigger appetite than I do.  To recap: Guys nice, food incredible, portions gigantic. Share!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and took nearly 30 minutes and the place was empty. The few people that did come in while we were waiting were sketchy and made the long wait very uncomfortable. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"I eat TMadd once a week since my work had an account with them. The location I go to is S.Decatur and Blue Diamond. They are good.. But... THIS location in Lake Mead is AMAZING.  The chicken taste better. The Rice is WAY better. The Mac salad and Tempura Shrimp is even better.  The location on S.Decatur and B.Diamond needs to take notes!!!"}
{"text":"They have really good teriyaki chicken bowls and rice, and it's quick service. Love love love going here if you're looking for takeout or somewhere new and quick to eat this is the place :)"}
{"text":"Good solid fast deliciousness. Can't go wrong with anything you order here- it really is addictive. Decor and sitting areas are clean and simple, could maybe use a little sprucing up/brightening, but is clean and that's what matters most."}
{"text":"Very good. Not a bad experience.   Just got a beef bowl, brown rice, and stir fried. Very good, and I'd go back when I want to grab a quick bowl. Extra sauce is always good! So if you're craving teriyaki, you cant go wrong with this place.   I also loved the fact they have fried tofu as well. I'm trying that next time I go there!"}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Teriyaki Madness for years!  I always order the spicy chicken bowl and add vegetables with white rice.  It's not exactly the most healthy choice from their long list of healthy choices, but it's not like a cheeseburger or anything.  And plus, I'm Asian so the whole brown rice thing just doesn't do it for me.  The chicken is grilled to perfection with a sweet spicy sauce.  They give you teriyaki sauce you can pour over your bowl, but you don't even need it so if you're on a healthy kick, skip the extra sauce.  The food is still so delicious.  The bowl is huge and should probably be eaten in 2 sittings, but again, coming from an Asian family, eating one meal in 2 sittings is just unheard of.  By the time I finish my bowl, I am so stuffed and satisfied.  I've never ever left Teriyaki Madness unsatisfied."}
{"text":"After driving some distance to tryout the Hawaiian place a couple doors down only to find that it was closed on Mondays, I decided I might as well stop in to Teriyaki Madness for kicks and giggles.  Basically, this place is an expensive Panda Express.  The food is ok, but I dropped $10 on my food (without drink) and found that the vast majority of my dish was white rice.  I felt a little gypped having paid so much and getting skimped on the meat, I don't think I will be going back.  The food is cooked fresh, which is a plus, and they do have healthy options on the menu. But it really just isn't that great."}
{"text":"I really love this place its clean, they serve the food fresh & fast  . the food is highly addictive."}
{"text":"The spicy teriyaki chicken is everything! A must try.  also, the grilled veggies and brown nice."}
{"text":"The owner reached out to me today 3/19/18 & apologized for our long wait. That says alot about wanting to please his customers. Changing my review to 3 stars until we try the food again. Why because all the staff was so nice, and just buried with orders. Plus the place was spotless.  We tried Teriyaki Madness today 3/18/18, mid afternoon. Lightly crowded upon arrival & placed our order. 45 minutes later our food came out barely warm. I promptly took it up to the counter and got a refund. Obviously the food delivery companies are the priority here as 7 different drivers came in while we waited. The young girl that was working the counter was very nice and apologized many times. She deserves a raise. If you are too busy tell the customer so they can go elsewhere. Bring out a small appetizer or something if you are going to operate like this. 97.5 A clean rating was nice to see & the food smelled good. Just not right today."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. It's affordable. I like the fact you can choose your meat but I was a little disappointed to not see shrimp listed. You can't choose the type of rice you would like as well if you would like noodles as a base. The veggies weren't over cooked. I would definitely come back. The only hiccup was we went during lunch and somehow they lost our ticket but they made up for it by giving som excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Absolutely, the worst restaurant I have been in in a very long time. 30 minutes for me to get a bowl of chicken. I ended up walking out because the service was so bad and the employees were obviously high as a kite.  Don't waste your time. I won't ever again. Didn't ever get my food."}
{"text":"We came around noon on a Friday so it was pretty packed but the line went quick. I ordered a bowl with katsu chicken & noodles, my husband ordered a plate which came with 2 scoops of white rice, vegetables & tertiary chicken breast. I decided to try the chicken egg roll as well, now normally any cashier will mention if an item will take longer to make or cook & if it's ok for you to wait but this wasn't the case here. We placed our order & watched everyone finish lunch but we were still waiting 20 mins in. We go ask the cashier what's taking long & she said the egg rolls can take 20 to 25 minutes. Ok?! She could have warned us prior to ordering because our food was ready, sitting there getting cold & we were waiting for one small egg roll! Finally our egg roll is done with not so much as a sorry for the wait or the inconvenience & the food was NOT so great & pretty pricey at $25 for 3 items, no drinks. The katsu was a bit dry, noodles were greasy not much flavor, my husband's food was better than mine though as the chicken breast teriyaki was the best part of both meals. The 20 plus minute egg roll? That was so so. We probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Extremely slow.  Didn't even bring out my order until cashier was questioned about why others who had placed their orders after me got their food first.  Not even an apology given.  The manager of this store seriously needs to do some customer service education for the staff. The Teriyaki Madness on Centennial Center Blvd is much friendlier and faster."}
{"text":"This has to be my 4th or 5th time here, everything is really good, but that Chicken Breast Teryaki bowl is awesome! Me and my wife both highly recommend this location due to the friendly service and quick too. Food is always great lol"}
{"text":"This seems like a cool place. We stopped in to try it, (first timers) and we got 20% off of our order. The waitress was really sweet and let us know our food would be out in 15. Then she offered us free potstickers; I'm assuming because the food would be a little while.  It's not super clean inside. They do have a medium selection of food. I rated 3 stars because this place is your run-of-the-mill fast food establishment. I gave an extra star for the above average service. I would recommend this for some quick Asian fast food."}
{"text":"Food was cold because cashier made me wait over 15min on a PHONE order. Short post for terrible customer service, thanks for cutting my lunch break in half.  Although their food is pretty decent, what made me more upset is that he saw me standing there staring at my food  and didn't even bother to look at it, instead he gives everyone else's orders except mine and clearly he knew I ordered my food 10 minutes before I drove here"}
{"text":"Just moved to this side of town so this location is convenient for me. The food is great however the a few of the employees should not be in customer service. The first time I came, the girl at the register had the biggest attitude like I was inconveniencing her while she took my order, snatched my money out of my hand and was texting on her phone.  I went earlier today again and of course wasn't surprised. The cook was coughing 6 times over the chicken and not once did he cover his mouth. Then an employee came in on her day off and was just hanging around in the back with of course no hair net, talking to other employees, distracting them while it was a busy time of day.  I would be highly disappointed if I was the owner of this franchise. Like I said, the food doesn't disappoint but the employees need evaluating."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their spicy chicken teriyaki!!! I also like their chicken teriyaki and orange chicken. Food is prepared fresh to order. The facility is always clean and the customer service is great. I would definitely recommend this place. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Great food! Nice staff and very clean!! I love the professionalism and customer service ! I definitely will come again.....and again! Lol"}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because I love the food, but tell me why they wouldn't serve my husband when walked in the restaurant during their hours of business & said they \"turned off their equipment at 8:30 so they can be closed by 9\" is this a joke?? I could MAYBE understand if we got there like 5-10min before they closed but he walked in at 8:40 and they honestly told him they stopped serving people ten min prior to that. If you're looking for your sales to drop and lose loyal customers you're doing a great job."}
{"text":"Great food and prompt service!  Hands down the best teriyaki chicken in LV.  Try the spicy mild!"}
{"text":"The food here is good. The problem is the staff. I called in an order and when i arrived had not been made. They were sorry and asked if they could make it for me then. When I paid I had a coupon but it was declined as it came from a different location. I placed my order at 6:16 arrived at 6:36 and left with my food at 7:02.  Not what I have budgeted for carryout.  There are five other places to buy chicken in the same complex. Get your act together TM or you won't survive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time on Monday. It was the late afternoon & still a steady stream of cutomers coming in and out. Service was great. Cashiers friendly & the staff preparing the food seemed to be busy & involved in their roles too!  I had the spicy chicken. Grilled chicken that comes with the option of noodles, white rice or brown rice. I went with the noodles. They also offer veggies along with it & you can pick & choose which ones you'd like. Choices- cabbage, carrots, broccoli, onion, celery and zucchini.  My daughter had the kids meal: Orange Chicken ( which is not breaded) with white rice & just broccoli. Wait time for the food was somewhat slow. However, they were having issues with their registers which delayed the whole process. At the table they provide their own teriyaki sauce which is really good. Also, offer a soy sauce & sriracha sauce.  I thought my meal was just average in flavor, however my daughter really like her. I will say her Orange Chicken was real good for not being the fried breaded type-Much healther too!  Staff made our experience a plus! That's why I'm giving it 4 stars!"}
{"text":"This was the most delicious Teriyaki Madness I've ever had.  This location is new, fresh, and outstanding.  Keep doing what you're doing guys!"}
{"text":"Was going to give this place a try but I called to order since I read a review that service was slow inside and I was placed on hold for 15min. Just ridiculous!! Guess it wasn't meant for me to try."}
{"text":"Out of the teriyaki places in town, teriyaki madness would be my go to.  BUT, their portion sizes are lacking.  I track the ounces & grams of my food and what they tell me is never what I'm given.  They don't give enough meat.  A picture says a thousand words.  And I got about 2-3 ounces of meat."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The staff is friendly and welcoming and the cooks always make my orders the right way. This restaurant has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"fast friendly service.. I'm here all the time because the food is always delicious , I'm vegetarian, my husband is not,so it's always our go to! Awesome for everyone ."}
{"text":"I like teriyaki madness. It taste stays consistent when I got do different locations. This is my go to spot when I didn't have time to food prep. I usually get an all veggie chicken breast bowl with sauce on the side. I usually get weekly coupons for buy one get one in the mail every other week. So that's a plus."}
{"text":"Meh...  Pros: Clean restaurant and friendly staff.  Cons: Stirfry veggies consisted of 85% cabbage. The remainder of the food is not bad, but also nothing to rave about.   Details: Food was nothing special. I got the spicy chicken plate with brown rice and stirfry veggies. $8.99. The chicken was tender and the flavor was decent."}
{"text":"Wow! After yelping how T-Mad never disappoints, I kinda want to revise my review.  We go today, again, cause I love their food, but I was totally disappointed! Our bowls were so skimpy! It's like they barely scrapped enough food together to make our 3 bowls. It was so sad! Don't know if I'll return to this location. Might have to make the drive to the one on Maryland Pkwy & Silverado Ranch, my old neighborhood."}
{"text":"Everytime I order here food is fresh and amazing. Service is fast. Go to place for protein!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy teriyaki chicken plate. great charred taste and a kick of spiciness. I did not like the teriyaki sauce because it was strong in ginger but I did like the chicken overall. The edamame was perfectly cooked... crispy and tasty. A lot of places tend overcook theirs and make it soft. I was very happy with this. It's great for a quick bite. But don't expect anything more. I dropped it a star because I thought it'd be better than mall chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"A little more expensive than I think warranted. Noodles were good, I forgot to ask to add veggies, and she didn't ask. :("}
{"text":"We had a Groupon so decided to give it a try. The portions were huge, we both have leftovers for dinner. The spicy chicken was amazingly flavorful. It was so spicy my nose was running, which is a good thing! The only reason I gave it four stars was because the rice was tasteless on its own, but if you mix it with the chicken, it is a perfect combination. I didn't plan on eating the rice by itself anyway. After the Groupon, we paid less than 10 bucks for  spicy chicken teriyaki bowl, spicy chicken teriyaki plate with side salad, and two drinks! We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My new addiction is this place for sure! The chicken is always cooked perfectly and served quickly. My biggest props is that the chicken is cut very well and you knew every piece of chicken dies does not have fat arround it. Everyone is very friendly there too."}
{"text":"This place was great. Not sure why the bad reviews i trully would go back.   The chicken was tasty and the attention was soo very nice."}
{"text":"After two unsuccessful attempts to serve me actual hot food I gave up. Had the teriyaki Bowl and both times was barely warm. The only thing barely above warm was the brown rice. That is to say both times. I even mention to them that the cold chicken was not a good idea to serve to customers."}
{"text":"I really don't get why everyone likes this place. I've gone twice and disappointed both times.  The first time I went the food was very bland. They give you a ridiculously large serving which can be nice if you like leftovers.  Both times the food has been extremely watery. By the end, the vegetables are just sitting in a puddle of water which ruins the little teriyaki flavor there is."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Teriyaki place I've eaten in a bit. Burnt meat with noodles that seem like it's from a package of Maruchan Ramen....normally would feed left overs to our dog as a treat but didn't want to give them this stuff...won't return. Shoulda went to Noodles like planned!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for a quick meal.  You can customize your bowl or plate to your tastes, saving needless time spent picking out the things you didn't want there in the first place. I keep it simple--chicken breast bowl over brown rice. You mix it up however you'd like. Teriyaki Madness is delicious."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot for my teriyaki noodles craving, but it was very busy.  The portion size was lacking , but what got me was the chicken strips where almost rubber and very hard to chew. That part turned me off from going back for a while. Great for a snack or quick lunch but not a dinner. I don't eat a lot and I was still hungry after eating their bowl. You get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Delicious meal casual comfortable environment affordable prices and friendly staff! I highly recommend Territaki Madness! Lunch dinner open 11am-9pm"}
{"text":"For a chain this place is pretty decent. I love the Crab Rangoons and Pot Stickers. The staff was friendly and the service was quick. The dining area is super clean and has TVs. I had mine to go. This visit was my first here and I have looked for a good place to eat this type of food. I think Teriyaki Madness is my go to moving forward. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is fairly straightforward, it's a fast casual westernized teriyaki bowl option that is good for take out or a very casual sit down meal if you're in a rush. The ambiance is...interesting. On the night that I went, it had a frat house feel with a lot of young college guys who took up most of the booths and all seemed to know each other. I think there is also a lot of EOS traffic that stops through here after workouts.   All in all, the food is okay, but I would recommend taking it to go. There also isn't a lit sign on the back of the building which can make tracking it down a bit difficult if you don't know where you are going."}
{"text":"I love these places! I cannot say enough great things about the food and the service. This is a brand new location so it is extremely clean and bright. I had my usual Spicy Chicken and a side of Edamame."}
{"text":"This food is so fresh and it tastes wonderful! The new location works great for me because it is so easy to park and run in get my food and be home without any hassle. The place was very busy but me food was ready in under 5 minutes from the time I ordered. The service was great and the place is spotless clean. You can also see the whole kitchen which I always like when eating out."}
{"text":"This place is small but fast. There is always a crowd but it moves extremely quickly and there is a great vibe to the place. The food is outstanding and the place is always spotless clean. 5 stars for me when I need to get my teriyaki fix."}
{"text":"A friend and I came to TM after a couple hours at the gym, so you can imagine I was starving!  The place was a small hole in the wall, packed with people, so I know it was going to be good.  Seemed like the staff was super young all around: the cashier, cook, etc., but all very good looking :)  I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl and asked to substitute my rice for vegetables.  I was trying to be healthy, but when I got home, looked like they weren't even listening because I got no veggies and all rice.  The dish was still really good!  The chicken was perfectly charred and the teriyaki sauce was not to over powering.  The portions were big and really satisfied my cravings.  The white rice was PERFECT!  I'm a sticky rice kinda guy and they hit it on the money, even though I ordered veggies instead!   All in all, the one thing I learned from this experience is to check my food before I walk out.  Other than that, I would recommend this place to the food enthusiast searching for a quick Asian dish."}
{"text":"This place really hits the spot!  Came here with a couple of friends before a day of shopping.  I'm not a big fan of the location.  It's in a strip mall wedged down a small road off the freeway.    On this particular visit, I was part of a super funny and super awkward conversation with the cashier:  Cashier: what's your name? (for the order)   Me: Rockne   Tiffany, my friend: Rockne, you need an easier name like Bill   Me: (in my white trash voice) my name is Bill.   Cashier: uhh, my name is Bill.   Me: (back tracking) oh, that's a really cool name!   AWKWARD!!! I didn't mean to insult him.  I was just trying to make a joke, but it would be me to create such an awkward situation.    For lunch, I got the 2 choice special for about $9.  I chose the orange chicken and the chicken katsu.  My side was the mac salad.  I wasn't a huge fan of the mac salad.  Needed a little more mayo.  The chicken katsu was white meat and crispy.  The katsu sauce was a little more tangy than I prefer, but did the trick.  I loved the orange chicken.  Crispy, breaded chicken, coated in a thick orange sauce.  Soooo good!  Served with sticky white rice which makes me feel like I'm back home in Hawaii.    All in all, everything was delicious and worth coming back to.  I'm happy that I live close to this place.  Thank goodness I can find it.  You definitely need to check this place out as well!"}
{"text":"I love this place a lot. Food is always well prepared, fresh and great. Personal is very frieblndlt. Highly recommend to use veryvody."}
{"text":"We ordered to-go.  Chicken Katsu plate+ $1 add veggies- Katsu was a little overcooked so inside was a bit dry and the crispy was that hard crisp when it sat too long in the fryer. A Veggie mix consist of cabbage, carrot, zucchinis and broccoli and seem to be fresh since none were overcooked and still have a bit of crunch.   Chicken teriyaki plate- the chicken was juicy. I couldn't quite place why the sauce tasted familiar but it came to me later today it tasted just like Yoshida sauce that you can buy at Costco.   Plate portions are hearty and also come with choice of mac salad which was decent or a side salad (typical iceburg mix with poppy honey mustard vinegrette) The BF and I shared and had leftovers.  Not bad for a quick meal, but I think I will stick with the grilled meats instead of the katsu."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great quick but healthy alternative to standard fast food or Chinese take out. I always get the same thing... but it's delicious. .. so why mess with perfection?   Spicy chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies,  and a side of edamame.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I'd have to say that Teriyaki Madness is one of the better Teriyaki fast food joints around.  They offer a variety of meats (chicken, pork, beef teriyaki, chicken katsu, orange chicken).  The food isn't really authentic Asian or anything, but it sure beats Panda Express!  My favs here are the beef and chicken teriyaki.  They say they grill everything to perfection and they're sort of right?  Everything is always cooked pretty good!  It's never dry and very flavorful.  Their teriyaki sauce is really good and is the perfect consistency.  I also like getting their mac salad.  It's better than just getting a plain garden lettuce salad on the side.    If you trying to eat healthy, this is a pretty good option for a quick meal.  Just get the chicken breast, sauce on the side, brown rice and veggies.  Done!  I also love their gyoza's.  They are kind of small, but not a bad deal for less than 3 bucks.  Their plates are around 7-8 bucks and their bowls around 6.  Quality food, but kind of pricey.  It can kind of add up if you try customizing your meal with the brown rice, veggie add ons, etc.  The portions aren't exactly huge or anything - each plate is just enough for one person IMO.  So for 2 people, you're looking to spend at least 20 bucks for dinner which is kind of a lot for fast food.  If not for the price I would give it one more star!  This particular location on Warm Springs is pretty nice compared to the one I used to frequent on Eastern and Maryland.  Its clean and the service is quick and nice. Always keep an eye out for coupons/groupons... I always see coupons in the newspaper and online."}
{"text":"If you think the prices are high, then you're probably not a college student. The store is really clean and you can sit anywhere you want.  So I asked for beef and they gave me chicken, and then I returned it and they gave me beef. So they have really responsive service. They give you a whole lot of rice and not a lot of meat, which would have been fine if the meal weren't so bland. Honestly, if I just wanted brown rice, I could have just stayed home."}
{"text":"Insanely good.  I want to try something other than the spicy chicken but it's so damn good I get it every time.  This place is amazing."}
{"text":"Food is always satisfying and hits the spot. Chicken katsu Is the bomb! Person at the register always remembers my name..lol don't know if that's a good thing but it's nice to know that they remember repeat customers and repeat quality."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Overpriced. I bought the orange chicken, beef teriyaki and the katsu chicken.  Nothing special. Panda Express does a \"better job\". I had such higher expectations.   Edamame were stale and boring."}
{"text":"Many moons ago when I used to work at the 24 hour fitness across the same parking lot, this was my go to place. Solid healthy options as long as you go easy on the teriyaki sauce. I always order spicy chicken with brown rice and veggies. Sometimes all veggies. I've had yakisoba,and the bowls with noodles and veggies. Noodles on any combo $1 more and they're really tasty with beef and veggies, but my favorite is the spicy chicken. Something about is so amazing. It's char grilled which I love and has just enough heat but not overwhelming. Solid healthy tasty food that's perfect for me when I'm lazy to cook or good to eat anytime really. Best part is I can eat it for 2 meals! Just be careful because the warning sign of how addicting they are is clearly posted! You've been warned ;) I am an addict but I don't want help. Lol!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and decent teriyaki chicken. Food comes out relatively fast. I've never had a bad experience. A good high protein meal for aure"}
{"text":"Waited forever and a day for my teriyaki bowl with white meat and vegetables. Nothing special. Price maybe $8 or so. Size was too large and nothing special. Flame broiler is way better."}
{"text":"I have to give teriyaki madness a 5 star review. This is by far the best teriyaki chicken I have had in vegas. I went into the restaurant at 9:50pm near to closing time, I must say the employees here have good customer service. Without any attitude they  took my order and as usual the food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for a post workout meal. Portions are always weighed out correctly and the food is extra delicious. The staff here is amazing and very friendly as well. They remember me every time I come in and make it feel like home. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Spicy Chicken and veggie bowl. Plenty of meat for the price and tasty. However, the bed of veggies (mainly cabbage) was drenched in a bit too much oil for my taste so I left the majority of the veggies in the bowl."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! Me and my boyfriend love this place probably a little too much but it's so quick and very tasty. We have had our orders come out wrong a couple of times but the staff always seems to be nice and very helpful. I would definitely suggest ordering over the phone then picking up its a lot faster and easier."}
{"text":"This place is madness for sure in their service.  The food takes forever, I have never done delivery, this is just waiting for take out.  Employees socializing with the management every time I have been there, which contributes to slow service.  The food is very good though and fresh.  They have improved the veggies some, but they are heavy on the cheaper veggies like onions and cabbage, more broccoli please.  You can go to Panda express and pay a lot less for better veggies."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and staff always friendly. Director of operations is very nice. He mentioned teriyaki madness might be coming to Boulder City. Please please come here. I would eat there more that the once a week like I do now."}
{"text":"This location does not sell fresh food. I went at 11:00 AM and got the orange chicken bowl. The chicken was extremely soggy and inedible. This food was disgusting and a huge waste of $8. I will never go again. I also waited over 10 mints for these leftovers. Panda express across the street would of been much better quality.  I love teriyaki madness over on stephanie street, the chicken is fresh and crunchy."}
{"text":"Loved the new menu. Food was flavorful and the steamed veggies were perfect. Sticky rice in my Spicy Chicken bowl was just the right amount of sticky. Staff very friendly. Thanks again Teriyaki Madness!!!"}
{"text":"The TM's on Decatur and Tropical is definitely dropping the ball lately.  Dry beef and at most 3oz of spicy chicken (from 2/11/17 order).  It's a shame really, I enjoy the one on Craig and Revere... seems I eat at TM's too much and know what I should expect.  Pick up your game or the other restaurants in the area are gonna put you out of business!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  My husband had the Tofu Vegetable noodle plate, and I had the chicken breast vegetable bowl.  We ordered our food online and it was ready when we arrived.  The food had a good flavor, and was not too salty as most teriyaki dishes are.  Teriyaki Madness rates up there as one of my faves, and we will be back for more delicious dinners."}
{"text":"I'm frustrated at this place. They've messed up my food twice less than a week!!!! I tried calling last week & someone picks up but that's it. You're not on hold...no one answers and acknowdges you. It's just silenced. And yet I'm the stupid customer that still tips them. I've worked in the food industry during my college years so I always have a soft spot for them BUT seriously enough is enough!!! Last week, I ordered 2 Protein Plate (spicy beef teriyaki w/ chicken katsu) with choice of Mac salad. My Katsu was over cooked - the breaded part was litterally too brown & super dry plus it was missing the Katsu sauce! The mac salad was super al dente...I don't mind al dente but not when the pasta clearly still needed to be cooked. That was very disappointing!!! Today, I placed a to go order and requested spicy beef teriyaki with noodles but instead, I got spicy chicken with noodles. I tried calling; same scenario, my calls gets picked up but no one acknowledges and its just dead air! It takes me 15 minutes one way to come and pick up the food (my work is on Higley & Mckellips). It's frustrating to be driving 30 minutes round trip to have your food not be the way you want it to be. Customer Service needs some pruning. I want to give you my business. I mean its not only me that's ordering. I usually get 4 or 5 of my co-workers to order with me. So I do bring business in; but YOU need to get it together!"}
{"text":"Before, you look and say (gasph) 1 star let me start off by saying the colors, decor, staff and local is nice. Great actually, very clean with room for guest both inside and out. The parking lot is tight, however, yelp is about the food. So, lets get down to business  I ordered the teryiakki bowl with white meet, fried rice and crab ragoons.  1. The meet as cooked and cut in long strips... Ok no biggie 2. The rice was mushy (over cooked) and split open, there were no other veggies just an over abundance of peas which were undercooked. 3. There was no seasoning in the rice. 4. The Veggies were slimmy. 5. The sauces was the brown gelitin oze that was poured over the chicken and has absoluty no flavor. It still had lumps in it as if it wasnt warmed up all the way. It turned the chicken bland (There was a side of soysauce too. 6. Food wasnt hot or fresh from the wok.   I did eat my over cooked and driedout ragons.  I did not finish my meal. I cut the chicken into bite size peices, took 5 bites. Did some work. Tried another bite and tossed it. Waste of $16. My review is of the food only. The girls inside were plesent, professional, curtious and answered questions thoroughly.   Im not thee biggest foodie but when wanting protien and rice there are many more other options. I hope that this was a one off. I was given a coupon for b1g1 which i have to my boss as shes been looking forward to the openning and addtl free drink coupons to co workers to try it for themselves but as for me I wont be back."}
{"text":"I compare this place to Waba Grill. I like Yaki Madness. They have a great selection on the menu and it's all very customizable. Everything we ordered was made from scratch. I'd definitely go back again. And it's great when no Waba is around!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  New owners and new crew! Your experience here will not disappoint. Delicious food, friendly crew, nice vibe, and very clean. Great location as well!  Options for everyone. We had a fantastic experience!\""}
{"text":"It's was hot and I was hungry. Stopped in for a quick bite to eat. Ordered some appetizers and some yakisoba noodles. Cashier asked if I'd like my noodles medium which translates into would you like some siracha mixed in to the point of your eyes watering. Um yeah, it was still good.  Pot stickers were meh. Egg rolls were awesome and reminded me of the Ming pork egg rolls my parents would buy at Sam's Club in the 90's. I have a thing for ground pork egg rolls and these definitely hit the spot.  Onto the noodles, these were very tasty and a huge portion that could feed a family of 4. There was no way I was going to make it around the pile of noodles, chicken and vegetables in my enormous black take out container. Teriyaki Madness needs to purchase some beefier chop sticks because mine were puny and warped. I had to use a fork because my chop sticks broke under the tremendous weight.  All and all I'd go back and eat a ton of egg rolls."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I decided to give it another try after the manager commented about my previous review. Well guess what? Even more underwhelming. Out of Shrimp, Out of Beef, out of BOWLS just plates. Unreal. They need to properly analyze supply & demand. Mind I say it was early on a Sunday and they were out of all this.     Underwhelming. The Mesa location is much better despite not being brand new. The cashier was not friendly and you could tell he would rather be anywhere else besides doing his job.   Couldn't tell me gluten free options just said the chicken might be. Well let me chance it based on what this kid might think. I wouldn't be surprised if he even had the slightest clue what gluten meant.   To top off a already shitty experience they didn't have any macaroni salad. So I left with nothing. 2 strikes and your out. I'll beep and wave on my way to the Mesa location."}
{"text":"Good menu selection, friendly service and reasonable menu prices for being a counter-service restaurant. It does always take a while to get your food (which is great) but one has to assume that anything good and freshly prepared takes a few minutes to produce."}
{"text":"Really good chain I tried in the Summerlin / Vegas area.  Had slick chicken with well cooked rice -- delicious.  Fast, tasty efficient.  Would like to see these more in CA.  Spice was right on !!"}
{"text":"The food was good BUT I will say that the staff was talking and CHANGING TRASH BAGS about 2 feet away from where I was eating. why can't they wait till I get up? They were speaking loudly, talking about cars and SWEARING while there are children around. I understand they are young but management needs to crack the whip and maybe be around more often. So unprofessional.  And I work in the industry!"}
{"text":"Decent fast food at decent prices.  Went with the teriyaki chicken plate, so that we could have rice and sides for all of our yummy Poke we bought next door.  They were very cool there, and didn't give us a hard time about eating the poke there in their restaurant.  Chicken was good, but not mind blowing.  Plenty of food to go around though, and the prices were around $10 for the plate and a drink.  Mac salad wasn't bad....rice was nice and fresh.  Not a bad choice if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food is pretty solid here, can't really go wrong with grilled chicken. I had the spicy chicken teriyaki bowl with a side of tempura. The chicken was spicy with spice level just about right for my taste, not too hot and not too mild. The shrimp tempura was good also, it was hot and crunchy. My daughter had the kids meal with teriyaki chicken, she didn't enjoy it as much because there was too much teriyaki sauce on it but overall everything was good."}
{"text":"Costumer service is great! Place is clean! Food is good! BUT a bit over priced in my opinion for a basic teriyaki meal. I wish they'd add more food on the menu"}
{"text":"The food is good and the place is clean. I like their spicy chicken breast bowl with brown rice."}
{"text":"Good, quick place to stop for lunch.  The staff is always friendly, very warm, accommodating.  They are helpful with the menu for people who have never been there.  The shop is clean and well organized.    The portions are pretty large, especially for lunch.  I opt to get the kids portion of tofu and fried rice.  It comes with a drink at a price that you can't beat.  Just the right size for lunch too.  I really enjoy the fried rice.  It has a mix of vegetable in it and a delicious brown sauce."}
{"text":"The food is the definition of average, lacking any real flavor. The real deciding factor for two stars was the wait. It wasn't busy at all but took at least 15 minutes to get the food. If the wait time gets fixed I may come back. 15 minutes for average good is a no go"}
{"text":"Unreal no Mac salads with the plates been eating here since it opens no more jfjfjejdjdkddjdhfbjfjdjrjrfjjfifjfbfjrifjfbdbendjdjdjfbrnrjdjdjrbdjdjrjejejririrjrididjrjrjfjrjrbrjrjrjfjr"}
{"text":"Always good food. Ownership is very involved. Clean, friendly staff, most importantly consistent."}
{"text":"i love eating here because the spicy chicken is the bomb..whether you get a plate or salad its so tasty. i also love the dressing that they use for the salad delish."}
{"text":"I spoke with the owner of this location. He tried to bully me into changing my YELP review. And the fact that he flagged my review shows that he can't take the TRUTH! You can't bully me into changing my review that was truthful. You called my husband and I a liar, I will never support your business. You are the reason your location has such awful reviews! The fact is we received AWFUL SERVICE!!! And the response we received from the owner was AWFUL!!! I will not support this business with their AWFUL customer service!!!!!!!! I will take my money across the street to PANDA!!!!!!  Update: Sure, you update your review Dean, I already contacted you and you were rude and disrespectful. You didn't apologize you accused me of working for Panda. So keep your fake \"contact me\" I already did and all we got was anger from you. You spent the whole conversation talking about Panda instead of focusing on your store issues. If the foundation is shaky the house will fall down. You're the foundation of that business...i.e. bad customer service, bad management!"}
{"text":"Loved the food today...they cooked just as I asked. Very friendly too. Yummy good ;)"}
{"text":"don't misunderstand me, this, It is not a five star restaurant, however it is perfect for exactly what it needs to do. Food is quick, consistent, and place is always clean. I eat here 3-5 times per week. Always get the same great service and identical quality food."}
{"text":"It really shouldnt take 25 minutes to get food without a big crowd. Maybe 4 others in lobby"}
{"text":"First off I'm at the venue and the only madness thus far has been how much I have paid for sub-par Japanese styled food (kyoto bowl is much better than this place).  I'm not sure how to continue this review, other than...I'm not impressed. And for those of you who claim this place is 'amazing' ... I suspect you have no taste buds or are used to eating feces. Lets talk food...I ordered something they called Chicken Katsu...I am familiar with this dish, and I got served was dried out deeply fried chicken. Plus, I had to ask for my side green salad and Katsu sauce, which they neglected to serve with my order. For three people (lunch), $40.44 was a bit enraging. I will never come back to this eatery for all madness sakes.  Just think panda express meets smashburger in east Mesa and serves teriyaki. This place sucks! Save your self the trouble and go to Panda Express or whatever they have at the mall...I actually would like a refund of my cash. Done."}
{"text":"Lunch hour on a Monday afternoon.  Typical asian fast food.  Although I don't think I can really call it \"fast\" since I felt like I waited a while (15 mins) for my food.   Ordered the orange chicken bowl with white rice ($6.99) and my friend got the spicy chicken and beef combo plate ($8.50).   -- The orange chicken had a good, crispy and evenly glazed coating - better than Panda Express' orange chicken.   -- The cashier said the spicy chicken and beef were \"really spicy.\"  Of course whenever they say that the dish is not spicy at all.  Which was exactly the case when I tried the combo plate.  I am super weaksauce with spicy things and this dish was NOT SPICY at allll.  Would only come here if my primero lunch spot is closed -- which is Exactly what happened!  Wanted to go to 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate but it was CLOSED :(   Had to settle for Teriyaki Madness instead.  Overall: - slowish service - decent size meal portion - $1 extra for veggies with your meal (frowny face) - spicy dishes are NOT spicy"}
{"text":"Wait time is long, both for pick up and to dine in. The food is tasty and the establishment is usually clean! Customer service is decent, not the best. The sport games are always on and there's tasty fountain drinks to drink from.  No wifi that I could find. No bike rack. No outside dining area. Good thing is, parking is usually easy and it's in a private lot. Location is easy to find as well. Food quality is good and always taste right, hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!! Over priced and the food was horrible. I wish i had gone to L & L s instead. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Getting back into Vegas yesterday and The family and I were starving!! Kisha wanted something healthier, and fast, which as you all know rules out a ton of choices. I jumped on Yelp and found this gem...Teriyaki Madness....where have you been all my life???  I've driven by this place tons of times and never even noticed...I've gotten doughnuts from Pinkbox and never batted an eye...shame on me!!! Yelpers hit it on the head. The food here is awesome!! I ordered the Chicken Katsu, Kisha and Kylie went with Teriyaki Chicken and Chase had the Orange Chicken.  You know a place is good when no one touches their phone and all talking ceases for minutes. The Katsu was bomb!!! Super crispy on the outside, and hot, juicy and flavorful. The steed rice and Stir Fry Veggies that came with it were equally awesome. I tried some of the Teriyaki Chicken as well and it was delish.  The prices were reasonable and you get what you pay for and then some. Serving size was well worth the $8 and change I paid. Will I become a regular here? Most definitely!"}
{"text":"Don't know if the food is pre-cooked but there wasn't much noise coming from the kitchen when about three orders went in. I think I'll just keep going to the one on Craig."}
{"text":"Second visit here, I was willing to give this place another try since the first visit was pretty bad. Teryaki sauce was ok, nothing great, chicken meat was good. But the rice was watered down. I don't think it was cooked all the way. Wait time is terrible. I even called ahead and I still couldn't get it quickly. Menu is small, but I can't buy macaroni salad on the side? It has to be with the plate meal?? Prices are a little high. But the biggest reason I won't go back is the lady with star tattoos on her neck that works there. She was odd. Very odd."}
{"text":"Terrible, flavorless. I had the orange chicken bowl with veggies, it was terrible . My husband has the beef teriyaki plate, also bad . Save your money. Even the ice tea was bad. So disappointed ."}
{"text":"Went in to buy a couple of meals and come to find out they have no noodles to make Yakisoba. That kind of ruined the night as we were planning on getting that. The staff was nice but it was a huge disappointment. Don't understand how you run out of ingredients on a dish you make a lot of."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout food/delivery through uber eats here and we were so impressed with the quality of the food we wanted to leave a good review before we even finished dinner. It was quick, delicious, big portions for the money, fresh and high quality. Definitely recommend. We will be eating here again!!"}
{"text":"A good quick spot for take out.  The prices are very reasonable.  The orange chicken is the best.  The teriyaki chicken is ok.  You can't go wrong with ordering the noddles, vegetables, or a chicken egg roll.  Matter of fact, I might just go back and order that egg roll only because it was pretty darn good.  A good lunch spot to keep in mind!"}
{"text":"The worst. The cashier, a lady , was sooooooo rude. I told her I've never been there before and I asked her how it worked. She gives me the nastiest attitude and then tell me how it works all while still giving attitude. Then she asked if I wanted any extra sauce , I couldn't hear her over the music which was very explicit for a place or work. She then repeats it very slow as if I was stupid or something. Never going back to this location"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times and the first time wasn't as great. My rice was undercooked the first time around but I gave this place a try again, and it was great. My fiancè ordered the Chicken Katsu and I ordered the Chicken Teryaki, we did ask for double rice instead of having the steamed veggies, and they were able to do that for us. We. Also added in their dumplings and a drink, which made our total come out to about $24. If you dine in the drinks are free refills and there are soy sauces conveniently placed on the tables for you. The taste is good but portioning is more on the smaller side. This location is clean and big in my opinion versus the other locations."}
{"text":"Exactly as expected. Food was good and service was on point. The veggie bowls with noodles and the chicken teriyaki bowls have good flavor."}
{"text":"One of the best and healthiest fast food options available. The chicken and vegetable teriyaki bowls are yummy and the service is always fast and friendly"}
{"text":"When you place a phone order, pay, tip, and wait for your order because it's not finished... THEN the girl at the register takes more orders in a row, and the people that came in after you (4 of them) yes I counted, get their food... Never again..."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.   They forgot to include Marconi salad so when I told the cashier, he had to go to the back.  The others cooking behind him didn't seem to be cross-trained since they didn't step-in to help the customers behind me in line.  The atmosphere was good.  We ate outside  since it was too hot inside though.  I didn't feel that the food was memorable.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and ordered the orange chicken bowl. Loved it! Good food!!! Clean fast service!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here last night for the first time- my first time at any Teriyaki Madness in fact.   I ordered the spicy chicken with brown rice and vegetables and was very surprised at how good it was. Very tasty IMO. I'll definitely be back to get this again as well as try some of the other bowls.  The restaurant was very clean and the service was fast and friendly.  My bowl was about $8.50 after tax. Maybe a little bit high for me, but you do get a generous portion of meat- more than the Panda. Plus as I said it's fresh made flame grilled chicken ( I think) which was very tasty.  The only gripe I can come up with was the food was almost too salty. If you add any soy sauce the salt level goes over the top. If you're salt sensitive or on a salt restricted diet this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Yum! For a chain teriyaki joint, it exceeded my expectations. I went for the spicy chicken and was surprised by the flavor and quality. Nice big chunks of chicken. No little nibblets in this bowl! This place reminds me of a better version of Flame Broiler. Same pricing, but bigger portions. Lots of customizable options to satisfy every craving."}
{"text":"Good food for a quick Asian fix.  However, the prices are a bit higher than more authentic places that aren't \"commercialized\".  Normally a 2 1/2 to 3 stars place at best, but because my order called in prior to arriving was botched due to a tight schedule to catch a red eye to Philly, I took 1/2-1 star away.  Normally I wouldn't say anything, but the way it was handled by the cashiers, left me feeling that it happens more often than not.  With that said, the cashier did give me a 10% discount.  But it's never about the money.  Something to keep in mind \"Madness\"."}
{"text":"The salmon bowl was so good and I added the veggies with it and had brown rice. The teriyaki sauce was just right, not too salty. I also added a side of the shrimp tempura, and they were good as well. Didnt really care for the dipping sauce that it came with. It was like a really thin watered down teriyaki tasting sauce. It wasn't horrible, but I would have preferred a thicker textured sauce for dipping. I'll probably try steak or chicken next time."}
{"text":"You can find cheaper places than this place. But the taste of the food is really good even after paying twice the price."}
{"text":"Terrible! The Driest Chicken Ever! Ordered Extra Teriyaki to be Applied to my Bowl and not a Drop! So I Asked for More That I paid for Extra and They Give Me One of Their Smallest Containers about 1/4 Full. Needless to Say, 1st and Last Time for This Place! Pandas Chicken is Far Superior and Consistent."}
{"text":"Ordered this the other night, thought the chicken tasted weird, ended up getting crazy food poisoning from this place. DO NOT order anything from here"}
{"text":"I feel like it's a hit or miss with Chinese fast food. Some days the food is amazing and some days I wish I threw my order directly in the trash. I had one order that everything was burnt. Staff isn't the friendliest at this location but the service is always quick. And $8 a pop for a bowl is pretty unreasonable."}
{"text":"I love me some Teriyaki Madness! Seriously, I can't get enough of their Spicy Tofu Teriyaki Bowl ($6.99).  The portions are plentiful and the yum factor packs a punch. They're not stingy on their tofu portions either. The tofu is cooked just how I like it and the white rice is always fluffy and moist. I get the spiciest level available, but it's not overpowering or anything (just enough to make my nose runny lol). It's an extra $0.50 to add some \"Spicy\", but it's so worth it! I also like that you can customize your bowl - you can choose whether you want brown or white rice, veggies or no, etc. The veggies are meh so usually I just get my bowl with rice.   The restaurant area is clean and the average wait time is about 5 minutes. They bring your order to the table. Their house teriyaki sauce is delicious! I think I deplete half a bottle on each visit. There's soy sauce and Sriracha  on each table as well.   Teriyaki Madness is pretty much my go-to fast food joint. I always get coupons in the mail for them in addition to text offers, so it's reasonable to eat here! On my last visit, a meal for two came to $14.25 after a 20% Off text coupon."}
{"text":"I love teriyaki bowls ! I seen the sign off the freeway, i had to stop by and check it out. I fell in love with the noodles and the spicy chicken teriyaki bowl!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness is a great place to get a fast and yummy lunch or snack. I had the teriyaki chicken bowl with rice. Very simple, yet very good. Also, keep an eye out for the coupon mailings, it was buy one get one free! One extra plus: they have Pepsi products, so I could enjoy my delicious Mt. Dew!"}
{"text":"Cashier was friendly. I asked how the spicey chicken is she said it's her favorite so I ordered that and waited...waited...waited. then I noticed other people waiting. It was busy but not slammed 20-25 people in the restaurant . Orders were coming out slow. 1230 on a monday. Then a guy that came in way after me gets his food before me that irked me but mine came out 1 min later but still. The spicey chicken was good. They lost a star or 2 for the wait but maybe they earn it back my next visit. A couple more things I want to try on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of months ago...and it wasn't bad! The people were SUPER nice and GREAT service. I ordered a Teriyaki chicken bowl since it seemed like the norm. It was yummy! It was made to order and the chicken had great flavor! i will go back!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The employees were very rude and one employee was very creepy and kept starring at my friend and I. I felt so uncomfortable there, never going back again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few months now. It's not amazing, but it's fast, consistent and pretty good. The service has always been really good...for ME. I just get rice, chicken, and veggies. Pretty simple.  I was all ready to come and leave them four stars, but I did witness one of the cashiers literally trying to FIGHT a customer on one of my visits. In all fairness, the customer was being very rude, but the female cashier escalated things by coming out from behind the counter and got in her face, yelling at her to \"give her a reason\", then stormed out and said that she quit. The funny thing was all the customers rallied behind the cashier and told the rude female customer to leave. In all fairness, I don't think I could take a whole lot of crap off of someone at a job I was making minimum wage at either. So...I expected her to be gone, but she still works there!  Shut your mouth and eat your food and we won't have a problem, got it? These cashiers don't get paid enough to take your BS!"}
{"text":"Can't review the food, but walked in saw the dirty crew, no smiles, no hello, sloppy, nobody even looked at me. Poor management. Walked out."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken is good, but service is somewhat lacking.  The staff could use a bit more training and perhaps prioritize in-person customers over online orders. I shouldn't have to wait 5 solid minutes in an empty restaurant just to place an order."}
{"text":"Great food that fills you up! I have ordered the grilled chicken bowl and the spicy beef noodle bowl. Always delicious! Great prices, too."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened from July when we first tried it to now... quality seems to be an issue with this location... noodles were soggy, chicken was dry and burnt. Their teriyaki on the meat was not the same as the teriyaki that came on the side... the mac salad had sooo much pepper I couldn't eat it.. I doubt we come back at this point..."}
{"text":"We came on Sunday afternoon and ordered the chicken katsu bowl and the spicy chicken teriyaki plate for 16.  - Perfect intensity of spice! Not too hot where you'll be trying to calm the flame in your mouth with a drink. - Nice crisp of chicken katsu. Not too breaded and oily like L&Ls. - Kikkoman spicy teriyaki marinade fail. I love the marinade bc I use it myself. It Pretty much tastes the same.  - A bit expensive. Expected. franchise prices. Should be 4 bucks for a bowl and 6 for the plate.  - Horrible Mac salad. I thought this place is Japanese?  - I'd opt for island flavor just a mile away."}
{"text":"This place is the most consistent quality food in town. They have never once disappointed me!! Spicy orange chicken noodle plate is big enough for two meals or to split with someone else unless one of you is a horse! The best part about it is if you call your \"home base\" TM they recognize your number and have your regular order saved and ready to make!! Awesome awesome awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered conveniently online and went to pick it up. The gentleman that brought me my food went over my order with me. I guess I accidentally ordered one spicy. He was so nice and went and remade my order with a big smile on his face. Thank you for the great service I will be returning."}
{"text":"I always used to go to Teriyaki madness was amazing .decided to go there for lunch today and I found out the crab Rangoon's  they changed were so amazing ... they replaced it with crap .....and the potstickers they changed were so dry and crappy and this place isn't cheap ..... Looks like the food quality is going down .... Such a shame"}
{"text":"When we first walked in the food smelled good, but that was it. We arrived at 8pm and it took an hour for our food to get served. We should of known something was up, there were about 8 tables with people and no food. Only one table had food served to them. During the next hour, people complained about the wait and some requested refunds. There was even a couple who came in ordered their food sat down, then heard everyone complaining and got up and walked right back to the casher and demanded their money back, The other issues you have to wait for your food and during this time you cant use the restrooms since they are out of order. The soda area had ice over flowing on the floor and there were no napkins.  Was really surprise since this place had just opened. They have a problem.."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. . Went in at 10am.  The cooks had muscle shirts on ( tank tops )  They didn't greet me or acknowledge me until I said something. Then they told me I couldn't order because the cashier was not there. . After 25 minutes of waiting the cashier walks in. No hello, good morning, nothing.  She counts her drawer and rudely asks me if I wanted to order or not.  Worst customer service ever!  Will NOT be returning"}
{"text":"This place was amazing by far my favorite teriyaki restaurant I have ever been to. I am from out of town but I am always coming to Charlotte this place will be a must from now on"}
{"text":"I love this place, it has vegetarian options and that makes me a happy camper, if they had reward points I would have a ton haha. I always get the tofu bowl well done, and it's oh so tasty!!! The kitchen staff always get it right,  and Kami is the best person here, she is always cheerful and can multitask. I had to stop myself from eating here so much because I was up to 4 times a week, my belly oh no haha!! Please stop by and try!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Introduced this place to my family & now their hooked too. After I work out I love grabbing a healthy chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies for dinner :)"}
{"text":"They put very sparse sauce on the chicken breast , and there were very few veggies in all veggie bowl . Plus, 2 other customers and I all told the very sweet cashier that there was a very strong gas smell in the restaurant. They FINALLY opened the front door !"}
{"text":"Finally! We have one that's on our side of town! Food is good, service is super prompt, and we got our food pretty fast.   That green salad with the poppy seed dressing is yummmers! We have coupons too, my family and I will enjoy the short drive to this location especially after an all day hike!"}
{"text":"Manager Jose & most of the workers this evening seem to not appreciate patrons who live 1 block away and come in on average a MINIMUM of 1-2x a week. Truly disturbed by how I was treated on todays visit and will likely change dinner spots going forward to Cafe Rio which is almost as close and honestly has better food overall. Customer is not ALWAYS right however I certainly was today...."}
{"text":"This place does the trick.  The food is warm and delicious.  It seemed quick on a week night.  The service is not the friendliest but I guess I'm there to eat, not make friends lol.  I confess, I'm not much of a foodie, but if you're looking for something in the way of fine cuisine, you definitely won't find it here.  I'm putting this place in the lunch slash quick dinner rotation."}
{"text":"Okay, so I ate at this particular establishment two days in a row. Due to the fact I was very pleased with my first experience. The first day I had just the spicy chicken teriyaki. The second day I attempted to take a co- workers advice and this round wasn't as pleasing to my taste buds. I had the the spicy chicken and beef combo with white rice. The beef was a lil salty but edible and my chicken was a lil tough to the point where I hurt my tooth, but after that, I still smashed my meal. Which is why I still gave the rating above."}
{"text":"Similar to the other black and white zoo animal named chain, but they focus on a narrower menu here.  Atmosphere is nice, TVs with the sports channels are usually playing.  I've had the orange chicken and chicken teriyaki both with brown and white rice and vegetables.  I've never been disappointed by the food.  Price is slightly higher than the other chain but their food does not taste as oily as them either.  I like it"}
{"text":"Ono food.... just like home.. I have to say a great place and atmosphere.. Ill be back.."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was tasty and in good portion. Prices are definitely fair. Recommend this place to anyone looking for some good teriyaki at a decent price."}
{"text":"Terrible!!!!  Called the Sahara location approx. 9:15pm on 5/10-   Spoke to \"Annabell\" Asked if the Salmon bowel I got was GMO meat and she  told me YES!!!   Are you kidding me?  GMO Meat!!!! And nowhere is it stated, nor are they warning the public... DO NOT EAT GMO ANYTHING- IT WILL DESTROY your insides.  Do your research!!!  Also, this manager then hung up in my face- and would not answer the phone each time I thought we were disconnected.  I'M DONE!!!"}
{"text":"Fast & Friendly, not fancy ;however , great clean eats after the gym. Brown rice & All White Meat Chicken!"}
{"text":"Got the spicy chicken. Very very good. Vegetables were fresh and serving sizes were more than enough even for small leftovers.  Kids meals were good and portions perfect."}
{"text":"So just went here because I heard so many good things about them and wanted to try it myself... I've never been so disappointed! It was so bland and for a place that calls itself teriyaki madness I had no teriyaki sauce on my meat! Wth. Mind you I ordered salmon, which I give a lot of leniency to fish bc I know it's not a fine dining restaurant lol but it tasted like they boiled it in water and put it on a bed of cabbage no spices, no salt, no sauce, no TERIYAKI sauce! Ok so let's say the salmon doesn't come with it, I ordered the teriyaki chicken for my boyfriend with EXTRA teriyaki sauce.... We looked everywhere for the teriyaki sauce and concluded they ran out that day or something or the name is a prank like ha come think you're going to get ooey gooey yummy teriyaki sauce and SIKE. Long story short disappointed never coming back and ended up giving half of our plates to our dog.  ------ correction that was one time. I've been back (forcefully by friend) and it was actually decent lol maybe it was that day"}
{"text":"1st time trying it so far so good. They don't charge for the brown rice but I wish they had a meal where in you can have your food with drinks already. Drinks seem too pricey for $1.99 with just a regular sized cup. Employees were great, nice and approachable. Very clean, the food was good, you have a choice of sides and I got the stir fried vegetables which come in a separate box, 2 scoop of rice maybe cause I ordered the 2 protein plate. I wish they had steak instead of that what seemed to be a thin cut (not sure what it was) over all it was fairly good. I would come back if I were craving for teriyaki :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food.  Love their combo plates with noodles instead of rice.. yum!"}
{"text":"I've been in the Vegas area for 5 weeks and I've been to the restaurant 3 times. I've ordered the spicy chicken with vegetables a d the crab rangoons. I have 3 words for the food. De-lish-us. Delicious!!! I have found my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Great food at a fair price. Love the spicy chicken plate and the kids like the teriyaki chicken. Wish you could purchase additional sides, instead they up charge to change your rice to noodles and you get the same small amount."}
{"text":"This place is OK. I mean... I guess it is some rice, some cooked chicken, and some vegetables in a bowl with some teriyaki sauce. You cant really mess that up too badly, can you? Everything was fine. Sort of reminds me of the food you get from places in the mall. The prices are a bit high for the quality, but the guy who worked there was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've only been here once because I wasn't in love with the atmosphere.  Its a little confusing where you get your order and where the line is and where the menus are.  The food was pretty good, but the set up is strange and it always appears to be crowded.  Maybe once you are a regular it is more welcoming."}
{"text":"It is such a treat to have a healthy option for fast food so close to my house. Don't get me wrong, they have their share of unhealthy items on the menu, but at least you have the choice. My family and I have eaten here twice and both times we were impressed. We've tried:   Chicken Katsu- perfectly cooked, still tender and juicy on the inside yet crispy on the outside   Orange Chicken- delicious and so crispy when fresh   Fried Rice- not greasy at all and the veggies aren't overcooked!   Teriyaki Chicken- grilled to perfection   Yakisoba- wonderfully seasoned and generously portioned.   Spicy Chicken- Cooked to order (mild, medium or hot) grilled chicken in a spicy red sauce.   The icing on the cake is that fact that they have outstanding customer service. Before trying the spicy chicken, I was a bit skeptical. The cashier asked for a sample from the kitchen and allowed me to try it first. She also handed my daughter a free water cup when she found it too spicy for her taste buds. From the minute you put your order in, until you are served with your food, the staff make it their goal to see that you are happy.   Great food and great customer service are going to keep this place on my rotation."}
{"text":"I love this teriyaki madness! The other locations aren't as good as this one. I got the chicken teriyaki bowl with broccoli and brown rice. The price is decent for the portion you get. My only complaint is the cleanliness of the restaurant. It was hard to find a table to sit at that wasn't sticky from someone else's teriyaki sauce or had bits and pieces of food and trash. Other than that, I'll most likely be back to get that bowl again."}
{"text":"It's okay.  Only sweet dishes nothing salty.  They will not provide you ingredients lists or nutrition facts so don't bother if you need those.  Seems to be newbies working always.  Bulk of veggies is cabbage which is disappointing."}
{"text":"Teriaki madness in itself is yummy :) This particular location is fast and the staff are friendly.  I always get the kids bowl for my son, love how they chop up the chicken for the kiddos :)"}
{"text":"We always order the chicken breast bowl with rice and extra teriyaki drizzle. It has quickly become on of our favorite places, great prices great fresh food !"}
{"text":"Whenever i call an order in they always make sure my order is ready within a timely manner so i can just walk in and walk our. Definitely a cleanliness spot to eat and they make their food fresh and ready to go"}
{"text":"Man I miss Vegas. Just moved to the Bay area about a year ago and can't find anything close to the sauce they use on the spicy pork....  I CRAVE this sauce. And you MUST...I repeat....MUST get the gyoza....add a little sriracha in the dipping sauce and you're good to go!  I'm not giving it 5 stars because I agree with the comments regarding service. The owner is cool...but everyone else is either weird or boring.  I visit  T-mad everytime I come back \"home\" to Vegas because I'm that addicted...Maryland pkwy use to be my homebase location...but I've also frequently visited the Warm Springs/Durango and had great food and service there."}
{"text":"Update!  I love their salmon bowl!!!!! I don't know why but a sign in the restaurant says for a limited time.....NO!!! Keep it on the menu!!!  It is $7.99 and it is a great deal! I get brown rice so it's .50 extra...... This time we ate in and the food seems better there, plus we used a 20% coupon so the price was right. We will be back....."}
{"text":"Let's keep this short and sweet as this is a upper tier qsr (quick service restaurant)...  If you are looking for the Japanese/Hawaiian equivalent of Panda Express but 10x better...than this is the spot!   Spicy Chicken is an essential to get on any plate/bowl  Noodles is pretty good for the extra charge  Very fresh...good quality...excellent food...nuff said"}
{"text":"They are always fast and the place is spotless. I've never been into a teriyaki Restraunt that was so damm clean."}
{"text":"The food was great and I was given a card by a friend that gives me the second entrée free as long as I buy two drinks.  If you're in a hurry this is a great spot."}
{"text":"Just visited this location and noticed they have a C in their health department audit. I personally can't eat at places like this. I've been working in the food Industry for 22 years and to receive a C score in a restaurant is because something is wrong besides the fact of dirtiness. Didn't eat and asked for my money back. A place like this doesn't deserve no star (s) but in order to post this comment I was forced to rated it with at least one star."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating there, and I only went because they sent me a coupon in the mail.  I can say that it was exceptional though!  From Jordan who took my order (very informative and helpful with my questions) to the gentlemen who handed me my order.  And the food was excellent from start to finish. I have to say that I'm obsessed with the fork/chopsticks contraption! So while it's a bit pricey (but what isn't these days?!?!), I'll definitely go back.  It's a great place to eat that is Weight Watchers friendly and tastes great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The chicken and broccoli dish is simple, inexpensive and healthy!  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"The food here was terrible. Not exactly sure how this place got \"Fresh\" and \"Asian\" in their branding.  I've only gone once, and I'm afraid I will most likely not be returning because of a poor first impression.  A friend and I came here because we've heard several people give them a decent review.  We ordered a vegetarian and a chicken dish to go.  The chicken did not look nor taste fresh, and the vegetables were quite stale and bland to taste.  The teriyaki sauce was very watery.  After forcing ourselves to take a few more bites of our meals, we ended up throwing away our entrees."}
{"text":"had to redo my order 3 times and took nearly 30 minutes. definitely not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I got two plates. One spicy chicken teriyaki and one chicken teriyaki. Both with the famous Mac salad. With shrimp tempura. They were all delicious. The customer service was friendly and it was clean inside. I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"The best place for people who live healthy lifestyle  The taste of the chicken is SO flavorful and the place is super clean and friendly staff. I eat here at least once per week and I'm never disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Quick, simple and out the door. Just how I like it. Back when I lived in California I had a teriyaki spot that I constantly visited. It was the place I could go to for a quick and easy meal. I think I found that same kind of place here. Their prices are a little up there in terms of quick food, but it came out hot, juicy and flavorful so I'm not really complaining. Tucked inside a supermarket parking lot, this place gets pretty busy for such a small restaurant. I ordered two of the chicken teriyaki platters. It took about 10 or 12 minutes for the food to come out. When I got my order, I basically opened up both containers and drenched them in teriyaki sauce before leaving.  Who says you can't have enough sauce? Not me.  I initially came here due to the dining advantage app. It was buy one get one entrée free. And who doesn't love free stuff?"}
{"text":"My wife and I have come here on and off for a few years now. Here is my thoughts based off of my experiences  Restaurant itself was clean, there is a TV on which mostly plays Sports talk shows. There is plenty of seating available and we have never had to wait for a seat.   Service is pretty quick, we ver early have to wait. The portions are big enough were my wife and I can share a entree with a small appetizer and I always add a small salad because honestly the dressing they give you is AWESOME!!!!!  The staff is always pretty friendly and seem to be very efficient. When you food is brought to the table, its hot and always tasty.   In my opinion,  a great place to catch a fairly healthy meal after a workout at LVAC."}
{"text":"I love a good teriyaki chicken bowl.  Got an excellent deal on groupon for 2 bowls for $10.  I had the spicy teriyaki chicken.  It wasn't that spicy, but it had good flavor.  For healthier options, you can choose brown rice or just veggies.  It was a good portion of food, so I ate half & saved the rest for later.  I can't wait until later.  I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu was awesome! Yakisoba was good Teriyaki Chicken was yummy! Macaroni not so good:(. Has no taste to it."}
{"text":"Good food when you finally get it. Customer service is garbage. Don't bring out food in order"}
{"text":"before today, i probably would've rated higher. the food here (this location specifically) is always delicious and well proportioned. some days the staff is extra friendly and other days they're just there to get paid and not worry about customer service. i generally order the yakisoba noodles + a protein, depending who's there, i'll either pick up my food and it's in a small container when the menu board clearly says \"SERVED IN OUR LARGE BOWL\". this has happened to me about 3x now. today, i ordered the yaki noodles, added beef and tofu (veggies included). this was a phone order for pick up. when i finally look at my bowl, there's literally 3 strips of beef and probably 2 or 3 sorry bits of beef floating around the bottom.. so basically i was charged for something i didn't really receive. that's why i'm rating 2 stars just based on the inconsistent serving size of the bowl and the lack of ingredient in my recent order. however, because the food is delicious and conveniently located, i most likely will continue to order from here but i'll probably be checking my food before i leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"It was delicious! I had the teriyaki chicken and my husband had the spicy teriyaki beef. He said it was the best bowl he's ever had!  We will definitely be back! Hopefully the new management doesn't change the recipe!"}
{"text":"The food was incredibly fresh and the dining room was clean. The very brief interaction I had with Janet was pleasant. She was genuinely sweet and smiled a lot, which is uncommon in the service industry. Ill definitely make my way back."}
{"text":"I actually didn't have a single issue here! The Lady and I arrived about an hour before they closed on a Tuesday night, where the environment was quiet, but there were a couple people hanging around eating and the kitchen was working. Good sign. Up to the counter, ordered the spicy chicken, brown rice, and stir fried veggies for take out. A bit on the pricier side (I think around $9.40), but I was hungry and more than willing to pay for what sounded like good ingredients. I appreciated that they had different sizes, and calorie counts for each meal, helps you try to make healthy choices!  I sat down and waited for the food to come, and you gotta admire all of the punchy, funny signs everywhere. Some are informative (telling you about health benefits of all the veggies in their mix), and some are just punny. Which I appreciate much more than my other half... but she'll get there :)  Anyways, food comes out in less than 10 minutes in a bowl with a little container of teryaki sauce. Take it home, it's still piping hot and looks delicious. Pour sauce. Taste: I really dig this. There were tons of veggies, the chicken was cooked well (unlike the experience that several reviewers have had), the taste was GREAT. There was a ton of food, which I devoured because I have no self control.  Definitely adding this as a quick dinner option - and I love that they have vegetarian options as well so that The Lady can feast with me! I'm glad this has come to metropolitan, it's nice to have some other fast semi-healthy options other than Zoe's!"}
{"text":"I order on my drive over and it's always ready or with minimal wait time . It's hot, fresh and always delicious ."}
{"text":"It was okay.  I ordered chicken breast spicy teriyaki with fried rice.    1.  It was slower then I thought it should be.  There was 5 people in the place total besides the staff and it took us close to 15 minutes to get our food.  2.  The signage says Quality meats Perfectly grilled. It was more like Quality meat grilled to death!  I understand serving under cooked chicken is a bad thing.  But Serving dried Sonoran desert over cooked road runner doesn't bode well either.  3.  I ordered spicy teriyaki.  it was all spice more like dried up sriracha sauce and no teriyaki.   I was excited to try it but the end result was disappointing."}
{"text":"Wow. Very quick and attentive! Tasty quick meals. And MEGA CLEAN!!!!! Muuuuch better then the Stephanie location (Which to me, is always dirty. Ick.) I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"We decided to get lunch take out from here and I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I ordered the chicken katsu/chicken teriyaki with rice combo and my boyfriend got the chicken katsu and beef teriyaki with rice combo plate. Each plate came with a choice of macaroni or green salad. We both wanted the salad.  I liked that they did not skimp on the rice, that part was definitely a plus for us. The chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki were very tasty but the chicken katsu was a little dry. I don't think I'll be ordering that again. And they used fresh crisp lettuce for the salad!  Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I love having a teriyaki place near me. Sometimes you just need teriyaki in your life to make thing's better. The place has a modern feel to it. The staff are friendly all the times I have gone. The food is made fast and it tastes good.  They do bowls and plates depending how hungry you are. For starters sometimes I get edamame or crab rangoons. Edamame is nothing special, just edamame haha. Crab rangoons are decent though I find hard replacements for the lovely rangoons I experienced at another place. I usually go extremely hungry so it's the combo plate. I go spicy teriyaki chicken with white rice and macaroni salad on the side. They can turn it up a notch if you want some extra heat but don't say I didn't warn you might regret it later haha.  I'm a fan of this place being close by and giving me hot and fast teriyaki cuisine at a decent price."}
{"text":"Don't worry about the customer service here, there isn't any. Food is alright, not great. There isn't much to say about this place other than I'm glad I didn't top preemptively, cause they don't deserve a tip. Manager should train employees better."}
{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki bowl couple weeks ago at the blue diamond location and was highly satisfied. At this location, I was quite disappoint. The chicken tasted weird. It had a strange flavor."}
{"text":"I can't believe I am finally getting around to writing a review of this place.  I met a friend here over Spring Break.  It is pretty far from where I live and there are other Teriyaki Madness Restaurants that are closer to my side of town.  But, it was a great drive on a beautiful day so I was able to take advantage of the weather and my car stereo.  It was easy to find and the parking was easy.  I hate it when I have to circle a parking lot to find a spot.    I walk in and see my friend then we headed up to the counter to order.  I had the low carb chicken bowl.  It was full of, obviously, chicken, broccoli and other veggies.  Everything was well cooked.  The broccoli was crisp, which I love.  I hate soggy veggies.  The place was no frills and comfortable.  The seating arrangements were nice.   It wasn't terribly busy when I got there but it did pick up before we left.  I usually come home with a doggy bag but it was easy to put everything down here.  Anyhow, this place gets my 4 stars because I can't really think of a negative thing about this place.  Would I come here again? Not this location as it is a long drive. But if I was in the area? Then Yes.  But, I will go to one of the other locations near home."}
{"text":"One of my fave lunch spots. Call in ahead before pick up to save time. For is always hot & fresh!"}
{"text":"Not something I would plan on returning to, but I can see how it would be nice on a road trip or for a quick bite. First up, the service here was very nice. I was not treated poorly at all, nor was the person I was with. The facility was spotless, one of the cleanest I've been to in a while. It has a lot of seating that can be good for small parties and a few areas great for larger parties. The music wasn't overbearing like it can be in some places that are trying for the trendy or modern feel.   The issue was the food. It was spectacularly bland. I had to douse my food in teriyaki sauce to even get an inkling of flavor. I will say that it did not make me sick, though, which was nice. They are good about not cross contaminating the food. We had both ordered the tofu dishes, so I could not say if the meat dishes are different from what we experienced.   Overall, I would not say this place is a strict \"no\" to the public. Try it, maybe it will be better for the next person or for those who do not share my diet. Just to summarize, the service was great, the place was clean, it had a nice location, but it needs to step it up on it's tofu game a little."}
{"text":"I repeat what someone else said: I am not impressed.  I had the chicken teriyaki, which came with a sad little iceberg lettuce salad and some glycerined pseudo-Italian-like dressing in a tiny plastic cup.  I was underwhelmed by the flavor of the chicken. The taste improved after I added what I assume is more teriyaki sauce (from another plastic cup) but still, so little flavor!  I won't be back.  An acquaintance of mine loves this place, though- says it's won the Best of Las Vegas award more than once.   Honestly, it seems any place can win that award."}
{"text":"Big fan of teriyaki maddens chicken Katsu and the spicy chicken bowls are delicious and healthy"}
{"text":"I am originally from Southern California and loved all the little teriyaki joints. So when I found a deal at Teriyaki Madness, I quickly snapped it up.  Last night we went.  The store was not very busy but was kinda loud inside.  It smelled great and my mouth was watering in an instant.  We went to the counter and ordered.  I had a beef/chicken  combo with rice and mixed veggies.  My wife a chicken plate with noodles.  When the food was delivered they brought a bowl for my wife and I got my food as ordered.  The chicken was pretty good, but the teriyaki sauce was very thick.  The beef, which I assume is cooked in the sauce was very sweet. VERY sweet.  I can't say I was dissapointed, but it was not as good as I expected.  I'll probably go back again, but will not order the beef."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I travel to Las Vegas often for business and I make sure that I stop in and get me a \"Spicy Chicken Bowl\" before I head back home.  The staff is usually friendly and the place is moderately busy.  I wish there was a Teriyaki Madness in San Diego, I would be their best fan.  ;)"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Terriyaki madness I had bad customer service. The second time was a great experience. The cashier was  super friendly. They really packed a lot of food in the container. And, even though it was the end of the night the macaroni salad tasted fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"The portions alone are worth 2 stars, the front end service was fine, the food tastes like frozen leftovers, skip or use the 20% off coupon n shock yourself."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after discovering that Flame Broiler closes at 7pm.  This place is open till 9:30. Cool.   Staff was helpful and friendly. Vibe was casual, laid back.   Ordered the Chicken Breast platter, veggies instead of rice and side of green salad.  Minus 1 star as chicken was slightly overdone, but not too bad. Just have pet peeve about chicken being on dry side. Veggies were average with moderate crunch and very small green salad.  This place is alright, but I prefer Flame Broiler."}
{"text":"Awesome food and clean place. But it's kinda expensive but I guess you get what you pay for. I love the spicy teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"Decent food (not great), but overpriced and service was awful.  Waitress brought someone else's order to us to ask if it was ours and accidentally spilled water all over us in the process.  We ordered macaroni with our meal and were told after the rest of our food arrived that it wasn't ready.  We said we'd wait for it.  After finishing the rest of our food we asked about the macaroni and they stated they realized they were out of macaroni and if we'd like salad instead.  We said no, but no compensation was offered for neglecting to give us the food we'd ordered.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love the food! Vanessa Sanchez always greets with a warm friendly smile to brighten the day"}
{"text":"Salmon bowl with brown rice was delish! Veggies nice and crunchy. The wait time is a little much and wished the salmon wasn't so dry. Overall good"}
{"text":"Came at 7pm on a Friday night for dinner.  Was told that it would be a 15 minute wait for white meat chicken and that they were out of everything else.  Don't go there if you actually want to eat."}
{"text":"I'm almost always not that harsh on places...but this one I'll write about. Not really impressed. It's good food. That's it. The cashier girl was young and not at all welcoming or nice. It was really cold in the restaurant. They have TVs. They have Sriracha Hot Sauce. Menu is simple. So, yeah. Nothing great, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the teriyaki chicken & rice bowl from here, I have never been disappointed with it. I do find the prices a tad bit high for what you get but the consistency of the food makes me want to continue to order from here."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to eat here since my first review, but the manager did message me to let me know that the veggies and brown rice are now included in the price.   Well, that's more like it! I'll reserve the last star for when I actually go back in for a second chance."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL. I ordered a door dash and they basically didn't place the order at all, acted rude and unprofessional to my door dasher and had no courtesy whatsoever when I tried to follow up. This place is the kind of establishment that would spit in your food based on what my dasher said and the way the spoke to me. Just got the food and it's literally trash. some overcooked, some undercooked, ALL cold and DISGUSTING. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. You will absolutely regret it."}
{"text":"Love that the food is always fresh. Sometimes the beef can be TOO smoky if that makes any sense. Kind of tasted like a cigarette.lol That isn't always the case though."}
{"text":"Went here because we had a coupon for buy one get one free with two drinks.  This is probably one of the better places I have had teriyaki, but still isn't as good as the places we used to frequent in the Seattle area.  I'd go back there again, but probably with another coupon."}
{"text":"Good food.  Fresh ingredients.  Friendly staff.  Worth paying a bit more for a healthier option than most fast food joints."}
{"text":"Awesome food that is always served hot and fresh. The workers are always patient and friendly. I love how they give you the sauces to go. This place is so much better than Panda Express."}
{"text":"Great food, good location! Only problem I have with this place is it takes FOREVER to get your food, even if u call ahead!! Prob get my food faster at a sit down restaurant"}
{"text":"Yakisoba beef, with loaded veg.  Takeout order, service pretty quick on a Friday evening, moderate traffic in and out."}
{"text":"This place reeks of chemicals and theyre blasting horrible Eminem music in the dining area. Employees walk in wearing plain clothes and walk straight into the kitchen where my food is being prepared.  Seems to be a bunch of thugs working here and talking trash in spanish about customers. Go elsewhere. Food was dry af."}
{"text":"Love teriyaki Madness!!! Spicy chicken bowl with noodles and veggies always a go to when im working long shifts."}
{"text":"A good, simple place to eat. A bit pricey, but decent portions are served here. Spicy or non spicy chicken or beef, always full of flavor with each bite. A Healthy alternative to Panda joints. With a drink you'll spend nearly 10 bucks, so my visits are ocassional."}
{"text":"This chain is the better version of Panda Express for sure. The thing about this one in particular is how slow it took to get my food. I was the only one there besides a couple already eating and it took a ridiculous amount of time. Although I could tell my food was just made once I got it. Also the portion sizes are ridiculous, a lot of bang for your buck here. Overall this specific TM is average."}
{"text":"Of all the Teriyaki Madness locations I've been too (like 3-4), this has been my favorite. I regular this place on my lunch breaks at work and every single time I've been there, the customer service was awesome. The people behind the counter are friendly and know what to ask you, as well as how to ask it. They also smile, which is a bonus. I hate when I go to food places and see people that look like they want to strangle somebody. Sad days.   If there aren't that many people, the transaction from ordering to getting your food is usually super fast and they are always willing to give you more of their delicious teriyaki sauce. I don't know what they put in that stuff, but gosh darn it, it's amazing. It does tend to get busy at around 12-1 p.m. though when most people have lunch. I haven't had anything on their menu that I didn't like, however, I can say, that their gyoza is misleading. It's more like a gyoza shaped eggroll then ACTUAL gyoza. Oh well, the little things.   All and all, love this location. The best in my opinion,. If you live on that side of town, go there. Be mad. T-Mad. :3"}
{"text":"This place is a god send for \"Chinese fast food.\" I've been to at least three locations and the atmosphere is always awesome. The customer service is pretty good and your food comes to you fast. I'm a HUGE fan of their spicey chicken bowl and dish out the extra 50 cents to get brown rice with it. It's not overly spicey and if you love love love Spidey food, just add saracha  to it for extra kick. There are bottles on all the tables.   Their teriyaki sauce is made there with their own recipe and is another reason I love the place. All and all I love the place. It's one of my \"go to\" places for lunch at work."}
{"text":"I am too not sure why the negative reviews but as always, everyone experiences things differently.  We were searching for a place to eat before going to Costco and decided to stop in.  Place was clean, employees greeted us.  The lady who helped us was really nice and offered a sample since it was our first time.  We ordered and it took probably 7-10 minutes for our food (didn't time it) but it wasn't a long wait.  Food was phenomenal!  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"So you guys allow your employees to smoke pot in the restrooms? About 6 foot tall skinny Hispanic kid wearing a hat in bathroom for a while comes out smells of weed. He's in uniform and math room was not clean. Toilet seat is falling off bathroom is just not sanitary. Food was the same as most just mediocre. May wanna not allow employees to smoke or drink on duty."}
{"text":"I'm from Portland and there's some places there I miss especially Mac salad that's good came here food was quick typical environment. Got the combo with Katsu teriyaki and. Brown rice with Mac salad and put a little teriyaki sauce on the Mac OMG so good!! You must try!  Will come back for the madness!"}
{"text":"Not too bad for some beef teriyaki. It was a little bit salty for me, but still satisfied my craving. The plate size was too big of a portion for just one person. The service was very quick. Kind of hard to believe this place is considered healthy..."}
{"text":"This place is a severe joke. I went there tonight, spent $20 on a meal that belonged to someone else, as I just assumed a restaurant would check the food prior to giving it to a customer for a to-go order. Not this place, the girls are more concerned with texting and chit-chatting with each other than listening to actual orders. And to top it off, they refused to provide me with a manager's name or contact information to address my complaint. AVOID Teriyaki Madness @ 8520 W. Warm Springs Rd., Ste. 102 Last Vegas, NV 89148 at all costs since they do not care about accuracy with orders, customer service and its crystal clear their management at that franchise location has no clue how to operate a business. Too bad, this place had promise prior to this experience, now I'll never return."}
{"text":"This place is so great for when u have that terikyaki craving. Actually makes me want to go and get a bowl now only if it was open lol  - over all great food!"}
{"text":"This was such a great dinner for my entire family! Something on the menu for everyone!  The little kids loved the chicken katsu! The new owners have done a great job with cleanliness and excellent service! Our tummies were full from delicious potstickers and large entrees!"}
{"text":"Good teriyaki bowls... One of many things I'm an expert at is chicken teriyaki and Teriyaki Madness makes good ones. Choose your meat/protein: I had chicken (dark). Choose a base: I had white rice.  Choose a side: I didnt want vegetables so I asked for just more rice. I just got a chicken bowl but if you order the larger size plate sides can be also be green salad or mac salad. Their other protein options are beef, spicy chicken, chicken breast only, orange chicken, chicken katsu or tofu. The other base options are brown rice, fried rice, veggies or noodles.  Service was friendly & it didnt take too long considering how busy they were during the Saturday lunch rush when I was there. They ask for your name when you order so just listen for it to be called. I ordered to eat in but was still given a nice, sturdy bowl worthy of take-out. It was the nice plastic kind with a snap lid. It was nice but I thought it was such a waste of plastic especially since I was eating in and all I got was the bowl. I was starved so there was not gonna be any leftovers for sure.   The chicken was good. It was cooked just right. With some char marks from the grill. I really liked it. There was a good amount & since I got dark meat, the chicken was indeed juicy & tasty. It was a pretty good teriyaki bowl. I recommend them if you are ever in North Las Vegas & looking for a decent teriyaki meal."}
{"text":"Great place! Second time there with the girlfriend. Clean, fast, nice environment and great food. \"Medium spicy\" isnt spicy at all and its expensive but the quality of the food service and environment makes up for it. Great job TM. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. Manager came to talk to us. Convenient location. Opening one by my house at pecos and market. Can't wait. Bringing the family here to try."}
{"text":"Beyond slow especially around lunch. Also if You have ever gotten sick it's because they don't wear gloves when they should and don't check meat temps. I've seen it while I was there and walked out."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It is fast and it is cheap!  The servings are very generous.  It is basic teriyaki stuff.    Not much to  say - It is a basic teriyaki place..."}
{"text":"Less than good here, not terrible, but I see no reason to come back.  Chicken yakisoba was really boring.  The chicken had zero flavor, it didn't taste seasoned at all or marinated.  It tasted like a plain grilled chicken thigh.  The noodles were lifeless, no flavor and mushy.  The dish had no flavor.  It was noodles, veg and chicken but nothing else.  Ordered an egg roll, it was mushy.  One bite and that was it.    Also, I guy in wheel chair had no place to sit.  This place has 4 rows of booths and no place for a wheel chair.  A little inconsiderate."}
{"text":"Spicy Chicken... Need I say more. The food is good. Price is reasonable. Staff is friendly. No real downside."}
{"text":"LOVE that I can call an order in and swing by on the way home to grab a at least semi healthy meal that we all enjoy.  Staff is always super friendly, service is fast what more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"I have been here about 2-3 times now. The first time was delivery and was an amazing experience. I liked the food and was very pleased with presentation and the amount of time it took to get get to us. The second was a dining in experience which was okay. The person taking out order just stared at me when I was looking over the menu. I asked \"what's the most popular thing?\" And continued to stare at me and laugh. So, I ordered the teriyaki chicken. The food was good and service was moderate. The third time was carry out. This is where they messed up. My meal did not come with something (the salad) that we ordered. We called and asked if we could have our money back and the response was \"we cannot do that, you need to come pick it up\". When we explained that it was about 15-20 minute drive they insisted that we pick it up and that we would not get a refund. It's not about the money, it's about the principal. So, we will not be coming back here until the customer service improves."}
{"text":"After working out I decided to try this place out for dinner.  I love chicken Teriyaki bowls and wanted to see how theirs is compared to other places around town.  The decor inside is nice but weird.  Feels enclosed and with the white and red, bright!  I don't know if others feel that way but I was just kind of weirded out when I walked in, but I am hungry!  I ordered up the bowl and sat down.  There was a lot of people sitting down waiting for food and than a lot of people showed up and were standing in line.  The tables and floor were not cleaned up.  They had one girl at the register and 2-3 in the back doing orders I am guessing.  I thought I would be there for awhile but it only took about 5-10 minutes for the food to come out.  I took it home and opened it up and it smelled good.  I tried the sauce and wasn't a huge fan of it.  I like the sweeter sauce better than this vinegar or whatever taste.  It wasn't horrible, just not my favorite.  Everything else in the bowl was cook perfectly, chicken, vege's and brown rice.    I will probably stop by again if I am craving a fix on my side of town but probably not a regular visitor."}
{"text":"This being my 1st time at a \"Teriyaki madness\" I came here assuming the bowls were small in proportion, but I was wrong. Plenty of places like this use tons of rice to fill the bowl, instead of the meat. Aloha kitchen is one of those places I'm talking about. I know because I eat there quite often since there's one close to my job. So as far as this place, I was surprised at this establishment. I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice, along with a single egg roll, and washed it down with a cold water. I was satisfied with the price. Around $7. Not too shabby. I will definitely be returning to this location since it's super close to my house, and the fact that it's a body builders type of meal."}
{"text":"When I lived in California my favorite thing to get at the Food Court was the Teriyaki Rice Bowl so I was definitely excited to see they opened one so close to my home.  Unfortunately the service and food did not live up to anything like I remembered.  Upon arriving there were only two tables dining in and no one at the counter. So, being my first time at this location I asked the girl at the counter a few questions. Unfortunately she could not have been any ruder.  A definite \"attitude\" and didn't appreciate the fact that I even disclosed I had never been.  With that said I decided to order a Chicken Egg Roll and a Chicken Teriyaki Plate with white rice and veggies.   It took well over 20 minutes to prepare my meal, which I was definitely surprised at.  So, after getting home I discovered that the Egg Roll was sitting in a pile of it's own grease. Wouldn't you think they would let the grease drain off before putting in a To Go bag, ugh!  As for Rice Bowl, the chicken was undercooked and the veggies were okay, some cooked better/too much while others still raw. Needless to say I was not impressed and definitely am not sure that I would return. I'd rather go to a Chinese/Hibachi restaurant that eat this again, or deal with the service."}
{"text":"I will never return. I had chicken that could have easily been mistaken for rubber. The sauce tasted like melted plastic. I was scared to eat it. I took a bite and left. I should've known by the terrible smell that hit me like a wall when I walked in. I will never recommend this place, not even to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice here.  Sometimes I don't want to eat the lunch I've brought to work, sometimes I don't have a lunch that I've brought to work, and sometimes my co-workers want to eat here, so TM to the rescue.  Customer service is always great and the food is out in a jiffy.  It's a simple dish, but it's satisfying, I get my protein, and it's better than greasy fast food."}
{"text":"I actually like the food here, but the past 3 times I've gone between 6:30-7:30 and they were out of chicken breast and spicy chicken there is only basically 2 other options at that point. Not to mention the restaurant maybe had 3 tables full each time. One time I get it ...they can have a random slammed dinner rush and if I showed up after  the dinner hour.  But a new place should've learned  the first time.  Not sure how you run out of chicken breast at the beginning of dinner hour  that many times. Poor purchasing and not learning from mistakes has me not wanting to go again in fear of wasting a other trip. It's a shame"}
{"text":"Disappointing!! Check your to go order before leaving!!!  They forgot to pack the chicken in my salad!!  So, that ruined my dinner and the experience. The manager offered to reduce my next purchase 30%.....really?  I had to get pushy to get a free replacement when I visit again. Not that I expect that to happen anytime soon :(. I'll be heading to Fix8 Cafe from now on.  Teriyaki Madness lost my loyalty by not responding well when confronted. Bummer!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place two times and both times it was really bad. Dried out teriyaki taste was not good. Staff didn't care employee reached over the counter to help him self to pop. I have never had bad teriyaki until this place omg."}
{"text":"Yumm! Yumm! Yumm! Did I say Yumm? We could eat here every day. Wish they had a lunch card program or something, lol."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first and last time. The food was all tasteless.  Chicken was OK but everything else was blah. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Amazing & Delicious... I love the teriyaki bowl with brown rice. It's super filling, and the teriyaki sauce is the best I've had here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I work very close to this location so I'm a regular here for lunch. Teriyaki madness is an Asian fusion/Japanese semi-fast food restaurant. Restaurant is mostly painted black/red/white which isn't the best combination of colors. That's the only bad thing I have to review. The employees at this location are top notch. Everyone is helpful and friendly. I'm on a low carb diet at the moment and this is a perfect location for me. At the moment I get the teriyaki chicken with no sauce and veggies instead of rice. This is very flavorful and healthy compared to other fast food places. My usual (when not on a low carb diet) here is 2 proteins plate with beef/chicken teriyaki with white rice and veggies. It's a huge plate of food and can be shared by 2 adults if you're not selfish. I love the pebble ice  from the ice dispenser because it's fun/easy to chew. The food comes in a container with a lid and after your meal, you can reuse the containers for something else. Overall, the workers here are very welcoming and this is a great spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Teriyaki Madness. I was very impressed with the laid back atmosphere of the restaurant. The staff were nice and friendly; and the restaurant was very decorated. It had a flat screen tv for people to watch sports while they ate. The food was delicious, having never been I went for the original teriyaki chicken plate with brown rice and mixed veggies. My food was fresh and very tasty!! They also have a coupon for buy one entree get one equal lesser value. :)"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken bowl is sooooooooooo addicting! For the price, I just wish it came with more veggies so I don't have to spend an extra $2 for a little side."}
{"text":"Still only three stars in my book but they have changed the saltiness of the spicy chicken.   This time around I really enjoyed it. It had a good amount of spice and there was enough sauce to coat my veggies lightly. Normally my bowl is full of water from the veggies but this time whoever was cooking knew how to steam veggies properly. Thank you!!   I always get a spicy chicken bowl with all veggies and this was the first time I didn't douce my meal in teriyaki sauce...the spicy sauce was that good.   As always, super convenient location. Great, attentive service, Super fast meal prep and decent, semi healthy \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"Food is good, but they always screw up your in some way.  This time I Disney get an egg roll I paid for.  Very aggravating!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. My husband absolutely swears by it, but I just cannot seem to like their food.  The first time I went I tried their chicken breast teriyaki bowl with white rice. I thought it would be a healthy alternative to dark meat.... The chicken was rubbery and the teriyaki sauce is something to be desired. I hated the macaroni salad - no flavor and it tasted as though they mayo was bad. I left after I tossed my entire plate of food.  The second time was only about a week later. The hubby wanted some madness so we went, and this time I ordered the beef teriyaki. *sigh* The teriyaki sauce had way too much anise in it - the whole dish tasted like black licorice (yuck!). The salad is simply iceberg lettuce with shaved carrots... (thinking - I should have gone to Ohana).  I could find $11 to spend elsewhere with better food. The service is ok, the people seem friendly enough, but the food just doesn't have the quality or taste I am looking for."}
{"text":"This place needs to learn the concept of build your own. They charge $1 extra to substitute noodles for rice. They charge $.50 if you ask them to make it spicy. They charge an extra few bucks if you want vegetables in your $8 rice bowl topped with some meat. A bowl of basically stir fry shouldn't cost upward of $10+.  I only went here because I work in this shopping center. The place is clean and the guy behind the counter is friendly, but I won't come back. I got the low-carb chicken dish and it was good, but it wasn't spicy, even though I was charged extra for asking it to be extra spicy (not a pepper in sight!) and I loaded it up with sriracha."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a simple and somewhat healthy substitute to fast food, this place will definitely do the trick. I have been there 5 times over the last month or so and I have gotten the spicy chicken plate each time. The spicy chicken is a great combination of sweet and spicy. The plate comes with a side salad, which is pretty bland. However, the salad dressing is very tasty."}
{"text":"I'll come here sometimes after work when I'm lazy to cook haha. I ordered the 2 protein plate with chicken katsu, chicken teriyaki, rice and veggies. Food is good and wait isn't too long. I've ordered a few times and I haven't been disappointed. I always try to beat traffic when I get off work if I know I'm going there since they close at 9pm. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good the restrooms were really clean. Food is kinda price. I havd teriyaki chicken bowl with white rice. Little portion of Chicken and very little sauce on it.Noodle were not my favorite.Employees were respectful."}
{"text":"Everything in the menu is delicious. Probably here once a week. I may have an addiction. Lol"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Very consistent great food large portions.... Friendly staff as well... Just wish owners would bring back punch cards because we eat here a ton!!!!"}
{"text":"I have NO CLUE why this place has 3stars!!!! There food is amazing... service is exceptional!!! Always super clean!! Even the hi chairs always clean!!! You know it's not many places you go and see employees smiling and you can tell they enjoy there job!!! Must be some great management!!!!  two thumps up TM see you all again real soon!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The 18 year old kid that took our order didn't give a crap that it took like 30 minutes for us to get our food. People that ordered multiple items after we ordered 2 items got their food before us, and had almost finished eating by the time I got upset enough to walk up and ask if our food was almost done... the kids response \"I don't know\" and nonchalantly walked over to where the food was being cooked and just fkn stood there looking at the cooks cooking... didn't say anything to me... just kept standing there... didn't apologize for the 30 minute wait. Nothing. Then as I was talking to my wife about it, he starts laughing and mumbling under his breath. I'll never be coming back here.   My first review was somehow removed... possibly by the owner... who knows... but I'm reposting this one. And I'll continue to repost if it continues to get removed."}
{"text":"Wish I could give negative stars...This place is a joke came in and they messed up not one but all three of my orders mixing up the wrong items with each of our plates. Wrong rice on one no veggies on another. I called the manager said he'd replace my order the next time I came in. Of course only offering to replace one meal. He said he would put my name on the board. I came in to redeem he argued with me about it. I didn't have a receipt I offered to show him the charge on my phone from my bank and because they asked if you want a copy of the receipt being green conscious I said no so now I'm the liar. He then said whats my name like I was supposed to know he never told me his name, he said tell them the manager said My name would be on the board. What a joke. Not sure where this guy learned to bE a manger. But being a manager most of my life I can say he's lacking. The customer is always right. Now I'm supposed to be happy with a 50% off and he threaten to call the police because I raised my voice. What a joke I hope the owners read these reviews as I had already sent an email to corporate when this first happened. Going to the top on this one. You poked the bear mr manager. Learn some skills. He also took his name tag off or didn't have one on to begin with. Not sure what your hiring process should is like but if he is an indication guess it's not a rigorous one."}
{"text":"I got some plates here today for my daughter, my brother and myself. Anyhow, since my company has a slow day I thought he let's try this place for lunch.   Umm Excuse me I had to choke on their DRY CHICKEN real quick.  I ordered the Chicken Breast and Even if it has zero sauce on it  I should not have to rethink if I am eating chicken or Jerky.   Tough, Dry , Rubbery and disgusting.  Their food is horrid, the noodles.. I mean I honestly do not understand the hype at all.   The first thing my kid said when she took a bite, omg isn't this that place mom? I said Samurai Sam's ... No honey this is different.  And she replies and disgusting.   Thanks for the huge waste of money, let your cooks in the kitchen know THEY HAVE ZERO BUSINESS COOKING CHICKEN!    Kudos to Adventurous eating!"}
{"text":"Pay attention to he stars they're low for a reason. Any time I've ever been desperate to give this place another shot I'm immediately met with regret. Food is never ready when I arrive after being called in 30 min ahead of arrival, chicken generally tastes gritty and crunchy, and I just don't understand why they are never consistent with the other Terriyaki Madness stores. If you're craving it that bad, you're better off going to another store."}
{"text":"A trusty place to eat for good teriyaki. Love the spicy chicken. The wife like being able to choose her veggies."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken plate with veggies was cooked just right wish i could've had more veggies but wasn't bad."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here for the first time after driving by here for ages and while the food was good (that's the only reason it's a 2 star review), the staff at this place needs to be talked to about their behavior. We politely told the girl at the counter that it was our first time here and she never once made any suggestions on the menu, then when we chose what to order, she read off the options for each item faster than ANYONE could comprehend, let alone someone here for their first time. Then while we were waiting for our order, we proceeded to hear one of the kitchen workers swear right in earshot of all the customers and when I gave her a dirty look, rather than apologize, all she says is \"oops.\" Food was decent and the place was clean, but I'll try another location before dealing with the employees at this place."}
{"text":"First off I'm a frequent customer at teriyaki Madness. I usually go to the one on Craig and commerce. I was around this side of town and decided to stop here. I ordered a bowl and got half the chicken& rice I usually do from the other location. The chicken was just thrown on top of the rice."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review for this place because it's been a while since my last one and I agree with most other people on here that the service is severely lacking.        Today, there was a girl at the counter who took my order.  The set up for their menu has recently changes and it threw me off a little bit.  I was feeling a bit adventurous and decided to get something ptjer than my usual. I asked the girl if the Plate came with Macaroni Salad and she said \"Yes\". So, I ordered the chicken katsu plate, she asked if I wanted white or brown rice, I said white rice of course. So I waited for my good and it too about 10 min for it to come out.  I didn't even check the order because I never had an issue with this place before. I got my good home and opened it up, no macaroni salad.  I was on my lunch hour and didn't have time to go back for the macaroni salad that she said came with the plate.   This place used to be my favorite place, and o used to come here once a week. But it just seems to have lost it's way recently."}
{"text":"One star for each time I threw up their chicken. But the food was delicious on the way down. Too bad they don't cook their food..."}
{"text":"I would say it is an average local chain take on pretty basic 'Asian' (some Japanese, some ABC etc.) dishes. I had the chicken katsu with stir fried veggies. The price is quite reasonable. I would go there if I was needing a quick bite and in the area, because I don't think the surrounding area has a particularly rich set of restaurants."}
{"text":"yummy in my tummy. wish there was a little more protein and little less rice, but if i ran a business, i'd probably do the same exact thing to keep my margins high. But I notice -_- haha"}
{"text":"Ok so I've lived in Vegas for about 2 months now. I totally fell in love with teriyaki madness. Food is amazing!!unfortunately service is very hit and miss. I probably eat here once a week and today I waited for almost 40 min for my food. People who ordered after me ate and left before my food even came out. When I went to tell the cashier she was annoyed and told me they didn't forget about me and my food jus wasn't ready yet. She didn't apologize until she brought my food out. And she forgot a side order and when I mentioned that she again got annoyed! The sad thing is I think she's the manager. Maybe she's having a bad day.. idk but the food is worth 5 stars but the service is 2 stars. I'll jus order to go from now on!"}
{"text":"Most delicious teriyaki ive ever had in my life and now theres finally a location close to home! Yay!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin, this place is INCREDIBLE. I've been coming here for six months and always love my food. I first ordered the spicy chicken bowl with brown rice, very lean and healthy! Another day I ordered fried orange chicken and fried rice, not so healthy but delicious!"}
{"text":"I like the teriyaki chicken but the service is terrible! We waited 45 minutes for our order to be ready- 1 teriyaki chicken and 1 orange chicken. Teenagers working with no adult in sight. SLOW!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here for a quick meal after a workout. The all veggie chicken bowl was good and not over done with teriyaki sauce. Only complaint was the veggies were not drained well so the bottom was a little soupy. If I had rice I'm sure it would have soked it up. Complimentary sriracha is always good in my book too. Good bowl for a good value."}
{"text":"I love this place. Except when I show up at 8:50 pm and they lock their doors. The hour clearly state open til 9  on Sundays. They saw me and never opened the door for me. It's a shame some employees  don't like to work!!! Too bad I didn't videotape them. You would've seen me trying to open the door many times and everybody just looking out me. I wonder what the owner what do you if he/she found out the employees are closing early."}
{"text":"Yum! Love their spicy chicken! Just the right amount of spice with a little kick.  When the husband and I are craving rice but don't want to cook, we come here. Seriously something about that spicy chicken is just amazing!  I deducted a star because the first time we came here my husband ordered the noodles and it was extremely bland and flavorless :( he ended up tossing it out and sharing my spicy chicken with me....and we've been hooked since!"}
{"text":"Great place! Fantastic tasty, hot food! The beautiful young lady who waited on us was super friendly and knowledgeable about the food! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The food was super good, I got the regular teriyaki bowl. However it just took way longer than expected."}
{"text":"First time eating at this location I ordered the spicy chicken with veggies and brown rice. Food came out fast and nice and pleasant employees will definitely come back next time I'm craving a chicken bowl."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and they will give you 10 percent off if you show your gym membership."}
{"text":"They served me half cooked chicken.  Need I say more?  I don't think there is any redemption from that."}
{"text":"Place is very very clean! People are very nice! Food is fresh! Food is good! Why only 2 stars? I ordered the veggie bowl on white rice, I got a drink and I got a small side of white rice for my boy! It was 14 bucks! Ouch! The amount of veggies was light! A few carrot strands some cabbage some zucchini and onions on a cup of white rice! 5 bucks at most! Now double snout if veggies and I could see 8 bucks for sure! The small white rice must have been 3 bucks which was about a 3rd of cup and a soft drink hey we know that's always a rip! But 14 bucks? It was so yummy I made the same exact thing at home almost everyday this week and haven't come close to spending 14 bucks total!"}
{"text":"We came to Teriyaki Madness for the first time on 3/23/2013. My first impression of the place was good it smells great even from the outside and the dining area is very clean. The only thing that was a bit awkward was the \"line area\" because at 3 people waiting to order the line was already to the door I'd hate to see what a busy day is like. The menu seemed fairly simple and straight forward you can get a bowl of rice (steamed, fried, brown)with your choice of meat and with veggies or a \"yakisoba\" basically noodles instead of rice veggies and your choice of meat.   We ordered the Chicken Katsu Plate, a Yakisoba shrimp and chicken plate, 1 vegetable eggroll an order of Shrimp Tempura (comes in a 4 or 6 option) and 2 drinks. The total came out to 31.92 which for teriyaki I thought was a bit pricey but the place was packed and it definitely seemed like it may be worth it. The one thing that did stand out to me about the ambiance was that it felt as if I was at a protein bar at an athletic club since everyone was in track suits, jump suits, or just plain gym attire. I wasn't sure if I was \"fit\" enough to b dining here lol.  The food did take a long time to come out and I noticed that if you order your food to go it seems to come out quicker than if you simply order to dine in. I saw at least 3-4 people that placed their orders after I placed mine and they were delivered their food before I had mine. It couldn't have been that my meal was that difficult to make as it seemed like they were handing out similar trays to what I received when my food finally arrived.   The cashier was kind enough to bring out the egg rolls and shrimp tempura order to the table and stated to us that the food would be out shortly. The food was ready about 3-4 minutes after the egg rolls came out and I went to pick the order up at the pickup window. The chicken katsu was good and tasted decent the sauce did have almost a hint of bbq ketchup id say which was quite delicious. The chicken katsu plate was fried chicken sauce and rice. The Yakisoba plate was a mixture of noodles with vegetables like broccoli cabbage and carrots. The chicken was tasteful and had a hint of char to it which was great. The shrimp on the other hand was chewy and was very very over cooked I felt as if I was chewing on a rubber eraser. The eggroll was great and the shrimp tempura was delicious.  Definitely was a great experience and will be making a prompt return. I will probably say \"NAY\" to the shrimp though."}
{"text":"I read the review about it being hot and HOT it was. Food was ehhh. Chicken is dark meat only and a little fatty. Veggies came out and mostly cabbage, shredded carrots and 1 piece of broccoli. Wasn't super impressed."}
{"text":"This is one of those random places that I crave constantly. I get the chicken breast with brown rice or sometimes mix it up with their noodles. You can add veggies, too. You can really create whatever you want with the meat, carb and veggie options-- a great place to suit numerous taste buds.   The meat is hot, the flavor is simple, fresh and the tangy teriyaki sauce is perfect.  The prices are terribly reasonable and they're quick, so it's perfect for lunch or grabbing dinner on the way home.   In fact, I think I'm going to go grab some lunch from them now...."}
{"text":"Love the food but not the service. I ordered my food and it was incomplete when I got home. NO, I'm not driving back 20 mins roundtrip to pick it up. The staff is unprofessional and same with manager. Next time, I'll drive to Silverado Ranch location."}
{"text":"This place is your typical Asian fast food spot. The food wasn't terrible, just nothing to crave everyday.  I ordered a kids teriyaki and an order of crab ragoons. The ragoons were not all that great and I seemed to find no crab while eating it. The teriyaki chick did taste pretty good, just wish there were more veggies. The service was fast, yet they were a little pricey for the type of fast food restaurant. I would go back again and post another review.  Pros: Fast service, Satisfies cravings  Cons: Little pricey for establishment"}
{"text":"I come here often. It's pretty good. It takes a while to get your food, but they of is good. It's a hit or miss sometimes with the grilled chicken sometimes I feel like it was cooked well and sometimes I question if it was cooked enough. Chicken shouldn't be pink. Other than that only happening about twice I like it."}
{"text":"THE BEST TERIYAKI PLACE EVER!!! The Teriyaki sauce is awesome. The meat is awesome. I have already tried the chicken (my favorite so far), the spicy chicken, the beef, the pork, and the yakisoba.....all are freakin' fabulous and tasty. The sesame seed dressing that comes with the side salad is to die for. It's super sweet. I will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"I went in there yesterday afternoon and let me just tell you. Everything was great. this girl named Brianna helped me out with my order since I never been here.She brought my food to my table. I got a spicy chicken plate the wife got a salmon bowl and i order a side of crab Rangoon..The food was excellent couldn't have been better. The place was clean even with all the busyness the 2 girls kept cleaning tables and keeping the place running. Over all will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"welp, here's my Yelp, first off I wouldn't have even bothered cept when I asked for 1/2 white and 1/2 brown with my combo protein to go order the woman said I couldn't have that? and couldn't or wouldn't explain..  maybe 8 patrons inside about a 6 minute wait time if that?  and honestly I can let that go but when she said she didn't know why the alarm went off, I let it go in the store but that's why we have yelp right? I felt that it was cuz I'm white? dunno really she wouldn't tell me?  anyways now that I am here and I got that off my chest my review is its expensive for teri, $12 for a combo.. a small shot of limp beef and a small shot of chicken, if you are thinking you will get a big meal for the extra charge not so, welp, maybe if you're not white?  dunno don't care won't be back..  not the type to just take my blanket and leave crying over the spilt milk, so here goes..  the chicken is good and tender, cooked how teri chick should be cooked, slightly burnt on 2 sides then slivered up, small portion, the beef appears to be boiled? it is tender and palatable even so.. no crispness or flame at all? small portion..  brown rice is soft and fluffy, large portion..  the best part of the meal IMHO is the so called salad, its more like a garnish, lol.. again tiny portion.. I got like 3 bites in a separate to go container, however it is cold crispy and fresh, perfect really..    the salad dressing, its the real deal, the kind that makes you go for teriyaki in the first place, you know the kind if you are a teriyaki connoisseur like myself.. its that creamy sweet sour style that you can eat a huge bowl of salad with, they gave me about 3/4 of an ounce in a separate to go container in the salad box which was plenty for the amount of salad... I like to put a little on my meat too its that good..  I gave it a 3 cuz they don't allow us to rate certain facets separately, so for the cost and not having pork and not allowing me to have half n half rice with ZERO explanation as to why, don't get me wrong I can handle a good dose of racism, your right, hate away, however you're going to have to have it all 100% if yer gonna to hate on me while charging me double...  :-)"}
{"text":"Solid and very consistent. This location is of my favorites and always seems to provide the best services of all TM's in town. Definitely not the cheapest in town but under 10 bucks for brown rice and a healthy serving of chicken breast? Yes please."}
{"text":"So we stopped in for a late lunch 3:30 and the staff is not very friendly did not give a receipt for our meals we ordered separately . The food is fine spicy chicken was good . But when I go to the bathroom and see they haven't cleaned all day that's just wrong! Don't put up a clean schedule if your not going to do it. Went back to the table and this couple rolls up , leaves there lite cigarette right by the door on the window . Very classy move if I say so my self . I'm thinking  it was the owner or the manager because the couple and their child walk around behind the counters and proceed to take money out of the registers . And than pack their stuff and leave . So if your concerned with hygiene and cleanliness I would pass this place up ."}
{"text":"I came across this place while visiting with my friend who goes to UNLV. I was a bit hungry. So I wanted teriyaki and I stopped in because it looked tasty. It was. However, the restaurant only served a teaspoon full of teriyaki sauce. The chicken tasted like chicken. But not chicken teriyaki. Bad choice on my part."}
{"text":"This place is mad. They served me a meal with a mini cup of roughly a teaspoon of teriyaki sauce. Mad"}
{"text":"Been curios about this place. Decided to call tonight and ask a few questions about the menu. Advertised as open until 10 called at 940 no answer. Ok maybe they are a bit busy. Gave it a few minutes and tried again. Just rings and rings no answer. If your open until 10 answer the phone to your potential customers."}
{"text":"I've been trying to find new places to try. I love teriyaki salmon. This place has got it for a limited time.  It was pretty good.  Not a  new favorite but I'll probably eat here again."}
{"text":"I would like to warn you not to order the salmon because it is a square piece of rubber! It is not edible I ordered it the other day and it was horrible. Do not waste your money! Go across the street to McDonald's or anywhere else but here!"}
{"text":"I have survived in Las Vegas for 8 years now and I finally came in to check out what Teriyaki madness is all about!  The first thing I noticed is the big Sriracha bottles on all of he tables, at that point I had a good feeling about the experience we were going to have.  My sweet hunk of love man had gotten a free bowl coupon for his birthday so it was an Awesome opportunity to come in and give it a whirl.  I decided on the Chicken Katsu bowl which is a Japanese breaded chicken deep-fried to a crispy golden, served with their signature katsu sauce.  My honey ordered the Spicy Chicken which is chicken teriyaki stir-fried in a hot & spicy sauce. He loves spicy so that for sure did the trick in the spicy and flavor department.  The food was fresh and tasty and they are nice sized bowls because I had to take half of mine home.  I noticed that the store is very clean, everything is wok cooked fresh and the quality is pretty decent. We enjoyed our meal and the unlimited self serve drink refills so we will be back for sure.  ********************************************************************************************* My only gripe is the grumpy guy with zero personality at the counter as he was a real joy kill. This place is too good to have a young guy behind the counter turning people off with his \" I hate my job and the world\" attitude. I will keep my fingers crossed until my next visit and hope he was just having a bad day. If I encounter him again and he is the same I will make sure to make note of his name and post it in my next review! *********************************************************************************************"}
{"text":"This location is by far the WORST I have ever visited! The service and wait is horrible, 25 minute wait for one chicken katsu bowl to go. The Cashier Maria M. was extremely RUDE.   I will never visit this store again, I have never been treated so poorly at an establishment in all my life.  I sent an email explaining to Corporate of my horrible experience, will find out if they care or not."}
{"text":"I think Teriyaki Madness normally has Yummy eats for sure! I really enjoy the Teriyaki beef bowls normally however my beef bowl today had hard grizzle. I took my order to go so I was screwed. They are super tasty and filling. I enjoy their thin noodles and sticky fried rice even though they were cock blocking on my order this time.   If you sign up for the Madness club you will get a FREE bowl voucher emailed to you for your Birthday along with other incentives!  Side Note- This location was not willing to do half rice/half noodles even if I paid extra. I didn't think that was cool considering the location on Decatur does allow.  The staff is not so friendly at this location either, zero enthusiasm or personality."}
{"text":"Not only is the food here great, the quality of meat and amazing teriyaki sauce is addicting! My husband and I drove off the strip to dine here and the food did not disappoint! Plus the owner of this location is hands on in helping to ensure the best costumer service is received from this location. I can not say enough great things about this place, I plan on visiting weekly!"}
{"text":"Normally I am a huge fan of teriyaki madness however not so much with this location. my husband and I have dined here often since moving to the south west side of town but we have found that the quality of their beef is not as great as at the Blue Diamond location. Our last two visits to this location left us unsatisfied with the food that we had ordered so we have stopped dinning here almost completely at this point. Instead we shell out a few extra bucks and frequent a similar establishment on the same corner. Im giving this 3 stars because the chicken is usually good and the price is resonable. Unfortunately for me though I'm a beef fan so the chicken being the only recommendable item doesn't do anything for me."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time because we received a coupon in the mail. When we walked in there was an interview being conducted. The person conducting the interview (we are assuming is the manager) was talking so loudly we could hear the entire thing no matter where we sat. He was asking some personal questions and talked about how, \"Training is only two days man you can do it, I mean come on? Come on?\" This was only part of it and didn't seem very professional. It made it hard to have a conversation. The employees working seemed almost scared... weird environment. When we asked questions about the menu we never really got a straight of helpful answer. Half way through the meal the \"manager\" pulled aside a guy who was being trained and started talking/yelling at the same volume about the different menu options. It just seems like there is a better way/place to handle this. The music was also not edited, we heard a few f words during our experience, not the most family friendly. The food was good but probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Finally, a medley of vegetables. For nine years all I've done is complain about shrimp sauce and sweet carrots. My friends and family are tired of my griping. I can finally shut up.   Not that Shrimp sauce and carrots haven't grown on me, I'm just a fella' that likes variety. I really like this place. It's a sure fire break from the norm, and I welcome the change. This isn't your typical southern hibachi/teriyaki. It truly is west coast style in essence. But what does that even mean?  Well first off, they don't have sweet carrots and shrimp sauce. If that's what you're looking for this isn't the place.  They don't just offer one type of vegetable; mushrooms or broccoli. If you order vegetables as a side, you'll get broccoli, shredded carrots, onions, cabbage and zucchini.  They offer teriyaki bowls, wth brown or white rice or noodles+ teriyaki sauce. You pick your meat, bulgogi style beef, spicy chicken, katsu chicken, tofu or regular chicken and a side.   Teriyaki sauce probably isn't any healthier than shrimp sauce, but hopefully all of the veggies balance it out?? They also offer macaroni salad - which I can only describe as a Hawaiian style? That's just okay, nothing special.   Regular chicken + white rice and veggies = winner in my book."}
{"text":"Never fail! Go to place to get simple but a really good meal. I love all the options but teriyaki salmon bowl is my favorite. This location is always busy but always clean and the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered some food through ubereats, the uber eats app listed the spicy chicken bowl as being served with Veggies, the first night I ordered received with Veggies, the second night received no veggies. I called the restaurant and told them of the error, they claimed the order did not come with veggies and put me on hold. After about 10 mins of being on hold I just decided to go to the store to show them my receipt. After showing them my receipt and proving that my order said veggies they basically said they didn't care, not their problem. They said I would have to deal with it with Uber and that it wasn't their problem. The girl pretended to go back and speak to a \"supervisor\" but came out and basically repeated that it wasn't their problem. I can understand that I may have to request any refunds through uber but the utter lack compassion and customer service in the face of a customer that paid two times the price for their food to be delivered and still had to drive to the restaurant to get their order, and the total dismissal that the issue may be on their end and not on the apps end.  After a while they finally offered to provide veggies but all in all a horrible customer service experience and attitude from the staff."}
{"text":"The noodles are sooo good, a side order is a perfect lunch. They are just a little slow, but I know that's because everything is cooked fresh to order."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. Beef teriyaki bowl was ok. Rice was saturated in sauce and beef was pretty fatty, but thankfully it was cut really thin so it wasn't that bad. Ok for quick meat/rice bowls on the go, I would say."}
{"text":"Don't recommend dry meat and rice that's not very fresh, but if you want a quick bite, that's what you'll get."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after driving by it a few times. It feels like a samurai sams as you enter and order. Everything seems to be cooked on the spot which is a good thing. Unfortunately when I got home the order was wrong and it tasted decent, nothing id write home about. The prices are pretty expensive too for just getting chicken and friend rice. Ill be skipping this place next time im hungry."}
{"text":"Teriyaki in a bowl ? quick order? SPICY chicken?   I'm sold, although how its right next to 24hour fitness throws me off a bit. But their meat is nicely marinated and cooked, along with veggies and an option of either white or brown rice, and even noodles!"}
{"text":"This place just seems ok to me. I really want to love it, but I don't"}
{"text":"Best location so far.  The manager during the day is top notch and really takes service to another level.  Always friendly, remembers my name and my order.  Really runs a great team. Even the bathrooms are kept nice and clean. Nice to have great service even when they are busy! 5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"You know what, it's just some simple good food. Nothing more and nothing less. Steamed veggies, grilled meat, and some plain rice or plain noodles. No sauce, just that. Something about it though is just really good. Would absolutely return, but the price could be a bit cheaper considering it's plain but then again it is a ton of food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for the first time. Will definitely go back. Had the Teriyaki chicken plate with rice, macaroni salad and added steamed veggies. Also the crab Rangoon. The Teriyaki sauce is practically to die for. OMG. Could eat it with a spoon. Chicken was nice and tender. The veggies were cooked perfectly, still had a bit of bite to them. I put just a touch of the Teriyaki sauce on them too, because I couldn't get enough of it, lol.   Crab Rangoon were very tasty. Preferred them plain than with the sauce, they were that good.   Only thing I didn't care for was the salad. It was just OK.   Service was very fast and friendly, and everything was correct with our order."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. The food was better than expected. They speak with everybody here to ensure you have a good experience. This was my first time, though I am at this plaza to charge my car often and I will be back."}
{"text":"I like Teriyaki Madness much better than other quick service Asian style places.   I received a birthday email for a free bowl so we went today to get it. I got a spicy chicken bowl with veggies and noodles. I had to add the teriyaki sauce which totally changed the flavor and made it more delicious.   The employee who took my order and brought the food was nice and I understood why they had to check my ID to make sure it was really close to my birthday.  Teriyaki Madness was my go to for lunch because of the vegetables and quality of the food. I'll definitely be back again when I'm craving Teriyaki Madness!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best teriyaki chicken I've ever tried. Every Time I go to Las Vegas I always go to this joint. The spicy chicken teriyaki and spicy edamame are both delicious!   It's affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place for fresh teriyaki meals!!!!!! I have been coming to teriyaki madness for over 2 years now. The food is delicious!!!!!! The portion are perfect wether is a bowl or a plate. Very fast and friendly services. I love to call to order my meals and just pick them up after about 10 minutes. Teriyaki Madness has never disappointed me! :)"}
{"text":"BEST teriyaki bowl EVER!!!! From the taste and food quality to the decor and atmosphere this location is the best location!   The taste and quality has always been the same, that is hard to find at other restaurants. The employees are so delightful, happy, cheerful and welcoming. Not many places have such happy people working.   The price is fair, I usually cannot finish my teriyaki bowl so I end up with left overs. I think 2 meals for under $10 is a pretty decent. They don't charge for extra sauces either, that is rare and very appreciated.   If you want a quick, healthy, fairly priced meal. Stop by teriyaki madness!! I guarantee you will not be disappointed in anything that you try.   Parking can be challenging to some.... It doesn't hurt to walk a little. Especially after indulging in some incredible food."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location for years because it is near my house & near the gym. So it is a great location, great service, great staff, & great food. I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food and customer service outweigh that.  It's a very clean establishment and one of the places I like to go to after a workout!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, tried the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was very good. Second time I tried the spicy chicken teriyaki, ordered it mild and it also very good. Healthy alternative to a burger and fries"}
{"text":"I've been to Teriyaki Madness a few times now and I really enjoy the food- I have stuck with the same order now each time- I enjoy the spicy chicken teriyaki bowl with white rice and veggies.  I have always had a great experience with the cashiers and the service has been friendly in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good solid teriyaki chicken bowls.  Nice portions, fresh veggies, and juicy chicken.  It's definitely a step up form Panda Express :) Only complaint is that for a semi-fast food place, it's kinda slow.  I'll have to try the spicy chicken next time!"}
{"text":"This review is purely for their chicken katsu bowl and service.  Service was quick and easy. They were pretty busy for the time we went in. But, they were fast and really friendly, so that's a plus! I got the chicken katsu bowl and it was just okay. The chicken to rice ratio was a little off (like a whole bunch of rice and some chicken) but that's okay, I don't eat much anyway. Thank goodness my friend wanted to eat some rice with his teriyaki chicken/vegetable bowl, otherwise there would have been so much rice left over.   I gave them 4 stars because of service quality. But other than that, I'd probably only be back if my friend wanted to grab some food or if I wanted to sneak him a meal that he likes for work. :)"}
{"text":"The spicy chicken bowl is fantastic. I just get the meat with brown rice."}
{"text":"Pricey but good. Sit down restaurant prices for take out quality food. It was about $25 for two people, which was two bowels and two sodas."}
{"text":"I almost always get the chicken katsu with white rice. Every now and then I will get the teriyaki chicken instead. The katsu this time was right on the border of almost too crispy where the chicken was dry.    It's pretty much Japanese fast food and is fine for lunch every now and then. Everything is made to order which is nice so expect to wait 5-10 minutes for your food."}
{"text":"Always good for a quick meal if I don't have the time to cook esp after I hit the gym."}
{"text":"Chicken is not the issue. Came here several times over the past two weeks but won't be coming back. They're employees were not well trained in customer service or how to make amends to errors that they make. I got screwed on an order that was their mistake and they did not make it right. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Very unorganized and takes forever to get your food. Been to other Teriyaki Madness locations and this is the worst one. They definitely need a new manager that actually knows how to run a business."}
{"text":"Great casual spot for hibachi style food. Had the spicy chicken bowl with just veggies and it had great flavor. They make their sauces in house. Ask for the shrimp sauce!"}
{"text":"Get the spicy chicken! Add the mac salad for incredible flavor. Service was really good and the place is very clean. The owner works here all of the time and is so friendly.   Great food and great service"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken with brown rice bowl was amazing! Grilled to order, super flavorful! The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the prices are kinda high. Up-charge for brown rice, up-charge for veggies etc. But it's really good food, so I'll be back anyway, just not as often probably."}
{"text":"This is a good distance from the strip, and probably not worth it unless you are really in the mood for chicken - which we were!  The spicy chicken is definitely spicy - lots of flavor in the sauce.  Service was great, prices were a little high for what you get.  Great for a quick meal, but probably not worth driving/paying for unless you are in the area for some other reason."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! The meals are perfect portion sizes to hit the spot. The food is healthy and delicious. Flavor is always consistent which is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly delicious!   My boyfriend and I came here to eat for our lunch break. It was definitely a good choice!   The cashiers were nice and the food got out in about 7-10 minutes. The bowls come with stir fried veggies. I ordered a beef bowl and a chicken teriyaki bowl.   The beef teriyaki bowl was pretty good! The veggies were cooked perfectly and I could tell that they were fresh. The beef tasted more like bulgogi though.  The chicken teriyaki was amazing! It's definitely worth every penny. The chicken was juicy and the sauce just tasted perfect!  I must admit, I was surprised!  It just expected another panda express kind of place (which I like) but it was much better.   Another upside was that the place was spotless so I feel a bit better about eating there.   The only downside was that the plates were $1-$2 just so that you could choose the side instead of getting rice? I didn't really understand that part. Maybe there's more meat too? I'll try it out next time.  No drink combos with the bowls and plates. Only for the kids menu."}
{"text":"Different from most of the reviews, I actually got pretty good service at this location. I work near by so it's a quick drive to this spot. Luckily I get a discount for being an employee near by.   I always tend to get the standard teriyaki bowl with veggies. My chicken was nice and juicy and the veggies pairs well with the meal. The rice is good. I always like to get extra teriyaki sauce and sriracha on the side. If you mix the teriyaki sauce and sriracha and pour it over the chicken, oh my gosh, it's delicious!   Definitely a great place for a quick lunch. I'd highly recommend and will definitely coming to this location more often."}
{"text":"This is a delicious and guilt free spot. Was craving a teriyaki chicken bowl and found this was nearby. I looked up the menu and noticed it wasn't too crazy calorie-wise and the prices were great.   Got a teriyaki chicken bowl with fried rice and veggies. Total was only $9 and change. So far so good. They make the food to order so it was very fresh, I like that. The employees also bring your food to you, even if it's to-go. All the employees are friendly and offer great suggestions.   So now the food, for one the portions are pretty large. I could barely finish the bowl, I couldn't imagine eating a whole plate haha. The chicken was tender and juicy, not over cooked and the veggies were perfectly cooked...not too crunchy, not too mushy. I enjoyed the flavor of the fried rice. Everything complimented each other.   This is place is fairly busy, especially at lunch time so I noticed a lot of people called ahead for their order or ordered online. Plenty of options if you want to get your food more quickly.   I'll be back for my next teriyaki bowl fix and will try the noodles."}
{"text":"I love their sauce! Last time I was here with my sister and it was great. This visit though, kinda dropping on the quality that I remember having before. I still will come back but maybe be a little more attentive to details."}
{"text":"Years later and I returned here for a quick dinner. The service and food has remained standard. Quickly prepared. Decent for a chain."}
{"text":"My go to food spot. Friendly staff. Always consistently awesome food. Spicy chicken is amazing.  This location is faster than others. Also like how they have the teriyaki sauce easily accessible for to go orders."}
{"text":"Disappointed by this place. The teriyaki sauce is so bad it is almost flavorless, thick, and has so smell to it. The rice was so bad too!  It was mushy and was stuck in big mushy lumps. It was the fried rice that I even paid extra for! It was clearly over cooked or something went very wrong. Veggies were ok but really had no seasoning. Sever with wayyy to much rice which sucked because the rice sucked. The chicken was ok but ruined by the thick flavorless sauce. Very heavy meal and I fell like crap now after eating it. For a place called teriyaki madness, the teriyaki was surely lacking."}
{"text":"Nice for a quick lunch and the menu is easy for first-timers to understand. The cashier was super friendly and helpful regarding the popular items and explaining the different Spice levels.   I ordered a kids rice bowl, which comes with a drink, because it's more than enough food to fill you up without giving you the \"itis\" should you have to return back to work. The food was meh but the portion size was great. All food is made to order, so you'll get your meal hot and fresh. I also like the fact that you can pick which vegetables you want to add/remove to the mix.   Hopefully as business picks up, WiFi can be added to encourage lunch meetings, as there is little service within the area in general.   I love the concept of this place and easy-to-order menu, so I will be back!"}
{"text":"New Location: beside Coldstone Ice Cream and McAlister's Deli First Visit/thoughts= similar to a Panda Express Lunch @ 12:45pm Parking lot- very congested due to all the restaurants in the same location Clean location, cashier and cooks were friendly You will have to wait for food to be prepared, so don't be in a hurry I ordered the 2 Protein Plate $11.00: teriyaki chicken- 8 cut pieces, tender  Orange chicken- 10 small pieces, flavor is ok fried rice- very dry, sauce included in bag helped a little bit veggies-mostly cabbage, steamed, no flavor  Pricey considering other places in the area for lunch.  I can get steak and shrimp at Toyama or almost 2 plates at House of Leng.  They need bigger Orange chicken pieces and better rice.  I will probably give them another try in a few months, since they just opened."}
{"text":"This is the best teriyaki bowl in Gilbert and the cashier was great sorry I forgot her name but she worked Thursday at 430 pm"}
{"text":"Ordered the terriaki chicks breast plate..the chicken was so tough..no char marks..looks and taste like boiled chicken.."}
{"text":"unreal good food. I tend to eat here as often as possible. Spicy chicken bowl, no veggies and white rice with extra meat. All of the appatisers are amazing also! try the shrimp if you can."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Customer service is superb and I recommend the spicy chicken to any first timers. It gets really busy at times but it's amazing. I love the varitey of food and how you can make a order that's specific to me! Great place"}
