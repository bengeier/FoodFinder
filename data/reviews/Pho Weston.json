{"text":"Been here a few times but seems like everytime I'm back, the name of the restaurant changes.  Regardless of what the restaurant is called, the food is always good here.  Service is nice and quick.  If you're in the Vaughan area, this is probably the best place to satisfy your pho craving.  Note, this place does not take any credit card but they do take debit card.  Cheers."}
{"text":"great food and reasonable prices. in fact i love the place. in my tio 5 pho places in vaughan. ive been here 3 times in the past week"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho spot I've been to in Vaughan so far. The pho is very good (tasty broth, fresh ingredients) and the service is fast. I also tried the chicken wings, they're on the salty side but I dip them in hot sauce and it evens it out. This will now be my go to spot in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Tried this place later in the evening one night on a mission for pho.  My daughter had the spicy seafood and I had the sliced beef.  Both were very tasty.  Very mom and pop feel and service.  It's not fancy, very basic tables and not where you'd take a first date for the impression factor, apart from the food.  Having said that, the food is worth coming for, and you get nice sized portions for what you pay.  A $7 bowl here is bigger than a lot of other places in the surrounding areas that charge almost double for a comparable amount.  A new regular go-to place!"}
{"text":"Pho is always good and super hot. My husband and I come here often. The place could use some TLC and they can start using trays to bring out the food instead of holding the bowls at the rim with their fingers, where it touches the food."}
{"text":"Decent pho, generous portions, cheap, quick service, lots of parking (this plaza is very quiet at night). So thankful we have this pho place in this area. I haven't tried other pho places in Vaughan, but I am pretty happy with this place for now. I will update my review after several visits."}
{"text":"Great food and large portions at a good price. The grilled dishes with rice or vermicelli are delicious and so is the rare beef pho. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been in twice and haven't had my socks knocked off by any dish yet. Service was quick and staff answered a few questions that a newbie amongst us asked. Restaurant was clean and fairly busy, so they must be doing something right...I just wasn't blown away by it."}
{"text":"This place is one of those hole in the wall hidden gems. The place itself isn't in the greatest shape as for what ever reason most ph贸 places aren't.  Chairs, tables, utensils, bathrooms, cleanliness is the reason this place is not a 5 star review.  Seems to be family owned and the staff are very polite, they remember you and your orders the next time you come in.   I have ordered there pork chops with rice (delicious) and a good portion. They're Rare beef and beef ball ph贸 which has a great broth.  My personal favourite is the H8 which is a spicy rare beef soup.  The flavour in this soup is amazing and I have it at least once a week.   Prices are what you expect Ph贸 to be.... cheap  In my personal top 3 ph贸 restaurants."}
{"text":"wifey and i too lazy too cook so we decided to go try one of the numerous pho/viet restaurants in our area....  that day was pho weston... both ordered a bowl of pho..  seemed generous with the noodles and meat standard pho..  broth was tasty but i felt \"thirsty\" driving home... sprouts + herbs seemed fresh and clean... no fresh chilis (didn't ask) but had some pickled chili that did the trick...  Nothing special... but probably come back again to try one of the rice dishes, vermicelli dishes or the bun bo hue.."}
{"text":"The best pho in town! I come here for pho, because it is consistently tasty. I especially like their special pho or rare beef pho. They seem to use high quality beef, so I don't need to try cutting all the fat parts out. I also tried various interesting drinks that they offer: Jackfruit smoothie, Peonywart juice, Dragonfruit juice; these stuff that you won't typically be able to get anywhere else. I wasn't a huge fan of these drinks but it was fun to try something new. They do not accept credit cards; only cash or debit."}
{"text":"Stick to the basic pho (and perhaps some of the bun) here. Menu list is short and nothing noteworthy outside these basic items. The pho is very good and served super hot and fresh. In the top 5 (not the 1st! calm down) pho around so far."}
{"text":"good pho place in vaughn! would love to come back again. I have tried the mixed fried rice combo with all kinds of meat"}
{"text":"Pho didn't have quality taste. It tasted plain . No flavor if you know what I mean. And it wasn't alot of noodles or beef. Did not feel full at the end"}
{"text":"Had the house special pho, good noodle and meat portions. Fresh in ingredients and lots of greens/onion slices. Most importantly, steaming hot authentic deep flavoured broth. The broth had a good mixture of herb and meat taste to it. The menu is very limited but since I usually only get pho, I didn't mind. The coffee was flavourful and strong, just the way I like it.  I would give this place a solid 7.5/10"}
