{"text":"Looked interesting, but final product had taste of a microwaved gruel with MSG.  Service was appallingly slow. Not sure they could move slower without moss growing on one side.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Terrible. Don't eat here. Pad Thai was slimy with rubbery chicken. Food took forever - saw multiple people who had been waiting for food ask them to hurry up because they had to get to their gate. From ordering to receiving my food, it was about 30 minutes. And they were out of banh mi sandwiches! Waste of money."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!  Don't do it!  Service is horrible!  Huge line waiting while 1 or 2 people stir fry dishes.  This is fast food at its worst but takes 50 minutes to get.  The staff is disorganized and doesn't care.  Never seen so many people walking away from a place in disgust or just plain angry.  Unfortunately the Pad Thai and Fried Rice is just as bad as the service."}
{"text":"They basically don't have Bahn sandwiches . They have it on menu, but they don't have it !!! The service is so slow that by the time you get to the cashier, you end up ordering another dish because you were in line for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Bread was dry. Poor costumer service. 15 minute wait for food. They are very unorganized. Bland food. You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible employees, very rude and not helpful. Also, I waited over 30 minutes for some crappy food. Just awful."}
{"text":"Wait for a classic fried rice bowl took a long time (approx. 15 mins). If you're looking for a quick bite look elsewhere. Rice bowl was very bland as well."}
{"text":"On June 12, 2018, at 9:48 PM I ordered a meal. It appeared to be the end of the day for this restaurant. The cashier/server was scaping the soup pot to accommodate another customer. The meal I ordered caused serious diarrhea problem; 3 days in Lisbon. Staff needs to be retrained about food safety. guest no 82587556ORT001"}
{"text":"Banh Shop is located next to the E70s for Air Canada. It seems to cater a fusion of Westernized Vietnamese sandwiches and bowls.  It was the morning of my 8:30 am flight, so I wasn't finnicky about my choices and opted for the steak and egg sandwich with a cup of water and coffee on the side.  While taking my order, the woman who served me seemed to be having a small argument with her co-worker. She tried to ignore the coworker to finish serving me, which was the right thing to do, but the coworker kept bickering about something, so my server regrettably had to reply to her in-between the conversation with me.  As for my order, the water came at slightly above room temperature and the coffee was insanely bitter, as if they had brewed it for double the amount of time or with double the amount of coffee grinds.  The sandwich was also a dreary mess.  It came out soaking in juices from the steak and egg, though the baguette helped to somewhat accomodate this. Flavour-wise, I found the sauce to be too sweet for a steak and egg combo and the ingredients were not melding well with one another. With the limited choices at the airport, I will still not be returning."}
{"text":"Prices on all menus are inaccurate. \"Yea we changed the prices 6 months ago but the birds (tv screens) and menus they won't change\" - This is highly illegal. In addition, human feces was found in the food last year... I'm not sure how they are still open."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!! I literally just threw away my entire disgusting noodle salad that tasted like salt and fish!! Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Horrendous. They were out of pretty much everything onthe menu. Excruciatingly slow service. Super salty pad thai. So salty that i couldn't eat more than a few bites."}
{"text":"If slow was a GAME... this place would win. Employees either ignore or move like snails. Food is 3x what it should or is worth. Skip it."}
{"text":"So happy that there is finally a reasonably priced restaurant in the T1 international departures level that doesn't just sell sandwiches.  I would've loved to try one of their bowls but I wasn't too hungry, so I just grabbed a fresh shrimp roll for the flight.  It was surprisingly very well made- nice touch with the cucumber wrap, soft rice paper wrap and not too much vermicelli. It came with a limey/fish oily/soy sorta dipping sauce. Friendly staff, would try again"}
{"text":"Only ate here because the line was shorter than the nearby places but ended up realizing it was a huge mistake since the service took FOREVER! How is that there is one person taking both orders AND making the food? Ridiculous. Also found the staff to rude. The cashier called out my number after making my sandwich and when I told her that it was mine, she seemed to doubt me and kept calling out the number. I ended up showing her the receipt which did in fact prove that that was my order and she finally gave me it. I know how to count thank you very much, so I didn't appreciate the attitude.  I got a steak banh mi which was pretty mediocre. Definitely filling, but the meat was dry and lacked in flavor. Combination of lackluster meal, long waiting time, and rude service makes for a very disappointed customer. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews but this place needs new management. The wait was forever the food was terrible. The only good thing was the sushi, but I say good only because my starving kids finished it. The rice tasted old and it was too cold. The spice coconut spot was basically a rice Plate with tomatoes, pineapple and I chose tofu. It was too sweet. The drunken noodle soup was just awful. No flavor. Noodles weren't fully cooked. And it was served in a cheap thin, plastic container. Probably letting out all sorts of petroleum in the soup as it was about 200 degrees. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Pretty bland. I ordered the chicken meatball banh sandwich and after I had paid and ordered they told me it wasn't available and would I be okay with the coconut chicken instead. I said sure, as coconut chicken is also good. Coconut chicken tasted like regular grilled chicken with zero flavouring. Get a burger from next door instead."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak and egg banh mi. They forgot the egg! Mediocre banh mi and the flavor was a 2/10."}
{"text":"Do not expect much for airport food. The service was slow and the food was very mediocre. The $2 banh from Chinatown is much better than what you get here. The banh I got had way too much sauce and mayonnaise. We tried this place because it had a shorter line than other restaurants."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here since it looked like a warm one. Got the breakfast street bowl, which was already prepacked, so service was instant. The bowl was average. The \"meatballs\" were very sweet and salty, so good thing there was plain white rice to even things out."}
{"text":"Soup come in a plastic bucket.. asked for a bowl. Nope then she give me a take out containe. Asked for fryer noodles or even crackers nope and the girl was rude. Soup was warm. Don't waist your time"}
{"text":"$12.38 CAD and a 35 minute wait from ordering to receiving food, which was a quite small portion of drunken noodles and no tofu, because they were out of tofu. They were also out of my first choice (coconut curry.) I asked for extra veg in lieu of tofu, but there were only a few veggies. Noodles were slightly sweet but otherwise quite bland."}
{"text":"Rude attendant named Michelle. I had an airport credit from a delayed flight and wanted to use the rest of the credit on a water. There were larger waters up front which I picked up. Before I checked out, I asked for a smaller water so that I didn't have to pay additional. She said there were none. When she stepped aside to prepare my sandwich, I saw a cooler full of smaller waters. When I pointed them out to her she said there was nothing she could do. She did not offer to refund the large water and re-ring for the smaller water. Just a terrible person.   The sandwich was not terrible but disappointing. Only barely warmed and presented as a mass prepared and stored food."}
{"text":"Saltiest pad thai of my life. Just awful. Wanted something less greasy than a burger, but should've gotten a sandwich from Tim Horton's."}
