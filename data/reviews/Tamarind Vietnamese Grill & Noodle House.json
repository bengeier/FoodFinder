{"text":"I had the vegetarian pho dac biet, and I have to say that if you're looking for vegetarian pho that still tastes like the real thing, this is about as good as it's going to get."}
{"text":"A few years back I was working in Portland, and had a number of really great Thai restaurants around.  Once place in particular had a spectacular Pad Thai that I never got tired of.    Fast forward to Calgary, where there is really very little around me as far as Thai restaurants go... while Vietnamese shops seem to outnumber liquor stores, which I thought would be impossible.     Apparently in Calgary, we can't get enough rice vermicelli and Vietnamese subs.    Truth be told, for a while I've been suffering from complete Vietnamese-fatigue.    Every restaurant and take out shop in the area seemed to be presenting the exact same meal, with identical flavors.  Almost like it's being prepared off-site by a 3rd party distributor (which probably isn't far from the truth).    My fatigue finally came to a head after a couple of visits to \"DQ Vietnamese,\" which is really only a couple of hundred feet from my office building.  Perfect for grabbing some quick lunch, in theory.   But after a couple of lunches that contained shrimp that WEREN'T deveined, and one occasion where they asked me if I wanted to substitute for an alternate lunch that was \"really good,\" (I said no, I'll take what I ordered), they slipped me the substitute anyhow (something I didn't discover until I was back at work), I never went back.   And actually the thought of going back kind of made me gag a little, because the flavors just weren't working out anyhow.  So they other day, I was \"Yelping\" for restaurants around me, and saw Sapna's review for Tamarind.  Tamarind is in the location that used to house \"DQ Vietnamese,\" so my mental block against it has been firmly in place for months.  I've been completely ignoring it.  But when the review said it is \"the best Vietnamese food in Calgary,\" I did a double take.  I wondered if I should take one for the team, and give it a try -- assuming it is significantly better with a  new name /owner.  Ok, glad I did!    I went for the vermicelli with beef/shrimp/spring rolls, as this is my reference point for experiences elsewhere.    It was very good.  The best part?  It didn't taste like it does everywhere else (what, not the same 3rd party distributor??).    The beef was very tender, with a great marinade.  The skewer of prawns were quite tasty (and yes, deveined... sorry I have a thing about shrimp excrement)!  The veggies were very crisp and fresh..  likewise the springrolls.   All in all, a set of flavors that stood out because it was their own, and it was good.  So nice job!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Probably the best Vegetarian Pho I've ever had. You have to ask for Veggie broth, which most places don't have."}
{"text":"Some of the best Vietnamese in the city - vegan, vegetarian or not. This place can match the flavour of their meaty counterparts, and even do it better. The ingredients are fresh, the flavours are delicious and the paradise rolls are one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"First Off; I was really expecting something special reading the reviews here. I was excited to check this place out.. and I don't believe it met up with the expectation that I had.  The location is great, Two blocks from my apartment; and I can tell they probably do quite well based on their location. It doesn't look like much from the outside, I've probably passed it a few times without giving it a glace.  The first problem I had was that it's too small for what it needs to be. Even though I only had Take Out - I can tell they need to expand their venue based on their Loyal and Interested Clientele.   I went around 1145; and was lucky because after I arrived it started to pick up. Phone Orders and 4 walk-ins put them behind, they were advising people that it could be a 15-20 minute wait for food, I could tell some people were disappointing because they were on their lunch breaks.   The menu is small; but probably right where it needs to be. A few base things with areas to be adventurous. My first qualm was that one of the items I did want to try was only available after 4PM.. the Stuffed Chicken Wings - Sound delicious on the Menu.. Will have to leave a mental note to try these.  I decided to go the safe route and order the Spring Rolls and the Bun (Vermicelli Rice Bowl). The Spring Rolls themselves were actually quite delicious, Could have used a little bit more filling and taste, but the Fish Sauce was probably one of the best ones I've tried to date. The Rice Bowl however was quite dissapointing. I got the Pork with Shrimp. The Pork was only just okay - Could have been cooked a little longer, I found that it was kinda tasteless. The best part was the Shrimp however.. Plump and Juicy, They were really quite delicious!  I found that the Flavor was really lacking for the food. They have a long way to go to catch up with Quynh, Which I would say is the best in the City.  Overall; The Location, The Hours and for what it is, This is the best Vietnamese that I've tried in the area. However they have a long way to catch up with the other Vietnamese Locations in the city."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night. It was busy but we were seated within 10 min. The house Pho was excellent, I'm not a huge fan of 'mock meat' but it was interesting.  Lots of vegetables in the Pho and the Thai basil was so fresh.  The portion was big enough for 3 people!  The pad Thai was really good also.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I just tried Tamarind for the first time and am thoroughly impressed. The satay tofu noodle soup and spring rolls were delicious! Since going vegan seven years ago I have had a hard time finding decent pho - but the long search is over. I finally have a place to get my favourite cold weather meal and I am psyched!"}
{"text":"Finally veggie pho!  I've been poisoned (and yes meat eaters, we get sick from eating animal products-fat especially) by too many Vietnamese places to count who have claimed their veggie pho was made without beef broth. Finally I found Tamarind. Thank the vegan gods.   My pho was loaded with veggies and noodles, and the boyfriend's sub and pad thai (also both vegan) were in the top ranks of average taste wise. What really sets tamarind apart was the service.   We were warned that veganizing our meal would take extra time, but only waited maybe 15 minutes for 3 dishes to arrive from the tiny kitchen. The staff were quick to refill water and pho sides just before they ran out and the chef even came out to assure us that all our food would in fact be vegan because she herself was.   Will definitely be back to this mom and pop shop for more noodely goodness."}
{"text":"Great little family run place. The mock meats are made in-house and all taste incredible. Service is always on point and the prices can't be beat"}
{"text":"Note! The two stars means \"Meh. I've experienced better\", not this place is not good and never come here!  The place was small, and it seems like it's very popular for people to call ahead and order for pick up.  I had the green mango salad, so I can only comment on that. It was not really that great. For my tastes it had too much white onion, and the flavours were simple, but not to my liking because of how much thai basil was in it.   As for the presentation, it was just julienned vegetables on a plate, with some garnish. I'm sure the pad thai many other reviewers enjoy was very good, but I didn't care much for the salad."}
{"text":"Amazing! I specifically went to NYC to seek out delicious vegan food, and Tamarind is still one of my favourite restaurants ever! Excellent food and staff, and I love supporting a family business. I hope they will one day be open on Sundays and past 8pm ;)"}
{"text":"Very authentic food; tasty and freshly prepared, very nice and friendly owners/servers and very reasonable price. What else to ask for. Will definitely patronize whenever I can... They even offered a complimentary vegetarian lunch on Thanksgiving....I'm humbled by their true thankful spirit!"}
{"text":"When my sister and I had a craving for Vietnamese soup, I suggested we try Tamarind because of a post I saw on social media.  I was really surprised at the full menu of vegetarian and vegan options available. We settled on some bo lo lot and a couple soups (pho and duck noodle) to share.  I've eaten vegetarian and vegan food from time to time, some of it good some of it not so good. But also, I never feel completely full without meat.  That wasn't the case at Tamarind! Not only was everything so flavorful, things that \"should be\" meat in our dishes tasted like meat, and I was actually full! (No 2nd dinner stops at McDonald's for us!)  I underestimated the power vegetarian/vegan dishes. When done right, it's quite amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Very courteous staff :)...Did I say delicious food?"}
{"text":"Lately I've been trying vegan/vegetarian restaurants because I made the lifestyle change to becoming vegan. This was the first place I tried and was pleasantly pleased with how everything tasted!   I got the Veggie Pad Thai and my boyfriend got the Tofu Curry Stir Fry. I'd say the Pad Thai was delicious and the Curry was good but needed a bit more flavor but overall we enjoyed it. The staff was super friendly and welcoming and we would definitely come back to try some more dishes! The only thing I would say is that, it's a small place and the server forgot our drinks but he made up for it with his friendliness."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place they were quick and everything we ordered was amazing! Which usually this doesn't happen... Taste was fresh, vibrant and full of clean flavour, we agree one of the best Vietnamese places we have ever had. The only thing I ask is that they post a menu on yelp would love to try some more of there delicious creations... Thankyou for the great experience! Hands down will recommend you from here on in!"}
{"text":"I had vegetarian pho. It's really rare that a restaurant has so many options for vegans and vegetarians. The mock meat is very realistic."}
{"text":"Omg, my husband and I visited Calgary last weekend and popped in here Saturday night to eat. Unfortunately all the tables were booked, but we grabbed some food to go, and HOLY CRAP, it is the BEST Vietnamese food I've ever had! My husband got the Pad Thai and I got the tofu basil curry - both SO delicious! We wanted to go again for lunch on Sunday, but you guys were closed. I 110% recommend this place to everyone! Can't wait to try more dishes - we savoured every single bite! Thanks so much for an amazing meal to remember! :)"}
{"text":"I called to order a papaya salad and a canh chua (sweet and sour soup) to go. I also asked for veggie lo lot rolls, they're my favorite street food dish in Vietnam and Tamarind is the only place I've seen sold it, unfortunately they ran out for the day. The green papaya salad was a good portion with lots of tofu and \"ham\". The canh chua was delicious, it's missing the catfish but the sweet and sourness from the tamarind was spot on. Can't wait to go back and work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"I get the hype. When you expect \"veg*n food,\" it definitely surpasses your expectations. As just food, it's pretty good.  I had a pho, and it was yummy enough, with plenty of veg and tidbits to nom on. If I were completely vegetarian (as opposed to the cheater that I am), I would probably adore this place for adding some Vietnamese light into my meatless life. As a cheater pseudo-vegetarian (who really enjoys and eats mostly vegetarian foods), I would say this place is pretty good.   Cute little shop, food that is yummy and sustainable and doesn't leave you hating yourself - you can't argue with all that.   I will be back if I want Vietnamese food and am feeling like a responsible citizen."}
{"text":"Wow! I was so impressed with this tiny hole-in-the-wall sized Vietnamese restaurant. A family run affair with both the Mum and Dad from Vietnam, the food is deliciously fresh and full of flavour.   The menu consists of vegan and vegetarian dishes only. Don't let this turn you off. The dishes packed a punch in flavour and I left very, very satisfied and very full. As I was with two people who usually prefer meat in their meals, the waiter (the son) took time to explain to us which dishes had the most flavor and would be liked by those who prefer the traditional Vietnamese dishes with meat (ie the Pho soups).  We shared Paradise rolls to start and then moved onto the vegetarian Pad Thai, the vermicelli noodles with spring rolls and tofu and the curry soup. All were tasty and fresh as Vietnamese dishes should be.  Even though we were full, one of my dinner guests asked if there was dessert. Usually there isn't but the family had made up tapioca with coconut milk and banana for themselves for their dinner and offered to share this with us as they had made more than they needed. Amazing. And so tasty.  So on top of friendly, informative and warm service, the food tasted amazing and was dirt cheap. Couldn't say a bad word about this place. I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's official. I have fallen head over heels in love.   Tamarind Vietnamese Grill & Noodle House is brand spankin' new to our city and mark my words: It is *the best* Vietnamese food in Calgary.  Aesthetically speaking, this restaurant (which is no more than 5 tables) couldn't be more simple. No frills, no bells and no whistles. But when a place has food *this* good, it sure as heck doesn't need the distraction of fancy decor.   Having graced Calgary in June 2010, Tamirand is owned and operated by the Nguyen family. Long (Father), Phung (Mother), Dessa (Daughter) and Alex (Son) did Calgary a great service when they decided to take their secret family recipes out of their kitchen and into a restaurant for all to enjoy.  After having walked by a multitude of times and resisting the tantalizing scents that seep from the door, I finally gave in and had dinner here tonight.  I was immediately impressed when I was told that they would happily revamp any dish on their menu into a vegetarian modification. Above and beyond that, Phung personally came over to me to inform me that even if there is a vegetarian Vietnamese dish that I would like to have that is not on their menu, as long as she can make it, she'd be happy to personally whip it up for me. Being a connoisseur of the vegetarian palate, Phung is happy to go out of her way to accommodate us vegetarians in the city. How refreshing!  I ordered (which wasn't on the menu, but ask and thou shall receive...) a vegetarian vermicelli bowl. What I got was heaven in a bowl. In all my travels, I have never, and I mean *never*, had a vermicelli bowl this delicious. I inhaled it along with an avocado shake with pearls on the side (which we may as well refer to as heaven in a cup).  Although Tamirand is still very new to our city, they have big plans. As demand increases, they will offer more and more vegetarian selections, gluten-free options, and maybe even a delivery service.  Tamirand may seem unassuming and simple from the outside, but once inside, it wont take long for you to realize that the food is as good as it gets. The quality and freshness of the food, the expertise and genuineness of the owners, and the versatility and flexibility of the menu are all what make Tamirand an unbelievable addition to our city.  Right about now you're probably asking yourself the following:  \"WHY haven't *I* heard of Tamirand up until now?!?!?\"  Well, it's because Tamirand is based on word-of-mouth advertising so you know what I say to that?  It's time we got talkin'."}
{"text":"NOTE: If you are looking for this restaurant, it is on 10th street before you get to 6th avenue!  Oftentimes, when we aren't sure what we want to eat, my girlfriend and will cruise around downtown looking for certain types of food on Yelp. I was craving some pho, and this place came up on the list cause of the high reviews.  This is a small restaurant - incredibly cozy atmosphere. It was just the two of us there, but I think it could be quite noisy had there been more people inside. It was about an hour before closing when we were there.  We had ordered veggie spring rolls to start, and an iced Vietnamese coffees. She ordered the pad thai and I'd ordered a beef pho. The veggie rolls were absolutely delicious, however we had polished those off and my dinner partner was partway through her main course before our coffees arrived.  I definitely don't consider myself a pho expert - I had my first pho a month or so prior to this. It was ok, in my line of thinking - there was quite a bit of beef, the seasoning was alright. Nothing mind-blowingly spectacular.  Something I did find a bit odd - our meals didn't come at the same time. That's not a huge deal to me, but since there was only 2 of us and not a large group it seem a bit strange.  We did note, however, that the wall that our table was against appeared quite dirty, like as though people had splashed something on it multiple times and it got missed in the nightly cleanup.   Service-wise, it was kind of odd. Our water glasses were never empty, but it seemed like we had to make a move to leave to get the bill.  This is a place that I would go back to, because the food as good but it seemed like otherwise they were having an \"off\" night."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place is amazing!!! I am a shit vegetarian because I love bacon and beef sate pho... but I've found an alternative!!! Thank god!!! I can finally enjoy hearty and flavourful pho with something close enough to meat that I don't miss it (or the constipation from eating it...) Everything on the menu is beef and pork and normal food, and tastes amazing, but there's no actual meat! I've already tricked 3 of my mom vegetarian friends with the spring rolls, wontons, etc. Small place, first come first serve, but damn please keep this place alive!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The mock meats are amazing. I come here all the time and the take out is great too. Small place but very friendly, family run, amazing food."}
{"text":"2 appetizers ( fried wontons & veggie la lot rolls) & 2 entrees (sizzling sticky rice & 'beef' with spring rolls on a bed of noodles )  All of it was delicious! & very picture worthy. The waiter asked how we were doing often, refilled water & cleared dishes in a timely fashion.  we'll be back!  & it all came to just under $45!"}
{"text":"For the last couple of years, I've had to avoid Vietnamese and Chinese restaurants, because I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance. Fun, when a lot of the vegan-friendly restaurants in town rely heavily on soy sauce and vital wheat gluten (seitan) as an ingredient.  Tamarind was originally a regular Vietnamese restaurant, and then somewhere around the same time Hearts Choices was opening; they converted their entire menu to the tree hugger side. Since they did serve meat at one time, they feel the need to apologize for this \"inconvenience,\" when they greet you at the door. Don't worry. You'll get over this hiccup when you taste the food. The restaurant is tiny, about a block away from the old Anju and alongside the Kerby LRT station.  As someone who is used to having to tailor side dishes in order to accommodate dietary restrictions, being able to order more than one thing on the menu made me so happy that I may have had eyes bigger than my stomach. I ordered the Bi Cuon (Fresh Paradise) rolls, Cha Dum (Tofu \"Mini\" Pie --- don't be fooled, it's huge), and the Phô Tau Hu. They apologized for being out of Jackfruit salad, so my friend sensibly ordered one Sizzling Sticky Rice.   Some things on the menu are incorrectly labeled as GF, which I noticed immediately because a dish with mock ham claimed to be GF. This is impossible, when almost all mock meat is made with vital wheat gluten. The server himself pointed this out, with many apologies and made sure that I was well taken care of.   The Phô was very flavorful, albeit a bit on the salty side, and packed full of fresh veggies. I love being able to get Phô in Calgary without having to make it myself, or fear that I'm secretly getting a bowl full of beef broth. The saltiness was remedied with the lime wedge provided, along with the bean sprouts, basil leaves and sriracha spiral. One thing I really missed, was having peanut sauce to dunk my salad rolls in.  I can't wait to come back! If they get their menu properly sorted out, they're easily a five star place. Probably not the place you'd take a large crowd, it's pretty tiny, but definitely a great space to catch up with a friend or have a lunch date."}
{"text":"The food here is super tasty, colorful, aromatic, and hearty! I love it :) The service is excellent! Don't hesitate to try it! If you can, order many dishes and share :)"}
{"text":"A large selection of vegan dishes- I had the tofu sate pho which was savoury, spicy and sweet! The broth was a wonderful balance of flavour and the veggies still had a lot of crunch in the soup.   I highly recommend Tamarind, and love to support family run restaurants. Everyone was so kind and the atmosphere was really nice.  Thanks for a wonderful vegan meal!"}
{"text":"Mom and pop shops like this deserve more support!! Great homemade food, great value, pretty quick, I get takeout from here all the time as I live upstairs. Their vermicelli and rice platters are awesome! Pho is alright. Would also recommend the rice wrapper rolls, really good!!"}
{"text":"We happened to stumble upon this restaurant and were very nicely surprised by the high quality of the food and friendly service.  It's now a fully vegetarian and vegan restaurant since the mother is vegetarian. Very healthy and fresh food at a very reasonable price.  Highly recommend it to vegetarian and even those wanting to experiment a bit more. Their meatless meats taste like the real thing too.  Hopefully more restaurants like this will open up in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I wandered into Tamarind Vietnamese Grill after having \"one of those days\" that cries out for comfort food.  After seating me in the small dinning area, the server noted that the menu is entirely vegan, which was fine ... because what modern meat eater doesn't dig a little tofu from time to time?  I ordered the Paradise Rolls (i.e. salad rolls) and Lemongrass Vermicelli.  The appetizer rolls came out quickly and were well prepared.  The vermicelli main was flavourful and included cubed tofu, vegetables, and a variety of sprouts and crispy tidbits.  I enjoyed the meal with no complaints.  The food tasted good.  The thing is, Tamarind's dinning area is kind of a cluttered mess.  Not dirty ... but I wouldn't call it sparkling clean either.  The menus are on printed sheets of paper, which is also a little difficult to take seriously.  All of that said, the experience was positive and I would return regardless ... for a lazy Saturday afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"For a vegetarian Vietnamese restaurants, this place is great. To be honest, I didn't miss the meat at all. Tarmarind makes a wicked tofu, it's only trump by Shokunin's version.  The portions are filling and the prices are reasonable. It's a bit more than your average pho house, but the quality is better. This isn't some messy slop that's sloshed into a bucket in front of you. Everything is homemade and plated with care. I didn't care so much for the tofu stack because I didn't find it that flavourful. I enjoyed my sate tofu soup and the broth was intense.   Service is slow and it takes a while for the food to come out, but that's because this place is popular and a tiny spot."}
{"text":"Really cute place. Lots of selections. Tried the vegan pho and it was awesome. Will be back to try different items."}
{"text":"This place is unreal. I love supporting this locally owned business. It is 100% vegan and they make all of their tofu in house (and you can tell!) it's so fresh and delicious. I don't always love tofu and I absolutely love it here. I feel good after the food I eat and feel that everything is reasonably priced for a vegan restaurant in this city. I always recommend tamarind to friends and family! My fiancé and I come regularly :) the paradise rolls, pad Thai, and curry stir fry is our go-to's!"}
{"text":"Looking for Vietnamese, and this place had good reviews, so it was no surprise we chose it. When we arrived we were surprised to find out it was a Vegan restaurant  (yes it's noted fairly clearly on Yelp, but I missed it). Neither of us planned a dish sans meat, AND neither of us care for tofu, BUT we stayed and decided to give this place a chance (besides we were starving)! We ordered spring rolls for an appetizer and my fiancé ordered veggie pad thai and I ordered eggplant stirred fry (yes I spelled it right) We did little talking and lots of eating. Food was absolutely delicious, perfect temperature and flavor and surprise we both liked the tofu!  It was cooked perfect - crispy on the edges and tasty. We will be back, this time with our eyes wide open knowing full well it's Vegan!!"}
{"text":"Tamarind Vietnamese Grill & Noodle House is a short three block stroll from my office.    Two of the three reviews currently written are from other reviewers that I have linked up to through Yelp, that both enjoyed the food there.  I will agree with both Sapna and Nick on their assessment of Tamarind.  Everything I tried was great!  When I checked out the menu, I went digging for the spiciest thing I could find.  I found the Pad Thai with Chicken (it had a picture of a little pepper beside it on the menu, so I figured that was a safe bet).  When I ordered, I asked them to feel free to add any extra spice.    I also ordered the fresh salad rolls with tofu.  I knew the Pad Thai was going to feed me for two days, but I can never resist a fresh salad roll with peanut sauce.  Also, I couldn`t help but try the fresh avocado shake.  I figured it was going to be a calorie bomb, but I had a sore throat, and in that moment, that looked like the perfect remedy.  When I placed my order, they prepared everything fresh behind the counter where I could easily see the whole process.  I saw the lady making my pad thai give a generous, generous helping of hot sauce, which made me quite happy.  Another gal was preparing my fresh salad rolls from scratch and rolling them up with all the fixing, asking me questions as I went (i.e. do you like basil?).  While I was waiting, another lady came up behind me and had a $10 bill in her hand, ordering the pad thai.  She made a comment to the gentlemen behind the cash register that she was addicted to it.  She had her cash in her hand before she even ordered.    Another 3 people came in behind her within minutes, picking up orders.  So, it looks like you can call ahead and pre-order and simply swing by and pick up your order.  Good to know!  The pad thai was amazing!  And for me, the portion was huge.  I ate about a third of it, and the next day, I split the other 2/3's with my colleague.  If its even possible, it was better the second day reheated.  And... it was both flavorful and spicy!  My palate can take a lot of heat, and I was pleased!  The fresh salad rolls and peanut sauce were extremely good, and the avocado shake was..... interesting. :)  I have never had one before, and in the right circumstances, I would order one again.  I love avocados, but picture an avocado blended with ice, milk (or cream?) and sweetener.  It tasted exactly as you would expect of that combination of foods.  I'm not sure if those were the only ingredients, but that is what it looked like and tasted like.  It was tasty in an positively, interesting way.  When I got back to the office, I told two sets of co-workers about my lunch.  Hopefully all this good press will give Tamarind a long and successful life in Calgary.    Now that I know they're there, I want them to stay.  This place is definately a must try!"}
{"text":"the spring rolls were 5/5.     the spicey beef noodle soup was spicey and delicious.  tofu and mock beef and turkey were great.  only complaint is the noodles were overcooked.   3/5  great price point and face and friendly service. 5/5."}
{"text":"Curse you tamarind!!!! I'm completely addicted.  I find myself laying in bed at night tossing and turning, dreaming of the hot sate tofu noodle soup.  I go to tamarind so often that I can walk in and they know my order. Even if you aren't vegan you will love this place.   Perfect place to take a vegan or non vegan friend!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, service is supper friendly, the lady makes me feel like home:)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Even if you are not vegan, you should try this place because it will blow you away!"}
{"text":"A little tricky to find, this restaurant is around the corner from the actual street address. Once you find it, though, you find a cozy restaurant with a modestly-long menu of delicious dishes. Everything looked tempting, and everything I got was wonderful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am visiting Calgary on business and was looking for a vegan and gluten free restaurant to try out and I found this gem of a place on yelp  great food and friendly service! I defiantly recommend anyone to eat here."}
{"text":"While visiting Calgary, this place was the one that people always mentioned as a \"must try\", and we were not disappointed.   We had the bun hue soup, which was spicy and delicious, with a variety of mock meats and noodles. As a side order, we had the fried spring rolls, which were flaky and very tasty. I didn't see a dessert menu, but if they don't currently offer them, it would be nice if they brought in a vendor to sell vegan treats as well.  The service was polite and prompt, and the owner was a delight to talk with.   I would definitely love to go back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying vegan food and this dish simply BLEW MY MIND, I'm from Miami and went on a business trip to Calgary 3 years ago and up until this moment I still remember the very first bite on this simple yet amazing dish. I've been planing a trip to Calgary just so I can order this dish again. Don't know the name so if anyone knows it please let me know I would love to recreate this dish at home. YUMMMM"}
{"text":"I stopped by at noon during the office lunch hour rush and was lucky to get a table without waiting.  This place is extremely tiny and would not be suitable for any parties bigger than a table of 4.  The staff are extremely courteous and friendly. I ordered the pho dac biet (special rice noodle soup) and an avocado shake.  Both were excellent. I did note that food prep time was on the slower side and my avocado shake did not arrive until mid meal. There were also an assortment of very authentic vietnamese appetizers that I will try the next time I return."}
{"text":"I was expecting AMAZING after reading the reviews, but ended up getting AVERAGE.   We wanted pho so did a search on Yelp for great places and came up with this one. After finally finding a parking spot, we walked down 6th Ave and were a little worried that we couldn't find the restaurant (especially after attempting to go to lunch somewhere that was closed for a private function that day).   We were walking back to the car to warm up when I spotted Tamarind - it's actually on 10th ST! So the address is a little misleading... building is 6th Ave, actual venue on 10th.  We arrived about an hour before close and were the only ones there. We took a seat, mulled over the menu, ordered veggie spring rolls and a couple of iced vietnamese coffees (when it was -20 out?? We're nuts). And then an order of beef pho and pad thai.   The coffees took forever to arrive. As in, we were done the spring rolls (which were good) and I was partway into my main when the drinks arrived. Also, our meals came to the table separately, about 5 or so minutes apart. I get that they wanted mine to arrive hot, and often when there are large parties not all meals arrive at the same time, but when there are only 2, it makes more sense to bring both mains at once.  I'm not a pad thai expert, but I was hoping for a little more flavour & kick, I guess. It was good, but didn't blow me out of the water.  At the end of the meal, they never brought a bill, despite the fact we were obviously done. After some time, we packed up and walked to the till. Not sure if this is standard practice but we weren't informed otherwise.  Maybe it was just an off day, or perhaps this place is more authentic than the other pho/vietnamese places I've been? Not sure, but it wasn't a great experience.  Oh, and the walls desperately need a cleaning. I understand the \"hole in the wall\" feeling that's going on, but once I noticed it, I couldn't stop staring at the dirty walls.  I'll probably try again, likely get a lemongrass chicken dish as this seems to be my 'usual.' Hopefully my next visit is AMAZING.  (23/30)"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  A vegetarian Vietnamese place in Calgary????  WOW.  I had their spicy pho and it was out of this world.  A massive bowl fool of hot goodness that I cant find in New York even.  There was a vegetarian Vietnamese place called Vin Loi Tofu in LA I used to hit up, but this is so much better.  The owner, cute vietnamese lady who has the motherly touch to the food, provided the service.  She just turned vegan and converted the restaurant to vegetarian.  I am trying to figure out how to spread the word so the family succeeds and I continue to get great veggie pho.  Amazing.  Please check it out!  I am very passionate about this place doing well.  Its a gem that cant be found anywhere in North America..believe me...I have tried hard and traveled far to find similar food!"}
{"text":"Best pad Thai EVER! Everything I've tried here has been amazing. My only complaint is that they don't deliver."}
{"text":"Oh Tamarind. This place has been on my radar for a while. Despite being a meat-lover, I'm a firm believer that flavour can come from a lot of different places and vegetarian food, especially tofu, can be done right if done carefully.   Tamarind is a small restaurant at the foot of a condo building on 10st SW. My first impression upon walking in was that it really reminds me of Asia - with the cramped kitchen and the fact it looks like a family run joint. They keep track of orders on a modified excel sheet and there are probably only 5 tables.  By posh Canadian Standards, the cramped kitchen probably doesn't instill much confidence in cleanliness, but the quality of the food definitely speaks for itself. If one adjusts one's mindset to \"stepping into a small hole in the wall joint in Asia\", you can really have a good time.   I tried their tofu Rolls (tofu wrapped in some sort to leaf, I had no idea what it was) as well as their crispy wontons for starters. The tofu rolls were pretty interesting and had a pretty decent flavour. The Crispy wontons were nothing special and were served with sweet chili sauce (definitely from a bottle).   The main dishes were little more interesting. Between the three of us we tried the Tofu Curry, sizzling rice stir fry, and the curry noodle soup.   I thought the tofu curry was the stand-out. The texture of the tofu and the deep rich flavour of the curry absolutely made this vegetarian dish interesting and vibrant. The hot plate sizzling rice had an interesting flavour as well, though it lacked the depth of the curry.   The curry soup was a bit of a mixed bag. the Broth was thin, which is as one would expect, but I felt that because of that the depth and richness of the curry flavours didn't come through as much as they could have. Similarly, the thin rice noodles used had a tendency to fall apart and were not super satisfying. The various tofu products in the soup were great though, including the \"mock meat\", and overall it was a pretty decent bowl.   Given that it's a vegetarian option, I thought that the menu was pretty robust and offered a fair bit of flavour. At it's approachable price point, this is a pretty good choice for vegetarian fare and I would come visit again."}
{"text":"Haven't had bun bo hue in over a year, so when I heard this restaurant had a vegan version, I practically ran over there for dinner. It was so flavorful, and thru like their homemade tofu was out of this world, and they load the so up with tons of veggies. I wasn't a fan of the mock meats though. I keep coming back to try more on their menu, but I can't seem to stay from bun bo hue, my friend did have the tofu pho and loved it."}
{"text":"I live right near this place so whenever I crave soup I get it from here. I'm not a vegetarian but I really like tofu so that this is a vegan restaurant suits me fine. The pad thai is tasty, the sizzling crepe appetizer (Banh Xeo Chay) is yummy and filing and the curry soup is comfort food at it's finest. Great food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place has been vegan/vegetarian for 1.5 years now and I'm so glad they made the switch!!! Truly vegan/vegetarian pho is hard to find and their broth doesn't suffer at all despite not having any meat. It's rich and flavorful and not one dimensionally salty like I find many vegetarian versions of things to be. Even though I haven't eaten meat for years I can still tell that the mock meat won't actually fool you but that doesn't mean it isn't delicious! The fake \"cartilage/fat\" thing is especially interesting. I had the saté and it was just the right amount of spicy. My friend had the house special and it was also quite tasty. They are also generous with vegetables, unlike other restaurants' \"vegetarian\" pho (how can you have vegetarian pho with only like 5 pieces of vegetables??).   The family who owns the place seems to genuinely care about you and it shows in their friendly service. The place is small and they're busy with takeout orders as well so be prepared to wait; but, it's totally worth it! The only thing we didn't really love was the smoothie but maybe it was an off day. This place is definitely a new favourite for me!"}
{"text":"Tasty, affordable, and always fresh. It's a perfect hole in the wall, and the restaurant I recommend to any vegan/vegetarian pals who come visit."}
{"text":"Not the quickest place to get to unless you're in the area - but totally worth it. We routed our the trip from the airport through here in order to get a good lunch before we stopped around the \"busier\" (lol) parts of downtown for some quick shopping before taking off to BC.  The food was outstanding! We got it to go and ate it in my rental car while sitting in the parking lot of Community Natural Foods - and even then it was still so delicious! After sampling everything I did I'm pretty comfortable recommending nearly anything off the menu so long as it sounds good to you... Don't go ordering something you typically dislike and then blame me.  Make the effort to get over here and eat."}
{"text":"For a vegan restaurant it was really tasty and a lot to choose from. I had the pad Thai and it was flavourful. The only thing that made it unpleasant was it felt a little dirty. Our table wasn't cleaned, the chairs were  soiled and stained. The menus could be put in plastic sleeves, soft background music could be playing ? little details can go a long way."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food! I'd recommend this place to anyone. And if you're a vegan it's fantastic. I wish there were more places like this around Calgary.  The lady that owns the restaurant genuinely cared that her customers were satisfied.  The one thing thing I would have liked that they couldn't provide was a cup of coffee, but the food was so good it doesn't even matter."}
{"text":"Holly molly what the what!  After months of travels to Calgary, now I can finally boast back home .. 'Have you been to Calgary? Oh you have. But have you had vegan Pho which knocks your socks off?'!  So, this place is at arms length from where I work and somehow I missed it all this time. I just googled soup the other day and man o man!  So far, I've sampled the Tom Yum Soup, Mango Salad and Sate Tofu Noodle Soup. Everything has been fresh, flavourful and simply amazing!  And I hugely admire the way they properly pack my takeouts. Service counter is quick and professional. Haven't dined in yet so can't talk about an 'end to end' dining experience but somehow I'm certain that won't disappoint either!"}
{"text":"Call me spoiled-- but my experience was mediocre. I've been warned, coming to Calgary from Vancouver, that all bar food is better in Calgary while comparing Calgary's Asian food with Vancouver would leave me disappointed. So far, it has been true.  Ordered a tofu vermicelli bowl with spring rolls, and the grilled tofu was terribly salty, vermicelli floppy and the side veggies tasting like they were grabbed out of a salad mix bag. Overall, I've had much better vermicelli bowls for 3 dollars less In Van."}
{"text":"I've live above this tiny Vietnamese restaurant for quite some time. In a city where Pho-shops are a dime a dozen it's always nice to find one that's truly good. The food is always fresh and prepared with extra care. The family running the place is also always nice and welcoming.   If you're looking for a good Pho or a decent sub, Tamarind is definitely a great spot."}
{"text":"Small, \"hole in the wall\" place that doesn't disappoint!  Not very many seats but the service is quick, so turn around doesn't take much time. I am a huge pho fan, always on the hunt for the best one, and this place delivered one of the best I have had in years. I still think about going back for more weeks later. My friend order one of the noodle bowls and quite enjoyed it.  If you are looking for a quiet, tasty, friendly and quick meal, this is where you should go."}
{"text":"We got rice paper deep fried spring roll. It's a must try item. The spring roll is more chewy than the regular deep fried spring roll and it is not greesy at all.  Really friendly service at the restaurant, definitely a cozy place for dining with friends and family. But the restaurant area is pretty small. It's a good place for 4 people to dine.   House noodle special is nice!  The owner made her own tofu from scratch, beginning from bean. It tastes awesome!  Although it's a vegan restaurant, they made their \"meat\" taste like real meat!  Their soup base for house special noodle soup is really good too."}
{"text":"My sister, her fiance, and I were looking for a place to eat.  Naturally, I loaded up the Yelp app and checked out what was nearby.  In my bookmarks, 0.1 km away, was Tamarind (I had seen Sapna's review last year and decided I would try it some time).  We decided to go there -- especially since it is literally across the street from their apartment.  As Sapna said, it really is small.  We walked in and were greeted by a very nice lady, who I presume was Phung.  It smelled great in there, which we all agreed was a good start.  We ordered the Tamarind Platter, an appetizer with 2 chicken skewers, 2 beef skewers, 2 shrimp skewers, 2 spring rolls, and 2 salad rolls.  It came out quickly, although not with napkins.  When I went up and asked for some, Phung was very apologetic and told me her son and waitress were both unable to come in that day, so she was working by herself.  No need to apologize -- she was rocking it better than some restaurants do at full staff!  Everything on the plate was delicious.  The salad rolls were fresh and the shrimp inside tasted great.  The skewered shrimp had just the right amount of spice, and the beef was amazing.  The peanut sauce and spring rolls were the best any of us have ever had.  We all ordered Pho -- my sister and I had chicken satay, and her fiance had the beef satay.  His beef came out barely cooked, just like it should be (the broth cooks it right in front of you).  Just like a steak, it ended up perfect by the time he went to eat it.  The chicken satay Pho (soup) was excellent.  The broth was easily the best I've had.  The chicken was a bit overdone, but still tasted good.  They both haven't eaten much Vietnamese, but they say they will now!  I'm jealous that they live so close to this gem.  They even plan to come here at night to order subs for their lunches the next day; at only $5.50, that's a healthy and relatively inexpensive way to go.  I will be back here whenever I can -- Tamarind is my new favourite Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Overall experience was good. Went with a friend who is vegan over the weekend. A small little mom and pop shop with a few tables so we had to wait a little while, not a problem. Took a while to get our drinks and the menus which I thought was a little weird since there just isn't that many tables. We got an order of the spring rolls to share and I had the Bun Hue. Their dishwasher was broken so we got served in take out containers... which is fine, these things happen. The food overall was pretty decent and the \"meat\" was good, it was mild in taste and the texture was nice. Spring rolls could use a little work - not a ton of flavour, but overall the meal was enjoyable."}
{"text":"So delicious. Small location but always completely packed for the best vegan Vietnamese ever. Eggplant stir fry and vermicelli dishes are my go to's, but everything I've ever tried is delicious, well-flavoured, served hot, and the prices are amazing and don't do the quality justice. Kind owners and staff really care about the quality and are kind as well."}
{"text":"Updated my last review...    Had fresh spring rolls,  Faux beef Pho and Pad Thai ( again)  Delish ...my son didn't know it was vegan till I told him...he enjoyed his meal very much.  LOVE this little place!"}
