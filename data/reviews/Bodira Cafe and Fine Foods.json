{"text":"This place is absolutely a gem. This Italian cafe which sells hot foods, coffee, deli and groceries, is only 10 minutes walk distance from our house and I was super surprised when I saw the high review on Yelp that we had to check it out. So my boyfriend and I decided to give a try as we were craving for authentic great Italian food. The first visit, we both ordered veal sandwich and I had to say that it was the best veal sandwich we have ever had. This is someone who has tried many well know italian establishments around the GTA including expensive Italian restaurants.  You could taste the Italian-Sicilian \"home-made\" taste from every bite. Rice balls, any hot sandwich is a must try.  Summer time they have homemade ice cream. They even do catering and have a variety of pastas. You could feel that every dish was made with heart and passion. The Cappuccino and latte was just perfect and addictive.   Ever since our first time there we have been back to the cafe every weekend (5 counts so far) and debate what to order as all of their food is just delicious and filling. The husband and wife are such great people and love to talk about their food while making their customers welcome. I can tell each time they are so happy to see us getting satisfied from their food."}
{"text":"This cafe is a neighbourhood gem! The owners (Ann and Sebastian) are super nice!  I ordered coffee and croissant for breakfast. The croissant was super delicious and huge.   It was a nice \"grab and go\" little shop with imported Italian goods. I would definitely be back for cheese and meat platters in the future!"}
{"text":"This place cured my desire for fine meats.  The only problem is I need to keep going back to get my fix of fine meats.  Five stars. We ordered the pasta with rose sauce and it was the best rose sauce we've ever had. We also had the veal sandwich which was great. To finish things off, we got 2 scoops of gelato and a latte. The gelato was so good and boy do they give you a lot! The gelato is made in house with less sugar which was so delicious.  Sick latte just perfect hit the spot.  Be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Their cannoli are pretty good, they don't really advertise that they have them which is weird."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  Wow amazing! Everything is made in house. I had the pasta in rose sauce which was delicious. Exactly the way they make it in Italy. Owners are so warm and welcoming. Loved my experience here!  I spent the entire day here. I had a cappuccino, studied and had lunch! Definitely will be back another time for desert!  Okay I ended up having the desert, this tiramisu is life people!! You'll want to try it"}
{"text":"Nice little Italian place around the neighbourhood. I noticed one day when I was driving by. Decided to go in and have a look. I was actually craving for an Italian sandwich that day. I went in and I was greeted right away. They happily gave me a run down of what they offer. I can tell right away these were genuine great people. The owners Ann and Sebastian introduced me to their homemade Gelato's. I had to try every flavour, all of them were point and it had more of a natural flavour than other places I have tried before. After that they gave me a lemon drink to try, Sebastian tells me he makes from fresh lemons every morning. Woke me up with the nice strong taste of lemons. They have another flavour made of almonds. My suggestion is to mix them both and it gives you this great balance of two. I ended up getting a chicken sandwich with mushrooms and cheese. In the corner of my eye, I saw canoli's in the fridge. They told me they make fresh everyday and they also have the chocolate ricotta fillings made with the real Italian Nutella. Everything and I mean everything I had ever eaten there is delicious, simply because whatever they make is made with love and care.  They love to see us enjoy their labour of love, they always encourage you to eat there so you eat it nice and fresh. I have gone there at least once a week. They will make virtually anything you want as long as you give them 1 or 2 day in advance. I would recommend the penne pasta with rose sauce. My wife is even hooked on this place. She loves the lemon and almond drink. I will always support such dedicated and great owners. If you don't feel like cooking then come here for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Summary: small, family run restaurant offers pasta, veal and chicken sandwiches, and fine meats, rice balls, as well as gelato!  Top Must-Get: veal sandwich/deli sandwiches  The owner Sebastiano is a friendly man who will explain the best deli meats to get if you ask. This place is small but feels fairly cozy.   The menu is small, but keeping it simple is great. I liked the veal sandwich, but the deli meats steal the show. They're fair sized and all sandwiches comes with mushrooms and peppers.  In the summer, they make homemade gelato.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Rating is high for good reasons. Hosts are friendly and have great pride of their food. Everything tastes good especially the pasta, gelato and tiramisu. Highly recommend to anyone who wants good Italian food!"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood looking for a bite  to eat. Thank you fellow Yelpers for suggesting this lovely cafe.   Walked in and the owner greeted me with a warm smile. I told him this was my first time there and he was so eager to explain things off of his menu and even offered me samples to try. He even suggested what combo to try in my sandwich (Capicollo, Sopprata Sada, Provolone = YUM). Their weekly special was a ham and cheese sandwich for $5.99. They also have a number of hot entrees that are homemade from fresh ingredients (they grow their own basil).   The owner offered me a complimentary Cappuchino which was smooth and delicious. He introduced me to his lovely wife who told me more of their history - their families came from the same small town in Sicily,  they've been in business for 3 1/2 years and they treat their customers like family. They do catering and they keep a stash of frozen eggplant Parmesan and lasagna (2 \"Italian\" servings meaning large) that you can take home and heat up for days you don't want to cook but want a home cooked meal. Also their imported meats and cheeses are about $10 cheaper than in grocery stores. Gotta try their gelato during their Summer months because that's the only time they offer it.   Can't praise this place enough for their hospitality,  customer service and their delicious authentic food."}
{"text":"Bit of a hidden location, but definitely seems to be no secret to the neighborhood. I walked in fairly late on a Wednesday evening so they were already cleaning up and getting ready to close. Sebastian and Ann were so welcoming anyway and asked me if I've been here before, what I'm looking for, and shared so much about their cafe. It's so refreshing to meet a couple who are so proud and passionate about their food! Makes the place even more homely and I can't wait to come back to try more!  This trip I ordered four cannolis, but as other yelpers have shared, you always leave with a little something extra. Sebastian ends up making five cannolis which I ate the extra on the way home and Ann packed up a wonderful smelling baguette for me! They are so sweet and happy and clearly put a lot of love into their food. Home made sauces and recipes!!   The cannolis have real ricotta filling and a sturdy shell that is not prefilled so you don't get that soggy feeling. My boyfriend and i thoroughly enjoyed these treats!!   On the weekends she's told me to come on back to try the delicious rice balls. I can't wait! They also squeeze their own lemons for a summer granita!! I have got to come back!!"}
{"text":"I went and ordered the chicken sandwich but then I suddenly noticed they served ice cream too. I then got a order of the Nocciola Hazelnut and Pistachio gelato. Man that ice cream was absolutely mind blowing good, just wow! (Its made in house)  Trust about the Sandwich: it was a very good sandwich with a lot of flavor in it, loaded with tomato sauce but some what dry but overall I liked.  However, I definitely go back here a thousand times just for that gelato thouuuuuuu."}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (4 stars) Tucked into the corner of a small non-descript plaza, Bodira is a local hidden gem. Parking is limited but the plaza is rarely busy. The bakery/diner/Italian grocery store is cozy and boasts a selection of various imported Italian goods. There are about 4 small tables inside and a couple patio seats outside during the summer.   SERVICE (5 stars) The owner and his wife are friendly and talkative. As a super timid, first time visitor, they made us feel welcome and gave recommendations for food items to try. Somehow, they even got us chatting with the table next to ours, who were also here for the first time.   FOOD (5 stars) We ordered two coffees, a cannoli, and a sweet bun they call \"La Bomba\". The coffees were nutty and tasted faintly of chocolate. The owner told us he blends the beans himself, which showed in the unique taste. The cannoli was fresh and crispy with a sweet creamy cheese fiilling. The Bomba though was the star of our meal. Lightly dusted with sugar, the airy bun was filled with sweet cream and chocolate chips. Surprisingly decadent but not heavy.   QUALITY/VALUE (4) Prices are reasonable for dessert/bakery items. I saw a sign for homemade vegetarian pastas for sale at $9 dollars, which is significantly steeper than their other menu items. They also sell gelatos and deli meats/cheeses.  OVERALL  4 stars - Would definitely return to try their arancini balls and other bakery items. We arrived at noon and lots of their pastries were sold out."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the weekend for some gelato for our daughter who lives on the stuff.  She got a small tub to go, half strawberry-half lemon that was sampled before we even got home.  Thumbs up!  So friendly also.  Wish we had found it at the beginning of summer."}
{"text":"Found this rare authentic small Italian cafe in the Boxgrove area, loved it!  Cozy, comfort food, they have imported ham and cheese from Italy, owner is friendly and nice. There's a stand up bar where you can have coffee and chat with the owner just like in Italy!  It's definitely a gem in the area. I'm not a big fan of Starbucks or chain fast food restaurants, I enjoyed this local cafe a lot.  Will come back for sure!  I had pasta with vegetables, very home-cooking like and tasty. They have a very good drink selection as well with reasonable price. All you have to do is ask."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this amazing little place while on the hunt for good coffee.  It is owner run/operated and we had a lovely time chatting with the owner while she explained her delicious offerings.  My husband ordered an Italian chicken sandwich, and being Italian, said it tasted just like something home-made.  Customers kept coming in for the cannoli and so we decided to order four to take home - the lovely lady brought two out for us to sample while we had coffee!  These were absolutely delicious.   We also took home some rice balls and these were also heavenly.  We cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Very good prices for actual Italian food, homemade cheeses for many pastries, very nice people, a great spot for Italian food in Markham. Oh and their coffee is great too.  This place doesn't look like a fancy place inside but the people, products, and prices are great! We come here all the time."}
{"text":"We discovered this place by chance after a ladies afternoon of nail pampering next door. We went in looking for a beverage and were greeted with delicious wafts of Italian food and gelato! No joke, 3 of us went in and 3 of us came out with gelato in a cones and in a takeaway pint - I even got a jar of their marinara sauce to go (along with water).  The marinara sauce was amazing that I brought my husband and daughter the next weekend. We stayed for a plate of penne with marinara and ofcourse gelato! This place is the real deal - and the owners are so so lovely   Ill definitely be back and can't wait to see you guys soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food does all the talking. Authentic italian food. This place isnt for fine dining. However, they make you feel like you  are a part of their family."}
{"text":"Went here on a bit of a whim...just looked up Italian places in the area...there seems to be a lack of consistent Italian food. This place is very authentic. Part grocery and part restaurant, they have a good selection on meats and cheeses and Italian packaged treats. Unfortunately, when we arrived around 6 on Friday they didn't have much food left. They informed us this was because it was almost close, although close wasn't till 7pm...so I guess this is more of a lunch place. That said they had one veal left and one penne pasta left. We bought them both. My toddler, who hates pasta usually, loved this pasta! And I agree with him. It was delicious. My husband liked the sandwich and I also took a bite and it was yummy.  We also bought some very expensive gelato, which was good (and apparently no preservatives, all natural, etc) but was very pricey at over $20 for the smallish tub. The sign in front of the gelato said large takeaway tub was $10...my husband paid, or I would have asked for clarification. I didn't know until after we left, so there was some miscommunication somewhere in there.  The couple were really lovely, gave my son a little chocolate thing for free and chatted with us while we waited.   I will definitely be back, especially to get more pasta, but one star off for running out of food before close and for overpriced gelato."}
{"text":"I have driven by this plaza countless times and never knew such a business was located in here. As many have said, Markham is severely lacking in small indie cafes. Chains like Starbucks, Tim Horton's and Second cup have dominated our market so we ned to support these smaller cafes!   Bodira is not just a cafe, however. They also have a small selection of what looks to be popular italian grocery foods. If you are missing something from Italy, speak to the owner of Bodira! He may be able to help you get some of what you are looking for.   The first thing I thought of trying was the coffee. The latte was admittedly a little bit underwhelming, but I believe this is simply because the milk was under-steamed. As long as the espresso is great- which it is- its really nothing that can't be fixed. Even with the under-steamed milk, it is definitely not one of the worst lattes that I have had.   It was a hot day, so obviously I had to try the gelato. It was much needed, but I was still not satisfied. I think I was a bit hungry, so after trying their gelato (which was awesome and very fairly priced @ $3.00 for a small cup), I went back in to order a sandwich.   When I went back in, the owner saw me and gave me a big smile and \"Hello!\". I told him I wanted to try another item on his menu and he was struck with excitement. With a thick italian accent, he listed \"Tortellini, Chicken, Veal\" just to name a couple of his offerings. I was in the mood for a veal parmesan sandwich after seeing one of the previous reviewers photos, so I went for one of those. The sandwich was great!! The veal was moist and the bread was soft. I must say that this made we want to come back again and try some more of Bodira's foods."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. Never knew it existed until I saw some people commenting on it on a forum. We took our entire family (kids and all), and the owners were great. What stole the show though was the food, it was stellar! Made for a fantastic lunch.  The place was busy too. Will definitely be back not just for cooked foods, but deli meats, cheeses, coffee, etc."}
{"text":"Walking into this store and being welcomed by their jolly owner felt just like walking into an Italian cafe should. This place is cozy and cute with great service. They offer items not found in your typical grocery store and quality food. Definitely a gem as others have mentioned"}
{"text":"Bodira Cafe is tucked at the corner of this little plaza at the corner and 14th Ave and Boxgrove By-Pass.  You can say it is a cafe as it does serves Espresso drinks and some counter for you to drink your morning coffee just like in Italy. Aside from that, there is a little round table for 2 where the owner chilling out with his friend when I walked in.  Cappuccino ($2.50) is nicely made and delicious went well with the complimentary EMMA Almond Biscotti. How he knows almond is my favourite?  Aside from drinks, there is also a great selection of groceries that are imported from Italian.  Really nice small coffee place, a great addition the the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"It's no secret that Markham has an espresso drought. A search on Yelp will display Dou Patisserie & Cafe, Aroma Espresso Bar and Second Cup as the top three \"best espresso\" contenders in the region.   After a long soul-wrenching search, my friend and I had finally landed at Bodira Cafe and Fine Foods. Bodira Cafe is a neighbourhood gem. Coffees are crafted in the Mercedes-Benz equivalent of Espresso Machine. The owner, Sebastian is a coffee concierge. He mixes and roasts the beans for the espresso in house. Ann, Sebastian's lovely wife shares his passion for coffee and conversations. Together they opened Bodira Cafe.   It was 9:00 AM in the morning. We were greeted warmly by Ann, the moment we stepped into the store. Ann suggested we try her infamous cannoli. With slight hesitation (as we had no intention to have cannoli for breakfast), we complied. We ended up ordering a cappuccino, a latte and a cannoli to share.  Our coffee was crafted carefully by Ann. The coffee did not disappoint. It was a great relief from the long Markham coffee drought. We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks - the aroma, the acidity, and the flavor.  The classic Sicilian cannoli, for me was the highlight! I have had my fair share of top notch cannoli in Toronto. Bodira Cafe has officially taken over the crown in the GTA. The crisp exterior of the shell is filled with subtly sweet ricotta.  It was the perfect contrast between textures and flavour - the hard and the soft, creaminess and crispness.   During our conversations, Ann discovers that my friend is a fellow coffee concierge. She insisted on offering my friend an espresso on the house. My friend purchased a bag of house roasted coffee after sampling the espresso. Upon paying for the coffee bean at the cash register, Sebastian offered my friend another cup of espresso on the house. My friend told Sebastian that his wife has already graciously served him a cup on the house. In response, Sebastian made a hand gesture, indicating that this cup will have four shots and whispered, \"this will be better cause I make it differently\" with a big smile.   Bodira Cafe is what I picture a visit to an Italian household would be like - warm Italian hospitality with generous hearts and delicious treats! Look forward to trying their arancini and addictives-free house-made gelato in the summer!"}
