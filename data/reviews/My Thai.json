{"text":"Had dinner here last Saturday night and do not plan to ever return.  Our meal started out with the Shrimp Rolls which came quick and very hot.  They were really good and we all enjoyed them a great deal.  After eating them we were very excited about the rest of our meal.  We ordered and then waited just under an hour for our entrees!  Our server, who was very unattentive, never came to the table to explain the delay.  I finally had to flag her down and ask what was going on in the kitchen  Her response was \"the kitchen is very backed up with take out orders\".  Well, what about the diners sitting in house waiting for their meals?  She never asked if we wanted another drink or water.  Again we had to get her attention and ask for water.  Finally, when our meals did come, they were a big disappointment.  We ordered medium spice and got no heat at all.  I really think they never added any spice to the meals.  The Raad Na was very, very salty.  The saltiness just overpowered the dish.  The Pad Thai was too sweet and the noodles were too chopped for my taste.  We left feeling very disappointed and vowed never to return."}
{"text":"President fried rice and the pad Thai are delicious!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Pineapple curry is delicious. Very fast service. One of the best Thai places I've been to around Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"My Thai is one of my favorite places to eat at! The service is great, the management is amazing - love 'em! And the food is my absolute favorite ...ever. I always get the Special pan fried noodles and I am never disappointed. My husband and I go here so often it's kind of ridiculous."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was not bad at all. Four levels of spice. Level two was perfect.  Plenty of room when we went.  They are able to accommodate  6-person families well."}
{"text":"The service was very good. The have a bar with 3 TVs and my lychee drink was very good as were the fresh summer rolls. My noodle dish was good, but I got a 2 out of 5 on the spice level and absolutely could have handled a 3. It was good by all means though I think the flavors are a bit more bold at Thai Spoon. My husband had the pumpkin curry and again it was good through the one at Nicki's Thai Kitchen is a bit better. It was not very busy but there was a lot of take out orders. I would go again, it would be a great place to watch a game and have some Thai food but it's not the best Thai I've ever had but it certainly was good. I do prefer the food down the road at Thai Spoon, but this place has a full bar and you're not crowded against the next table like you are at Thai Spoon."}
{"text":"I had My Thai again because it's been a couple years since I've had it and it's relatively close to my house for pick-up. 

Thankfully, the quality has not gone down since I was last there. I ordered online. It was really easy and I could see when they received the order and what time it would be ready to be picked up. Easy! 

I got the crab rangoon. I like it a lot because the won ton wrapper is really light and crispy. The filling is awesome, too. Light and sweet. There were 6 pieces in the order. Most places only have 4, so that's awesome. 

The chicken pad thai was good, too. I asked for it spicy and I got it spicy! The portion was huge. I couldn't eat half of it. Good for lunch tomorrow, I guess! 

I guess I kind of forgot about them for a while. I don't think I'll wait another two years to head back."}
{"text":"My first visit to this relatively new Thai offering.  I am so pleased to have this reasonably priced, solid menu, casual Thai restaurant in the South Hills!
The service is polite and friendly, as well as helpful if you are not a Thai regular.
I had the Duck Curry.  My Son had Thai Noodle Curry. 
The heat levels go from 1-5 and they will caution you accordingly.
I rate my Curry at a solid 4.  My son is about the same...he asked for more heat after sampling, the wait staff was quick to remedy!
They have a full battery, however I had the Jasmine tea, which was a great compliment to the meal.
I look forward to trying their weekday lunch specials which include many different curries at under $8, including salad!

If you want a casual, authentic Thai experience that won't strip your budget, I highly recommend \"My Thai\"."}
{"text":"Everything said about the Crab Rangoon is true.  Excellent flavor, and not sweet (as is true of way too many restaurants in CU).  Hubby's Panang Curry was very good.  My Pad Thai was good, but different than that of typical Thai restaurants.  I don't know if I'd order it again; not because of quality, but because it wasn't like what I've had at Thara Thai or Golden Wok.  Bathroom clean too -- always a plus!"}
{"text":"It's alright. I ordered the pad Thai and it's just mediocre taste but high price ($13)."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had in US. I love the lava chicken and the Thai fried rice. My girlfriend loves the Yummy rolls."}
{"text":"Food and service never disappoint. Quiet, relaxing atmosphere and a scenic view of the gas station on Springfield. It's the classiest place within a half mile radius."}
{"text":"We have a small family disagreement over whether this or Siam Terrace is better, but since they are owned by the same people, it's pretty much the same thing.  

Great drunken noodles, especially with tofu. The green curry is nicely spicy, whatever you get in it. The thai soups are less reliable -- we've had tom ka gai a few times, and it less tangy, less spicy and more just plain milky than we typically like."}
{"text":"Thara Thai was closed so we went to My Thai.  I had the green curry and it was not nearly as good as Thara's.  It's a decent back-up plan to Thara Thai but if Thara is open, go there."}
{"text":"I've been to My Thai a number of times for dinner and lunch and have always had a good experience.  For my birthday I got the sashimi boat and the presentation was beautiful!  I've had a variety of sushi and pad thai there and everything has been up to par!  And the onion salad dressing is terrific! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great for a dinner out (or takeout) if you want to avoid the typical bar/grill fare in the neighborhood. Excellent flavor at a good price. We always get the karee puff appetizer, though they would benefit from a little more filling."}
{"text":"This is not a very good restaurant and does not represent Thai food at all. There is potatoe in everything. I was born and raised in Chicago and have been to dozens upon dozens of Thai restuarants and have never come across Idaho potatoes in any dish. My Thai put it into every dish, no doubt as filler. I ordered Pad Se Ew and the waitress didn't even know what it was. The fact that this place has 3.5 stars on it really makes me question the ratings of other restaurants."}
{"text":"I drove past a few times and said to myself, wasn't that a bar a couple weeks ago? Were they really able to open it up into a restaurant that quick? Yes! And the food is amazing!!!! The staff was extremely welcoming and my pineapple chicken curry gave life! Not to mention the delicious cocktails as well! There is no doubt they will be seeing a lot of me and my husband!"}
{"text":"First time going to My Thai today. My lunch was okay -- nothing spectacular. I was hoping to bring leftovers home for dinner, but the lunch portion is pretty small. In addition, the \"salad\" is basically a few pieces of lettuce, a slice of cucumber, and a half-slice of tomato. It's TINY. So just don't count on that providing any satiation. In terms of portion, I'd go to Peking Garden (not Thai, I know) over My Thai.

I did try my friends' lunches (which were off the full menu), and they were much better. Don't know if it's just a dedicated lunch menu thing, but when I go back (which I will because I love Thai and don't want to have to drive across town to get it), I'll order off the full menu."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise! This is an excellent Thai restaurant in an unassuming strip mall in Chesterland, OH. Clean, beautiful decor, professional service and fantastic food! I am thrilled with this find."}
{"text":"Was disappointed about the service and I only ordered for take out. Asked if they had Pho as it was not on the menu, was told yes, disappointed not tasty at all, no lime no cilantro. Might try again."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Pad Woon Sen and egg rolls.  The egg rolls were very good, not over cooked and mushy.  The Pad Woon Sen was very good, the vegetables were fresh and cooked well so they still had some crispness to them, but weren't raw.  There was plenty of chicken in the dish, they don't scrimp on portions.  Service was good, place is clean.  I will eat there again."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner.  I had the Shrip Mango Curry - wonderfully sweet and spicy.  It was a special item and not a regular menu item but I wish it was!  He splurged and got the Crispy Duck - so worth it, just melts in your mouth and the sauce served with it complemented it beautifully.  I'm not a huge fan of their Tom Yum Gai Soup, I like Siam Terrace's version better,  but the Pinky in a Blanket appetizer was really good.  The place is clean, staff is friendly and they make a mean Thai Iced tea - I'd reccomend it."}
{"text":"I love to see good new restaurants in this area of the South Hills... Dormont is on a major upswing, in large part due to the small business owners.  My Thai should help.

The d√©cor is really nice, and the place is big and open.  I am a bit concerned about the size of the place in relation to the # of people it has been drawing in -- diners will really need to start turning out for this place to last.

Overall, the food is quite good.  There is a touch of \"foodie-ness\" to the way they approach Thai food, which has its pros and cons.  There are a few surprises in their bites, from appetizers to mains, but the portions are a bit smaller than you would expect for what you are paying.

There is some strong competition in the area, just a couple of blocks away.  The food here may be on par and slightly more inventive, but the portions are a little smaller and about $2/plate more expensive.

I think they can command the $2/plate more, but they will need to up the amount of food they give you for that price.  For example, the appetizer sampler platter ($10) consisted of 2 very small spring rolls; 3 very small dumplings, and 3 medium-sized chicken satays --- with dipping sauce.  At the very least, the spring rolls should be bigger than a bite, and there should be more dumplings.  The sauces crushed the amount of food on the sampler.

Similarly, my main (seafood platter, $17) just didn't have enough \"stuff\" (even light on the veggies) to justify the price -- although the curry paste sauce was quite tasty and inventive.

Also, a middle-grade beer was $6 ... and it had quite a bit of foam on top.

All said, there's some strong potential here -- but they better fine-tune quickly.  Start by giving more for your money, and it might justify the cost."}
{"text":"We've visited 3 times now and will definitely dine there as a regular stop.  Curries are amazing.  Service is exceptional."}
{"text":"I was not a huge fan, but it may have been because my initial impressions (restaurant's ambiance was \"blah\") we not great. The food was tasty. I order the panang curry; i enjoyed it, but would have appreciated some more vegetables and less sauce in the dish. I would head back (if I were in the mood for Thai food and was in the area)."}
{"text":"I like their food but sadly their service is horrible. I was trying to place a delivery order, but the guy in the restaurant put me on hold for 10 minutes. I hung up and called back, and she denied doing this immediately and argued for herself, and finally she ended up with \"do you want to place the order or not\". This is something I would never expect a server to say. I asked for her name afterwards, she just hung up directly. I mean, can you believe it? You gonna take responsibility for what you said. Extremely horrible service, will not order anything from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Spicy crunchy roll is sooo delicious! It's definitely my favorite! it's a great combination of just the saltiness but yet the rice is a little sweet and then the sauce is just so tasty u have to try it! and if ur a 1st timer eating sushi this is a good start cause the tuna is fully cooked! ...just wished it was a little more budget-friendly trust me we would b in this place 2-3 times a week!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever had. And it's not too far. Also we know the owners and they are the kindest people! Love it."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I got lunch with a friend on a Wednesday afternoon and there were only a few other people there. It has a very welcoming and comforting ambience. The location is great. There is cheap parking behind the building (turn in by the post office) and there is basically floor to ceiling windows with great natural light that faces Liberty Avenue. 

The service was good. All the employees were very polite and nice and stopped by frequently to make sure we were enjoying our food and had enough water. The food itself was very good. I had pineapple friend rice with chicken which was delicious. The lunch special is only $7.95 and I had enough to take home with me. It also came with a small side salad and a small egg role. I also got the crab rangoons. I thought they were good, but too sweet. They weren't bad and that is more of a personal taste thing that a cooking mistake. 

I would highly recommend it. Two meals, an appetizer, and a tea came out to only $26 :)"}
{"text":"I order for delivery and it got to my house really fast. I order the chefs pick on sushi 6 pieces and let me tell you!! It was so nasty! I got 2 pieces some kind of white fish no flavor and it was like mooch the crab of curse it was imitation which I was expecting,and one pieces with shrimp, but the one with the piece of salmon was fucking disgusting it smell so old you have no idea I never smell something like that I can't believe they have the balls to serve food like that!!! I also got the spicy red curry with chicken it was ok veggies were kind of old too.  I'm never eating at this place ever again,this was my first and last."}
{"text":"YUM! This place is sooo good.   The Zombie Roll is fire,  But beware they don't serve Sushi on Tuesdays!  The Tom Yung Ghai (sp?)  is the most delicious soup I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Ordered the green curry - it was very good. The only reason I did not give it a five-star rating was the spice level. I indicated that I wanted very little - as in almost no - spice.  It was probably more like a 3 on a 0-5 scale when I was envisioning more like a 1.  In the future, I will just be sure to indicate that more precisely. Overall, the food was great, the service was very good; my husband was happy with what he ordered also, and the dessert and drinks were also very tasty."}
{"text":"I was driving back to my office from an appointment in the West Valley this morning, and I was thinking to myself how I really wanted some Thai food for lunch. I was thinking of picking up something at Thai House or Swaddee, but before I could make up my mind, I saw the sign...My Thai...I figured I would give it a go! 

The restaurant is very clean and nice inside, with mostly booth seating. There is a large granite bar on one side. I placed my order to go and had a less than 10 minute wait for my food. 

I ordered the lunch #3, the Beef Panang Curry, which was served with rice, a chicken spring roll and a side salad. The curry was the best panang curry I have ever had. It was smooth and creamy, and had just enough heat to keep you coming back for more. I was most impressed with the beef, it was so tender, it almost melted in your mouth....and this was all after a 20 minute drive back to my office! 

The menu is well priced and I will definitely go back. I just wish it was closer to the area that I live in, but now I will have to schedule all my West Valley appointments near lunchtime!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait until this place opened--so excited to have such a good Thai restaurant in West Champaign.  The food was awesome and I can't complement the servers and staff enough.  Every one of them went out of their way to both make sure our needs were met as well as to entertain my 1 year old with extreme friendliness.  Love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very good selection of dishes, particularly vegetarian.  In a town with lots of pizza, fast food, mainstream Chinese take out, oh-let's not forget the bar/burger/deep fried joints where only the name changes- My Thai is a refreshing option & the chic minimalist decor is very appropriate for the ambience a small, specially cuisine wants to project. I love their food,  Drunken Noodles is my personal fave. While I'm not an expert on Thai cuisine, I have traveled worldwide and sampled Thai dining upon occasion. My Thai is well priced, service fast & friendly, and every dish I've sampled has been unique, fresh, and tasty. I think it's a great option in an area where there are few to choose from.

{"text":"Great Thai restaurant in west Champaign.   The menu offers a nice variety of stir fry, noodles, and currys. My favorite dish to order there is the lava chicken. Other dishes there haven't disappointed me as well."}
{"text":"They have awesomest mock duck curry in Champaign... It gets all 5 stars... The chicken satay and tom yum are good... But not the best... But nothing much to take from... So they get 4"}
{"text":"Deeply disappointed. I moderately like Siam Terrace, but this is much worse. Yes, good crab rangoons, people are not wrong about that. Perhaps they should open a crab rangoon stand. 

Meh miso soup. Meh noodles. (Called drunken noodles. Perhaps it refers to the state of the chef? Just kidding (-: ) Stale-feel seafood (too many years in the freezer) in the expensive Bangkok seafood dish. The soft shell crab was an expensive joke. Two incompetently fried (I do it better) undernourished crabs, for almost twenty bucks. Microscope needed to detect the poor animals. Not enough meat to feed a cat. On a bed of cheap, tasteless lettuce leaves which might have seen better days, a while ago.

Highly overpriced place with food ranging between barely OK and undermediocre. Avoid and then avoid some more. Bottom line: avoid."}
{"text":"Love their prices and Pad See Ew. Conveniently located and quick service. Probably best Thai food in C-U."}
{"text":"Tried several of the curry dishes and always a treat.  Inside is small but I always get take out.  Quick and friendly service.  Would recommend the Satay as an appetizer and the Panang or Red Curry dishes.  The Pad Thai with chicken or tofu is also exceptional.  

If your in the area and looking for Thai, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I was forced into My Thai by my daughter on Labor Day, sort of. We had just got done with shopping, and the evil twin had a taste for something Asian. This would be our second time eating here, I just never got around to reviewing our first trip. 

We stopped in around 3, and the restaurant was empty, but we were warmly greeted by Fawn our waitress who sat us next to one of the large windows looking out onto W. Liberty Ave. 

The menu isn't jam packed or confusing, daughter ordered Pad Thai, and I got the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with seafood added. We both chose heat level 4, but ended up needing a few extra spoons of Thai chili, and hot sauce.

The Pad Thai looked really good, with tofu, and a mixture of vegetables. Daughter said it wasn't salty (like some other places), or mushy. 
My Tom Yum Noodle Soup, was flavorful, and had a nice mixture of seafood (octopus rings, mussels, shrimp and pieces of fish. The broth was a blend of fish sauce, lemongrass, and or beef broth. Sweet, savory, and tangy if that makes sense. Overall yumminess, the noodles were rice noodles, nicely chewy and the bok choy bright green with freshness. 

We shared the Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango for dessert, just let me eat sweet sticky rice with coconut milk every day. 
The service was friendly, and the food hit the spot."}
{"text":"Located on a very busy stretch of W. Liberty Avenue lies My Thai. I believe this used to be an old bar and they still have the bar inside and serve alcoholic beverages, but I came here for their delicious Thai food. The chili paste with green beans and chicken was nicely spiced. Their space scale goes from 1-5 and a 4 was pretty spicy-but that's okay by me as I love my spicy food. They also offer bubble tea. I'll have to come back and try the lunch specials during the week which are very affordable. Keep up the great food and service My Thai!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai lacked flavor (not enough fish oil I imagine), but my family enjoyed the rice dishes and spring rolls very much!"}
{"text":"GREAT food.  I get the Yakisoba with no carrots or mushrooms a lot.  But everything is good from their menu.   The service is excellent.   

Their water tastes like pool water.   That's about the only bad thing about it.  Get a soda and enjoy your dinner.   It's a great place to have a relaxing meal.  They are never super busy, which is a great thing.   The setting is comfortable."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. This place, in my opinion, was just so so. I wasn't expecting much for seafood in mid-illinois so I was not disappointed. What I would recommend is the Surprise Roll. Tell the chef what you like and do not like, he will definitely whip up something that suits your taste! And please don't get the squid salad or whatever it is called... It was HORRIBLE. The squid tasted like it just came straight out of a freezer (it probably did since it was partially frozen). I was worried for a while that I would get sick from it but so far so good..."}
{"text":"Spring and shrimp rolls were very good. Good Thai place in convenient location. Enjoyed it"}
{"text":"If you are looking for sushi (or several other things on the menu), make sure to call ahead.  No sushi when we were there on a Tuesday night.  

Overall, okay....prices were really high compared to what the restaurant was.  It looks like an old diner inside based upon the booths and tables. Not dirty, but definitely didn't appear clean; overall very worn.

We had calamari and crab rangoon for appetizers.  Both were good, but really small portions for the price.  I had the President Rice (rice with shrimp and chicken) and it was really good after adding some hot sauce.  He got the yakisoba and said that it reminded him of off-brand spagetti o's, but with noodles.  What we ordered was our 2nd, 3rd, 4th choices because they said that they didn't have them that evening because the sushi cook was out, even though we weren't trying to order sushi.....

Service was really slow and we had to ask for water refills, ask to order.  Not a place that I would ever go back to.  I saw all the really good reviews for it, but I just didn't see it or experience it in my visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. They were very good in their old location, but have reached an unbelievable new high with the new location.

Had peanut curry for the first time on my first visit to new location. WOW! Amazing yummy chows."}
{"text":"This is a fairly solid establishment. The only miss we've had is with the green Papaya salad. Otherwise we've been satisfied with the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Delicious curry. A courteous, efficient and welcoming staff. A most lucky find, considering we were just passing through!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It's cozy.   Staff is friendly and food is great.   Always get the brown rice especially if you don't like brown rice. Get it!"}
{"text":"My parents had wanted to go to My Thai for a while since it had opened. Thus I was dragged along. When we had gotten to the restaurant there was one car in the parking lot. Immediately I had the feeling that it was going to be bad. I mean no cars and it's almost 1 o'clock. When we were seated my mom told me that she had seen the sushi guy picking his nose...... so i didn't get the sushi. What really disappointed me was that the lunch menu didn't apply to weekends. The reason why was mainly due to the overpriced food! Don't get me wrong I thought the food was good, just kind of overpriced for a lunch. The service was also great, mainly due to lack of customers. I will defiantly be in no rush of coming back to the restaurant but if i have to, the lunch menu is probably the way to go. Oh and about the sushi, ignorance is bliss. :)"}
{"text":"We had the nigiri appetizer, Basil Duck, crazy roll, and smokey mountain roll. The nigiri was chefs choice, and was a fair spread for the price. The nigiri was probably the best part of the meal. The duck was supposed to be crispy and fried, but it ended up coming out as heavily breaded bits of duck junk -- lots of gristle. The rolls looked really bad -- it looked nothing like the other pictures on yelp, but rather amateurish. Just rolls sitting in a pool of mayo, with some orange roe sprinkled on top. We could hardly even tell the rolls apart! The rolls didn't hold together well, either. The crazy roll was little eel and mostly asparagus, while the smokey mountain was very heavy with cream cheese and contained a barely noticeable amount of smoked fish (upon dissection). I definitely left feeling dissatisfied, and the bill was paid with much regret."}
{"text":"My thai has great curry and excellent noodle stir-fry dishes. The green curry is delicious (but super spicy). And the Crab Rangoon. I can't say enough about that stuff. I'm not an appetizer girl, but I get an order every single time. It comes out so fresh out of the fryer it melts in your mouth and the dipping sauce perfect. 

Only aspects I don't like are: 1) the slightly depressing strip-mall-esque atmosphere, 2) the lack of noodle soups. Why no noodle soup?"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Curry came out a little cold but it was sooooo good there was no way we was sending it back. Clean and upscale environment."}
{"text":"I have always had a perfect experiences at this restaurant. I go there frequently since I work right up the road. The food is flavorful, the dining area is spotless. The staff always brings lovely conversation, as well as a smile, to my face! I love their pumpkin entrees, satay, spring rolls, fresh squeezed OJ, and pineapple fried rice. My Thai has a very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere perfect for business meetings or a quick lunch break during the work day. I just ate there today for lunch during my break and it made my day! I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I reviewed the wrong place by mistake the first time. My apologies to My Thai!!!"}
{"text":"It was nice... the food needs to be more flavored!
more dominant. 
We took the dragon shrimp for beginning it was great! 
I took the Japanese style noodles i don't remember the name it was nice.
and my brother took the lobster soup, this was pretty good!

Will recommend to others but won't come back so excited.."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE my thai!! Great pad thai and crab rangoon. We get it delivered at least 2x a month and it's always great."}
{"text":"I feel at home visiting My Thai in Dormont. My Thai restaurant has a very pleasant and friendly staff who keep a clean dining room and facilities. I have eaten there for lunch and dinner and always left knowing that I made the right dining choice.
My favorite dishes are the Thai Red Curry Chicken and the Thai Basil Fried Rice. The lunch special is awesome because it comes with a nice salad and an egg roll along with the entree. 
I have tried many restaurants in Dormont and Mt Lebanon and my favorite is My Thai!"}
{"text":"I've only recently discovered My Thai, but I'm glad I finally did!  They're my new favorite for lunch at work.  Their online ordering is super easy and it's always on time when I go to pick it up (super fast)!  Although I've yet to explore most of the menu, I haven't had a bad sushi roll or appetizer yet!"}
{"text":"Love the Tofu Panang Curry and their lemongrass soup is wonderful! It has a pleasant interior, great service and very decent wine & beer list. I love that on their 1-5 spice scale that their \"hot\" (level 3) is actually hot! Significantly spicy but you can still taste all the spice complexity. I am so tired of going to places with a 1-10 scale, and ordering an 8 and either getting something that is still super mild or something so hot you cannot taste the curry anymore. My Thai understands depths of flavor. Order their curry and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I gave this place another chance and was pleasantly surprised. I tried 2 rolls (one specialty and one smaller one) and the crab rangoon to-go. Very tasty and I enjoyed it all. Now that being said, while it was better that my first experience, I still felt it was terribly over priced for the quality of it. My meal was $26 and I wasn't blown away by anything. The service again was very wonderful and I think this place is trying it's best. Perhaps their sushi just isn't for me. I will try it again but next time just try their Thai food."}
{"text":"So I finally gave My Thai a shot. I was completely disappointed. Thai Orchid is a much better option.  If I am going out for thai, I would rather have people who have actually lived there prepare it for me."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service not much more you can ask for, so if you're ever in dormont you should check this spot out. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Very good pineapple duck.  very bland Scallop dish.  Delivery driver was way nice, and the online ordering experience was smooth.  I should have known that \"big scallops\" in Champaign might be 1\"d.  Kinda my fault on that I guess.  I will try again for sure, and rock pure Thai dishes next time."}
{"text":"Came in based off of the reviews and I am glad I did.  Menu has a large variety of items to select from. Prices are more than reasonable.  The staff was very attentive even though I was ordering carry out!  The nice lady brought me water while I waited. Not sure why they don't have more people in here.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a very good place and the service is the best. The only reason I am rating 3 is because the tofu was not soft. The Manager said that we should specifically order for the one which is not fried/sauted. I am not aware of it though. But I am sure I will go there again :)"}
{"text":"I am not a huge Thai fan, but My Thai is delicious! I don't understand why the restaurant always seems so empty. The staff is incredible and very attentive. The menu has a great selection and is inexpensive. I love noodle bowls and My Thai has one of the best Tom yum noodle bowls I've ever had. The curry is also very good.  Great lunch specials as well! Once, my husband & I got take out and it wasn't very great, you must eat inside! Something tastes different when they package it to-go. Service is fast, servers are welcoming, and the atmosphere is relaxing.  I would recommend My Thai to anyone! Give it a try."}
{"text":"This place can make you fall ill in a minute.  I ordered crispy tofu and had a sick stomach as I got out.  A spoiler alert if you are thinking of a date night up there.  Might never forgive them for the bad experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai in Champaign/ Urbana.  Had the staples... Crab Rangoon then Pad Thai....crab rangoon was crisp and thin with filling that wasn't the usual super sweet, it was sweet and savory!  Pad Thai was fresh and not greasy.   Food was amazing ,service was prompt and friendly..table and restaurant were clean.  

I will go back and I recommend My Thai"}
{"text":"This is a half step down from Map of Thailand downtown, but pretty darn good in its own right.  The spiciness can be \"adjusted\" to the diner's liking, so they say, but it is never spicy enough for me.  The green curry is sort of bland and not to my standard.  Thai Orchid is even more to my liking.  Because it is conveniently located I occasionally stop in and dine, but I sure wouldn't drive 30 miles just to eat here, as I do to Map of Thailand."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place in town! Ordered it on a long shot for delivery and was shocked by how awesome the spicy California rolls are. Best crab Rangoon I've ever had, and their pad thai is really good. Dependable, delicious, and can be delivered. Can't get any better."}
{"text":"I go to My Thai at least twice a month, my FAVORITE place to eat sushi. The food is amazing, the service is impeccable, takeout is great there is not one negative thing I can say about this place. Every time I am there the sushi tastes great, I have never gotten sick or questioned the quality of fish. The service is great, I love the ladies who work there they are very attentive and nice. I don't know why the average rating isn't higher because I've never had a negative experience here and I will continue to binge on sushi every couple weeks"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! For meatlovers and vegetarians alike, you'll find something delicious. Our favorites are the pineapple curry and the pumpkin curry. It is a walkable distance for mt lebanon and dormont residents. The staff are all very courteous and on Thursdays they have dancers who are great!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try out this Thai place down the road from us for awhile now and I will say it did not disappoint last night!  We have been looking for a decent Thai places in the South Hills and I think we found our favorite spot! We started with the pork dumplings as our appetizer and the dipping sauce it came with was amazing, so much flavor!  My husband got the pad thai with shrimp at level 5 (we like spice) and he said it was much better than our original favorite spot in the city.  I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with tofu at a level 3.  It was spicy but a great flavorful spice.  The portion sizes were large so if you are looking to eat a lot of good Thai, this is the place!  We will absolutely be back there soon!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few years ago when they were in their previous location. I remembered how good it was, so we ordered tonight.  WARNING:  If you order Sweet n Sour chicken or Pad Se Ew with chicken, there won't be hardly any chicken in it.  I was shocked at how little there was, and I dug around in both dishes when my hubby and son commented on their dishes.  It was all sauce and noodles and veggies. I ordered the Panang Curry, which is only sauce and chicken with some Thai basil, so there was no hiding among any veggies, so there was A LOT of chicken in mine.  The satay was under-salted.  The spring rolls were good. My Panang curry was under-salted as well.  The Pad Se Ew and Sweet N Sour chicken tasted REALLY GOOD but again, where is the chicken?  That is what you pay for.  Wildly inconsistent with the amount of meat in the dishes so either 1) say something when you order, 2) order chicken on the side, or 3) go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed.  Actually disappointed.  Needs work.  I don't even think anyone Asian works here."}
{"text":"Great local place. Great food and sushi. Atmosphere was sparce and the serivce was not the best. The Crab Rangoon is amazing. Its not sweet like other places in town. Seemed a bit pricey but the portions are good, we came home with leftovers."}
{"text":"Overall, just ok.  Dad got Pad Thai and it was too spice and average overall.  I got some type of thai mixed seafood platter that was solid.  Also ordered a sushi roll but there was a mixup with the server so it came much later in the meal.  Nothing bad, but also nothing remarkable.  Too expensive for the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and I am not disappointed! The food is delicious! I had the Tom Yum Gai soup and Thai Rice. Definitely will order again ."}
{"text":"Lava Chicken...one of the best dishes I have had and always get!  The pad Thai is pretty decent too, but the flavors have varied a lot.  In my opinion, you can't go wrong with their Lava Chicken though."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai food but sadly, I'm not a fan of My Thai. I felt this restaurant really cut corners with their food and the food quality was very low compared to other Thai restaurants I've been to, especially when compared to competitor Thai Spoon right down the street.  

The Pad Thai was super dry and bland. Pineapple curry had a sprinkling of peas and carrots (the pre-chopped frozen kind) throughout what was mainly broth. Tofu was my protein of choice for both dishes and it was tough and chewy, which you could tell wasn't very fresh. 

Considering there are other Thai restaurants in the area that have consistently delivered on quality and taste, I don't think I'll visit My Thai again."}
{"text":"I pulled off I-57 on my way back to Chicagoland after finding this place on my handy iPhone app.  

The Red Curry chicken was very good, served piping hot. The veggie rolls were fresh tasting and better with some hot sauce along side the peanut dipping sauce. 

The service was friendly and worth it was worth the stop."}
{"text":"Thank god this place is no longer a sub-par Dormont dive bar. I've been here two or three times, and each time it was a fantastic experience. If you like thai food, this is definitely your place. The pad thai is legitimately the best pad thai I've ever had. They go on a 1 to 5 scale of spiciness, and I got a 2 (which is still fairly hot for me at least). The atmosphere is very relaxed and I've never seen more than 4 other people in here at any one time. Overall, I would say give it a shot if your looking for goof asian cuisine in the south hills."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options. Their pad thai is AMAZING!!!! The green curry isn't as good as peppermint thai but this place is worth going to. The ambiance is a little awkward as there is no music playing."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm used to Thai food from LA so I would only give this place 3 stars. For lunch, it's cheap, right on a student's budget of less than $10 a meal. But, the food was just not what I was used to. I love love love green curry but the one I ordered came out looking more like gray curry. There was no hint of sweetness that I was used. A little disappointing, but I didn't complain since I was hungry.

Their redeeming quality, however, was the service. Excellent, friendly staff that took the liberty to split the bill for the entire table for us. They will probably be the only reason I come back."}
{"text":"Not very good. First time eating here, I had chicken pad Thai and crab Rangoon to go. The total was $20 for not very much food. The pad Thai was bland, looks like it was just thrown together In a hurry. Crab Rangoon was nothing special, the red sauce was sweet and incredibly salty."}
{"text":"Very nice people, I was working across the street and stopped in and had the luncheon special(take out). Pineapple chicken fried rice was great came with a salad and spring roll. plenty of food. great food at mcdonalds prices. the server was very kind.. even giving me take out water and another water while waiting for the food at the bar. I would like to return for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Wow! What a gem! After passing this place a hundred times we stopped for a late dinner. The service is amazing. 
The food is phenomenal!
I love that u can get ur pad Thai at any spiciness level starting at none...for people like me with kids!
My daughter had the mango juice and I the mango mojito which were a great compliment to our meals.
A good beer selection as well.
The dumplings tho were just phenomenal! Most authentic style dumplings! The way u can customize ur sauce with the pepper flakes and their chile sauce which complimented anything!
Parking can be a pain...actually it can just plain suck!
But a block or two walk is worth it!"}
{"text":"No good - the only reason I'm giving even 2 stars is because the green curry was ok. The chicken satay was terrible, the pad Thai was not good the noddles were all broken and mushy and the shrimp tasted like it was just thrown in at the end, no peanuts on it and it was served with a lemon... Sorry we went there - I thought this was going to be a good experience given the other reviews."}
{"text":"Great thai food, excellent vegetarian options, very family friendly.my new favorite place.  The mock duck is outstanding."}
{"text":"This is family owned place.  The husband is Mexican, he learned how to cook when he worked for a Thai restaurant in his days.  So for me who loves Thai food and visited Thai several times, the flavor is not authentic.  It is very americanized.  
We had the yellow curry and Pad Thai.  The yellow curry, it contained to much coconut in the dish and was made it very creamy so it doesn't even taste like curry.
The pad Thai, was to sweet!  I think he was sugar happy and added to much .
They don't have the sticky rice like other Thai restaurants, just regular rice.  :(
I was disappointed.  But in chesterland, OH there are NO variety!  This is the only Thai restaurant so if you are desperate for Thai, and no option is the like the only place!"}
{"text":"Alright where do I start... I walk in and it seems to be a nice quiet place, but I am soon to find out that that's the best thing about this place. Three tables came in, maybe 15 min after me and my date. They were served appetizers and entrees before we even got our appetizer. The waiter was like a ghost coming out only to serve others and ignoring eye contact with me. I had to flag him down several times to get proper service and when the food finally came out it was badly arranged and in miniature portions especially for the outstanding price. After my date had a stomach ache and had to get pepto at a local store. Horrible, I will never eat there again! If you want Asian food in Chesterland, go to Hunan, or Whi sun this place was disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I had the yakisoba and my boyfriend had sushi. We both thought the food was good and decently priced. I will return."}
{"text":"I have been here 2x. The service is friendly and attentive and the food is very good. Apparently this place has been in business for nearly 5 years! It's a wonder that a place like this could survive in Chesterland --- home to outdated bars with burger and wing nights....and fast food...and pizza. If you need a reason to travel to Chesterland, consider finding some great bargains at the WomenSafe second hand shop in the Drug Mart plaza, then treat yourself to lunch at my Thai.
Thanks my Thai, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"There new location is fabulous.. the food is always consistent and delicious.. My husband always gets sweet and sour pork and every time is great. There curry dishes are all yummy. i have tried many dishes and all have been very enjoyable.. If they have crab cakes as a special be sure to try them.. Nicest people and wait staff.. We are lucky to have this great restaurant in Chesterland.. Ga pa Guy order with the fried egg"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!!!  In champaign for memorial day and hubby and I was looking for thai place.  We decided to give My Thai a try!  Man are we happy that we did.  We were in a bit of a time crunch so we ordered take out.  Once we got to the restaurant, we decided to eat in.  

I ordered the pad thai with shrimp and pork and the dish was divine.  So good!  It was so flavorful and just the right spice level. The thai flavors were all there, it tasted very authentic. The portion size was amazing, the shrimp were large and juicy, the pork was of good quality.  I seriously can not say enough good things about the dish.

Husband ordered the drunken noodles and he had the same experience with the dish that I had with the pad thai.  He said the flavors were on point, he had no complaints. 

We also ordered a side of coconut milk soup with chicken.  The soup was amazing, the flavor was the perfect combination between sour and sweet.  The spice level was just like I liked it and the chicken was succulent.  Again no complaints.  We definitely can not wait to return to this establishment to try out there other dishes.  I think we have just found our go to spot for Thai food in champaign!!!"}
{"text":"Very very good restaurant ... Small, nice establishment ... Great service !
Definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Huge portions. I like how they let you choose your spice on every dish. Our waitress seemed unqualified. She brought me the wrong drink and didn't really know the menu. Spring rolls were a 3/5. The crispy noodles were very unique. I highly recommend trying them. The outside of the building always looks closed. I would go back again and try something else othe very large menu. It was probably a 3.5 overall but since I cant do that I'll give it a four."}
{"text":"First time visitor. The food was extremely fresh and delicious. spring rolls very yummy. Tom Kah soup so good. For my main course I ordered 2 peppers on the hotness scale, it was more like a 6. The seafood eggplant dish was loaded with seafood, very good.  My husband and another guest at our table had a chicken veggie dish. Both complained it lacked vegetables. Although our server was very nice, the food took way to long to arrive, and everyone's meal arrived at different times. The kitchen is producing good food, they just need to work on coordinating their timing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! I had the pad see ew and it was so fresh and tasty! We went with a larger group of people and we all had amazing meals! The food is so fresh and you can tell they put their heart into there dishes! Definitely a must if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Being located out in Chesterland I did not know what to expect but this place ended up being AMAZING.

Great food at a great price! Get the house soup! Nice service and a warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch one Sunday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised.  The decor is really nice and very tasteful, and the service was beyond excellent.  Everything we ordered was delicious and fresh and the peanut sauce is so good I could have just asked for a glass of it to drink.  The chicken fried rice also wonderful.  Everything was spiced just right.  We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken Pad Thai. The service is great food is nice and fresh. The hot tea is great for a cold day."}
{"text":"I don't know why my review is in stark contrast to the others on here but my food was not good. I ordered Pad See Ou as take out with mild spice. It had absolutely no flavor. It could have just been cooked noodles and saut√©ed vegetables. I did arrive before the food was ready so I'm worried they just forgot the sauce in an effort to not keep me waiting. I will try them again in the hope of a better result."}
{"text":"Eye pleasing colors/interior decor. They had pleasant Thai music playing. 

I got pad thai chicken as well as the cashew nut entrees. A bowl of tom kha soup. All were excellent and exceeded my expectations. This is coming from someone who has dined @ nicky's thai kitchen many times.  the flavor density of the cashew nut dish was amazing .  they've got it dialed in, just right , to my taste buds . the tom kha was neither too watery/thin nor mucky .  (some places like Thai spoon water the soups down much too much .)

Prices are high-ish but, this place is definetly 'better' than Thai Spoon, around the corner. the portion size of the tom kha soup was small .  nicky's thai kitchen gives you nearly twice the volume of soup for the same price .  the cashew nut stir-fry was on the skimpy/small side, as well .  true that this was a \"lunch special\" portion but , i'm a hungry American male and I like a big lunch . you pay nearly $5 more for the full-size entree portion ... 

*parking* could be problematic if you're driving here because there is very limited on-street metered parking unless you get creative and find one of the residential streets to park on, some of which are one-way only .  

despite these issues, i'm sure I will be back to dine, again and try other items on the menu which all looked good in words.  
Dormont and the South PGH / South hills areas, in general are much better off with the addition of \"My Thai\" ."}
{"text":"Really solid Thai food in the South Hills at last. I've been waiting for just such a place as this, and have had lunch here twice this week. My benchmark for good Thai is green curry with chicken, as it's my favorite, and their rendition delivers. A pet peeve of mine at some Thai restaurants is when the vegetables are not properly cooked...either underdone, or the cook chooses to cook all the veggies together, without considering that some veggies will cook faster than others. Here, the kitchen is paying attention to details like that, so the eggplant in this curry was meltingly tender, while the green beans, peppers and pea pods all had a satisfying crunch without being raw. The veggies were all cut into proper bite sized pieces too, so you can eat this curry with a spoon without having to saw away at anything. The chicken was perfection, and reminded me of silken chicken that you find at good Chinese restaurants; very tender and cooked through without being overdone. The green curry broth was creamy and rich with coconut milk, and my stated desired spice level (medium) was exactly as expected. 

On my return visit I opted for the red curry with chicken, and was again not disappointed. I sampled the dumplings that my husband ordered and they were good, although I could tell they had been made ahead. I'd have given them 5 stars except for that, as these dumplings ( which are shaped like traditional shu mai) had a nice rich pork flavor, but the dumpling part had dried out a little. 

Service is excellent; friendly to the point of deference and efficient. It looks like they have a full bar here, although the bottles on display were quite limited. I'll be returning here often."}
{"text":"We still really like this place but the last 2 times we have been here we have to send the crab Rangoon back because it was still cold in the middle. The staff has been very accommodating to correct the problem,  but still....
Otherwise everything is still great. A little different but great."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday my wife ordered a salad in the vinegar with so potent it made everybody at our table cry and had to be sent back absolutely terrible"}
{"text":"I quite liked this place for Arizona. Honestly I would have given it a 2.5 if possible. I just got take our for lunch from this place. 

I ordered the green curry with beef, and the eggplant dish with chicken. The green curry was different from what I'm used to. Not really in a bad way, but not in a good. I missed the veggies and bamboo shoots. The meat was good quality. It was a bit expensive for what it was so I dont know if ill return even though the place is right by my house.

I'm used to eating Thai food in California, so my standards are a bit higher than what is offered out here in Arizona. I think that Siam Thai is much better, cheaper prices, and i will make the 15-20 min drive there over this place anyday."}
{"text":"This is it. Every other Thai restaurant I go to is compared to this place, and here hasn't been one that tastes as great as this one. Every curry option is awesome and the drunken noddles are top notch. The bubble tea is also a great drink to cool off from a hot meal."}
{"text":"We eat at My Thai about twice a month.  Sometimes we do carry out and other times we eat at the restaurant.  There is usually the same couple of waitstaff there.  And we are always treated very, very well.  We usually have a lot of food modifications as well....like no sugar, completely vegetarian with no oyster sauce, fish sauce, etc, and VERY spicy.  They always accommodate us and always get it right.  While this restaurant doesn't have anything specific for kids, they have a nice attitude towards kids and are friendly.  My 4 year old likes coming here and will often ask to go to My Thai.

The only reason I don't give this restaurant a 5 star rating is because I wish they could do some local sourcing for the food and/or organic."}
{"text":"Everything I've had in this place are good.. I usually get the beef salad although I've had it somewhere else in LA and it was way better.  Everything else I've had from the pad thai and other dishes and the curry dishes are all pretty good as well.  The appetizer salad that they serve with your meals is not all that but it's good enough for the hungry stomach..  They have good lunch deals as well.  

Nice, clean place and good service."}
{"text":"I have lived in Chesterland for about 11 years. This is a nice little spot however my daughter and I really did not like the food AT ALL... almost 40.00 for lunch and we threw the food away when we got home. Now in fairness it must be the Thai thing because lots of people say good things about it. I give it three stars to support all the locals that really like it. If this were just a ME rating I would give it one star."}
{"text":"Yummy Roll is amazing! TJ the sushi chef makes the best rolls in Champaign! Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"My wife and I give it a solid \"Meh\".  She ordered Massaman Chicken and I the Stir-Fried Thai Spice.  She asked for no heat, which is pretty much what you get with Massaman anyway.  I asked for \"native Thai\", and specified that I'd like it as hot as they were willing to make it, and then some.

When the entrees arrived, we swapped forkfulls.  Both plates were the same entree; they used the exact same sauce; the only difference was that hers had no peppers and green beans.  We estimated that if hers was a \"0\" heat, mine was maybe a \"2\".

Prices were about what you'd expect.  The soup (which we didn't try) was quite a bit more expensive than what we usually pay, but the entrees were a little less, so I guess it evens out. 

The flavoring was adequate, but nothing to write home about.  I'd say it was about what you'd get if you went to a Thai restaurant in a mall food court.  Maybe that's considered good in Chesterland, but there are plenty of better Thai restaurants around Cleveland."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this nice restaurant.  Food was delicious. Recommended by a friend. We are glad we went there for lunch and will definitely return. Ordered Thai Legend Noodles and Veg Delight to go so that we can have more for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant of all time!  The food is amazing!  We eat here 3-4 times a month.  Vegan options are excellent!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Octopus appetizer was delicious. 
We got two sushi rolls....sorry I cannot remember the names. Yummy!! 
Waitress was very nice and attentive. 
I will go back!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my mom and sister- they had been here before and told me it was pretty good. We came on a Saturday afternoon and were the only ones in the restaurant. The service was great but the food wasn't very impressive. I ordered masaman curry and although it wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing either. My sisters pad Thai was pretty good but a little too peanut butter tasting. The best thing about our meal were the fried spring rolls. Although we weren't blown away, nothing was bad and therefore I would be willing to come here again, it just wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"A great restaurant, and an excellent addition to Chesterland where we have far too many sports bars. 

Try their Pan Fried Noodles - so good!"}
{"text":"Love it!

I tried My Thai for the first time just over a year ago.  Absolutely consistently delicious!  

My favorite (so far) is the Chili Fried Rice.  It comes with plenty of chicken but I like to order extra chicken and the hot spice level.  So good!

Although I do order carry out, I have enjoyed dining in when possible.  Very cute, clean place with delightful ambiance.  

Easily my favorite Thai restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My Thai is a solid restaurant.  Takeout is good, and dine-in is also good.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"We used to frequent the \"old location\" a few years ago. We stopped going there due to a change in work schedules. Never really had an opportunity to try the new location as it's a distance from our home. Today was different! My husband and I were both in the area, so we stopped in for lunch. The outside looked nice but I was hit in the face with an over-powering stench of air freshener in the lobby (what were they masking?) that followed me into the restaurant that was really cloying and gross. I don't want Glade-Plugins in my nose while I'm paying to eat. Just clean your place. Strike One. The tables were sticky. AGAIN. The old location always had sticky tables but decent food so we overlooked it in the past. I had hoped they had finally learned to clean tables. Alas, no. Apparently, they are not cleaning the floors now either. I glanced at my feet and there were piles of dust and chunks of debris literally pushed under the table feet of my table and everyone else's. Gross. I'd never noticed this at the old place. If the restaurant is now that dirty - what the heck does the kitchen look like? Strike Two. Today I almost broke a tooth on really really hard rice I mixed into in my curry. How old was that rice? I spit it out to make sure it really was rice and not something foreign  - yep rice. But it was hard like a stone. I mean - ROCK SOLID. And I had a more than a few in there. Cutting corners.... hmm. Strike Three. Oh and apparently the bathroom door doesn't lock either?! What? Food is just not as good as we remembered it. They really seem to be cutting corners now to stay afloat. As I said, we hadn't visited in many years and after this experience - we will not return."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food in ample portions. We were looking for a place to have lunch with healthy options for us and numerous vegan choices for our friend. Not easy to find in Geauga County. My Thai is it! This was our first visit but definitely far from the last. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just had the Yellow Curry Noodle Bowl with veggies and it was perfect! Lots of texture, and heat (which I requested) and loaded with veggies. Very friendly service.
Best Thai food I've had in the South Hills area."}
{"text":"The resturant was a classy little place right on the main drag in dormont. 

Staff:
It had the most friendly and helpful staff who were almost too eager to serve. In fact I didn't have my glass of water below the 3/4 full line the entire time! 

Ambience:
The place had a weird smell almost of dirty mop water, but honestly that could have been a fluke and one time thing. There was one lady fully dressed up in a traditional outfit while the rest of the servers wore black on black. 

Food:
I had the red curry tofu, which lacked a bit of spice, and was skimpy on the eggplant. The girlfriend had a basil tofu with peppers, that dish looked a lot better than my curry however I couldn't try it because she gets it way to hot.

Overall for the price I would rather go to Thai Me Up in the Southside or Thai Spoon in Dormont, but this fits nicely into the Thai Pittsburgh makeup."}
{"text":"Delicious...had the yellow chicken curry and the spicy eggplant dishes...wow! Great flavors and great service. Service was outstanding as usual and the price is always reasonable. Look forward until next time."}
{"text":"Best sushi in champaign/Urbana. The staff is always friendly. We dine in and take out 3 days a week:)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than 2 stars!  Their website listed prices for items, but when I called to get delivery, they told me their own website was wrong.  They tried to charge me an extra $25."}
{"text":"Despite living so close to this place for a couple of years, I somehow wasn't motivated to try it out until yesterday when my mom was craving Thai at 9pm.  This seemed open at that hour and we walked in. It really is a lot nicer inside than it seems from the outside. We were promptly seated and ordered their vegetarian appetizer sampler to start with the papaya salad. Both were pretty good. The eggplant crisps are definitely recommended. Their menu is full of vegetarian options and nearly all their dishes can be made vegetarian! Yay! We ordered the green curry with vegetables for our main course and the Thai-basil fried rice. Their serving sizes are quite large and we ended up taking a lot of food home. I did think that a lot of their sauces, dips and even the curry tended towards the sweeter side..tasty though. I'm not sure if that was because we emphasized \"no spicy at all\" or if that's how it is. I'm definitely going back and checking out more items on their menu. Curry fried rice for one caught my eye! Also, don't miss their lemon ginger tea. It was the most soothing end to a great hearty meal on a cold night."}
{"text":"Really good thai food given we are in ohio. The curry dishes are delicious. The chili fried rice is awesome and I love the thai spice soup. The inside of the restaurant is nothing special but what they lack in ambiance and decor they more than make up for in tasty food. We do a lot of take out from there and the orders are always correct. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My Thai has fantastic food, reasonable prices, and is certainly growing. You just need to know what to order!

Pad thai is delicious and cheap, and portions are massive. Pretty much all their sushi rolls are great (especially the more complicated/tempura fried/less traditional ones) and at some of the lowest prices in C-U. I've also enjoyed their mango curry and pineapple friend rice. Not a huge fan of their basil duck, but crispy duck is good. Tempura was just okay. Many of their appetizers are cute, but I haven't tried many.

As other reviewers have mentioned, My Thai is in a quieter part of town, so you'll pretty much always be able to find a seat. It used to be almost too empty at times, so I would always get takeout, but recently business has been flowing, there have been more waiters, and overall the dine-in ambiance has become quite nice. Sushi tastes & looks much better when it's served on a porcelain plate vs. plastic take-out box, too. :)

Overall, I definitely recommend trying this place, even if for nothing else than pad thai to-go (which I've done countless times)!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have just started eating Thai food and this was the first place we tried in the CU. We ordered the pad Thai (beef, level 3) and drunken noodles (beef, level 3). Both were excellent and the perfect level of spice for us!"}
{"text":"Ever since I tried Thai food for the first time while on vacation, I've been on a mission to find the best Thai food in the area... and My Thai is definitely the winner. I ordered the tofu Pad Thai and the spring rolls and they were both amazing! The tofu was cooked to perfection and I liked the addition of fresh cabbage on top. The spring rolls were fried perfectly with tons of flavor too. This place has me craving their food almost everyday since trying it and I cannot wait to come back here. I can't wait to explore more of the menu since they have so many delicious sounding vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the food @ My Thai. I ordered the Bean Thread Noodles with just vegetables. Food came out fast & was very delicious. My husband ordered the Fish with Chili Sauce which he said was very good. No complaints.
My only worry is will the restaurant last. I ate there on a Friday night and there were just a handful of people eating there. Not sure why it wasn't more busy. 
I sure hope they stick around! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love My Thai, I've probably been here more than any other restaurant in the Cleveland area (close to where I used to live). A list of what I've tried:

Red Curry 
Green Curry
Panang Curry
Duck Curry
Massaman Curry
Chili fried rice
Ga poa Guy 

I have never been disappointed at My Thai, and it has become a favorite of my entire family. For the less spice-driven or adventurous, there are many dishes that will suit your taste buds. My dad refuses to part with the Thai Pepper Steak at medium spice!

My only complaint is they do not use jasmine rice, but for the casual diner, who cares?"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Been ordering from here for over a year. Always get consistently great Thai food. Love their curries and pad Thai."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place and finally was able to drag my fianc√© in for a little Saturday night dinner date. 
Starting with drinks, I ordered a pineapple marg and it was delicious! They surprisingly have a nice beer selection too. We ordered the sampler with dumplings, spring rolls, and chicken satay. I really liked both the dumplings and rolls and the dipping sauces complimented them very well. 
For dinner we ordered the cashew chicken and pineapple curry with veggies. Wow. Just wow, My Thai is amazing! The pineapple curry was pretty spicy even at a level 2 and it was so good. The chicken was really good too, perfectly spicy at a level 4 and just simply delicious. We were too full for dessert but maybe next time. 
We had superb service as well! The restaurant was very clean and has a nice ambiance. I can't wait to go back and try more at My Thai!"}
{"text":"TL;DR at the bottom.

My boyfriend and I went to Siam Terrace but they didn't have sushi on Mondays, so the host suggested that we go to My Thai.

I was delighted to try this place. The reviews were stellar-- four whole stars-- and the pictures showed decent sushi.

The exterior was nice. A bit far off campus. The interior was fair. Our server was friendly, but she forgot our soup even though the restaurant was empty. 

The first thing to tip me off about the imminent disaster was the sushi menu. Nearly all of the rolls had cream cheese it it. I'm not a hard-knuckled foodie. I enjoy my rolls with cream cheese, but its omnipresence made me uneasy. I got the message that the food was designed for people who were used to eating shoddy sushi and needed to have a glop of cheese on everything they ate. I pictured a warm, Ziploc bag of mayo calling up its friends to get \"sushi\", meaning rice-coated, tempura-flaked, cheese balls. My Thai knows this and caters to that. It's their job to know their patrons. That's fine. I thought there was still a chance it could taste good.

That's the theme of this review. Chances. And how each was decimated.

Our first plate: the chef's choice nigiri appetizer.This was the only decent part of our meal. It was warm, the fish wasn't fatty, but it was a good deal.

Second plate: the Basil Duck. This was exceptionally bad. Sometimes \"bad\" is the only descriptor you have left and is the most encompassing, accurate one after an experience like this. The presentation was bad. It looked decidedly unappetizing. That's fine. I don't expect a place like this to plate, and looks aren't always an indicator of taste. This time, it was. This was the worst duck I've ever had. I kept getting fried breading, and I thought it was because I was eating the edges of the meat, but I realized that the duck was just poor. I don't know what part this was but it was like chewy duck string. I guess anything that comes from a duck is technically duck.The sauce was awful too. I couldn't believe this was real life. I've had really terrible duck once before, and this somehow usurped that title.

I told myself it was fine because the sushi was going to be great. Our sushi came out. It was astoundingly bad. We ordered the Crazy Roll and the Smoky Mountain. It was crazy bad. I had never experienced anything like it. First, the rolls looked unappetizing. They were indistinguishable, unappealing, feeble balls of rice sprinkled with roe. They came on a sushi boat, the floor of which was a uniform pool of mayo. I have no idea why they did this. It wasn't a design or a dollop but an actual layer covering the entire floor. The rolls fell apart really badly too.

They tasted awful.They were so gross that we just paid and left. I have never left a whole dish at a restaurant before. After we left, I looked through the reviews to figure out how they had gotten 4 stars, and I saw one by Adrienne K. that outlined almost exactly the same experience we had. We also tried to muster up the courage to eat the rolls because we didn't want to waste money. But it just wasn't worth it. We couldn't eat them. It was that bad. They were, as another reviewer said, yucky. I, too, would have preferred grocery store sushi. I don't have super high standards. I have only left two 1-star reviews for food places. As long as they make an effort and the food is palatable, I'll remember not to come back but am forgiving. My friends make fun of me for liking buffet sushi and convenience sushi. If someone like me thought My Thai was inedible, you know just how bad it is. 

I could write an essay on just the rolls. In short, they were basically the same roll of mayo. They were stuffed with imitation crab and a huge block of cream cheese with a dusting of smoked salmon. The salmon was appalling. I have never had anything like it. It was just meager shreds of salmon. The fish was just terrible. I don't even know what fish was in the Crazy Roll because it was mostly asparagus and all of it fell apart when you tried to eat it. \"It was turning my stomach and I couldn't eat it.\" This is exactly how I felt. I still feel sick thinking about it. Dear Adrienne, to answer your question, their Thai food is not better.

We paid about $60 dollars with tip to leave a boat of sushi behind.

TL;DR This is the worst sushi, nay, the worst food I've ever had in Chambana, nay, my life. My boyfriend was compelled to write his first Yelp review because of our experience here."}
{"text":"I love My Thai!  The only reason I did not give it a 5 out of 5 is that I think it is a bit pricy.  My Thai has a large menu with lots of options and fresh ingredients.  I love that they offer many healthy options like brown rice and light entrees.  Another thing I love about My Thai is you can control the heat.  I love spicy food so I get my stuff there hot and it is HOT.  I eat My Thai at least once a week.  The cashew chicken, sesame stir fry and pan fried noodles are my favorite.  Great for takeout as well."}
{"text":"We'd heard MyThai was good, and we went two weeks ago. My partner ordered crab rangoon - which I'm never excited about because it's bland cream cheese in a tough fried wrapper. Whoops - not HERE, it's not! The wrappers are thinner, fried *just* crisp, with a delicate sweet flavor - and yes, there is actually CRAB in their rangoons!  We had one order as an appetizer, and another as dessert!  I had the Presidential fried rice, and it had a much better flavor than your typical bland combo-fried-rice. My partner had typical pad thai with chicken - spiced the way he wanted it (mild/medium). It was tasty, seasoned well and excellent portions. (The Presidential fried rice is definitely enough for one football player or two middle-aged folks).  We've been long-time Siam Terrace customers, but whenever we're on the west side of C-U and get a hankering for Thai, we're going here. They've done a great job with the interior, too, and the service was great, even though the place was hopping."}
{"text":"We visited My Thai for the first time last night - the restaurant co-located with a bakery in a tiny strip mall on the northwest corner of the 306/Mayfield intersection.  For dishes we ordered the Chicken Satay appetizer ($6.99), Pad Thai w/ Chicken & Shrimp dinner ($10.99), and the Duck Curry dinner ($15.99).

The Chicken Satay appetizer was made from lean breast meat but ended up being overcooked and dry.  (For best flavor, choice of meat should be fattier such as like thigh meat and grilled over a hot fire hibachi-style.)  The peanut sauce was a little bland, oily and needed more flavor.

The chicken in their Pad Thai w/ Chicken & Shrimp dinner was also dry and the dish a little light on shrimp.  Duck Curry tasted good but was a bit oily and, like their Pad Thai, was more sauce than meat.  Both dishes definitely didn't have enough heat - even for my wife who is truly a featherweight when it comes to spice.  (Thankfully they had Siracha sauce at the rescue!)

No complaints on the Thai Iced Tea, Sticky Rice w/ Banana dessert, or the Tapioca Cream dessert.

For being an Asian restaurant in the middle of rustic Geauga County, Ohio, the food is about 4.5-stars for taste.  However, compared to the Thai restaurants I've been to around the country, the Pacific Rim, and Southeast Asia, it's about a 3.5 to 4 stars for taste.  My Thai just didn't have the freshness and quality in ingredients so vitally important and characteristic in Thai cuisine.  There was a \"can-ness\" about the food making it bit thick, heavy, and oily instead of light, clean, crisp, and fresh. (Yes, even curry should have a crispness and freshness.)  I can't really hold ingredient availability against the restaurant all too much as I'm sure it's not easy to get fresh bamboo shoots, baby corn, basil, coconut milk, etc. in winter in Cleveland!  But that and preparation does have an effect on my total grade.

Ambiance could use some help.  I personally didn't care for the open service area right behind our heads (separated by a curtain of rings) - it made for a noisy, unintimate evening as the waiter/waitresses bussed plates and drinks and conversed a few feet from our ears.  As a sit-down restaurant, the furniture and decor was rather lackluster - just a food serving room stuffed into an office space with old, water-stained drop ceilings and few Thai-themed decorations.

Service was a positive - they had between 2:1 and 3:1 tables-to-waiter ratio - and were very friendly and accomodating.  This is one of the best attributes about My Thai.

While we didn't have anything \"bad\" from My Thai, we also didn't have anything spectacular (5-stars) in regard to the Thai food experience.  I would have given 4 stars for the flavors and great service but minus the ingredient freshness/quality and ambiance it's a high 3-stars.

For Thai food in Cleveland's east side, I highly recommend Lemon Grass in Cleveland Heights or one of the Hunan restaurants in Solon and Chagrin Falls - all of which have terrific Thai dishes.  (The Hunan restaurants are Chinese in nature but also have Thai menus)."}
{"text":"My favorite Pittsburgh Thai place! We used to drive across the city but since finding this place a year or so ago we're happy to stick to the South Hills. First... their staff is the best! They are so friendly, from your first visit through getting to know you after becoming a regular. We even hung out 15 minutes after closing while they cleaned and counted the $ and they didn't say anything. There is a nice selection of drinks at a good price. The noodle dishes are all delicious, and most importantly their green curry is the best in the area!  Green curry with chicken, ask for extra veggies."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review from my visit here few months ago. Since I live in dormont - my go-to place for Thai Food will always be the \"Thai Spoon\" but since Thai Spoon was closed for renovation - we walked to My Thai. It's a pretty spacious place with a nice full bar in the middle  with a pretty good selection of beers and surrounded by some flat screen TVs.

I got the Duck Curry and my lady got the Pad Thai. The duck curry was okay - it seemed a little bland for my taste. However, the Pad thai was pretty good.

The price compared to Thai Spoon is bit cheaper and despite my 3 star I would still recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The owner is very committed to serving quality food and promoting local Chesterland business. They have great lunch, birthday and daily specials. It's ideal for a quiet night with your family or even a cute date. Yellow curry is excellent. I remember the spring rolls being particularly good too. Even my picky tofu-only vegetarian family members loved it."}
{"text":"my new favorite place to eat! the staff is always so welcoming"}
{"text":"The thai fried rice is my absolute favorite! I used to work in the area and frequented this place for lunch. Boy, do I miss it. 

They are pretty fast with take out orders, even when they're busy."}
{"text":"I have very limited Thai experience to go from but my lunch com-padre gave me something to go off of. 

My Thai was very friendly, clean, organized and efficient. 

I had the Pad Thai lunch special @ 7.95 it included a salad and spring roll. 

The salad was fresh and crisp with a nice light tangy dressing and crunchy noodle on top. The spring roll was small flaky and very tasty. 

The Pad Thai was very good. Chicken, shrimp, Thai sauce and peanuts. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the sauce was good, the chicken and shrimp were both good. We asked for some spicy sauce to add to it. (I suggest using this slowly at first) lol 

The service was on point, quick with refills and meals. 

They also have a full bar, for those in need of a drink."}
{"text":"we really like My Thai. the food is always super flavorful and the staff is attentive and kind. 
my favorite is this Tom Yum noodle Soup and crab Rangoon, hubby always gets Pad Thai and Tom Yum. 
one of the better Thai places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I always get the fish with chili paste when I go and it never fails! When I'm craving Asian cuisine and I'm too lazy to cook they're always first on my list. Super friendly and attentive staff as well."}
{"text":"Get over here soon! This is probably one of the top ten restaurants in Champaign/Urbana. Food quality was awesome. Service was spectacular. The best Crab Rangoons I've ever had. Ever."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my first time and was blown away! The restaurant is very cute inside, the staff is very friendly, and the food is incredible!

We got a sampler plate for an appetizer that included chicken satay skewers, spring rolls, and dumplings. All were delicious, but the dumplings were phenomenal. I would highly recommend these! For my main course, I got the pumpkin curry. I was happy to see this on the menu in the summertime because I love pumpkin and typically only see it on menus at Thai restaurants in the fall.
This curry was AMAZING! The texture of the pumpkin was wonderful-it was tender and melted in my mouth. And the sauce was incredible. It was a creamy coconut sauce with a distinct tomato finish. The spice scale was 1-5, and I chose a 4. Even at 4, it was not incredibly spicy, but added just the right amount of kick to the curry. I ate the entire portion-I could not stop eating it!

I am so glad to have found another excellent Thai place in the area, and look forward to returning very soon."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. It was very good and very reasonable in price. Portions are not huge, but for me that's a good thing. I had tofu pad thai and it was tasty. I ordered it medium spicy and it was pretty mild. Mom had two appetizers and loved them. The music playing was nice and we didn't experience any acoustic problems as Hana G. did."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of My Thai and Siem Terrace!  Their Tofu Pad Thai is delicious and they also can make it gluten free for all of those who have Celiac."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Thai, look no further! My Thai is a great option for Thai, Japanese and sushi dishes. 

We came in late on a Saturday evening (around 8pm). We were seated right away and were warmly greeted by our friendly waitress. We ordered the crab rangoon appetizer, a sushi boat for one, and red curry. 

The crab rangoon was very light and crisp! I would definitely recommend it as a starter. The sushi boat for one was very impressive - 9 pieces of nigiri, 7 sashimi, and one sushi roll. Everything was fresh and delicious. My partner said his red curry was also very tasty and was his favorite Thai dish yet. 

The serving sizes were great! We ate up all the rangoons and sushi, but my partner had a little curry leftover. It reheated very well and worked wonderfully for a next day lunch! 

We will definitely be back. Very friendly staff, great food - couldn't ask for a better experience!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Thai while in the south hills. I found a few options thanks to yelp and we ultimately decided on My Thai. 

The restaurant was nearly empty on a Tuesday night. Our server did a great job and was so kind. We ordered spring rolls as an app. For entree, I decided on the cashew and went with chicken. Bobby went with the duck curry.

Our egg rolls were very good. My cashew chicken was good, but I wouldve liked more sauce. Bobbys duck curry was amazing. He loved it.

Our server was so kind the entire time. She boxed up our leftovers. I asked for extra sauce and she mentioned they are pre-portioned. The sauce was so delicious I wouldve loved more for my rice. No big deal I just wanted to note it.

We were too full for dessert, but our server told us what was offered. They had a few options which I cant remember, but more importantly they offer fried ice cream! 

Great, authentic thai with excellent service. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I loved the food at the My Thai restaurant. The presentation of the food was very nice. I've eaten Thai food all around the country and this is in the top 5! We ordered a large selection of food and it was all great!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick take out of yellow curry, house noodles, and basil chicken, and crab puffs.  Not bad, maybe not as good as everyone else seems to think it is.  

The yellow curry was pretty decent, but I've definately had better.  The basil chicken was spot on.  I really enjoyed it.  The house noodles were also quite tasty as well.. My favorite was the crab puffs.  Probably the best I've had in the 2 years here in the valley.  

The prices are about what you would expect to pay.. Right around 38 bucks for the meal.  

The service was just as good as anyone else mentioned.  I was quickly waited on, given suggestions, and sent on my way with a smile.

I'll go back if I'm wanting some thai and in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and prices. Love this place especially because they are very helpful if you are a vegetarian or vegan. The pineapple rice is a favorite along with the Pad Tai. The veggie
Spring rolls are alway hot and never greasy which has been a issue in other Thai Restaurants. close to home is a bonus for us."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Things were clean. Food was delicious and in large proportions. 

I will certainly return for sushi. Sakanaya costs way too much. What I would spend for 2 people on sushi there I can feed 4 people here. The photos are real.

It is worth the drive if you are a college student and it's not too heavy on the wallet. Great for a date!

I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. My food was adequate, service was pretty decent but nothing about it really blew me away. I don't think I'd eat here again with Satara right down the road though."}
{"text":"Based on the location and exterior, I was shocked how good the food and service was at this restaurant.  I encourage anyone that enjoys Thai food to give place a chance.  I eat a ton of Thai food, and this is definitely one of the best!  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Takeout 

We really wanted to like this place because of all the great reviews however, the dishes we tried lacked flavor and spice. 

Padthai: This is always a hit or miss, in this case there was no flavor. It tasted like your typical fried noodles with soy sauce. It didn't have spice or a punch of flavor :( cost $10

Papaya salad: Not good. We only tasted watered down fish sauce and maybe a squeeze of lime. Really missing the spicy Thai sweet and sour flavors in this dish. Cost $8

Beef Panang curry: This dish was not terrible, probably the best out of the three. We asked for it to be made very spicy and it wasn't even close. Cost $10-11

Overall, we will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to the ethnic choices in West Champaign.  The proprietor is the same guy that has done so well with Siam Terrace in downtown Urbana.  He's still running ST but his wife has been working in My Thai since it opened in early August, 2010.  It's different than Siam Terrace, but serves all the same great sushi and has a sushi bar.  This location used to be an El Toro, then the Fuentes family converted El Toro to Illini Grill and Pancakes and now it has become My Thai."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood. My boyfriend and I have been several times since they opened. The massaman curry is my fav!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem tucked away in Dormont. The pad see ewe is my favorite I've found in the Pittsburgh area so far (I'm a Chicago transplant) The staff is super friendly, establishment is dated a bit but very clean, and the made fresh Thai is worth every penny !"}
{"text":"The Tom Yum vegetable soup was full of vegetables and very flavorful. The green curry chicken was the best I've had in the Pittsburgh area. Service was great and the ambience was quiet and calming. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The restaurant decor was just okay.  The ladies restroom could use a little cleaning. We shared the chicken spring rolls & steamed shrimp dumplings.  Both were very good.  I had the chicken/shrimp pad Thai and it was good.  My friend ordered the jungle curry.  She liked it but said she had better thai food.  Overall good food.  I would give it a try again."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite thai place.  Time will tell, but it certainly gives Thai Cusine and/or Thai Spoon a run for its money.  Today, I had the pumpkin curry, spiciness level 1 (beware! The scale is 1-5 not 1-10, like most places!) and it was VERY good.  Just enough spice to catch my attention, and I could tell the pumpkin was fresh.  It was slightly al dente (can you describe squashes with this word?), maybe a tad bit too hard for my liking, but it was great.  I'd rather have too hard fresh pumpkin than pumpkin from a can.  The price for lunch - $7.95 - can't be beat!  Perfect portion sizes, and very attentive and friendly staff.  I'm excited to go back and try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Cute place right on Rt 19 in Dormont. This place was very clean inside, with a lot of tables, and a nice size full bar. I don't get to eat Thai a lot, so I don't really know what its all about. I'm into trying new things, but I never know where to start with Thai food. I told the waitress about my dilemma- she was so kind and helpful and really explained the menu. She was very knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu! I love spicy food, so I decided to try the Panang Curry (one of her suggestions) with vegetables. I really liked it! The sauce was creamy and packed with flavor. My friend got the green curry, and that however, I did not like. My Thai was pretty great- I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that this place is located where it is - in the shell of Cips!  The interior renovation makes it look amazing.  Bravo My Thai on making the place nice!

PROS
- more classy than casual atmosphere. Seems to help justify that it's a little on the more expensive side. 
- high-quality service. Constant water refills are a good thing.  
- the hostesses, in traditional Thai garb, danced a traditional Thai dance every half hour. Really impressive and unique. 

CONS
- no kid menu options. They literally have no menu items to accommodate the typical limited palate of a kid under 10.  Even suggesting making buttered noodles (no butter) couldn't happen. This will really limit the # of visits we make. (But maybe they don't want kids as a part of their clientele...)"}
{"text":"A nice, bright, new interior. Quiet and pleasant. Food came out quick. Generous portions. Lots of options. A menu for any type of diet. Price was reasonable for two. Would return as a customer again."}
{"text":"This establishment is ideal for authentic Thai food. There has not been a time that I have been let down My Thai. I order the Pineapple curry with chicken and Tom yum soup every time. Anyone I have come with has been fully satisfied by their meal."}
{"text":"i'm honestly not quite sure what to think of this place.  i'm not a thai food connoisseur, but something still seemed a bit off.  don't get me wrong, the food is DELICIOUS.  this would probably be a good spot to take someone if they like asian food but are a little shy about trying  thai food.  i ordered the pad thai.  it was cooked perfectly (not too much not too little) and the flavor was delightful, but it wasn't spicy at all.  i had assumed by the chili pepper next to it that it would have some kick to it. i could have and probably should have asked for some spice.  the pepper beef is FANTASTIC!  peppers and onions are cooked just right and the beef is melt-in-your-mouth tender.   
the service was perfect and the food was good, but i think next time i want thai food, i'll hit up someplace a bit more authentic."}
{"text":"My Thai is very intimate and the staff is extremely helpful. This place got me hooked on curry two years ago at its opening! Beautiful presentation and great selection of appetizers and entrees.
Only negative is the acoustics, it was very quiet and I felt like the parties seated next to me could hear my every word! Check out MyFoxCleveland reviews, they are right on!"}
{"text":"Food is disgusting. Everything tastes like it has freezer burn. Even the tofu!"}
{"text":"Mediocre pad Thai. The tofu was dried out and spongy. That's all I tried-might consider going back to try something else."}
{"text":"Honestly, I probably get takeout from here at least once a week, and that's at least. I have only gotten pickup from this restaurant but when I do my food is always ready when I arrived at the time that I am given or sometimes I am even a few minutes early and it is ready. The staff is super friendly. Even though I don't interact with them much other than them handing me  my food, I can tell that they recognize me and that is a good feeling.
 My favorite thing to order on the menu is the green curry with tofu. I get it at level 2 spice and that is perfectly hot enough for me. Just enough to clear your sinuses somewhat but not too much that you need to stop and take a drink after every bite. The tofu is absolutely delicious in my opinion. It seems to be lightly fried and it takes in all of the flavor of the green curry sauce. There are also plenty of vegetables in the curry sauce that are cooked yet still crisp and they go great in the dish. I still have yet to try the sushi here but I really want to and have high hopes."}
{"text":"The staff here is excellent and really welcoming. Sit in the window, order a cocktail (full, nice bar) and have some delish Thai food.  The soups are all excellent, the curries delicious, as are the noodles. Stop in when they have the dancers performing - so lovely. Unless you love spice I wouldn't go above a \"2\" on the spice scale."}
{"text":"Very nice place and excellent food. Good service and clean and simple layout. Truly enjoyed the dinner. A 2 on the 1-5 scale was enough spice for my taste but I am a wimp . Regret we do not live on this side of town."}
{"text":"Great Food and Service !   we tried Pad Thai, Panang (sp?) Curry and Spring Rolls.

We just had our second visit to this fairly new restaurant and plan to go back again.  

Parking:  was a bit of a challenge but well worth the effort. 
Inside Location:  Nicely decorated; Clean well-kept Bathroom. 
Service:  Friendly, professional and consistent for our two visits.
Recommend:  for dinning alone or with a date; dress can be casual or dressy
Price:  great value for the money.  

I love the food and plan to go back again."}
{"text":"Sushi is alright, however, it does not justify the price. I've had more authentic and fresh quality sushi for the price they're selling their \"alright\"sushi for. It's not consistent. I've ordered the same roll multiple times and they have changed the recipe/ingredients every time. They also \"dress up\" their sushi way too much. They add all these random flowers and vegetable decorations that just try to make the sushi look more enticing than it really is. 

The atmosphere sucks. The waitresses hover and stand in the corner of the restaurant eyeing you as you eat your meal, eagerly waiting for you to pay. Nothing special about the exterior or interior of the restaurant. If you're looking to come here for a fun date, I suggest ordering to-go instead. No ambiance."}
{"text":"I don't know why the average review isn't higher, this food was great! We got delivery, so I can't rate the ambience or service, but delivery was quick, polite, and followed directions for once. You know what? You're in rural Illinois: stop ordering sushi. This place is called My Thai, so get the Thai food."}
{"text":"In no way am I a Thai food guru, but I do have my favorite Thai places. My Thai might have just knocked Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield off is throne. 

I'm a fan of spicy, but man, their spicy scale is waaay in the favor of hot. So, if you don't like your food hot, go with 1. Two was perfect in my scale. I had Pineapple Chicken Curry, and it was just right. I think the pineapples helped me cool down between the hotter bites. My fabulous date had Pad Thai, and he had zero complaints. But then again, it was food, and the day of the week ended in Y, so he wouldn't complain about anything, haha! 

The service was spot on, we walked in and immediately were sat. The server was quickly with us and brought water. The food arrived before we knew it, and we were enjoying our amazing dinner. 
I would love to go back again, and try something different! 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"This might be one of my new favorite restaurants (east of cleveland)! 

 This past weekend I went on a sort of Thai food bender.  Saturday take out from Ty Fun in Tremont (pretty much a weekly staple in my life) and for dinner Sunday first time having MyThai.  I placed a take out order 5 entree's 2 apps.  The girl taking the order was awesome, completely helpful even with all the pain in the ass dietary restrictions.  They offer both white & brown rice, as well as my favorite option \"how spicy?\"  She said it would be ready in 15 minutes, and it was.   

Everyone enjoyed their entree.  But for the sake of this review I will only speak from my experience.  I ordered the Mango Curry w/ Tofu, Thai Hot, the hottest they do and they nailed it! (I have a serious addiction to spicy food-- like bottle of sriracha in my desk drawer at work addicted, and a lot of places chicken out when it comes to adding heat) 

It was so good, the warm curry, the heat from the chili pepper, the sweetness of coconut milk & mango.  

My husband got the Red Curry w/ tofu, Thai Hot also.  His was equally as good.  


Take out serving size was HUGE, ours came in 32oz cartons.  (Leftovers for DAYS) the others were meat eater versions and they came in deep styrofoam take out boxes. 

I can't wait to try some of the other options on their menu!  



**If you find yourself on the west side and are looking for Thai food there is a place in Avon called Thai Chili, it's equally as good."}
{"text":"When you don't see Asians in an Asian restaurant, you should get a clue.  This is an Americanized Thai restaurant; just like any other Americanized Asian restaurants, food was very salty.  My dish was super salty, the sauce only tastes salty without any other savory flavor; brown rice was under cooked.  Will not come back anymore."}
{"text":"Their pineapple fried rice and The My Thai salad are the best ever! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I got a specialty roll that was tasty. The portion size of the roll was what you would expect a roll to be.  

But the specialty sauce that usually should be on top of a roll was spread on the bottom of the box which seeped into the crevasses of the container. 

Whatever the reason, I gave it a three because the food was not worth the price I paid. Maybe my experience would have been better if I dined in which would have excluded some of the extra charges."}
{"text":"I was just here last night. I ordered sticky rice and pad thai for my main course. Everything was perfectly cooked to the measure. Only drawback is i wish the pad thai had slightly more sauce on it but otherwise i thought it was perfect. Will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Greetings fellow Yelpers!! This is my first submission of a review. I have used Yelp for several years now to find, check in at, and leave tips for, some wonderful establishments. However my life has changed. I am dating a Yelp Elite now!! She has shared with me that if I ever wish to join her ranks then I must review. Challenge accepted!!  I chose to kick things off with My Thai for two reasons. One, I've only been there twice, and both occasions were with the Elite one. And two, on each of my visits I was blown away by not only the cood, but the calibre of service as well! I have two Thai dishes, Chicken Pad Thai and Green Curry Chicken,  that are first to be checked off at any restaurant before I start bee bopping around on the menu. My first visit which was about six months ago found me up against the Pad Thai. It was not my favorite offering ever, that title still goes to Green Mango,  however it was much closer than I expected it to be. Unfortunately remembering that it was really good is about as much as I can share. It was half a year ago, and we eat out A LOT!!  We found ourselves back this past Friday and it was time to give their Green Curry a go. Let me start by saying they have a 1-5 heat scale which is a little new for me. I usually enjoy a 4 to 5 on a scale of 10, and was going to order a 3.  Boy am I glad that my lovely date talked me into getting a 2!! The heat was not overwhelming, but I fear it would have been at the next level. Everything about the meal was absolutely perfect! The first thing I noticed were the amazing colors. The broccoli, and green peppers were very vibrant and nicely complimented by the brownish purple tones of the bamboo shoots. And everything was pulled together by the bright white hue of the excellently prepared chicken! I will happily ecclaim that this was in fact the best Green Curry that I have been served, and I will return to enjoy it again! While the food is certainly the star of the show at My Thai their wonderful staff do everything they can to steal some of the spotlight. They are extremely friendly as well as attentive, plus they don't hesitate to give you a very informative input regarding your dish of choice. This visit as well as the dish deseves a 5+ stars rating! Overall My Thai is a solid 4 stars and we will not hesitate to return the next time we are in need of some Thai goodness!! I hope you find this review helpful!! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai food. I've passed by My Thai many times. I've looked at the menu online before & thought it seemed a little over priced. I finally thought it might be worth it. Especially since this is a place that specializes in Thai food. I mean, it's in the name. I placed a pick-up order. When I got there (between 6/6:30pm) the place was empty, besides one guy closing his tab at the bar.

First I ordered Satay Chicken, which is one of my favorite appetizers, next to Crab Rangoon. This was the worst Satay I've ever had. The chicken was marinated & cooked in a curry sauce, but it tasted rubbery. Satay is supposed to be accompanied with a curry peanut sauce, which when done right is magnificent. This sauce was globular. It looked disgusting. I mixed it around & tasted a bit. It was gross. They also served it with a Cucumber sauce, which looked liked diced cucumbers in a green watery sauce (pickled?). I didn't taste it. I just ate the chicken plain & was very disappointed.

Secondly, I ordered Panang Curry. The one thing they did that I liked was asked me, on a scale from 1-5, how hot would I like it. I have an above moderate threshold for heat, so I said 3. It was a good call. It got my attention but wasn't too much. This dish was not bad. Really good curry sauce. The vegetables tasted a little old though.

Overall, I don't think I would go back to this place again. The parking is very limited. They had my bag of food sitting on the bar, near the front door, instead of in the back, where it can stay warmer. They also gave me cocktail napkins. Cocktail napkins!!!!??? I feel embarrassed for them, when a traditional Chinese restaurant is more efficient at cooking & presenting Thai food than My Thai."}
{"text":"My Thai is a hidden gem. Although the outside and the inside may seem a bit kitschy, the food is amazing. 

There is a lot of seating in the restaurant (a bar, and sit down seats). The waitresses who work there are super nice, and the place consistently serves food quickly. It never seems too busy, so the servers are very attentive.

The pricing isn't too bad either--I would definitely recommend the pad Thai, the red curry, and the My Thai sampler. The pad Thai is some of the best in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Three times Ive tried the Shrimp Tempura Dinner. Three times I woke up in the middle of the night with food poisoning. I thought maybe it was the flu last time, but no... I'm POSITIVE its the food at MY THAI. I will be calling to let others know.. it's not cool. I want my $25 back as well as the hours of sleep lost because I had to throw up so dang much..."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here and I was pleasantly surprised. The crab rangoon was great, though a tad less hot than I'd hope, but it was delivery. I also got the Panang Special with salmon. It was great flavorful and delicious salmon! I also ordered the green tea ice cream which I haven't eaten yet, but I am looking forward to it. My Thai will be on my list to try out for sushi next."}
{"text":"On our way to a friend's party the week before Christmas, we stopped in for a quick dinner. I had heard the vegan menu was killer, and that was totally true! (see photo). I was thrilled with all of the choices, and even more delighted with the food flavor itself. The service was perfect, the ambiance was great, and we loved every single bite of the food. I had the vegan fried rice, and my husband had pad thai. The heat was as described, and we could not have been happier!  We will definitely return so we can try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Looking to knock off another bookmark for the Yelp community I went here for lunch at about 130 today. I was meeting a girl and she was nice enough to reserve the WHOLE restaurant for her and I! I found out the night before I was going here that this place was associated with Siam Terrace (which I have had before and reviewed the same exact star rating). There was no one...NO ONE...else in the restaurant

I was in time for the lunch special. I knew that I would be getting Pad Thai, but the meat and appetizer were TBD! I asked the girl I was meeting to get the summer rolls (she obliged even though I ate three she only ate one :-) and since we were getting the lunch special we also got miso soup (me) and a salad (her). What an idiot I was for ordering miso soup on a 93 degree day. It's a good thing I wasn't in a soup mood (nor should I have been) because there was barely anything in the cup!

I think there was two basil leaves and two tofu cubes. That was horrendous. 

As Justin Timberlake said, \"This just can't be summer rolls...you'll see\". He didn't say that, but the summer rolls were fresh with lettuce, carrots, tofu, and cucumber. Saved by the Bell? No, saved by the cucumber.

Anyways, our dishes arrived about seven minutes and thirty three seconds after we ordered. I guess it's not too difficult to cook up rice noodles, pork, bean sprouts, some other vegetables, and stir fry chicken with broccoli. Especially when the restaurant is empty...so that was awesome.

To review:
Salad with ginger (her...didn't look great)
Miso soup (more like Miso SUCK)...God punishing me for ordering soup when it was hotter than Bill and Monica were in the White House together...hi-yooooo!
Pad Thai Pork 
Stir Fried Broccoli

I had to ask for the following: a straw, chopsticks, a water refill, and an extra napkin since I am savage eater. The waitress checked on us a few times, but it was obvious there was a telenovela on it the back or something. 

I had high standards coming to this place. I figured, \"oh, there must be other good Asian places in Champaign-Urbana, with the large student Asian population. Siam Terrace and this place are owned by the same people, similar prices, similar menu, and similar \"A-OK\" rating.

My Thai?
It left me saying \"my bad\"."}
{"text":"I've never ordered something from this restaurant that I didn't like. I particularly like the thai fried rice, and their sushi is great too! I brought my parents here when they came to visit, and they loved it. The plates are presented beautifully, great value for the cost."}
{"text":"This place is great! Everything we had was delicious. The staff was very nice and very friendly, even with our children. Definitely our new favorite thai place in PGH."}
{"text":"Okay so it took awhile, but I finally had something from My Thai that I wasn't crazy about.... The Tom Yum soup. It was just... Super greasy. The veggies weren't very well cooked. As for the broth, it seemed just not as flavorful as it could have been or for what I have tried in the past at other place. Oh well! Lesson learned and noted: stick to the rice and noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, well prepared and I LOVE that they celebrate thai culture w dancing Thursday's and Sunday's."}
{"text":"The only good thing was the ambience. The food was not that great. I have been to other Thai restaurants and this was not upto the mark"}
{"text":"I love My Thai! I've always had a good experience when I come. I love the food and the servers are extra polite. My favorite Thai dish is always red curry and theirs doesn't disappoint! Heat level on dishes is 1-5. I like spicy and 4 is perfect. I've never tried 5 but I don't think it would be unbearable. All of the appetizers are also good, especially the crab Rangoon, my fave app! They have a nice drink selection as well but I always get the coconut mojito. A must if you like mojitos. If you come during certain times, they also have dancing performances in the dining area. The dining area isn't too big and while it does get busy, I've never had to wait for a table. Prices are moderate. Approx $60 for my husband and I for 2 entrees, drinks, appetizer and dessert. If you're up for something new for dessert, go for he sticky rice with mango! I get it every time even when I'm already full!"}
{"text":"I make it a point to eat here atleast once a week.  The Tom Yum soup is the best I have had in all of greater pittsburgh. This place is a must stop. I have tried every curry on the menu. There is not one dish I do not like here."}
{"text":"Saturday night my boyfriend and I decided to give My Thai a second try. The first trip gave us a few mixed signals, but the food was worth it to risk returning. Well, it totally paid off. 

We were promptly seated and left alone while we tried to decide what we wanted. When trying to make up our minds, we got a recommendation for plum sake from (who I believe was) the manager who was also very helpful in answering a tricky question. When we stopped in last time, my boyfriend was eyeing the food that was brought to the table next to us, and upon explaining it to the manager he directed us to the exact item on the menu. This made my boyfriend reaaallly excited. 

We like to indulge in sushi on occasion and thought we'd give it a shot here. We ordered a simple eel roll for an appetizer that was ok. It was little saucy and Americanized, but not bad. Definitely not spoiled or rancid. I'm not sure if I'd order it again though...

For dinner I ordered the prig king (chicken and green beans in a spicy sauce) but asked if they could add some broccoli and carrots to the stir fry. To my delight the dish came our loaded with the veggies I requested and then some! I love my vegetables so this was a bonus for me. My boyfriend of course ordered the Siamese chicken (the mystery no-name dish from our first experience) in complete confidence of the managers knowledge. It came out exactly as he expected: piled high with battered chicken surrounded by broccoli and carrots. 

The food was quick, hot, and delicious. The service was attentive, super helpful, but not overbearing. After being consistently disappointed in the service at Siam Terrace for about a year now, I think My Thai has become their replacement. I'm really glad we gave it a second chance."}
{"text":"We get their pad thai for family dinner pretty much one a week.  Good prices, generous servings (2 orders feeds our fam of 4).  Everything I've ever tried here is been delicious"}
{"text":"Service good but food bad wait too long for my food.
I ordered fish dish oh well it was smell like and old fish cooked in the old fry oil ,I would never order the fish dish again:("}
{"text":"My son took me to lunch here for Valentine's Day. It was snowing outside and we were ready to warm up. Unfortunately is was just as cold inside as it was outside. I took my coat off but draped it Over my legs. 
We ordered everything at once including Crab Rangoon, Tom Yum soup and Thai Noodle soup.   
The shell to the Crab Rangoon were very light and crispy but the filling was overly salty. Even the sweetness if the sauce served with it didn't cut the salt. The Thai Noodle soup (with chicken) had NO flavor. I added the hot sauce they brought to the table if we wanted to add heat but it did nothing to ramp up the flavor. The Tom Yum soup (with beef) had a better flavor so I put some of that broth into the Thai Noodle to give it flavor. 
I was very disappointed. I'm not sure if I will give them a second try or not. The one GOOD thing was the service."}
{"text":"It's not too bad, but there are MUCH better thai restaurants in town for the same price or even slightly cheaper. I was frustrated to get the wrong order after confirming twice what i wanted. The saving grace was that the Crab Rangoon was excellent. All in all, if you want thai go to prospect, if you're over in this area and can't wait 10 minutes, My Thai is fine."}
{"text":"Uhm, delicious!

I wasn't sure if getting Thai to-go for my family (who's never tried it until now) would be a good idea, especially with someone having an onion allergy... But the woman who took our order was exceptionally polite about it. No grunts or sighs! And the best part, they kept their word - not a single onion.

Raad Na 4/5
Drunken Noodles 5/5 (loved the 2 types of cabbage with it)
Green Curry 4/5
Mango Curry 5/5 (the heat was perfect)"}
{"text":"My Thai is one of those unexpected pleasures that surprises you from time to time. The building on west Springfield doesn't give any clues to the goodness inside. The restaurant is modestly sized and includes a sushi bar that actually is pretty good for being in a non-Japanese venue.

The Thai menu is very comprehensive with all of the favorite curries and pad Thai choices you might expect. The green curry is quite good and I have been able to get the spice level adjusted to my taste. I've also enjoyed the tuna poke from the sushi bar here. Sushi has to be absolutely fresh and My Thai does it right. It's wonderful to have non-Thai choices. I would say that the food is not exceptional but well-done, and the friendly service just puts the cherry atop the sundae. I have not tried any other Thai restaurants in C-U but I think this place would hold its own in comparisons with most other joints in this category. I think it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Little bit far from where I live but still gave it a try. 
Had the zombie rolls, curry, and pad thai. Really like their dessert and the thai ice tea. 
Quiet and good environment with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Having read lots of good reviews, I decided to try My Thai for myself one Saturday night recently.  I have always been a big fan of Thara Thai, but thought I should broaden my Thai food horizons a little.

First, I have to say, the crab rangoon definitely lives up to the great reviews here!  It's a refreshing change from the usual commercial fare.  I personally would have liked it to be cooked just a tiny bit longer, but it was still the best I've had in a long while.

I ordered the Tom Kha Gai soup, but it was a far cry from what I usually have for this soup. The soup was very bitter, and almost inedible (for me, anyway). The broth had very little flavor, and I couldn't get past the overpowering bitterness.  Perhaps it just had more of something than I was used to having. It was definitely a disappointment though.

My entree was Pad See Ew (chicken), ordered to be spiced as a 2 on their 1-4 scale.  I definitely should have gone higher.  I thought it was a bit bland, but overall a very average dish.  I felt the portion size for the money was pretty good, in comparison to other establishments around.

I will give them a few more chances.  Bonus star for delivering to west Champaign, which is a bigger oddity than you would think.  They have a diverse menu, so I'm sure I will find opportunity to try more items.  The president's fried rice has received good reviews here, so that might be my next adventure at My Thai. :)"}
{"text":"Everything was great there. I had pumpkin curry. I'm glad we found a great thai place eat"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful. Had fresh spring rolls & Thai samosas for apps and chicken dishes for dinner. They don't make it as spicy as other Thai places, but you could get extra hot sauce on the side. I asked for 3/5 which was supposed to be hot. To me it wasn't spicy at all. My husband got 5/5 which I usually cannot palate, but that was what my spice level preference usually is. No pics of food, we ate it all too fast!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food!!! I always order the masaman curry, and every time, it's delicious. Clean and modern atmosphere. Food is flavorful and not too spicy (unless you want it to be)!"}
{"text":"I have been hear twice. And I love the food here. Their Green and Red Curry is great. Also the soups are really good. The service is fast. Best Thai Food in town."}
{"text":"Never had one thing bad from here. Small place has a homey feel and servers are very pleasant. I really like how you can add spice to any dish. I recommend the sweet and sour stir fry and the Thai spice. If you like it spicy don't be afraid to add spice because the flavors aren't extreme, but they are delightfully strong. Great use of coconut and curry in quite a few dishes. Also try the pad thai for an entry level taste to the Thai flavors."}
{"text":"I never had Thai food before I came here so I don't have a baseline for comparison. However, I got the Pad Thai and enjoyed it. The restaurant was clean but a little cramped, in an endearing way. The service was excellent, the waiter was friendly and attentive and I got my food less than 5 minutes after ordering. I will probably eat here again.

Will update with future experiences."}
{"text":"This is NOT \"Authentic Thai Cuisine\". One of the worst Pad Thai dishes I have ever tried (First it was served with lemon not lime).  The bubble tea was not what I expected (Warm but cooled down with ice). 

     This was a disappointment.  As someone who has been to Thailand multiple times, has eaten there along with several Thai restaurants around Ohio this was most definitely NOT authentic.  I would say this Thai restaurant has become Americanized. In fact, I did not see any Orientals working or eating here.  Before I talk more on the food I will start at the beginning.
     This place looked promising as it was located in a beautiful and rural area (My roommate and I passed 4 garden/plant nursery's around this location). The restaurant itself was completely inviting and lively.  We sat at the corner booth by the windows.  As soon as we saw on the menus that bubble tea was option we ordered that.  We ordered spring rolls with the teas and water.  For our main course we both ordered the Pad Thai.  Mine was supposed to be on the \"medium\" spicy scale they advertised on the menu and my roommate wanted hot and spicy.  
     When the bubble teas arrived I was immediately concerned.  I touched the glass towards the bottom and it was hot.  On top of that I could still see powder from the \"mix\" they used so I had to keep stirring it.  It tasted like Kool-Aid with tapioca seeds and it just kept losing taste as I drank it because the hot tapioca seeds and heat were melting the ice quickly.  The spring rolls never arrived before our Pad Thai dishes.  We asked about them before we ate our main dishes and we found out that no one placed the order in the kitchen.  We didn't let this bother us entirely because they fixed the issue and we went back our main dishes.  Right away we noticed our Pad Thai had something different from all other dishes we have eaten.  This establishment serves Pad Thai with a LEMON and not a LIME.  I always understood that Pad Thai was served with lime as this was strange because lemons cost almost twice as much as limes.  Still, we tried it with lemon.  It was different but not entirely unpleasant like this. What disappointed us were the fact that both our dishes were nothing that resembled spicy.  Along with this \"missing\" factor they make their dishes of Pad Thai with a shredded handful of both cabbage and red onion.  After all of this we eventually received our spring rolls and turned out to be more like large egg rolls and tasted like they were missing something. Everything was different from all other Pad Thai dishes we have tried and turned out to be something new but disappointing.  
     Overall, this was a disappointment in an otherwise great location.  I am giving this restaurant two stars because the servers went out of their ways to help customers and keep them happy with compliments and small conversations.  They are servers who do deserve the 15-20% gratuity.  Still none of this made up for our food.  I don't think I'll be returning here."}
{"text":"Great Tai Food and desserts. Pumpkin curry was delicious and so was the papaya salad. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would eat every meal at My Thai if I could.  It's excellent and healthy food that never misses.   We are so fortunate to have this restaurant close to home in Chesterland.  If you haven't tried it yet please do yourself a favor.  

We generally do takeout, but eat in from time to time and have enjoyed every dish we have ordered."}
{"text":"I love My Thai--if I'm in the mood to go out for dinner, there's a good chance I'll be going here.

Crab Rangoon: really yummy (coming from a person who hates crab rangoon, but I had to try it after reading the rave reviews--they're right!)
Pad thai: love it!  This is my favorite and what I usually order.  I get it either with chicken or tofu.  I love the way they fry the tofu so I usually go with that.  I order it a little extra spicy since the regular pad thai doesn't have any kick to it at all.
Sushi: I've tried quite a few different rolls and they're all good.  The seafood tastes fresh...I don't think you can go wrong.
Thai iced tea/coffee: perfectly prepared and delicious!

It never seems to be very busy here so the waitstaff are all super attentive...sometimes a little too attentive.  One time I had 4 different people check in with me and ask if the food was ok.  That's a bit much (and yes, the food was great).  I can't think of any negative experience I've had here (the overzealous staff just kind of made me laugh).  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I tried their mango curry and it was alright. This place is located in a more quiescent part of town so it's great for calm lunches or dinner."}
{"text":"I am celiac and ordered gluten free Pad Thai one night that I was really craving it. They delivered, but for an added fee. Ok. When it got here, I couldn't eat it without gagging and the chicken was chewy. When I called to say tell them I couldn't eat my dinner, I was very polite and said I liked the appetizers but something was wrong with the main order. The woman on the phone didn't care and left me picking at food that activated my gag reflex. I couldn't trick myself into liking it and had to throw it out. I didn't have any food in the fridge and ended up having cereal for dinner. Later that night a manager called back and said it tasted fishy because they use fish sauce to make it gluten free. Ok? Well, way too much if it doesn't even resemble what Pad Thai tastes like. Plus I hate fish sauce. I have never encountered this before and I've been celiac for 5+ years. They did nothing to fix it and my night and hopes for delicious delivered pad thai was a bust, and my money thrown in the trash. I should have drove across town to Siam Terrace.. who have the best gluten free Pad Thai I've ever had in my life! I will not be giving this place another try. Left a bad taste in my mouth, literally and otherwise."}
{"text":"So slow this time. The service is very bad. Sushi turned out to be not in service even in weekdays."}
{"text":"My Thai does serve a distinct Thai taste.
Food is nicely flavored, but it's a bit pricier than other Thai places with similar quality. We also ordered the special \"Chef's Surprise\" sushi roll, expecting something amazing and eclectic-- ended up to be a very safe, bland roll with some tuna on top. 
It's definitely not a place I'd go out of my way for, but it's a nice place to visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"It's always encouraging to see an ill-reputed sports bar such as the not-missed Cip's give way to an affordable ethnic restaurant like the whimsically-named My Thai. Since it happened to just recently open near my birthday, I decided that My Thai would provide my takeout celebration meal, and it did with a round of fireworks. 

The interiors are simply yet elegantly appointed. No traces of the location's past were visible. One could trick a friend into thinking that My Thai has been an institution in the community of Dormont for years based on the comforting atmosphere, agile service, and quality Asian fare. 

Headed by Chef Suwannanan, My Thai's kitchen puts out a 60-dish phalanx of appetizers, soups, salad, and entrees that include pork, beef, and seafood items along with vegetarian platters. As is par for the course with these occasions, we ordered a banquet's worth of food and partook in our chosen delicacies. 

A tanned Crispy Spring Roll started each one of us off with a crunch that was complimented by the almost cloying plum sauce. I chose shrimp to (amply) fill these savory cannoli from the Far East and was pleased to know that they were neither undercooked nor overdone and were deftly seasoned. A snack ideal for a summer afternoon on a Strip District corner, these quasi-eggrolls teased our snarling stomachs, igniting our appetites for what was to come. 

Moist, corpulent stopples of pork and shrimp, the Steamed Dumplings were accompanied by a sweet and sour ginger sauce that was barely touched due to every single dough-wrapped nugget's wad of juicy, brackish umai. 

The Shrimp Pad Thai demonstrated the house's knack for cooking seafood well, its flat noodles and egg debris adding richness while its green onion, bean sprouts and ground peanuts conveyed a mix of texture, earthiness, and heat. For many this is a staple. For me it could become a habit-forming treat.

The Duck Curry was another master class in exotic cuisine. Lumps of supple, succulent, roasted, pulled-apart water fowl bobbed about a stew of warm coconut milk and curry paste with carrot, peas, pineapple, tomatoes and basil. The sweetness of the root vegetable and tangy fruits complimented the creamy auburn sauce while the seeds and herb plucked chords of nuttiness and pungency. 

A cornucopia of oceanic delights were central to the Seafood with Basil. Generous chunks of stir-fried tilapia, shrimp (it was Day of the Decapods in our house), scallop, scallion, and bell pepper were awash in a palate-enlivening garlic sauce along with udon-ish noodles. A feast in itself, the aromatic basil permeated the dish without overwhelming the natural tastes of the proteins. 

With the equally enticing Thai Cuisine just blocks away, one can no longer consider Pittsburgh's South Hills to be devoid of culinary adventure, My Thai offering a pleasingly gastronomic glimpse into a part of the world that inches closer to Middle America each day. 

P.S. For my father's sake, we played it safe in regards to the spiciness scale."}
{"text":"I decided to get my food delivered. I realize it's not Jimmy Johns so it wasn't going to be freaky fast. However, it took forever and the delivery person kept calling for directions. I only live 2 miles away and just off a main road. By the time I got my food it was hardly warm. The food wasn't even that great."}
{"text":"Nice and clean restaurant. The wait staff was very friendly! They had an American type menu for my 3 year old and the kids chicken nuggets were dinosaur shaped and pretty darn good.. My dad and I got the pad thai.. it was Mediocre. It wasn't he most flavorful I have had.. we took a meal home for my mom and she did not like it. she said it made her heart race (possibly from the amount of MSG used)"}
{"text":"Updating from a visit years ago, glad I tried again as I enjoyed my pad thai. Seemed to be a lot busier too. Only bad thing is the light switch had a Chief sticker on it. Not sure how long that has been there but not a supporter of overtly Chief-loving businesses (ask Friday's in Champaign)."}
{"text":"I second \"Daisy G's\" review below. This is not authentic Thai food. The bubble tea is served hot and the tapioca balls taste like plastic. Very Americanized cuisine (and not in a good way). There are some great Thai places in the area (Bangkok on Mayfield Rd, Map of Thailand downtown, Peppermint Thai in Pepperpike- to name a few of the best). 

I had the pineapple fried rice and pad thai. Both were fairly generic and flavorless. I was very disappointed bc I drove 20 min each way to pickup takeout. And it was NOT worth the cost or the drive. 


Some nice things I can say: 

I was impressed by the amount of vegetarian dishes they had and the chart online it broke down how to make any meal vegetarian or vegan. 

The cream cheese rolls were tasty. 

The staff was nice and the place was super clean. 

I would suggest you skip this place and give an authentic place a try."}
{"text":"3.5 stars if I could and I plan to revisit to reevaluate the heat scale.

Large menu, fair prices, and generous portions. Loved the spring rolls. So far so good.

But their heat scale is a bit off from what I am used to. I am normally happy at a 4/5 out of 10 for Thai food at all the places in the city. So when I ordered by dinner I asked for a 4, but was told they use a scale from 0 to 5 rather than 0 to 10. Falling back to my undergrad Engineering math courses I calculated that half of four is two, so I went with the two on the spice level.

Well, to quote Jessie in Toy Story II--Sweet Mother of Abraham Lincoln!  I was unable to get past a few forks of my curry. I tried shaking the sauce off each piece, smothering it with rice, and even tried beer and Coca Cola, but I quickly gave up and finished the rice while sweat ran down my face. I declined a takeout box.

What I don't know is if this was a mistake or normal.  But if this is really what their two is supposed to be I cannot imagine what a 5 would have been."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that this place replaced Cip's. We came here the day it opened not knowing that and happened to be their first customers! I had the pineapple curry and it was A-MAZ-ING. My husband had the Pad Kee Maw (flat rice noodles) with beef and he loved it. Their spice level is 1-5 instead of 1-10, fyi. Today I went for lunch and had the ginger chicken. It was a little heavy on the oil but that's what makes it good!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with my family on a Saturday night. We had gone to Thai Spoon, first. It was crowded and we didn't have any reservation, so we left empty handed. Did a quick yelp search to find out other good rated eateries nearby. Found \"My Thai\" and off we go. Once we reached, we found the place empty, not good. Still, we wanted to try this place going by yelp ratings. We ordered - crispy spring rolls (shrimp, chicken and veggies) - it was just OK, there was no shrimp in the shrimp rolls. Crab Rangoon was good, I tried this dish for the first time, have to try at other places too. Then, we tried the Veggie Sampler, crispy egg plant was awesome; crispy tofu was good too. After that, we ordered Pad Thai (Chicken), Fried Rice (chicken) and veggie fried rice in entrees. It was again average and chicken was undercooked. Service was good and the lady attended us with care. Overall, an average dine out experience in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Well, honestly, of my favorite Thai places around here, my thai is usually my last resort. I'm pretty sure they are an extension of Siam terrace or are somehow related, but I'm not 100% sure. Now, when it comes to Thai food, I LOVE pad Thai. If there's other food on the table, I won't even taste it because I'll be focused on my pad Thai. I was trying to decide which place had the best pad Thai. I didn't include places where I found the pad Thai to be inedible, like for example Nitaya Thai, so I ended up with my top four favorite thai restaurants in the area. Surprisingly enough, my thai scored second of the four, by a long shot. The top two were absolutely delicious while the second two were very okay. I didn't expect my Thai to come through with such a delicious dish, because I've had their pad Thai before. It's always pretty good, but this time it was delightful, knocking Siam terrace and pho cafe out of the park. While it was extremely delicious that day, if you want a reliably scrumptious dish every time, head to thara Thai."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian food, and possibly my favorite Cleveland-area restaurant! It's on Mayfield Road just 10 minutes or less from 271. Easy to overlook in a little plaza by a Shell station. 

They make everything to order (yet quickly) so if you want to customize the spice level or swap some ingredients, they'll do that without a problem. Rice dishes can all be either white or brown.

It's rare to find true vegetarian Thai  options, but here, nearly very dish on the large menu has a choice of \"meat,\" with crispy tofu as one choice. (Even the \"vegetarian\" sections of most Thai menus have fish or seafood-based sauces if you ask the right person who knows the recipes; and frankly I don't like that smell even if I ate seafood.) If you're vegetarian, just ask for \"no fish sauce.\" Most dishes can be vegan, in fact, but a few have egg or cheese.

My impression is that this isn't authentic, centuries-old Thai cooking, but rather something a little more unique and creative. So that makes it a nice change if you're tired of other Thai food. Dishes range from salty and simple \"comfort food\" (brown, gravy-like sauces) to sweet and sour to spicy. I especially like the creamy dishes: the curries (coconut-milk based).

The menu is huge and widely varied--I've gone back many times and still not run out of new things to try. My favorites: The mango curry, sweet potato curry, cashew stir fry, masaman curry, and some of the fried rice options. And if you like sweet: the Thai Iced Tea/Coffee.

The lunch menu isn't as big, but it's cheap, and you get complimentary soup!

It's also very nice inside; small but well-decorated in a colorful modern style, with bamboo on the tables and nice music. The only problem is if you sit near the door in winter: there's no vestibule, so cold air blows in! But they tend to seat you far from the door when possible.

The service has always been friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Definitely the best affordable Thai I've found in the city so far. We've tried a large selection of the menu and have not been disappointed yet. They really excel in their soups. Their curries are also very good. The Pad See Ew is one of my faves, flavored correctly and cooked well. Overall, very solid and consistent. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Literally a week and a half ago this spot housed a renovated attempt at a local bar that had gone under and sat vacant for nearly a decade or longer.  Just days later this delightful new Thai restaurant popped up in its place!  Featuring lunch specials and dinner plates priced very reasonably \"My Thai\" hits a special spot between value, courteous and quick service, and above all fantastic flavors that abound with seemingly every dish! The ranges of curries alone vary from standard coconut milk based dishes to pumpkin and pineapple.

Overall a very pleasant experience and one that will have me jaunting just a few blocks away to here on hopefully a fairly regular basis!"}
{"text":"Just moved down from Chicago, and I'm across the street from the restaurant. Being a sushi nut, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to feed those terrible cravings this far south. Went in and initially ordered the Pad See You, which was OK, but what caught our eye was the sushi appetizer. 6-8 pieces of Nigiri sushi including; crab, ahi, white tuna, salmon, and huge prawns. 

We've since been back 3 times, exclusively ordering sushi. The nigiri sushi, as well as their sashimi have diverse options you don't see all the time, including scallops. The sushi takes a bit to come out but it is usually amazing and served on a boat. The presentation is out of this world! The chefs' knife skills border on art, and creatively sliced fruit and vegetables accompany the sushi.

Most importantly, the Maki rolls present a lot of options when you are ready to get down to business. A lot of sushi houses will throw sriracha and scallions on top of everything to mask a lack of creativity, but not here. Whether you are into a creamy avocado and salmon roll or like the crunch of tempura and eel, the chefs don't skimp on the style. We even got asparagus spears in our Spider roll. This restaurant is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Since developing severe food allergies I always have a hit or miss with this place.  Several of the staff know and remember what I can order and are totally fine with this because they appreciate my business and want to cater to the customer.  

Other times I've been there or tried to order my regular meal I've  been told no and they won't accommodate me.  I've had to actually leave the building and take my business elsewhere.  

I actually love this place but I'm updating my review to 2 stars because of the inconsistency and how I've felt so small while trying to order a meal.

Remember:  Basil Fried Rice with shrimp.  No sauce, no seasoning, no onions, cook in sesame oil."}
{"text":"Very good Thai cuisine with an excellent lunch special. 

We had Pad Thai and Spicy Basil Fried Rice. Both were excellent with the amount of spiciness requested. 

The Crab Rangoon was unexpectedly good. They were light, not greasy, and tasted of more than just cream cheese. The scallion and crab flavors were actually noticeable. 

Great place, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I usually eat or order Thai from a particular restaurant in Champaign. But, last Sunday I wanted to try another restaurant. My Thai had mixed reviews on Yelp, but still thought of giving it a try. I ordered chicken satay, shumai and tom yum soup online for takeout. My ratings for each item are as follow:
Chicken satay(2.5/5): chicken pieces were cut thick, Peanut sauce was ok, tasted store bought.
Shumai(3.5/5): they tasted good, liked the toasted garlic oil on top.
Tom yum soup(1/5): it tasted so sweet and too sour, there wasn't good balance between sourness and sweetness. Not good.
I was not happy with the food."}
{"text":"Great food. Really enjoyed the chili fried rice with scallops and sampler platter. This was my first time so next time I will ask for it to be  spicier."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up, it was ready on time. The pad thai also had a solid amount of chicken in it. Still, the pad thai was clumpy and a little too sweet. Moreover, the sushi was not fresh at all... it tasted like 3 day old grocery store sushi - soggy, browned avocado, and cheap tasting shrimp. Food quality at this place is average at best."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, coming from San Jose, CA, the land of asian food, I didn't have high hopes for some hole in a wall Thai place in Chesterland. But I was very pleasantly surprised. 
The food is great! I have to say that the pad-thai was one of the best I've ever had; and I've eaten in many Thai places before. 
It's quiet, friendly, quick service. 
My only problem with the place is that it was real hot inside. It was one of those warm days outside, real nice, but inside was just way hot and a bit stuffy. 
Add AC and this place becomes priceless!"}
{"text":"Such an adorable place! Adorable because they have dancers!!!! Not cheesy back-up dancers, but real dancers, that do traditional dancing. I wish I could tell you exactly what it is, but I assume it's tied in with the culture. 

The ladies came out a handful of times, in beautiful costumes (a different one each time!) and did dances for us. They were perfectly synced and entrancing to watch. I'd give the place lots of stars for this alone!

But let's get to the food. I always have to go with the traditional Pad Thai dish when I check a new place out. I love it loaded with veggies and shrimp. The dish was great! I asked for a touch of spice. While it really wasn't spicy at all, they did bring out extra spices which I was able to add for a little kick. 

I love that they have a bar too (I know, I seem like a lush!). But the place down the street doesn't have one and there's not a lot of great restaurant and bar options around here, so this is perfect! Plus, the menu is good! I was able to get a delicious glass of Malbec for $6.50. 

I'm so excited to make this my new spot, plus I get entertained as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious dishes to choose from on the menu : the pumpkin curry & Thai tea was to die for!! Fresh spring rolls & garlic shrimp ( jumbo ) were fantastic as well. Clean place, nice music, thoughtfully done atmosphere...friendly service . Definitely coming back!! Live Thai dancer on Thur & Sun nights 6-9 PM."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love this place. The owner and those who work there are super nice. I especially like the vegetable spring rolls. They are flakey and very tasty.  Some other people had complaints, but we always enjoy eating there. Give the place a chance, I think you will like it."}
{"text":"Now that's some good Thai food! My husband is a picky eater so I'll just put that out there. He LOVED his chicken Thai fried rice. I have to admit, it was delicious. We asked for a mild level of spiciness. It was the prefect balance of flavor and spice. My beef and broccoli was right on point. The fresh brewed iced tea was very refreshing. The service was great. This place is definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"The crab Rangoon is the best we've had. We really enjoyed the Pad Thai. It was enough for two of us to share."}
{"text":"I went to My Thai today for lunch after hearing they have great lunch specials.  I'm also a huge fan of Siam Terrace, and I heard it was owned by the same people. I was much less impressed with this place.

The place was pretty empty, maybe 3 or 4 tables on a Friday at noon. The wait staff was OK, but nothing to rave about. The silverware was dirty, and we had to ask for a new pair.  The lunch special was 8-10 dishes to choose from + you get soup or a salad for $8.00.  Not a great deal for the area in my opinion. 

The salad was 3 or four pieces of lettuce, a slice of cucumber, and a slice of tomato.  All in all 3 or 4 bites of food- not worth a lot if you ask me.  I got the pad Thai as usual and it was good food- just as good as Siam Terrace, I'm pretty sure identical to Siam Terrace. The portion was smaller because it was lunch.

My advice: if you have time to drive to downtown Urbana, I would go to Siam Terrace, better service, and more selection on the menu."}
