{"text":"One of the best Pakistani restaurants in the GTA.  Don't go in expecting good service or decor or even regular plates (as you get paper plates).  It's all about the food here.  Besides some of their vegetarian dishes (not their specialty), everything reliably always tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Really good Indian/Pakistani food.  I've been coming here for at least 10 years and it's come a long way in terms of expanding the sizes. Still the same furniture though - by that I mean the plastic patio chairs and tables. But you don't come here for the luxurious surroundings.   Food is good - beef kabobs, chicken kabobs,  paneer, butter chicken, biryani - I've had it all. All authentic, so be prepared for a meal filled with butter, oils and deep fried fair.  Naan is really good - fresh and soft.   The price of the food is quite high compared to other Indian restaurants. But it's not outrageous like others I've been to.    For an on the go experience, grab a wrap - beef is my fave. ask for extra lettuce and onions because otherwise you're getting 2 pieces of lettuce and one piece of onion on a naan with the meat."}
{"text":"A neighbourhood staple, Lahore Tikka House is located on Gerrard East in the heart of little India. They do one thing and do it well: Halal Pakistani cuisine. The space is fairly plain, the decor is mostly barebones, and they've been 'under renovations' for the last few years. Despite that, this place seems to run seamlessly and churns some serious Indian food. Outdoors they have a large patio where the huge indoor space can spill over to in the warmer months once the restaurant gets busy, which it inevitably does. If the seating is full and there's a line at the door, no worries, this place has a great takeout service, which I usually get. Just call ahead, and it's usually piping hot and set for pickup in about 20 minutes.  Flaky with hint of spice and smokiness, Lahore's samosas are better than your average samosas on the Gerrard. But my usual order includes the Vegetable Biryani. It's a huge portion of perfectly cooked Basmati rice, tomaotes, peppers, cauliflower, chickpeas, potatoes, and a mild blend of tumeric, cumin, and chili powder. I also love their Paneer cheese. The squeaky Indian cheese is an unaged curd cheese that is denser than tofu, but seems to absorb flavours just the same.  Lahore serves their Paneer Tikka Masala, and in my opinion, it's the city's best. Lightly seared and tandoor, it's served in a smoky, slightly spicy sauce; it's made the way it should be. And of course, be sure to order a side of their naan bread. Not only is it lightly oiled, seasoned, and softly charred, but it's also perfect for making sure you soak up all of the sauce.  Next time you're looking for some Indian food, forget all those 'all you can eat' buffets and head to Lahore Tikka House on Gerrard East. It sets the bar pretty high for good Indian food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Second time to this restaurant , decor is as if you're in east Asia   Restaurant was pretty busy but there was more than enough staff to give a speedy service. Food came pretty fast with quality. We ordered naan, rice and  Lamb kabab and chicken karachi , all tasted great. Did learn the owner are not Pakistani but from Uganda., but the kitchen staff  and front staff are from Bangladesh, India,Pakistan and Nepal     Pretty good experience. Will return !  Oh ya, they have private parking."}
{"text":"How did this place get good reviews? No qualms about the atmosphere. It's grungy but different and fun. The service was great. Unfortunately, the positive comments do not extend to the food. The palaak paneer was the worst I've had - watery tasting and very oily. We also ordered beef kiryani on our server's recommend. The beef was tough and the dish bland, despite us having requested extra spiciness. The vegetarian sizzler combo was ok, much better than the other dishes. The naan was also just ok, but I expected a stretchier, tastier bread.  We will not be back and didn't even take the leftovers home."}
{"text":"Sadly the quality of the food has declined to the point where this is our last trip here. As well, although the long awaited building is done it's still too cold, we are sitting on plastic chairs at a plastic table eating with plastic utensils off styrofoam plates. I suspect an ownership change since the great days when we sat in an old burger place eating fun food.  I miss that place."}
{"text":"Food was just OK. I've had better. Expected more considering the prices were allot higher than many other Indian restaurants in Toronto.  Felt like I could have gotten 2 dishes for the same price elsewhere. Although portion was large, could have done with smaller portions and lower price. Service was good. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Best Indian/Pakistani food I've ever eaten out for. This place is great.  Recommend the chicken tikka masala, naan, aloo gobi, and beef/lamb kebab."}
{"text":"Best Indian/Pakistani food I have had in Canada. The prices are little high but I think it is returned with the atmosphere of the restaurant.   So my favorite dish is the chicken tikka masala. The food is a bit oily but that is only a minor drawback of an otherwise fantastic meal. The food is full of flavor and color and it is obvious that all of their food is made from scratch and in house.  Be sure to have the Kulfi before you leave. A frozen treat that ends with a little surprise!"}
{"text":"Raised their prices by 30%, reduced the quality of the service and spices.  We've been going here for ages, its unfortunate the decline of quality that has occurred here.  cannot recommend this place anymore. Find somewhere else to go for authentic Pakistani food."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for butter chicken and kabobs. Love the food!"}
{"text":"4 stars for quality of food and 5 stars for experience and atmosphere. This place is a must to everyone who loves south Asian food and culture. Usually a few min wait time, so I suggest walking around and exploring the area a bit. Make sure you get the kabobs!"}
{"text":"Food * service * Ambience **  I have been here twice now and both times the food just sucked. Yday, we got a take out. We got vege biryani and panneer tikka masala.. the rice was smelling spoiled by the time we got home. The taste of the food is not that great either. Won't go back."}
{"text":"This placed honestly USED to be amazing, hence my return last night.  I ordered chicken karahi, butter chicken and chicken kabobs.    The CHICKEN karahi had LAMB pieces in it...must I say more? The butter chicken was sooooo watered down that there was no taste to it.   This place has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"This place may not look tasty, but the food certainly is. Everything came out proper, hot and fresh. There were a few things I didn't like. First, there are no waiters, meaning you are seated them given a white board to write your order on, then you take it to the front desk and they record your order and hand you a number to take to your table. The food is then brought to you. Also, if you ask for water you will be given a very small glass, it looked like a shot glass to be honest. They don't give you a jug of water, instead people walk around refilling your water. If you are coming here just for the food, and don't mind tiny glasses and taking your own order then go to this place, the food is great. If you are looking for a fancy place ... You might want to pass."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time for my Indian food fix.. As my Indian wife used to visit little India all the time and we would usually end up here for dinner. That said, my order tonight couldn't have been worse.. Talk about greasy.. All my favs tasted so bad I basically gave up after a few mouthfuls. Also, the portions were  barely enough for 1 person and at $60+ for 3 items I was totally upset. The biryani was the only thing edible in the mix, but you can only eat so much of that on its own .. I have eaten more Indian food than I thought possible over the last 20yrs, so when I say I know what Indian food is supposed to taste like .. Well this was not it!! I can only hope that this was a one off, as they are a huge constant in the area.. Fingers crossed!!"}
{"text":"Simply put, amazing pakistani/indian food: incredibly rich curries with fresh ingredients and perfectly cooked tikka chicken (nice light char but still soft and moist).  The atmosphere--apparently still under construction?--feels a bit like a church basement (mosque basement perhaps?) with unfinished floors/walls and plastic furniture, but it goes along with the seemingly-home-cooked-by-someone's-grandma, you're-in-on-a-local-secret food."}
{"text":"Lahore Tikka House. I have a love/hate relationship with this place. The food is mostly good, but I cant stand the curry smell that persistently invades my clothes if i have been here for more than 5 minutes. What makes reeking like curry afterwards, and using up half a bottle of Febreze worth it occasionally: - The Biryani here, its greasy, filling, and all the rice is evenly flavoured, just as it should be. my favourite is lamb or beef.  - The naans are super fresh, the butter till naan is soft and fresh and great to accompany the kebabs and curries. Love. - The Karhai Gosht (morsels of lamb cooked with a not very saucy, tomato and onion based curry) is good as well. Also try the fried fish. The chicken tikka is mild and decent.  - Kashmiri Chai, I can go to this place for this chai alone.. I sometimes run inside get them to give me this chai to go and i often buy more than one for myself, as it only comes in a small serving. Its made by boiling green tea leaves with milk, and adding saffron, cardamom and pistachios and almonds. Supposed to be sweet and piping hot. This is the best place in India Bazar that sells it.  - Kulfi, denser than icecream (it isnt whipped), comes in many flavours, i recommend the cardamom or pistachio flavour. Perfect end to a spicy meal in the summer.  The not-so-authentic and stuff that can be improved: - The kebabs are decent, not the best i have had, but i like the fish, and boti kebab. The Sizzlers some with chunks of green peppers and onions, more of a filler for the plate than a complimentary flavour. Its never traditionally served this way, and i think that's for a reason.  - Rice Sizzlers, just don't do it. You'll be eating plain rice for the most part, because the sizzler doesn't have enough gravy to flavour the rice. Another concept invented by Lahore tikka house. If you do end up stuck with one of these, make sure you order plenty of raita to douse your rice in.  Overall, if you really crave Indian food, stick to the more authentic stuff and you wont be dissapointed. Buy a bottle of febreze beforehand and be prepared, or get takeout if you can. Try to avoid the grimey bathrooms. Lahore Tikka House is currently under renovations, although still operating. They are finally moving into a ACTUAL building, as opposed to the corrugated metal shack they were operating from. I hope they will have better ventilation and facilities, so i can stand going here much more often."}
{"text":"Shit food. Shit customer service and dirty plates and utensils. The old lady at the cash is very rude and was yelling at the staff who were working hard. Would never recommend anyone to come to this place"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!!! Great great great food! Must try the fried lamb and the curry chicken! Casual and very clean. The food was delicious we would go back at any time!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place! Once you eat here, you're spoiled and no other place can measure up!  I've been eating here at least 1-2 times a month for about 6 years now. It's just fantastic, and the food and service make up for the Styrofoam plates and plastic cutlery. Every time I have a guest in from out of town, THIS is where I take them. My boyfriend always jokes that it's the only place he's ever eaten where he can't help but make yummy-noises with every single bite. I used to live right around the corner, but even though I'm in north Toronto now, we still make the drive frequently to get our Lahore Tikka fix!  Every time we come we get the butter chicken, palak paneer, channa masala, aloo ghobi, and several rice and naan, with sweet lassi. In the summer, I'll get a kulfi which they make in-house and which is just fantastic, and in the winters I'll sometimes indulge in their Kashmir tea that they make at your table for you. I've never once been disappointed in all the times I've been there.  It has a nice community feel, with the big open-concept dining room. I LOVE in summer time when they open up a huge covered patio for diners. Although the staff there is huge - which is great, because you always get great attendant service - they make you feel at home. Several of the servers there always recognize me, and give me a big welcome, asking how I've been, cracking jokes about how recently I've been in, or noticing if something kept me away for awhile.   Everything is made fresh, and it comes out sizzling. The flavors are deep, and complex, with just the right amount of spice - makes your nose run, but doesn't flay your tongue and palette! Be prepared to have your clothes smell of curry when you leave...but it's SOOOOOO worth it!"}
{"text":"Almost perfect indian food.  How to make it better?  Loose the styrofoam plates and plastic forks.  Otherwise an interesting experience with top notch indian food.   Much better than 99% of indian food in the GTA."}
{"text":"I love eating here, the food is soo good. I've been here a few times and every single dish I have ordered was yummy. My fave are the kabobs, they are delicious! And the mango lassi yumm!"}
{"text":"Dear Folks,  Kindly pls, do not visit this pathetic place. Ive been coming here since 2 years on a regular basis and bringing in different guests everytime, and guess what ??? ... my patience keeps running out bit by bit on every visit. It crossed its limit yesterday when I took my West indian friend there to eat. First and the most important point to remember is - NEVER GO THERE ON A WEEKEND. BECAUSE THEY DONT TREAT CUSTOMERS LIKE KINGS THERE ON WEEKENDS, FOOD IS JUST THROWN ON YOUR TABLE AND COLD AND ABSOLUTELY TASTELESS. REASON BEING, \"THEY HAVE MANY CUSTOMERS COMING ON WEEKENDS RIGHT, THEY BELIEVE IN SERVING QUANTITY TO COVER ALL TABLES, RATHER THAN QUALITY. Infact yesterday when we ordered Beef Kebabs, they arrived all cold and looked just as if they were taken out from the freezer and out on a grill for a few minutes. My guest was unimpressed. When we told the server regarding this he gave us an excuse which \"If he was working in my office, i would have fired him on the spot\". He says \" Sir you ordered only 2 kebabs so they dont come on the sizzling hot platter they come in a plate and if you would have told us that you need it to be sizzling hot we would have given it to you like that.\" HOW RUDE AND OUTRAGEOUS CAN THAT ANSWER BE, as a customer you are bound to serve me with hot food, and I should not be requesting you to serve me hot food, because in that case it would be better for Lahore tikka to buy a LOCK and shut down the restaurant with a PATHETIC SERVICE like that.  The servers, moreover were not interesting in serving, they were loafing around and grouping together whenever they saw some girl walk in who was attractive, now how cheap is that? Next case, we ordered the lamb biryani which i have ben ordering since 2 years now. This time they crossed the limit. The biryani had only 5 pieces of poorly cut and minor lamb.  I was furious and burst out on the server telling him that \"Firstly, the kebabs were cold, now the biryani is cold and i can see only 5 pieces of lamb in there, to which he says sir we serve only 5 pieces.\" I replied back with anger on my face saying \"are you lying to me outright, listen pal ive been coming here since 2 years and I have always got more than 8 to 9 pieces of lamb for a price of 10$, are you telling me you people serve only 5 pieces of lamb with some tasteless rice for $10.\" He had not answer and just pretended things were in control.  My guest at this point was very upset, as she said she didnt enjoy any aspect of the food nor the place. She said she didnt expect the place to so shabby and low key, to which i had no answer. And she insisted that we leave right away. All my appetite and my urge to have a good weekend dinner at this pathetic place was ruined. I'd rather go into a good Indian restaurant where there is class and the service is disciplined. This pakistani restaurant needs to revamp their surrounding, change their servers and hire polite people who dont bullshit you when you know exactly whats going on. OVERALL PLS DONT BULLSHIT THE BULLSHITTER, WITH YOU OVER PRICED UNDER DELICIOUS AND CHEAP QUALITY SERVICE.  FOLKS MY ADVISE, IF YOU WANT TO GO TO LAHORE TIKKA, MY HUMBLE REQUEST ... DONT GO, you would only end up being disappointed, the reason being we brown folks know exactly what the food should be like, but to the rest of the ethnicites who dine there, have no clue as to how much they are actually paying for pathetic food.  MANY THANKS"}
{"text":"Lahore Tikka has always been a lifelong favourite spot. Unfortunately after the passing few years ago of the original owner, the new management hasn't been the best. I've come over the past few years, the food is still amazing but something or the other is consistently going wrong when ordering. The service has become mediocre. The menu has changed and price has gone up but the service and the authenticity of the place has been tarnished. My most recent visit, the ordertaker/cashier left her training at home or never had any to begin with, which is most probable. Sidenote: bussers are still friendly as ever."}
{"text":"Awesome food..love chicken biryani and kababs. Everytime I have been there, quality has never diminished. Only downside - it's in downtown they should open up another location in GTA"}
{"text":"Really spicy and oily food.   You will eat from Styrofoam plate and cup. Plastic fork and knife. Even if you order food with meat, it's minimum amount of meat, you can hardly see the meat in any kind of dish. We had 5 different dishes, all were oily, spicy and really and small.  Would Not come back here."}
{"text":"Definitely place to go for good Pakistani, Indian food. You have to write things you want off the menu on a board,and take them to register to order. Loved their lahori kulfi for desert"}
{"text":"Went there last week with cousins who came from States. It was a Saturday night. The service is very mediocre as no one cones to your table to take an order. You write the menu on a white board and take it to the front cashier. The servers bring the food one by one; the last dish came 20 mins after the first was served. Culinary is extremely cheap with Styrofoam plates and plastic utensils to eat from. The portions are a joke. It's like ordering a kid's happy meal. We ordered several dishes and they all had such small portions. They really try to make their money by you ordering more dishes as it will not fill you up. However the food is quite delicious hence I am giving it 3 stars. Also if you prefer a cozy environment to dine in,  forget it. Every 5 mins,  the servers bring the dhol out and start playing it loud by someone's table if it's their birthday."}
{"text":"Forget every other Pakistani restaurant, or Indian for that matter in Toronto. I would like to say Canada, but lets get real, nobody is going to drive for five days from the west coast or drop a couple of grand on plane ride just to eat - maybe if you are a billionaire.  I spent a work sojourn in Pakistan during the late seventies and early eighties. My two favourite haunts were the kebab stands on Queen's Road that were close to my hotel and The Kebabeesh in Gulberg. By Pakistani standards these places were expensive but if one was earning North American Dollars, a meal for two was about 40Rs on Queen's Road and 100Rs in Gulberg (One Dollar equalled Ten Rupees then). One hundred Rupees was about one weeks pay for the average local. This about what you will pay at Lahore Tikka with virtually the same style of food. It's where you go for truly authentic Pakistani Punjabi cuisine.  Lahore Tikka does not particularly cater to vegetarians. They have such dishes but I will never forget the owner of Rashid Carpets in Lahore telling me \"why are you eating vegetables, you can afford meat\". Pakistan is a big country of meat eaters. Try some of the Bhel Pouri houses just down the road to the east or the Dosa house in the next block if you are searching out the finest in non meat dishes.  This is not the place you go if you want some fake Taj Mahal marble walls and tacky wall paper, the type that plagues the upscale South Asian restaurants. It is down right rustic. It is like eating under a big top with picnic tables for several hundred. When they first opened, the kitchen was a converted Dairy Queen takeaway.  The Seekh Kebab is so tender and comes with a salad chutney and naan just like you get on Queen's Road. Everything is succulent not over spiced but definitely not underspiced. Chicken just falls off the bone and the tikka melts like candy in your mouth. Don't look for alcohol, in Pakistan alcohol is never served at a tikka house and it is illegal to serve in restaurants anyway, except to tourists. Respect our Muslim brothers' faith. If you want to break from tradition and spoil your meal with booze, then there are many non-Muslim owned licensed restaurants on Gerrard.  What ever you do, don't order Butter Chicken. Butter Chicken is about as Pakistani as Fish and Chips. Butter Chicken is rumored to have originated in Delhi and that is not in Pakistan. Try the real stuff."}
{"text":"Plastic cutlery, decent food, not as authentic but packed with lots of flavor. They made us leave our stroller at the waiting area and had to lug our belongings to the table. Being from Hyderabad, I was craving Haleem and ordered some - it was just OK. The biryani and kababs were good, very greasy but this is the nature of Indo/Paki cuisine. Had to wait about 20 minutes for the first dish to arrive. Gotta add that they gave our little one crayons, a coloring book and some new toys as well. Will make another trip for sure. Perhaps on a weekday."}
{"text":"GO HERE FOR AUTHENTIC PAKISTANI FOOD!  My family and I were in Toronto this weekend visiting from the U.S. My dad said he wanted to come to Toronto just to go here, and I have to say it was well worth it. First, I'd like to point out that this restaurant is authentic PAKISTANI food, not Indian food by any means, like some people are saying.  We were sat in a reasonable amount of time, despite the huge crowd of people are waiting outside. We went inside and I was amazed by the scene. From the huge outdoor tent seating to the tandoor they were cooking the naans in; it felt like stepping into Pakistan. My dad being incredibly excited, ordered naan, the beef nihari, haleem, karahi gosht, goat biryani, and afghani chicken tikka. We wanted to try the beef kabobs but were too full, so we asked one of the servers to bring just one out, asking if that was possible, and his response was \"anything is possible here.\" The service was wonderful.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and everything looked incredible, and it all tasted even better. My parents both said it was the best Pakistani food they've had since moving to the U.S. That's a bold statement, I know, but I couldn't agree with them more. And they are originally from Lahore, so if that's not saying something, I don't know what will. If you want to try some of the best Pakistani food around, GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Well order the few dishes.... overall food was ok but did not like few things.. the food was way too oily and the service. Maybe i should had order something else. I wish they had better service, get rid of styrofoam plates!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very bad and unhygienic. We ordered paneer tikka masala.that was really bad inly 6 pieces were there and it was not worth and the rest of food like green boneless chicken and lahori kabab were also tasteless.i was very disappointed and my bill was $40. Too expensive"}
{"text":"My youngest is asleep, in the stroller, every parents dream - to eat in peace... The girl at the front tells me they have a \"No stroller policy\" (no stroller in dining area)  I pleaded that our youngest was sleeping, please let us have a corner seat, and I pointed to an empty corner. Her solution was; She should hold the baby and eat... Second solution put two chairs together for child to sleep.. Clearly the manager doesn't have any children or owners care to keep a customer.  I pleaded to let us sit somewhere with this tiny stroller and a sleeping baby. What's worse... A screaming baby = bad for business. Not caring about a customer = loss of revenue X many year's.  Worst customer service ever, from waitress to \"Manager\" He watched my family walk out... unbelievable. I went to Chandi Chowk and received the Best service and free kulfi for my kids...."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best North Indian / Pakistani food that Toronto has to offer.  The service can sometimes be spotty, with things coming out at different times (food arrives but no naan), but the food more than makes up for it.  The Haleem is quite good."}
{"text":"We ate lamb biryani, curry lamb, and lentils. The food was delicious! Perfect! Service was good, the place was clean."}
{"text":"5 stars for authentic pakistani food!! The chicken karahi and naan did feel like food back home from corner karahi stores. The decore did look a little dated but when the food's so good, who cares!!  We went around 5pm and it wasn't crazy busy but the hostess was telling us its gets crazy busy later on. So 5pm felt like the perfect time to go. We had salt lassi which was very refreshing. Oh and they pass around green chili on skewers if you want some. Brilliant!! It just took us forever to get there from core downtown though. Will definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent for Indian food lunch. Though the service was sometimes a little slow, the dishes were tasty and hot. Garlic naan, chick peas, aloo gobi (Cauliflower)--superb!  Bathrooms need more frequent servicing. But I'm all about the food."}
{"text":"I am shocked at the reviews on Yelp.   This restaurant is the best non-fine dining South Asian restaurant in the city.  Don't expect fancy furniture, don't expect not to eat in a portable, don't expect to have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom, don't expect to eat off stainless steel cutlery or drink out of non-disposable glasses, and don't expect not to stink...  The kebabs are amazing... the chicken tikka appetizers are amazing... the pickled chili is wonderfully salty.. the kashmiri chai is aromatic... the service is friendly... and you feel like you are \"home\"... if home is in Punjab, Pakistan.  Fantastic restaurant - my favorite part about it is the diversity of the clientele.  If you want good Punjabi cooking, eat there!"}
{"text":"I am sure, non the people writing reviews, and the owner of this restaurant, are aware of the real authentic food, and how is it served, and what is it eaten with. Making a fool out of everyone. Learn how to cook, and learn how to eat our delicate, yet delicious cuisine."}
{"text":"Nice papri chat but \"not that great\" gol gappas ..."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian food place in Toronto. Extremely inexpensive for the amount and quality of the food provided. Its wonky layout is best appreciated in the summer when you can wind your way through the constantly-under-renovation facilities, past the trailers, through the active kicthen, past the ridiculously fancy washrooms (with towel service), and finally out to the patio - under the lights and colourful tarps. Amazing. End the evening with a walk through little India. You'll need it to help digest."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Indian food in Little India. Food is fantastic. However it can get pricey if you keep ordering tasty dishes. I generally do takeout from here as the parking is very limited.  Loses a couple stars as the ambiance could be a lot better (paper plates, Styrofoam cups, picnic table tablecloths). As long as you aren't taking a first date here, you should be good to enjoy."}
{"text":"This place qualifies as an epic meal. Sometimes you go for the food, sometimes great service... Lahore Tikka House was for the experience! We sat in plastic chairs, eating out of styrofoam, in a portable with colourful cloths draped over the walls. I felt like I was in another country.   Food was tasty, highlights were butter chicken, kebabs, mattar paneer, and biryani. Liked how there was tons of fresh herbs. Didn't like how oily it was.   I dont understand why they don't move all the patio furniture to the building where the bathroom is. It might not be finished, but surely its better than the portables..."}
{"text":"I came here years ago with my family and I remember it was so so good.  I am not sure if the owners changed or chef changed or what but I went recently with my family and we were all looking forward to the good food. But it was a HUGE disappointment.  We ordered the lamb kabob, beef kabob, butter naans, naans, tarka daal, hara chicken masala boti, aloo gobi, lahori kufi, mango kulfi, papri chaat.   The lamb kabob and beef kabob tasted the same and both were bland, with no flavour. Tarka daal had no flavour (the tarka was def missing) and even could have used more salt. The aloo gobi was too oily and all I tasted was bland gobi with lots of oil. The mango kulfi tasted like plastic mango.  The naans were good, the hara chicken masala boti were good, and the papri chaat was good, and the lahori kulfi was good.  As well, prices have gone up and portion sizes have gone down.  Overall: disappointing experience, I don't we will return!"}
{"text":"My favourite indian food in town! Service is a little strange as they ask that you write your orders on a whiteboard and bring it up to the desk. There is usually a wait so arrive half an hour before just to make sure that you don't starve waiting. Love their butter chicken, paneer with spinach, beef kebabs and chicken biryani. We always order way more than we can finish so we have leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"Worse service & food!! This place use to be great not anymore...!! Service Suck!! We had 3 different Waiters came to ask same question,, not one waiter is assigned to the table! Food came out within 4 minutes!! Hmmmm?? How long does it take to cook Lamb Carahi ?? Kabobs? Chicken tikkas?? It was not fresh at all... We were 8 of us!!! All of us had food POISNING with in 2 hours!!! WORSE PLACE EVEER!!"}
{"text":"Ownership/management has changed and the service and quality has taken a big hit. This place is no longer what it used to be. On a recent Saturday night, I placed my order and after waiting of 20 minutes, I was informed that they had run out of kebabs. In the past, the food used to fly out of the kitchen in minutes. It was also ridiculous as kebabs are one of their main features. Even our server whispered to us that the new management is quickly ruining the experience for many loyal and repeat customers. The emphasis on price hikes and cost cuts is sure to drive customers away. I have been going to this restaurant for many years and I certainly will not be returning. The food quality is also not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I went with my boyfriend a couple of months ago.    I ordered the vegetarian combo, I don't remember what he had. We are both huge fans of Pakistani food, but we were both very dissapointed and felt this restaurant didn't hold up to the hype.    As someone who regularly eats authentic Indian and Pakistani food (twice to three times a week) I thought the food was way too greasy and gave us huge stomach aches. Same thing happened with my Pakistani friends who went here, as well as a lot of people at my work.   We both feel it wasn't worth the price, and we aren't coming back."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday for very first time. Their kebabs are really good. We ordered beef seekh kebab and chicken biriyani. And the 3 stars goes only to the kebabs. The biriyani was cold, less spice and the rice was totally undercooked. Probably the worse biriyani I have ever tasted. Mango shake wasn't good either. When you talk about mango shake it lassi, you expect something cold not in room temperature. Overall our experience was okay."}
{"text":"It was my first time going here, I had heard good stuff but after today's experience I wouldn't even go back if they offered me free food. I don't think they are aware of what authentic Pakistani/Indian cuisine is. We waited 40 minutes in line to get a table, once we were told we had one and were escorted to a table we had to stand and wait 5 minutes because the servers were confused. We ordered our food and thankfully I asked if anything had peanuts and found out the butter chicken did but there was no mention of allergies or ingredients on the menu. If I hadn't asked I would have gotten a reaction. After ordering the food came fairly quick but we had to ask our server 4 times to bring out mango shakes. To pack our left over we had to get up ourselves and grab the containers from a table since the server never came back for 10 minutes with it. The chicken biryani had barely 3 pieces of chicken, it was almost just rice and the rice was burnt at the bottom. For the price, quantity and quality it was an absolute waste of time. I would never consider going back. The place was a mess, highly disorganized. If that's how disorganized they are outside, I don't want to imagine what is going on in the kitchen. I would not eat their food again."}
{"text":"Worst place ever , cold food , bad service , overpriced . Do not go to Lahore Tikka House please . They warm their food when you order it , meaning it's pre cooked . Don't ever go there , you will be dissapointed . My name for this place is : GARBAGE . My girl and I walked out . It's very bad . More geared to people who don't know what Indian / Pakistani food tastes like . More for people that just want to eat bland and Cold  Indian / Pakistani  food and want to pay through the roof . Do not go there . Waste of money on garbage . We ordered Butter Chicken , Ribs and Palak Paneer with Naan , all 4 dishes came out cold . In fact , the paneer was nearly frozen in the middle . The Naan I think they Microwave . I think the Naans from a store rather than it being cooked in a tandoor oven . WTF ? Even the food , because its already cooked , they frigin Microwave it . Lol . We sent it all back and walked out . People , there are thousands of Indian / Pakistani restaurants out there with way better service , food , cost etc . Go there . GUARANTEED ,  Lahore Tikka will dissapoint you . What a GARBAGE PLACE . I hope this post is helpful to the people who haven't been there yet ."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the amazing food with fast service. The cons: PAPER plates... small Styrofoam cups?? so ghetto. Keep up to your standards and serve on actual dinner plates with actual glasses! It was nice that they were open late. My family and I ended up going to dinner at 11:30 almost 12 a.m. I just think they could do a lot better. I literally felt like I was in New Delhi."}
{"text":"Delicious food in generous portions! A bit out of the way, but worth making the trek out. When they say the food's  spicy, they mean it, so if you're a first timer, stick with some of their milder stuff, and don't miss out on their amazing deserts!"}
{"text":"I think I'll going to give up on this place, every time I go there I like less and less. How can some one charge you $14 for cauliflower and potatoes when their isn't a single piece of cauliflower in the dish?! My GF made mention of this to the women who takes order and receives the cash, her reaction was like\" it was not a big deal \", I'm way to busy to help you. The worse part of that one particular meal was afterward, we both had diarrhoea and felt sick for a day. Funny we paid $60 to get sick."}
{"text":"HALAL Its true, the atmosphere is tacky. They are slowly developing.  They finally opened up their other side that was under construction for like 10 years. Maybe 10 years from today you'll see new interior decor.  BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT! They use styrofoam cups and plates for the hundreds of people they serve each day instead of just washing plates.  Its pretty messed up that they serve you food in styrofoam plates, very bad impression.  THE FOOD IS OFF THE HEEZIE.  Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan is unlike any other I've had."}
{"text":"So three things really sum this place up.   1) the atmosphere is about as bad as it gets. imagine eating in a tire shop, off of old lawn furniture and styrofoam plates. the walls are covered in fabrics and tape, you sit at tables 14 people long, and the lighting is stings of christmas lights and shop lamps.  then imagine there being no real rhyme or reason to the ordering system.- order drinks from the server, food from the cashier, take a number, and one of maybe ten servers brings it out in no real order.  2) they have a really nice bathroom, and thats totally weirds 3) the food is ridiculously good, and makes up for all the craziness of the place. naan to die for, biryani thats is so full of flavour you want to roll around on the ground clutching your tummy. and if you are lucky, this guy walks around with grilled peppers sometimes. they are great.   all in all, a landmark, albeit a nutty one."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for my birthday, I always wanted to check it out.  The food was amazing, I would definitely recommend the beef short ribs as well as the kebabs.  One of my fave restaurants in the city! Great food on picnic benches and paper plates, makes no sense, but totally amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Served on styrofoam plates for some reason. Friendly staff. Crazy and sort of intriguing atmosphere."}
{"text":"We visited on Sunday May 24th, 2015 afternoon. Place was packed up. Lines were long. Food was ok but our waitress Soha was exceptional. She was dealing with 6 tables (30 people simultaneously). She won our recognition because of her speed of service, helpful attitude and her big smile. Keep up Soha.  Ajaz and Farah Latif"}
{"text":"The Pakistani food here is delicious. And the service is super fast! As you arrive at your table, the servers hand you a \"whiteboard\" and dry erase marker, so you can write down what you want.  This is very clever, so the servers know exactly what you ordered. You're also given a number, and you pay your bill at the till at the front. As for the food... I find the butter chicken here too spicy, so if you're not used to super hot foods, but sure to ask for a side of yogurt.  The lamb biryani, gobi aloo, palak paneer, and kofi ice cream are super good! Be sure to order the kofi ice cream popsicles,  And if you've never had a milky sweet rose drink with noodles in it called Faluta, it is highly recommended. Good Kashmiri Tea too. This place is always packed, but your food comes in five minutes. Dont let the busyness or ambience intimidate you... You'll love Tikka Lahore. They also just recently \"upgraded\" from paper plates to real glass plates- good move guys! This restaurant is highly recommended. The food is yummy, the service is fast, and the servers are attentive. It's always busy here for a reason."}
{"text":"My and wife went to this place on a friday night. Very busy and like the new renovations. The venue has a nice south asian atmosphere feeling. Ordered the chicken jalfrazi, chicken biryani, seekh kebab and some lassi. Food took long as it was very busy. Service is really bad, waiters are very rude and sweating really bad. Wonder how much sweat falls in to ppls food bc there is no ac here i guess. Food came after a long time. The biryani was really cold and stale. Told the waiter and he gave this dirty look and asked me if i can put my finger in there and see if its warm. I made me really upset that he would ask me to actually stick my finger in the biryani to check the temperature. Anyways he took it and brought the same dish back, obviously warming it in a microwave. Will never go again."}
{"text":"Lahore Tikka is a loud, busy and overall exuberant restaurant serving very good Indo-Pakastani food.  Even with the crowds on Saturday night we were seated quickly, brought menus and told to order at the counter inside.  There is outdoor seating in 2 styles, simple tables at the front and tables under a tent like awning along the side.  Even though it was just my son and me, we ordered with the expectation of taking home leftovers.    We had the Tandoori roasted lamb skewers, butter chicken, biryani rice w/ chicken, Palak paneer (spinach & cheese) and garlic naan.  Again, despite the crowds, the food arrived quickly.  The standout was the tandoori lamb, as others have commented on the Tandoori items.  Everything was tasty and fresh, perhaps not as subtlety  prepared or plated as Dhaba or the old Cuisine of India but still better than many Indian restaurants around town.    We finished off with a couple of Kulfi frozen treats and plenty of leftovers.   Just over $50.  Btw, terrific to see a really multi cultural crowd on our visit, really Toronto."}
{"text":"Took my mom here during the day for lunch since it always seems to be busy during dinner times in the night, and we end up eating somewhere else on Gerrard.   Karahi Gosht- 4 stars  Naan - 4 stars beef sheekh kebab- 3.5 stars chicken seekh kebab - 3.5 stars  The place itself gives you a feel of being in PakiLand! It's fun, and has a rickshaw and a taqat outside. The service was good, however I thought it was totally ghetto that you have to write down your own order on a white board and hand it over to the cashier. Why can't they just take your order at the register?? For the portions i think this place is way overpriced. If they wanna be ghetto about the ordering system then they need to bring down the prices to match it up.  They don't have a lunch special either. It's the same menu prices all day, every day. Negative!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place many times and I must say they are doing a great job. Food and service are at its best.  I love the atmosphere traditional and nothing to fancy but always busy and up to standards. I must say one of my favourites."}
{"text":"First time visitor and was very impressed with the food, atmosphere, and service. Was a busy Saturday night and staff made sure to keep everyone happy. All curry and tandoori dishes were great with Bharta being the highlight. Also enjoyed the kulfi at the end. Bonus point for handing out coloring books to kids! Will be going back!"}
{"text":"I went here on my friend's recommendation (plus he was driving so i dont think i was in a position to complain).  At first the name sounded like Tikka whorehouse....i was like \"where are we going?\".  I was not in the mood for pakistani/indian type of food so my mood going in was mildly subdued with less enthusiasm than that of my friends.  So we get there and out front is two vehicles that are purely from anywhere but here. There were tourists taking pictures in front of them with their children. It was those single motorbike with space for two passengers in a cart that you see in the movies.  This restaurant had a large outdoor section under a big decorative tent.  We however went to sit in the indoor section.  We ordered some grilled beef skewers, tandoori chicken, butter chicken and curry lamb.  Everything we ordered tasted succulent.  There was loud clubbing music at some point and alot of waiters/bussers running around.  When you enter this place you feel alive.  At the end of the meal, we had to go to the counter to pay with our receipt.  The meal was reasonable. Came to around $15 per person. On our way out, we decided to exit via the outdoor tent. Suddenly there was drumming and a few staff broke into chanting and dancing. We were privileged to witness a live musical performance.  The whole place was very festive. Definitely a place to go if you want to experience something different."}
{"text":"Had the green chicken as it sounded like something I have never had (marinated in yogurt, coriander, and mint). Was delicious and came with 8 solid thigh pieces that also had some sauteed onions, and green peppers. Had a plate of big plate of ric to share with my date who, as a vegetarian, had the channa (chick peas), and we also nabbed two garlic naans which were fantastic. I eat naan on the regular and this was proper and legit naan.  The decor of this place is good for casual eating or a nice warm special meal, especially when it is -15C outside!   It's a little strange to write the order on a whiteboard and have to bring it up to the desk when the waiters come by to give your food and also refill your water. Beyond that it's a guaranteed solid spot for quality food."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about eating at Lahore Tikka House, you'd better not be on a diet. And if you are, you'd better be ready to take a slight detour from said diet... this is not heart healthy food. But that being said, it is absolutely delicious!  When G and I first found out about LTH, we went back every three days. Twice on weekends. Seriously, this food was like a bad crack addiction. We couldn't get enough. My pants were busting at the seams begging me to stop but there were no interventions here.   We've tried several different items on the menu, from the chana masala (so good) to the matar paneer (so not good... the cheese was so shriveled and dried) to the vegetable platter and the biryani, but time and time again, we ALWAYS order the chicken tikka masala and the lamb kebabs. Always.  Yes, the food is covered in at least an inch of oil (dieters, you have already been warned!) and I do usually pour it out to one side (yes, POUR) and the picnicky plates and cutlery are kind of atrocious, but I will turn a blind eye as long as I can have my tastebud-enticing chicken tikka masala and the pure spicy goodness of the lamb kebabs. All wrapped in LTH's soft, chewy, delicious naan and a generous helping of fragrant basmati rice.   If you haven't been yet, you need to go now. Seriously, why are you still reading? GO!   I'm heading out the door as I type..."}
{"text":"Aah, Lahore, my lovely neighbour... really good authentic food and casual if somewhat chaotic atmosphere.  Agree with most of the other posters :)   Prices are getting a bit 'up there' though.    We live not too far down the street from them, and my neighbour has a running joke with her husband.  She wants him to finish a reno job, and he says he will get it done 'as soon as Lahore Tikka finishes theirs', LOL.  So far, he's had over five YEARS I believe, and she's pissed, ha ha ha.  Good spot though.  If you want cheaper or delivery, order from Makkah on the Danforth, or Chandni Chowk on Gerrard, they are both really good too.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Lahore Tikka House for the last 20 years, since it's very humble beginnings when they used disposable plates and had only a few tables. I remember this being our go-to spot, even if we had to drive 40 minutes. The original owner was friendly and made sure all the guests were taken care of by personally engaging with each table. I remember him fondly.   Needless to say, on our most recent visit to this restaurant, we had the most horrible experience. Though they have expanded in space, in hospitality, they have shrank - the food quality has significantly declined, and the customer service is appalling - especially from the owner herself, Gulshan.   We ordered our usual: beef seekh kebobs, chicken tikka boti, chicken biryani and naan. When the food arrived, we immediately noticed the skillets weren't sizzling as they usually did. It was as if cold, reheated kebobs and chicken pieces were placed on the skillets. Even the onions weren't sizzling; just thrown on top. We didn't point this out as we assumed they're busy, so it happens. The server had brought out the wrong order of naans. We had ordered 3 naans - 2 plain and 1 butter naan. He brought out 5 plain and 1 butter naan. We immediately notified him, and he went and changed it with 4 plain and 1 butter naan - which was still inaccurate. We let him know and he said \"it's okay, you can keep the extra naan\". Five minutes later, the owner walks over and instructs the same server to take the extra naan in front of us at our table. This is not only uncomfortable while we're eating, it's rude, unprofessional, and (lack of a better word) petty, especially when the server said something else five minutes prior. We ignore this and continue eating.   The main issue arises when not only are both the kebob and chicken dishes cold, the kebob tastes completely different from what we've had in all of our previous visits. Instead of being minced meat, it is chunks of meat and huge chunks of fat - completely inedible and disgusting. We call the server over to show him these pieces of low quality meat with fat pieces. He understands what we are saying and agrees with us based on examining the kebob himself. He then goes to the owner and explains the situation.   It's important to note she is maybe 5 feet away from us and we see all of this. She not only doesn't have the common courtesy to walk over and see the situation herself, she doesn't even slightly show any form of apologetic behaviour. The first rule of customer service is the customer is always right - anybody knows this - and most definitely someone in a management role should know this. The server comes back and takes the plate to her. She tells him to tell us it's \"herbs\" when clearly he has already agreed with us that it is large pieces of fat. We see her frolicking around, not once coming by us to say anything.   At a later point, the chef comes to speak to us. The thing here is, if you're the owner of an establishment, it is your duty to address the concerns of the guests, not send your staff over to deal with it. The chef was a very nice gentleman and saw the kebob and agreed that it was large pieces of fat and not meat. He was apologetic, as any person with basic customer service would be.   That being said, after this appalling experience we've had at Lahore Tikka House, we will never be returning. It's unfortunate and sad that the original owner's hard-work and vision for his restaurant is being tarnished by new management that lacks basic customer service skills, leadership, hospitality, and has a sour attitude."}
{"text":"Went here to eat today with some family members and when we first entered we were pretty excited. It's had some renovations and the dishes popping out we're looking good. I left most of the ordering to my brother and sister in-law while I watched my niece. A salad came out first that wasn't really touched but next came the butter chicken. If an Indian restaurant can't make butter chicken right then we have a problem. It was good but been there done that. Next came out a vegetarian dish with lentils. Wasn't bad and out came our plain rice. Oh and plain naan and garlic naan.  The food was ok and overall everyone seemed content with the portion. Just shy of being comfortably full. The wait staff is very nice and water is going around regularly. They did forget to bring out one dish that we were anticipating the most. A sizzling beef dish but it never came out. Not a great meal and I probably won't return. The food is the same as almost any other Indian restaurant I've been to. This wasn't my brothers choice either. It was my sister in-laws and she was quite disappointed as well."}
{"text":"Awesome tasting food here. I would definitely recommend it if you are a fan of spicy food. However if you cannot handle spicy food then I would not recommend coming here as the choices for mild food are limited to two. One is the kids chicken and the other is something similar. Also do not go here if you are a vegetarian as that menu is limited too. The food is awesome and the service is fast that is once you get a seat. The waiters are plenty and get you that sizzling food pretty quickly depending on the amount of food you order. However they always tend to forget something that you have ordered, so make sure they have given you everything otherwise you will be charged for it. There are seats inside and outside, but the seats situated outside are cramped and not up to standards. I feel like I am in 2 star restaurant that provides 5 star food most of the time. They make tons of money but none of it is being invested in the infrastructure, which I think is a major shame as it can become bigger than it is now. Overall definitely visit this place if you love spicy meat dishes and you don't mind crowded noisy environment."}
{"text":"Lively, fun atmosphere with great food. I would suggest if you're not into spicy food then maybe stay away. I brought the kids here, and while the food was super delicious, and I love spicy food, the kids struggled with it a little bit. Mind you, I didn't really ask for what the non-spicy items were. Overall a fantastic meal though!"}
{"text":"As has been ably described by other reviewers, Lahore Tikka is an experience. It's huge, usually bustling, and chock full of colours, textures, and noises. The night we were there someone had a birthday and a bunch of staff came out and sang a song while beating on some kind of drum.  The service was far better than I expected. There were about a zillion people working (all in snappy lahore tikka tshirts) to accommodate the full house of customers. To order: sit down at a table, read the menu, tick off which items you would like, then take your completed menu up to the cash. They'll give you a number which you will then display on your table so a server can find you when your food is ready. Drinks are ordered from a server at your table.  The food was really quite tasty, but hella greasy. Pools of grease remained in each dish (except the fish pilao). We were very excited by the tiny hot peppers (grilled and salted?! Delish!) they brought us. A must try if you like spice.  All of that plus the not-so-cheap price tag and I'll be back, but probably only when friends are visiting the 'hood. The ambiance is worth a bit of grease and extra cash, but not every day. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"When I first arrived at the restaurant, I was asking myself if I made a mistake, this place is essentially two mobile trailers attached to a house. First you get seated on a plastic lawn chair at a foldable table. Then you get served with plastic cutlery, styrofoam cups and styrofoam plates. Then you have the fabric ornaments on the wall with Christmas lights on the ceiling. I felt like I was at a frat house Christmas party. If you can look pass all that, be prepared to be wowed by the food. As two of my friends were Indian (they claim Pakistani food and Indian food is really similar) I left it up to them to order.    We had: Lahori Lamb kabobs - the best dish by far, very flavourful and great with garlic naan.  Lahori Chicken kabobs - very good, tender and juicy kabobs. Muttar (peas) Paneer - The highlight of this dish was the paneer, fried just right, bite into the paneer and you'll get a flavourful taste of cheese. Biryani rice with chicken tikka - a fried rice dish that comes on a hot sizzling plate. Liked it, but I've had better chicken tikka before. Butter chicken - was ok, just had too much grease for my liking. Samosas - disappointing, they were not crispy and had too much dough.  All the dishes had the right amount of spice to give it a nice kick, nothing was overly spicy, so your tastebuds can rejoice! I agree with the other reviewers that the staff are friendly and were happy to answer your questions. One thing to note is that they seem to be near completion of their two storey restaurant right next door. Which fortunately does not have a frat house feel to it. My 4 stars is for the food and not to be included for the surroundings.  Be sure to walk east along Gerrard street for some sweet paan after your meal, I counted 5 paan houses within 100 metres and all of them still open pass 12AM on a Friday night. Paan is basically different kinds of spices, coconut, and dried fruits, rolled up in a betel leaf, meant to be a snack and sometimes a digestif(I think?) or in our case a breath freshener. As one of my friends described it, it was like eating a air freshener. You'll need it after the spice filled meal!"}
{"text":"This is a PAKISTANI restaurant people, Lahore is the capital of one of the provinces in Pakistan. Indian food tastes dull, has no meat in it and is usually quite tasteless. This is what Pakistani food tastes like. Kebabs, Naans, Lamb and Karahi Woks are a Pakistani thing.  Anyway, personally since I'm a Born and bred Lahori, their food is Horrible and a disgrace to the famous Lahori taste. I only eat here when I forget how horrible the food is here."}
{"text":"very delicious one of the best south asian places in the city. we ordered a lot of the popular dishes:   Butter chicken - great it's heavy on the masala and it is not as sweet as other butter chicken dishes I've had to be honest it wasn't my favourite and I normally love butter chicken    beef and lamb kababs - delicious but I couldn't tell the difference between the lamb and the beef could be improved by allowing the natural meat flavour to come through  beef ribs- good but again heavy on the masala  Haleem beef- I found this disgusting to be honest it looks so unappetizing and I couldn't get over that (looked like diarrhea) it was very slimy. Others in my group really enjoyed it.   Gol Gappay - must get app. honestly the best thing we ordered it was cool and refreshing  both the regular chai and the kashmiri chai were knockouts omg if you have a change get the  kashmiri chai!!!!! also get the Kulfi the stick in the middle was annoying but the flavour regardless if u get the original, pistachio or mango its all good!!!   The food was great! I would give 5 stars but the service was bad, we had to wave the servers down and most of the time they never came by. we were also far in the corner so that probably didn't help things. maybe if you go on a weekday the service would be better, since it wont be that busy."}
{"text":"Glad to say this place is still as fine as it was years ago.  Excellent Chicken kebabs and bread along with the usual Pakistani/Indian fair."}
{"text":"This place is great. It was my first experience trying Pakistani/Indian food and sure, I've had the occasional naan here and there but their garlic naan is just pure bliss. It puts you in a different zone when you eat this. Seriously.  I tried a few other dishes but honestly, my friend did all the ordering and I did all the eating. Everything was delicious! Another noteworthy mention is the ambience. They had beautiful saris and other decorations covering their walls and when I went today (on a Thursday), it was quite busy around 7pm.  By the way, try the mango lassi drink - not too bad. Only complaint is that it was room temperature whereas I prefer a cooled drink but that could be the way it's served, who knows."}
{"text":"Love this place! VERY AUTHENTIC! Went here for a birthday and the food was out of this world. The flavours are rich and complex and the food is spicy!! The samosas were great as was the Chicken Tikki Biriyani, chicken kababs and naan. So much food! We went in the summer under the white tent and it was a full party experience - really a fun time! The prices were on-par with the servings."}
{"text":"I never complain about restaurants and let things go but I have never been so disrespected in my entire life by an owner of a restaurant. Never go to Lahore Tikka House folks! The owner is extremely rude and disrespectful.  Here's a note I wrote to them detailing my awful experience:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear Lahore Tikka House,  Today my family and I experienced something that we have never experienced ever in our lives being customers at a restaurant.   To say that me and my family were disrespected would be an understatement.   The most shocking thing is, is that out of all the people whom we were disrespected by was none another than your owner Gulshan!  We understood the fact that you had a sign outside your store saying that strollers cannot be in the restaurant due to high traffic.  At the same time, my daughter had fallen asleep in the stroller and we could not take her out of the stroller otherwise she would have woken up and she had just fallen asleep after a very long day. By the way, the way Gulshan was during this process in explaining it to us was extremely rude and disrespectful. But it gets better...  So my family had sat at the table that the hostess and brought us to and my wife and I had sat outside in the corner where there was a small table with two chairs with our daughter in her stroller just so we can co-operate and not be difficult customers.  So we told one of the hostesses that we'll sit here and when the food comes to our family's table, my wife and I will grab the food from the table where our family is sitting and come back to the table we were sitting on just so we don't leave our daughter alone in the stroller.  Gulshan over heard that and she told the hostess that my wife and I are not allowed to eat at that small table and she will not serve our family if we eat there. I politely asked for an explanation and she did not provide one and just walked away. Again, her tone of voice is very rude and disrespectful.   My wife and I were sitting far away from the main tables just so the stroller was not in anybody's way and we were accommodating ourselves just so we do not bother anybody but at the same time we needed a place to eat as well. But Gulshan was not allowing us to do so and was not willing to help us out at all. We were out all day enjoying the day with our family and were very hungry. The choice was between one restaurant and your restaurant, we chose yours.  Anyways, the food came and my wife and I grabbed some food from our family's table and walked back to our table and began eating. The hostess for whatever reason told Gulshan we were eating, Gulshan came over to our table, and said we have to remove this table and pulled the table away from us with one of the waiters. Now my wife and I are sitting there eating with no table. So we eventually grabbed two more chairs and put our plates on the chairs and finished our meal.  Gulshan is a very rude, disrespectful, and an unprofessional owner who needs to disappear. I hope somehow she leaves her position and never comes back.  She was being very direct, short, and yelled at us at time as well.   Your food was always tasteless but my family really wanted to go. Now we have a second reason not to go. I will make sure none of my family members nor my friends ever come back to your Lahore Tikka House ever again.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Hit and Miss but mostly a miss. We went for a lunch with family today and ordered a number of dishes including beef kabobs, chicken tikka and vegetarian sizzler. Unfortunately the dishes were per cooked and not fresh. So here is a tip - if the food is not sizzling hot, it is not fresh and suggest to send it back and have them make it fresh."}
{"text":"Go here for the Nihari. It is out of this world. Just incredible.   As for the rest of the menu, it's good, but I've had equally good or better elsewhere. If you know Indian/Pakistani food, you will be satisfied, but not blown away.   That Nihari though...  My little secret: put it over some Lamb Biryani and be prepared to have your world turned upside down. Mind-bendingly good."}
{"text":"Stunning authentic Indian food. Had the chicken tikka masala-a staple, and it was excellent!"}
{"text":"The only thing that had a reasonable meat in it was the beef but it basically was tiny diced down low quality meat. The butter chicken was more like butter bones. The six or seven dollar chicken tikka was four pieces of fatty chicken. It was as lean as a sumo fighter. The paneer was basically a PEA-NEER with roughly two or three bland pieces of cheese thrown in. The naan was alright but I've had much better. The rice was wet, starchy, and crappy. The only thing that was decent about this place was the quick service. It lives on its fast reputation but is a shell of its former self."}
{"text":"Best Pakistani food ever! I come here every time I am in town. I would definitely recommend the lamb Karahi."}
{"text":"If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would but there's no option for it.  The atmosphere is casual and fun. It seems authentic based on the diversity of the customers. And it was packed from the time we arrived to the time we left.  The food was good value but not the best quality. The lamb biryani was awesome. The beef short ribs was \"ok\" but seemed to have a weird powdery texture to it. The Palak & Daal (spinach & lentils) was good. The presentation of the meat dishes was fun because they came out on a sizzling platter! The butter chicken was different than what I was used to (maybe because of a difference in regions) so I would try something else next time.  The service was fantastic. We didn't have to ask for water and they brought out a pitcher of water and cups for us. Servers checked in on us to make sure we were ok too!  Yes - you write your order on a mini-whiteboard and bring it up to the cash. I think it's ridiculous that some of the yelpers post lengthy rants about it. Get over it. The format isn't ridiculous and is used at other places too. Also, they use plastic cups now to serve water.  My group of 4 paid $20 per person and were stuffed. We tried 2 kebabs, 2 meat dishes, 1 veggie dish, 1 rice dish and 2 pieces of naan.  All in all, we had a great time and we are open to try it again in the next few months."}
{"text":"Having read good reviews on Yelp and on friend's recommendation, we went to LTH on Friday April 6th,2016.  This place was quite busy and we were lucky enough to be seated within 15 minutes. The typical wait times can be much longer though. We ordered the Veg mix platter and Kabobs with rice and both of them were quite delicious. The quantity was good enough for 2 persons.  We were greeted properly upon entering and while exiting after the meal. We will surely visit this place again in the new few months to try out other items on the menu.  I HIGHLY recommend this place for excellent Pakistani/Indian food. You will LOVE it."}
{"text":"Good ambiance. Long wait and ok food. Taste was pretty stand on almost every thing what we ordered."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars as much for it's decor -and I use the term ironically- as it does for it's food. There is a majestic, beautiful, and semi-completed building on site but that's not where you eat.  You eat in crowded portables at rickety tables with paper plates and water cups which I suspect the kitchen staff purposely dent so they fall over as soon as you fill them with water. Hilarious!  The must-see place is the bathroom. At least the ladies' room. Take a thrilllng walk through the kitchen, smile at the fellas slaving over the tandoori oven, take care not to trip on uneven floor tiles, and after a fashion you end up in an embassy bathroom. Mums, take note: spanking clean change tables WITH TV so the babes can be distracted while you clean.  The food? Good. Greasy. Smoky. Heavy on sauce and light on portions, especially for meat. The first thing you will be given is a wilted lettuce leaf and a depressed slice of onion. Don't eat it. Don't run away. They are tricking you. The food that comes after is quite good but the \"salad\" is used as a device here, that's all.  Don't get the samosas. Go across to Moti Mahal for those, and please check your bill each and every time. There is almost always an error, and strangely, not likely to be in your favour.  I could go on for hours but the upshot of this place is that the thrill in the location, not the food Go elsewhere if you are doing takeout."}
{"text":"I would give it 4 stars for the food but due to the note below I had to take it down to 3.   Went there for dinner tonight based on all the Yelp reviews.  we sat outside as it was another gorgeous night.  The decor is as everyone described it: TACKY and STRANGE. The food was really good.  Here is what we had and what we thought of the meals:  From the \"HEFTY RICE SIZZLERS\"  section:  Two Chicken Kebab/Chicken Tikka Rice $12.50 - REALLY GOOD!!! Comes on a huge bed of rice with veggies and the meat.  From the \"LAHORI KAHARI\" section:  Karahi Chicken:  REALLY REALLY Greasy!! in a small iron skillet, I would pass on this next time and just order another Rice Sizzler or something less oily.  We also has a Garlic and Plain Naan bread, which was of course really good.  All in all we found the service to be nice and helpful.  As an important aside:  *****Here is what bothered us the MOST:  It is truly unbelievable that a dine-in restaurant would use STYROFOAM PLATES, CUPS and PLASTIC CUTLERY!!!!!!!!  People please......it is 2012, let's have some respect for the planet we all call home.    We were appalled at the staff just literally filling garbage bags full of STYROFOAM!   This stuff is being banned in California.  Canada should wake up and ban it also!!!!!    How about real dishes and cutlery?  What a concept!"}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant with excellent food! We had the kebobs, biryani, butter chicken, and garlic naan. We left very full and satisfied with a new favorite Indian restaurant! Compared to the Indian food in Markham we really enjoyed the food and is a clear difference compared to the all you can eat restaurants. Note, the hot peppers here are complimentary and extremely spicy!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a few years and am always satisfied. Their naan is always fresh, and the butter chicken is to die for. The only thing that has changed recently is they no longer make their mango lassi to order. They make it in massive batches and put ice to keep it cool but this waters it down and it isn't so good anymore. The service is usually good depends on who you get for a waiter. They are attentive and polite. The bathrooms were surprisingly well maintained (womens bathroom) which was kind of a shock seeing as how many people were in the restaurant.  Its a very casual place they serve the food on paper plates and use plastic utensils but the food is better than any food I have had in a fine dining restaurant thats for sure"}
{"text":"I ordered the following:  plain/butter nan: fresh as expected.    Lamb kabobs: you have to order a minimum of two pieces ($2.79 each).  I ordered two and they were smaller than expected.  But they were really tasty.  The order comes with a small salad on the plate.  Chicken Tikka Masala: served in a really hot pan that came straight from an oven.  This was really tasty, the chicken was boneless.  This is a pretty small portion of meat for $13~.  Vegetable Samosa: These were just so-so, nothing special here.  $1 a piece.  Mango Lassi: good.  Overall,. the food was pretty good.  Its a  bit expensive.  The ordering process is a bit different.  You are seated by a waiter, and they start you off with a salad plate.  Then you go up to the counter and order.  They give you a number stand which you bring back to your table.  The food comes out, and there is 'sort of' a waiter.  I'm still not sure.  To pay, you go up to the cash after you are done your meal.   Also, they only use disposable (styrofoam/plastic) plates/utensils."}
{"text":"Gerrard is a dump and so is this supposed Tikka House. Over spiced Kebobs and inflated prices make this parking lot they call a restaurant unbearable. The food is not authentic, without the book store next door this place would have closed shop long ago.....Halal patrons flock from that store to here!  Heres an idea, how about proper tables, chairs and the typical restaurant setup one has become accustomed to at these outrageous prices, nope not here. Just ghetto Indian furnishings and a cult following that keeps this place alive. I've had and will have better, so next time i'll save the time from going downtown for sub par food."}
{"text":"If you are going here for the food, I highly recommend it.  We had the chicken tikka masala, lamb biryani, and garlic naan and it was amazing.  Don't get the kulfi.  The service was absolutely horrible.  My boyfriend and I were being served by male waiters, and not a single one of them would look at me or any other woman for that fact.  They came over to ask how the food was and pretty much asked my boyfriend without looking my direction.  When they took our order, they asked my boyfriend what \"we\" were having.  They are either new to the country and used to their home country, or just plain sexist.    The decor could be much better considering how popular they seem to be.  I assume they get good business, so the styrofoam plates and cups could go in the garbage permanently in exchange for some silverware and glass plates."}
{"text":"Ate at the Tikka House tonight and I have to say, mixed reviews on a few items.  The dish items werent great, the butter chicken and aloo paneer were mediocre at best but damn you gotta try the kebabs!  We ordered like a few lamb and chicken kebabs and they come on this sizzling hot plate, they were amazing!  A bit spicy for this white boy but its okay every once in a while.  Highly recommended to try.  The ordering system was a little weird, you have to order and pay at the front cashier but it sucks because this was a huge line and only one cashier for such a massive restaurant, but still yo, all in all a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Kebabs with Garlic naan are to die for.    Be sure to end every meal with a kulfi.  Sit outside on the awesome inclined patio in the summer.  Not as good as it used to be 10 years ago, but still one of the best."}
{"text":"Lahore Tikka House SUCKS. I completely \"get\" why people still love this place. Its been under renovation for at least six years. The moment you sit, you are swarmed by Pakistani men with light eyes offering you pink Kashmiri tea. The bathrooms are palatial and heck there are TUK TUKS out front. Its all \"on the other side of town\" and \"unique\" I understand, but the food itself.. not so good.   Basically EVERYTHING is doused in oil. It is the most oily food I have ever eaten, not that spicy and it is truly lacking any love. Everything is served in Styrofoam with plastic cutlery and the indoor seating feels very \"portable-esque\" or \"cheap RV-esque\" even. Its pretty bad. You sit on outdoor plastic tables inside or out and everything is disposable including glassware.   The \"vegetarian platter\" looks like kitchen scraps on a sizzling plate swimming in oil. Its deplorable. Awful. The Saag is so oily its almost amazing. The meat dishes (say my dining companions) are better, but still unremarkable.   You should pay cash, the one time I tried VISA they rang it through twice (surprise! when i got my statement) and I had to get VISA to reverse. I assume its a mistake but still.   FULL star for the tuk tuk photo ops and the delicious Kulfi (get it to go)  No booze on premises which is a shame because of the patio and because drunk and Tuk Tuks is twice the fun."}
{"text":"This is a JOKE!.  1. This place has nice rickshaws outside along with tents to give \" appearance\" of authentic Pakistani food ... Beware food subpar  2. I ordered nihari and chicken tikka.. It was poorly made ..  3. If you re looking for Pakistani style food .. Don't come here .. Even the severs agreed .."}
{"text":"This is the best Pakistani restaurant in Toronto, bar none.  Authentic Lahori Pakistani food.  Luckily I don't live too closeby, otherwise I would be putting on some serious weight.    Anything from the grill is delicious here - the seekh kebabs, the chicken tikka, the boneless chicken, the tandoori chicken - these are grilled to perfection.  And the best part is when they come to your table they SIZZLE.  You can't get that sizzle anywhere else.  They are brought to you on cast iron grill plates, with onions, peppers and delectable spices.    The curries are also good, as are the biryanis.  But the BBQ is what this place is known for.  I would also recommend a Lahori Kulfi for dessert, this place makes their own kulfi and it is wonderful.  Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for authentic Pakistani BBQ."}
{"text":"It doesn't have the same quality it had before. Portions are smaller, service isn't good and the price to accompany it all does not match the overall experience. My hypothesis is that the service and quantity were lowered as a result of such a large initial customer base, that the owners thought they could cut a few aspects of the experience down overtime and no one would see the difference.   Three people including me used to go and by the end we would have so much food left over that we could pack for the next day. We ordered the tandoori chicken breast, sizzling beef ribs and the combo veggie sizzler to top it all off... Not to mention about 5 naan breads thinking there would be so much to use it with. In the end we ended up filling ourselves with the naan. The beef ribs were improperly cooked and rubbery. It looked like they used half a piece of breast of chicken. The only thing that was proportionate was the veggie combo sizzler (but of course because there isn't any meat to cheap out on).   As soon as we stepped in there were employees fixing the front door which not only restricted the entry to one door, but intermittently restricted both altogether. We waited about 5 minutes outside in the cold before going in as a result of a ladder in the way. When we sat down it took the waiters 15 mins to come take the order. However I do appreciate the fact that it was a holiday and they were busier than usual so I let that go. The food came shortly following the order which was very good. However, while we were attempting to bite into the dense ribs the waiters came and asked us if we were okay 12 times... Yes I counted. When we were done the main course however (which didn't take long) it took them 15 minutes to come and find out why we were sitting at a table with no food on it. Of course that could only mean two things: we were ready for the check or we wanted to order more. Instead, as we were getting up to pay at the front desk they approached us. I simply took a mango Laasi to go, however I finished it while waiting in the \"payment\" line at the front desk.   This restaurant used to be a favourite of ours but we have unanimously decided that today was the last time we were going there. The amount of money we paid didn't match the quality at all... The one thing that really threw me off however on a personal note is that their sole dishware were disposable plastics and Styrofoam plates and cups. Sorry but I am not coming to a restaurant that can not handle being green and using a reusable method of serving food. I've been to restaurants cheaper than here (we spent 60 dollars altogether) that have at least the basics: glass/ceramic dishware that doesn't rip upon contact of a plastic knife trying to cut through rubbery beef ribs."}
{"text":"It is super authentic, and you can smell this place 10 yards away!! lol!! (so... DO NOT wear fancy clothes if you were to eat there)   Food is great. The butter chicken is super awesome, not so sweet and very buttery, definitely the best I've ever had, make sure to order extra spicy! The place has always been busy, so be ready if you are told to wait 45mins+.   The only downside of this place is to make sure not to order takeouts. The last time i ordered tikka malasa for takeout, they only gave half the size they serve in dine."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place and even though it was packed on last Friday night with a lot of people waiting in queue - they were able to accommodate me and found me a single table.  Food was great and I had Beef Kebabs and Lamb Karahi.  Both of these dishes were great and I topped it off with a kulfi and green tea.  Green tea itself was colder than I like and was warm at the best.  Overall a great experience and will return when I am in town."}
{"text":"Quite the experience.  This place use to be a tiny old shack that probably should have been condemned, but now its more of a mansion than a house. What has brought me back several times over the years as they have upgraded their surroundings is the food.  Simply incredible Pakistani/Indian. While a little on the oily side the flavour can't be beat. The butter chicken sauce is so delicious you will be mopping up ever last drop with the home made naan.  The only reason this place loses a star is because it completely lacks any organization and there are still several structural aspects of the place that make me question my safety while dining there. Despite this it still remains my go to spot. I just wish they delivered to my area."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I feel like I'm an honorary member of Pakistani family when I'm there.    It's a great place to go with a big group as it's casual and can handle disorganization.  Great for a summer day, the outdoor patio is welcoming.   The food was great and very well priced.  The kabab's were the obvious winner of the dishes, in particular the lamb kabobs.  The butter chicken was your average fare.      Among the vegetarian dishes, we tried the saag paneer, which was good but greasy, and the muter paneer, which was tasty but too heavy on the green peas.  The \"special\" tea was something to beware.  The pink concoction seemed sour, and watching them making the tea in the huge barrels on my way out made be lose my appetite a bit. Maybe it's an acquired taste.  Overall, a definite staple to add to your list authentic pakistani/indian food."}
{"text":"I don't know why there is so much hype about this restaurant. Both the times I went I was disappointed - the first time was in Spring, it was cold outside and they were doing construction. There was no heat and it was a bad experience. Second time, went there for my mother's birthday - the food was terrible. I am pretty sure they  heated the lamb shanks using a microwave - most of the meat was not fresh. Everyone in the family was sick for few days after eating here. Save your money - don't go here!!"}
{"text":"What a dump! What disgraceful decor! And the service... you have to stand in a big line-up for take out and none of the servers ever have time for you for sit-down dining!  Who cares? The food is as good as it gets. Try the buttered chicken if you really, really love yourself. Share it if you have some love left over for your friends and family."}
{"text":"Craziness! I read alot of great reviews on this place, so, I decide to try it. For the first time, when I saw the \"shed\", i walk up slowly, and I'll admit, I turned around and walk out. If the waiter didn't stop and greet me, I probably wouldn't have tried this place. :-(  The service was great! All the waiters are very friendly and helpful. Food is SO GOOD! So tasty! We had pretty much tried most items on the menu. Kebobs are a must-try. Juicy and tender. The vegetable combo platter was excellent. And, I was never disappointed with any of their dishes except for the mango lassi. It tasted water-down.   It's not really cheap consider the fact that you are eating off styrofoam plates and plastic forks. But it's worth it! We usually paid about $25 per person...granted, we usually have leftovers."}
{"text":"The best, most delicious butter chicken in the city. I highly reccomend Lahore Tikka-House, there is a great atmosphere and the staff is very friendly.   The place is very large and can get packed on weekends!   I often get takeout from them."}
{"text":"Muttar paneer here is the best in the city and so is the garlic naan.  It has hiked in price considerably over the past 5 years or so (I guess to pay for the long-running renos) but I still love the food.  Service is always friendly.  We went last week and there is now more space to park at the side, brilliant!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Also really family-friendly with a nursing staff room in back. -1 star for Styrofoam plates and plastic cutlery. The food and service is so good though!"}
{"text":"The kebobs are to die for so is their butter chicken and rice. I try to try something new everytime I go there. Very extensive menu lots to choose from. Can be very loud at times but that's a good sign."}
{"text":"Third time coming here and finally I am doing a review! Clearly the third time is a charm. Love the freshly made naan that is from an actual tandoor over which can be seen during the summer months as they make your naan practically beside the tables if you're in the tent.   Additional shout out to the Karahi chicken and the kabobs which are fantastic. the veggie platter mix is a great deal though it is heavy on the chick peas and skimpy on the aloo =/ Best part is that the dishes are all served on sizzling skillets guaranteeing that they will be piping hot!  Really good prices for a group dinner though I don't think i could justify going there with any less than 3 people as the portions are fairly large.   A must try is their kashmir chai which unfortunately doesn't come lactose free but is worth the pain for those of us who are sensitive or completely intolerant. Bonus is that it comes pink from the saffron flowers and they add sugar, almonds, and pistachios if you'd like.  Best non food experience is the atmosphere which is described by a Punjabi friend of mine as reminiscent of an Indian wedding! Plus the music is an interesting fusion of Indian and several year old pop hits."}
{"text":"It's such a waste of money no taste all food item just throw in garbage."}
{"text":"Lahore TIkka House has an identity crisis, by Toronto standards. Is it a take out place with a large seating area, or a terrible sit-down restaurant? The result is confounded expectations and unnecessary disappointment. The tables are set upon arrival, and there are plenty of staff who take drink orders and bring food to your table. So why not decide to be a restaurant and have waiters and bus boys instead of an army of the latter?  Despite the identity crisis, if the food had been good, it would have made up for the ambiance. It was not. Oily only begins to describe every dish I tried: the vegetarian \"sizzler\" platter, dal, palak chicken, lamb kabob, and biriyani. The lamb kabob even had the distinction of being both dry and oily.  Overall, a number of problems added up to an unpleasant experience: tiny styrofoam cups of water, some dishes arriving on smoking, stinking platters, uniformity of flavours, slippery floors, all plastic cutlery, tables, and chairs.  I've been to a lot of Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi restaurants in Toronto and the GTA, but I'm not as familiar with the offerings in the east end. Maybe this is one of the best choices in the East, but for the city overall, avoid this one like the plague."}
{"text":"Went there with family.  Food was ok but bit spicy. Taste was not authentic.   Ordering food is very unusual for a restaurant of this style. You have to take your order to main desk yourself  The management of seats is subpar. We were placed next to a door and everyone was hitting our seats going through the door. When asked to be seated somewhere else the request was denied for unclear reasons.   Mango lassi is good but I would recommend salty lassi as its more authentic   All had stomach upset after eating here"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto. Whileacking in visual appeal, and serving on disposal plates, the food is amazing.  The kebobs with rice, butter chicken or red snapper are all favourites..."}
{"text":"What is there to say about Lahore Tikka House that hasn't been said?  It's a Toronto cult favourite, and for good reason. Lahore Tikka House has that homey feeling that makes you feel instantly at home. The food is so authentic, so adventurous, and so brimming with flavour that it'll make you want to go back within seconds of leaving the place. It's the kind of place you want to tell all of your friends about. It's the kind of place that doesn't mess around pretending to be something that it's not.  One of my friends once told me that it's not the nicest restaurant, but I'd beg to disagree - it's just not very modern-looking or 'downtown chic,' but it has its own ambiance that reminds you you're at an authentic Indian restaurant, and yes you're going to leave very, very satisfied.  My go-tos: -Their butter chicken (!!!) -Their chicken tikka masala -Garlic naan"}
{"text":"Well, this place is fantastic. The reviews that are negative are all for weird reasons...I don't like the plates? the building is under construction? Who cares. The place is wild looking, and yes under construction, and yes, styrofoam plates. But the flavors are all you could want and more. I especially recommend the Afghan Chicken Tikka. The spinach is spicy and good. The kabobs both chicken and beef were wonderful. Go down near the kitchen and watch them make nan--very cool. This place is the real deal. If you want fancy, go elsewhere, but if you are a serious foodie, this place is for you."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about the place, and went there with a lot of expectations. I ordered Palak Chicken, Garlic Naan, Lahori Kulfi and Kashmiri Chai - none of which made me feel they were worth the time/drive/money. The food wasn't bad per se, but nothing to write home about either. I am sticking to the stuff I ordered becuase they had a pretty diverse menu and it's highly likely that they might excel in some other dishes."}
{"text":"I am from Lahore and anybody who has been to or is from Pakistan knows that Lahori's are very passionate about their food. Hell, food is all they think/talk about. The name of this restaurant is very misleading. One thinks that he is visiting am authentic lahori restaurant but in reality is actually visiting the worst Pakistani restaurant in Toronto. For people who are looking to try the authentic Lahori food. Please do not eat here."}
{"text":"Lahore is vibrant, upbeat, fun and exotic.  I can't remember the last time I had this much fun at a restaurant.  Everywhere I turned, I saw people having fun, laughing with their friends and family.  This is the kind of place I love.   You know what else I love about this place?  I love that it made me forget I was in Toronto.  Instead, I felt like I was at a big party, a celebration of good food, in a large simple hut somewhere in Asia.   I also liked the ordering system.  Once you are seated, they give you a one page menu, then you walk up to a cashier and tell the staff what you want.  They'll hand you an assign number which you place it on your table.  You go back to the cash register station and pay after you've eaten.  The food came out hot and fast.  The first dish came to our table in less than 5 minutes.  It was that fast.  We saw a hot sizzling plate of Lahori Beef Kabab on the table next to ours and had to order it.  OMG, what a good start!  The Kabab was tasty and well seasoned.  All I wanted to do was wrap the garlic naan around the kabab and eat it like a hot dog.  The garlic naan was absolutely divine!  Just imagine fresh hot naan with a garlic-pesto-like spread all over it!  Aloo Gobi was zesty.  I generally don't care for cauliflower.  But let me tell you, I never knew cauliflower could taste this good!  Chana Masala was \"get down, get down\" good!  Spicy and delicious.  One of my favorite Chana Masala dishes in town.  If you want a fancy, romantic and fine dinning experience, you should head to Yorkville.  Don't come here.  But if you want to hang out in a fun place with Bollywood vibe and share a good Pakistan/Punjabi food with a large group of close friends and family in an \"exotic\" setting, I highly recommend the Lahore.  Tips:  Leave your Burberry, Gucci, Prada attire at home.  Wear something you don't mind throwing in a washer afterwards.  Yeah, you are going to smell like Lahore.  But you wouldn't care, because you are going to feel so happy leaving that place."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Visiting town from California and loved the karahi naan. Biryani waa oily for my taste so one star less, kulfi reminded me of pakistan. Keep up the good work guys and loved the decor, music. Thanks. :)"}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo/Niagara and make frequent trips to Canada to visit friends and go on foodie missions. I was first introduced to Lahore Tikka House on Gerrard about 7 years ago. Since then, on every visit we do not leave Toronto without eating at Lahore or at least bringing piles of take out for home back over the border.  After my experience yesterday, I have concluded that I need to write this review.  Lets have a little history: In my beginnings there, before renovations, you sat in a trailer or on the pavement patio. I don't mind the plastic tables or styrofoam plates and plastic cutlery, to me it only adds to the experience. The food always tasted great, and for the value there was plenty to share for the table.   Forward a couple of years to the start of the never-ending reno's. Prices increased steadily. Service got worse. And MOST IMPORTANTLY, this is where they get you: 2 OUT OF EVERY 3 TIMES THEY ADD ITEMS TO YOUR BILL THAT YOU NEVER ORDERED! You have to be VERY CAREFUL here, they try to be very sneaky, you MUST LOOK at your detailed bill BEFORE you pay. Last night this happened once again not only to me but the party that was with me. SHAME ON A BUSINESS running with these tactics!! It is always so crowded in there and so disorganized I'm sure so many people get ripped off without even knowing it.  Present: Last night for me was the last straw and the last time going out of my way to get Paki food. WHY IS NO ONE EVER COMPLAINING HERE ABOUT THE DRASTICALLY INCREASED PRICES? The menu posted here is from about 2009. Right now, BUTTER CHICKEN is up to $12.25! That much for the same FIVE pieces of tikka with sauce that used to be $7.95. I understand inflation but these increases are outrageous for what you get. A small plate of plain rice, almost $4.00? Bringing your dinner of one butter chicken, rice, and maybe a naan to around $20? Everything on the menu has increased so much and the portions are same or even smaller, less paneer in the palak, etc. I guess if you have not been a long-time customer you won't notice these things but trust me it is NOT like it used to be. Everything is covered in grease and all has the same taste now, like they use the same spice for ALL dishes. There are no distinguishable flavors any more. And the smell? You will reek like a tandoori when you leave there until you take your clothes off and wash them, and shower/wash your hair with real hot water...  The disorganization was like a three ring circus with the new setup. Where to order, where to pay, watching the waiters and their facial expressions of frustration was my entertainment for the evening. I was even offered seating in the \"basement\" because it was so crowded. What?? Never heard that one before. We ended up with a table right near the door, the end of it was empty so when people came in and were waiting for a seat they sat on the edge and/or let their children stand all over it while we were trying to enjoy this overpriced greasy mess. How classy.  With the amount of business this place gets, people will still flock there and pay these prices and they will keep raising the prices as long as they can get away with it. Currently for the cost of the butter chicken, tawa queema, curries, etc, they SHOULD GIVE PLAIN RICE with it at least! Charge extra for extra rice but come on....  Last time for me, Lahore... last time.... and this makes me sad."}
{"text":"I'd like start by saying I love Pakistani and Indian cuisine and my back ground is from  Pakistan.  I went to Lahore tikka and before I even saw the menu could not believe the lack of effort by the owners as far as Decor..... Everybody sits on plastic patio furniture horrible.... they use styrofoam cups in 2013 which are disgusting for the environment and just as bad for people that drink from them.... For the amount they charge for the food it should be out of this world... again it's mediocre to good... It's obvious the owners only care for the profit and are not interested giving the patron a nice environment with stainless steel cutlery and not plastic.... Anybody that supports this place either doesn't know any better or just likes to give their hard earned cash to people that truly do not care. Check out Gautama on gerrard and you'll see what I mean, attention to detail and a world appart from that dive Lahore tikka!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Canada from the U.S. I eat here at least once, but never again will I be visiting this place. The water tasted like dishwater water and the food was average, which earns it the one star rating. The staff and owner however, provided me with the worst customer service I have ever received by anyone. I have never been so disrespected in my life. Me and my family were a party of 10. Without us knowing we were overcharged by $130. Before we realized this had happened we already paid and when we asked for our money back they said it was nonrefundable. When the staff wasn't cooperating with me and my family we asked to speak to the owner or manager. The owner came to us and before we could explain to her what the problem was she was yelling in our faces and refused to solve the issue. As someone who works in a family owned business never in a billion years would I have treated my customers the way the owner and staff had treated me and my family. We waited a week and visited three times (even though the restaurant was 2 hours away) asking for them to check the cameras or check the tills. They just refused and yelled at all of us to the point where we had to leave because they were causing a scene. Overall this place is not customer friendly and I will never be visiting again."}

You'd be surprised by how hard it is to find someone who's adventurous enough to try new things AND doesn't have any deathly allergies.  Anyways, so when I heard that there was a twitup happening at Lahore Tikka House- I jumped on the train to check out Lahore Tikka House that a lot of people recommended to me. I first discovered Gerrald East when driving by for work and realized it was unofficial Little India! How cool is that we have different parts in the city with such heavy cultural influences?  When I arrived at Lahore Tikka House, it was nothing like what I expected. There were people sitting outside the restaurant and casually hanging out at the front, I felt like I was walking into someone's home. Inside of the restaurant was decorated with all these colorful patterns and fabrics.  Since there were many of us, we ordered all the food like family style and shared everything. While we were waiting for food, I realized I was sitting right infront of this area where they make the naan bread! The guy making all the naan bread saw me taking photos and called me over to the other side so I could get better photo of the process. He actally gave me free naan bread sprinkled with sugar! Yayyyy it was delish! :)  Ordered: Lahori Lamb Kabab  * 2.79 for each skewer  Ordered: Butter Chicken  * Bowl of butter chicken for $12.25  Ordered: Lamb Biryani  * Plate of lamb biryani for $11.25 * Biryani is a set of rice based foods made with spices, rice and meat * Think of this as their 'fried rice'  Ordered: Palak Paneer  * Plate of Palak Paneer for $8.99 * Fresh mashed up spinach with paneer cheese  I feel like I might have tried more dishes, but I seriously can not remember. Notice I didn't rate them out of 5 and I don't have much to comment about each dishes? That's because most of the dishes I was trying them for the first time and I didn't feel comfortable rating them with a number. But the lack of comments is mostly because.......they don't have AC in the restaurant!  Keeping in mind that this post is based on a personal experience- I found the restaurant to be way to hot, so hot that it made me feel uncomfortable. I was sweating throughout the entire meal and my makeup was melting off of my face. I couldn't tell what I was eating- whether I was eating it through my mouth or nose. The discomfort really got to me at one point I had to go for a walk mid-way through the meal.  I didn't give 1 out of 5 for the atmosphere because they had plastic doors, it's because of the temperature. I did enjoy the lamb biryani and lamb kabab but because of that one time experience of dining inside a sauna, I am scared to go back.  Sure, if you can stand the heat OR wait till the weather gets cooler that might be better option for you.  This post turned out more like a journal post than a review but that's how my dinner experience went down at Lahore Tikka House. It was nice meeting you but you are way too hot for me, goodbye.....probably forever."}
{"text":"How can Lahore Tikka House disappoint me? ... that was the question I asked myself when I visited this place earlier this year. I've always been a fan of LTH and have been spreading word about this restaurant since the day I discovered it first time in 2007.  Up until 2011, I used to go there quite regularly and did notice that the quality/taste was going down but thought maybe it was just that I had really high expectations. But no, guess I was wrong. The food has really gone down.  This year I found it to be a total disappointment. The biryani/chicken curries that used to light my taste bud don't really exist anymore. The only thing that is still good is the chicken kebab .. I won't drive down so far just for kebab I guess .. so no more of LTH now."}
{"text":"I've only been here once in the summer time. It was outdoor seating, but in a covered tent. The tables were wooden picnic style. This place was packed!!!   We ordered a couple of dishes and some naan. Overall it was good. I enjoyed the food, but I found that it was overpriced for what it was.   I would come here again of course, but it wouldn't be my first choice for indian food in this area."}
{"text":"I have known and visited this establishment for several years. At first, I was in bliss. The chicken tikka and butter till naan was amazing (and still is). Eating in a essentially a temporary trailer was forgivable, since construction on their new place next door was under way.  Fast forward 5 years. The new place is still under construction. Primary seating is still in those trailers. And for what I'm paying, I think they can at least provide better plastic cutlery and Styrofoam plating than what they are currently providing.   Having said all that, I still bring out of town friends to this place on occasion. The food is still great. But my love that I once had for this place has cooled off somewhat."}
{"text":"Really good food.   The service is frustrating. Then again, you dont tip, so its understandable"}
{"text":"This place is so ghetto looking but I heard I had to get the food so I came here for the food!  We ordered a few items but I was recommended by some legit Indian foodies to stick to the tandoor which we did.  We got the lamb and beef kabobs as well as an order of butter chicken and garlic naan.  Kabobs were excellent!  The butter chicken looked oily but thankfully didn't taste oily.  It was the weakest part of the meal but still good.  Garlic naan was good as well.  Seriously stick with the tandoor items!  Service was attentive but the place is slightly ghetto."}
{"text":"A refreshingly different setting either in the restaurant or the tented parking lot next door, we were tempted by the good reviews about food quality.   You will have decent meal if you stick to a kebab and wrap it up in a naan; everything else bathes in oil and frankly you can do much better elsewhere on Gerrard East.  What more, the prices will make you wince after you've familiarised yourself with the plastic tables, cutlery and plates.  An interesting experience - mainly due to the randomly hanging saris - but one I do not particularly want to repeat."}
{"text":"Best visited in the summer to get the full experience. Delicious Pakistani food enjoyed in an authentic environment. The restaurant comes to life at night when the bright patio lights cascades off the colourful decor! You will feel like you've left Toronto. If you go, you must order the pani poori from the pani poori stand. Trust me full flavour explosion!"}
{"text":"Excellent, albeit a little greasy, Indian street food. The restaurant and decor is great. Lots of space and tables for the whole family. Great little patio out front with tented outdoor seating on the side. Good, fast takeout. The biryani, butter chicken, bharta, and chana are all standouts."}
{"text":"I was trolling yelp this morning and really had a craving for Indian unfortunately it was 9am and had to have a small bowl of cereal to wait for the restaurants to open.  Drove down to Queen to Amaya, although they have 12 noon as opening knock on door and they weren`t ready for anyone till 2pm.  So off I went to Lahore which we usually go to and I`m glad I did.  As always the staff is so friendly and ready with recommendations. I  wish the reno would be over and done with I think the Taj Mahal took less time to build.  The makeshift trailers which were once endearing are a bit tired.    The order was for 2 adults and 3 tweens takeout:  2 Meat Samosa 2 Veggie Samosa 2 Lamb Kebabs 1 butter chicken 1 chicken tikka briyani 1 aloo Gobi 1 small beef kebab wrab 3 naans (raita, tamarind sauce and lettuce mixture)  $53.83  (ready in 20 minutes)  The samosa are good just wish they were hot off the press instead of in the cooler at the front.  The lamb kebabs are on the small side but spiced well and very good.  The butter chicken is limited in chicken and a bit greasy but the spice is hot and I do like it.  The Briyani was perfect and actually had more chicken then the butter dish.  Aloo Gobi still has the intregity of the cauliflower and not greasy.  The small beef kebab was split between two of the kids they loved it.  Naan always on the mark.  We really enjoyed our lunch and Lahore never seems to let us down, I did ask for lite on spice for kid purposes but it was still spicy perfect for me and I think I would ask for it if we were san little ones.  Left overs were there.  I won't eat-in until the new place is done. Until then takeout suits."}
{"text":"People who believe this to be authentic Indian food are horribly wrong. Being Indian myself and having tried Indian food all over the world, I can gladly say this is the worst place ever. I don't even know where to begin my review.   The inside is meh and whatever. I like how they try to be authentic with the decor and added tid bits here and there.   The food, well it's actually Pakistani cuisine not Indian and people who think it's the same ITS NOT THE SAME. Everything tastes the same, same masalas and it's always spicy as hell even when you ask for mild. I can't even begin to describe the amount of oil and grease they incorporate into each dish. I feel like nothing is made in a tandoor as they say because it always has huge amount of oil on it. I don't even know if they have a proper chef because the quality of food is below par, along with presentation and taste. You can't just add huge amounts of spices on different meats and say they are different dishes. I'm sure people believe this to be good food although it's not. And I've been here many many times and finally stopped coming when I've found other places with good Indian food, that doesn't make me sick.   I don't know how hygienic the staff is because I see some servers blowing their nose on their shirts and serving us the food. And it can probably explain why my friends and I get diarrhea each time. So I hope a food inspector comes and sees if the health and safety regulations are up to date.    I'm sorry I just never had a good experience at this place and I've tried all their dishes. I dislike the customer service and even more the atmosphere.   I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Food is seasoned perfectly every time! I will say that there is normally a bit of an oil slick on top of most dishes though... happy they are finally using real plates and not just throwing out styrofoam anymore.  Price point is awesome, bring at least 4 people to eat properly, portions are big"}
{"text":"Long story short. The food is awesome to me, while the environment is quite street-style. The experience is quite interested. If my friend doesn't speak so good about it, I probably wouldn't dine in here forever. We had butter chicken and lamb curry with garlic naan. The dishes are so flavourful and rich. We got food coma after this. Both dishes are great, I especially loved my friend's lamb curry. Lol"}
{"text":"For the longest time I have been ordering take-outs of the beef kebabs.For the past couple of years we didn't order anything from here. So last evening we decided to eat in. We get there around 7 pm and were told by the 'hostess' that it would take 15 minutes to get a table for 4.We patiently waited and after about 20 minutes were led to a table.We were surprised when she gave us a small white board and told us to write our order.We did it and waited for a waiter to pick it up. A waitress came asking if we'd like some drinks and we asked for water which she promptly served. All the while the white board with the order is still sitting on the table and the waitress has come twice to our table and not said a word. After a while I called one of the waitresses and asked her what to do with the white board. I was told to take it to the cashier who would then give me a number and after that our food would arrive. I go up to the cashier and there already is a long line which I join and my order is finally taken after 20 minutes in the restaurant. To my utter shock the food arrives within 5 minutes. It looks greasy and the so-called biryani portion is huge.I then went looking for a waitress for a knife and fork for the kebabs. The kebabs were undercooked. In fact the lamb kebab was almost raw.The naan was the worst naan I've ever eaten. I don't think it was done in a Tandoor. Obviously they brought the food in less than 5 minutes so it was expected.. They were willing to replace the lamb kebab and the naans but we said enough is enough and asked for the bill.I was told to join the line to the cashier once again to pay for a bill that was totally unjustified. Whilst all this was going on people were still crowding the entrance waiting for tables. Something is definitely wrong.The place is old and looks dirty. The tables are rickety. The food is awful. The service is terrible. The pricing is crazily high - yet  they were busy!"}
{"text":"Funky place in Little India, decorated with lights and tapestries. This was my first true Pakistani dining experience. I found the food heaviier in spicing and oil or ghee than most Indian food.    The chana masala we ordered hot and it sure was. The kids had mild chicken tikka and we had spicy butter chicken.  The butter chicken and chana masala were in a pool of oil. Let's just say we had a little bit of trouble digesting it. The salad was a nice foil to the rich main dishes.  The staff was extremely personable and took a family vacation photo for us after they saw us taking photos of the kids sitting on the chairs."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to place for Pakistani food in the summer time  The inside area is small, but during warmer weather, they open up their outdoor tented area which can fit a lot of people. Decorated with lines of colourful lights and constantly full with people, it offers a fun and lively environment.   Don't be fooled by the plastic chairs, plastic utensils and styrofoam cups that they offer you. Their food is DELICIOUS.  Their Chicken Biryani came out sizzling on a hot platter and it was piled extremely high. Way more than enough to feed 3 people. But the dish that they really do well is their Seek Kabobs (we ordered beef) with a few side order of Naan.  Best I've ever had. I can't wait to go back once the warmer weather hits. They also make their own Kalfi (like creamier popsicles). Their mango ones are delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing service great food ... We were told about this place by a friend .. We were greeted by the door happily ... My 2 yeaR old was treated like a little king!!! It was obviously our first time at an authentic Indian restaurant and everyone was very kind and informative ... Yes the plates are styrofoam and the cutlery plastic... But the food and service make everything fun and kinda like an indoor picnic..... Yum Yum Yum ... So many choices can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I love the chicken in three ways that was soooo good! So much taste  , first time I came here and very impressed! Well done!"}
{"text":"Gunnar V (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lahore-tikka-house-toronto#hrid:cZ2W_U6AOJZTkmQ5nTs0LQ) said it best. There are two types of people...those who like LTH, and those who don't. Put me in the latter camp.  Pros; They serve \"food\". Cons;  -Said food is incredibly oily. Unbelievably. I'd NEVER seen so much oil. -Feel like an appetizer? Hope you like samosas. (The only choice). Hope it's a weekend. (Only available then.) -The food IS tasty. I'll give them that. Problem is, it all tastes the same. -The aloo gobi on the \"Combo sizzler\" was one large piece of overcooked cauliflower, and I believe my wife got the piece of potato. -Presentation is horrific. -Mango lassis are served out of a large dispenser. Not horrible, but far from good. -The floor is VERY slippery. I assume it is oil tracked from the kitchen on the servers shoes. BE CAREFUL. -Despite NUMEROUS servers, you go to the cashier to order. -Plastic furniture.  The following is not just a \"con\", it's a deal breaker. All food is eaten off of disposable foam plates with plastic knives and forks. Water is offered in foam cups, lassi in disposable plastic cups. Imagine the garbage this place produces.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This four star rating is totally for the Seekh Kabab and Kashmiri Chai. These two items were absolutely mouth-watering and worth the trip.  The decor is a tad tacky and they serve food on styrofoam plates and cups (not cool) and they give you a whiteboard to write your order in and then you go give it to someone at the register. Our food came in 10mins but was hot and tastes great.   Will definitely go back for the Seekh Kabab and chai."}
{"text":"I had not been here in a couple years because I live in the US now.   I used to live down the street from here and eat at least once a month.  This place has gone way way down from what I remember and is no longer on my must have eats list.  The food was average at best.  Kabobs came out in 2 minutes and we're not sizzling but appeared to be off a warmer.  Naans were chewy and obviously not fresh from tandoor.  Raita from a squirt bottle - ew - nuff said.  The Biryani was acceptable.  Glasses were dirty ... We had to pass on the water.  We asked the evil owner lady at the cash if most of our food could be brought out together.  She said she was too busy and we should ask our server.  There were about 16 people in the whole restaurant with no line at around 4PM ... Not sure what she was too busy with standing around at the cash apparently doing a lot of nothing.  Thank god we had a young lady who provided great service else this would have been a zero star experience.  Not likely to return."}
{"text":"Tastes delicious for the first time but over another 2 visits the real taste is unified for all of the dishes of different kinds. That means fish tastes same like lamb like chicken like beef like other vegetarian dishes. The reason behind that is the spices and the large amounts of cooking oil in the ingredients. Prices are more on the higher side slightly as compared to the quality and value.  Service is somewhat quick but there's no continuous attention for the client. Once your dish is on table younger not get someone until you're ready to pay. So if you need something else you got to go to the cashier to request it or at least stand up and chase the service boys. Bathrooms on the other hand, you don't want to be disturbed after your meal. So better you bring some wet wipes or wash at home."}
{"text":"Straight up, everyone here will tell you that construction at LTH has been going on FOREVER. They're getting close, though! I went a couple of weeks ago  and the bathrooms are so swanky in comparison to the trailer entrance. The patio is in full operation too.  This is not the place to go if you want a posh romantic restaurant with fancy cutlery, fabric napkins and mood lighting. Here, you get styrofoam plates and cups, plastic utensils, patio furniture and fluorescent lights. It's okay though, because the food is worth it. Plus, if it bothers you to eat there, you can always take-out.  Another bonus is that the servers there are attentive and friendly and will gladly make recommendations if you're unsure. They're speedy and they have no problem packing your leftovers for you (if you have any, that is).    My favourite dishes: -Chicken tikka masala (spicy!) -Chicken biryani or Vegetable biryani (both goood!) -Palak paneer -Chana masala -Aloo gobi   I've also tried the butter chicken. I'm not the biggest fan of butter chicken in general, so I can take it or leave it, but if you love a sweeter butter chicken and don't love a lot of hot spice, then you probably would not like LTH's butter chicken. Also, if you're into A LOT of sauce, these dishes may disappoint you too. But as far as taste goes, they do not skimp on aromatic spices. The naan is pretty standard.   PS: if you just want a snack, their samosas are delicious!!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said in the rest of the reviews? The food here is simply delicious, bursting with endless spices and flavours. Love the biryani, kabob sizzlers, kulfi and of course that butter chicken! The hole in the wall environment works.Toronto needs more places like this. If you haven't been yet, just go now!"}
{"text":"This place is pure chaos! We went around 9pm and Lahore Tikka House was filled to the brim. We walked and had no idea where check in as there were people standing around everywhere, waiters running around carrying huge trays and several different lines for no apparent reason. Once we finally got our name on the list, we were told the wait was 30-45 min. Because of the pure disarray, we probably would have left if it weren't for the recommendations from a friend. Luckily we decided to wait it out and were surprisingly seated within 15min.   We were seated right in front of the open kitchen which was eye opening because I could watch the chaos at the source. There were about 20+ people in that kitchen, with half of then standing around drinking soda, chatting and dancing. No wonder it took about 30 min for us to get our food.   Once were were seated, we were handed a white board to write our order, which is a great idea because I have no idea how a waiter could hear the order over the cacophony of the restaurant. They have huge menu with tons of delicious options. My friend recommended the Karachi tea and I couldn't resist ordering a falooda (dessert is always better before dinner!). Both were delicious. I have never had Karachi tea so it was fun to try. We ordered the beef kababs, chicken biryani and garlic naan. Honestly every looked and smelled better than it actually tasted. Also, make sure you order raitha with the biryani because it is not included. My friend ordered the lamb chops and those were actually amazing. They came on a sizzler and were perfectly cooked. Definitely recommend ordering those.   Paying is also a huge ordeal. You have to wait in this huge line which again is all disorganized. Try to get your friend to stand in line and dip across the street and buy some meetha paan, which will be probably the best thing you eat that night."}
{"text":"Customer service is great, very short wait time. Food taste is authentic. Couldn't enjoy ambience due to rain. Overall a good experience"}
{"text":"There are two kinds of people: those who like Lahore and those who don't. I am firmly in the second category. I haven't been since the restaurant finished construction. Before you would eat in trailers on folding tables and there was a propane heater blowing a foot long flame to keep the place warm in the winter. I don't know how anyone could defend paying money for such an atmosphere. Beyond that, the food is terrible. Extremely greasy, with unrecognizable meats and no fresh vegetables. Anyone who has been to Dhaba, Trimurti or Banjara couldn't fail to see the quality gulf that exists between Lahore and the civilized world."}
{"text":"After enjoying the afternoon at Woodbine beach, a friend recommended this place for some decent South Asian food. We went on a Sunday night and there were several groups of friend and families waiting outside making it very promising. The restaurant is very large so we only had to wait 15 minutes which was relatively short given that there were several groups of 6 or more ahead of us. Their covered patio is one the largest I've been to in Toronto.  You write your order on a mini blackboard which is an interesting concept. We decided to do family style eating and ordered: Naan Bread, Paneer Masala, Butter Chicken, Lamb Kebabs, Chicken Kebabs, Lamb Briyani, Channa, Tikka Chicken and Falooda.   The food was very flavourful and texturally accurate. The portions were adequate.  The butter chicken however could have been slightly juicier. It was a little dry for my liking.  The food came out quickly and the service was good.  It was a reasonable $20/person (includes tip and tax) given that we left highly satisfied and full. I recommend this place and would come back again."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place 5 stars for their food, however I wish a few things would improve: 1. The bathroom is disgusting. I've been to Lahore tikka house many many times and every time I've gone to the bathroom to even wash my hands it's a mess with water and tissue paper everywhere. 2. In the summer if it gets too crowded, you have to sit in the part of the restaurant that has no AC which can make it unbearable to sit because of the lack of air circulating, and no AC"}
{"text":"Nothing more to add, I feel like everyone else has hit the mark with their descriptions. It is an amazing place, and yes authentic, the food is great, but there are some factors that have caused me to devalue this spot.  Well, my complaint is that they obviously are catering to a certain type of demographic which leaves the rest of the demographics who would like to discover South Asian food out in the cold. So here goes:  For one thing, why plastic plates and cutlery all the time? Come on people, haven't we heard that there's an island of plastic floating around the Pacific Ocean that we should be concerned about? Google that up if you've never heard of it (great pacific garbage patch). For some people this may not be a deal breaker, but for a restaurant I would think that some cutlery could be afforded.  Another thing, why is this place always under construction? For the last 5 or who knows how many years it has been like that. It has great great potential, but falls short because of the sub par decor, and the sense of being rushed a bit when I am eating there during the summer time, in order that the next customer can take my place.  But if you just want to eat genuine Pakistani food and you're not bothered by the amount of plastic that goes through this place, and the decor, then it's not bad at all."}
{"text":"The strangest restaurant I've visited ...  From the outside, the restaurant looks like a house covered in colourful cloth ... so entering the restaurant feels like you are entering a house ... a cloth covered house.  Inside, the walls are also covered in cloth.  There are also twinkly fairy lights.  In the background, you hear clubbing dance music.    Sort of felt like I was on set for Slumdog Millionaire.  Food is pretty decent but didn't bow my mind like I was hoping...  Veggie Biryani was my favourite - by far!  Food is served on styrofoam plates with plastic cutlery.    Not sure why but the mood seemed kind of depressing to me.  There were these young guys with big black garbage bags wandering around clearing tables into these bags.  Made me think of that scene in slumdog where the kids are in the garbage dump picking through the trash.  It was interesting :)"}
{"text":"I loved my Tikka Masala and the garlic naan was the best I've had. I'll definitely go back. I am really curious about the Makhani you all rave about here as it wasn't on the menu today. Oh, and about the atmosphere, rather the lack of one... I liked it. It really makes you focus on your food and the maze-like layout of the place coupled with the large voids on the main floor made me feel like I was truly in Pakistan! Friendly service to boot. I am a new fan of LTH. Perhaps I'll bump up my rating next visit!"}
{"text":"Writing this review, I'm almost scared to express anything less than wonder, for fear that my infinitely more culturally authentic friends will smack me upside the head for having the nerve to speak through my ignorance - and about their beloved Lahore TIkka at that (though, fear not, my uninformed thoughts are nevertheless quite positive) - but in my mouth I trust, so I will say it as I tasted it.  We had the karahi gosht, sizzling beef ribs, and chicken biriyani, along with naan and kashmiri chai (mmm). I loved the kashmiri chai, which has inspired me to make it my next DIY project (but then, you throw pistachios in just about anything and I'm sold). And the chicken biriyani is, without doubt, the finest I have tasted, with exquisitely tender, perfectly seasoned chicken, which was saturated to the bone with flavour. The rest of the food was also quite good, and expertly seasoned... but (and I tremor to say this) I think it is possible that I have had better (gasp!). It's also worth noting that the food was liberally oily, all was served almost fast-food-style (styrofoam + disposable cutlery, order up front), and you will come away with a day's worth of gastritis as a souvenir - but I can get over these things pretty easily, if only for that chicken and the kashmiri chai.  Overall, I can see where people are coming from - on both sides. This is a place where flavour rules, but they're not going out of their way to please you. They do what they do, and if you don't like it there's more than enough people who do, so you can just move along and stop taking up space from someone who will appreciate it.  I think I have to come back for that chicken biriyani though. It's really not an option."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance!! Love all the authentic Pakistani decor!!!Great service and good food. Had lots on the menu as well as fresh spicy vegetables and desserts made the true Pakistani way. Worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"I found their ordering system somewhat confusing (as a newbie) and I didn't like the paper plates and plastic cutlery.  But the food was bursting with so much flavour that I ended up not caring.  I tried two diffferent Lahori kebabs, beef karahi, aloo gobi, and rice.  That being said, the food was on the oily side but perhaps that's why it tasted so good.  A terrific introduction to Pakistani food."}
{"text":"I love this place the the reason I give it a 4/5 is that over the years the service and food have really taken a hit.  When I first started going here almost eight years ago the food, portion size, and service was amazing.  Now we go and portion size is half.  Prices have gone up. However food taste is still good it's not the same.  Sometimes a hit or miss.  My favourite is the beef ribs.  They never disappoint. The lab chops are flavourful and tasty.  The seekh kabobs are well cooked but on the small side. We eat street style and it's a fun touch.  You basically find your own table and then the server comes  and takes your order.  You also go up and pay with your table number.  This place is huge so they feel this is the best way to handle service. Over all I love this place and will always go back"}
{"text":"awesome food..tasty food... have been here number of times and will def keep going there...and its not at all costly..."}
{"text":"What a great place! The food is delicious and the staff is very attentive. We asked the food to be mild (one of us did not like spicy food - not me) and the waiter told us to try it regular and that if it was to spicy, they would exchange it. Now that's what I call customer service!  All the food that we order was very tasty. They even sometimes pass around with samples of food. I got to taste a grilled spicy pepper.  We even tried their homemade desserts (Popsicles) which were also very good.  Otherwise don't go there thinking that this is an Indian restaurant because it is actually Pakistani. That being said, they don't serve any alcohol.  One last thing, we got real plates and not styrofoam plates like others commented. Not that it would change anything!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hello Family and Friends.....I would like to request everyone to avoid going to Lahore Tikka House in Toronto. Our group of friends recently went there and were faced with the horrible attitude of an extremely rude and arrogant owner. They have an idiotic \"no stroller\" policy which forces parents to take the babies out of strollers even if the baby is sleeping. Even after pleading to them that the baby was sleeping they did not show any compassion.  However, it is not the stupid policy that is the cause of my appeal to everyone, it is the rude, arrogant, and demeaning attitude that the lady owner displayed when handling the situation. No customer should ever have to be treated that way. The owners have to keep in mind that they are there because of the customers and we have the ability to take away their arrogance and power.  I have been a long time customer of Lahore Tikka House but after the way they treated us, I will never ever step foot in that place again until the owner or management changes.  I hope this message gets to the right people where changes can be made for the better of the service to the public.  Sincerely,  Sam Jaffer"}
{"text":"Styrofoam cups and plastic lawn chairs, this restaurant survives solely on its amazing food. Ordered the Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer, Butter Naan, and Lamb & Beef Kebobs, all of which are MUST try dishes!! Don't go there for the service or the atmosphere, go there for down to earth, down right good indian food."}
{"text":"I was surprised by their quality of food. We ordered butter chicken, chicken tikka and seekh kabobs. Everything tastes fresh and flavorful. I've been to Lahore tikka before a couple of years back but this time around I saw a lot of improvements especially with the interior of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The place was packed when we showed up at 8:30 pm on a weekday, but we were seated fairly quickly considered the huge line we were standing in.   There were four of us and we ordered: Chicken Biryani 2 Lahori Lamb Kabab 4 Naans (1 Garlic, 2 Butter and 1 Sesame)  Fish Masala (I think) Sweet Lassi Salty Lassi  I have to say something first before I talk about the food. You can't beat eating outside in a big tent on a picnic table with plastic cutlery and plates. I was quite shocked but any skepticism I had disappeared with the first taste of the food. The lamb kababs came out sizzling on a hot plate with onions swimming in grease....MMMM :) My favourite was the butter naan and the chicken biryani which I smothered with the spiced yogurt that they serve at each table. It's a great cooling agent! None of us were a fan of the sesame naan. Frankly, I don't even know why it was ordered! The salt lassi was very bad. It was too aromatic for my liking. My friend enjoyed the sweet lassi though! We never got our fish dish! We reminded the waiter a couple of times and he in turn reminded the kitchen but we never did get it, so we asked them to take it off our bill.  The staff was very efficient and friendly. I liked that at some point during dinner we heard applause and laughter from the kitchen. It sounded like a small celebration. I liked that. The staff at Lahore Tikka seemed like a big pleasant family.   The best part is that we split the bill 4 ways, and we each paid $10! The food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Located on Gerrard in Little India, Lahore brings you Pakistani Vs. North Indian cuisine. If you seek an explosion of flavour in your mouth, and maybe somewhere else, this is the spot. Because North India is so close to Pakistan, many of the dishes have elements in common. These commonalities make for a fusion orgasm.     From the Pakistani side you are graced with various karahi's and nihari (curries), tawa qeema mutter (minced beef w/ peas), and various kebabs and biryanis. Lahore boasts the best kebabs in Toronto. Yea I said it. Order seekh, beef, lamb or chicken kebabs, they will arrive at your table minutes later popping and sizzling with heat from the tandoor (clay oven), covered in caramelized onions and glorious seasonings. Their kebabs are so good, that I just drooled a bit into the keyboard.   From the North Indian side you are graced with the classics: Butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, channa masala (pea curry) aloo gobi (potato/cauliflower), & matter paneer (peas/cheese) just to name a few. Take my word, Lahore has some of the best butter chicken I have ever had, and I have eaten butter chicken from all over the GTA to India itself. Remember I spoke of how powerful the fusion can be? Well this dish is the perfect example of that. It arrives at your table bubbling in cast iron skillets, so silky, so rich and has a smoke infused taste. Not sure if it's all the ghee or almond butter (2 key semi-secret ingredients to making amazing butter chicken) the tandoor or just plain love, but this BC is phenomenal. Many will argue Moti Mahal down the road has better butter chicken, but see for yourself and you be the judge. My vote remains with Lahore.     My ideal order for 4.   2 orders of Seekh Kebab (4 total) 2 orders of Lahori Beef Kebab (4) 2 Lamb Kebab Rice Sizzler.   2 Butter Chickens 1 Karahi Beef 1 Matter Paneer  4 Butter naans  After the meal I recommend grabbing a pistachio kulfi (ice cream) on your way out to cool down.  In your research of this restaurant you may find a fair amount of negative reviews; however I feel these reviews are based on individuals ordering the wrong items and one off experiences that I feel every restaurant has. If you stick close to my ideal order above, you too will catch yourself drooling into your keyboard. \"Lahore Tikka House pwns kebabs and butter chicken, simply ghee-licious \" - Me  *Lahore has been under renovations for only god knows how long now. Washrooms are new and well maintained."}
{"text":"The inches this place has put on my waist. I LOVE it so much. Sure the potions are small and the dishes are a bit more expensive than most places but every time I've been here (and it's very often) the service is amazing, the food is delicious and I have yet to have a complaint.   Love the vibe and feel of the place post renovations too. What I like the most about this place compared to other Indian joints is that they pay a whole lot of attention to service.   I also love that it's very authentically Pakistani. Not South Indian or Indian; PAKISTANI!!!  My recommendations are the fish masala, the paneer tikka masala, chicken karahi (my favourite in the city it's hard to get this right in my books but they do!!), lamb biriyani.   The dishes I would never order again are the daal, the peas, and some of the vegetarian options are a bit of a let down.   Going there today in fact!!!! Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Incredible food and service! They've really improved on both since the last time I went there which was about a year ago. We ordered the chicken tikka which was absolutely amazing- well seasoned and extremely tender. We also ordered chicken karahi, paneer tikka masala, butter naan and basmati rice. Everything was spot on with flavours and aroma! Our server was extremely friendly, came by our table frequently and was prompt at refilling water! To finish it all off we ordered kashmiri chai which is only served Fri-sunday ( a MUST have if you're there on these days), its the best on the whole little India Gerrard strip! Definitely recommend this place now. Giving it 4 stars out of skepticism for the previous experiences which sometimes have been a miss, otherwise today's experience was definitely worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has a rundown feel for it, the food is greasy, and the cutlery is trash. But I love the damn food, and we keep coming back. Over and over."}
{"text":"Great food but it's usually very busy. We ordered their chicken karahi, daal masala and beef kebab. The beef kebab wasn't very tasty. The chicken curry and daal masala was good. I prefer the garlic naan more than the butter naan even though the garlic naan is a little saggy. They also serve grilled salted green chillies on request. This adds a delicious and refreshing taste to the food."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Pakistani food. Recently some clients from the subcontinent wanted to try it out. This place doesn't serve any alcohol so we decided to try out the place across from it. Oh man that place was just plain awkward and we felt so out of place there (even the bartender had a look what are you folks doing here) there was a funny/scary incident that made us bolt out of there but I guess that is a story for another day. We went overboard and ordered the following dishes Brain Masalla, Nihari, Chicken Boti, Beef Rib, Biryani and another dish I can't seem to recall. All this for 3 people. I luved Brain Masalla and so did my associates and they said it reminded them of home. Nihari was just ok so was the biryani. Beef rib was more like Korean Kalbi and felt out of place. Chicken Boti was regular BBQ stuff. So why the four stars great value and pretty authentic food. There are other place in the city but I think they are too westernized to be called that. The place has ambience that will not appeal to a lot of people and trip to the new washroom is strange walk through what seems like an incomplete banquet hall. Nevertheless if you are looking for authentic food  this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great picnic tabled patio in summer. Sauces are overly oily and skimpy on portions (all sauce). My guess is that they are coasting on former glory."}
{"text":"This is no longer the Lahore tikka house we used to come to. The owner has passed away and whoever (his son or family) is running the operations seems to be fixated on cost cutting. Nothing wrong there except the customer  experience has gotten so compromised that the good taste of the food has been overshadowed by  napkins that are as thin as a toilet roll. That's not all you  no longer get salad with food. Water jugs are not provided (give me a glass with more than 100ml capacity), Naans seem to have come out of warmer to not keep the tandoor running at all time. Your $3 for a micro kaboob no longer gets you the bowl of raita. Cost cutting measures allow them to only give raita in a squirt type bottle and it doesn't taste fresh for obvious reasons.  First the price increases came few years ago. But they upped their game on many fronts. Now the prices are high and deliverables are reduced. Such unjustified greed generally turns people off and I know my family and friends are not coming back.  What the owner doesn't understand is that you may have saved a few cents by giving me thin napkin. In this process you have lost customers completely and my $50-$80 tab. Congratulations!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge, food is delicious. The fish curry is amazing, the saag is amazing, my Dad couldn't stop talking about his tandoori chicken. Definitely a spot to hit if you're in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place..some of the best Indian/Pakistani food I've ever had and I'm a huge lover of this ethnic genre! My family and I go there and order almost the whole menu! The nann is the freshest and most delicious I've ever had. Great for leftovers as well! Really cool atmosphere, laid back and the guys that work there are hilarious and very nice!"}
{"text":"Have to say that Lahore Tikka House is my abso-favourite for Pakistani/Punjabi food.   Bring your mental passport, because, when you walk through that door, you leave white-bread country behind you. That first whiff of spices stirs the mirrorwork hangings, and boom-shaka-laka - you're at a lorry driver's dhaba on the Grand Trunk Road. (I mean that in the good way). Take a number at the front counter and walk to a table in the restaurant's fragrant belly - an adventure is about to begin.  My favourite: a lamb biryani with tender cubes of lamb on and off the bone, with a pair of grilled sea-salt sprinkled green chillies for explosive oral pleasure. Their kababs cooperatively fall apart in the mouth allowing you to fit in more in short order. Their palak is lovely - I hate the mush that you find so often in other places - here the fibrous pleasures of leafy spinach are actually left intact. Try the haleem - I describe it as beaten-wheat-and-meat garnished with matchsticks of ginger. The only thing missing is an ice cold beer - they don't serve any alcohol.  Finish with the home-made malai kulfi, pressed around chopsticks to round off your multicultural mouth-and-mind-blowing trip.   It's a big finish. Walk all the way home. Even if you live in the west end."}
{"text":"It was a place to check out and we had a good experience after all. Just too greasy and a bit over rated for the service you get."}
{"text":"Brain Masala and butter naaan. Never disssapoints."}
{"text":"I am giving a 4 based on previous excellent times at Lahore. My latest trip definitely does not deserve that high.  We have been there dozens of times, although not much since my kids were born. When wifey was preggo with kid #1 we lived down the street, and the Karahai Beef was one of her main craving go-tos. It is not the Ritz...paper plates, foam cups, plastic forks...but really who needs more than that.  Loved the Beef Kebab, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chana Masala and Aloo Gobi over the years. Naan is always good, Kulfi is almondy, and  the I love the Chai.  Loved it so much we have taken our parents there. Paper plates and all.  Not so anymore, but I will chalk it up to an anomaly. Last time we went, food was greasy and less flavourful than usual, but maybe it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"I still say this place is disastrous in terms of how environmentally UNfriendly it is.  Really?  After years and years of renos, we still have to eat off of styrofoam plates and use plastic cutlery?  At least the building is no longer a fire hazard of wooden planks.  It looks like a more \"finished\" structure than what I remember.    I was able to try the following:    Veggie pakora  Butter chicken  Lamb curry  Curried lentils Chana masala Chicken kebabs  Naan bread Rice Almond kulfi  The amount of ghee used is still pretty heavy but all the dishes were very tasty.  This is not a meal for anyone on a diet.  Chana masala was definitely the highlight.  Not greasy, lots of veggies, and extremely flavourful.  I couldn't stop eating it.    Zero stars for the amount of waste produced as a result of dishwashing savings."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner (table 80 at around 9:00 PM), they don't give you a bill but just tell you to bring your number up and pay the price they tell you.   We had:   Butter Chicken $12.99 Lamb Biryani $14.99  2 regular naan $3.00 1 butter naan $2.00  When got to the register she told me I had to pay $54.00 and that was not including any tip (which you have to leave in cash only).  I paid by debit but didn't do the math on spot and only realized after the fact that I had been ripped off.  I tried calling right away as i was driving home but of course no one picks up the phone here.  If someone does not contact me I will be making a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great, casual, atmosphere. The food is amazing and worth every penny. Pricing is very affordable and you get a lot of food for the price. In the summer it has a great patio and decor creating a very authentic feel."}
{"text":"Perhaps I came in with too many expectations, but my visit to the restaurant was tremendously, tremendously underwhelming.   My party of 4 came in on a weekday mid-afternoon, and it wasn't tremendously busy, with quite a few empty seats. However, it took them forever to seat us, and when they did, it was next to a table with a bunch of dirty dishes stacked on top of each other, and they did not bother to clean it up during the entire 40 minute duration. At any other restaurant, it wouldn't have been a problem, but at Lahore Tikka House, where space was tremendously limited, it was like eating admist the previous person's filth. When I finally notified a waiter of the situation, he told me \"you really should have told me about this earlier.\"  I mean, really? This is your job, and during an off-peak time, should you really need a customer to tell you about a very visible problem?   Besides that, the portions were tremendously small, and although I have nothing bad to say about its quality (average), it really wasn't worth the price at all, and I felt very ripped off. I will not be coming back, and will not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Due to some vigilante Yelpers I've been forced to update my last review. Originally I said it was Indian Food, its not, its Pakistani or South Asian cuisine. Pakistani food is quite different from Indian food, especially from Bengal or the South. It focuses more on Lamb and other meats and has a hardier feel. Even though Lahore Tika is in the Little India neighborhood, it is Pakistani (as are alot of the businesses here). My original review still stands about the quality so check it out."}
{"text":"For a table of six, we ordered a boatload of food:  Veg Biryani, Lamb Biryani, Aloo Gobi, Palak Paneer, Paneer Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, Chicken/Botti Sizzler and a Beef/Lamb Sizzler. We also ordered Kashmiri Chai, very different than our usual Chai. This has the addition of crushed pistachios and cashews and was pink in color; very tasty.   In addition we also ordered some some buttered and garlic naan. I normally don't like garlic naan, but I tasted some and had to order one, it was deliciously made here.  The veggie dishes were loaded with oil, so that was kind of a drawback. I wasn't feeling the Paneer Tikka Masala much, but the Aloo Gobi was amazing. The Lamb Biryani was the best thing on the table, perfectly cooked.  Finally we ordered Kheer and Kulfi; both were delicious, but a resounding \"yes\" went to the Kulfi when we ordered a second batch.  Needless to say, we went home with plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"This isn't exactly the place you take some one on a first date or any thing like that, for one the use of disposable plates, cups and even forks. Half the restaurant sits under a tent in what looks the be the parking lot, mind you this is on a slant with what looks to be used patio furniture that was acquired from Kijiji or the side of the road.  You sit down pick what you want, go up and order your food and place a number on your table! Not exactly classy, but here is the thing, they have really really good food! And be sure to ask for the roasted peppers! It's a must!!!! Worth checking out if u go with a friend or two and have low expectations only go for the food! And remember it gets realllly busy so be ready to wait!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service. The prices were a bit on the higher side but still reasonable for the quality of the food.   We got the Chicken Tikka Biriyani (boneless), a beef kabab, chicken kabab, garlic naan and a butter naan.   This was more than enough food for 3-4 people, especially the Biriyani which has a lot of rice. The problem though was that they didn't have enough chicken.   The kabab were good too, I enjoyed the beef more than the chicken. I felt the chicken was a bit dryer. The naans were delicious - very soft and good portions.   Overall, I enjoyed the food here. We were recommended to this restaurant from a friend and decided to give it a try, and we're glad we did. Will stop by here next time I'm in the area as well and would definitely recommend this to a friend."}
{"text":"Love this place. On vacation with family, goggled it up, bit of a trip to get there, but worth it. Take trolley on Gerrard, west. True no beer and Styrofoam plates and plastic utensils but the food makes up for it. Every thing seasoned well and good portions, be prepared to share. Never been to Pakistan but the staff and the dining area with indoor outdoor picnic tables, makes it seem your there.  I forgot a bag when we left the place, but our waiter ran 1/2 a block to return."}
{"text":"Summer is the best time to visit Lahore Tikka House. The outside patio is a carnival of coloured lights strung from the inside of a giant tent. I have been coming here for years and kept a close eye on the transformation from backyard patio and fire pit with the cute rickshaw out front, to all of the above with a giant salmon coloured concrete building slapped in the middle. There is definitely a circus- feel to this place. Don't let the paper plates throw you off. The food is good and the service is fast and efficient once you place your order at the cash register and take your number to your table.  My third favourite Butter Chicken in Toronto is found here. It's smoky and hot with juicy tender pieces of tandoori chicken swimming in a rich slightly spicy sauce. They're really good at adjusting the spice for you. A few points are taken off for the oil slick on top, but you have to know, expect and accept that when coming here.   I also like their vegetarian platter. I always order it with Palak Paneer (a.k.a.Saag Paneer), Channa Masala, and Aloo Ghobi.  If you are there on the weekends, and an adventurous eater, try the Brains Masala. The naturally delicate flavour of the brains is enhanced by a rich spicy sauce.  You know your tandoori is going to be amazing when you walk through the restaurant and see a massive fire pit where several men are braving the jumping flames to pull out naan, chicken and kebebs. Tandoori Chicken is always cooked to a blistered black perfection on the outside and juicy on the inside. If you're a meat eater, don't miss the Grilled Lamb Chops. It's weird, their on line menu doesn't feature this dish, but I've had it there many times. For a little over $13, it's a hefty portion of deliciously spiced dry rubbed lamb that melts in your mouth.  The prices have been raised over the past 6 years or so and the menu has become more convenience oriented with the prominence of wraps, where tandoori, sizzlers and curries seemed to dominate.  There is no liquor license, so either have a Lassi to cool off or BYO Flask. Always busy with lots of families, but a fun stop on my bike when I've spent a day at the beach. Decent value, great atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"Lahore Tikka House is a crazy place and has become crazy popular because it's crazy good!  I first came here a number of years ago when it felt like one of the trashiest places in the area. I mean that from a decor perspective and you'll still probably get hints of their dive origins because to this day, you're being served on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils. It's a kind of surreal experience and I almost wonder if it's the way a restaurant would be like back in Pakistan?  That being said, their food is fantastic, truly! My mother, at the age of 75, who had NEVER given a compliment to any restaurant we had EVER gone to in our entire lives claimed that the lamb chops were the best she had ever had. The lamb chops are my #1 dish that I must ALWAYS have when I go there but everything else is also very good.   If I were to ever complain about a thing here is that their biryanis are a tad too oily but that's what most people expect from a good biryani so I don't see Lahore Tikka house adjusting for my healthy standards. :P  I have one word of warning! If you plan to go here, I strongly suggest that you do not wear your best clothing because everything you wear will be permeated with the strong odor of spices and food that you smell and eat at this place. I shit you not, your skin will carry the smell as well. Even if this sounds like a terrible thing, I still encourage you to try this place out because it will be worth it in the end!  These days, my wife and I will only go here in the summer when we can eat outdoors on their large side lot patio to minimize the scents that we'll pick up.  This place is so unbelievably popular, that they have been struggling to expand the restaurant over the years. They used to have an old school portable up next to their main building. Now they have tented up their parking area to turn it into a serving area. It's crazy how popular this place is.  That all being said, their popularity has also allowed them to jack their prices up big time. Way beyond what you would expect from restaurants in the area and WAY beyond what you'd expect from a place that serves you food on disposable plates. :P  Again, this is an experience that everyone must have at least once and an experience that has been repeated over and over by everyone that I've introduced to the place.  ENJOY! :D"}
{"text":"Been here many, many times and will go again anytime. Food- Excellent, Spicy & in Abundance Atmosphere- Exotic, Busy, Interesting Service- Lots of Employees on Staff"}
{"text":"They have servers, but you have to write your order on a white board and bring it up to the front clerk. I would prefer the server handle this part, but once you order, your food is out within less than ten minutes which is great.  The food was decent - a bit greasy and the butter chicken seemed to be all sauce.  They also use Styrofoam cups, which is why I will not go back. There's no excuse. Use real cups and stop being wasteful!"}
{"text":"If you are a tourist (or Caucasian), do not eat here! Worst dining experience I have ever had. Zero service and out of all their dishes!  Very long (unorganized) wait to get a table. Then they hand you a mini white board so YOU can write your order down, then YOU can take it up to the counter, then YOU come back to the counter to pay after. Zero service. I'm surprised I didn't have to walk back into the kitchen to get my food.   I get up to the counter to have the rude lady (who doesn't speak English well) tell me they're out of Butter Chicken. What kind of Indian restaurant runs out of Butter Chicken!? So I ask what other dish is not too spicy, and she scoffed at me like I'm a stupid white girl. I finally get her to suggest Chicken Tikka, and take my order number back to my table.   The appetizer, rice and naan arrive relatively quickly, but no sign of the Tikka. After about 15 mins we ask the waitress to check on our order. Another 15 minutes go by, and now we're really hungry (and late for Victoria Day fireworks). We ask the server to check again, only to have her come back and tell us... They're out of Chicken Tikka too!   Thank goodness for my partner, who walked up to the counter and WAITED IN LINE to pay for the stupid rice and naan we ate, because I was about to storm out.   Literally the WORST dining experience I have had in my 32 years eating in Toronto."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian/Pakistani food I have had in North America. The most authentic sheikh khababs, fresh crisp butter naan, baigan bharta, biryani, nahari!!!  This place was crowed on a Monday night and it sure ought to be. I would recommend this for anyone looking for authentic Indian food. Service was wonderful. I loved the way, they brought out chillies on skewers.   Everything we had was worth trying. The free raita and red sauce was very interesting. They just laid on every table in squeeze  bottles.   Loved it. Must visit!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Pakistani food, the service was fast and good. I would like to point out that this is an authentic Pakistani restaurant not Indian, although some may confuse it with Indian but it's not. Will definitely come back. Especially for the lamb chops!"}
{"text":"I still find the food here really good. Have tried so many different things and I have never been disappointed.   However, I gotta admit that every time I come back, I have the impression that the food gets more expensive than my previous visit.   In the end, as long as the quality of the food and the portions served remain the same, I think I would turn a blind eye to surging prices.   Oh, one more thing: am I the only one that feel that the restaurant was much cosier when it wasn't a \"proper building\"?"}
{"text":"Really good Pakistani food. I'm told its very authentic and some of the best you will find. I loved the mango shake! Made from the best mangos available.   I split the buttered chicken and another beef dish with two others. The Nan was fantastic, as it usually is at these type of restaurants, and the buttered chicken was also very good. Portion sizes were great and there was definitely enough food to go around for all three of us to be full. If I were in the mood for this type of food and in this area again, I would head straight there."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant! Pretty much everything on the menu is delicious. This is usually my go to spot to eat at on this strip and honestly I just love to say Lahore lol! Try this place, you will love it."}
{"text":"Came here with the wifey.  Ordered the hara kabab wrap and a falooda. The wrap came in a thick Naan with chunks of green chicken. There was also some green chutney sauce in the Naan. Wrap was a bit dry. They should have served this in a paratha or roti. Naan makes it too thick and dry.    Falooda was tiny. You could have drank it with a straw it was so thin.  At the bottom was a very pasty like dollop of kulfi ice cream. Tasty but not authentic. Felt like the touristy version of a real falooda. They also have these pre made sitting in the fridge."}
{"text":"This place is as good as they say it is!   This is my must-go-to stop whenever I visit Toronto. We usually have a meal but we stopped by for snacks and tried the chaat papdi, pani puri, and mango shake. Literally, the best mango shake I've ever had, I highly recommend.   Only tip for management: We caught an employee who was making food in the front area of the restaurant eating the food while making it with the same gloves. It was a little unsettling to see. This was yesterday around 6."}
{"text":"Mmmmm ... everything.   LTH will never win awards for decor or for expedient renovations, but it certainly should hoist the bang-for-your-buck-Indian-Pakistani-experience championship belt in Little India, in my opinion. I'm also of the opinion that the wall decorations have nothing to do with the quality of food, so keep that in mind if you decide to read on.   I visited LTH again last night will some friends from out of town and it was a hit once again. 5 people, 7 dishes, 5 naan, $72 pre-tip. Yeah, baby!   I'm a big fan of almost everything on their menu, save for the butter chicken. It's way too oily for me, and I think it's missing that something I can't put my tongue on. The rest of the menu, however, is great. The palak paneer is flavourful with some zing, the chana masala has a great smoke and coriander burst, the lamb is fall-off-the-bone and the tandoori chicken was a little bit of heaven.   I'm certainly not an Indian or Pakistani expert, but I've yet to leave LTH thinking that my money could be better spent in the area with a bunch of great friends. And you know what, I like the fact that the tables and chairs are fold up, so take that!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go for butter chicken. Me and friends have been to this place many times and every time we get delicioius food with excellent service."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?   The mango lassi-delicious! Beef boti kabab, karai gosht (lamb), karai chicken-sizzling and fantastic! Garlic and butter naan-soft and flavorful! Malai kulfi-mmmmmmmmm..... Decor-creative dupattas and cozy atmosphere.... Staff-friendly and super efficient! Props-South Asian flags, baby taxi for photoshoot... Price-mad cheap for the quality/quantity! Diet- ruined ; But do I care? NO  Loved it, loved it, loved it! Might even go back to Toronto just to eat here :)  PS They are revamping the whole restaurant and expanding it...just think of the awesome food on the terrace that will be open in the summer!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 6 that were simply hungry. We ordered the Butter Chicken, Chicken Kabobs, Lamb Kabobs, and a Lamb Briyani plus a few other things.  Overall the food was fantastic. The Kabobs were simply amazing and the best part of the meal. The Butter Chicken was flavourful, and the garlic naan was the icing on the cake.  The service was great, minus getting the Biryani last but no real complaints there.   The Faludas were good too, they just did not have enough ice cream that a normal faluda would. Otherwise it was an enjoyable meal, and I would definitely recommend going here to others."}
{"text":"Food is very SALTY, excessively so. The meats are cold from inside. Seems they DONT make it fresh."}
{"text":"This is one of those Pakistani places that I go with a bunch of friends. About 8 of us go there to eat and clog our arteries.   Okay, first and foremost, this place has been 'under construction' for at least 4 years since I have known of it and some of my friends told me they have been under construction for far longer.   Now let's not kid ourselves, when you eat here, you are eating in glorified portables and during the summer they make their parking lot into a so-called \"patio.\" The food is served on paper styrofoam and the cutlery is plastic. The decor and everything about this place screams 'low, low budget' except for their bathrooms which are in the new building, they nice and are in huge contrast to the rest of this place.  So for sure you are not going for the decor. Service is basic but serviceable.   The food is not bad,  incredibly oily and unhealthy. However, it's very tasty and trust me,  you don't come to Tikka if you want to eat healthy food. Check your table after you and your group eat, the amount of grease is quite shocking.   Normally, I will avoid rice dishes and just go for the veggies and the meats. Most dishes are in the $9-$14 range so if order a number of dishes, then it adds up, but nothing surprising about that. Yet overall, I refuse to believe this is the best Pakistani place in Toronto, it can't be. But when I ask people about a great place in Toronto, almost everyone names this place.   Having said that, if you go with a group and eat communal style, everyone sharing, I think it enhances the experience. I would not take someone on a date here, for fear they might think I am cheap due to the horrible decor, however, I would go with a few friends simply because I do not know a better place.  All my Pakistani friends (4) think this place is great for the chicken, hence the name(!) but there are better options. Most of them in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I heard my colleagues praising this place for its famous Tikkas and shish .Yesterday was my first time and I was surprised to see that they have a large number of vegetarian options as well . I ordered combo sizzler with Nan !!! And it was just yummy and delicious ! So glad that I found grilled vegetables sizzler with lentils and chick peas !! Portion size was so generous and I had to box part of my delicious sizzler !!"}
{"text":"The food used to be better, now a lot of it tastes the  same as it's gained popularity over the years but this place is awesome to go to with a group.  For one on one or a very small number, there are better desi cuisines you can go to, and it's not super cheap, but it's awesome if you're with a group, especially on a nice evening, because it's chaotic, packed, full of staff, full of food options and sweets, and just a load of fun.  The place is decorated in saris with a rickshaw in the front. The food doesn't take too long to come but excellent indian/pakistani cuisine is not the reason to go, because it's not the greatest  Every time I go it seems to have expanded again, over the last 7 years.   Nonetheless, it's worth going.  Even though you'll find a lot of people of different races there, they tend to put  spice even if you ask for 'mild'."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a friend for 'snacks' last weekend. We were in Toronto 'exploring neighborhoods' (i.e. eating our way through them) and had just come from brunch/shopping/walking around Greek Town. We picked Lahore Tikka House because I had been here once before (years ago, at night, for dinner), and remembered it being a fun place with great kabobs.   We ordered one lamb kabob, one beef kabob and one chicken kabob, as well as masala and kasmiri chai. The kabobs were served sizzling with onions on a metal plate, and came with two sauces - a hot sauce and a yogurt sauce. I thought the portion size (we each ate half of each kabob) was perfect for our afternoon snack. Couple notes: the meat is ground up and the kabobs are hand-formed on the skewers (i.e. these are not skewers with chunks of meat). They are seasoned and seared and juicy and really delicious. I could not say any one (i.e. lamb/beef/chicken) was better than the other, so I would recommend all three, and personally, I liked the variety we got. The chai came unsweetened and a container of sugar was brought to the table with it so you could sweeten to your own tastes. The kasmiri chai was pink with chunks of almonds in it - we had never had anything like and enjoyed it. The masala chai was standard.   I am not sure if you would say that this is one of the best restaurants in Little India on this stretch of Gerrard, but this place definitely has an atmosphere that, now that I have been to India, reminds me of my time there. To me, it is sort of like a typical diner but serving only Indian food, if that makes sense. The cups, sugar containers, utensils, plates, etc, all said 'diner' to me; only that the food and smells were totally exotic. And the food is the kind of solid, 'everything is good' that you can consistently expect.   Besides the food, our servers were attentive, the place was clean, and there was a fun vibe with lots of couples and families enjoying snacks and meals.  Overall, a great experience and a place I will return to."}
{"text":"Ahh this is just an iconic place in Toronto, not for the regular palate as flavours are strong and somewhat spicy but never disappointing! Yes maybe a tad too greasy but what's Pakistanese food without grease? Probably one of my favourites spots in the city when in need of a nice fix"}
{"text":"Long wait times as the place is so busy during the summer even with their outdoor setup (covered).  The lady apologized for the wait time as we were waiting for the food to arrive. Which I thought was very nice for a place that busy to make every customer feel at home.  Very large two storey Pakistani restaurant. Never tried their famous buffet though. Always ordered off the menu.  Food is so so fresh lots of flavor, the place smells really nice. Little too noisy but its part of the experience. The tuk tuk and the rickshaw parked out side on the busy street for snapping photos gives you that south Asian feel.  Will visit during next summer again!!!"}
{"text":"Long wait times. Very poor coordination between the waiters and the receptionist. Waiting for 45 mins for 3 people and yet no signs of table. That's okay if the tables are really occupied, but it's not. We could see multiple tables empty inside, outside and the tents too. Will never go there."}
{"text":"Worsttttttt worsttttt restaurant in the history of mankind. Over-hyped and over-rated only by whites,  CBCDs ( Canadian born CONFUSED desis) (i said confused desis though I am Canadian, but I am not confused) and non-Lahori people who do not know what Lahori food is all about. The restaurant has the name Lahore , but it is an insult to Lahore and Lahori food. Lahori food is supposed to be flavorful  and full of aroma which this place's food lacks altogether.  Horrible. Biryani rice are as hard as nails, burned but undercooked tikka and kababs, Nihari is just plain beef stew not worth calling Nihari, Haleem is mostly just Daal and not haleem flavour. Extremely slowwwwwwww service with horrible wait time. All jammed packed with people who only know BUTTER CHICKEN is a Pakistani food. Lemme get t h is straight BUTTER CHICKEN IS NOT LAHORI OR PAKISTANI ITEM. Again butter chicken isn't a caliber to grade a restaurant.  Our $85 bucks were wasted. We would never go again. You dont need to pay $85 something dollars for lame food that is served in disposable plates and cutlery. Just do a reasearch on this page and you will know that all the so called good reviews were done by whites and mostly non-desi people and all of them are bragging about freaking butter chicken. Phhewwwww big deal.  See my review about Shaheen Tikka restaurant if you are interested."}
{"text":"The service of this place turned me off immediately, and the look of it. Everything was run down, seemed like staff didn't care. Looked over priced for getting plastic cutlery and the lot. The bathrooms were definitely not attended on a daily basis.   Left before i could even order i was so put off and got gautama which has outstanding food and service!"}
{"text":"I had such an amazing time here with my group of friends! I recommend eating outside. I love the decorations and the christmas lights.  The service was fast and friendly, and the food tasted great.  The menu accommodates the vegan diet, so I was pleased about that."}
{"text":"This place has been under construction for over a decade but despite the appearance they are always packed. They have the best butter chicken, naan & aloo gobi in little India. They will make anything extra spicy if you ask. They are more than willing to explain everything when you have cautious vegetarians in your group."}
{"text":"The food: we ordered the lamb biryani, butter chicken, garlic naan, and beef seekh kebob. Bottom line everything was amazing. The best biryani I've ever had. Perfect balance of spices, with the tender-est lamb meat.   Service: place is super busy, waiters are always hustling so don't expect attentive waiters. BUT waiters and front staff are very nice and helpful.  We would definitely recommend people to try this place."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of this place! Delicious food, lots of seating and free parking - what more could you want? It's probably the most popular restaurant on Gerrard St so try to have reservations if you're going on busy days, otherwise you'll wait a while for a seat."}
{"text":"Best indian restaurant I've been to in the city.  Service has gotten much slower since the founding owner passed away and waitstaff were subsequently cut.  Still an excellent restaurant with great food. Spicy curries, delicious naan, and great kebabs.  I recommend the butter chicken, lamb kebab, and garlic naan.  All dishes are really, really heavy. Expect to leave feeling 5-10 pounds heavier."}
{"text":"Definitely a little gem on gerrard street. Came in on a Saturday night and they were packed. Their concept of how to order food was quite street forward. Once your table is ready you are given a white board... you go through the menu of what you want, write it down on the white board and hand it to either of the two cashiers near the kitchen. Then similar to Panera, you get a number sign and when your food is ready, they deliver it to your table. Menu is not overly extensive but had a good amount of options from middle eastern food to south asian food (palak paneer and alo gobi etc).  We decided to try their briyani because everyone that recommended us to this place definitely  recommended their Briyani. We choose the chicken briyani and the portion size is huge. Definitely can feed 3 -4  people! very flavourful and filled with lots of chicken pieces. There are two different sauces that you can use in your meal, one is kind of yogurt base and the other is a sweet/spicy chutney.  We also decided on the classic indian golgapi .. that was delicious!!!! Best i think we've ever had, and my fiance who is indian said the same!!! They stuffed these little deep fry balls with onions, chicken peas, cilantro, potatoes and different chutney and yogurt and then this green/brown water is given to pour ontop. so delicious and refreshing.. a little expensive at 8.99 for 10 pieces (since no meat) but it takes a lot of effort to make this dish so we justified it was worth it.  We also ordered the lamb kabob and that was so flavourful and delish. It comes out on a sizzling plate and it was just so so good. I am definitely going back to try the chicken one! We also tried the Hara chicken and that was good too.. they used thighs for this dish and the spices were so flavourful. the only downfall to it is all the oil you see at the end of this plate once all the chicken is eaten! but nonetheless worth it for the flavour.  Can't wait to return to try other dishes here! But definitely go at non prime times because they take about 45 minutes to serve your meal!!!"}
{"text":"Lahore Tikka House at 1365 Gerrard St. E. is arguably the best (North) Indian #food in Toronto. Owner, Alnoor Sayani has the right idea at the right price. The Chicken Tikka Masala, Karahi Gosht (lamb), and Butter Naan were flavourful and spicy and definitely our favourites. It's very busy on the weekends and great for people watching. The outdoor seating is open in the summer. Try the pink Kashmiri tea, flavoured with Saffron instead of coffee (message me for pics). The only drawback is your clothing and hair will smell like you hung out all day in an East Indian kitchen, but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Our entire family loves it so much that my 9y old son wanted to write this review:  \"This place is perfect! First they have incredible food.   Everyone is nice there.   It's a big restaurant, so they serve the food quicker because there is a lot of people working there.   The ribs are perfectly seasoned\""}
{"text":"Lahore Tikka House is in the middle of the Indian village. The food is Halal Pakistani cuisine..  ...a bit of an obscure treat... The place was pretty busy... The layout is a bit odd.  There is an area with front area with a register, then a hallway that went down the middle of two trailers that you ate in. Each trailer had plastic chairs/tables. you sat down, looked at the menu, then went back to the register to order. (or the more experienced probably just order then sit down?). we were the only white people, which was a good sign I suppose. Despite being in the Indian area, it felt pretty far off the beaten path.  For food we ordered some samosas (good, pretty standard), a chick pea dish that they highly recommended Chana Masala. It was great. A few kabab (beef and lamb) that were excellent.. And butter chicken. Again, excellent. a friendly guy walked around offering roasted chili peppers off of a stick, I felt obligated to try one and wowsa regretted that!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Lahore Tikka House after a quick google search for Pakistani restaurants.   Summed up:  1. The portions were small  and over priced 2. The Chicken tikka was dry and pathetic  Waiters were seen cleaning tables by wiping them with their hands and rubbing dirty garbage cans on seats and tables.   The food is not  what it is hyped up to be. Service is haphazard. The write your order on the whiteboard concept is lame."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit here as me and my fellow yelpers descended upon LTH for some good pakistani grub. We sat out in the outdoor patio which was jovially decorated with sari's and strings of christmas lights. Now the food was very good, the kebabs had wonderful spicing, the biryani portions were huge and the vegetable mixed plate though a tad greasy was delicious and flavourful. Although the sauce was tasty in our butter chicken/chicken tikka plates I found it to be skimpy in the meat department. Our server was friendly and the food was plopped down on our tables quickly.   This is a great place for groups, I saw various faces here enjoying dinner although those not looking for an off-the-wall experience may have some reservations about the place. For example the food and drinks are served in styrofoam containers. Additionally the ordering system is odd, you fill out the paper menu and bring it to the front desk. But if you're willing to abide by these quirks and you're looking for food that's tasty, smoky and spicy this is worth a look."}
{"text":"I would never go back again. We had a big event for a birthday and ordered food in advance for it.  Incredibly excited for the celebration and good food, however what followed was just the opposite. Everyone who ate the food became violently ill (10+ people). When the restaurant was contacted and informed, they didn't apologize and instead claimed \"we didn't sound sick\" adding further insult to injury, they advised the food only lasts two hours and that they knew the food had been sitting for a while before the scheduled pickup time. Who knowingly hands over food that has gone bad?!     This is appalling.  Never ever order take out from Lahore Tikka house.  There is no concern for your well-being!  Bad and unprofessional service."}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favourite places to eat in the whole city. It might not be the fanciest place, but it has absolutely phenomenal Indian/Pakistani food.  When you show up, you really feel like you are going to a different part of the world.  This might sound strange, but I particularly like to go in the warm months when they set up a tent on the tilted parking lot beside the restaurant. There is something about this setting that just works.  Everything has so much flavour. You cannot go wrong ordering. The skewers of meat and different kinds of naan bread are out of this world.   Aside from the mango lassies, I always get the pink and tasty chai tea and house made kulfi that is some sort of frozen dairy treat on a stick."}
{"text":"I don't need to over explain myself to make my point. This place is phenomenal. Simply put. You can't afford to miss it if you live in Toronto. Now.... Word of caution - you'll have to shower from head to toes and throw all your clothes in the washing machine after eating here. Even your urine will smell of spice, don't say I didn't warn you.  A true gem of Toronto's culinary scene."}
{"text":"Me and my family were in Canada just for vacation in Niagara Falls, so we decided to drive to toronto from there. As we drove we came across this place which just stood out because of the rickshaws that stood outside and the architecture of this restaurant which just screamed Pakistani. To order we had to write down what we wanted to order on a whiteboard with a marker which was cool and I really loved that idea. The food was amazing and it reminded me of the old traditions of Pakistan. We ordered Kashmiri chai too, which was too salty but overall the food was really good. I just didn't like the environment\neighborhood where this restaurant is located because of the cracked and broken streets/houses. The whole street in that area is dedicated to Pakistan/Indian culture but it does need some renovation. Since being a New Yorker, it all just looked weird to me."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in little India.  Very consistent, a tad on the pricey side if you are with people who want a variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Before coming here I had really mixed reviews from (Indian) friends. Some said it was awesome and some said the atmosphere is not worth the money. So I expected the worst.   I was pleasantly surprised. On a Friday night it's hard to miss the glowing building and highly decorated 'patio'. It was late, 9pm, and was really busy but they were able to accommodate 15 of us.   This \"patio\" is a sari decorated outspurt of the restaurant , basically their parking lot. But it does not feel like such thing. You've been transported to another world here.   Yes,  hey have foam cups and paper plates but it's more sanitary ad we dint mind at all.   They give you a menu, and you go and order at the cash. They will give you a number. With such a big group, we split our order into 3 and just went up in turn. There was a lady there that also helped some of us out.   Take the number back to your table, and wait, briefly for food.   At first I was surprised at the small quantity for $ value, but was reminded that it quite filling.  So for 4 people we got - Butter Chicken $12 - Lamb Gorhst $11 (lamb in a sort of spicy sauce) - 3 orders of naan - Lamb kebobs ($2,25 each) they were quite small not worth it really - 2 orders of Biyrani (lamb and chicken) which was filling and flavourful - beef ribs - really good when not over cooked. Enough to share   Our bill came to $20 a person, including a generous tip.   There's tons of wait staff here and they were all really friendly. At one point, instead of going up to order more food, our server helped me order it from the table - it was nice and we made it worth his while.   Yum"}
{"text":"Let's start with the pluses...  It's an authentic experience.  The rickshaw and the decor are good photo props. And it has it's own limited free parking! The majority of staff and management are eager to offer you a positive experience. As for the food, there are definite hit and miss items,  unfortunately more of the latter. Hit: Lahori tikka kabob, nihari, naan not bad if they give it fresh rather than remicrowaved one, FIRNI/KHEER(small in portion but good value at $1.49 so order several-sweet and rich). MISS: biriyani(a complete stretch of the imagination cause its a curried rice with package spices,  so not tastey) masala daal was another fail. And order a sweet drink cause the salt levels are a bit hight for even fast food levels.   Bon appetit"}
{"text":"The food at this place is at best, mediocre. I guess it satisfies the inexperienced palates of Canadians but for someone who has grown up eating familiar Pakistani dishes such as Karahi Chicken - cooked with respectable authenticity - I was grossly disappointed with the quality of the food.  That is not even the worst part of my experience. 3 of my colleagues and I, visited this place for the first time this afternoon for lunch and we ordered Butter Chicken, and the forementioned Karahi Chicken. When the dishes arrived we were shocked by: a) the fact that there were ONLY 4 tiny pieces of chicken in a pool of gravy & b) 5 equally tiny pieces of Karahi Chicken with 2 pieces being bones with no meat at all.  One of us immediately informed the waiter about the quantity of butter chicken, and with a confused expression he headed back to get more. When 'more' finally arrived we were astounded to now see -  wait for it...- a total of only 5 tiny pieces of chicken. We paid an outrageous $58 in total to RATION out 8 pieces of chicken along with the meager portion of rice - served on a paper plate - amongst the four of us.  This is clearly the most ridiculously atrocious dining experience I've ever had. If you think that the food here is great, sacrifice some $ for gas and pay a visit to Mississauga or Scarborough where you will find exponentially better food at much more reasonable prices! I'll be more than willing to throw some names if you message me..."}
{"text":"Food is super tasty and services is also courteous and fairly fast. Place is always busy but especially busy on weekends. Gerrard St is shady Indian area but this restaurant is true star!! Go as many times as you can"}
{"text":"Very good roti and naan with the dishes. We ordered the house special birth animal, it was incredible! The tandoori chicken was flavorful. And the chick pea dish was great.   Service was friendly with a pretty interesting interior decor. Would be an interesting visit at night in the summer. Would come back again to try more."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go to get the worst food poisoning you will likely ever experience. The food is not that good but buyer be warned. You will get sick eating here."}
{"text":"The biryani was great. The bihari kabobs and naan were amazing. The lahori kulfi was the best I've ever had, even better than the ones I have had in Lahore. I don't particularly like the ambiance. Its a big place, seems like a former car garage/mechanic shop turned into a restaurant..it has an interesting feel to it.  I choose food over ambiance most days so I would definitely go here again and again.  I highly recommend this restaurant. There was a reason why it was on the food network!"}
{"text":"OMG keep away and save your money, this is fatty, greasy, drowning in oil food and high prices for dishes swimming in oil.  I would give them a minus 10 star,. this place needs to be busted...  I felt like we were robbed.  City Food Inspectors should be checking this establishment and checking what low quality food they are serving to the public.  Pls be warned."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!  Have never been much pleased with thier customer service but now it went from bad to unbearable.    We were a group of 16 and agreed to wait for half an hour. When they finally called us a lady (think she is one of the owner) told us that each one of us had to be there to be seated and then decided to count us. I dnt understand how or why would we lie about the number of people eating!! And the way she was behaving it was soooo rude.    When she took us to the table it was for 10 people! We were 16!! She showed us 4 more chair of which two were already occupied. The couple there just started. Thier foods were mostly untouched.   When we asked she said we had to wait there for the couple to finish. So basically she was telling us to stand beside total stranger and wait for them finish thier dinner. WHAT!!!. Even the server for that section was embarrassed. But the owner/hostess kept making faces. SO RUDE!!!  Walked out and never returning.   If there was a way to give negative star I would do it. A lot of amazing places on Gerrard for indian/Pakistani food. I strongly suggest avoiding this one."}
{"text":"Drove into Toronto after 4 hours and stopped by for lunch. There is no parking at this place. Need to drive in side streets and walk 5 min in rain to get in. Had stopped here 7 years ago. Lot has changed. Outdoor area was closed. Menu looked much smaller. Ordered pani pori which was decent. Beef curry was probably best dish among things we ordered. Both the tikka dishes (seekh kabob  and chicken tikka) were very bland. No spices were to be found on these. These could have been from KFC. Ruined the taste for this place forever. Kulfi were decent. Drinks were warm. It's not done place I would visit again. Heard Patna Kabob is much better and more authentic Pakistani food. For a place called tikka house, did not live up to have even decent tikka. Bill was a surprise with $21 for chicken tikka which probably be called donation."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic.  Tied for first place of all the Indian food I've ever had in my life (tied with the Taj Mahal Palace in the Chungking Mansions in Hong Kong).  The downside is that it is a little frenetic in here, because everyone knows it is good and is willing to put up with a lot of hustle and bustle."}

{"text":"Best food in the entire city.  For two people here is what you need. . .   - 2 lamb kebobs - 1 boneless chicken biryani  - 2 garlic naans - 1 change of clothes"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Probably the best butter & garlic naan I've had. The kababs arrived sizzling on the plate and was very yummy and tender. We ordered the veggie combo sizzler which was a little too much in the portion compared to their other dishes, but also delicious nonetheless. Service was excellent, we asked about the pani puri's and the host explained and let us try some on the house."}
{"text":"They have decent food. Just stick with tikka and chicken tikka masala. If you don't mind excess Pudina (mint) then try the sish kebab. A bit crowded maybe because I went on Saturday; however the staffs are extremely friendly and polite."}
{"text":"These guys aren't just cooks, this level of cooking is genius artistry.  I've had Indian, Pakistani and Afghani food all over the world - New Delhi, Agra, Lucknow, Lahore, 10th Arrondissement, Southall, Whitechapel, Murray Hill aka Curry Hill etc. and very few approach the level of Lahore Tikka House.  The complexity of the spices, curries, meats etc is a cut above the rest.  You can actually taste multiple levels and nuances of spice to their food.  Then they compliment it with grilled onion, ginger, mint etc.  The composition of flavors is much more sophisticated than your average Indian restaurant.  Of course since it's a Pakistani establishment the kebabs are on point.  Rivaled only by Tayyabs in London in my opinion.  This place is a true gem and deserves to be on the map for some of the best south Asian cuisine in the world."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Pakistani places I have been to! We ordered the butter chicken and nihari! Please don't go home without ordering these dishes. The nihari OH MY GOD! I can't seem to talk about it without salivating. The butter chicken was very tender and juicy not dry or chewy at all loved every bit of it! The service we got from our waiter was moderate he wasn't like disappeared all the time he did care about us. But being the desi restaurant it is service is not primary concern it's literally like you're in Pakistan or any southeast Asian country where you go to a place for food not service"}
{"text":"Service was real nice and polite. Food was very good even if portions were small. The tent was over an inclined road. That was annoying . Prices  are a bit high. Also, Wi-fi has a password. It should be open access.  Overall, an excellent experience you should go here."}
{"text":"This place used to be absolutely amazing. The food was some of the best food I've had, and definitely the best Pakistani food. However, this was BEFORE, but since 2014 they seem to have changed owners. The food is terrible, they serve less of it, and the prices are more expensive. It's disappointing because this place used to be awesome. If you've gone here before 2014, don't come again as it's NOT the same delicious place that once was."}
{"text":"HEALTH HAZARD! ENDED UP AT THE HOSPITAL! BROKEN FOOT! The place is unsafe, the pavement is uneven and the manager is rude. We went to dine here on the night of July 13th and I was seriously injured by a pot hole in the patio floor -- ended up spending the night at the hospital. The hole had been covered with by a rug so I was unable to see it. I tripped over it and fell into the hole which had dirty water in it. The manager was more concerned about the legal rights of the restaurant rather than my personal safety, she was even trying to force me to sign a waiver. Not to mention that she was well aware of the hole being covered with by a rug and was giving me attitude as we were trying to discuss the situation. I ended up being taken to the hospital for my leg as my injury was quite severe. Furthermore, the restaurant is unsanitary as there is one kitchen that is outside--- its an open kitchen, posing the question as to how sanitary the food is. Most of all the customer service is absolutely horrible, never in my life have I been so insulted by a manager - the night ended off with her telling us to never come back and we will NEVER be coming back. Dine there at your own risk, I don't understand how the patio area passed inspection or how the restaurant is still open with all the food and safety violations. I have and will continue to complain to the city as this is absolutely absurd and dangerous not only to me but to the safety and health of the public."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome.   I came here yesterday in a group of 3, looking for some pakistani noms.  We decided to come here, because we all agreed it was some of the best.  Note: The interior may be tacky, and the seating may be shitty, but who cares.  We ordered:  1. The Lamb Chops - OMG SUPERB. DELICIOUS. SOOO MEATY. SOOO BEAUTIFUL.  2. The Tandoori Chicken - Really really well done. You could tell the meat had been marinating for days.   3. The Butter Chicken - So thick, and juicy. While I was trying to wrap my naan around the piece, it slipped out of my hand and onto the floor. I almost cried.  4. The Palak Paneer - A white person favourite. I loved it. It was good. Not a lot of spice though.  5. The Naan - so fresh, hot and buttery. Mmmm. We had to double our order half way through.   Final Verdict: A M A Z I N G."}
{"text":"definitely one of my favorite places in the city. the wait can be kind of nuts on friday night but it's a pretty big place and we always get seated fairly fast.  the flavor, the taste, the portions are all fantastic! i often get a couple of kabobs, lamb gosht, and beef biryani. love it! it's a bit out of my way but it's always worth it to travel there.   the restaurant is a bit dated and service is hit or miss - food quality makes up for it"}
{"text":"Authentic and tasty. Super fast service. Crap furniture. And it ain't as cheap as I remember."}
{"text":"This place transported me back to Queens NY. This Pakistani Indian cuisine is amazing and the best part they don't over oil or salt the food. We had the Karachi lamb, Karachi chicken, chicken Tikka along with kababs. I can't wait to come back to Toronto."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for 10 years now and the service and quality of food has gone down. Before the previous owner had passed away, the service was great and quality of food was just wow. Recently, we decided to dine in for a special occasion and it was just awful. There were 10 of us and we had ordered something different. We ordered our usual biryani, paneer tikka masala, ribs, chaat. The biryani was not bad, nothing to complain about there. The ribs were cold and we had to return them. The paneer tikka masala was absolutely  the worst dish, I have never been so disappointed. The dish is supposed to have cubes of paneer (cottage cheese) however there were 2 paneer pieces and the rest was red peppers to fool the customer. I cannot believe this.   I live in the neighbourhood and a few months ago I decided to pick up some food for take out. I was pushing a stroller and no one came to help me through the doors and the first thing they said to me was \" ma'am can you leave your stroller in the stroller area?\" I hate their new policy of no strollers allowed. This makes no sense because their restaurant is so big and the stroller wouldn't be in anyone's way and as well the place is not an elegant place, it wouldn't ruin the ambience or environment of the restaurant.  I'm assuming the spouse runs the restaurant now. You are not doing a good job. Go back to the old times."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little kid and have never had a bad experience. Always get seated immediately, food takes the time it should and always have great customer service. Pani puri & chicken tikka are deff my faves here. So delicious ~~"}
{"text":"Oh how I go slightly insane for their curry beef. Portion sizes are on the smaller side but with a bang and pop in each bite I will gladly revisit."}
{"text":"went to Lahore Tikka with a friend who had been before, jsut not value for money when you factor in the ambience, paper plates, plastic cutlery, and food cooked th eday before. Lunch for two was over $35.00 not what I expected to pay."}
{"text":"Incredible incredible food, very ethnic casual atmosphere, communal seating. Great place to take a big group of friends for lunch or dinner. Reasonable prices, average service."}
{"text":"I was reading the other reviews and trying to figure out why this place is only a 3.5 star and it seems that most people complain about the disposable utensils, the smell that is left on our clothing and the unreadable menus, I won't dispute those things but rather say they add to the experience. Whenever I come back to Toronto I make a point to eat here, if I stick to what I know is great I am always super happy. There kebabs, naan and lamb are awesome, butter chicken is great, the biryani has been hit or miss but overall I am a big fan of those dishes. A big plus is that the staff remember me and always treat with me a great deal of respect.   I wouldn't go here if you are looking for fancy dining, or going somewhere afterwards where the smell of spice will be offensive or annoying but if you are looking for a good food experience and can tolerate the environment it is a great place."}
{"text":"We ordered so much food and everything tasted great. Butter chicken, ribs, goat and kabob. Was very filling and looked amazing. Would highly recommend trying Lahore out."}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place!  We came here last night with friends so they could experience the joy of Lahore Tikka House. The last time my husband and I were here, we were eating in trailers... now we were seated in the new building.  Not knowing what to expect, I was afraid that the building would spoil the charm of this wonderful Pakistani restaurant but to my surprise (and joy!), it hasn't at all! It truly is quite the experience eating here.  The new building is spacious and open with somewhat of a 'market' feel to it... it's quite literally, a roof over your head. You still feel very much connected to the outside but that could possibly be because one wall is completely open to, what I can only think to call, the asphalt dining area.  We devoured:  Two Lamb Kabob/Chicken Tikka Rice - $12.95 Aloo Gobi - $8.50 Lahori Beef Kabob - $2.35 (each) Chicken Tikka Masala - $12.25 Chana Masala - $8.35 Garlic Naan - $2.25 (each) Butter Naan - $1.99 (each)  First off, the naan has got to be the best I've ever tasted! It's soft and chewy and perfect for wiping up all the left over sauces on your plate. So delicious.  All of the meat was seasoned beautifully and cooked to perfection. The rice that came with the lamb kabobs was incredible and there was certainly plenty enough for sharing.  Our vegetarian dishes did not disappoint either! I knew before I stepped in the restaurant that I was having their Aloo Gobi again and it was just as fantastic as I remembered! The Chana Masala was ordered 'hot' and had a pleasant heat to it; not the kind that burns your taste-buds but rather leaves your lips tingling with wonder.  All of the staff at this restaurant aim to please and ensure that your dining experience is one to remember. I was glad that we arrived when we did (6:30ish) because by the time we left, they were lined up down the street... of course, that might have had something to do with Eid al-Fitr as well. ;)"}

{"text":"Always the best kebobs and lamb chops!"}
{"text":"I don't know Indian/Pakistani cuisine well enough to praise or diss the food too much here, but the atmosphere is definitely cool, especially if you're an out of towner posing for an \"ethnic\" experience.  Walking in the tent/patio they use for outdoor seating, I heard one man say that \"this is just like how it is eating in India\" and that was good nuff for me.  The food is on the oily side and not a lot of chicken in the chicken dish, but that's prob what makes it more authentic :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Pakistani food, you would probably want to look for something else. Mediocre at best. The food is dumbed down to please the broader audience and is definitely not as spicy as Pakistani cuisine usually is.  The naan is one of the only good thing here.  Curries are cooked separately and the meat is added later, you could tell while eating that there is a mismatch.  Yes the ambiance is good and what not, but nothing is more important than the food, which is meh."}
{"text":"I loveee indian/pakistani food. But there is something so unique about this place, it feels as if you are in your grandparents home. The amount of grease,spice,atmosphere. Its just beautiful. Everyone's is there to enjoy food. If you are in to looks u will get disappointed, but dont get me wrong its clean...."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Lahore Tikka House for the past 15 years. It's one of those places we take company to, and it's consistently good. My personal preferences are the lamb karahi, chicken seekh kabobs, butter chicken, the beef biryani and garlic naan.  I myself am Indian and am often picky about Indian food because I know and want it to taste a certain way. Lahore Tikka House comes the closest to my mom and grandma's cooking. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that they use more oil then I'd personally prefer, but still, well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. Let me save you some time. BEEF RIBS, BEEF RIBS, AND MORE BEEF RIBS. Get some lamb chops with it. Thats it. Thank me later. What a gem of a place."}
{"text":"Aweful service. I tried to order from them for our company. Talked to the owner. She confirmed my order and cancelled two days before the event. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"This place is a dive but don't let the crummy  decor and furniture deter you from going to this restaurant. I usually try some basics/staples on my first trip. Chicken Tikka and Butter chicken w/naan were tasty"}
{"text":"Authentic as it gets... don't let the uncompleted renovations and plastic cutlery fool you - Lahore hits the spot and serves up fresh Indian dishes."}
{"text":"Very, very delicious food. What we appreciated was that while there was a bit of heat to the dishes it didn't over power the flavor. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, which came tender, tangy, creamy. The best Chicken Tikka we've ever had. We also had the Sizzling Beef Kebabs and the Trio of Veggie curries, accompanied by naan and rice.   While some may be  turned off by it's ambiance, I think it builds character and authenticity. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. We had a great time and enjoyed what was probably our best meal in Toronto."}
{"text":"I regret not having the chance to eat at this well-known restaurant when it was just a bunch of trailers. I do remember that it took them forever to complete the permanent building that it now resides in.  If the dim and wildly decorated atmosphere, and cheap shitty patio-grade plastic furniture is supposed to make you feel like you're eating at a bustling streetside shack restaurant somewhere in Pakistan or India or whereabouts, then I guess that's the kind of feeling Lahore Tikka House is trying to bring to this side of Toronto.  For the uninitiated, the way the place operates is confusing. They have servers that bring your food to you, take drink orders and such. But you have to make your food order at the cashier stationed at the back, like a fast food joint, who will then hand you a table number to take back to your table. Sometimes if you want more food, servers may take orders from your table. The crew are quite shipshape though, and the constant walking-in-and-out of the kitchen area wafts in a lot of aromas.  The plastic furniture, utensils, and water served in styrofoam cups makes you scratch your head over whether you're in the right place for good food, or are you merely in a cheap fast food box (and I really wish they do away with using disposable materials to serve their stuff in).  Then the steaming hot food arrives and you forget that the place seems so ghetto at first impression. They make good soft naan (though the garlic naan was more like a greasy slop), and a lot of their meals are loaded with hot spiciness. The lamb kebobs were savoury. And the brain masala? Indescribable!  There is an identity crisis in the way the restaurant runs. But it is sure a hilarious dining experience in a business that continues to thrive despite the condition that the Little India neighbourhood is at right now.  {TTC: 506 streetcar to Highfield Road. Look for on the south side a large building with a motor rickshaw parked out front.}"}
{"text":"Love this place - the biryani is amazing and their brain masala is sooo tasty (creamy and choked full of flavour . Definitely get their garlic naan - it`s the perfect complement to an amazing meal.   But I always feel guilty eating at this place because of the amount of oil they use - some of the dishes come with their own layer of oil on top :)   Also be prepared to come out smelling like the kitchen - they need to improve their ventilation!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place as it is known as the best Indian resto on Gerard St. I was a little disappointed. The food was extremely greasy, the portions were small for what they were charging, and the waiters were completely clueless and aloof. There are better restos on Gerard St. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"The food is yummy (but greasy!) here...definitely not for the faint of heart (pun intended!).  Don`t expect anything fancy here - you get paper plates/cups/utensils and have to go to the front of the restaurant to place your order and then pay.  I will give the food 4 stars b/c I love the naan and lamb kebobs,,,but for everything else 3 stars,  I don`t feel like I have to stand in line to order and pay in a sit down restaurant...but the kitsch of the place brings me back time and again (especially once my arteries declog!)   It's pretty cheap - 2 people can eat (with leftovers!!) for under $35!  not bad not bad."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars* We ordered take out~ it was pretty delish.  The butter chicken was pretty greasy, but still good.  We ordered a sampler platter, yummy, but presentation even in a take out box could have been improved.  We also had the chicken biryani ~ this was quite tasty, but it was a dry biryani.  We parked on the street, but they do seem to have a parking lot."}
{"text":"Omg! Best place to eat desi food in Toronto. No other place can even come remotely close to this place. Wow their briyani. It's just outrageous. It is soooo good. Ideally 1 large briyani should be sufficient for 2 adults but it so good that u just cannot stop. I don't like the sides(curd like thing and some tomato sauce thing) that come with the briyani though. Butter chicken is so delicious too. Most importantly it is not sweet here. Their kebabs and golgappas are delicious as well. This is a place where I will just close my eyes and choose from the menu. No second thoughts. Will come again and again and again!"}
{"text":"It is a Must to go place when in Toronto,or new to Toronto  If menu had more options it would be better,also the ambience is a little weird  Having a pakistani ambience doesn't mean you have to make it uncomfortably desi (the tables and the chair for examples) I felt like the ambience made me feel as if it's dirty. Food is amazing.will go again for sure"}
{"text":"My experience with Indian food is not very extensive - I've had Palak Paneer before without actually knowing what it was so my ordering tactic at this place was to scream I WANT THE GREEN OILY STUFF WITH THE WHITE PIECES!!! into my friends' ears.  I've only recently introduced spicy food to my belly so needless to say, I'm not Abbas.   I live at Yonge and Finch so booking it all the way to little India should be well worth it! The exterior/interior reminds me of an Indian movie (yeah, they're big in Ukraine. waddup). There's even some kind of princess carriage outside if you wanna take pictures or entertain the little ones :)  We sat in the hut part, it was a very \"outdoor-tent-wedding/birthday/BBQ\" type of feeling - I loved it!  They bring you salad, which is basically coarsely chopped tomatoes, lettuce, carrots, etc. and two dressings/sauces - one SUPER spicy and one sour cream based (I think...?). You can order as much of the salad as you want - take advantage.  TIP: the sour cream sauce helps calm your mouth if you overdo it with the spicy one.    We ordered (thank you Abbas' , I wouldn't have remembered...) 1. The Lamb Chops - dry-ish and salty. It was a different taste because i'm used to the way my parents make these (juicier). But i like salty - some people don't. give it a try!.  2. The Tandoori Chicken - yuuummmmyyyyy!!!!! so delicious, hot and fresh and sorta spicy - love as first bite. 3. The Butter Chicken - very oily, spicy and delicious 4. The Palak Paneer - oily, not as spicy as I expected but verryyyy good. Wrap dat Naan around it! 5. The Naan - I LOVE BUTTER I LOVE BUTTER I LOVE BUTTER. did i mention...that I love butter? It was very buttery, warm and delicious.  So, in conclusion - it was yummy. A bit pricey... for everything we paid around $60, I don't know if this is cheap for Indian food but I was expecting a bit of a lower price tag....  JOKE: Hear about the cannibal in an Indian restaurant? He ate his Nan.   hehehe.....xoxo"}
{"text":"The beef curry was good. Naan was great.  Biryani lacked any flavour (just greasy rice) and butter chicken was sour and unappealing.   Okay experience to take out of towners but don't go for the food."}
{"text":"Been coming here since 2003 when it was a Converted KFC.  I'm a big fan.  The lamb and beef kebabs are awesome.  The beef ribs and Afghani chicken very good.  All the above come on sizzling plates. Tawa Keema mutter and chicken tikka masala also great.  Butter till naan, yes.  Take the Lahori Kulfi for desert.  Food is very authentic Pakistani/south Asian.  It's a really good place to come with many people and take many dishes to split and sample.  Very unique.  People I've taken from out of town, always want to go back.  Things that I miss - paper plates (it was like being at a picnic), the little mini salad that used to come for free (bring it back!), the perpetual construction and reconstruction, the lighted summer tent, and legendary owner Alnoor, may he rest in peace."}
{"text":"now i dont have much experience with pakistani food, but this place met all expectations surrounding it.  we'd pass by all the time, seeing people on this makeshift patio, sitting around simple white tables, eating on paper plates, looking generally quite festive.  so finally on a hot summer day we strolled in, were cordially ushered to a table, given menus and asked whether wed like veggie or meat samosas.  those were the apps.  those were great.  the food had a nice spicy kick to it that was not overwhelming, and everything was fresh and flavourful.  i had the Karahi Gosht (Lamb) and we shared the combo sizzler which is a combo of the following different vegetable dishes: Tarka Dal (lentils), Aloo Gobi (Cauliflower & Potato), Chana Masala (Chick Peas) and Palak (Spinach).    it was that type of thing where you are enjoying yourself so much, and the food is so good, youll go against your better judgement and contine stuffing your face when you already can feel that your full.  if you are particular about ambiance, then take a hike, and far away from this place, so i can enjoy my meal in simple pleasure."}
{"text":"Excellent and well known Pakistani restaurant in the famous Gerrard Street in downtown Toronto.  Punjabi Flair.  They sometimes have an occassional dhol (large drum) player and also a rickshaw for tourists to sit in.  Very festive atmosphere.  Try the sugarcane juice as well."}
{"text":"OMG! Flavours burst in your mouth! Portions are enough for 4 ppl. Staff are friendly and helpful. Always packed, and packed with Indian and Pakistani patrons and their families, which means it's authentic and delicious! Service is fast, too! Food is fresh and hot! Only downfall is they don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Always a hit with the food. All except the butter chicken. Way too sour.  Get there kabobs. This place the only thing they are lacking is the service. Improve the that and five star rating."}
{"text":"It used to be one of the best south asian restaurants in the GTA about 10 years ago. A lot has gone downhill since then:  1. Shorter hours of operations. It used to be open pretty late at night for the student crowd once upon a time. 2. More expensive menu items with lesser quantity. Each item costs $15+. The butter chicken has only 3-4 pieces of chicken in it but costs the same as most other entrees. You can also tell that they just took chicken tikka or chicken tandoori and tossed it into some butter chicken sauce. 3. Extremely oily food recently, you can see thick layers of oil on the butter chicken or biryani dishes. It's a bit disgusting to be honest."}
{"text":"It is the worst place to eat subcontinental cuisine ever! The butter chicken was more of a bitter chicken and the biriyani was super greasy and tasteles! People who have never eaten an authentic butter chicken or biriyani might never know the difference but I could tell immediately that they have a bad cook! Now, when it comes to pricing, I was shocked. They were the most expensive of the entire street....Places like Motimahal & Gautama have a great spread and charge less than Lahore Tikka House...I was so pissed as it was no value for money and I will never go there and recommend others to avoid the place!"}
{"text":"Very good indian food, full of flavour and spices. Got the butter chicken, and a mix vegetable platter. Both were great tasting, and it was cool to see how \"proper\" indian food is made. I even had some dinner left over to bring home.  The naan was good, id recommend saving yourself some money and get the \"plain\" naan. I didnt taste much of the garlic in the garlic naans.   The mango lassi was amazing and really accompanied the food well (and it helped cool your throat from the mild spices). And finally finished it off with the kulfi which was excellent and something new to me as well.   If it was possible, I'd be giving this place a 3.5, because service here is pretty awkward. Once your sat at your table, and decide what you want to eat, you need to walk all the way to the far end of the restaurant and place your order there. And then you have some \"waiters/waitresses\" standing around like hawks. Asking you if everything is ok. Everyone seemed to be so angered as well.  Despite this, the food runners do a great job running the food, and within minutes of ordering your food, it's at your table.  The decor of this is very cool as well. Haven't experienced anything like it in Toronto.  Music was great too.   And just a tip, it seems that they have allot more drinks and items available on the weekend, so if your coming here for a culinary experience come on a saturday.    Great food, great prices"}
{"text":"I have many roots from Pakistan and I have been to Lahore many times - I am deeply proud of my Pakistani roots and it's always great to see those roots celebrated  Yes - Pakistan gets a bad rap for nuclear missiles, but their finest export is actually their food and Lahore Tikka House is proof of that!  I want to reiterate what the other reviews have said, in that, when you walk into this place, you TRULY do feel like you're in Lahore, with its pastel walls, dusty exterior, helpful service, URDU SPOKEN EVERYWHERE LOUDLY, and of course, the wonderful cuisine  Honestly, if you can't fly to Pakistan, visiting this great restaurant is the closest you can get!  Enjoy all!"}
{"text":"The place is a mixed bag for me. The food was okay in terms of taste, the service was excellent, and the interior decor alternated between sketchy and pretty.  I've only eaten Indian-style food a couple of times in my life, and I'm not used to the spices they used or the spiciness. That is the primary basis of my 3-star rating. I don't know if the food was good or bad from an Indian point of view, but personally I didn't enjoy the taste that much.  There are some nice Indian decorations inside the restaurant, especially colourful cloths with shiny sequins. But at the same time the inside is always smoky (due to poor kitchen ventilation? it's food smoke, not cigarettes or anything), and some tables use really cheap flimsy chairs. Also, our food is served on a mix of ceramic plates, heavy iron cooking plates, plastic forks, and styrofoam cups.  The waiters were friendly and super-helpful. They came around frequently (around every 10 minutes?) asking if we need anything (taking plates away, refilling water, etc.). When it came time to pay the bill, we had to go up to the cashier counter (which I think is more organized than paying at the table), and learned that there were no tips (which removes the stress of deciding and calculating an amount). Free Wi-Fi is available, but the signal only covers the first floor."}
{"text":"Best way to describe Lahore Tikka is Indian comfort food. The place is poorly decorated but it sets you to be impressed by the quality and taste of the dishes. Staff is very helpful to suggest dishes if you're a first time visitor."}
{"text":"The chicken biryani was really really good. And the staff was really friendly,  maybe because I spoke in hindi with them :) but having to go up to the counter to order food sucks specially when its soo busy there and the line is soo long."}
{"text":"Entertaining, If nothing else.  The food is good, not fancy but tasty.  Order of Operations is as follows: 1.You're sat in a portable(LED Christmas lights abound), given a menu.  2.You check the boxes on the menu to order your dinner and then bring it back up to the counter where you started. 3.Then in return for your menu you are given a number. . shortly after that dinner arrives!  4.Bring number back up to front when you're finished eating to pay. It's effecitve, quirky. . . maybe a little silly?"}
{"text":"Very good food!! We arrived there and were told there would be a 25 min wait.  We were called up about 10 mins later advising that the upstairs was now open.  The upstairs was for over flow.  The restaurant was full.  This was a clear sign that this might be a good place to eat.  Definitely an interesting way to order - writing your order on a white board.  The wait staff were great and most importantly the food was really good.  We will definitely go back"}
{"text":"A Must when I visit toronto, this odd and unique tent like restaurant is always pleasing, the food is good, spicy, and flavourful, the Main Dishes I prefer are the BBQs, Tikkas, Kabobs, and Lamb, their curries are rich, bold, and good, Naan bread is good, and my best part is the Gol Gappa station, aka Pani Puri, it's a popular street food, crispy shells stuffed with potatoes and chickpeas, and flavoured spiced water, it's an experience, they also bring over grilled green chillis on a metal skewer for all the spice lovers. Lahore Tikka is always a great stop in Toronto! JUST a reminder that if you are dressed up or going somewhere after, think twice as the BBQ and Curry scents will be very noticeable in your clothes,.I recommend it for the Food, and make the best of the atmosphere! I always do!"}
{"text":"Always amazing -this Toronto institution has great vegetarian, fish and meat options. I love their garlic naan. It is also quite child friendly."}
{"text":"My Oh My.....where shall I begin....let me first say Lahore Tikka House is in my all time top 10 list. Remember the first time eating at this dig when the current parking lot housed the tents and tables....that's going back almost a decade....My extended family and I decided to visit Toronto recently and I had told them good things about this restaurant. Upon arriving we were told a 30-45 min wait which was understood as this place was packed full,plus we're a large group. We went crazy on the menu from assorted kebobs, lamb chops, beef ribs, Tikka, pani puri & Hara Chicken....oh that was just the start or \"aka\" the Apps......Everything was on point and brought the carnivores out of us....Damn Human's......After stuffing our faces we took a little break and ordered a chicken briyani, butter chicken and lamb karahi with a few Nans.....once again it was amazing and the curries had great flavor, spice and the biryani just stood out bursting with flavors. Have to say we were  stuffed but still left the places wanting more.....Thus we came the next day and tried the same grilled meats but decided to add Haleem, Nihari and Afghani Chicken..... I mean come on.....can this place do anything wrong!!!!Outstanding and highly highly recommend this place. Some of the negative reviews are from Haters cuz I really cannot understand how someone can find faults in this establishment. And to back that up, The Staff gets the loudest applause as everyone from our waitress, runners, kitchen staff and management all had smiles, held conversations with us and just provided service that is really not expected from South Asian establishments (I'm SA, so I know first hand).... I also had a chat with Gulshan the owner on our second day after our dinner and she comped our pani puri and held some Faloodas on the side for us until our dinner was over. Who does that for you???? She was such a pleasure to chat with and to hear her story you automatically become a fan and are pulling for her success. Kudos Lahore Tikka House and until the next time we head up from NYC....."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. It used to be good before but as it got popular, it's quality went downhill. I used to go there for years and yesterday was the last time I'll ever go. Food took too long and it wasn't even fresh. The chicken platter looked like it had been reheated and was charred on the bottom. Only giving it a 1 star cause it can't give anything lower or else it's a 0 from me. And to top things of, 4 people out of our group of 7 ended up with food poisoning shorty after. What happened to the good old Lahori Tikkah House I remember going to as a child. Never going again, other places like the Makkah restaurant or the King Palace have better food for a cheaper price. Time to find a new go to family restaurant, one that doesn't give you food poisoning."}
{"text":"There's a whole street or two dedicated to the Indian and Pakistani population in Toronto and this is one of the places you will find that has some buzz. The iconic \"Rikshaw\" is parked outside the entrance and that's how you know you're at the right place. Having lived in Pakistan for a bit, I do have a good sense of good info/Pakistani food so I was excited to try it out. The place is covered in the traditional \"shamiyana\" (which is like designed cloth or curtain like thing all around creating an enclosed space). Now if you're going to date the service you would give this place a -2 stars, but again consider the fact that customer service is not a word most Pakistani people are aware of. I had ordered the Chicken Tikka and Beef and Lamb Kabob with nan. It was all very tasty and tender and just how I had remembered it. It was definitely a great experience for me personally and very reminiscent of my trip to Pakistan back in the days."}
{"text":"Warning! you need to know this before u think about eating there   you start off by being served in cheap disposable cups and plates, so you think food will make up for it, right? WRONG!!!  Horrible food, and extremely overpriced !!  Butter chicken was just sour, not creamy or smooth, no flavor   Beef ribs, really thin slices, no juices left, overcooked with a lot of salt, wish they used some steak spice or something, no other flavor   Baryani chicken and lamb, its white rice mixed in chicken or lamb curry full of oil, not Baryani!!  Chicken Karai, chicken was not fully cooked and it just didn't taste right   $60 went to waste, This puts a bad name on Indian/Pakistani food  I have never left a restaurant with food with an empty stomach, i was visiting from Ottawa so i was really hungry, got a pizza on the way to the hotel and enjoyed it  I am not sure how this place has so many good reviews"}
{"text":"Just ok... When exactly are they gonna finish renoing that place and get some heat in there?"}
{"text":"what can i say about this place ,but, \"simply amazing food.\"  i went here with a group of friends on saturday and as soon as i approached the building/complex i was intrigued.  the inside of LTH is a little lacking, but they make up for it with awesome indian/pakistani music.  i was surprised to see such an eclectic mix of patrons, which gave me a hint that the food was going to be good.    now to the good stuff.  i ordered a beef samosa, garlic naan and a karahi gosht.  the five of us split some aloo gobi and chana masla.  the samosa was alright, nothing special to me.  everything else was superb.  the lamb, the naan, the veggy sides, all to my liking.   the spice factor in the food is just enough to make you sweat a little, but not too spicy as to make the food unbearable.  very friendly service and the food came out very quick. everyone else that i went with thoroughly enjoyed what they ordered as well.  this place would get a 5/5 if they had proper cutlery, plates and cups."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Not anything special about this place. They do have great presentation but customer service is zero, food quality is below average. There are better places on the same street"}
{"text":"Have been here half a dozen times at least and always find it so hit or miss. Their bbq ribs have been consistently good. However a lot if their other dishes have either been really good or way to greasy to eat. I know that indian food isn't generally the healthiest but sometimes the bbq stuff other than the ribs is just dripping in oil. Other times it is grilled to perfection, i guess it just depends on the day. I would nit recommend the mango lassi. It seems to sit in their display for most of the night until someone orders it and i have always found it watered down. This place gets crowded fast on weekends and seems to stay crowded all night."}
{"text":"Fun, relaxed, family friendly atmosphere; quick, pleasant service; great food at a very reasonable price.  Wait to be seated; write your order on a small white board and bring it to the front cashier; take take the numbered table stand that the cashier gives you and bring it back to your table; bring the numbered table stand up to the front cashier after your meal to pay your bill."}
{"text":"I've been here ever since they were a small hut and it's nice to see them grow. They charge for salad now. $3 is a bit much if a grip comes in.  The quality of the decor has increased but that's not what people come here for.  Bring back the old paper/parchment type of menus and get rid of the white board. They are trying wirh the decor but getting poorer in other aspects. Food is still good but this place will have a tough time keeping up with their business if they get pricier."}
{"text":"This once used to be my favourite restaurant back in 2007 since it was newly opened. Now as their business and staff grew, their food lost their homemade taste it once had.  Still, a nice place to visit with family once in a while.  I do recommend to be mindful of how much you order because their portion size is fairly large and not go in with too great of an expectation of their service and food."}
{"text":"The Lamb Karahi was full of bones and very little meat. $14 for a bowl of bones is quite expensive. Avoid it."}
{"text":"I smell like keema seekh kebab.. lol  this place has authentic pak food. pak food is famous for their meat dishes, and this place in Gerrard Street has it all..."}
{"text":"Very good food, and better as take out (unless you like playing boxcar bum and eating in a...boxcar.) So far everything has been great. I usually just ask the guy at the desk what I should have for dinner, and so far he hasn't sold me up the \"oops, we made to much of that today, lets get rid of it\" river."}
{"text":"I dont know why this place is hyped so much and has got such good reviews on blogTo and other sites. Maybe they are buying these people. I went there so excited but the food was pathetic. Anyone who has had indian cuisine before should know that this place will dissappoint you. The food has no flavouring and only colour.(look at your fingernails). Indian food leaves a bit of yellowish  colour on your hands due to turmeric but this place was disgusting(they definietly use food colour which isnt good at all!!). The service was horrendous, they were rude and obnoxious. I went there twice giving them the benefit of doubt but even in the secon visit.. I was let down!!! would never recommend this to anyone. The naans are burnt or tooo greasy.. hated it!!!"}
{"text":"The beef kebabs are good. The butter chicken, not so much. The ricksha outside reminded me of the times I wanted to be a fast and furious driver in the city of Bangalore."}
{"text":"Generally speaking this place has decent Tandoori/Indian-Pakistani food. I visit this place whenever I find myself in Gerrard because this place has made a name for itself as the \"go-to\" place for that genre of food in the area.   This place started of as a series of mobile trailers linked together with folding tables and plastic chairs. During this period all the food was served on disposable plates and plastic cutlery. While this really made you feel like you were in India or Pakistan dining, it really wasn't quite acceptable for the price they were/are charging regardless of the quality of the food. Fast forward a few years and the place is now relatively smaller in space, as the main building has completed construction and the ambiance is more \"restaurant like\" now.   The food as I said has generally been good and consistent to a point, although I should mention that the place did take a small turn downhill when the owner unfortunately passed away. I usually order mainly tandoori dishes when I go as I find this to be the best thing to order there. While their Biryanni and curry offerings are good; they aren't what I'm used to (if that makes sense). Furthermore the presentation of the tandoori dishes are nice as they come on a sizzler plate!   In summary I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area, I feel it's one of the better restaurants on Gerrard."}
{"text":"Great kebabs, curries and biryanis. The food was fresh, well cooked and tasted great. I recommend trying their kebabs and tikka."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting...DISGUSTINGLY DELICIOUS!!!!!  When I was preggo and had mad cravings for spiciness....this place hit the spot and then some.  I just love everything about it...the decor, the perpetual renovating look...etc.  This is definitely the most wanna be glamourous hole in the wall there is.    Portions are pretty big...we've ordered So many things off the menu...and never fail...even if it's not our style...I'm always glad that I tried it!  I love love love this place...  Good to bring family and friends and especially kids since it's packed, busy and loud like a good old Chinese restaurant.  They even have a baby change/nursing room (I think) there.  Not the cleanest of all places...but hey come on...how many places actually have these things?...since my little guys been born...I have to say the only place I'm guaranteed this is at the malls.  We have even driven from markham to here to bring for dinner in maple...lol. I know...we're a little fanatic.  Anyhow...a toronto must!"}
{"text":"Great value. A little campy but well worth it for the food."}
{"text":"Lahore tikka house is a fantastic place to eat. Love their decor, mouth watering food and open air sitting arrangement. One thing that i don't like about this restaurant is their service, it's way to slow and mismanage. once i went to lahore tikka house with my family and we ordered BBQ kebabs and our food ordered came without nans and we had to wait 10 mins for the nans.  I would give 4 stars for the food but the service is not worth giving 4 stars."}
{"text":"Well, I'm going to be one of the very few who have given this place a \"meh\" rating.  My GF and I aren't sure what all the hype is about.  We have a long list of better Indian and Pakastani restaurants in the SF Bay Area.  We wanted to like it, since it came with great hype...but just couldn't.  The chicken biryani was so oily and over spicy, that it was impossible to eat.  Plus, the quality of the chicken IMO was less than average.  I'd give it a 1 star, but the people who worked there were so nice and helpful when we told them about the food displeasure.  Sorry, folks."}
{"text":"Going out for dinner is so much more than just going to get someone else to cook for you.   It's about immersing yourself in a particular ambiance and momentarily transporting yourself to another place.     This is as close to a complete experience as you can have.   It's a frenzied environment.  Chaotic at first glance, but surprisingly well organized.  It hits you across all dimensions.   The sounds.   The smells.  The sights.     You grab a seat at a ransack table and are handed paper plates.   You have to go to the counter to place your order.  You wonder what's going to happen.  Then the magic begins.    Minions in uniform start showing up with dishes which you had just ordered.    Thousands of calories of delicious.   Showering your table with riches.    Enough food to feed a village.   Enough sodium to kill a small child.   But it's amazing.   A wonderful glance into one of the most vibrant communities in our wonderful city.    You leave full for days.  And it's the kind of place that you remember."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst organized business I have seen in my entire life. The old man who was making the chat/ gol gappay walked around for at least 10 mins to give the order to the customer but failed. The food was decent we got the butter chicken, chicken biryani, butter naan, papri chat and kulfi not worth 50$. The only reason this place is doing well is because of its charpai and dhabba look and food that is probably better tasting than other restaurants on that street. I didn't go to any of the other restaurants though. A disappointment maybe because we get better food in Devon St., Chicago, USA that's where I'm from."}
{"text":"What better to experience Little India then by going to the most famous restaurant on the strip: Lahore Tikka House.  I've been through this area many times but have never tried to eat at one of the restaurants until today.   FOOD + COST My friend and I shared the: Butter Chicken ($10.25) Karhai Chicken ($9.50) Naan (tandoori) ($1.25 each)  I kind of expected bigger portions but with the Naan, I was super full.  The butter chicken was nothing spectacular but the Karhai Chicken was disappointing.  The reason being was the the Karhai seemed to be all bones! Small, medium and large sized bones with barely any chicken on them.  And to get any chicken, you had to eat very carefully otherwise I felt like you could crack your teeth if you bit too hard.  The Naan, great as always.  They were circular, the size of a plate.  We wanted to order the pink Kashmiri tea ($2.25 or $2.75, can't remember exactly) but they don't prepare it during the week and only prepare it on the weekend. I was disappointed after hearing that news.  The cost of the food appeared to be higher than other restaurants in the area (as per my indian friend).  ENVIRONMENTALLY NOT FRIENDLY I like to be environmentally friendly when I can so when I saw the Styrofoam plates and cups, plastic knives and forks, it kind of gave me the shivers.   WASHROOMS I have a feeling they are still in renovations so the washrooms are a ways away and they are a bit tricky to find them. I feel like you have to walkthrough a garage type room to get to them.    DECOR When you first walk in, you are welcomed with beautiful colour saris and decoration on the wall.  But as you go in to sit down, you are greeted with plastic lawn chairs and tables.  I guess the slight premium paid doesn't go towards the decor.  STAFF The staff were absolutely wonderful. They greeted us at the door, sent our order in quickly, provided us with water.  The key thing was that when  he asked us how are food was, we casually told him there were a lot of bones in the Karahi Chicken.  The waiter didn't take any offense to the comment and said he would make it up to us by giving us a bit more chicken.  A bit more turned into another order of Karahi.  He made our experience a lot better.  Although the wait staff were great, I am not sure whether I would come back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Love this place sizzlin kebab and the onions and chillies make it legit from the years I spent in India/Pakistan. I really wish they didn't use so much disposable cutlery and plates it's been open for a long time now and when they had portables and it looked like a pop-up it was excuseable and cheap but now they should really consider the environment and get with reuseable dishes."}
{"text":"Lahore Tikka house is a very popular Pakistani/Indian food restaurant, but not the best place in my opinion. The food is not bad, its quiet good but I don't understand what people rave about. The place is always busy whether it is a weeknight or weekend. Parking lot is very difficult to get in and out of, so park somewhere else.   I usually get the pani puri to start, then kebobs, butter chicken, and naan. The pani puris are good, but then again its very hard to make them bad. The chicken and the lamb kebobs are good and the butter chicken is ok.    I would not get the Biryani here, cause its not authentic Biryani! Good Biryani rice has a nice scent to it and their Biryani does not. Also similar to what the other yelpers are saying, the food is very greasy. The kebobs are greasy, the butter chicken is greasy, the vegetable trio dish had a pool of oil. May be thats the secret to their food tasting good.   I would recommend to try the Kashmiri Chai! It is my favourite.   Tip: The food smell will linger on your clothes until you wash them."}
{"text":"This place has got the best kababs, the overall food even though a bit oily, tastes amazing. The service is fantastic, the food shows up as soon as you order even though its always busy. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This place is freakin' awesome. Best practical regular Indian food in the city I think (barring some really fancy places). Sure, it's a hole in the wall (well, actually several trailers in the wall) but who effing cares. Deal with the styrofoam plates. The plastic cutlery. You're coming for the food, not the atmosphere at this place. One thing that actually is on the nice side are the restrooms. They share them with the place next door. They are very clean and have those sensor taps and soap dispensers. Great if you get ethnic fatigue too early :) But I digress..  On to the food. The butter chicken is the best I have ever had (and I've had really good homemade stuff at an Indian friend's house many times). Had a really nice kick to it. And the chicken was cooked in the tandoor before it was bathed in the butter chicken sauce. So its like tandoori chicken in butter chicken sauce. The grilled lamb skewers were also fantastic. Bursting with flavour. I would steer clear of the samosas. They are not bad, just not worth wasting space on!   I will admit that depending on what you order, the food can be a bit on the greasy side, but it is so damn good. I think next time I will focus exclusively on the BBQ stuff."}
{"text":"This has been a favourite place of mine for years. But lately the service has been.. quite maddeningly ridiculous. The restaurant now has a (perfectly sensible) policy of not seating a party until everyone has arrived. But today is learnt the hard way that they will follow this policy to the letter even when the place is nowhere close to busy. I was with a party of 5 on a lazy Monday evening, came ahead of time before my family, and they refused to seat me even though I see at least 9 empty tables that can seat 6 each. Upon protesting politely, I was told that I cannot be seated in case a larger party party appeared. At this point, the evening crowd got even less populous. It was.. a poor execution of a good policy. I wish they trained their host staff to be flexible depending on how busy the evening is."}
{"text":"Just wanted to note that I have never been into the restaurant, but my boss and his wife had them cater their wedding reception. The food was fantastic. Can't wait to get down to the restaurant for more.   (Note to other posters: the 'spice cream' is probably kulfi, which is a sort of condensed milk ice cream. Yummmm. As for the lack of beer, I wouldn't expect a halal restaurant to have alcohol! Try the lassi, it'll put out the fire better than beer anyways.)"}
{"text":"Just came back to Lahore Tikka House last weekend and the food is still amazing!  They still have the plastic utensils and all, but a lot has changed too.  There's a lot more people working, waiting the line, etc.  The ordering is a bit different, they make you write down your order on a little whiteboard.  The service was impeccable and the wait for a seat was completely worth it.    What's also new is a buffet that they have upstairs.  There's no wait for the buffet, but I feel like it's a bit of a newbie trap.  Don't do the buffet, the selection is small and it doesn't look nearly as good.  Stick it out and wait in line.  Always order the naan, and there's no reason to order more than one rice dish unless you have a party greater than four.  And if you have room, always always order the popsicle called kulfi.  I can't believe the place is still under construction after all these years!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & incredible service. They were so accommodating and provided dates and food right at iftar for customers that were fasting. Every dish was mouthwatering. We ordered the papdi chaat, butter chicken, seekh kabob, chicken tikka and garlic naan. You will love the food, atmosphere & service."}
{"text":"I've been to Lahore twice and enjoyed it both times.  The funny thing is that both times we went we ordered the same thing. The meat is delicious and that really is the reason to come here. The one thing I will say is that the veggie combo is not that good. We've ordered it twice and the second time, when it arrived we immediately remembered that we had vowed not to get it again. Mostly everything comes thrown together and just isn't that tasty. The setup is kind of strange, you order at the counter and then they deliver to you. Lots of seating is outside in what is basically a tent. I've only been in the summer but it was nice to be outside.  I would definitely take people here again, but especially for the carnivores."}
{"text":"Oh to bend time and space to bring this place closer to my home in Etobicoke.  This has been one of my absolute favorite places since I discovered it in 2010.  It has evolved from a trailer to a pretty big building and massive patio.  Still set up to eat family style and they have done away with the disposable dishes.  The food is still amazing, and I continue to bring my peeps here every time they are in from out of town.  I used to think that love was too strong of a term for this place....but as I have moved further away and time has passed, my longing and desire for this place has solidified what can only be termed as love for this place."}
{"text":"Wish I could rate this restaurant lower than one star. Came all the way from the States hearing all the hype about Lahore Tikka House. I've never been so disappointed. Ordered Nihari, Beef Kabob, lamb Biryani, and can't say one good thing. You could tell the food was old. I would NOT recommend coming here, especially with high expectations. Try other restaurants on Gerrard, I'm sure they'll be better."}
{"text":"Just my fave place.  The butter chicken is more oily ghee that just permeates the chicken.  Flavour! If you like the butter chicken that looks like smooth, orange Chef Boyardee, go elsewhere.   Everything else I've had here is great too - except the ambiance.  But who cares?"}
{"text":"Decided to come to little India for lunch with a friend, most the restaurants in the area didn't really look like dressy restaurants and looked more like quick take out so we decided to stop here. The restaurant is decorated nicely and looks clean.  I ordered the butter chicken, 2 naan breads and 2 chicken skewers. It was definitely a lot of food and filled me up. The food was made fresh and was served to us quickly.   It wasn't the best butter chicken I've had at all, there are a lot of better places I'd recommend instead of here. None of the food stood out much to me from what I've tried.  The service was great, so it disappoints me to have to give them a less then great review. I probably won't be back here soon."}
{"text":"Its disgust on name of Lahori food.. Worst lahori food ever.. Nothing was good except gol gappa's.."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here and I have to say I was pretty pleased. Food was ready on time and only took 10-15 minutes. Portions were plentiful and weren't just sauce with a few chunks of whatever dish you ordered.  We got naans, beef kababs, mutter paneer and the veggie combo sizzler. I never had a mutter paneer loaded with so many peas. It was fantastic. The kababs were good and I would totally order them again too. Though I might try a different protein next time. The combo sizzler was good and also good value. Its a bigger dish than the mutter paneer. All the portions were great and tasted great too.  Who knew Pakastan made such good Indian food? So pleased to have a go to Indian/Pakastan restaurant in the area. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Service was great food was delivered to the table very quickly but overall I felt it lacked flavor. The butter chicken was tart/limey not creamy and semi-sweet. The tandoori chicken leg was decent for $6 but didn't make me go \"yummmm so good\" it was just basic, the butter naan was ok, good portion, the samosas where great and the popsicle ice cream bar was good."}
{"text":"Delicious lamb curry and chicken biryani! The curry is flavourful with tender chunks of lamb.  The chicken biryani was moist and bursting with authenticity. Both dishes were generously portioned.   Service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"So we chose this restaurant to celebrate our aunts birthday. We were warmly welcomed upon arrival. The person working at the front desk was very friendly. Unfortunately they don't allow strollers in the dining area so the individual told us he would put the stroller behind him and watch it for us as we felt uncomfortable leaving it on the side in the open.  We ordered a variety of dishes from butter chicken, biryani, chicken and beef kabobs, tandoori chicken pieces, naan and chicken tikka masala. The biryani was oily and we ended up finding a hair inside the kabob. The staff was very apologetic and took it back and ended up giving us a credit. Overall food was ok until the hair was found. The customer service provided was great. Staff was approachable and very kind. The food needs improvement and they need to be careful by wearing hair nets while preparing their food."}
{"text":"- Probably the most popular Indian restaurant in town. Excessive hype IMO - As authentic as you will get in Toronto. The ambience, decor,  the people, the area itself all contribute to the experience. - Everything served in styrofoam plates and cups. Not my favorite part about the place. - Staff are friendly. Usually extremely busy. Late night isn't a bad option.  - Recommended items : Chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, tadka daal and definitely try the mango lassi."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating at Lahore Tikka House. This place is a bit quirky and the decor is a little thrown together, but it adds to the ambiance. Both times I came here was during the winter so I didn't get to experience the patio, but there is a tukutk/motorbike out there that makes me like this place even more.   The ordering system is a bit quirky. You sit down, someone comes around to help you navigate through the menu, then you write your order on a white board and you walk up to the cashier and have them punch in the order and give you a number. However, this process only applies to food. You have to order drinks with the wait staff.   Coming here with a group is the best way to try everything. The food here is really good.Tried various things here and they were all good. Butter chicken, BBQ beef ribs on a sizzling plate, paneer, chaat papri, lamb and beef kabab, haleem curry. My favorite is the beef ribs - very tender and juicy.   One draw back is, your clothes and pores smell like the restaurant for days... leave your jacket in the car if you can."}
{"text":"I kept giving this place chance after chance, simply due to the sheer power of the name that Lahore Tikka House has, which as we all know is synonymous with Pakistani cuisine in this city.   But after having had the full LTH experience 4 times in the recent past now, I'm just gonna go ahead and say it: I think Lahore Tikka House must have been amazing once upon a time to have earned this reputation, but at this point in time, it definitely does not live up the hype. I have no choice but to conclude that the restaurant's reputation is probably being upheld solely by the white people in the Beaches who don't know good Pakistani food.   Not commenting on any other aspect of this restaurant - just the food - and the facts are: the food is just NOT good.   Please, LTH chefs, take lessons from any of the other Pakistani restaurants in Toronto: Shaheen, Pak Centre, Patna Kebab House, Karahi Point, literally any of them, because at this point, your food is simply at the bottom of the lot."}
{"text":"Food was okay. It was very heavy and did not taste that fresh. The sitting and ordering process was very confusing. I found a hair in my kulfi :("}
{"text":"Ewwww!!! Horrible food! Indians - do not go there. Tried Seekh Kebab and Afghani Chicken. Its supposed to be grilled. But the meat is dry and they deep fry or drizzle it with loads of oil to make it taste soft. Totally kills the taste, bad for the heart and doesn't even taste fresh. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"Good: - food is authentic and spicy. Depending on what you order it can be a bit oily.  Bad: - Way over priced for what you get. The mains are decent size , but the side dishes are minuscule. You'll need to order lots of sides, which soon adds up ( expect to pay $50 a person with no alcohol). - zero atmosphere. We were seated in a basement room on plastic chairs and folding tables. Plastic utensils and styrofoam cups too. - service is friendly, but food coming out of the kitchen is slow - no one seems to be in charge. When we first got there we had to line up and no one seemed to be doing anything or taking care of customers.  Bottom line:  There are better places in Little India that serve better food for more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, great tandoori and curry.  The staff is also really friendly and attentive.  The parking is limited though for such a big restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried and true.  Consistent and always good.  Freshness of the food is undeniable.  Seasonings measured with care.  Portions enormous.  Try the kebabs (lamb and chicken respectively), vegetable biryani and a naan or two and you are in business.  Their raita is delicately seasoned with roasted cumin.  Ahhh ... next time I am going to have the beef haleem which looked and smelled divine.  The thing I particularly love about this place is the lack of overuse of oil which can be problematic in an Indian or Pakistani restaurant.  Place is 100% Halal.  Nice in the evenings when the lights are on in the \"tent\", they even have an old tuk-tuk outside!  Several patrons from the US (Texas, New Jersey) frequenting this restaurant during the Labour Day weekend.  Have had their karhai gosht before which was melt in your mouth delicious.  One of my favourite, if not my favourite Pakistani restaurant in Toronto.  I would give it a five if they only got rid of those horrible styrofoam cups, plates and plastic knives, forks and spoons.  An unfortunate way to be enjoying such top-quality cuisine on such ghastly \"flatware\"."}
{"text":"Dollar for dollar, LTH is one of the best restaurants in the city (and yes it deserves it's own acronym!).   Prepare yourself to embark on a journey, half way around the world only to enter a setting that forces its third world ambience upon you and yet settles it with the aroma of world class Pakistani cuisine.   If your gonna put up a fuss about disposable cutlery, plastic chairs or the 'rennovations' that don't ever seem be complete, then LTH is clearly not for you.  Otherwise if good food and a uniquely fun experience is what you're craving, this place stands with it's head up high among the best restaurants this city has to offer.   Personal favorates include the lamb kebobs, beef kebobs, butter chicken and daal makhani. Like many other great restaurants, very few things off the menu are bad but the kebobs (preferably the red meat ones) are DEE-F'N-LICIOUS!   The prices are too good for this food, but i guess that explains the use of plastic forks and styrafoam plates.   Unless you're planning a trip half way across the world, this is the best way to experience Pakistan for it's delicious cuisine and in your face culture."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a delicious bite that will be both time and cost efficient you cant go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Well as a native of Lahore and now living in Toronto. I can say that this place is pretty close to being authentic. The service is very quick, YES, very quick. The quality of the food is great, its fresh, hot and sometimes sizzling. I would recommend sitting outside than inside especially during summers. The biryani is unbeatable, I can make some kick-ass biryani myself bu their lamb biryani is truly out of this world. If you are a little adventurous try the 'brain masala' - yes it is cow brain but its pretty awesome. I didn't tell my friends until after they had eaten and they had throughly enjoyed it. Don't forget to order mango lassi to push it all down.  Trust me you will not be disappointed and if you are a vegetarian all the items including aloo gobhi and daal fry are great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are next to Little India. I'd tried this place almost a decade ago and it was okay. We went back a few months ago with family. It was just so so good. We got the hariyali chicken which was green as well as kebabs for appetizers. The chicken was spiced perfectly and the kebabs were tender and succulent. For a main, we ordered lamb and chicken biriyani, butter chicken, and another lamb curry along with some naans. Nothing disappointed in terms of food.   Service on the other hand could do with some serious improvement. Our server was a young woman, very friendly, but it looked like the place was understaffed and she was pulled between many tables. She'd forget water, utensils, plates.   We do plan to return for dinner on Tuesday so I hope the service is as good as the food then. I will be updating to let you know!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but lately I have been very disappointed! The last few times I got take-out and it was terrible! I ordered a butter chicken and a chicken tikka. Not only did they not label which one was which, they tasted exactly the same. (Chicken tikka is supposed to be spicier.)  Also, in both dishes, there are only 3-4 tiny little chunks of chicken swimming in a pool of such! Is say probably a quarter of a chicken breast! For $15 bucks each I'd expect way more. There are so many other choices in that area, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is probably the most authentic Indian/Pakistani food I've ever eaten. You don't get silver spoons to eat with but silver spoons are over rated. Everything tasted exactly as it should be if not better and the service was better than a 1 star Michelin. Our waters were refilled as fast as we finished them, the owner came personally to check if everything was good and our order came  so quickly even though the place was crowded. I didn't think places like this existed, would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in getting some quality food!"}
{"text":"Going down , I have been going there for many years but service and food is going down . Serving old or over cooked Chicken ...... The nan is not what it used to be , it is half cooked."}
{"text":"Absolute best Pakistani food in Toronto. They've expanded a lot recently, and their new outdoor patio is great during summer. The ambiance is also pretty authentic, especially in warm weather when people are hanging out outside a lot on Gerrard Street.   Fantastic lamb kebabs."}
{"text":"Holy cow! No pun intended, this place was absolutely amazing. I've tried quite a few Indian and Pakistani restaurants around the GTA and this place absolutely blows all of them out of the water. The vibe is pretty authentic and no frills, including plastic utensils and paper plates. But the food is so good I would be ok with eating it off the floor. We tried all the staples you'd expect at an Indian restaurant and everything was flavourful, fresh and fantastic. The chicken was moist and flavourful, the kebabs were well seasoned, the naan was fresh and fluffy., the chana and dhal both had wonderful depth of flavour.  I can't wait until my next visit."}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated.   I am a vegetarian and have been there few times. Food is good (not excellent) and service is good. I think it's little pricy too. Overall, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for last 11 yrs, and it is still the best Pakistani restaurant in town.  Order these items and you'll never be disappointed:  Haleem (crushed lentil and beef stew) Nihari (cow bone marrow stew) Lamb biryani Garlic naan Falooda ( drink with chia seeds noodles and icecream) Pistachio Kulfi ( pistachio gelato on a stick)  Service here is friendly and food here is tasty and greasy!!"}
{"text":"Extremely busy restaurant and not easy to get a table for one ad I was in town for a business meeting. Food is great and the desert was awesome. Will visit again when I am back in town again."}
{"text":"The most authentic Indian food I've had in a while. The biryani was amazing, and the kebabs were mouth watering. The service was extremely fast and the staff is very friendly. I've come here twice in one week! I recommend to everyone I can, although it's somewhat pricey, but you're paying for great quality."}
{"text":"OK I have updated my review on here. Dropping down from a 5 to a 2. This place used to be one of my favorites whenever I visited or even thought of Toronto. Sadly, with my recent visit there I was very, very, very disappointed to the point where I don't think I'd be returning back. Their quality of both service and food has completely gone down the drain!! Upon arriving we were seated by the staff and told to use the erasable board on the table to write down our order and then take it to the counter. Really??? So then what is the point of having several staff just standing around and chatting with each other? It made absolutely no sense to me. Anyhow we wen't on to order our usual Kabobs, Lamb Chops, Butter Chicken, Naan and Biryani. First off I think that it took at least 30mins for us to receive our food while I noticed that 2 other tables that came after us had already received their food and began eating. Very disappointed already. Then comes our food...the Kabobs were ok, the Lamb Chops came with perhaps 5 pieces and most with almost no meat on the bones and filled with fillers like potatoes and onions...so what was I paying so much money for??? I refused to pay for this poor quality and complained to the waiter who took the item back and ended up brining back the exact same thing to us! No apologies or anything...can the service get any worse? SADLY YES! The butter chicken came with 4 small pieces of cubed meat....WHAT??? Yup you heard right  and I have pictures to prove it. Overall I would not come back to this place again. Hope management reads this and takes some serious measures to make improvement to the restaurant before they begin losing more and more customers."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I see all these amazing reviews here and I think \"wow this place must be amazing\". So having gone there recently I am still confused why people love this place and why I didn't. I am pretty sure it all boils down to meat eater vs. non-meat eater. I am of the latter persuasion and I ordered the veggie sizzler combo with consisted of four veggie dishes (sweet) including  chana, cauliflower, lentil and spinach. I also ordered two naan as I LOVE naan. My friend ordered lamb kebabs and butter chicken and one naan order. Our food was prefaced with an unusual salad that came with raitha and samosa dipping sauce. Herein the confusion starts. Why on earth would anyone eat samosa dipping sauce with their chopped salad? Are these restaurant owners trying to pull a fast one and trick unassuming patrons into thinking they created an original, one of a kind salad dressing? This must have been so since the samosas sitting in the glass serving hut were \"only for weekends\".    Our food arrive very quickly and mine looked at first to be a mound of piping hot food. All four dishes were piled onto one big serving dish and my eyes could not stop going back and forth trying to understand what I was seeing. Much like when I looked around at the various hodge podge of bright Indian fabrics tacked to various surfaces. And while the initial charm of being in a restaurant that really felt like India, the experience was far from the great food and service you would ever get there. I attempted to eat my dish and in each spoonful was quite unaware of what I was actually tasting. Not only were all my four dishes inconsiderately mounded together the oceans of oil they came in made the flavour distinction impossible to detect. I sat there and removed tablespoon upon tablespoon of oil. My friend's butter chicken had pools of separated oil. Yuck.    I also wasn't amused with the tiny portion of raitha (yoghurt) they offered. I was raised on homemade yoghurt of which I ate copious amounts at each meal. I don't know what other Indians do, but asking for 3 servings of their environmentally unfriendly styrofoam packaged raitha was annoying.   To add insult to injury, I don't know if the cooks were having a bad day but my naan were not light and fluffy. Grrr.   And what is with the self-serve ordering? You place your order at the till like its a fast food restaurant. I don't get it.   I will say my friend seemed happy with her meat though a bit high on her spice meter. Her butter chicken was made with tandoor naan and her kebabs with minced, spiced meat.   The only thing I really like about being there was the enjoyable ambiance and rhythmic chanting of Nasrat Fateh Ali Khan which I will now listen to in order to unwind from this super horrible dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is so crazy and the ambiance is over the top.. it makes me giggle everytime I go there.  This time the restaurant part was in a plastic tent on ashphalt and all the tables are crooked.  The plates and glasses are disposable.    The food is hot and fresh and the flavour good.  The prices have gone up a bit since I was last there but it's still really reasonable.  As crazy as the decor I love going there.. as the food is always really good."}
{"text":"The food never disappoints. Prices are good for the value and quality. It is a gem and the Kelfi is a must."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here!  India is on my bucket list of countries to visit and this is how I envision dinning in India.  It's loud, it's casual but totally chaotic fun atmosphere.   Our party of four were seated near the kitchen which gave us the best view into the kitchen but also a choking Hazard when a fresh plate of sizzling meat comes out from the kitchen.  The spices used in the dishes were overwhelming and fog up half of the resto. Our party ordered an array of kebobs, butter chicken, beef ribs, veg briyani and the Spinach with naan.  Every dish was intensely flavourful, in fact a bit too intense for me. Don't get me wrong, it was still good but just too powerful and spicy for my liking.   The portions here are very generous, way more than you typical Indian restos. The servers were super friendly, came by to update us on our order but the fact that our order took more than 20 mins to come out made me real hangry.  Overall, I think I give it another shot but I will choose dishes with milder flavours."}
{"text":"The butter chicken alone is worth it as it's made properly. Yogurt based. Not  sweet. Spicy."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch. I was surprised by how high the prices were. We made the mistake of coming here rather than an AYCE buffet restaurant (it was buffet quality food). I eat a lot of Indian food, and the only memorable items they served were the mango shakes (they don't call it a lassi) and the naan was okay when eaten hot. Otherwise the butter chicken was not sweet, but instead it was more on the tangy side. Yes, I know that real Indian butter chicken is not supposed to be sweet. The fish curry still had bones in it. Really!? You can choke on that! Each meat dish was over $10 and it did not come with rice or naan. The rice and naan had to be purchased separately!! So really, you were paying about $15 per dish (lunch!), plus $3.50 for the mango shake. Oh, and I got a $1 vegetable samosa that I could not finish."}
{"text":"I went there after more than 5 years. The place is finally out of  construction mode (I think...), and the decor is uhm...cute in a whoa, kind of a wedding tent in Bangladesh,  but I have to hand it to them - their food is still pretty good! Normally I get their butter chicken, but today we went with their Karahi Beef and chicken kabobs, plus a couple of naans for a quick lunch. The guy at the order desk was super busy and distracted but very very sweet. The food came relatively quickly, so they really were catering to the lunch crowd, and I think for the price, the taste and the location, it's definitely worth 3.5- 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went to Lahore for some good food only to be disappointed.  Chana Masala and aloo gobi were inundated with oil and the chicken biryani was soggy and bland. I disliked the cheap Styrofoam the pricy-ish dinner was served on. Extremely bad for the environment and it felt like a dinner Dollerama. The flies, approx half a dozen, would never leave me alone as attempted to dine.  The food probably would have been right up their ally and serve their taste pallet better than mine. I expressed my disappointment to receive $5.00 off my meal and many attempts I turned down for free drinks and ice cream. You can't buy reviews with pocket change.   LAHORE had a georgeous bathroom that got them the 1 star above.   There was a big table dine and dash while I was there. We should have done the same thing."}
{"text":"It's one of the places I had been before. Almost 2-3 years back and this time too, amazing taste. Best for non veg items (lamb, chicken and fish). My fav lamb chops and chicken kadhai. Asked for spicy and what a memorable taste. Would definitely come back here and recommend"}
{"text":"The best restaurant for indian food.  The food is really fresh and taste great.  Do not come here when it's close to closing time as you would be rushed out.  They can upgrade their dishes, forks and spoons."}
{"text":"Good food but overpriced for small servings.  They discontinued my favourite dish; chicken tikka masala. They say its basically butter chicken with a few slight changes.  When I get it, its not the same.     *chanting* we want chicken tikka masala! We want chicken tikka masala!!  They also changed how they make their garlic naan. It used to be the best in the city, now it's just a stiff flat disc like everywhere else.  We had the Kashmiri tea, and it just tasted like sweetened milk. They have to step up their spice game on the tea.  They also make you write your order on a dollar store whiteboard and walk it over to the cash register to put in your order. So ghetto.  Hey at least they're not serving food in styrofoam plates anymore *smh."}
{"text":"Lahore was the very first place I tried on Gerrard back in the day.  For this reason, it still holds a certain nostalgia for me.  The portables, the plastic utensils and plates, the sporadic Bollywood tunes, and the colourful materials tacked to the walls and ceiling all bring me back to the first mouthful of the combo sizzler - I was hooked.    Unfortunately, the love affair is almost over.  I have noted the quality and quantity of the dishes has really suffered.  For example, if you get the chicken tikka masala you get a few scared pieces of chicken drowning in a sea of very oily sauce.  Okay, maybe that's to be expected from that specific dish, but I find the same problem with other dishes such as the palak paneer.  Some dishes are still good though... the chicken kabab is tasty though seriously salty and the naan is always satisfying.  I'm not going to pan the place because the service is really good and the world's slowest reno is, in its own right, awesome.  It is my most sincere wish that Lahore steps up its game and reclaims it's former glory days of serving this gori some quality eats."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and LOVE IT! Stick to the meat dishes as they are the speciality. The veggies are just ok and a little oily. But the kabobs, naans and biriyani's are to DIE for!"}
{"text":"FOOD:   PRO: Their Pani Puri, Kulfi, and Bharta are the best!  CON: Don't bother about the other dishes like Butter Chicken and Palak Paneer. Their Butter Chicken and Palak Paneer has a weird taste and texture during my second time there. First time I went there, their Butter Chicken and Palak Paneer were good though. I'd say they could get inconsistent sometimes. (Probably wasn't my lucky day, haha!)  PRICE:   CON: A lil bit on the expensive side.   AMBIANCE:   PRO: Authentic and Indian vibe here. CON: A bit loud and too packed during peak hours. Expect a long line during dinner time.  SERVICE:  PRO: They are very friendly and accommodating here. When I accidentally touched my hot plate, I asked the cashier lady if she has a band aid. She was very mother like that she took the band aid and even put it in my already red finger, and even gave me an extra band aid for it."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great service. Visited this place with my friends and I just loved it. Specially Afghani chicken and kadhai chicken were delicious. Garlic and butter naan are super soft and their portion size of food they offer is pretty decent too. I will visit this place again when I visit Toronto. I wish we had some place like this in Buffalo too :(  ."}
{"text":"Walked over an hour to get because a guy in my hostel told me this was the best Indian / Pakistani food in Toronto. I ordered  two of the lamb chicken and beef kabobs , a side of garlic naan and a samosa . The food was spiced and cooked to perfection .  My only qualms with this place are that the Kebabs are on the smaller side and you  can't adjust the heat level since the meat is premarinated. You can add a side of chiilis but it's not the same .    . Whenever you go to an Indian spot and get tandoori items you usually get a green sauce as well as a sweet purple / red sauce .which I got with my kebabs here .  With the exception of the raita this place offered the best duping sauces I've ever.   I highly recommend you check this place out if you're planning to visit Toronto and have a hankering for Indian .  I'll definitely be back ."}
{"text":"First restaurant tried in toronto and its simply surprising for me.ambience and atmosphere is amazing"}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype building towards a group dinner here, but LTH delivered! We came in a group of 8 on a Friday night and it was easy to get a seat before 7pm. A friend ordered for the whole party to eat family style and we shared:  - Beef, Chicken, Lamb Kababs - Hara Chicken - Chicken Biryani - Lamb Kharai - Paneer Tikka Masala - Naan - Pistachio Kulfi  It was cool to see some items not typically served at other South Asian joints downtown. Some dishes were a bit less spicy than conventional but they were still all rich, flavourful and filling. Service was polite and efficient - while some may complain about writing your own order or eating off of low end tableware, it's really not a place to expect exceptional service when the food is already such good value. Factoring that we totally over-ate and left feeling extremely full, we still paid less than $25 each after tax and tip!"}
{"text":"meh, OK.  So, Lahore Tikka House USED to be good but im just not that big of a fan of it anymore. Surprisingly out of all of the dishes I ordered I liked the most simple one which was the chana, chickpeas. The flavours were there and you couldnt help but take more.  The chicken kababs, beef kababs, biryani and butter chicken were just MEH. I didn't care to eat much of it and just ended up packing it to go. OH and their kashmiri chai sucks, i'd rather go a few doors down and get the other kashmiri chai thats served along the street. They dont put pistachio in it and instead put almond that are grated completely.  The ambiance of Lahore Tikka House makes you feel like youre back home which is a nice feel. But overall theres just so many better places to eat if you want pakistani food."}
{"text":"How terrible! I saw a lot of the negative reviews but overlooked them for the positive ones-- bad move. Compared to other restaurants nearby this one definitely seems the best from the outside. But as soon as you step in things go downward. No waiters to sit you down or ask you for items. You look at the menu, YOU write it down, and YOU walk you request up to the unfriendly old woman at the counter. From there you sit down and I ordered channa, tarka daal, and chicken tikka. The channa was OK, the 'tarka' daal consisted of the cheapest lentils and had absolutely no tadka whatsoever. The chicken tikka was cold and dry--none of the food is ever made to order; instead it just sits around in the kitchen and they bring it out once it's ordered. Samosas were heavily refried. They don't even give you basics like chutney, raita, or onions unless you get up and specifically ask. Portions were small too and service was subpar. Wouldn't recommend at all."}
{"text":"Fast and furious!! cheap and pretty good; going there is like going to eat in the family kitchen of a very nice Indian family (staff is soooo friendly and smiling!!). I would like the upscale version of it now."}
{"text":"Damn spicy. Damn greasy. Damn cheap. Damn tasty."}
{"text":"Meh food and convoluted dinner experience!  My husband and I dined here few years ago and wasn't a fan, but we gave it a second try recently because people kept telling us that it's good. We always see it packed, so we said why not.  As we entered the main area, we won't sure whether we wait in the line where people are ordering take out, or a host or hostess will sit as down. After a minute of waiting, we decided to wait in line and someone at the cash was asking us how many people, we said two. Nothing happened. Moments later, a person at food counter asked us the same question, and we said two people. Nothing happened. Third time, a person asked us the same question and this time she told us to find a table and she'll bring us the menu.   As we sat down, the lady gave us menus and a personalized white board and marker. We were at a loss of what we're suppose to do, until I read the 4 steps instructions on the back side of the menu. We had to write each dish name in full on the white board, because the menu doesn't have numbers. They don't have menu sheets with check boxes like most typical places. Aside from that once we filled the white board, we had to walk to the cash to order, then in exchange they give you a table number. Also, you can't order drinks at the cash, but you have to flag down a waiter to order drinks. Once the food came, you take your table number, and return back to the cash to pay.   When my husband paid for the meal, the cashier asked whether he wanted to tip. My husband said yes and the cashier asked how much. The cashier gave my husband the cash, so he can return back to the table to tip.  If the food was good, we would put up with services like this. But because the Lamb Biryani, Butter Chicken, Tikka Masala Paneer, and the Naan was something we've had better even at an Indian buffet. Then it's really not worth the pain.  Needless to say, we will NOT return!"}
{"text":"Such delicious Indian food! The service was fast, the portions were incredibly generous, and did I mention how delicious the food was? Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, rich \"street style\" Pakistani food.  Lots of heavy sauces, with smoky flavors.  This place is unlike any Indian restaurant.  Don't expect much in the way of decor as you might be seated in a portable or a tent, or outside.  The atmosphere is almost communal.  I've never been to Pakistan, but I think this might be a space-time wormhole to Lahore.  While you're at the neighborhood, you should check out the Sari stores in little India.  The textures and colors are a feast for the eyes.  Or, hop into a DVD/variety store and expand on your Bollywood collection."}
{"text":"Fathers Day Dinner!   Great place with good atmosphere!   We ordered Chicken Tikka Biryani, Hara Chicken, naan bread and Butter Chicken!   Really good and I'm not sure how authentic but it tastes really good!!  Must try if you like Indian food and in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Indo-Pak food. Very casual Dhaba style atmosphere but loved it. Great food..."}
{"text":"This place is all about the taste of the food. From gol gappay to kulfi, the food is authentic and tasty. The prices are average except for the gol gappay that, at $1 each ($8 for 8) are ridiculously overpriced. The ambience is that of a small town street-side eatery. Service is better when it's busier as there's more servers. Be aware that the Green P lot is reserved for TDSB before 6:00 PM - at least on weekdays."}
{"text":"I am always amazed by why people like this place. Take it from someone who understands Indian/Pakistani food - this is terrible! It's shameful these people get the kind of business they do. I've been 3 times to give them a chance, and each time it's been awful. They obviously make a lot of money given the crowd and the prices of their dishes, but it's just going into their pocket. Substandard quality and styrofoam/plastic and lining up to order is not why we pay these prices.  Horribly oily and greasy food, non-authentic and quick-alternative flavours is what they churn out. The kebabs seem fried rather than from a tandoor. I could go on and on.  This is the best. We asked for a spoon to take out some whole chillies from our dish. The waiter puts his hands into our dish and takes out the chillies. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  One extra star is for the authentic street style decor. Avoid this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is still really great.  I always enjoy my experience here .  We ordered butter chicken (regular spice) and lamb curry (spicy) with two sides of garlic naan.  Raita, BBQ chillis and hot sauce needs to be ordered from the servers.  The lamb curry was delicious! One of my fave on the menu for sure!  The butter chicken--was good but nothing too spectacular, the server even said it was made in the manner for Westerners (mind you I'm not Indian or a Western).  Still loving this place!"}
{"text":"Recently - about 3 weeks about I visited Lahore Tikka with family and this update is strictly towards my experience this particular visit. The 3 stars in mainly for the service we received that day.   We were all very surprised the decrease in service and friendliness of the servers we received that day. I really hope this is not what brings down Lahore Tikaa's reputation. Because the food is amazing, we ordered our usuals, and the sitting area was more open and larger. Obviously they are making changes since it is so busy, all the time.  Please please Lahore Tikka, conduct a quality control on the service by your waiters!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have tried.  The butter chicken is \"butta\".  The beef ribs come right off the grille sizzling hot.  The staff is welcoming and friendly.  For 2 it's going to set you back approx $50 so not too bad."}
{"text":"This is my first negative review. Ever. I ordered 1 vegetable biryani and 1 lamb biryani, the lamb had 5 bones and ONE small piece of lamb, though delicious, I was VERY unsatisfied. No veggies, plain rice  and lack of any substance  what a load of boring crap. I guess they treat take out orders this way? I live nearby and I will never allow anyone I know to visit this place. Sincerely angry and cheated. (The vegetable biryani is fine.)"}
{"text":"There were two things that stopped this from being a 4 star review.  1.  No alcohol.  A beer would have been great to have with dinner. 2.  The plates, cups, and utensils were all Styrofoam and plastic.  Am I camping?  No I'm at a restaurant..   The food was fantastic.  We literally had our first dish landing on our table in under 5 minutes after ordering.  The Butter Chicken was probably the best dish, though it was a little skimpy on the chicken.  The rice dishes and kabobs were very well spiced also.  The naan is all made fresh on site and was super yummy, especially the garlic naan.  The servers were friendly and very helpful with deciphering the menu for us.  The only weird thing with the service was that we had to check off what we wanted on a paper menu and then order at the front desk.  But after that we could order individual dishes and more naan from the server.  For dessert we all tried what we dubbed \"spice cream\".  These were essentially Popsicles with odd flavorings.  I tried the almond flavor which seemed to be the most popular among all of the patrons.  Other flavors included mango and pistachio.    For under $20 each for each Yelper it was well worth the money.  I left stuffed but not feeling gross."}
{"text":"Very authentic Pakistani food. Excellent kebabs. the Karahi curries were tasty and well spiced but not exceptionally hot. Naans and Kulfi were tasty as well.  Gerrerd street's BEST restaurant."}
{"text":"I really feel the LOVE when I was eating at Lahore Tikka House!!   I was fully prepared for a crappy under construction/renovation place before my arrival from reading the reviewers and from my fellow dining mates. But I find that the imperfection of the deco gave it a certain charm.   We were seated in the \"Patio\", just love this open and communal style seating! It gave me a feel of attending a wedding with all the music and noises, a feel of eating in an Asian countryside somewhere (yes it did get hot with the crowd and all the spicy and smoke from the food).   Garlic Naan ($1.95)  - was so good... yes a full carb attack.. fresh and soft and oily!!   Butter Chicken ($10.95)  - deliciously oily, the sauce taste so good with the Naan bread.. the chicken itself is so so  Aloo Gobi ($7.25) and Chana Masala ($7.25)  - hot and spicy and oily cauliflower and potato/chick pea! Guilty delicious and even my non veggie eating friend could not stop complimenting how good his veggie is!!   Lahori Beef Kabab ($1.99 each)  - soft and nicely spiced...and the sizzling hot plate makes the oil splashing everywhere.... hmmmm   Kashmiri Chai ($2.49)  - Pakistani tea tasted so good.. especially I am a fan of nuts... I drank that like a dessert! My first experience with pink tea.. now I am in love!   Lahori Kuifi ($2.50)  - creamy, custardy ice popsicle that never melt?? It is so devilish creamy ... just don't think about the fat content and enjoy!!   The services here is awesome for a hole in the wall, under construction restaurant!! I have more attention than in one of those high priced snobby restaurants.   PS the waiter was walking around with a long skewers of green chili peppers!! Just wave him down and he gave me all the chili I want!! :)   I can't wait to come back here again with my dear friends!!  Talking about smell and smoke eating here! My phone smells like Butter Chicken....I can smell it even I tried wipping it down...."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst butter chicken and naan I have ever eaten, solidifying their nickname of 'hore-house'. I wish I could give them negative stars. (Can you believe they're about to be featured on 'you gotta eat here'??)   We ordered butter chicken and 2 pieces of naan for take out. $18 is pricey, considering you can get much more for less at literally ANYWHERE ELSE on Gerrard, not even accounting for taste. I had heard bad things and previously avoided this place, but I gave them a chance because the restaurant I was heading to had gone out of business.   It was near close although the place was still packed and they sat a table of 12 or so after we ordered, so my bad experience shouldn't be an end of the night problem. This place is a miss-match of colour and ugly upside down carpets (not that I normally notice floor décor, this was just a particular eye-sore), with staff running in every direction while annoying too-loud Bollywood music plays. One thing I noticed is that everything is served on Styrofoam plates, why on earth is this a thing? They are clearly doing well enough to pay for some plates and to hire a dishwasher. Can you imagine just how much waste that is? It took 25 minutes to receive our food, so I hoped the waiting time would mean it was fresh.   Here's what you're waiting for, the make or (in this case) break: THE FOOD. I can forgive pretty much anything if the food is amazing. However. The Naan was rubber. Like actual, hard to rip, microwaved, what you expect from discounted grocery store naan. Actually, that's an insult to packaged naan. It's an insult to the word 'naan'. These rubber discs wouldn't even soak up the butter chicken sauce after sitting in it for minutes. MINUTES. And the butter chicken sauce? More like separated oil and terribly spiced sauce. It was flat tasting; I can't even call it one dimensional because it lacked any dimensions at all. Literally every jarred butter chicken sauce is better than this. We haven't even talked about the chicken, all 6 small pieces of it (again, for $15 I expect at least a full servings worth of meat) and every single one was the driest, blandest chicken I have had in a very long time. And if you read my reviews, dry meat is something I often criticize. I would rather eat all of those dried meats before ever stepping foot in this place again.   Now there are a lot of bad reviews here, but also some good ones. I'm assuming (and really hoping) this was a very bad example of their normal dish. But who has the nerve to serve this to anyone? You can see the pictures I posted. I was extremely disappointed eating this, and writing this review has brought back that terrible taste in my mouth. There are some amazing restaurants on Gerrard serving up authentic and delicious food, but they go out of business while this place gets featured on some national TV show?? What is wrong with this picture?  The only good things I can say: the servers were nice and helpful, even at the end of a busy Friday shift, AND (look two things!) the washrooms were nice."}
{"text":"We went for a late dinner with some friends and when I say late, I mean, 45 minutes before closing. The staff was so accommodating and friendly.  For the four of us, we got 3 naans, one order of Nihari (beef chunks in a stew), haleem (a dish made of slow cooked meat, lentils and spices) and a Kashmiri tea.  The food portions were generous and we were quite stuffed.  Nihari: the beef was so tender and the flavor really penetrated the chunks with the naan soaking up all the delicious sauce.  Haleem: although we couldn't find it on the menu, the waiter said they had it and it was better than expected. The meat, lentils and spices were cooked so long that they had blended into each other. It was soooo good. I would recommend asking for some fresh ginger, cilantro and lime on the side to freshen it up a bit. Still, quite delicious.  The waiters bring by chill is that are grilled and salted. One of the 4 got a spicy one but they are generally 'jalapeño' level of spice if you're ok with that. There is a bottle of yoghurt sauce and tamarind sauce on the table that I would imagine goes well with biryani or samosas. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Arrived 9pm Saturday night. Place was packed. We gave our names and had a beer across the street - back at 930 and seated in the basement. Don't let the plastic furniture and cutlery fool you. When the food started arriving we knew we were in for a real sweet treat. Felt like we had been transported abroad. Such a cool place. Customers from all walks of life. We ate kabobs - chicken was especially awesome. Hot and grilled perfectly. Tikka chicken also amazing - boneless. Eggplant with naan so tasty. Butter chicken had a nice creamy spice to it. Service was great. Multiple waiters running around and always making sure we had what we wanted. There was an older, stern looking female maitre'd tut-tutting in the corner who affectionately kept the staff busy and on their toes haha we will be back! One of the city's best for Indian. Places like this make me glad to live in Toronto - we are spoilt with so many great choices for food!  Update - went last night for the old man's 69th b day - the Hara (green) chicken is really next level. No future visits of mine will happen without us ordering this dish. We also tried the Nihari Beef. Very tender meat with a flavourful gravy. The BBQ kababs are still to die for. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"Great experience.  I came here on a Saturday, shortly after 2:00, there were plenty of seats.  As another reviewer mentioned you are seated first, given a menu, and you place your order with the cashier, who gives you a number to put on your table.  Your server offers you drinks, and eventually brings the food.  Service was extremely efficient and friendly.  We had the sizzling chicken with mint sauce, the king fish in a stew, vegetable samosas, garlic naan, and the dal and spinach.  Everything was very good.  Nothing was over-spiced.  I look forward to eating here again!  Oh, and the styrofoam plate thing, if you're knocking off points for that you're a complete fascist.  Part of the outside appeared to be under some kind of construction, but it did not affect anything.  We had mango lassis for dessert.  Go here right away."}
{"text":"Food = overly oily    Chicken karai has no chicken meat, just bones     Salad = oily lettuce  Dishes = all disposable  Service = horrible ... No waiter ever knows whats going on  Washroom = good, last i checked  Environment = uncomfortable with plastic chairs and portables  Oh and ... Are they still renovating??? Its a joke; i think they're too cheap to finish the reno because its generating enough cash as is. Why? I think its all got to do with location and name: their food and service used to be good, but that was years ago. Plus, there are a lot of visitors in the area because it is Toronto's most popular desi bazaar... So a lot of their customers don't know how bad the food is or don't care because they just want a desi environment.  I pay for: good food and good service. This place has neither. So i asked myself: what am i tipping for when there is bad service? And what am i paying the bill for when the food is not good? Then it became obvious: if you care about using a good washroom over and above good food and service, go for it!  Otherwise, i recommend Tandoori Time ( highway 27 and Albion)  Thanks"}
{"text":"Very casual and they give you plastic cutlery. It is set up like a fast food order place but prices dont reflect the very casual and average tasting food. While the lamb kebab (ground meat) were flavorful the chicken were bland. The eggplant bhartha was more like a oily fried onion dish. Wasnt impressed with the overall cleanliness either. Pass."}
{"text":"I brought my wife to go and try this restaurant and we came out very disappointed with the service. As soon as we received our order, my wife spotted a hair in her order which was the  chicken biryani. She showed it to the waitress who took it away without any apology or trying to make amends for the bad experience.  One of the hostesses who was there was going from table to table asking how things were. When we asked her about our situation , she flatly said that she doesn't deal with situations like that in a rude way and told us it's a management issue. Finally , the manager came to see us and as we expressed our disappointment about what happened, he showed the nylon mesh  on his hair and says that everyone wears such a mesh and he expresses doubt how such a thing could happen. While many of the employees had a mesh on the hair, it was obvious that some of the females with long hair could not possibly have all their hair contained by the small mesh. But the point was that he was not apologetic about what happened and was implying that we were lying about it.  I did try to get the attention of several people who work there about this and it always came back to the manager guy who didn't want to apologize. While he did finally apologize, he didn't want to make any amends about what happened.  Which left us with no choice to report this review about what happened to warn people what they can expect if something similar happens to them.  It's their mistake and they were not even apologetic at first, trying to put the blame on us. When  we finally made some noise about it, they were still reluctant to make any amends . I will certainly not recommend such a place that  that lacks customer service.  They say that you really discover what customer service is really like when trouble happens. Well, we found out and we're not going back there."}
{"text":"Is this place still under construction? The Taj Mahal took less time to build. The last time I went I had the pleasure of dining in what seemed to be a \"dolled up\" construction trailer. We ate on paper plates and used plastic cutlery. Water was served from 25 year-old plastic jugs surely infused with lead. But I can deal with all that. The worse part was the food. Just greasy and basic and hardly worth the streetcar ride. It's edible but there are so many better options in this city. A surprising let down for a restaurant in the heart of Little India.  Obligatory Title Pun: This place is LAHORE-rible.  Menu Readability: I don't remember but it was probably written in crayon on a piece of oil-stained cardboard.  Need to mention: The washrooms (which are in the \"new\" building) are fantastic.  What this place teaches me about myself: If I sound harsh, it's because I love Indian food. Consider this tough love."}
{"text":"The food I tried was just okay.  Palak paneer was not very flavourful. The cheese cubes were cut too large as none of the flavour got into the middle of the cubes.   Lamb curry was flavourful, but the pieces of lamb were on the tough side.  Garlic naan was great. The bread came out fresh, piping & delicious.  Rice was okay and plain, but served in a surprisingly small portion for the price.  Portions in general are not large. It seems a little overpriced here, especially for the rice.  Service is so-so. Service was slow & they made mistakes with our order. (It wasn't very busy when we were there.)"}
{"text":"Food quality has changed over the last 10 years and customer service. Food was really good. My recent visit was terrible as food was tasteless and cold"}
{"text":"The main reason I come here is for their beef sheek kabobs and the naan.  Other than that the menu is just average. Pissed me off last time because now you have to apparently pay for the cut up lettuce that was once complementary.    Their decor is weird as hell, it's just indian saris hung everywhere and used as table cloths, and I swear to God this place has been under construction since the year 2000.  I think they should honestly invest in REAL plates and cutlery, and not serve people with disposable plates and cutlery.  They should also buy real chairs, not plastic lawn chairs.  This is a restaurant, not a meal at a big house party.  Last time I was there I saw that they finally upgraded from personally taking your order to the front cash, to using whiteboards to write your order on...so weird.  Also, the temperature of this place is always messed up.  You are either shivering from the lack of heat in the winter, or sweltering in the heat during the summer. THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN.  If you come here, also prepare to leave smelling like curry because as soon as you set foot inside you are done for, so carry some body spray.    All in all, the food is decent, but guaranteed something else will annoy you during your visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Don't expect this place to be fancy, but the food won't disappoint! My recommendations are the lamb Nihari, garlic naan, and beef skewers. For dessert, the pistachio Kulfi ice cream is the best!"}
{"text":"Get your tikka on, get your get your get your get your tikka on! *Drops mic. Okay so I'm going to give a shoutout to the food here because it was fantastic on the night that we went. I did hear this place can be a hit or miss sometimes but they delivered and I've got to give my applause. Let me rewind this track for you and take it back to the beginning...  Boom, sh, boom ba boom shh...  Woke up quick at about noon, just thought that I had to get to Tikkah house soon...I've got to get some tikka before my day begins, before my stomach starts aching and  churning again. Walked in fly, party of 8, soon as I smelled everything, I knew it would be great. Waiter comes over asking what would you like.. so we order the goods and by goods I mean kabob plate, beef short ribs, gol guppay, and you know it...chicka chicka chicken tikka!  Got my naan and then it got crazy even though I was full I wasn't getting lazy. Now there were some issues so I'm deducting a star, leaving the yogurt out in squirt bottles doesn't get far... with me, because you see I feel like that's a hazard, yogurt can go bad, nobody wants their stomach mad. Napkins were slim, hands got dirty, food like this you need at least 30. Okay maybe not 30 but at least enough to not keep reusing the same tired stuff. I would come back if I'm back here again, tell everyone, bring your friends.   *Boom sh boom ba boom sh"}
{"text":"If \"The Host\" is the pinnacle of fine dining in Toronto, Lahore Tikka House is at the other end of the spectrum - while they won't win any awards for their decor (still under construction after many months), their Ukrainian summer camp/beer garden outdoor dining area or plastic cutlery and styrofoam plates, they most certainly win accolades for dishing up spicy, tangy and toothsome South Asian cuisine.   By the time you've finished butchering your pronunciation of the dishes on the menu, the super friendly server has already communicated your order (via telekinesis or ESP, I don't know) to the kitchen staff and the ball is rolling. No joke, food for our group of ten people was in front of our snouts within five minutes. There were a lot of vegetarian options and while the food was good, it wasn't fabulous. I have had better Indian food in this city - although perhaps I just didn't like the style of the sauce. It wasn't wet enough for me. I like my sauce wet, people. Got it?  Fantastic for groups. I daresay you could bring a party of 100 here and the staff wouldn't even flinch.   Delicious kolfi for dessert (signature flavour made in-house, the rest made by Kolfi King) was a welcome break from all the hot, flavourful food. But I'm still in a funk because the Kolfi King himself still hasn't replied to any of my emails."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Lahore Tikka last night. By far, the worse experience for ethnic food. They don't always pick up the phone, they close earlier than advertised. On the bright side, their voicemail is always on.   Nevertheless, we ordered and we come back home to find one bug in the inari(beef Stew) walking around without a worry in the world. I was deeply disgusted and we threw the box out immediately.   I would not recommend going there for food or takeout."}
{"text":"I wanted to enjoy authentic Indian cuisine and after a recommendation tried Lahore. It was different than any other Indian food experience. The food was oily, all the dishes we tried tasted the same and the atmosphere was non-existent (open rafters, plastic plates and utensils, picnic tables and chairs). The prices are a bit high considering the quality of the food.  I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Great spicy Indian food. Very tasty. I recommend the Kirachi Ghost (lamb) was amazing."}
{"text":"Some days the sleeping Lahori inside of wakes up and compels me to go to Lahore Tikka House.  Sometimes, you just gotta have Kabab and Tikka just the way it is supposed to be done, and as far as authentic Lahori/Pakistani cuisine is concerned, Lahore Tikka House is The Best in Toronto.  While they do have some non-authentic fusion dishes to appease the North American palate looking for \"Indian food\" (e.g. Butter Chicken), if you are looking for authentic Pakistani BBQ, go for the Kabobs (Chicken, Lamb, Beef).   They are served hot on sizzling plates with toppings of caramelized onions and green chillies.  Their Biryani rice are also awesome.  Now don't expect a fine dining experience.  The place has been under construction since before I have known it (more than 8 years).  At the moment its a makeshift arrangement with two trailers connected to their primary building.  You sit on plastic chairs next to fold-away tables, and eat from paper plates.    None of that matters though if I have to have my Lahori BBQ."}
{"text":"They were out of all white meat options... which was the purpose of my being there. We then ordered the afghani tikka instead only to get scraps of chicken thighs which were 90% bone. The beef boti tikka we ordered had to be sent back because it was cold. They didn't have butter chicken, they didn't have mango lassi... all very disappointing! We did order Dhal and beef kebabs which were good but overall it was a negative experience from what we are used to. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place because of the chicken tikka masala and the kabobs and ooh the Ribs!!!  However, last few times i feel like the food is not made to order anymore. As if its just warmed up....definitely felt like that with Ribs today! A lil disappointed! :(. I will probably still come back for the chicken tikka and naan!"}
{"text":"Three stars for the experience. I wish I could give this more stars because I loved my waiter, the decorations, and the bathroom, but I'd be lying if I said this more than an OK meal.  My dad was visiting from out of town and wanted Indian food and over to Gerrard we go. I had another restaurant in mind, but as Lahore Tikka House is like the official \"Welcome to Little India\" landmark and I had never been before, we opted for this seemingly small, quirky joint.  Lahora Tikka House is an institution. They have more space than you think, the most ridiculous bathroom I can recall (all the money they saved on styrofoam plates went into the bathroom tiling and auto-sensor toilets), and some items that are apparently synonymous with the restaurant itself, like kofti and Thumbs Up (ice cream and a soft drink, respectively).  My dad and I ordered a samosa, three types of naan, a mixed vegetable platter, the paneer (cheese) tikka masala, and gulab jamun (a desert). Don't order the samosas unless you want a sad sack of fried dough stuffed with stuff presented to you on a sterile-looking styrofoam plate or have a specific idea of how a samosa should be (like my dad).  The naan was good. I thought I was fairly Hindi-savvy when it came to ordering food but I learned that \"till\" means \"sesame\" and that butter till naan is AMAZING. The garlic naan was good but that's all.  The paneer tikka masala was my favourite item because it's just chunks of cheese in delicious sauce. You can't really go wrong with this. A nice touch were the green bits floating around, although we couldn't identify them. Onion shoots? Who knows. And cilantro is always, always a good thing.  The mixed vegetable plate was OK. I didn't really go near it because it just wasn't as good as it looked. A bit too oily, but more uninspired than anything else.  The gulab jamun was fantastic! They're little fried balls of dough, like churros and donuts, soaked in a syrup. You have to buy it at the front because LTH has a weird system where they give you a menu but constantly make you get up to pay and add to your bill. But it also exposes you to their desserts and drinks, yum.  But you don't go to LTH for the food. You go for the people and the amazing decor. Being that it is a Pakistani restaurant, there were a lot of colourful hijabs and salwars (clothing items) but also a diverse clientele. I think this equally surprised the waiter because when we asked him what beverages there are, he listed \"Mango shake\" but my dad didn't catch what he said, so I prompted him. \"Mango lassi, Dad,\" to which our server was quite impressed! But that's basic Indian food 101.  As for the decor, just look at the pictures. And take pictures of the place yourself - they have some cool items in their foyer, including a certificate of appreciation from an Afghani orphanage."}
{"text":"The Pakistani palace of Little India is my new everything.   Somehow, in my 30-something year love affair with paneer I had managed to accidentally avoid LTH. That came to an end last Saturday when four friends and two babies (one in utero, one shaking up the scene in TO) decided a feast was in order.   We showed up to the colourful chaos around 8pm, put our name in and were told the wait would be around 20 minutes. We scooted across the street to Jenny's for a quick beer (Lahore Tikka House does not serve alcohol), and were back moments before our name was called. We were then ushered to our table in the plastic tent where we set up camp for the long haul. Claw high chair was attached, menus were skimmed...and then we pretty much just ordered everything, and we went to town.   Stand out dishes include: +Lamb kebobs +Tandoori fish +Veg samosas... a bit obvious, but they do 'em so well! +Pani puri  +Salt lassi... only for you truly salty and sour lovin' lads and lassis   This place is busy and definitely not fine dining, but if you're after a fun night of food with a kick, tika tika over to Lahore Tikka House."}
{"text":"Let's get down you little lahore you...sort of ghetto which is precisely why I come here. We ordered a few items but I stuck to the tandoor.  We got the lamb and beef kabobs as well as an order of butter chicken and garlic naan.  Kabobs were great!  The butter chicken was oily but good.  Garlic naan to die for. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Since I was brought to this resto, I find myself craving for it occasionally....  Lots of goodies on the menu.... Lamb chops and Biryanis are my fave!! Try their imported drinks to add to the experience!! Oh, talk about speed.... You place an order at the front, sit down and within 10 minutes, your food is served (HOT and SUPER TASTY!!)  I have never been to Pakistan, but this is authentic all right (so I've been told).  I'm going back, for shizzzzle!"}
{"text":"Best naan anywhere. Do not go without ordering their naan!! We absolutely love their butter chicken. Our classic order is two butter naan with the butter chicken and this is the right amount for two people without overdoing it.  I've only taken one star off because we would love to order the rice but it's so blinking expensive (even though they do give you a lot - better value for 4 people and still enough rice).   The chicken and beef kebabs are quite good as well. We never begrudge ordering a kebab or two if we go in extra hungry!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best food Ive eaten in Toronto. After a brief wait we got seated and then the food was out in no time. The place has a nice ambience and is packed at both levels. The food is very well spiced and absolutely tasty. The service is remarkable for such huge crowds."}
{"text":"When you ask for a side of hot peppers, they bring you a skewer of fire roasted peppers. This is a lively place and you can see what goes on in the kitchen. Good food, good people. Women's washroom features a change table for baby and a small sitting area (potentially for discreet breast feeding, but really, if baby is hungry, feed the little one anywhere you are both comfortable)."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The Nihari was excellent Don't forget to order their Hara Chicken. I love this item  Quick and very good service. Food comes out pretty fast. Tastes delicious. If you like spicy, try their grilled green chilies Great place"}
{"text":"Anyone coming to visit the Lahore Tikka House should read this review first:  First of all a lot of people keep saying in there reviews this place doesn't taste like authentic Indian food. And that is because it's not Indian its PAKISTANI cuisine so duh that's why. It's also halal so there is no liquor here either.  Secondly all food comes out family style and you are given styrofoam plates & cups, paper napkins and plastic cutlery to eat with, you are seated at long plastic folding tables on black plastic patio chairs - so if you have a problem with that than don''t come here.  Thirdly this place is ridiculously busy and usually has a lot of large families coming to dine - busy is a good thing meaning people keep coming back - if that's a problem for you either come during off times - do not come at prime time such as 5-7pm - or stay home  Fourthly yes your clothes and hair and everything will stink of spice after - it can be easily reversed by taking a shower/doing laundry or staying home - you decide  Fifthly the ordering process is a tad confusing for a first timer but very simple - see my review for details  On to my review...  My family of 5 came in on a Sunday afternoon around 4:30pm so the place was just starting to really get full. The host kindly greeted us when we came in and took us to a table right in the front beside the glass window. Since they weren't that busy yet he let us take over two tables. I was afraid sitting right beside the front door as it I thought I would feel cold but over top our table was the heat vent so were all nice and warm.  A waiter came over with menus shortly, took our drink orders and explained the ORDERING PROCESS: Once you've decided what you want to order you go over to the cashier and place your order. Then the cashier will give you a table number to place on your table so servers know where to bring your food. After your initial order with the cashier, if you want to order anything else you can place it with your waiter. At the end of your meal you go back to the cashier and pay your full bill with her.  After returning to the table after placing our food order the waiter brought over are drinks - FYI they serve canned pop - He also brought us a jug of water, a stack of styrofoam plates & cups, paper napkins and plastic cutlery along with a little plate of salad and dressings.  After a 10-15 minute wait our food started to come out.  Everything came out very hot, fresh and delicious - you can steam coming off all of the food  Here's a run down of what we ordered:  Vegetable Samosa - thin crispy pastry packed full of potatoes and peas well seasoned Lahori Beef Kabab - spicy ground beef formed kebab cooked in the tandoor Tandoori Chicken Leg 1/4 pcs - Loved this very good juicy pieces of bone in chicken Butter Chicken - very rich and creamy with chunks of white meat -another favourite Chicken Biryani - asked for it extra spicy/hot and it was really hit the spot it flavours! Huge portion but our family of 5 devoured most of - also big chunks of chicken with bones and white meat Aloo Gobi - my favourite vegetarian dish - huge pieces of cauliflower and potatoes great curry flavour Channa Masala - another favourite vegetarian dish - nicely spiced and tender cooked masala chickpeas Chicken Tikka Breast 5pcs - dry spiced cooked tender chicken morsels again really good Garlic Naan - amazingly good - soo soft great garlic flavour and huge but don't under-estimate it - you'll need at minimum 1-2 per person  Overall every single dish we tasted we loved! Tips when ordering - if you like it spicy and food with heat tell the cashier when ordering to make the dish extra spicy/hot they will deliver. Yes things are on the greasy side however everything was soo rich in flavour and spice and soo fresh and hot it did not take away from anything. If your of the health conscious kind - again do not come then. Service was soo great, all the waiters were attentive and helpful asking us if we needed anything else. They even helped us wrap up our left overs.  After reading my review if you have no problems with any of the above I highly recommend you try it out because you will leave here overly satisfied!"}
