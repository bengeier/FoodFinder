{"text":"Yummy treats, inviting atmosphere and lovely owner/staff. A great example of a neighbourhood hangout.

There was a homeless gentleman who walked in and clearly suffering from mental health issues. They were kind to him, and when I offered to buy him anything he wanted, the staff mentioned they pack him a goodie bag everyday so refused to take my money."}
{"text":"SO. GOOD. 

Seriously I almost wish it wasn't so good because I'm constantly buying their tarts. RIP my diet.

Usually with tarts they're often too sweet, especially pecan tarts -- but the tarts here are perfect! 

The options depend on the season. I've had pretty much every type at least once since I started coming here and they've all been really good. My personal favorite is the apple caramel walnut(?) tart.

Price wise, it's a little more expensive than other bakeries in the area, but you really get what you pay for. The price doesn't seem to deter me from spoiling myself more often than I should."}
{"text":"Came in in a rainy morning and so glad did! Seriously one if the best cinnamon buns I've ever had! The owner bakes everything fresh everyday and this small, cute cafe is filled with the smells of fresh baked pastries. Definitely great to support local businesses and everyone should come and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great little bakery in an upcoming area.
I got the wonderful opportunity to try different delicious items this cute little cafe has.  Firstly, all items are handmade by the owner.  I also discovered she handpicks all the organic ingredients on a regular basis.  Items change on a regular basis and they make delicious baked goods based on what is fresh.
Secondly, they make delicious and health conscience items that cater to vegans.  I'm not a vegan, but I do have a gluten allergy so I was relived and delighted to find a wide selection of gluten free assortments which were delicious!
I highly recommend to come and hangout, enjoy a rum cake and an organic latte on a cold day and take advantage of their free wifi!"}
{"text":"Discovered this small bakery during a recent stroll in the area. Fell in love with the brownie. It's probably the best I've ever had. Serious!! Not too rich or fatty or too sweet
With caramel and salt. Yummy.  They also serve good drip coffee. This little cafe and bakery definitely surprised me. It doesn't look too special on the outside or inside but the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"My wife has a sugar allergy and the cake was amazing! 2nd nature did a test cake for us to see if her sugar free concoction would be good. Her family said yes and so did she! I ordered the cake and my wife and all my in laws ate it up! They loved it! I don't like cake or chocolate but I even ate it! Top notch customer service, getting my 3 year olds Thomas the Tank Engine cake there tomorrow."}
