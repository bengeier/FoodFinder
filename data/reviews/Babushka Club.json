{"text":"Nice place to have a birthday party. The staff is very attentive and professional. The food is very good, my favorite is lamb.   
The ambiance is modern unlike other Russian restaurants.
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party, food was mediocre at best. Service was good but it was overly expensive for what you receive."}
{"text":"Expect closing at 1:00 AM , basically as you know they put slow music, just leave. Dance floor is way too small ! Food is OK ! Service is good! Entertaining some way !"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, the music is out-dated, entertainment non-existent.

Simple roasted potatoes were over-salted and practically swimming in oil. I only liked their chicken pie, it was moist and perfectly seasoned, baked in puff pastry. Makes me doubt they baked it themselves. Meet stew with mashed potatoes inside a bread bun was an interesting way of serving, however the meat disappointed with its chewy texture, the flavor was not too bad. Creme brulee could have easily been called mannaya kasha.
Their choice of music was outdated and the few non-Russian song were played from a disc. They showed weird music clips on the projector screen, including 3D computer dancers, like the avatars from IMVU )))
Also the light fixtures are too bright and blind you while you're trying to eat at your table."}
