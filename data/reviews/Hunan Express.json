{"text":"I picked up my order and went home. I ate the crab and so Chicken and rice and got so sick I had to call off work. I was sick all night until 5 in the morning. I contacted the store and all he could say was no one else called. So people don't call. I owned a restaurant so I know what should have been done. I took that phone number out of my phone."}
{"text":"We've ordered takeout from Hunan Express a couple times since moving to Aurora. It is definitely much better than the other Chinese restaurant we tried takeout from. Thumbs up for inexpensive, yummy Chinese takeout. :D"}
{"text":"Tsu how, boo how?  That's phonetic Mandarin for \"did I like the food,\" because I can't remember the little Kanji pictures to write it out.  I think one of them is a plus, a slash, two dots and a cheeseburger.

I liked the food.  It wasn't typical slop cafeteria style Chinese.  Of course it wasn't real Chinese either.  But it was good quality, tasty and inexpensive for what you got.  I ordered General Tso's Chicken- $7.50, pot stickers- $4.95 and a Pepsi, (in a bottle, no fountain.)  I got a shrimp egg roll too.  I found two brine shrimp in it.

They asked me how spicy I wanted the chicken.  I said medium.  It was not hot at all.  I've had spicier breakfast cereal than their medium.  But the chicken was all breast meat and the rice was not Uncle Ben's.  I hate getting Louisiana rice in a Szechuan dish.  Just like I would hate getting Botan in my jambalaya.  The potstickers were typical.  Filled with cabbage and there could have been some meat somewhere- not sure though. On previous occasions I've had the Ma Po, $9.50 and the Curry Chicken, $10.50.  They were served like soup and in my opinion, looked and tasted very soupy.  Very bland and uninteresting- just a bunch of onion.

One thing: there's a movie theater next door.  This place will probably not be a good date night location.  There's  two tables and some bar stools, and are probably meant for waiting instead of dining.  I don't believe they'll kick you out for trying to dine in like what would happen to you in a Chinese take away in London, but if you're a fat guy like me, you and a date may not fit."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today, first time in years and now I remember why. The dining area was dirty and disheveled. I ordered sweet and sour chicken lunch combo. The fried rice was the most bland and mushy I have ever had. The chicken was way overbreaded. The sweet and sour sauce had decent flavor but was far to thin and watery. Overall I would say definitely pass on eating here there are much better options for Chinese takeout or dine in within a few miles of here."}
{"text":"I only went to this place based on the two reviews here.  Aurora is not a place known for its chinese food but I wanted to try it.

I had the moo goo gai pan and fried rice...I will go back but the first attempt was average and bland."}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese at best. Very bland, order wrong, smaller portions for take out quart sized. 

Other quick take out Chinese restaurants in Aurora are far superior, tastier, and overall just better."}
{"text":"Chicken Pad Thai is my favorite here! They also have lots of other great options. Always quick service!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to order Chinese from since we moved to Aurora. They are always very polite and orders are always ready in about 15-20 minutes. The food is tasty with our favorites being the Mongolian Beef, General Tso's Chicken(Mild), and the beef lo mein."}
{"text":"We love Hunan Express. Friendly guy at the front, very fast and good food for the price. We eat takeout from here a couple times a month."}
{"text":"This is one of our easy to access Chinese takeout places and we love it here. No bells and whistles, just good food at a super reasonable price. I know there are places to sit here, but the restaurant itself is usually filled with people getting takeout food. We are strict lo Mein fans and also Cashew chicken fans and as a result, these are the go to's for my family. My nieces love eating the spring rolls and also the wonton soup--a bit too spicy for me. The place is staffed with friendly people and always very clean. Parking is ample and it is never hard to get in and out. Love it here and suggest anyone try it for their Chinese fix."}
