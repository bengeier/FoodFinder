{"text":"I would this place negative stars if I could, however, 1 is as low as it gets. After waiting a literal hour for our food, mine didn't come out, it was all cold. 1 hour and 15 minutes into it I had yet to receive food. My fruit salad had a lemon in it? From the food, to the service this place will have its door closed soon."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Asked for egg whites instead of regular eggs and they flat out said no we don't do that!  What kind of restaurant won't take out the egg yolks for you? When I looked at the menu for something healthy like fruit. Nothing. 
Not going back. Wake up!  It's 2016. Not everyone wants to eat greasy bacon and fried potatoes for breakfast!  Some of us don't want to be 50 lbs overweight! Won't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"1 hour! That is how long we waited from the time we placed our order until our food was delivered. We received bland and unseasoned  eggs and grits, burnt pancakes, and stale biscuits. The bacon was great. That was it though.  It was only my husband and I  so I expected breakfast to take 15 minutes. One couple left. We made friends with our other starving table neighbors. The poor waitress kept apologizing. It was overall a horrific experience. I told the waitress of a place nearby that was hiring because I'm sure with the lack of turnover she can't be making much money. Left a message for the manager to call me back. We will see if that happens. Either way, never going back. The kitchen manager should be fired."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, stopped after church for the last few Sundays. We really enjoyed, friendly help fast service ."}
{"text":"This place is busy! People are loving it. Newly opened home cooked Southern food restaurant serving breakfast and lunch with daily specials. Desserts are prepared in house from scratch and are really good. Fries are hand cut and in my daughter's words: \"to die for\".  There is a salad on the menu with spring mix if you're looking for something light and healthy. Most of the menu is soul food and breakfast items, so if you're looking for a Whole Foods, make the drive there but don't leave a 1 star review for this place bc you were expecting diet food to be available and it wasn't. Staff is friendly and attentive, has a nice covered patio area outside, inside table seating, and a counter. Clean and open feeling inside with high ceilings. A TV is going to be above the counter soon so you don't have to miss the game to have lunch. Can't wait to try some more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch around 2 pm. It took 35 minutes after our order was taken was it served . The meal was average At best. Our waitress was taking out the garbage as she was serving customers and never washing her hands. The cooking staff was wandering through the restaurant wiping their faces, noses, & mouths with their hands while going to the ice machine for their drinking cups. Their was no manager present. When the bill came they wanted to charge me more for the food than we ordered."}
{"text":"Very poorly managed.
Young and nice staff.
Management believes in insulting staff.
Asked if they had maple syrup, basically the reponse was that their sugar syrup was better.
Asked for butter not margarine and was told that they wished people from SUn City would stay away"}
{"text":"Had breakfast on Sunday with friends

They now will be open for dinner I was told
Put in a great bar with plenty of TV's 
Looks good for sports 
Will go back"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast around 730 am .
The waitress was very friendly and attentive. We ordered eggs, over easy and sunny side up. I easily substituted tomatoes for grits or home fries. I also ordered a buttered bagel. Eggs were cooked  nicely to order. My bagel tasted like a supermarket variety and  unbuttered and the waitress gave me  pats of butter when  I asked for butter. My dining mates homefries were crispy, tasted like they were deep fried, good but unseasoned. Food came out plated nicely and hot. Note we were the only customers beside another person in the place.
The decor was nice and the restaurant clean. The waitress offered us a coffee refill to go. The prices reasonable and breakfast and lunch menu with good variety plus a daily special blackboard.
I would go back and try something from the lunch menu."}
{"text":"The waitress was friendly however the food was disappointing. The eggs were soaked in butter/oil and I had to send them back in an attempt to get medium/well eggs. They still came over easy. The grits were runny and the corn beef hash less then appealing. We will not be back."}
{"text":"meh.
The omelet was kind of boring although the potatoes were tasty. service was good  and the food came out pretty quick. out drinks were kept full. outside seating was a delight! 
The hubs had a biscuit sandwich and the biscuit was a little flat, he opened it and ate the meat inside. he enjoyed his hash browns."}
{"text":"We have been many times before and never had an issue. This morning we went for breakfast and the service was horrible. We barely got our drinks and then we were told the waitress would be right with us. 10 minutes later, she still hadn't waited on us, but waited on two other couples that came in after us. Sorry, no excuse for bad customer service. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Had an omelette.  It was extremely greasy, too much black pepper.  The hash browns were grey in color and did not taste fresh.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"We have been a few times.  Food was good , not great.  Last weekend my wife ordered a cheese omelet.  It was terrible.  Generic sliced cheese created a plastic taste and texture.    May never go again"}
{"text":"Some reviews said it's busy, but there was 1 guy at a table, and 1 guy at the counter at lunchtime? Should have gone with my instincts and left right then...

The waitress was very nice. It went all downhill from there. 

I had an Egg, Cheese, Bacon Sandwich, on a bagel.
Terrible, no other way to describe it. Egg was omelette style, thin, cold and cheese was not melted. Bacon was dry, burnt, pieces that had been sitting around for a while. Half the bagel was slightly toasted/grilled, but the other half was not? The Bagel was obviously a very cheap, frozen grocery store brand. Worst breakfast sandwich I've ever had, McDonalds probably has better. 

My wife's 2 eggs over-medium were fine. The \"Homemade\" Biscuit. I asked if it was Homemade to be sure. Well a picture is worth a thousand words.  Burnt on top . Hard on the bottom. Disgusting inedible. You have to be a real lazy, uncaring staff to serve that, both the Cook (Just  got out of prison, crackhead looking dude)  and the waitress (brunette) who brought it over.  If that was homemade, burn down your home and slap your mama for even feeding you that Garbage. 

Both of us had Homefries. Just cut up symmetric cubes of potatoes (so uniformly cut they had to be frozen also) deep fried and very crisp. Lazy, unappetizing, calorie-laden way to make breakfast potatoes but that seems to sum up the whole place. Lazy. 

No one asked us how our food was. Never saw someone who resembled a Manager. When we went to the cashier, she yawned at me a few times and didn't ask either, she was very sleepy, I felt bad bothering her. 

The whole thing reminded me of the beginning of an episode of Ramseys Kitchen Nightmares. 

Spend a few extra bucks, go to Toast down the road or Stacks in Waxhaw. The 5 star reviews below, I suspect they are friends/staff/fake because the Owners of this place obviously haven't a clue."}
{"text":"I drive 30 minutes to Freebirds just so I can get a real American meal. The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is awesome. It's exactly what you could want from a Family restaurant. The owner is a solid guy who will check on you to make sure you're completely satisfied with your visit. They have affordable specials and the food is always on point. Indoor and outdoor seating is available and the parking lot has plenty of wide open spaces even during the busiest times. Definitely one of my favorites in the area. Check it out."}
