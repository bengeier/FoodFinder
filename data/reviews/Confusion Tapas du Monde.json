{"text":"Que de découvert à Montréal. Une cuisine originale et délicieuse.  Des tapas du monde, avec notamment : tartare de saumon, de canard et de boeuf un vrai régal. Service impeccable, lieux original sur deux étages. Je recommande vivement"}
{"text":"Pros : Delicious food and great service make this place a must. The staff was full of attention, although it was crowded. My girlfriend and I love the duck. Cons: It's pretty tight and you don't have much space for yourself, we were almost sit over other tables."}
{"text":"Service impecable, nourriture excellente, service rapide bonne ambiance et les prix sont tres raisonable"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great staff and great service. Pre-set Tapas menu option was on the mark for our group of four."}
{"text":"Arrived without a reservation on a busy Sat night so had to sit at the bar upstairs.  But no worries cause the service and the food was great.  Had fresh oysters to start then shared the duck, lamb and puff pastry.  All uniquely flavored and tasty.  Portions are small for the price but with a half liter of wine, we spent $100 with tip.  Not cheap but great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Les tapas, le vin, le service, le décor, le plaisir d'y déguster de l'entrée au dessert!!!!! On y retourne des dizaines de fois!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the recommendation of the concierge at my hotel and had an absolutely fantastic time.  He sold us on the choice when he mentioned the signature \"swing seats\". I was worried that it would be unsettled by the constant rocking back and forth of the seat, but I loved it.  The atmosphere is a nice mix of classy with fun and this translated to the food as well.  I had a fantastic foie gras that was extremely rich and flavorful...exactly how I like it! The arugula and beet salad was fantastic as was everything else we had that night.  I was really excited to see that the Spanish tapas concept was being applied to French cuisine.  It makes it easy to try a wide variety of different things and experiment.  Definitely recommend heading here the next time you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"En novembre dernier avait lieu la première édition de MTL à Table, organisé par Tourisme Montréal et qui regroupait une centaine de restos du 514. L'opération avait pour but de promouvoir ces derniers et attirer les touristes, dans cette période plus creuse de l'année, en offrant des tables d'hôtes à prix réduit. En plus de nous faire découvrir l'excellent Verses, on en a surtout profité de l'événement pour revisiter Confusion Tapas du Monde.   BOUFFE  Pour avoir été à Confusion auparavant, histoire de souligner une occasion spéciale, on avait de grandes attentes en y retournant pour MTL à Table. Outre le menu complet, nous avions le choix d'une table d'hôte à 29$, incluant soupe, entrée, repas et dessert.  On a débuté avec un potage de patates douces arrosé d'huile de menthe, une des meilleures soupes que j'aie mangées à ce jour. +1  Un onctueux tartare de saumon, garni d'avocats et surmonté d'une huître Malpeque.  Légère déception pour la salade de roquette, peu de vinaigrette et de feta. Mais bon, ça m'apprendra à commander de la salade en entrée.  En plat principal, je ne pouvais pas passer à côté de calmars grillés farcis à la merguez. La farce à la merguez était très bien assaisonnée  et se mariait à merveille avec la tendre chair des calmars grillés.  L'onglet de buf quant à lui était surprenamment petit, comparé aux autres photos de bloggeurs que j'avais vu. Toutefois, les lentilles en accompagnement étaient succulentes et la salade en à-côté, avait plus de vinaigrette que celle en entrée...  Ensuite, nous sommes allés pour une assiette de canard croustillant, qui n'était pas dans la table d'hôte. Accompagné de sauce hoisin et de tortillas, c'est le plat idéal à partager.  Pour terminer cette excellente soirée, nous nous sommes délectés d'un fondant au chocolat servi avec une glace caramel à la fleur de sel.   AMBIANCE/SERVICE  Chaque fois qu'un ami me demande une suggestion de place où aller, pour une occasion spéciale avec sa douce moitié, Confusion est une des premières places qui me vient à l'esprit. Le décor, l'éclairage, les balançoires, bref, le cadre entier créé une ambiance à la fois super romantique et animée.  On a eu le droit à un service attentionné et sympa lors des deux visites; les serveurs prenaient la peine de nous expliquer la plupart des plats et de faire des recommandations.   Au cours des derniers mois, plusieurs événements promotionnels  se sont rajoutés à la scène culinaire montréalaise, comme Burger Week, Poutine Week, MTL à Table et Le Chop, et c'est bien comme ça. Ce que j'ai trouvé dommage avec MTL à Table est le grand nombre de restos, parmi la centaine présente, qui offraient des tables d'hôtes médiocres et inintéressantes, on a l'impression que certains voulaient simplement avoir leur nom affiché sur ze liste.  COOL - Ambiance romantique - Grand choix de vins - OpenTable  BOF - Prix légèrement élevés pour la portion qu'on obtient dans les mets principaux"}
{"text":"Love this Place - they score on my Atmosphere, Service, Food scale!  Atmosphere: for a place on St. Denis (know for it's clubs and sometimes ruckus crowds) Confusion is surprisingly intimate! The place is a cosy duplex building (small terras), an walking in give patrons the impression of walking into someone's house.  Indeed the various rooms at Confusion are set up in such a way so as to give dinner the distinct feeling of having dinner / taps at a friend's house.  Very very charming characteristic this!  Service: The service is extremely well polished.  The waiters and waitresses are very knowledgeable in the menu items, witch (it must be said) are anything but run-of-the-mill type of tapas.  Genial crew, and willing to engage is conversation and give advice. Top marks.  Food: Confusion's claim to fame is it's bevy of tapas and drinks.  There is something for most every one's liking on the menu: from cheeses, to tartars, foi gras and sea food dishes - the plates are well presented and the content leaving nothing to be desired.  Although the portions may seems somewhat limited, looks can be deceiving - but remember that sampling the various dishes is the goal here rather than enjoying only one. A little on the pricy side ~ but in return you will have a very good time!  Cosy and Homey ~ great for a date or a gathering of friends"}
{"text":"Celebrating my wife's bday, we decided to take a stroll thru the Latin Quarter and see what would look interesting.  We've always been a fan of tapas-style cuisine (vietnamese = do an nhau), so this seemed to be a perfect little place for food and drinks.  Upon entering, the place is decorated in a very modern, lounge-type atmosphere, which was fine with us.  It was quite busy and no avail seating; however, we offered seating at the bar, which also was fine.  Our bartender/waitress (cindy) was extremely nice and helpful, which made for a pleasant evening.  For the meals we had:  -Mushroom soup - excellent -Mini-Burger Trio - one each of Lamb, Duck, and Veg - excellent -Carpaccio Duo - Beef and Deer - excellent -Foie Gras of the Week - Walnut seared with maple syrup - a little on the salty side, so execution was not there, but idea was - good -Creme Brulee Trio - excellent.  It was just really nice to be able to sit and enjoy the drinks and a variety of foods w/o getting bloated on a big greasy plate of whatever.  We would definitely come back on our next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at Confusion. The service was great and quick, even on a Friday night w/o reservations we ate and were able to catch our 8:00 show. They sat us at the swings, and seemed to think that was a bad thing, but we didn't mind. Eating on swings=awesome!  The food was incredible, one of the best meals we've had in Montreal. Esp. fabulous was the crispy duck which is served with torillas and a maple sauce, the cognac fois gras with date bread, and the truffle oil risotto which was a special that night."}
{"text":"Had my 'special' birthday dinner with about 10 friends at Confusion.  They have a wonderful big 'banket' on the lower floor where we could all be seated and actually face each other unlike most places where large parties are seated at long tables  and you can't see or hear your entire party.  This was already a bonus even before we started eating.  Drinks were great, especially the dirty martini.  We tasted several of the different tapas and everything was delicious but what really stood out was the slider with fois gras and the tartar.....OMG!  I am not a tartar sort of person and had to be convinced to try it, but I wiped up the plate with the bread, which as also delicious. This is a very hip place...the decor, the menu and the neighborhood but very welcoming even for 'regular' folks like my friends and me.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow.  Where to start.  Pee smell in restaurent.  Pee smell in the toilets. Terribly bad service, really bad food, cold and cheap ingredients.  Not able to bring water or check if everything is fine.  I went there 2 year ago.  It was honest place.  Now, it's a dump.  They will close before this fall ... I would bet 100$ on that."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  Dim, subdued lighting and dark, plush decor give off a very intimate vibe.  Noise level is not quiet, nor is it loud enough to make an easy conversation across the table difficult, however.  Tasteful, but unremarkable lounge music piped in as background rounds out the feel.   Food:  Eclectic tapas fare that is well executed with only mild pretension (which is easily excusable).  Four dishes should serve a party of 2 very well with dessert being a tipping point between comfortably sated and 'overwhelmed'.  Wine list is better than decent with a heavy emphasis on European wines.  And a good selection of Scotches and cordials round out the meal nicely.  Service:  Generally pretty good.  Staff was attentive and polite but not intrusive.  No problems with English speaking customers at all.  The staff is also content to let parties linger to talk, drink, etc. without the usual rush to clear you out for the next customers.  It's a relaxing change of pace.  Price:  Not an inexpensive meal by any means.  Expect to spend $60 or more for two people (depending on alcohol).  However, given all the other positives of this establishment, it didn't feel overpriced but rather what one would expect for a nice meal out.  Hassle factor:  we went on a weeknight so had no problems getting in.  However, on busy nights, a reservation might be helpful, especially for parties of more than two.  Overall:  Recommended.  Excellent for couples.  Better than decent for small business dinners."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, esp. amazing steak tartare, one of the best I ever had included the many French ones!"}
{"text":"Confusion is a tapas-style restolounge (how I hated typing that), offering several varieties of small plates, as well as mains.   We shared foie gras with truffle oil (outstanding, rich, knocked us out upon returning to the hotel room), white asparagus salad (fresh, but nothing exceptional), escargot (needed a saltier note... not enough parmesan), confit quail (the accompanying cucumber salad is outstanding, the quail was moist and tasty), and saganaki (aptly made, flambe'd at the table, with kelofatiri cheese).   We ordered a cucumber soup, which did not arrive, and we had to remind our server about the foie gras to end the meal. Quickly, the soup was taken off the bill and the server apologized for the missing foie, which arrived a few minutes later. Our server was very attentive and friendly, if a tad overwhelmed by the size of the dining room.   What's preventing Confusion from really hitting a homerun is its lack of focus. It's a mishmash of culinary and interior design ideas that come across as not being exactly welcoming and frankly, a tad pretentious. A refined menu (instead of the dozens of dishes on offer) and less kitsch (really, who wants to sit on a swing in a restaurant?) is needed. Sadly, it seems as if the proprietors know about this, seeing as the place is named Confusion.   I would like to come back, but I probably won't."}
{"text":"L'endroit s'inscrit dans ma section des bonnes adresses à connaître et à avoir à l'esprit.  Côté bouffe, bonne qualité.  Les plats sont savoureux.  Grand coup de chapeau pour le service.  Attentionné et efficace.  Seul bémol, des prix passablement élevés pour la quantité.  On peut toutefois atténuer ce bémol grâce à des promotions occasionnelles sur Accès resto par exemple.  On y retourne?  Certainement."}
{"text":"Joli petit restaurant sur St-Denis Bar à Tapas Au menu, porc effiloché au foie gras et accras de morue sauce mayonnaise au cari"}
{"text":"Went there for my boyfriends birthday as a large group! It was nice we had our own spot upstairs- a lot of food but you need to like a large arrangement of different foods to enjoy this place. It was not what my taste buds like but the group in general REALLY liked it. Not a cheap place- prepare yourself for a bill."}
{"text":"Chose restaurant off accessresto.  Went at 8 pm for two. Place was empty and tons of plates and bills left over on tables. Not ready to receive additional customers.  Menu had too many items which admittedly did make it confusing. So confusing that they also offered preset dinners if you weren't sure if you wanted straight up cold or hot foie with your hummus pita chips/lobster Mac and cheese or spicy tomato soup.  Waiter not knowledgeable about menu. Would like more descriptions on menu items apart from 'spicy' or 'kick to it.'  Bar not stocked. Didn't have my whiskey. Cocktail menu was bland and uninspiring.   So we had enough red flags at that point to only order the vanilla smoked pan seared scallops (yummy on paper right?) And the beef tartare (truffles, parm, the usual...).  $18 for three marginally sized scallops drench in vanilla corn syrup. No smoke, more burnt than seared. The most insulting part is the audacity of a culinary  institution to mock their patrons by having corn syrup drizzled on the side as a garnish. You clearly do not respect your customers if you provide this quality of food. Shame on you.  Tartare needs to be fresh. No amount of fake truffle oil can cover that. Enough said.  If you have no taste buds and like blindly paying for randomly assembled foods on a plate while sitting on a swing in a cool hip dive-ish type vibe restaurant this is the place for you. Kuddos to the early millennial song list though- that was the least confusing part of this cluster mess of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Très cher pour de la nourriture qui ne goûte presque rien. Extrêmement déçu nous ne retourneront plus à ce restaurant. 100$ pour de personnes qui sont sortis en ayant encore faim c'est décevant."}
{"text":"Excellent place for tapas! The beef carpaccio and lobster mac+cheese were recommended to us and they were both delicious. My personal favorite was the lamb sliders, especially because I got to eat most of them since I was the only person who wanted lamb :) . They have a wide variety of dishes and their prices range such that you don't have to spend your entire paycheck to get some good tapas (but I recommend you splurge on at least one)"}
{"text":"Fantastic, fanciful French cuisine. Loved the foie gras and sliders. Ambience is modern with swings that serve as seats for the side tables. Service was a bit slow at first but the waiters were very friendly and charming. English was also widely spoken by most of the waiters which was convenient for us tourists."}
{"text":"The name is a bit odd, but given that they don't serve traditional tapas, it's probably fitting because when you start reading the tapas menu, and don't see the traditional spanish fare you have a confused look.  They served a variety of cuisines, but seemed to specialize in Fois Gras and Tartars.    The service was excellent.  Had no issues waiting for a table, they even made extra room for us on the patio.    To drink, we had the sangria.  Absolutely amazing.  We didn't go for the XXX version which  contained an obscene amount of alcohol, but what we had was perfect.  My wife also had the Lychee Supreme which was a sort of like a Lychee Sangria made with a Gewurztraminer wine, and I had the Caipirinha, both of which were very fresh and fantastic.    For dinner, we had the following: a. Saghanaki - Pan fried Greek cheese with flaming Ouzo.  Amazing.   b. Sweet Potato Fries with a black truffle mayo.  I loved the sweet potato fries.  Not overly greasy, and went perfectly with the mayo. c. Grilled Garlic scented Shrimp served with a watercress salad:  Amazing!  Cooked perfectly, and the watercress salad hit the spot. d. Salmon Tartar with wasabi crunch: Phenomenal. e. For desert, we had the creme-brule trio.  This was really excellent.  Three ramekins with amaretto, milk and chocolate creme brule.  My favorite was the one with the amaretto.  Not overly rich or sweet, but just had a great crust and a perfect custard.  Really great service and excellent food.  Perfect end to a fantastic day in Montreal."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, you should get some!  Really tasty roasted half chicken and arugula salad. Topped it off with the chocolate fondant which had a vary subtle but nice chili spice hint/finish. Great service too.  And the swing seats were a kick."}
{"text":"This place was magnificent. We had a party of 13 people and it was one of the best meals ever.   We chose to go with the $50 per person option. This was mid-level as far as price. You can do cheaper and more expensive.   This meal consisted of everything from soup to the most delicious pork I have ever had in my entire life right down to the best polenta I have ever eaten. For reals!   Our server was amazing. He never missed a beat. Our champagne glasses as well as our water glasses were full the entire time.  We never had to ask for a single thing. He was even more awesome because he was a Frenchman dealing with a bunch of rowdy Americans.   I have already recommended this place to my in-laws who plan on visiting the area next month."}
{"text":"Then name speaks for itself, they were very confused, the concept was exciting, however the execution was mediocre. Will never come back."}
{"text":"When visiting Montreal, each meal is an opportunity that must be taken very seriously! With so much incredible food in one city you much choose wisely when in town for a long weekend. Confusion was recommended to my boyfriend and I by a friend. It's a tapas style restaurant with a fusion take.   Although not everything we had was to my fancy, it was a memorable meal none the less. The decor really goes far in creating the atmosphere of this place with cozy tables, dim lighting, and swinging seats throughout. However we were here for the food! We weren't terribly hungry so we opted to share a couple plates. We had the scallops with came with polenta and a chimichurri sauce. It was absolutely divine. The scallops were cooked to pure perfection. To go with we also ordered the octopus. My boyfriend quite like it but I'm still on the fence when it comes to the eight legged species in general. It was well cooked  but any time I eat octopus I feel insanely guilty. I know how intelligent they are, and it makes it hard for me to enjoy eating them. Plus the salsa was too salty for my palate.   To finish we has the fondant au chocolat which left us both in a happy place. I would come here again, but with a larger group to be able to try a greater variety of dishes."}
{"text":"i was a bit confused when i saw two addresses for this location, but turns out, upstairs is the bar, downstairs is the restaurant.  you walk in and the place is dimly lit, decorated with palettes of red and black. you see swings for seats on one side of the of the wall that seem cool at first, but of course, i had to try sitting on the swings and realized the hard way that its all for show...  we arrived hungry and ordered 4 dishes, thinking we would have to order more. the hummus was surprisingly delicious, flavored to perfection with garlic and chives. the fried calamari was not so good and tasted like a bottle of salt fell into the batter. we also ordered the mini burgers which were so adorable, but tasted like any burger. we also ordered the crispy duck, which i thought was really good when eaten with celery.   my overall dining experience here was great. the service is pretty attentive and very helpful. the place is quiet enough to have a conversation with the person sitting across from you. definitely worth checking out if youre in the area."}
{"text":"This was a terrific find this past weekend in Montreal.  The arugula salad was delicious, as was the salmon tartare and seared duck appetizers. Excellent wine and a perfect martini made exactly as ordered.  Our server was very attentive and always happily smiling even though obviously busy.   It was in a fun, active part of town as well.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ooof.. Went back a few days ago and mannnn have things changed in a year!  1. The food sucks.. SUCKS. Absolutely no taste whatsoever in any of our 8 dishes including repeats from last years amazing menu except for the sweet potato fries (which require zero culinary skills to make) and the spicy lava cake for dessert. I guess they changed their chef?  2. The huge pitchers from last year are now gone. You can now be rest assured that you are paying for a typical sized pitcher so nothing special going on here anymore..  3. They didn't have the a/c on when we were there and it was super hot and humid  Totally disappointed by the changes but I guess I shouldn't have been surprised since it was empty on a Saturday night whereas all the neighboring bars/restaurants were packed.."}
{"text":"With the food being quite pricey as ranked $$$, the service was waaaay worse than foodcourt/fastfood cunters, from the moment we sat down till we walked out the door, UNBELIEVABLY BAD! Moreover, the manager doesn't even give a sh*t about the customer's complaints, forget about any compensation you'd expect.  Go if you don't expect any service while paying $40-60/person, I would never go back!"}
{"text":"C'est notre deuxième fois dans ce magnifique restaurant et je suis toujours très satisfait !   Nous avons mangé de la pieuvre, des minis hamburgers , un tartare de saumon et une crêpe au canard ! Des plats extravagants qui finissent par être un vrai régal ensemble !  Le service était parfait ( et nous étions un mardi )   Nous avons vraiment aimé !!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Went there by myself and git so much attention and great recommendations from my waiter which btw was speaking 3 languages. Food was delicious! Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FOIE GRAS HEAVEN!  This was for our #salaciouscanada tour which will be posted at tastytwosome.com shortly.  Okay. FOURRRRRRRRRRRRR dishes of foie.  FOUR.  Foie gras poached in red wine Foie gras and truffle oil (pan seared) Foie gras and mushrooms (pan seared) Foie gras and duck gizzards (pan seared)  WHAT? FOIE GRAS HEAVEN.  If you're looking to go to Montreal for foie. This is your place.  Forget au pied de cochon.  This place... THIS place is where you need to be.  Also had awesome decor and you can sit at tables with swings (uber cute), the ambience is sexy, and it's beautiful.  Great wine list, and greeeeeat menu beside the foie.  But the foie... oh the foie..."}
{"text":"We came here as the one fancy dinner for my buddy's bachelor party.  Although the food was great and the service was polite, it took forrrrrreveerr to get our food.  We were in this restaurant for about a total of 2.5 hours.  About one hour of that was waiting for the food to come out and between dishes.    I've only added pics of the dishes that I loved/remembered.  This place knows steak.  All the red meat we had was perfectly seared.  The scallops were also perfectly seared and I loved the seafood mac n cheese.  Everything else was average.    If it wasn't for the scallops, steaks and polite service, this place would only get two stars from me.    I wouldn't return, but I would recommend for groups of four or less.  Stick to the steaks, seafood mac n cheese, and the scallops.  Don't let them hold you up for two hours though.  Time is expensive when I'm on vacation."}
{"text":"Le restaurant est extrêmement bien placé, juste à côté du Cineplex Odeon du quartier latin, donc le lieu idéal après/avant une petite séance de ciné!  La décoration est très originale avec ses murs en pierres, ses canapés en velours rouge et le clou du spectacle....ses balançoires qui tiennent lieu de chaises!  Nous avons testé ce restaurant à l'occasion de l'événement Oystermania (pour les amateurs d'huîtres) et nous n'avons pas été déçus car elles étaient très goûteuses!  Cependant ce que nous avons commandé en plus  sur la carte du restaurant n'était vraiment pas intéressant...les minis burger à l'agneau ne comportait qu'une boulette de viande entre deux pains...très décevant! Il faut ajouter à cela une qualité de service plus que discutable...une attente infinie et des serveurs ayant l'air un peu perdu!  L'environnement est définitivement très agréable....mais j'ai des doutes quand à la qualité des mets servis!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great variety for vegetarians.  Espresso not so good.  Bookmarked and will be back!"}
{"text":"Never going back.. The service was extremely longggggggggg between each tapas, the salmon tartare not amazing, the beet salad was very basic and to finish the seafood mac'n'cheese was way to salty and it had only 1 medium shrimp, 2 scallops and about 4 mussels.. VERY DISAPOINTING FOR 24$. I asked if it was normal that the plate had only one shrimp they said no we're sorry and they brought me 2 little garlic shrimps. I expected more from this restaurant.."}
{"text":"Lobster Mac and Cheese was delicious, there's some calamari and other seafood included. So fresh!!!! Taste just right, not too salty.   The staff was super friendly, service was quick! Amazing food NO REGRETS!"}
{"text":"Ok, so when we came in we had a bit of discussion about whether or not to stay on account of the cheesiness.  (Morcheeba, thievery corporation and the like were playing in the background.. Plus the red mood lighting was a little much)  In the end, we figured what the hell... We were there and it was cold out... And it was worth a shot.  Drinks were good.  Food was ok, 7/10.  But dear god was it overpriced!!  We ordered the duck mini burgers, expecting at least 2 mini burgers (it's a tapas joint after all), but to our total surprise.. Only one burger.. I mean it was $12 for a SINGLE mini burger!!! (that would mean a real normal size burger of this variety would have cost $48).   Ridiculous.  Anyways.. Bill before tip was $100+ for 4 tapas (one of which was a single mini burger) and 3 drinks... Insane.  Advice: save your money and go to Voro, Pullman, Buvette Chez Simone or Trois Petite Bouchon for the same price and 3x the quality."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because our departure from this hell hole led to a fantastic evening.    My boyfriend and I came here for dinner (yes we had a reservation, although it wasn't necessary given the restaurant was almost entirely empty) and were quickly ushered to our table.   We sat at that table and waited. And waited some more. And then we --wait for it-- kept waiting; until finally my boyfriend made the executive decision to bail the fuck out of there.  We then proceeded to make our way to Au Pied de Cochon, where we caught a glimpse of Seth Rogen and had the best meal of our lives.   In a way I'd like to thank Confusion. The terrible service that prompted us to leave allowed us to have our best night in Montreal.   Thanks fuckers. Thanks a bunch."}
{"text":"Situé en face du Théâtre St-Denis, donc une belle opportunité avant un spectacle, j'y suis allée sans me faire d'attente.   Quel secret bien gardé que ce Confusion Tapas du monde.   Premièrement l'ambiance est feutrée et chaleureuse (mur en briques et peintures accrochées, etc.).  J'ai encore l'eau à la bouche ...  Le tartare de saumon, avocat, croquette de risotto et huître était sublime! (14$).  Les dattes medjool farciesau feta de brebis étaient divinement délicieuses avec le pancetta maison (9$).   Le gâteau de crabe, oignon frits aioli et coriandre était à s'en lécher les doigts!  Allez-y ça vaut le détour à 100%!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out and try the dishes. The menu looked delicious. Unfortunately, the food was very bland and left a lot to be desired. The only good dish ordered out of 6 was the sweet potato fries. Won't be coming back and do not recommend it."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful and the service cannot be beat. Our waiter was extremely helpful, and all the waiters I heard  sounded enthusiastic about the dishes they were offering.  I am accustomed to NYC tapas style prices so I didn't really have much of a sticker shock while looking at the menu. Although $29 for the lobster mac seemed very high. The couple next to us ordered it, and I was amazed to see what amounted to a half lobster  stuffed with a heaping pile of macaroni and cheese. It was a bit unsightly and you still had to pick the meat from cheese covered claws and tail, but they seemed to justify the price.   We had the Saganaki cheese, escargot, octopus, scallops and sweet potato fries which were delivered to the table in a logical progression showing that they put a lot of thought into the service.   The saganaki was fantastic (you need to ask for bread...kind of a pet peeve) as was the octopus  and sweet potato fries. The scallops were ok. They did not get much of a sear on them, and the vanilla sauce was overpowering and a bit too sweet. The escargot was probably the most disappointing dish I have ever seen. Judging from the description, it sounds like a non-traditional preparation and it most definitely was. What came out was what looked like an adult version of \"Ants on a log\" with a large grilled slice of zucchini with about 5 snails on top smothered with cheese. Underneath was a very sweet and acidic tomato chutney that really did nothing for the dish.  Overall, it was a great meal in a cute and interesting little place. From looking around, both the salmon and duck tartare looked fantastic and, in hindsight, we should have ordered that instead of the escargot. Also the pain perdu that our table-neighbors ordered looked like an incredibly delicious dessert.     I would definitely go back to try some more dishes, and it makes a great date spot. Also, the service is fantastic which is a rarity these days."}
{"text":"On y est allé pour oystermania un mardi soir. C'est sûr que le mardi soir est toujours un peu ''busy'' dans ce quartier dû à la proximité du cinéma et au mardi à moitié prix du ciné. Donc, nous savions qu'il y aurait peut être un peu plus d'attente qu'à l'habitude... Mais je dois avoué que le service a été quand même assez long, même pour avoir de l'eau ou la facture. Pour nous, ce n'était pas très grave car nous n'étions pas pressés mais si vous l'êtes, je pense qu'il faut le mentionner. Les huîtres étaient assez belles, les drinks - bloody cesar et bière - étaient bonnes et le serveur sympathique! Les frites de patates douces et les burgers étaient bons aussi, et le menu est pas mal et pas trop cher. A essayer!"}
{"text":"Samedi soir 21h, la place est bondée à 80%. On (2) attend à la porte un bon 5 minutes sans que personne nous accueille. Puisqu'il n'y aucune enseigne qui nous informe d'attendre pour être placé, on se choisi une table. Au bout d'un autre 5 minutes, un serveur nous aborde cavalièrement et insiste pour nous changer de table à l'étage supérieure. Moi et ma copine on se regarde en riant de la situation et du colon, puis on quitte la place. L'expérience fût minable."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is super efficient and friendly! So far, this is my favorite Resto in montreal! Its a little pricey but its well justified when you get the plates and taste the complexity of the dish!  The menu is very diverse. And the decor is very welcoming. For some table the chair as swings!!! So fun:)"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Service is a bit slow, as confirmed by a local who was with us. Prices were great for the amount of food we orderd.  Of course this is all based on an American reviewing who hails from the SF bay area where everything is expensive and things are always at a quick pace.   I would return with my significant other whenever I visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"On est aller pour le oystermania. C'était bon mais par contre le service était très très long"}
{"text":"What a refreshing spot on Rue St. Denis, which is overrun with chain restaurants and bars.  I loved the decoration, music and vibe of the place...and the service was top notch!!    The entire tapas menu sounds so delicious, I had wished we were with a larger group so that I could try them all!!  As it was just my husband and I, we had some serious decisions to make...I would say, my head was spinning from the choices and it put me in a state of \"confusion\"!  We went with the hummus, bacon wrapped dates, beef carpaccio, sweetbreads and sweet potato fries.  The only dish we didn't really enjoy was the hummus.  It was far too salty and that's all I could taste.  We try to steer clear of too much sodium on a regular basis, so perhaps we are overly sensitive to the taste.  Everything else was delicious.  The carpaccio had a very nice vinaigrette with capers and the dates were delectable.  My husband raved about the sweetbreads, but I was too busy shoving sweet potato fries in my mouth to take a bite of his dish.    Those.Sweet.Potato.Fries...oh.my.goodness.  These were the BEST sweets that i have ever had...and that means a lot coming from Miss \"I'll sub the regular fries for sweets, please..\".  I have no idea what they battered them in, but I'm determined to find out.  Then the truffle aioli,  had juuuuust enough truffle to not make it over powering.  I just wish I lived in Montreal so that I could eat them more often!!  There's no confusion about it, this place is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Confusion is a good name for this restaurant. You will be confused by the price. Good meal but sample size for big price. $35 for 2 tapas. I had to find an another restaurant to finish my diner. So If you are hungry, stay away"}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit. Les tapas sont tous très bons. Le must reste le cadre intimiste et ses balançoires/chaises dans la salle à manger."}
{"text":"This place is interesting. The swings and atmosphere are fun. They were playing 90's hits - which was odd for a nice, semi-romantic restaurant on a Saturday night. It was pricey, about $100 for two people.  Most of the food was good, in particular the duck and salmon tartars.  Stay far away from the popcorn shrimp. It's the same product you would get from the freezer section of a discount grocery store."}
{"text":"An intimate, trendy, below street-level restaurant. Tables closely packed together. Our server deftly went back and forth between English and French without skipping a beat. The swing tables are cool to look at, but nobody sat at them during our visit.  We chose five different tapas from the menu including: crispy duck tortillas w hoisin (yum), salmon tartare (delicious), arugula salad (very good), Carnivores humus w duck confit (not exactly what we were expecting) and the hangar steak w lentils (phenomenal).  The food and the service are truly exceptional.  My complaint is a small one.. the servers run up and down the stairs constantly, stomping the whole time.  This gets a little distracting.  Perhaps there is something that can be done about this? Maybe they need to take a few seconds to \"walk softly\", but then again who does anything quietly anymore?"}
{"text":"100$ pour 2,  5 tapas...déception total,  Festival de la panure qui goute toute la même chose Over price,aucun gout....  Salade de betterave avec fromage de chèvre pané.  Moyen Tartare de saumon, avec un poisson pané, ok Calmars avec beaucoup trop de panure non cuite et très farineuses   Crevette de matane popcorn dans beaucoup trop de panure Frite maison a 5$, petite portion et très ordinaire avec un patte de pieuvre bruler retrouver dans notre frite..."}
{"text":"There are plenty of hit or miss spots in this jumpin' area of St Denis, and Confusion starts off on the wrong foot by only opening at 5:30pm (totally unexpected on a street where the terraces are usually full of folks eating and drinking wine and sangria by noonish.) But it's got some mojo working for it - the outdoor patio is small and surrounded by a thick hedge making you feel like you're in a garden but still right in the swirl of action on the street. The indoor seating downstairs feels like a quirky, lush bistro carved into a 200 year old stone foundation. Some of the seating is booths, some is swings, which we avoided due to our pre-dinner drinks and general klutziness, but we are pro indoor swings in general. The tapas options are diverse, we enjoyed the duck rolls, chorizo, and scallops in particular. Everything was very flavourful and suited the fabulous if slightly boudoir decor. The service was friendly, funny and attentive."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere complete with swings to sit on at some of the tables.  The prices were a little high on some of the tapas, but most of them were worth it.    We ordered the homemade fries with lime and pepper mayonnaise.  The condiment had a nice kick to it, and the fries came in a cute little brown paper bag.  Next we had the raclette with chorizo served atop potatoes.  Delicious!  Then again, it's hard to mess up the simplicity that is yummy cheese and chorizo on top of sliced potatoes.    The roasted scallops with polenta and edamame were AMAZING!  The portion was very small, only 4 scallops, so you may want to order more than one if you are in a scallop loving group.    The special of the night was a small filet mignon served on top of mixed veggies.  The filet was over cooked, I don't even think we were asked how we wanted it cooked.  The mixed veggies were very tasty except for the potatoes that were still raw and hard.    My favorite dish of the night, and totally worth the price for the amount of meat you get, was the braised beef short ribs.  Cooked to falling off the bone perfection.    Great place for an intimate date."}
{"text":"Purely exceptional! Hands down my favorite place to eat during this past gay pride weekend. The food was absolutely delicious. In addition, the waitstaff was very friendly. We did the 4 person $50 special,  which was more than enough food for four hungry gay boys. When I come from from Montreal this is first on my list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Lots of small plates that were delicious. Had the beet salad with goat cheese and the salmon croquette.Fish soup with kimchi and Israeli couscous salad were also good.We shared everything and were quite satisfied.They have a nice selection of full course dinners. Nicely decorated, quiet restaurant with a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"So I really wasn't impressed for a 90$ meal. Nice little place, very cozy and great decor. It was only missing some music. It's pretty cool cause they actually have real swings. I think they were under staff cause the service was a big slow. The bathroom was mix and there was only one but it was clean.  They recommend taking 2-3 tapas Per person, I thought that the portions were really big for a tapas. First off I had the soup of the day which was cauliflower and it really wasn't good at all. It was a big bowl of soup that just fills you up. Then I had the salad with a beet dressing, nuts and feta and it was 13$. The salad was mixed with so much water it was all distilled with the dressing. It was also missing other ingredients to spice it up. Then a tried the filet mignon and I really can't say anything about it excepts that it was delicious. And I also had with that, the home style fries with pepper and lemon mayo. They were pretty good but way too greasy. I had two glasses of wine which I loved!  I do still recommend it if you wanna try a new place and don't mind the price."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Found it by accident, and took a date here. We had the tasting menu for two. It was well worth it. Started with Figs and foie gras, which I really loved, then a soup, some tempura shrimp, scallops, and salmon tartar, This all led to a boar shank, then finished off with duck tartar and a mushroom risotto. I'd go here again, even though it is a little expensive."}
{"text":"The food is incredible, the ambiance is really great too, I love the exposed rock walls and decor. It's the perfect date place! But they need to bring the CRISPY DUCK back to the menu, we've been craving it for one year :("}
{"text":"First night in Montreal, this came up as one of the finer choices. As for my experience, my server was polite and made some great recommendations since I was in it for a full three course meal. For an entrèe I ordered beef tartare - first time trying raw beef and had to savor every bite. Needless to say, it was the \"purest steak\" I have ever had. Principal was the lobster-crab-shrimp-scallop-calamari-etc. etc. mac and cheese. 'twas an unreal experience. They literally give you almost a whole lobster with claws and tail included. The presentation was a work of art and the taste, heavenly. For dessert, the mi-cuit au chocolat. Suffices to say it will win your heart. They also have a huge selection of wine and beer several of which are worth trying. Will definitely return when in Montreal."}
{"text":"This is a really exellent place for a medium-sized work party where you're on expense accounts and you want to nosh and drink all night.  Alternatey, if you on a date ... ask for the seats with the swings."}
{"text":"So good!  Great food and very friendly people.  The grilled octopus and the duck confit rock"}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of my girlfriends for a few drinks and a late snack on a Saturday night. The decor is really nice. The muted lighting is perfect for someone on a first date or those who want a more subdued and relaxed atmosphere, which is exactly what we were looking for. The host was nice and accommodating. You have your choice of seating areas, which in the summer includes the outside area, right on St-Denis street for the people watchers. We chose to sit inside on the ground floor where we planted our tired behinds in a very comfortable banquette/booth. The wall to our right was a beautiful shade of crimson red and was filled with lovely modern sketches. To our right was an unpainted brick wall lined with tables and for those with a sense of adventure instead of a stool you can try one of the swings as your seat! The music wasn't overpowering and you could still hear yourself think, which was great.   We ordered everything from capirhinas, rum and cokes, beer and cucumber martinis. The drinks were OK..wasn't crazy about the cucumber martini, just didn't work for me, so the next round I ordered a capirhinia, which wasn't bad--a capirhinia is basically a Brazilian version of a mojito, and having had capirhinias made by a native Brazilian, in other words the way it was intended to taste, this didn't measure up but it wasn't too bad. Yes, I'm a drink snob, sue me! Once you've had the real deal you can't settle for second best, your expectations have been raised! The rum and cokes were good!   The food on the other hand was great! We ordered a few tapas and shared. We had the calamari, the chorizo, the frite truffe, and the veggie mini burgers. The frites were made with sweet potato fries and were amazing! The chorizo was realy good, as were the burgers, and the calamari was tasty as well. Our waiter Guillaume was great and very patient and accommodating. I will probably go back if the opportunity comes up when I'm in town. Besides the drink issue, the overall experience was very pleasant! I can always have wine. :)"}
{"text":"A cute place to grab drinks and light bites. Looks tiny from the outside but there's plenty of seating available. There were tables with swing sets to one side which looked cool and also a little kinky ;) we decided to try it out and they were pretty comfortable. Our server was super friendly and pretty upfront about the portion sizes on all the items. Since we weren't very hungry we ordered a couple of bites. I wanted the mango salad but they had run out of it (and a few others on the menu). I finally decided on the Poutine which was a pleasant surprise - made with sweet potatoes and crispy goat cheese balls with a tamarind gravy. I wouldn't mind eating this take on Poutine again. Our drinks were also really good - light and tropical cocktails. I will be back if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant and our waiters.  We sat on the swing seats until my husband couldn't balance his drooling face with gravity, then moved to chairs at the same table.  Duck tacos were amazing, and I've never had anything like the grilled cheese risotto (two fried risotto patties acting as the bread to a goat cheese sandwich...mmmm...).  Also the best saganaki (greek flaming cheese) I've ever had, covered in uzo instead of the traditional brandy.  Om nom nom.  A few stairs to get down to the restaurant, but even as a disabled person who finds stairs difficult, totally worth every step."}
{"text":"On Saturday night, I went to have dinner at this tapas place on St. Denis, Confusion. Even though I didn't have reservations, they were able to seat me immediately. There was some confusion as the server asked, \"So is he parking the car in Quebec?\". Uh, no, I said I was alone and I'm not the kind of girl a guy would stand up. Now give me some wine.  The place was really swanky with gray brick walls, red leather couches, colorful oil paintings, and a section where the tables have swings! I loved this idea so much that Josh and I went back the next day for lunch to try it out. The food is delicious and the prices were decent for the quality of the food. I had the homemade lamb sliders that have a strawberry-cranberry ketchup. They were awesome but there was mustard on them, which was not listed on the menu, and I'm not a fan of mustard. The impact on my satisfaction was minimal, however, and the risotto was perfect: mango, red pepper, coconut milk, and jalapenos. Yum!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I am not a picky eater! You can please me with almost anything!!! For the cost per dish, you expect something great, but unfortunately it was far from it. :( We started with the salmon tartar....it was ehh, I guess ok. It came with two oysters, those were actually good. Then came the tuna, that was good. Then we waited about 20 minutes for the next dish. It was a ridiculous amount of time. Once the seafood Mac and cheese came out, it was barely warm. :( the seafood was good, but the plate overall was just whatever, nothing special. By this point we were beyond disappointed in the restaurant...and then came the rib. :| it was not good. My boyfriend and I have tried several tapas restaurants in Montreal and this was bad considering every time dishes come out from other restaurants, they're always amazing! Amazing where we typical will order a double plate. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service was terrible! And when a mouse was discovered in the restaurant, the staff seemed nonchalant about it!   My friend and I had made reservations for 9pm. We got there, were seated, and gave our orders. Another pair of customers were seated to the left of us (two young women), gave their orders, and received their orders while we were still waiting (and they had ordered the same dishes as us). When we finally got our appetizers, the two young women to the left of us noticed a mouse crawling around on the ledge right behind my friend's back! We couldn't find a waiter in sight so we could inform them, so we waited a few minutes until a waiter finally appeared. We told him about the mouse (discreetly so as not to alarm other customers) and he said he would move us (and the customers to the left of us) upstairs to another floor. (The customers to the right of us just left, saying \"If there's a rodent here, imagine what's going on in the kitchen.\")   When we were moved upstairs, the manager came to apologize to us, but that was the end of the considerateness on the restaurant's part. Again, the two young women (who arrived after us) received their orders and got through most of their meail and we were still waiting for our orders. I finally had to go downstairs to find a waiter to ask about our food. Only then, after ten minutes, did our order arrive. (We arrived and gave our initial orders around 9pm, we got our appetizers around 9.30pm, and our main dishes around 10.15pm.) Service was slow throughout. Moreover, the restaurant staff seemed fairly indifferent to the fact that a mouse had been seen in the restaurant - and even joked around that it was their resident mouse who had been around for a week or so.   The two young women (who had seen the mouse with us) asked the waiter for a discount since they had seen the mouse, and we overheard that they ultimately received a 10$ discount (which is relatively little given the total cost per person is approximately 50-60$ per person). We didn't say anything - but when we got our bill, there was no discount / compensation. We didn't ask for anything, but felt the restaurant should have shown a bit more consideration and expressed a bit more of an apology for the fact that there was a mouse in their restaurant, and the overall lacking service.   The only good thing I can say about the restaurant is that the food was fairly good - especially the duck lollipops and the foie gras. But I would not go there again - when you're spending that much time and money at a place, you should not have to wait endlessly for waiters to notice you (with mice running around behind you!)."}
{"text":"It's a nice place. The decor is really fun. Great room, perfect for groups but also for a date night out. You can sit it the swings !  The food is fun and good but a bit pricey for what it is, however they had a nice selection of wine at OK prices.  Also fun for late night snacks!"}
{"text":"Horrible service can make a dining experience shitty.  - no maitre'de downstairs in the restaurant after waiting for a few minutes - waiter didn't intro hmself and didn't come around for the first 10 minutes or so - waiter ignored us multiple times even though we were by the kitchen - wine was below average and luke warm instead of cold or chilled and the waiter said it was good when it was the worst we've ever had  - mouse and didn't even really care abt it - the place smelled  funny at first but got use to it - didn't remove plates until I said something and then gave us attitude abt it' - food: i liked their dip with naan and cheese on fire (not sure of its french name)"}
{"text":"This place could easily be missed in the buzz and bustle of Rue St Denis, but I am so grateful that my hubby and I picked it for our first dinner in Montreal. Every plate we had was fantastic. The stand-out dish was the grilled octopus. We love octopus and have ordered it in many restaurants around the world, most of which were more expensive and pretentious than this little cafe, but Confusion had the best octopus ever. Hands down. The interior is very stylish and the swing seats were tempting, but we sat outside as it was a gorgeous weather night. The music from the piano bar next door drifted over, easy to hear and enjoy but not at all impeding conversation. Service was friendly and attentive. Overall a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Holy crap. I don't think I have ever had chicken that well cooked. For a tapas restaurant, the portions are enormous (it was only two of us). Its not cheap, but well worth the money. We got the fries with the lemon mayo, the half roast chicken, the capriccio and the lamb sliders. The lamb sliders were amazing. Everything was delicious and the service was excellent. Didn't have any wine but we did get a couple of beers, and those were surprisingly cheap. They have a cute little patio outside where we sat, but the decor inside was pretty impressive as well. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Nice high end Tapas restaurant located on a busy street in Montreal. Menu is not that big given that most tapas restaurants I have been to doubles the menu Confusion carries.   What I did enjoy the most and have never had any where else before is Deer steaks. I was a little iffie about the deer but that probably turned into one of my favorite meats to have. I had the deer with a side of asparagus risotto (yummy!!!!!)   Service was good.   Atmosphere is trendy and outdoor seating is nice, although try to avoid sitting by the plants because you will be surrounded by lots of small bugs.   A bit expensive.   Last but not least the food is good and worth coming back to again."}
{"text":"Was in town, visiting for a few days. This place is small, easy to miss. The atmosphere is gorgeous, small and cozy. The food was phenomenal! By far, my number one favourite tapas place! I recommend: lamb sliders, lobster Mac n Cheese, arugula salad, prime cut steak, and dessert (forgot the name but it's like a pudding that comes with maple sauce and ice cream). Can't wait to come back to Montreal, just to eat here again! Also, staff were amazing, fun, and, being their last customers, we were treated to free shots!"}
