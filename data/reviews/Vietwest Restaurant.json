{"text":"We love this place! Small friendly family business that is clean and quick service. We eat Vietnamese food often & they have the best spicy beef satay soup in the city! Broth alone is very flavorful and it makes the soup. We stop here weekly for the soup. Kids love #38, 43 and of course the subs.  And supporting a nice family who works hard."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! Fast courteous service, clean albeit small dining area. Great for pick up, food is always ready. My wife usually gets the chicken lemongrass vermicelli which comes with spring rolls. Hmmm the spring rolls. Even my Son who is a picky 4yr old eater devours them in no time. I usually go for the beef satay Pho, which isn't the best I've had but will satisfy a craving. I do however always get a BBQ chicken thigh sub. Best I've had (until I go to thi thi this Friday I am told). I have tried all other subs and they are equally as good."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I recommend #43 or #44 satay beef on vercimilli noodles. Love the spice!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant located on 4th St., Northwest. The menu is pretty comprehensive and there's lots of variety to fit the needs of everyone in your party. The pho here is pretty good and all of the vermicelli dishes are also delicious. The restaurant itself is a bit worn but the takeout is pretty good ."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for I'd say at least 3+ years in my attempts to get the kidlets to try and like new foods.  I think we finally have success!  This time with hubs at work the kids and I scaled down and only ordered 2 dishes (#38 - grilled pork/spring rolls on vermicelli & #46 - grilled lemon grass chicken/spring rolls on vermicelli).  Well they loved it.  They love eating with their chop sticks, my daughter had seconds and my boy who is getting over a high fever even ended up eating a plateful.  We've always enjoyed the food here...not sure if it's the best Vietnamese I've ever had but no complaints, good service and good food.  We were able to order 2 dishes for less than what a large pizza would cost.  Now those are some Good Cheap Eats when you really don't want to cook and are 2 days away from Vacay time!!"}
{"text":"I popped in here on a whim. I was tired and didn't feel like cooking and have a craving for b√∫n. As I walked in they were playing Space channel, and I thought to myself \"Please don't let the food suck!\"  It didn't. Fresh, well-portioned (not falling prey to the typical Calgary-sized portions) and piping hot."}
