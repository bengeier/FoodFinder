{"text":"Great burger good place to chill for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food every time we have been there, golf or no golf, this is a great destination for a fine meal. Doesn't hurt that we can walk there for dinner."}
{"text":"Love it.....it my home away from home.....I travel to az for the weather .sports and great weather...."}
{"text":"Went there for Thanksgiving dinner.  Staff are very nice, but food was incredibly average.  Paid $150 for two brunches, 2 low price glasses of wine and tip.  I will not go back.  Probably expected too much...."}
{"text":"Ordered nachos after golf. Pretty much tortilla chips burnt with a small portion of beans and cheese. Menu said avocado sauce aka guacamole- wasn't on it.  Brought it up to server came back with it and said it it's not on it anymore. Well change the menu. Worst food ever."}
{"text":"Beautiful outside dinning area.  We went on a Sunday and they only had one server/bartender. We were warned we would have to wait to place an order.  The staff was most apologetic.  Service thus was slow with no coffee refill till we were leaving.  Eggs Benedict were good , potatoes way over cooked- not edible in my mind.  Left me with a very ho hum feeling not sure if we would ever go back"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Seating outside with the sound of waterfalls and a beautiful view of the golf course.  Service top notch along with the food. Wonderful live music by Kristy Dee.  Prime rib on Wednesday nights."}
{"text":"Had lunch on the patio with friends.  Food was ok, nothing special. Waitress took the order and when she served it, she called out who had the ...and who had the ....  This  went on till the whole table was served. I know she took the order so why didn't she know who had what?"}
{"text":"The best setting in the Valley! Overlooking the Troon Ocotillo Golf Club with water falls, lush plants, gorgeous sunsets, mountains...the patio is fantastic. Perfect for date night or a client dinner. The menu is somewhat limited,  but good and service is very friendly. One of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Starting at 6 PM, Our Party of 11 with reservations waited a half hour plus for drinks...even a glass of water and tap beer. They were out of the bottle of wine we wanted to order which was listed on the menu so we waited again. By 7pm after hunting down someone to please take our order they were out of brisket, a menu item featured that evening that was available earlier if we had not had to wait so long; everyone had to reorder. The waitstaff could not tell us what St Louis ribs were so that was a crap shoot. The food when it finally came was luke warm or cool. We stared at our dirty dishes and empty glasses forever until we begged someone to remove them. The checks came out immediately after but no offer of coffee, dessert, drinks, nada! Unreal! We came to listen to Kristy Dee sing and she and the band were great along with  The patio overlooking the golf course. If you are considering a visit to listen to music eat someplace else first and maybe even bring your own water because you may never get served something to drink. By the way, Everyone around us was equally treated..."}
{"text":"This is a slice of heaven in Chandler.  Having a Troon Golf Club in the heart of South Chandler is amazing.  The course has 27 holes...3 nines that all have plenty of water.  The layout of the course is interesting, challenging, and beautiful.  Homes, lakes, and sand traps are abundant, which makes this Golf Resort tough, yet fun.  The Clubhouse is charming, with beautiful limestone and a cedar wood ceiling.  The patio is spacious, with plenty of great food and drink.  Check out Bernard's for lunch, brunch, or dinner.  The restaurant has weekly dinner specials (try Carlo's Italian Buffet on Friday Nights), and you can always order off the menu.  Love the 19th hole Bar, too.  Great place to go, even if you're not a golfer.  Friendly service, feels like a private club (without the dues)."}
{"text":"This was such a beautiful course and you don't really think you are playing in the desert somewhere! There were definitely a lot of holes with water so make sure you bring a lot of balls!! Some were sooooo difficult like the gold course that had the river right behind the hole so if you overshot...say bye bye to your perfectly played ball.  There were a few island holes too esp on a par 3 in the white course.  The people there were sooo friendly and one of my favorite was the fruit scented ice towel the marshall comes to deliver to you!!! MMMMM...it smells soooooooo good!!  After the game...make sure you go to Bernards to have their reuben sandwich! It is sooo juicy....the beef just drips down your hand!  BTW, their chicken quesadilla is amazing too! Fried just to a perfect crisp."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio and have a long leisurely Sunday afternoon  brunch while listening to Khani Cole band. Food was great and drink specials kept bill very reasonable. Service can be slow but we always spend hours here enjoying the food and the view. Love the prime rib special on Wednesday nights."}
{"text":"FINE Dining ? that's pathetic.   Golfing at Ocotillo is A+ and my favorite course in AZ..  Played a round of golf on Wednesday and decided to invite the wife over afterwards for some great food \"Fine Dining\"... big mistale.  Now get you , happy hour prices on drinks are pretty fair... and being Wed and they advertise some prime rib, I decided to give it a shot..  My order, Prime Rib, Baked potato, Asparagus - Prime rib was over done and obviously cooked as a single order. Flavor/seasoned was weak. Honestly, the WORST I have EVER had. Baked potato was cooked decent, but the \"fixins\" butter for one was like Frozen ROCK hard butter,, dumb,, didn't even come close to melting on my potato,, grrrr,, Asparagus, was also over cooked n limp, very oily with bland flavor..   Wife had Minestrone soup,,, ehhh,   I really love Ocotillo, and put a ton of effort to make the golf trip extra special by including the wife.. Seriously would have had a better time @ Denny's..  don't get me wrong, the scenery is spectacular, water fall and river off the patio, and the atmosphere would be great.. WILL NOT BE back unless I hear they got a new chef or made some drastic changes..   Come here ONLY to Golf and have a couple Happy Hour cocktails....."}
{"text":"Ate here for restaurant week. I was concerned because I could get a reservation with no problem and when I checked out the menu for restaurant week the items were not on their regular menu. That concerned me as well. We got there and the place was pretty much empty. I was worried. We were greeted very nicely and we had a nice table by the windows (which I asked for when I made the reservation. There was enough of us so we could order one of everything on the restaurant week menu. I have to say all the food was quite good. My steak was perfect, lamb done very well, orange duck delicious, Snapper very tasty. Salads were nicely done. The only negative food wise was the soup. I had the Thai lemon grass pheasant soup. It was very under seasoned, and I could not taste any lemon grass notes in the soup. The chef needs to work on that. But everything else including the deserts had us leaving very happy. I've read a lot of bad reviews for Bernard\"s, but I'm giving it a 4. Lost one star for the soup issues."}
{"text":"2nd time there, early for happy hour and okay service, arrived at 5:30 today and we walked out after 15 minutes, no service on the patio nor the bar ( too busy gabbing with regulars). Go to d.vine........"}
{"text":"We grabbed a wonderful dinner here for a special occasion that I will be mum about.  What I will not be quiet about is how Ocotillo and Bernard's made it very special for us!    We started with Prosciutto & Fig Bruchetta...the ultimate salt and sweet combo.  The spread was delish with black figs and olive oil.  Followed the appetizer with the Pork Tenderloin and some mac and cheese.  Pork Tenderloin was cooked just how I like it, medium rare and the mac cheese baked (melts in yo mouth).  A really nice enjoyable place to enjoy dinner and a cool wait staff. Thanks Ocotillo (a spiny, scarlet-flowered desert shrub of the southwestern US sometimes planted as a hedge)!"}
