{"text":"So, before the opening of this awesome Southern Tier x Victory mash-up, I got to meet the Head brewer, some bartenders, and a sales rep from the establishment @ Harris Teeter. They were very nice, professional, and most of all, gave away free swag.   This past Sunday, 6/24/18, I went to the actual location and was treated even better by the staff. I love how spacious and open the venue is. There's plenty of seating which allows you to enjoy yourself with a large group but not be cluttered. There is 130 taps and over 40 different beers which gives one plenty of options.   The food was also surprisingly good to be a brewery. I got the citrus salmon and daily mozzarella which we both define. Not to mention, the food is fairly priced.   All in all, I would recommend this place to anyone who is in CLT or anywhere in the nation for that matter. It's definitely a sight to behold. O_o"}
{"text":"Honestly I can't find a flaw here. The beer is great, the food is great, and every person who works here has been friendly. Plenty of space, lots of parking... huge competition for other breweries!"}
{"text":"LOVE this brewery! I went last Monday after it first opened and I'm already in love! I may be a little biased because I think Victory has some of the best beer around but that aside - this place is awesome. Great, attentive servers and friendly staff in a huge open air space. My boyfriend and I each had a flight and then split one more. It was such a blast seeing the mix of people hanging out there on a Monday night. We sat inside as it was about to rain but they do have covered seating which we'll be doing next visit. I'm thinking I'm about to become a regular here!"}
{"text":"If tasty beer and a laidback atmosphere is what you're after, look no further than this new Victory-Southern Tier collaboration. 2 awesome Northeast breweries coming together and serving up really good beer - what more could you ask for?! Well, I know the restaurant is new but the wait staff certainly is confused about tables and table number and waiting 20+ minutes for a beer to be delivered was a bit absurd. Our waitress was nice and personable but the overall staff service was slow. The beers are delicious but I think flights are a bit overpriced at $12.50 for 5 samples. I am more accustomed to ~$8-10 flights in the Northeast where you expect to pay a bit more. That said, I will definitely be back to try some of the food and to have some more Mad Kings Weiss."}
{"text":"Amazing first experience! Walked in at 3p on the first Saturday since their opening. The bartender helped us right away. There was available seating outside. We put our name in to get a table and we we're called in less than ten minutes. Our food was delicious and came out so quickly. Our server, Andrew, was fantastic. Give that man a raise. Have I mentioned how good the beer is?"}
{"text":"This place is huge and it was packed.  And I know why.. Good beer and good food. Favorite beers: Samoa and V12. We also had their smoked wings and fries loaded with jalapeno gravy and bacon...yum!!! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is huge!! I love all the small intimate breweries in Charlotte, but the problem is that they are always so crowded. This place doesn't have that problem with over 270 indoor seats at at just as many outdoor seats. There's a variety of options too: bar seats, high tops, lounge areas with couches, and regular dining-style tables. We came on opening day at dinner time and didn't have any issue getting a spot. Also, the space is beautifully designed and has a nice open feel.  The beer list is of course excellent... I wouldn't expect anything else from these brewers. I had the Kirsch Gose, a sour cherry beer, by Victory and I liked it well enough. My friend also ordered their in-house root beer, which was very yummy. They had over 30 beer options and will also be adding a liquor/cocktail menu at some point!  The food was really good, especially considering it was opening day! The menu is generally bar food, but it's a little fancier. We started with the Crispy Potato Stack (with bacon cream, scallions and beer cheese) and there were 4 stacks of potato for 4 people so it was a nice snack. We then added an order of wings with the sauces on the side. They came 3 sauces, so you're bound to like one of them. For my meal, I ordered the Summer Love Poached Shrimp Roll, which is kinda like a lobster roll, but with shrimp. It came on a big hoagie roll and was a ton of food. Very yummy. I also got it with the fries. My fries were good, although a little over salted. My husbands fries however tasted a little more stale... they must've been a different batch.   Overall though, great space, great menu, and great location. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Southern Tier and Victory breweries are now owned by the same company which happens to be based in Charlotte. So it makes sense for a brewery here. I can't say that I get the name of he place but the beer is what is important. There are signs for both breweries on the exterior of the building.  Inside is a large space. There is a large L shaped bar with I'd say seating for 40 or 50 people. There are tables of various sizes around the room. There are 3 patios.   Right now the beer selections are regular selections from both breweries which is currently being shipped in but the goal is to brew beers specific to Charlotte here in their 25 barrel brew house.   While here I had a flight of beers from both breweries. My favorite of the night was Southern Tier's Samoa This which was a takeoff on a Girl Scout Samoan cookie. Quite tasty if you ask me.  What stands out here is the staff. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. It made sitting next to the obnoxious people more bearable.   They also have a food menu. I had the fries and gravy which were quite good. The fries were crispy and the gravy was made with jalape√±os so it had a nice kick to it.  I expect this place to be constantly busy which will probably keep me away on weekends. But I expect them to do well here."}
{"text":"The summer love poached shrimp roll would've had Olivia Newton John singing and the beer was amazing...... Tell me more, tell me more!"}
{"text":"The space and atmosphere are absolutely amazing. When we got a table, the service was good, too. The bars were a little crowded (to be expected) but they had beers on their menu that they didn't have in yet (looking at you, Peach Gose), which was a bummer. Will definitely be back! Fantastic addition to the CLT brewery scene!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have their own mini-store where you can purchase their products and build your own 6 pack for $12. Their food is great. Corn hole outside, dogs are welcome. Really a great environment. Everyone is SO friendly, and things moved very smoothly for being that they just opened. Very impressed."}
{"text":"\"Two Heads are Better than One\" could not be a better motto for this beautiful artisanal  brewing collaboration between Southern Tier and Victory Brewing Co!  We have been salivating for over a year now waiting for his place to open and could not be more excited! Both of these breweries are in our list of top three favorite breweries!  I am going to put out a caveat that I really wanted to give them 5 stars and I'm sure they will eventually get there but I'm going to start out with 4 stars.   Upon walking into the main door, you're greeted by a large open tap room with a variety of different seating options from restaurant tables to pub counter height tables and lounging couch nooks. They have three large bars all with numerous Southern Tier and Victory beers on tap; they probably have close to 40 different beers on tap. They also have a large outdoor patio space both covered and uncovered with tons of large screen TVs.   Their restaurant has a nice size menu all with made-fresh in the spot options with over 90% of items highlighting one of their beers as a key ingredient!  The only reasons why I am giving 4 stars is because they are going to have to work on their parking availability- we spent over 20 minutes just trying to find a parking space even with driving over onto the next road by Sugar Creek. The other reason is that it's still obvious that their servers are still getting into their groove and learning the ins and outs of service and their menu; after ordering my food it took a few minutes to get a set of silverware after it was brought to my table.   But like I said, I know we will become a regular of this place and fully expect to edit my review to 5 stars! This place is definitely a MUST-try for the Charlotte beer scene!"}
