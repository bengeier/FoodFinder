{"text":"I didn't know that this place had just moved into their new location until I got here; apparently the day I dropped by was their first day open!  FYI, the milk tea here is only $2.50! That's such a good deal compared to some places, and you get a big mug of it! Plus, if you consider yourself a tea connoisseur, the tea here is actually really strong and flavourful, instead of being watered down. It came unsweetened though, so if you want sugar, you'll probably have to ask.  They also have food if you get hungry!  I had a really good first impression of this place. It looks really nice inside and their giant front windows let in a lot of light. It's a great place to study/work while being in an open space. The seating forces you to sit near or with others, which I like because it gives it a more friendly atmosphere. The chairs are actual blocks of wood and pretty comfortable.  The workers here are all really nice! It was raining the day I came in, and one of the workers (Marian) was constantly mopping and sweeping the floors to keep it clean. When I came in, she smiled and welcomed me. I've never met workers this genuinely nice and who cared so much about their customers. The owner (I think), Phillip, came over to talk and introduce himself. It was a nice gesture! I left feeling pretty great.  I think I may have found my new favourite place to come and study! 10/10 would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday early evening wanting to try this place since it was on College street but haven't gotten a chance to until now. They close at 7 pm on Sundays fyi. I loved the wooden communal tables and chairs made of square wooden tree blocks of various colours and height. When you walk in you get a smell of herbs and tea. We ordered the Yin Yang (milk tea + coffee) and the honey milk tea with ginger. Both drinks were light and delicious and not sweet which I like, some of you would probably want to add some sugar if you like things sweet. The owner made sure to double check our order to make sure they dont make a mistake which I appreciate rather than get the wrong dish altogether. I was surprised to see that he also cooks the dishes as well. I like that they have a small menu 3 rice dishes and 4 noodle dishes and all made with some sort of tea. My bf ordered the homemade bbq pork with veggies and multigrain tea rice and I got the homemade bbq pork with veggies and green tea noodles. The dishes came out after about 10 minutes to prepare and drinks came out right away. The bbq pork was very good and balanced out together with the rice and veggies. The tomato sauce with the green tea noodles was light tasting yet very rich in flavour. I felt very healthy and light eating the noodle dish and I tasted the tea in the noodles. We also ordered the black sesame balls in milk tea to end our meal even though I was very full,  and that was great as well not too sweet the tea balanced out the sweetness from the sesame balls. Service was pleasant and quick, drink and food was great as well as the price and portion size. I definetely would recommend this place both my bf and I really enjoyed it here."}
{"text":"This place makes me really nostalgic for food in Hong Kong, as waves of fragrant home cooking vapors emanate from the open kitchen periodically when i was sitting there. They sell Hong Kong style milk tea and ginger tea. If you are a lover of five spice, pork belly, soy sauce drumsticks or want to expand your palate on Chinese tea, this place is a necessary visit.  (Because green tea and white tea isn't just from Japan... duh!) the owner believes in the medicinal purposes of nutrition and will explain the tea to you in detail. So the food is from the sixties, but the Space has a contemporary twist with the natural decor and it seems to be a huge hit with academics. Its good for coworking, studying and lunching. I'm so glad there's places catering to GROWN UP CHINESE TEA without fillers and flavors, so this is a welcome addition to the Spadina strip. The owner really cares about the quality of the product and the food, which is super rare these days. I hope more people know about it."}
{"text":"My husband brought me to this place and told me he loved how the milk tea was flavourful yet light. As a milk tea fanatic, I was so excited to check it out. This place is amazing because of its owner. The man is so down to earth and genuinely wants to give you the best experience he can. He gave me a thorough run through of the different types of teas, and gave me a taste test for all of them. He even guessed which one was my favourite. He is also a huge advocate for the extensive health benefits Chinese tea brings to the body. I got a pu-erh milk tea - 16 Oz in a beer mug for only $4! It was a tasty and educational experience. Please do check it out! Absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Great tea hosted by a very knowledgeable and passionate host. Come here for pints of pu-erh and interesting coffee-tea blends!"}
{"text":"The yinyang coffees is awesome. The boss is quite friendly. Great place to sit down and study for students."}
{"text":"You can just tell when someone opens a small business and cares deeply about quality and the customer experience. The owner of this place is one of those people. Decor is beautiful, the food is lovely, and the tea is brewed in the traditional gong fu method in clay pots, what more is there to say?"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite place of all time to have tea, coffee or a bite to eat. The ambiance is amazing, the owner is a stellar human being and the customers are a nice loyal bunch as well!"}
{"text":"Crimson is the BEST hidden gem in plain sight. The owner Philip is great, the decor is solid, and the offerings of both healthy drinks and food is so legit. Must try."}
{"text":"Wonderful tea and the people really know tea - what more can I say?"}
{"text":"I've dropped by here for snacks, teas, and meals a few times now. Personal favourite is their milk tea - it's super simple and so worth the price. It's simple and it's a classic especially since they use evaporated milk.  Their food choices can be a hit or miss. I've found their full meals of rice or noodles to be wonderful. Even as takeout, their rice meals come in relatively large portions and are well balanced meals. The one thing I would avoid on their menu is their dimsum platter which was a definite disappointment. It tasted like the frozen packets of dimsum, lots of salt and pepper added masking any other taste.  Their service is amazing though and the owner is incredibly nice and helpful with explaining the menu and walking through different options. While there is free wifi, there aren't too many outlets for working for extended periods of time."}
{"text":"The milk tea is the best in town if you are looking for a healthy option! Less than 3 dollar for a really big cup of milk tea and no taste of any artificial stuffs added! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The owner is very passionate about his tea! Milk Tea sample tastes very good. Students get 18% discount!"}
{"text":"Have been there a few times. Very nice and efficient services. They also offer 20% off discount for students. Most importantly, the owner is definitely a master of teas!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto when I stopped by this Tea restaurant. The owner is very passionate of his work; he opened this tea shop in hope that his tea, imported from Asia, would help improve people with kidney problems. He also went out of his way to make me feel very welcome in his restaurant.   In regards to the tea, I ordered the milk tea and it's a little different from what I'm used to, but in a good way. It tastes authentic compared to what I usually get in the US.  I also ordered the BBQ Pork & Vegetable and it straight up tastes like home cooking. Maybe my parents cook the same way but it made me feel like something my mom used to pack for lunch.  The restaurant itself has a good blend of modern and natural decor, with tasteful artworks hung on the wall. It was also very clean.   Overall I would definitely recommend people to check this place out."}
{"text":"I dropped by Crimson, on my visit to Toronto. The owner was very nice gave me a sample of the tea, I happily picked the one I liked. I stayed there for 2 hours and used the washroom 3 times. When leaving asked for a glass of water, the owner was irrate, saying \"its too much\" and told me not to come here anymore, telling me it s my last time. However, there was another server who gave me water, and while leaving he ran to me outside shouting \"Never come back, saying I used to the washroom too much\", I had never faced this in all my life anywhere in the world. I expect a solid apology from the owner for thos harassment of a paying visiting customer. It  is utterly disgusting."}
{"text":"a lovely surprise. Walking down Spadina we didn't expect to find such a great restaurant. Will be returning regularly. Also great place for a working lunch."}
{"text":"Just wow! The BF and I had wanted to come here for a while and finally got a chance to drop by on a weekday.   When we entered, we were the only one there. We were greeted with a warm welcome and was walked through the entire menu! We were also offered a sample to try their milk tea and ying yang. Both DELICIOUS. The milk tea is not the typical type you get from BBT places; this is legit HK style milk tea and it's is only $2.50!! What?! For such a huge size I still can't believe it.  In the end my BF got the Red Pu-erh tea while I got the Milk tea with honey ginger ($5). I fell completely in love with my drink. I'm a big fan of ginger teas and milk teas separately and this drink was literally the best combination I've ever had!!  My BF also got a BBQ pork tea rice which was quite filling, I stole a bite and it was pretty yummy! I got the sesame balls (tong yuen) in milk tea! SO yummy!!  The place had a sort of hipster feel with a beautiful long communal table in the middle. The seats were cute little tree stumps. There are also a few extra tables around.  During my stay there, I watched the host make each of our teas and other customers' teas with such care! I really appreciate seeing someone care so much about serving the best tea :)  Overall, I will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for tea lovers. The owner is very helpful and passionate about his work. The milk tea here is wonderful, strong thick tea with smooth condensed milk, and not overly sweet. They also have a variety of teas you can get without milk, which is what I love most about this place. There are tons of bubble tea places in Toronto, but a good place with real tea is hard to find. It's a great place to hang out with friends or study/work by yourself."}
{"text":"I didn't intend to visit but looking in could not help noticing the gallery like decor. So glad i went in. Amazing Chinese art on walls. And the long dining table looks like life edge art. And those amazing wooden block stools are worth the visit. Wish i could buy one to bring home.  It was past 6pm and even though the owner let me sample the milk tea, i could only have few sips due to caffeine sensitivity.  I'd like to return to sample more teas but on a day when i wont have problems with getting up next day for work. I did order the mixed mushroom tofu stir fry to go and was very pleased with the quality of the ingredients and the flavours of the meal. The owner chatted with me. He is extremely passionate about his teas and their healing and therapeutic properties. Overall a very very pleasant, happy and uplifting visit to a very lovely tea and food estsblishment."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite tea cafes. The owner is extremely kind and hospitable. He's also very knowledgeable about different kinds of tea, namely pu-erh. In your first visit, he will give you a mini tea consultation and walk you through different kinds of tea to sample, as well as check your pulse and tongue to see what kind of problems you may have and what kind of tea may be best suited to your needs. Everyone here seems to be very happy. I often come here to study and always order their milk tea with ginger honey.  To the comment that said the owner was rude because he asked the commenter to leave if they weren't ordering anything, this isn't a library. The commenter said herself that she got carried away with her project discussion and forgot to order. It isn't the owner's fault since other customers who ordered something may want to use the tables. The owner has to run a business. And no I'm not affiliated with the owner or Crimson Teas in any way, I'm just trying to be fair. The customer is not always right."}
{"text":"Excellent service. High quality and exclusive tea. The owner is awesome and the green tea noodles are bomb!"}
{"text":"This is the most unique tea shop I have visited! I love the decor and the service is simply amazing. I recommend the milk tea! I've already picked the next tea I want to try :) Will be back~"}
