{"text":"Best sub shop in town. I was it was closer to my house. I've never been disappointed when eating here. And bc of Lenny's I will never eat subway again lol"}
{"text":"Always looking for a good sub place.  The multi grain roll with my turkey was good.  Good amount of turkey with lettuce and tomato.  My husband ordered the steak and cheese which he also enjoyed.  I like the fact that they use fresh meat.  They slice per order."}
{"text":"Twice I have left Lenny's completely pissed. The service is terrible. No one cared either time that I was in the store. They waited 30 minutes until I paid for my call in to go order to even start making it. When I asked for a manager I was told to come back in 5 days when he got back. Unbelievably unprofessional. The chain down the road can make a comparable product in 30 seconds. If you want to wait all day and be treated like crap for a so so sandwich go for it."}
{"text":"The relish is addictive. Oh my effin' heaven - I can't stop thinking about it. 

Yeh, it's that good. Not terribly long ago, I was out of town and took a nap on my way home - and had a dream about Lenny's  hot pepper relish sauce. I'm not even kidding - it's that good. Additionally, their \"regular\" is the same as another chain's \"large\" - so you get incredible value for what you are spending. It might be a $10 sub, but it's worth every penny. 

Yeh. I'll take the 20 minute drive to get a Lenny's sub. Yum!"}
{"text":"Wow... Ziggy was amazing!!! Had a complex order and I made up silly names for each of my coworker's and he was such a champ.  He even carried the food to the car. Customer service was superb and food was good too! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome deli subs, and very speedy.  Make sure you are hungry if you are going to get a large or expect to have another meal out of it later."}
{"text":"This is my new go to sub shop.  The location is clean and bright and it's in a really good location.  In my opinion Lenny's has better subs than all of the other chains, one of the most important things that I have to mention is the meat and toppings that you're given.  When you order a sub for Lenny's prepare to be dazzled as they begin to freshly slice large quantities of meat and cheese for you.

You'll be given a huge amount of meat on your sub and the meat and cheese are of good quality and are fresh.  The bread also appears to be freshly baked and makes for a really nice sub.  I've never been able to eat one sub in a single sitting since they're so big.

If you're a fan of meat and cheese, I recommend that you give Lenny's a try."}
{"text":"Terribly expensive for a sandwich you could have at another restaurant with better atmosphere. Just an expensive Subway.  Shocking that they are still in business with the better options out there."}
{"text":"the bread was hard, the doritos where outdated by a year, and they got my order wrong. very disappointing will be eating at jersey mikes for now on."}
{"text":"Not really anything special, service was terrible, order was wrong and staff was not helpful at all."}
{"text":"I really like their tuna salad sandwich. The bread is good and the portions are large. Eat in or take out."}
{"text":"Last 3 times there the service was terrible.  Young kids either goofing off or on phone texting.. when you walk up to counter  thry sigh or roll their eyes... like omg i have to actually do something now...they can't get an order right.  I have to go in and personally give them my order because they for some reason dont read the entire order fron online ordering..even then it's hit and miss. The last time I was there I ordered an Italian which I always do.  It was the most god awful fattiest ham I ever had from any deli or subshop.  Big turnoff.  My dog wouldn't even eat it. It was gross.   Between the ham and the terrible service you have just lost a good customer.. improve management and quality of the meats and maybe I will come back.. doubtful though!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! I always get the Hot Italian and it's my favorite sub around. The ingredients are fresh and flavors are delish!"}
{"text":"I always get tbe philly with pepper relish,  really good! This location overall has a friendly staff,  last two times I went sandwhich maker was great and cashier couldnt even smile. Maybe a bad day, you have the option to make any sub the \"lennys way\" which is oil, vinegar, mayo, salt, pepper, lettuce, &  tomato. 
I called last night (Saturday 4-26-14)  wanted my favorite philly! But they lost my business due to having no sub rolls!??  I had to call jersey mikes instead..."}
{"text":"I love this place! I miss it too! I actually had to ask them to put half the meat on my sandwich than normal. I always go Turkey, hold the cheese, Xtra Lettuce and Banana Peppers - they make it just so how I love it!"}
{"text":"I think I just discovered the best Italian sub sandwich shop in Charlotte.  Hello capicola!  Ham is one of my favorite things in the world and they pile it high here.  It's a step up from Subway but not as expensive as Jimmy John's.  They even have their own brand of chips!  Clean restaurant, nice bathrooms. 

Closed on Sundays! - I'm getting used to it if I'm shilling out five stars anyway but I'm sticking to my guns because they're worth it."}
{"text":"First time in. Absolutely delicious. Fresh as heck. Had the #2 spicy Italian.  Such a nice change from boring ole subway. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Yum. This place is awesome. Go Tuesdays for their 2 can dine for 11.99 special. Two subs, 2 drinks, and 2 bags of chips. The cold subs are ready fast. The hot subs take a while but are worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went to Lenny's for lunch in search of something light but satisfying.  I ordered a turkey and provolone sub.  Their sandwiches taste identical to ones you could make at your home, but with a much higher markup.  In my opinion, Harris Teeter's sub sandwiches, though still not the best, are bigger, better and cheaper.

Their \"assembly line\", if you will, is very inefficient.  Whether busy or slow, the line at Lenny's only moves as fast as the slicer (a person, not an automated machine) can slice.

Though I didn't try their chips, my coworker complained that their cheddar and sour cream chips were far too salty.

At over $6 for nothing but a half sub, Lenny's provided me with a filling, underwhelming sandwich that I wasn't necessarily displeased with."}
{"text":"Lenny's is turning into my \"go-to\" sub shop - just overall good stuff, the guys running the shop are funny and seem to be happy to be making sammiches - they might be mentally ill in that regard.  

It's a sub shop - no sub shop gets a perfect score.  But Jarod better take his skinny arse to Lenny's for a real sammich!"}
{"text":"Ordered a buffalo chicken philly to go. Got back to work, no buffalo. The maker of the sandwich did however added what seemed like an entire jar of mayo to my sub which made it inedible. Plus note cashier was friendly which is the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars and not 1."}
{"text":"One of the first sub shops I visited since moving to Charlotte. Food was great, and the prices were decent, actually got a free cookie. That was CLUTCH lol."}
{"text":"I have been there twice since i have moved to the area,  and the subs are great,  there isnt a comparison between lennys subs and Subway....  The people are friendly,  The only thing that i thought was a little too much was the music was a little loud...  but other then that,  its a sub shop that will be hard too beat!"}
{"text":"The employees were no where to be found when I entered the establishment. I wanted a lemonade but the machine was filthy and had not been cleaned out from the night before."}
{"text":"Ok ok I said I would give Lenny's another try and I did, boy oh boy I'm sure glad I did! I got the turkey sub with pepper jack, tomato, onion, lettuce and mayo and it made me a believer again! The sub was loaded with toppings and the meat was freshly sliced instead of those other sub chains that keep their meat out all day. Sick!  Also, the bread was fresh and soft. I recommend the whole grain :-)


---previous review---
I finally tried this place after talking about going to it for the past year. I got coupons in the mail so it was a sign I had to try it. I got the buffalo chicken sub and my husband got the Italian-both on wheat. I enjoyed my sub, but didn't care for the buffalo sauce and I typically LOVE anything buffalo. It was more of a hot sauce oil and was super messy. I was a little let down. My husband's sub was great though! The bread was soft and didn't overpower the subs' flavor. 
Although I didn't care for my sub, I would like to come here again and try something different instead."}
{"text":"I work near this location and was looking for something other than a fried lunch. I have been there a few times. The food is always pretty good. But really the food is only about 30% of the equation. The staff there is odd. There seems to be no leadership or manager in the place. There are a few \"toxic\" employees with a few very kind employees who get run over and abused openly by the \"toxic\" ones. The nice employees get yelled at in the open and harassed in the open but the toxic staff. While the toxic staff are standing around doing nothing and clearly only have the intelligence to handle one tasks, they yell and bark orders to the other people in the room and then argue with them. Sad the owner is clueless to this behavior.

This past week I had ordered the meatball sub. While the toxic employee ignored me while standing 2 feet from me, and doing absolutely nothing, one of the other employees had to go around her to take my order.  Then when my order was completed and in the window from the back the toxic employee just yelled at the cashier that the order was up and she needed to get it. Of course the cashier was helping 2 other people and bagging an order while the toxic employee stood there and did nothing. Seems to be someone needs to be fired. If it were my place I would have fired her on the spot for that little bit of drama. 

The ordering system is a bit odd and should be fixes as well. I will give it another try as it's better than Subway and I am willing to overlook this but will point it out if needed.

This is not the first time it's happen, just about every time I go in there something is going on that is confusing and unprofessinal."}
{"text":"Stopped in one day to try this place, yawning...  Not that the sandwich was bad,  but there was nothing special about it.  I actually wished I  had just went to subway in Walmart for a sandwich,  or perhaps my palate is just accustomed to subway"}
{"text":"Good bread. Great flavors, just expensive for what it is. Chips are decent. And people....they have Pibb! 
I've gotten the turkey and provolone sandwich before and it was pretty good. Good amount of meat/toppings. 
Today however I got the Philly cheesesteak. The flavor was great, on the parts I could taste. There was such a small amount of chicken, and for 8 bucks with a combo-I was not a happy camper. 
See posted pics."}
{"text":"We found this spot and are huge, HUGE fans of the fresh vegetables and very friendly associates. They always know what I want and the Cheddar Sour Cream Chips are EVERYTHING!!!"}
{"text":"I love Lenny's!  My old office was down the street so they pretty much know me by name there and already know what I want!  What I like most about Lenny's is that they cut the meat fresh right in front of you.  They have pretty good bread and don't forget the hot pepper relish sauce on top....mmmm.  I'm definitely a condiments girl and they know to hook me up with everything except the olives-gross.  The people that work there are really nice and seem like they are having a good time, unlike the people at subway that look like they would rather kill you than make your sub."}
{"text":"I tried Lenny's for the first time today thanks to a lunchtime sub craving. I'd never heard of Lenny's until I checked yelp for nearby sandwich shops and figured it was as good as time as any to get acquainted.

It's a small-ish sub shop that's really a bootleg Jersey Mike's. You give your order at the first end, you get a receipt and then you go to the other end to pay for it and wait for your order to come out. 

There's no watching of your sandwich being made, you just have to make sure you remember to give all of the ingredients at the time of ordering. They have all of your typical sub toppings and soda/sweet tea machine. Although the beverage section was a little messy. They have indoor and outdoor eating areas and even bring out your sub if you decide to eat there. Like Jersey Mike's, they slice the meat once your sub is being prepared but Jersey Mike's provides more slices of meat.

Good, decent spot to grab a sub. Thanks to the proximity to my job, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Only have had a couple subs not bad so far would recommend the cold subs and the meatball sub"}
{"text":"If a business will cheat a customer by not honoring a Groupon (for face value only,)  he is deserving of nothing but public disdain, not patronage! A young  man who identified himself as the Lenny's Tyron owner today refused to honor my Groupon (despite Groupon policy that a business always redeems at purchase value) because he \"just bought this franchise June 1.\" *So how is  it customers' fault he didn't do due diligence to find out what outstanding obligations he was assuming??*

 This person hadn't even the grace or courtesy to offer as much as small discount, a free beverage or any other accommodation for inconvenience --just refusal-- and actually sneeringly asked me if I was \"done\" with my complaint in a very surly manner. He kept shifting his eyes leftward the entire time  as he talked instead of looking me in the eyes (look up what THAT means!) I wouldn't buy anything from such a rude individual and poor business person.

BTW, this location has no nearby disabled parking and no entrance reachable without steps-- is that even legal these days? AVOID THIS PLACE-- no offering is worth being cheated and disrespected by this very immature young man!"}
{"text":"This location specifically made me a fan of Lenny's.  I'd often stop in here before grocery shopping across the plaza to quench the munchies, shopping with the munchies is never a good idea.
Service is always prompt, while still being very personable. I got into several interesting conversations the employees. Always love random conversation. 
The meat is sliced to order. (not sitting between paper, pre-sliced, a la other sandwich shops) Bread is baked fresh. Couldn't ask for more from a sandwich shop, other than slightly lower prices. But then again, if prices get cut quality often gets cut along with it. I'll take a good cold cut sandwich any day when I can watch my meat get sliced and make a new friend."}
{"text":"PHILLY. CHEESE. STEAK.

Nice, safe, upscale location. 
Clean restaurant. 
Outside dining area on the patio. 
Great tasting subs and cheesesteaks.
Some good employees and some bad, same as everywhere else. 

This used to be my \"go to\" lunch time destination sandwich shop - even though it took me a good fifteen minutes of my lunch hour to get there. 

It was worth the effort. 

The sandwiches and subs were excellent.

Lenny's is better than Jersey Mike's, or any other sandwich chain restaurant, IMHO.

I wish they had a franchise location in Hickory."}
{"text":"I really love the subs here, the Italian the buffalo chicken philly are my favorites. The ingredients are always fresh and they slice the meat right before they make the sandwich. Sometimes they skimp on the portions for the buffalo chicken philly, it just depends who is making it. The prices are pretty decent especially for what you get. The service is alright and overall staff is friendly and efficient, again it depends on who you have serving you that day. But I've never had a bad experience and they food is definitely good enough to keep me coming back. Much better than subway."}
{"text":"I love Lenny's sub shop but I ordered the philly cheesesteak and holy cow my sandwich tasted as if had been soaking in salt the only thing edible was the bread.  Wish I would have dined in I probably would have thrown my sandwich to the cook.  I had to throw it away and just did a complaint online. This is the first down fall I've had with Lenny's Sub"}
{"text":"The food was fine and the service is friendly, if not the most efficient. Not a place I would go out of my way for a return visit, but wouldn't rule it out if someone else suggested it."}
{"text":"Being that I was born and raised in Philadelphia I'm always very critical of places that have \"Philly\" cheesesteaks and hoagies on their menu. So far I've had the turkey sub and both the chicken and beef \"Philly\" cheesesteak. None of them taste like an authentic sandwich from Philly but they are very good. I was going to give 4 stars for taste but I took away a star because when I order a 15\" sandwich, don't give me two 7\" sandwiches. And yes, I pulled out the tape measure and double checked because I'm very particular and anal, lol. Just being honest. With that being said, since the food is good and ingredients fresh I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I like the setup, online ordering, hit and some cold subs. Never had a Salad nor the hotdog here. 

Service can be lazy after 8p or 30m before closing. 

Currently they have a loyalty rewards program. Buy 8 get 1 free. Use the card or enter your number for loyalty program.  

Soda fountain and lemonade available. 

The foil wrapping  keeps the sub warm for at least 2 hours. I didn't say hot... I'm saying warm. 

They offer A1, peppers, spicy mustard and regular mustard via packs on the side if you grab and go. 

Meat for deli subs are sliced fresh in your face.  

Mushrooms cost extra. Grilled or raw. 

White or wheat bun. Flats available. 
Call in, order online or drop by in person. 2 entries to the shopping center.  

Barbershop next door. 
Seating inside is plentiful with tvs. Better than your normal sub shop. 

I'd recommend: meatball,Philly and make sure to ask for onions and peppers. Chicken philly. The Deluxe and I haven't tried the hot sauce/wing sauce óptions. 

The bacon is okay. Could be cooked harder for me."}
{"text":"If you're looking to get a sub sandwich & you're thinking of going to Subway, give this place a shot instead. While it may be a franchised place, when this Lenny's Sub Shop opened it was the 1st time I'd ever heard of the place, & it blew Subway out of the water.

The subs are not only much larger, they're also much tastier. You get your choice of sub options & can add several different options to these selections, much like a Subway. But everything just seemed much fresher than a sub from Subway. 

The inside of the place is also much more inviting than Subway, where I usually get the feeling they want me to take my sub home & eat it. Lenny's has a good amount of inside seating, with a couple of tvs to liven up the place. The patio area is also nice with some umbrella covered tables. 

So Lenny's may be a franchise sub shop just like Subway, but I'd suggest this place over Subway any day. Their prices may be a little more expensive, but you're getting a fresher, better tasting sandwich."}
{"text":"Really tired of ordering on line only to get less than would be given to me if I were eating in. Third time I've ordered the garden veggie sub and received what appears to be a sub with \"toppings\" from a meat sub versus an equivalent amount of veggies instead of meat. And not even with the standard toppings advertised- no red peppers or Swiss all three times. Really ridiculous to get add things like banana peppers and to get about 4 on a 15 inch sub. Thinking it might be better to order a meat sub with all the toppings and remove the meat. Sad."}
{"text":"I only ever get the Philly steak sub.  I don't go here often enough to sample around.  It isn't that don't like going here but I moved a few more blocks away and this isn't a destination level establishment.  I do make at least one trip there every year because I get my hankering.

Anyone want to PM me a better place to get a Philly I would appreciate it, although I guess it won't make me thinner."}
{"text":"Lenny's has many things going for it. I love the order ahead function and the rewards program (free sub after every 9 purchases plus a free one on your birthday!). The sandwiches are great - stuffed full of fresh veggies and they don't skimp on the meat. 

The staff is usually friendly but lacking in attention to detail. The chicken philly, my usual order, has come out as a traditional cheesesteak twice. Once I got back to my desk with a completely soggy bread roll - yuck!  When I have ordered cold subs the toppings have been a little hit or miss as to what actually makes it to my sandwich. 

The store is kept clean and I haven't had any issue getting out in a timely manner. When the order is correct the sandwiches are pretty tasty and filling. I would recommend trying this place out but be wary of placing a to go order without double checking first."}
{"text":"I have only been to this place twice. All I can say, is that they service the best black bean burger I have ever tasted. If the rest of the sandwiches are even close to the burger, we are all in a good place."}
{"text":"This place is trying really hard to be a cross between Jersey Mike's and Jimmy John's, but needs to work on the \"FAST\" part of their slogan.  Still better than Subway!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight around 7 pm and had excellent service! I honestly felt spoiled. The gentleman at the counter was so friendly and his manners were on point. We got our food fast and watched the olympics on tv. Our food was brought to the table and it was so delicious. I love their tomatoes-chopped perfectly and not soggy! I got the buffalo chicken sub and it was cheesy with onions and had a great kick to it. When we got done the same gentleman and possibly the owner/manager who was grilling in the back both told us to have a good night and thanked us for coming. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to the Charlotte area and have been trying places out in NC based on my coworkers' reccomendations. This place was a big win.

I had the Chicken Philly Cheese steak. Regular. Chicken was a tad questionable, but I understand why it was cut the way it was cut. Also, the bread and everything was extremely fresh. Their red pepper chili sauce is fantastic. It was a great experience and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered online and picked up in store which was quick and efficient. The person at the front who greeted me and handed me my order was very friendly. We ordered the chicken philly, Italian wrap, and tuna sub. The chicken philly was especially fab- flavorful, not soggy, chicken actually tasted real unlike most sub places that use that horrible rubbery chicken."}
{"text":"Service and food quality has gone downhill since it opened. Jersey Mikes is much better and much more consistent with their quality and products."}
{"text":"Man these are some good subs. Im a big fan of getting your meat sliced right onto your sandwich. They load it up right and have all the good fixens. I always get the club with oil and vinegar which comes with roast beef , turkey, and bacon lettuce tom. and onions. One of the better sub chains."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan. Definitely a knock-off of Jersey Mike's, but nowhere as good. It wasn't bad per se, I just wasn't impressed at all. . Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"An extra star just because of the stellar customer service. People here are SO NICE it is unbelievable.

Note: place your orders via phone if you wanna go in and out fast."}
{"text":"Great subs at decent price. Usually get the chicken philly or buffalo chicken philly. The chicken is flavorful and i like their bread. Their house spicy relish sauce is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"First time in this franchise. I asked the employee was the cheesesteak good? He said they are not that good. Strike 1, the store was not clean strike 2.  And the Philly was bland. Lenny sub shop your out! Great location just no TLC in the place. No upbeat vibe no personal touch. I was disappointed I really wanted a great cheesesteak. Ahhhh the search continues."}
{"text":"Love love love love love this place!

Best subs Charlotte. I like the Italian and the Meatball."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in the University Area! Had the Buffalo Chicken Sub today and my daughter had the Philly Cheese Steak and they were juicy, hot and delicious!  I love their cold sandwiches Lenny's style w hot relish also! And the bread is always soft and yummy."}
{"text":"Me and Lenny's go way back. Like so far back I feel like I can call him Leon. You can't though. You know you don't know Leon like that. Unlike his more charming cousin Mike from Jersey, Leon is not about those games. 

If you're eating in, they will bring your sandwich out to you. And they have a vast assortment of potato chips. This is an old school shop where you get your money's worth. I always leave with a full stomach and a full wallet. They have two TVs and they are never on Fox News which can not be appreciated ENOUGH! Much like their fresh ingredients Lenny's Subs likes their news real.

If you get a sub you have to add banana peppers or the hot pepper relish. It is their specialty. It's a little spicy but in this weather we can all use a sinus clearing right? 

I watched a documentary on Netflix about Amanda Knox she's like the OJ Simpson of Italy. Ya'll know who I'm talking about? Anyways... I think she did it. I don't know man... life is strange. 

But she like she confessed and everything. And her boyfriend confessed. Who confesses to a murder in another country at 20 years old unless they did it? Am I tripping? She also blamed a random black dude from the bar they went to. Like really chick? 

Not feeling that at all. But get your coins boo..."}
{"text":"Solid sub restaurant. Fast and friendly! The food was tasty. I got the buffalo chicken philly. Coke was a little stale. Lines probably just need to be cleaned.   Sandwich was messy but what do you expect? Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"While I'm not new to the Lennys experience, I haven't had them in a while. I brought my coworker here, it was her first time trying it and I must say they did not disappoint. We both have phillys, mine steak, hers chicken. It was delicious as usual the spicy relish truly sets them apart from the competition. In fact it was so good, we came back again the next day . I will continue to be a customer. Also the customer service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Lenny's Sub Shop is a clone of Jersey Mike's.  So if you like Jersey Mike's, you'll probably like Lenny's.  In my opinion their subs are better because the meat is sliced fresh.  The staff here is very friendly and they aim to please.  The price is the same as most other sub shops."}
{"text":"We were greeted with cheer. Great service, and everything was fresh. We were asked how everything was, like a sit-down restaurant. Recommended."}
{"text":"Yep, Lenny's is still three stars good. It was convenient and it was quick and it was good and it was cheap. I had the small cheesesteak with onions and tomatoes. The guy seemed stunned that someone would ask for ketchup on a sandwich that's basically a burger. Is that strange?

Good hot sandwich."}
{"text":"I normally don't review chains but just wanted to give a shout-out to this place. Very clean and A+ customer service.  And hands down the best chain sub shop out there. I just wish there was a Lenny's near me."}
{"text":"I really like Lenny's.  They're such a nice escape from all the other chain sub restaurants, ESPECIALLY Subway, which I'm growing to detest.  This one recently went thru an ownership change but the staff is just as friendly as the original, so no worries there (or w/the quality of food).

When you first order a \"regular\" sub & see the bread they whip out you think, \"wow, that's nothing special\" (in comparison to other places)...but that's before they start PILING on the meat and toppings!  The good folks at Lenny's do NOT skimp on those.  That underwhelming bread loaf very quickly becomes a heaping mass of goodness that will quench most any appetite.  I took my dad here once & he scoffed at the beginnings of his 'samich until he saw the finished product...and could barely finish it (and he can pack away some food!).  

Just came home with a regular turkey on wheat (and they have excellent wheat bread btw), and it was only $6.94 w/tax.  For only about $1.50 or $2 more you can make it a meal - but I'm TRYING to be healthy so I opted for water at home (insert grimace here cuz they have really good sweet tea). Basically the same thing you'd pay at Subway for miniscule toppings on a 6\" sandwich. 

Lenny's reg sub is 7.5\" and twice the size of Subway toppings-wise, and their large is twice that at FIFTEEN inches!  They also have a good selection of salads, as well as hot subs like Philly Cheesesteaks.  Oh, and they also have these \"grilled footlong hot dogs,\" BUT BEWARE - they aren't your ordinary hot dogs, they're more like these ENORMOUS sausages & they're rather oily/greasy...not for the faint of heart (and the reason they're like five/six bucks or something like that).  

So, in short, if you're in the area of this or any of the other Lenny's, give'em a shot - you're sure to be in for a treat.  And you'll certainly be full when you leave!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The prices are a bit higher than a typical chain sandwich shop but they make up for it by pilin on the meat.  They actually slice the meat right in front of you.  And when you get the toppings DO NOT FORGE the pickled chili sauce.  Sometihng like that, I dont' remember the actual term they use.  It is one of those sweet type of hot sauces that just go so well with the sandwich.

Also, do not be fooled.  A \"regular\" is actually almost a footlong.  The large is just enormous, like a party sub from Subway."}
{"text":"Lenny's is a regular lunch spot for me and some of my recent visits have caused me to lower my rating to just average.

There is one guy in here that makes great sandwiches but there are others that ask you what you want on your sandwich and you end up with something completely different.  For example, today's visit.  I asked for oil and vinegar and I received mayonaisse and mustard on and Italian sub.   

On other visits, I said no pickles and I received them anyway.  Granted Lenny's pickles are not your run of the mill pickle but still, NO means NO!

So Lenny's has consistency issues.  Will this stop me from going?  Not likely.  But you just have to watch them around here."}
{"text":"Decent bread and fresh fixings and the staff has been very friendly on my visits.  I would probably rate Lenny's higher overall but the meat is an issue.  First, there is just not enough on it when you get a deli sub.  Not sure about the cheesesteaks as I've not tried them but, they are pretty skimpy on the portions vs. a place like Jersey Mike's.  My other comment on the meat is that the turkey they use is just a weird consistency.  Kind of mushy and watery.  Hard to describe really but, it just has an odd feel as you chew.

All that said, and still an A-OK review?  Yes.  If given the choice between Lenny's and Subway 10 times.  I'm choosing Lenny's..."}
