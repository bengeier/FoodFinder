{"text":"Since new owner ship I have been here twice, 1st time I was disapointed in the menu.  2nd time my friend and got left sitting in Lounge for too long while the bartender played hostess, he had a take a phone call that lasted way too long.  I could see the writing on the wall while we sat and sat.  So we got up and left. I really wish the new Owners ran this better."}
{"text":"Very nice find! I didn't even know this place existed. Excellent food. Nice ambience. We will back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, visiting from Philly and I wanted an upscale relaxing environment with great food options. I had an all around great experience I highly recommend Stonebrook to anyone looking for great food and drinks in the area especially nice patio!"}
{"text":"The food was so good! I went here for brunch and everybody enjoyed their food. The build your own bloody Mary option is great as well. Plus, the staff was very friendly and the ambience very nice."}
{"text":"This place is the best kept secret in Middleburg Hts. It boasts a friendly, fun, and relaxed atmosphere. The staff is amazing (especially Chris' cocktails). Great selection of draft and bottle beers, including my favorite, Hitachino. The food is very high quality with a great price point and features a great build your own section including wraps, salads, pasta, and flatbreads. All fried food is amazingly low on grease because they have an air frier. I absolutely love fried food and their air fried food is better than fried! Couple all of that with a driving range about 20 feet away and you've got a winner! The views of the range are great and there is plenty of space to relax. Definitely give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The other reviews are correct. Well-prepared food: I had the calamari appetizer - (a sweet/hot sauce drizzled over crispy squid) and the salmon with mushroom risotto and asparagus - each was excellent! My Manhattan was delicious. Service was very friendly and prices were reasonable. What's not to like?  Yelp got me the calamari appetizer for free!"}
{"text":"Stonebrook is GREAT (newer eatery in Middleburg near I 71).  We tried a few nights ago and couldn't believe the transformation. \"What a relaxing atmosphere\" They have a upstairs (outdoor) fire-pit and the whole place set-up is very neat with nice Decor !  . The parking lot has what seems like plenty of spaces.(Although the dealership on Pearl seems to have the front property. parking could be better labeled. The attached golf Driving range makes it look as lots of patrons are inside, I would say the night I was there it was 40% in the eatery and 60% out at the range.   We had a great server and Bar/drink  prices were fair for the atmosphere. Bartenders were awesome and super nice ! & Large screen TVs at the Bar. I love the stonework on the walls. This place is a charm.   Food portions seemed just enough (but we had a few Beverages).    Next time I'm up at the top outdoor seating to relax. only 1 more month of Summer and this place has me hooked."}
{"text":"Under New management doors are back open. Come on in we are now called Arnie's Clubhouse Grill!!!!!!!! Lots of new menu selections"}
{"text":"Chicken blue cheese Alfredo was rich and the chicken was tender.  The veggies were grilled to bring out the flavors. The steak was tender and not overly seasoned. The staff was very pleasant. The atmosphere is amazing!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to go to the driving range when we remembered the restaurant was open. After the driving range, we decided to stop for some drinks. The selection was great and the service was even better. I had a Blackberry Brumble and it tasted like juice. We also grabbed some of their dry Cajun wings and they were excellent. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for something to do & great food."}
{"text":"Stonebrook Restaurant is 5 stars hands down, the atmosphere, food and staff are 10 stars! I've visited Stonebrook 3 times in the last month and each one is better than the last ! On my most recent visit I had their Fried Shrimp Po-Boy and Rosemary Fries...Delicious! Go to Stonebrook You wont be disappointed..."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars but this place is a gem. Menu is awesome and so many choices. Atmosphere is very nice. Service was great. Will definitely be back and will tell all of our friends."}
{"text":"Great service and environment.  Kids meal, buffalo chicken wrap and steak wrap all great. Awesome fries.  We will return."}
{"text":"I made a dinner reservation for 14 guests for Tuesday, May 10 & when we arrived we found a sheet of paper taped to the front door that it was \"closed until  May11th\" - ok.  No one had the courtesy to a) Notify me that it was closed, b) or to check their voicemail to respond to my messages CONFIRMING the reservation.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff. Fun and inviting environment. Great selection of beers,wine etc.... Beautiful view. Excellent menu too!!"}
{"text":"I held my daughter's Dedication brunch here back in May. The owner is incredibly sweet and helpful. I was able to use the upstairs private room, which was the perfect size for my group! We were also able to use the deck, and had our own private restroom. Our server was wonderful and the food all came out hot and delicious. I loved it so much that I'm hosting a holiday party here in December :)"}
{"text":"I Chuck personally loved my experience at Stonebrook. I ordered the chicken pad Thai and it was excellent. Great beer selection and staff."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! It's a perfect fit for me and my golf husband. While he is practicing on the golf range, I can sit back and have a drink and watch him.  Tonight after practice, we had dinner there for the first time. OMG!!!! The food is AMAZING!!!!! The Kobe burger was delicious (way better than B Spot) and the Parmesan fries are to die for. Not only that we are considering having an event there after getting a tour and talking with the manager. Such friendly people!  Megan our server is THE BEST! Such a sweetheart. Looking so forward to going back with friends and trying their Brunch. Great job everyone at StoneBrook."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love Stonebrook.  The food is always fantastic and Justin can make a hell of a martini or if you like Whiskey, have him surprise you with a Makers Mark drink, absolutely fantastic.  Give the place a try you won't be disappointed. Chris the manager is such a down to earth guy and if you have an issue he will make it right."}
{"text":"Not sure about this place anymore. It's under new management and things really have changed. We went there the other night and they were closed because they were putting in new kitchen equipment. No sign, no notice...NOTHING, just locked doors. We were meeting a large party there for an anniversary celebration and had to call everyone to meet at another place. Thank goodness for cell phones. Two other couples came to the door while we were in the parking lot calling our friends and experienced the \"lock out\" too. So...sad.   The food keeps changing and prices are high. The happy hour menu seems to be in flux on what they are offering. Hope they get it together soon. We miss the convenience and comradery of this local haunt."}
{"text":"Drinks - yum! Food - yum! It wasn't super fancy food but it was delicious. The bartender Justin was so nice and we had a great night trying a bunch of different things. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Agree it's the best kept secret in Middleburg and can't wait to go back to try more food. The rock shrimp was so yummy, egg rolls better than most. Even the Kalua cake which I thought may b too rich was dense, but light and not overly sweet...perfect. Great drinks as well. The dining room and bar are beautiful and the outdoor seating is super cool. Blonde bartender was friendly and helpful as well as I believe chef at the door. Will review more when I return. Thank you new owner!!"}
{"text":"Service is great, bartender is down to earth and super nice. Owners are very hands on and sweet."}
