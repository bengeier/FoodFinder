{"text":"Went for a late night Jack & Coke with friend and it was great, atmosphere was fantastic and the service was kind and willing to interact.

Going back soon."}
{"text":"Im currently sitting in Trinity and have been here for about 4 hours with family.  

The good.  The atmosphere is great for a pub and they serve Guinness on tap.  The live singer is very versitile and has been a great addition to the restaurant. 

The bad.  Our server who will remain nameless was great when she was here.  After about 1 1/2 hours her shift was over and asked us to settle up which we did in short order.  We all tipped more then the usual as she did a great job.  However, the food was mediocre at best.  Then after sitting in the same table with the same people, making direct eye contact with no less then 3 other waitresses and the manager who I believe was wearing a leafs jersey, we have yet to be asked if there would be anything else or if anyone on the table would like a refill on thier drinks.  By no means was the bar packed as I counted no more then 12 occupied tables at any given time.  Im sorry to say, but we could have easily doubled our bill in that time as there was both the nba and nhl games that we were watching.  In short, good atmosphere, short on food and service and the drinks were a little light. Wont be returning."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Trinity and I finally remembered to take pictures or I would've blogged about this long ago. It's a big, beautiful pub in the theatre complex. There's lots of seating, lots of TVs and a small stage. 

2 out of 3 experiences were lack luster. The first time was with my friend and it was busy. We knew there would be a wait and when they told us 20 minutes, not bad. I knew from being a hostess myself, that on a busy night, the wait is NEVER 20 minutes. 30 minutes later, we were irritated. I was willing to wait quietly, but she was not. She went to the hostess and complained. The manager apologized and we were seated 10 minutes later. He was nice enough to offer us a free appetizer to make up for the wait. Fair enough. We chose the spinach dip, but they gave us cheap tortilla chips instead of the pita that should come with it. The food was just ok. I had the Cottage Pie and she had the Fish and Chips. 

The second time, it was that same friend's birthday. We had a large group and the service was good. We all ordered some apps and everyone enjoyed themselves. They have an excellent beer selection! 

My final visit with my boyfriend will probably be the last. We both ordered fish and chips. I know British food has been known to be boring, but wow. This was boring. The fish batter was alright. The tartar sauce was horrible. I LOVE tartar sauce and this was bad, tasted like vinegar and there shouldn't be vinegar in it! BOOO!

I was hoping one of my visits would turn it around for me, but it just didn't. 

At least the service was good!"}
{"text":"We've been one other time several months ago and remember the food being very good.  So for my grandmother's birthday we decided to give it another try.  My dad called ahead to make a reservation for our party of 7.  Got in with only half our party, were seated promptly but without menus.  By the time the remainder of our party had arrived we had still not received our menus.  When someone finally came over he asked for our drink order, and we then had to point out we still had yet to even receive our menus.  So he went and got them, didn't come back.  We then had to flag down a waitress where we placed our food and drink order at the same time.  Drinks took several minutes to come, not bad.  However I'm pretty sure they had to go fishing to get our fish and chips, it took a good 35-45 minutes to get our food.  When our food did come, one of our meals was wrong and another did not come as requested (salad dressing on the side).  When we asked the waitress to see the menu (to make sure we were not in the wrong with the mixed up meal), she then ran away and we could not tell her about the mixup. So one of the members of our party went to ask for the manager.  His response was \"I'll comp it\" not I'm sorry for the mixup, is there anything i can do, no \"I'll comp it\".  The guest whose food came out wrong then had to get up and go find someone to get her the correct meal.
I will say however when we did all get our correct meals, the food was amazing! The mashed potatoes are great, fish and ships was good and so were the burgers.  
I would recommend only going in for take out.  The easy fix to this fiasco, in the beginning apologize for the delay and tell us you're short staffed (they blamed it on this as we were leaving). Then don't just drop the food without so much as a word after everyone else in the party has already finished their meal.  The management here (or well the gentlemen who was referred to as a manager) needs to learn some guest service or get out of the industry.  We won't be going back, which is disappointing because the food really is good."}
{"text":"Great food and service, a very welcoming traditional Pub atmosphere. Came in on a Monday and they had half priced appies, a great deal and really tasty!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of British and Irish ale, which is why you can get me into the door of a place like Trinity, but don't care as much for heavy Irish pub fare. But I was Starving (capital \"S\" starving) and had to eat something along with that beautiful pour of a Boddingtons on draft. Apparently not that many people in the Whitby area like Irish food either, based on the fact that there were only 4 tables occupied in the joint. This lack of patrons most likely also helps explain the sullen, depressed energy of all the staff. They are all sort of bored & apathetic. With all of this said, my shepard's pie was rich and meaty and hearty -  nice & filling on a cold Toronto night. They have nightly specials which you may want to check out, like half-priced starters on Monday. This place has a unique selection of beers and unique menu items that you won't find at most places. That makes it worth investigating!"}
{"text":"I have to say the staff here went out of their way to make our experience memorable.

After waiting 40 minutes for the rest of our party to arrive, we had to leave. When we went to pay for the two Coke's we'd had, they told us not to worry about it.

When we did return later that afternoon, we sat down and had a great meal on the patio. I will say the Cottage Pie was very tasty, and I was sad when it was gone :("}
{"text":"After reading several reviews slamming the service I was leery to try...

However, the food was very good and we had no trouble with service and in fact I would say it was well above average as we had the server visit us several times as well as the floor manager who asked us how we liked each dish and was open and genuinely interested in feedback/discussion

Items we had were: 

Calamari ( below average- bit too much batter and a bit tough)
Cottage meat pie ( excellent)
Corn beef Boxty - (average to ok - a bit heavy but flavour good)

Salads accompanying the meal were above average and the a house vinaigrette excellent.

Would give it another try for sure and would give 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night and were greeted by two friendly hostess. No wait at all which was a plus and we were promptly seated at a booth beside the window.

It's a spacious pub with a large bar located in the centre, stone floors, dark wood, fire place and a live band playing.

The menu has typical pub fare with some Irish specialties as well as changing daily specials. They use only fresh, in-season fruits and vegetables grown locally by  Ontario farmers which is a nice touch.

We decided to order a few different apps to munch on

BBQ Chicken Flat Bread - BBQ spiced chicken breast, crisp flat bread, red onions, golden pineapple, three cheese blend and fresh cilantro
I liked the combo of flavours, gooey cheese and tangy bbq sauce plus the crust was thin and crisp and held up well against the toppings.

Chicken Wings - 1lb with Honey Garlic Sauce
Nice and saucy a good portion of meaty wings

Chimichurri Steak Salad - Grilled Flank steak with fresh chimichurri on a bed of spring greens tossed w/ balsamic vinaigrette. garnished with charred corn, roasted yellow peppers, sweet grape tomatoes, & served w/ grilled crostinis
Beautifully presented, huge piece of perfectly cooked medium rare tender juicy steak. I liked the addition of charred veggies and the chimichurri was very flavourful!

Overall a pretty nice pub in the heart of Whitby serving up good pub fare and live Entertainment!"}
