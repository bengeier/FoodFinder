{"text":"I have been here twice. Once for breakfast about a week ago and today for dinner. For breakfast I had the Chicken Fried Steak with Sausage Gravy and Biscuits. This was good. The chicken fried steak was crisp but not overcooked, the sausage gravy had a good amount of sausage and was very flavorful. The biscuits were also good. My companion had three blueberry pancakes. These were very large and she raved about how good they were. For our dinner selections we had the barbecue 1/2 chicken and the meatloaf sandwich. The chicken was very tender and the sauce, while not homemade, was tangy and pretty good. The meatloaf got a good review from my Mom. she loved the gravy. We had very good service on both trips. This is not a fine dining establishment, but for a tasty, well prepared homestyle meal at a good price this is a really good option."}
{"text":"Would not eat in this restaurant ever again... last meal was unbelievable.  Kitchen was really slow & the people in the booth behind us were complaining, as well.  The ribs my husband got were dry & frankly almost inedible.  The pasta & shrimp I got was watery & tasteless.  The salad bar was sloppy to say the least.  What little we ate was not worth the charge.  The only good thing was our waitress...she did all she could & I told her the only reason we stayed was because she was so pleasant - she deserved her tip"}
{"text":"Had not been to this establishment in several months due to our last visit not being very good but decided to try it again always seems busy usually if a place is busy the food is good.  Well sorry to say I was disappointed again although the service and the waitress was very nice and friendly and the food again was just mediocre at best.   It was Friday night so I decided to try the fried perch it was very very very dry, seemed over cooked and way too much breading and no fish.  The fish at Long John Silver's it's much better.  My wife had a sandwich I believe it was chicken she was satisfied with that.  We got desert to go again we were not very satisfied with that, i've had much better pie elsewhere.   I gave it two stars because my wife said her sandwich was OK otherwise it will just be one star I've learned my lesson never going back."}
{"text":"Upon arrival,  we were seated quickly. Our waiter was quick to take our order. Our meals included one trip to the salad buffet which had soups and typical salad bar items. The Italian wedding soup's noodles were over cooked, but the chicken noodle soup looked amazing. Then the wait began.  We sat for an extremely long time waiting for our main courses. I have been told by others who frequently eat here, that this is not typical. My husband enjoyed his prime rib and my mac and cheese was good, but could have used more salt. Our cinnamon rolls were delivered like a dessert and were generously iced.  We felt the meal was average,  but many of our family love this place so it may have been an off night."}
{"text":"Being a fan of the Perry Family Restaurant (PFR), and knowing that this one is owned by the same people, I wanted to try this place.  I was very impressed as to how they had fixed this place up.  I could remember when this used to be Dutch Pantry and the old video rental place as well as that other restaurant.  

The food and portions were very good, they had a nice salad bar, but I was disapointed to see that they did not add a buffet bar like the Perry place has. I guess that had to be given up since there would not be any place to put it. 

All in all, I think a very nice place for Mentor.  I know he Lexus driving crowd from Mentor will more than likely not come here, but for those looking for a good meal, at a decent price will flock to this place.  I know I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was good, our server Drew, was very personable and attentive. The menu is right priced for an easy family dinner. The mozzarella appetizer is fantastic, you have to go there just to try that!"}
{"text":"My family drove past and they were pretty busy, so we decided to stop by and have breakfast.  We usually go to JT's in willoughby, let just say I will be returning to JT's from now on. The food itself wasn't bad the service on the other hand was awful.  We were sat quickly but our server took awhile to get to our table.  She didn't greet us, all she said was \"what can I get you to drink\".  It took her at least 5 minutes to get our drinks.  She took our order and when I asked for another set of silverware she actually rolled her eyes at me when she walked away.  Oh sorry there was three of us and we only had two sets.  Food came out and it was tasty. But trying to get a warm up on coffee was like pulling teeth. She never came back to see if we needed anything. She ran past and threw the bill on the table. Basically letting us know it was time for us to leave.  Needless to say we won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking. Big restaurant with booths and tables. Neat, clean.  Great breakfast, not so thrilled with the dinner I got here."}
{"text":"The WORST dining experience ever!! My wife, kids and I live in Mentor and restaurants owners as well thought we should try the new family restaurant for dinner.  I ordered the country fried chicken and they brought out country fried steak with only one side to choose from then brought out chicken with beef gravy all over to hide it wasn't done in the center. Son ordered grilled chicken wrap no shredded cheese but put a sandwich slice of cheese in it.....who does  that!!?? The wrap was also cold. The only side they had was corn which looked like it was in a pot all day. Didn't eat anything but one son ate kids burger but didn't like the corn. Told waiter not satisfied to take away food and he returns with full bill. Asked for manager and they said there was no manager and nothing they could do and we were still billed for food we sent back. Never again will go there and I suggest you don't go either!!"}
{"text":"Visited last night with my wife as we were passing en route to The Outback; but we decided to try here instead for a change as there were lots of cars in the lot and we hadn't noticed it before. We were seated promptly and our server, Jessica, came over quickly and explained the menu options well and then got us our drinks. I had the all meat omelette and subbed fries for the home fries and had the wheat toast. My wife tried the All American omelette and fries also. The omelettes themselves were HUGE. Half the portion would have been plenty; and I took half home in a box. It was very tasty and hot; and the fries were clean and fresh and hot also. The d√©cor is nice enough; and it has been there since October 2013 according to our server. We enjoyed our meal and will probably return to sample the breakfast menu in the future. The place has a nice family \"feel\" to it and I would recommend it if you're in the Mentor area. It is way more modern looking/feeling than its \"sister\" location in Perry."}
{"text":"Good food with many choices. The salad & soup buffet is always plentiful. The speed of service depends upon which server you get but they're always willing to get you what you need. Open and airy inside, not too loud."}
{"text":"For casual dining this place has it all!!!  Modern, clean environment
Great food!!!  Portions are plentiful and most entrees come with a trip to the soup and salad bar, which can also be had unlimited as your meal. Lot of good homemade comfort entrees!!!
Friendly, attentive service
And the value for your money can't be beat, most dinner entrees including the soup and salad bar are around $10. 
Great place for families, big tables and long booths to accommodate. 
Will DEFINITELY return"}
{"text":"Some of the food could be a lot better (I'd stay away from their chicken.....very dry...seemed boiled) but the quick and friendly service is GREAT and the space between tables is second to none. Did I mention clean?! If they could work on their food (too many menu items really) a bit I'd give them 4-5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Service is good.  Love the Mediterranean Shrimp bake, but opted for chicken salad and salad bar instead today.  Mom has a grilled chicken wrap which she says  is great."}
{"text":"It was okay.  The salad bar was clean and had fresh items.  It was well stocked.  The cod I got was...okay.  My mom got fried chicken with sausage gravy,  She was unimpressed.  For the person who complained about beets being on the salad bar...I love them and always get them.  So does mom.  I would go again, but probably stick to breakfast.  It looks like that might be their thing.  One thing...it was CLEAN and that is great.  Service was fine.  Our server was new, but she did a decent job.  A little slow, but that could be the kitchen,"}
{"text":"Been here few times once for breakfast, typical simple breakfast that was average, came for lunch did sandwiches was again safe and average. Today we decided to do dinner, BIG mistake! I got the butter crusted cod \"special\" mashed potatoes and green beans, lets just breakdown my dinner first. the potatoes fake & ice cold with gfs thick as molasses canned brown gravy to go along with the mushy canned green beans then their was the cod! The first bite tasted odd I said self take another maybe its just the breading combo second bit in the center was way worse it smelled and tasted bitter and spoiled let alone real mushy! that was a good sign their frozen pre- breaded cod was hanging around thawed out too long and I didn't take another bite and now am hoping it wasn't as rotted as it tasted. The other three dinners my table got although not rotten-to taste but instead very very  low quality like the\"homemade meatloaf\" .
We have eaten at many many places had our share of sub par meals but in fifty years this is by far the worst meals we have ever been served. That I can not even compare it to anything.  
The owner needs to rely a little less on gfs/ sysco low quality frozen and canned goods and maybe hire a little talent that can cook beyond a can opener and microwave. And never take a menu item like the butter crusted cod and run it as a \"dinner special\" when its a menu item served just as the menu offers. That should have been my first clue of them offing some thawed out dated food inventory. You can look at all my reviews and I have never been this critical or mean about a place but it makes you mad when your served canned/ frozen  food and that even gets screwed up !!!!"}
{"text":"I have gone here plenty of times with my family. We always liked coming her until last Saturday I placed my order with the waitress who may have been new I have never seen her before. Well needless to say the order came to the table wrong everyone else got what they ordered and correctly I might add. When she placed the plate down I  let her know this was not what I ordered I ever had my finger pointing to the correct meal on the menu while I ordered. She was quick to snap back at me like I placed the order wrong which was not the case. Needless to say I have been in the customer service business for over 18 years and one thing I have always learned and have been told is the customer is always right regardless of the situation and you never ever respond to the customer with an attitude. I most likely will not come back. One bad experience with me is enough to check it off my list. Sorry it was a good and affordable place to eat."}
{"text":"Great service - our waitress Jessica was awesome and made excellent recommendations for dinner!   Very cozy, quiet and wonderful food - Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo very good and my friend had the \"melt in your mouth\" roast beef !

Recommending to everyone!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, updated atmosphere. Went for breakfast....service was a little slow as far as getting coffee refills and a complete order on the table with toast. Sausage links are small and likely from a frozen bag....not like other family restaurants. Price was avg-moderate. The place is still new so might try again sometime....maybe lunch or dinner. Salad/soup bar looked fresh."}
{"text":"Out looking for a place for breakfast before heading to mall. What a find. Staff so nice . Clean place and great menu.  Full salad bar!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for dinner per the request of my oldest daughter.   My Father goes here with his group of friends and has taken my daughter here after music lessons.  Mind you I have just worked 12 hours straight without a lunch so at 615 pm starving. Waitress tells me how they are known for how wonderful their steaks are so I order medium rare. My steak comes out cooked welk past done..like rawhide. Waitress leaves to talk to the manager comes and offers to make a new steak so it does back and second one comes out after my family has finished their meals.  Second steak is raw not even rare but raw so the waitress once again goes to talk to the manager and offers to make a third steak before she will adjust the bill. Obviously at this point I'm over this place and just want to go home. Waitress comes back stating the manager has finally agreed to take the meal off of my bill not ONCE did she come over to apologize. Per the waitress the manager had an attitude about the entire matter.  Being in management myself I would ever allow one of my patients concerns to go unaddressed by myself personally. My husband and I politely explained that we will not be back and I will make sure to share my thoughts.  The staff was wonderful and the restaurant very clean but the overall service made it crap.  Told the host they need a new manager to keep customers.  Wouldn't recommend the steak"}
{"text":"Party of 2 went on a Thursday night.  We were seated right away.  Waiter took our order and expressed firmly one trip to the soup & salad bar.  We started with the soup.  Navy bean was like baked beans - very tasty.  Chicken noodle had homemade noodles and pieces of chicken the size of my pointer finger.  VERY HOT!

Salad bar was good - everyone was loading up for their one trip.  Good selection of extra's - would have like to see basic mac or potato salad.  They did have cottage cheese and two types of pasta salad.  

Dinner was served.  Waiter got my order completely wrong - but within 15 minutes the right order arrived piping hot.

My friend ordered the roast beef dinner, mashed potato's and green beans.  I had the 1/2 slab of ribs with baked potato and green beans.

All meals are served with dinner roll, garlic bread or cinnamon roll.  We both got the garlic bread.  Good - not salty, as sometimes it is.

*** NOTE:  Waiter should have told us the green beans had bacon flavor in them.  FOR VEGETARIANS.  

Everything was delicious.  By the time I finished my salad, I was done for the night.  Brought my entire meal home.  So did my friend.

Sauce on ribs was very good, roast beef could be cut with a fork.  We saw the special of the night being served; Stuffed Peppers.  Two whole peppers stuffed & over flowing.  EXCELLENT PORTIONS.

No refills on pop - we had sweet tea which came with refills.  Our bill was $22.00 for both of us.  

Very very pleased with this new owner and what they have done with the building - well lit, bright and open.  Great service - salad bar was kept up and kept clean.  Refills coming out of the kitchen several times during our meal.

OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Market Street Family Restaurant.  8450 Market Street, Mentor, OH. 44060.  440-255-4962.  

WELL WORTH THE TRIP!!!!!"}
{"text":"The ribs are excellent (so says the husband); comperable to Smokey Bones but at a very reasonable price. I had the salad bar. It's clean and fresh but not a lot of variety for the cost. Comes with a selwction of soup od the day or chille. Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always clean. I've never had a bad meal here. Tony the owner makes everyone feel st home and like they're family. This place has the charm and atmosphere of a really nice bar and grill, but the family good menu.. salad bar is always well kept, can't say enough. Hostess was sweet, breakfast was delicious"}
{"text":"Our first visit to this restaurant.    The inside had 2 nice fire places.   They had a soup and salad bar , which is included with the dinners.   The waitress recommended pot roast , which my friend ordered and she said very tender.   We ordered the roast beef, which was a huge portion.  Everything was good.   Would definitely return. Good value !"}
{"text":"I tried Market Street Family Restaurant for the first time tonight. First impressions were all good; very clean inside and friendly people greeting guests at the door. The dining area just feels good. Maybe it is because of the wood paneling or because the furniture is solid but it's just comfy. The menu is diverse and quite inexpensive. The salad bar looked fresh and lively even at 8PM. The server was extremely helpful with making suggestions and encouraged us to come back for breakfast. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"gotta say this place was a total surprise .. it is much nicer on the inside than I imagined .. I love a place that offers a soup & salad bar as a quick lunch option .. theirs was well stocked with fresh produce & other offerings & the chicken noodle soup + chili offered were delicious .. we will be back .."}
{"text":"I think this place could be good. I've been there a few times with my family and we were happy with what came on our plates. But another reviewer said they served corn, and I agree, both times we were there, we got corn. I hate corn. Also, the salad bar needs some help-big time. It's small, but could be decent if they kept track of getting spoiled stuff off it and didn't put the cheapest of the cheap, as far as ingredients go. I mean, who eats beets??? Also, the rolls or cinnamon rolls are heated in the microwave before being delivered; makes the rolls hard, rubbery, and inedible, every time. I'm not getting why they don't have them in a steam table? Then, where the heck is the wait staff? Not serving the customers, that's for sure! Get it together or end up like your predecessors!"}
{"text":"First time here as we had a coupon and was unsure of the place . Pleasantly surprised . EXCELLENT soup and salad bar , everything was very fresh and many selections .

The pot roast dinner was melt in your mouth . 

Definitely will be back ."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast...I had the western omelette (ham, onions, green pepper), which came with home fries and toast. Everything was good! I was totally stuffed and ready to take a nap afterward (late brunch/breakfast goal achieved). 

Coffee was typical for this type of casual family restaurant, not too strong, pretty mild, but it was unlimited, so that's a plus. 

Waitress was so friendly and service was quick. 

I recommend for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I've been craving a good salad bar for forever and there were reviews saying they had a good one here. I have one word: BacO's. :( Macaroni salad was yuck, cottage cheese was weird, and... BACO'S. 

My son ordered first the shrimp scampi which  came with over steamed soggy corn and a baked potato that wasn't done. The shrimp was over lemony and over cooked. We sent it back and he got the breakfast stuff (scrambled eggs, pancakes, hash browns) and while it was edible, the best way to describe it was  \"institutional\". Bland, slightly rubbery, and unremarkable

I had high hopes but my search for a decent salad bar continues."}
{"text":"This restaurant had a great, hometown feel. It was cozy and family-friendly. The service was very quick and courteous. The salad bar was fresh. The prices were reasonable for the portions. I had Chicken Broccoli Alfredo. It was served hot and was delicious! Not too rich! My daughter had French Toast and she really enjoyed it. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The food and service here are excellent. Dinners are plentiful and at a reasonable price. Best part, there's a salad bar! Who doesn't love the ability to customize your own salad before a meal? I ordered the panko breaded shrimp for 9.99. My meal came with green beans, roll, and a baked potato. The shrimp was delicious."}
