{"text":"Fun place, good people, pub food! Would like to see a vegan option or 2, but they custom made something for me. Will be back for brews!"}
{"text":"This is a great bar with really good food. The hamburgers, fries, and sandwiches are great. I have to repeat this - the french fries are really great, some of the best in town. The specials can vary in quality, sometimes they are just okay and sometimes they are amazing. The flatbreads are usually a great choice. Overall, the food here is reliably good. The bar area is fun and friendly - the side room is okay for overflow. In warm weather it is nice to have the patio option.  The only negative, and I hope they read this - is the ladies room. It is absolutely the most disgusting bathroom I have seen in the US. The floor, fixtures, walls, everything needs to be replaced. It is broken down and filthy. I have to go with the theory that the kitchen is a lot cleaner."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with five people. The food was great, though it took ages to come out. Our waiter was very attentive but was a downer and unpleasant to be around. I'd come back but not with the same waiter."}
{"text":"The new tavern is really cool.good food.JOsh is a awesome bertender..this is the new cool spot to have a drink ."}
{"text":"My husband was visiting CH and stumbled across this place via a recommendation.  He's now back here in Ann Arbor and has been sitting here raving about The Tavern Company.  So I'm entering this review on his behalf.  Among many things he said was \"best coleslaw of my life!\""}
{"text":"Have tried The Tavern a few times since taking over the Colony's space and have been disappointed each time. Food ok but in some cases overpriced for bar food. Twice we have had the same waiter who could care less about service even when it was not busy. Never came to check after food arrived nor if we would like another drink. Once he brought the bill, never bothered to come back and pick it up even though he passed our table any number of times. At one point, he was on his cell phone right next tonour table. There are plenty of local places to dine and unfortunately, this local establishment isn't on our list anymore."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great staff, and the make over is amazing...feels like a speakeasy now. Recommend the chili lime wings, the steak quesadilla, and the Camp Flyer sandwich. Never had bad service or food."}
{"text":"Really good bar food * excellent service = a great local establishment we will visit frequently. Our server was awesome. Don't know his name, but he followed us outside because we left our 3 yo sons apples at the table. He's always quick and friendly that makes for an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"The food here was great I'll try the wings if you looking to drink eat and play a lil pool"}
{"text":"Ok everyone, These tacos are really, really good, they are called Spicy Asian Pork Tacos, 3 tacos 9 bucks, try them and let the tacos do the talking. Note: must be 21- it is a bar. Also, I tried the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders - excellent. The new chef is pounding out the some really good eats.  Check them out - new owners and chef since Jan 1, 2017"}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be a winner by the reviews here but I was wrong. The calamari came out hot after a 15 min. wait but the sauce was bland at best. $11 not well spent. My buddy ordered the thai chicken wrap which also left something to be desired as the sauce was the same as on tje calamari and the sauce wasn't sweet or chili or garlicky as it claimed to be. My chicken salad was okay, but the dressing was a vinegarette but it was more like an oilette maybe with a hint of vinegar. The decor looked like a tavern if by tavern you mean someone's crappy basement.  I should have gotten a burger, those looked better.  Also evidently they had specials but I only heard them being said by our waiter while walking by another table on the way out."}
{"text":"The people here are so awesome! They made me feel so at home! The staff hungout with us! The food is great and so are the drinks! I will definitely be coming back. I'm still here, party on!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last month and. both experiences were disappointing.  The first time was the day that the owner of The Colony was killed.  My friend had made reservations to sit on the patio but when we arrived we were told that we couldn't sit on the patio even though people who had arrived after us were seated there and there was room for our party.  We sat inside and the place was packed with people who worked at The Colony or friends of people who worked there or people who knew Jim Brennan and were mourning his death.  Service was understandably slow that night and I don't hold that against them.  I think they were totally unprepared for the number of people who showed up. What I do have a problem with was not honoring our patio reservation. The second time we ordered carry out. We looked at a menu on line and when I called to order I was given a total that seemed way too high for what we ordered. We looked at the menu again, added up the prices and my husband called back to inquire about the discrepancy. He was told that the prices had recently gone up but they had not changed them on the web site yet. They also failed to tell me when I ordered, that when they ask \"do you want fries, onion rings or a salad with your burger\" they charge extra for the salad but not for the fries or onion rings. My husband tried to make the point that they should be more explicit about this and if they didn't have time to change their prices on their website they should honor the prices that are printed there. He tried to argue this point again when he went to pick up the food but was told there was nothing that anyone could do.  The food on both occasions was good but not great and we won't be hurrying back there because of these customer service issues.  I look forward to The Colony opening up again for many reasons, one of which is that I would go there any day instead of going to the Tavern Company."}
{"text":"Excellent spot and Colette is an awesome bartender, been here twice and have enjoyed playing pool and chatting with the staff!! Come check it out"}
{"text":"Great local spot.  Good wings.  Went on a sunday afternoon for happy hour with the girls, the bartender was very accommodating and nice."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in quite awhile and I'm from Chicago! All the food we had was hand made and really really wonderful."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places on Lee Road. The moment that you walk through the door you are greeted with a huge smile and hello.  Whether you are sitting at the bar or at a table, the service is always exceptional.    Everything on the menu is great but you can never go wrong with any of their burgers.  The MO burger is my personal favorite.  Smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions, and mushrooms on a handmade bun.  Life is great when eating that!  The Veggie burger is excellent as well.  It is made in house, served with greens on-top, a great aioli and a handmade multi-grain bun.  It's a beautiful thing!"}
{"text":"New-ish ownership!   The bad news: The Monday night $5 burger-beer special is gone.   The good news: The food is better!   But I'm still torn.   Bad news: I miss the authentic homeyness of TavCo days gone by.   Good news: The service no longer sucks! (In fact, it's really good).  So what's my problem, right? Am I just a nostalgic bar mollusk? I don't know. My one real complaint is that the bathrooms still look like dive bar bathrooms. If they'd just take all that money they are making on their new $9 burger-beer special (!!!) and put it into a new bathroom, I might be sold for life.  Or better yet, if they'd just lower their prices a little bit, this mollusk might just attach to a new hull.  Anyway, the new TavCo is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I used to go here when it was truly a dive. I prefer it much more now. Still inexpensive and low key, but with way more TV's and food that is beyond what any other bar is doing. The best wings EVER...ever, ever, ever, ever. It's so awesome to finally have a great neighborhood bar near us. I feel like this is such a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I have been to TavCo a few times in the past 4 years.  The more recent the visit, the better the experience.  The new ownership has done a wonderful job of cleaning the place up.  The menu is much larger, and the food is really good for \"Bar Food\".  They carry the traditional bar fare along with some more interesting options.  We split a flatbread with Apples, Prosciutto, Dates, and Goat Cheese.  Awesome!  They run specials thoughout the whole week.  We were there on a Tuesday night and the four of us did Trivia.  I was skeptical as it was my first time every doing it, but we ended up having a blast.  Even got a few bucks off our bar tab.    One one side of the place you have the bar with some booths, and the other side has more of a restaurant feel.  Food is defiantly better than the Cedar Lee \"Pub\", and this place doesn't turn into a punch palace.  Seriously, how do you beat 16 ounce PBR's for 2 bucks??"}
{"text":"The best part about Tav Co is by far the Monday Night burger and a beer for $5.  I am not a huge fan of red meat or hamburgers, but they are very good!    The rest of the food is pretty good as well.  The drinks are always made well and all of the bartenders are nice, I have never had a bad experience there.  They have other specials throughout the week, but I pretty much only  go on Mondays."}
{"text":"The food is OK... if you can get the wait staff to do there job. They take forever, generally are rude, even when it's not crowded. Even when it is crowded do your job and have some respect for yourself and the customer. Anyways It's bar food so don't expect much. They do have a decent beer selection, but the price mark up for being in a mildly trendy area is nuts. I've been a few times and wouldn't consider going back, better places are all over the place around here."}
{"text":"I use to frequent Tavern Co (TavCo)10 years ago but mainly for a bar scene and never tried their food.  Until Thanksgiving weekend, my brother-in-law suggested that we all go there for dinner. I thought he had grown two horns on his head because I was baffled at the notion of eating at TavCo-- BUT we thought we'd give it a whirl and I am so glad that I gave it the chance that it so well deserves.    My first dining adventure I had ordered the soft shell crab sandwich and it was fantastic!   The crab was delicate yet crispy without being greasy or overtaken by the batter and it was accompanied by a mound of delicious french fries!  Since that meal, I've been a frequent diner at TavCo.  I think they have one of the best burgers around and I recently tried their Hangar Steak special and OMG it was phenomenal!!  The meat was cooked perfectly and was tender and those mashed potatoes are to die for!  Creamy, buttery, silky-- everything a mashed potato should be!  I use to go to the Colony to eat but since finding out that this place has better food, I haven't returned to Colony -- I find their food a bit on the greasy and burnt side.    If you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere for a drink or somewhere to get really delicious food, think about heading to Tavern Company for your next meal!  You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot. A local bar that makes you feel like home. Kaleb is an amazing bartender and is always on point. He remembers who you are and what you drink. If he is not pouring a drink he is talking to you or cleaning. Always on the move. Josh is your neighborhood jokester. If you are having a bad day, see josh and you will leave in laughter. Ginger is amazing. Not only is she beautiful but she is a great bartender as well. She is quick witted and will keep you on your toes. Ryan is quite and makes you feel at home. If you ever get hungry, you will eat well and have the best bar food in town. Nick is a chef and could easily work the strip but would rather bring that quality and passion to your local watering hole. So stop hopping around and come here where you are family not a customer."}
{"text":"This place could easily be a 4 star or even 5 star if their bartender hadn't been so standoffish.  Drinks were fine.  They have Strongbow and the mixed drinks were of an acceptable strength.  Service was ok time-wise.  It was pretty busy when we arrived so we decided to sit at the bar, mostly because it looked like there was only one server for all the tables.  The service was prompt but I can't explain how awkward this bartender made me feel.  No attempt to be cheerful, smile, or talk to us at all.  Would not even make eye contact with us most of the time.  Have no idea how this man makes any tips.  There was another bartender who seemed fairly friendly, but he was mostly waiting on the tables.  In hindsight I wish we had sat at a table.  My turkey burger was really good and the fries were ok.  I won't come back here because of their bartender, which is too bad because they have a lot of other good things going for them."}
{"text":"Went in to use a Living Social deal that I had purchased on our way to the Panthers game.  Charged me $20 to park, but offered a $10 voucher in the restaurant.  Was greeted promptly and seated ourselves.  It was all downhill after that.  Server was clueless.  We ordered the nachos and requested no black beans.  Waited 15 to 20 minutes and nachos came out.  Huge portion with lots of toppings, but had black beans all over.  Server came by and asked if everything was okay.  I told him the nachos had black beans, which we asked to leave off.  He said sorry and walked away.  Had to flag him down again for silverware and plates.  I would understand if it was busy, but the bar area was half full and the dining room was empty.  I see why!  Bill came and was charged $13 for the nachos.  I asked if we could use the voucher another time as we had the living social coupon, he said no, it had to be used that day.  That will be the first and last time I go there!  Nothing that great about the place.  It hasn't changed since the last time I went there 15 years ago.  Food was bland and service was worse!"}
{"text":"Came on a date, haha, the waitress was friendly and the chef even came out to say hi since it wasn't busy.  Has a pool table I didn't get to use, maybe next time. The food was tasty, drinks were strong enough. Pretty good spot I would stop by again."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection. Really solid food since the new management. Weekend brunch is great too, especially since its still under the radar so no super long wait like some places."}
{"text":"GROSS BAR FOOD POSING under an elevated cuisine guise.  I've been patronizing this local establishment for years to keep money in Cleveland Heights, but bad service and quite frankly low quality, poorly cooked food has literally left a bad taste in my mouth.  The calamari is overly coated with god knows what and fried within an inch of its life.  The steak on the steak salad is simply poor quality, gray meat.  After years of sub par take out and supporting this mediocre bar, I asked for a complimentary dessert.  The tav co employee assured me - yes dessert included.  True to form,  when we looked through the order at home:  NO PROMISED dessert, crappy steak, and of course onions on burger when we asked for no onions (happens EVERY time).  Time to upgrade to McDonald's.  Done paying $50 for fast food."}
{"text":"Customer service is slow. I seated at the bar and they dont take your order until 15 min later. The food option is limited."}
{"text":"Well, it happened again!  We went for a simple dinner and received one of the best meals we have ever had. Let me start by saying we ordered two specials that were not on the menu. Wow, it was worth it!  We had two meals totally different but amazingly spectacular. The pasta special was out of this world!  Somehow the chef figured out how to bring every flavor into one dish to make an explosion of flavor. Thank you.   We can't wait for the opportunity to return to this simple, \"bar\", with 5 star food!"}
{"text":"The Tavern used to be Morehead Street Tavern (which closed down) but has recently changed management and opened up under the name, The Tavern.  I am very partial to The Tavern, simply because it is right across the street from my apartment. Thus, the convenience is a HUGE plus.   On the outside, The Tavern just looks like any run of the mill bar. However, on the inside, it opens up into this HUGE space. I couldn't even believe it when I first walked in. We have taken many friends here and they were in shock at the size of the place.  The first floor is the main bar with a separate large room for pool tables. There is an overlook to the dance floor that is located on the bottom floor. The bottom floor contains multiple bars and large dance floor with a stage. There is also a very large outdoor patio with an outdoor stage and bar. The facility at this place is phenomenal! Unfortunately, since they are so new, there isn't currently a ton of people at the bar. Thus, most people just stay upstairs at the main bar/pool table area. Once they start bringing in bands and filling this place up, it will be an incredible venue.  We have had the food here. The collard dip is delicious and the wings were also very good too! The drink specials are very good. The past few times we have been it has been $2 for beer and usually a few more for mixed drinks.   I can't wait for this place to get more busy and I love stopping over there for a quick drink mid-week!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place on accident.  We were looking for dinner but when we went in, it looked like a bar without food.  The signs say that they are under construction so maybe they are building a proper dining area but for now it was just basically some table and chairs on the side.  We almost walked out but are so glad that we stayed.  The bartender came over and she was awesome.   I wish I had gotten her name to give the proper thanks.  The menu was what you would expect - wings, pizza, burgers, quesadillas but the food was way better than we expected.  The steak quesadillas surprised me the most.  The steak was easy to chew and perfectly proportioned to the cheese.  Hubby had the wings and ended up ordering more to go.   The wings are fried, sauced, grilled then sauced again which is the perfect way to make wings!   We had two of the burgers, one with fries and one with onion rings.  I'm not a big ring fan but I highly suggest you try them here.  There was only one dessert on the menu so we gave it a go.  If you like cookie dough then this is the bomb.  I don't remember what it was called but it was basically cookie dough and melted chocolate inside an eggroll and served with ice cream.  It was way too much for two of us to eat so make sure to share.  We rounded off the night with some darts and a little video poker.  The only downsides were the missing tips on the darts they provide, the lack of a recognizable dining area which I believe they are working on and the pictures that are posted on yelp of the food (I didn't take pictures but what we were served was way better looking than what is posted)."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence concerning TavCo. We went for some beer and food one night and I was so distracted by the menu!! In a good way, of course. I couldn't for the life of me decide between the Thai wrap, the apple sandwich, the chicken sandwich, and the turkey burger special. It was all so tantalizing! I went with the special and regret it. I couldn't stop thinking about that apple sandwich after taking my first bite of the burger. Needless to say it wasn't entirely thrilling, and the shallot aoli was good, but way too strong.  The fries, on the other hand were delicious! Couldn't go wrong with those! My boyfriend had onion rings and we swapped some fries and rings. Both were tasty!   The service was good and the meal was good, but I was hoping for spectacular."}
{"text":"Great local bar that has been a staple on lee rd for over 20 years! Nice local atmosphere and pretty good bar food. Beer and food prices are average for the area. A must stop on the lee rd. bar crawl."}
{"text":"Nice bartender in a dimly lit bar atmosphere with sticky floors that the juke box doesn't quite drown out. Burger isn't inedible but tastes like meat was frozen and not thawed before grilled, but not dry and the seasoning isn't bad. Soggy fries, but parmesan cheese on top. So some effort is there, maybe next time will be better! Nice overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"People \"in the know\" refer to it as \"Tav Co.\" Don't I sound elite? If only yelp would agree and bestow some elite love on me.   Anyways, they have a fun patio and a laid back vibe. Stop by Mondays and make it a date night ($5 movie at Cedar Lee and Monday specials at Tav Co.)"}
{"text":"Food's good. Drinks are cheap. On weekends there a lot of big tittie cougars on the prowl. Why would you go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"Super busy...could have used more help. Got the normally delicious burger and it was over done. I won't slay them this time because its normally great but wasn't my favorite visit."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. First two times immediate service. 3rd time, sat for 30 minutes, had a guy clean and straighten all around us, never once acknowledged us"}
{"text":"Formerly, in the historic Morehead Street Tavern, The Tavern is now open for business! I've been by a few times, including during the Grand Opening festivities and I'm so happy to say that the nostalgia has remained in tact. Sure, there have been updates made but overall, The Tavern remains a place that is comfortable, welcoming, and relaxed.  I've been pleasantly surprised with the menu, too. It's high quality food for a bar and has options for every person... From salads to good ole reuben's. My favorite is definitely the Jack Daniels Honey wings - Extremely flavorful and crispy. Also, the Collard Green dip was actually really good. It may not look like the most appetizing food, but really, it's fantastic.  Staff is great - They are well trained and very courteous.   A great place for some mid week drinks or a weekend party destination!"}
{"text":"Service was awful.  The bar tender was extremely rude.  No wonder this place was empty on a Saturday night.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas off the strip. Bar under construction and yet still some of the best service we have had! The chili lime wings and street tacos are fabulous. I wish I knew how to play darts because it looked so fun. Will absolutely be back the next time I fly to the West Coast!!!"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest restaurant in the city. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages, the menus were filthy and my glass had lipstick on it. The Cokes we ordered were nasty (we think the Cokes were at the end of the syrup container). The food was not the impressive either. The vegetable noodle soup didn't have vegetables in it, the quesadilla didn't have cheese on it. The salad and turkey chili were okay, but didn't blow our socks off. I don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Look.  I'm not writing this for the food.  It could be awesome, I don't know I have never tried it.  I like the feel of the Tavern on Tuesday night trivia night.  I have now been constant, and probably loser, or second loser about four times.  It is quite a fun little evening.  The bar tender (Sara?) is super nice and high spirited, they have good beers on tap, and the trivia is fun.  I had some fries once.  They were good.  I can't remember the name of the woman who runs the trivia, but its normally a pretty good crowed.  No one gets over the top, and it must have the Case crowd or at least some smarties because I do horribly every time.  It runs from 10 till midnight on Tuesdays.  So get you a team together, get you some beers, sit back, relax at the night before the hump, and make yourself feel dumb.  It works for me."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great place, great music, amazing food and lots of dart boards. Southern Style Chicken Tacos are soooo good. I could eat a dozen."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere, the staff, and the food are simply amazing! No matter what time of day you visit, you're in for a great time. Everything on the menu is phenomenal! So if you're looking for a great neighborhood bar where everyone knows your name, or just looking for some delicious eats, stop by The Tavern!"}
{"text":"Poor service. The server short hair white woman. When asked for menu, slam the menu on the table. Same thing with water and the food that we order. I thought she just have a heavy hands. We say thank you, still no response. I can understand that sometimes people just have a bad day. But when customer is polite, the least you can do is response.( I guess she did, rudely)..I hope she feel better now, because after all that treatment she had with us. We still gave her a good tip."}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was Salamandra back in the day and this place is Charlotte's best kept secret! Staff is awesome prices are decent and food is delicious !"}
{"text":"Ryan was very personable. Great atmosphere with all the TVs and pool table. All the staff was friendly. Prices good. Could of had more selection for finger food. No biggie though."}
{"text":"Nice chill spot .. great little happy hour menu & I like that they have two , during the day & at night from midnight until 2am .. I had some wings that weren't on the happy hour menu but they were amazing (Garlic Parmesan) and some chili cheese fries from the happy hour menu both were good and I recommend them .. I would go back to this place .. only downside is the night I went they had a live band and it was really loud so if you want to talk to the person/people your with that may be a little hard lol but it was enjoyable anyways .. I'm sure they don't have live bands every night anyways lol I went on the weekend .."}
{"text":"We just had the Tavern host our engagement party for 80 plus people which they catered and they even decorated the bar for us, it was awesome! The service was impeccable and the staff was amazing. The food they catered for our party was delicious, all our guests were so impressed by the food and service! Nick the kitchen manager and Chanel the bar manager made sure our party was taken care of the entire night! If you are having an event...have it at The Tavern!!!"}
{"text":"Great place employees are friendly great food and prices very reasonable. Have live music on Friday night. Very fun and friendly place. All newly remodeled"}
{"text":"Service is just awful. If you want bar food go to brennens colony."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to try new places. The Yelp reviews brought us in. We'd never been here before, but know it was a pretty dicey spot at one point. The Crow bar I think? We ordered the wing flight and the spicy pork tacos. The food was outstanding. Seriously good. Presentation was on point. It's super smoky inside, but it's a dive bar. Cool spot!"}
{"text":"Burger was delicious and service was outstanding as always. I enjoy this place soooooo much better than any PTs!! The air is not smokey and the atmosphere is much better too."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service, Ryan was our bartender and make my husband and i feel very welcome since we got there. Try your first drink for free if you check in. The food was amazing. I try the phily cheesse and let me tell you it was better than the classic spot in town. Nice friendly atmosphere for young crowds. Im so glad this location is now the tavern."}
{"text":"Wow.  Best chicken wings I have ever had and great service.  In town for the game?  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place looks like your average bar on the outside but it is more than that. The atmosphere is a cute and quaint. There's a large projector screen for the big game. But the reason I give it 5 stars is the food. It was bar food taken to the next level of delicious. Pulled pork Mac and cheese is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Great bar food across the menu. Nice newly renovated place. Went with some locals and they loved the gaming/pool table. Excellent customer service"}
{"text":"Wow! My wife and I went in tonight solely because of the reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed.   Let's be clear,  this is a bar and grill.  But the food offered is not your typical bar food. The menu has a really good variety. We ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and I ordered the chicken parm sandwich and my wife ordered the Philly cheese steak.  The food was great! We will no doubt go back when we have a chance.   The staff was nothing short of fantastic.  Our server was very attentive. I never had an empty beer in front of me.   Yes this place is a bit out of the way but we thought it was well worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to get a beer and burger on Lee Road in Cleveland Heights, but the thing is, it's not just a pub/burger joint.  You can take people here that want to eat such exotic fare as \"Spinach Salad\", \"Chicken\", or \"Mussels\".  Yes, this place does indeed have quite the selection.  The prices are decent, as well.  Disclaimer, I'm not 100% sure about the 4th star, but I have always had good results, so i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.  For now."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. The my ribeye was cooked perfectly. Employees super cool. The drinks were bomb and can't forget the chilli lime wings, yummy"}
{"text":"Wow, this neighborhood joint was packed for a Monday night. I came here for dinner with my cousins and we were immediately drawn to the $9 Monday night special - 1/4 burger with your choice of cheese (smoked gouda for me), fries/onion rings, and pint of beer/glass of wine.   What made me excited about this place was that they served Yuengling. I was somewhat surprised that I saw it on the board and the server told me that they just got a couple of months ago. I have only had Yuengling in the state of PA when I was in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. It's so hard to find it in other states.   Our meals itself were okay. We had to send our burgers back because they were undercooked. I do wish that our burger buns were toasted. I really did like the onion rings though.  Decent neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Tavern Co. today at about 1:30 for lunch. It's kind of dark and has weird decor (think Irish bar/hunting lodge), but the menu definitely looked tasty and the prices are reasonable for what seems like higher quality bar food.  We sat down in a very full dining room and our drink orders were taken right away. The waitress/bartender did tell us the kitchen was backed up and there would be a bit of a wait. That was probably the last time she visited our table for 40-45 minutes until our food arrived. Someone else ended up bringing us takeout boxes and our check.  We ordered a chopped wedge salad and a breakfast burrito. The food was good, but I was disappointed that my salad was served on a plate that felt like it just came out of the dishwasher. My salad quickly wilted and turned to liquid. There was also very little in the way of bacon. My husband's burrito was satisfying, but the homemade sausage needed some seasoning. The homefries were also a little undercooked.  Besides the long wait time, the slow service, and the warm salad plate, the other thing that was somewhat off-putting was a number of staff members were eating behind the bar and were served their lunch before the customers, even after the bar had emptied out and there were only a few tables left.  We might go back and check it out at a different time of day. We think they were short staffed and/or some of the staff were hung over because of St. Patrick's Day."}
{"text":"Although the fireplace and moose head on the wall give it a cool cabin feel, the new menu is pricey and too fancy for the bar setting.  Tav Co used to be a place for an over priced beer and above average bar food but they re-did their menu. Now it is over priced beer with an expensive snooty menu!  Veal, mussels, $21 pork chop!  A shared app, dinner and two drinks will cost you over $35/person for this tiny local bar.  Ok if that is what you are looking for."}
{"text":"First time for dinner.  Good selection of entrees from sandwiches to salads, flat breads, and  entrees.  Food came out quickly but was just ok in flavor.  Service was mediocre.  Server was unfriendly and only refilled drinks at the end. My Daughter's Mac and cheese was under cooked. It's sad when you can make better Mac n cheese from a box!"}
{"text":"traditional #happy hour munchies!  this place is inexpensive and delicious!  upon entering I was greeted by #awesome bartender Ginger! I selected a table with my lady friend and absorbed three dining area TVs, gaming, darts, pool table and Vegas Knights Decor! this set the mood for ordering appetizers!  chili cheese fries!  sliders! bbq chicken quesadillas!  omgoodness!  just when we thought it was over the chocolaty cookie dough egg roll was suggested!  good food! great prices! friendly staff! #awesome can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Can I say I love this place.  Tuesday nights are Too Funny Tuesday.  Local comedians and some known comedians perform.  The wait staff is great and the drinks are spectacular.  If you don't get a chance to eat before making it to the 8pm show, you can order from there.  The food is really good!  And it always seem to be a diverse group of folks!  I would definitely recommend heading out to this place on Tuesday nights.  I haven't been any other night but will give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ryan  is as an exceptional bartender. He knew exactly what he was doing. Great costumer service. This is my first time being here and I will definitely return.."}
{"text":"Last I was here things were more like Crowbar, which was good! Now it seems that \"The Tavern\" is now here. It's much brighter, button back chairs, new paint, & curtains to section off areas!? Staff is super attentive one you're on a bar stool, but after you're served good luck unless the barkeep wearing the Raiders jersey knows you. Wings? Wow. Not the same. I'd go as far as to say wings from a chain joint are better now. Yes, even baked wings from Pizza Hut. The flavor just isn't, well there. I think they're trying some sort of rub/sauce hybrid which we all know will only result it some sort of biological weapon that will bring humanity to it's knees, wait. Does Kim Jung own this joint now!? Regardless, I probably will never come back! Well if I can ever get my tab. I suppose I should end this with if I can ever leave!"}
{"text":"The tavern company is a pub that serves pretty standard bar food and has a wide selection of beers. We came to watch the cavaliers game (sadly the actual game is in California).   We had a very positive experience. I had a draft beer and macaroni and cheese, and my friends took advantage of a wings special. The food was delicious, and the environment was fun! Lots of cheering basketball fans (I was more of a bystander, admittedly)!   Our server was wonderful, and he offered to put all of our meals on different tabs with no prompting.   My only real complaint was some of the pricing; I don't believe that, anywhere, a salad should be more than $10, even with meat on it, and particularly in the Cleveland area.   Overall, this place is wonderful, and I look forward to visiting here again! We'll definitely be back, and I'm excited to see how the cavs do should they win tonight!"}
{"text":"I've been to hundreds of places to eat and drink (alcohol). Tav co is one of the best bars I've been to for both food and drink in the greater Cleveland area. The drinks are strong, the staff is friendly, and the food is the most delicious underrated part of the establishment. Rumor has it the owner doesn't use a freezer, all the food taste so fresh. Must go to place."}
{"text":"This place has been remolded, looks and feels just like its atmosphere energetic, lively with a bit of coziness!! The bartender Danielle was pretty Hot and knew her stuff, attentive and had many suggestions on tasty libations!! The staff were cool too and the live music tops it off!! This is going to be my new \"Go To Spot\"!!!"}
{"text":"Chris and the crew have picked up the torch from jb. This heights legend has a modified menu in addition to all the colony favorites. In the summer the patio is the best beer garden around. Great staff."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise with the new ownership of the bar the food is outstanding the Decour outstanding even the bathroom looks great and the service is outstanding I play darts there and now I look forward to going tothere and eating playing darts and having a cocktail it's not a shit hole anymore it's a great place to go I highly recommend this place and what great people that work there"}
{"text":"My best friend introduced this place to me and so grateful she did. Excellent service. Good Food and Good Serving for the price. Main thing I will say: COOKIE DOUGH EGGROLL. It was the most awesome creation of food I have ever had and did not regret the sugar crash later."}
{"text":"Just went to Tavco and ordered 5 chicken wings with a sides of mac and cheese and cole slaw.  $20!!!  Overpriced for what it is.  The cole slaw was good, sweet and crunchy the way I like it.  The wings were good, small but well-cooked.  What bothered me was the NINE DOLLAR charge for 5 wings.  It was explained that the only way I could order less than twelve wings was to order the \"kids meal\"  with 5 wings and fries (which I didn't want) for $9---a rip-off for kids and grown-ups alike.  But the real heart-breaker was the mac and cheese.  It was plentiful for a slightly pricy $7.  But on examination, it was stark white.  No sign of any cheese mixed in.  Okay, maybe they use some kind of white cheese?  Think again.  Not even a little cheesy.  It was literally like someone made the roux and completely forgot to melt in the cheese.  Like macaroni mixed with salted library paste.  Really, Tavco?  On the plus side, service was good.  But just not worth the price, sadly."}
{"text":"This place was so great! You walk in and feel at home!! The food was amazing! The head chef came out and just hung out with us. My order was off and they made me a whole other meal. With no charge! They were so kind even with us having a big group! I will definitely come back on the regular."}
{"text":"TavCo used to be the place to go for those \"too good to be true\" specials that actually were true. It was the kind of place that you would think, \"this can only exist in Cleveland.\" Then the ownership changed. At first I was promised that the new owner would keep everything the same. How many times has that been said when a bar changed ownership?  TavCo has attempted to go upscale. Once the kitchen renovation was complete a new menu appeared with the now popular \"upscale pub\" fare. Meh. I never wished TavCo would change. I liked it exactly the way it always was. Now I don't feel excited about the prospect of going here anymore. It's not like I won't pop in occasionally or suggest it as a meeting place for a quick drink, but it's not the place it used to be."}
{"text":"Went to the new location the other night and was so disappointed. The Colony had slipped since the incident understandable. I was super hopeful for TavCo moving in. Unfortunately, it was dirty, mixed with poor service. I will likely give them a chance but super disappointed so far."}
{"text":"If you would like to come in and have great drinks with friendly bartenders this is the place to come.  It was my first visit here and will not be my last.  The place is very clean and the time we visited was cold enough to snow in there.  We were immediately greeted by Ginger and cheered our play while playing video poker.  She was replaced later by Ryan, who was also very attentive.  I have to admit for a Vegas bar, this is one of the best.  I am from Los Angeles, visit Vegas about once a month but will make this place a stopping place.  They have darts, pool tables, video machines and great service!  If your in the area you need to check this place out..."}
{"text":"Pulled pork Mac-n-cheese.  Go. Now. Truly one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten.  Love these dive type places!"}
{"text":"Perfect for a casual night on the patio. I kind of like that it is crowded! Food is about what you would expect but the service is really fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Kaleb makes the best drinks on off the strip, no idea we still had mixologists in vegas,  let alone local celebrities! come down if you want the something to experience"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a decade.  We came when it was Brennan's Colony.  Now it's The Tavern or Tavern Co.    We just had the most insulting service by the owner who told us if we didn't like the service, we could go to McDonald's.   Either they don't like an long time customer who has always played and tipped well or the new owner is a total asshole.  I think the latter.  Food is marginal, expensive and the service is obviously, now terrible."}
{"text":"Food is only okay, overpriced and portion sizes are tiny. Service is terrible and extremely slow.   I had the veal meatloaf with mashed potatoes. About a playing card sized bit of meat resting on maybe 3/4 cup of mashed potatoes. Two of the thinnest pieces of asparagus I have ever seen. This was supposed to come with salad but never received. Our server dropped off the food and disappeared for a long time so there was no real opportunity to ask about it until everyone else was done eating.  In addition, I get that this is supposed to be some kind of Cleveland Hts institution. But it felt like hanging out in someone's grubby basement. This was underscored by the state of the bathrooms which were nastier than a truck stop. We can only hope that the men's bathroom is actually clean and the kitchen staff was male."}
{"text":"Love love love. Great atmosphere for a local spot. I have had a variety of food from here and haven't been disappointed yet. Definitely a local spot so if you're expecting cloth napkins and waiters named Jeeves this isn't your place. I recommend the wings most definitely."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, bar tenders, and cooks. Very polite service. The Nachos are so yummy! Great wine and excellent prices!"}
{"text":"It's usually good. But I asked for no croutons on my salad because I have a gluten allergy and they put croutons on there. I didn't have time to come back because I was on my lunch break. So I was a little disappointed . Maybe I'll give it another try at a later date."}
{"text":"I like Tav Co. The beer, alcohol and liquid selection is pretty good here. The food is above average pub fare.  My favorite dishes on the menu include their brisket burger (hearty, flavorful and unctuous) and the flatbread with figs and goat cheese (special, light-ish and balanced). Their different aioli options are nice ways to perk up your fries and onions rings.  One thing that bothers me is the constant smell. In addition to their male restroom always appearing unattended, their main dining room often has a faint smell of urine and sewage. It's unsettling and once, my friends and I left because the smell was too overwhelming.  Also, we tried using the check-in offer for a free bottle of wine and were told by the staff this was not an agreement with Yelp. They had no clue the offer was being run (and still is as of today!)."}
{"text":"Decided to check this spot out after Crowbar closed. I'm V E R Y impressed! The bartender Josh is absolutely A W E S O M E! The food was great! I got the chili lime wings with the pulled pork street tacos and I would get them again! I will be telling my friends about it and be a regular!"}
{"text":"The Tavern on Morehead is the best kept secret in Uptown and I don't know why.  Great staff, very attentive.  My friend is a nacho connoisseur voted them the best in Uptown.  Beers very cold and a great crew watching the Pathers game. Would have given them a five but feel that rating should be for ultimate performance. Which they did for the Tavern hang out and watch the game award however that is not a catagory on Yelp .  Will be back."}
{"text":"Solid brunch. Super slow service. It seemed like there was only one server when we were there on Father's Day, and she was doing a pretty good job, all things considered."}
{"text":"Monday Night Fotball: great food, especially the Chocolate chip cookie dough eggroll.!"}
{"text":"We haven't eaten here in a while. Big mistake. The food and service were above and beyond. My husband had the cod sandwich. I took a bite and wished I ordered that...until I had a bite of my steak salad. I know.. A steak salad, but it was SO good. Anyhow, I can't wait to get back here again soon. Don't miss this:  a bar with exquisite food. Perfection with great cocktails."}
{"text":"We actually found this place on Yelp and had friends meet us there. It had a sign that said to excuse their dust."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Good food, good prices, bartenders and even the cooks are all super cool and friendly. I've been here so far twice in the past couple of weeks. This is on my friends side of town so, when we hang out this is our new go-to spot! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This bar was THE CROW bar prior, and my have the changed this dive up! Talk about renovations they did it all...As it is still in progress it looks amazing. Perfect spot and ample parking! This place is easily my new favorite waterhole. They have pool, darts, and over 10 tv's in the place with a lounging area with leather couches and all. The new food menu is amazing! Once all renovations are done this place will for sure be the spot to be for locals!"}
{"text":"I am currently sitting on Tav CO's patio watching the cavs game and all is well in the world.  Service is excellent, atmosphere is hoppin (but not obnoxious) and beer variety is just what the doctor ordered. Oh, and we've got a plate of perfectly seasoned and fresh cut French fries in front of us.  Do yourself a favor and head over to this patio. It's a hidden gem in Cleveland heights.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Amazing service.   Nick is amazing.  He has a hidden menu.  Always bring friends.  Way better than freemont bars.   Food is one of the best."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I absolutely love the service here, the bartenders are friendly and introduce themselves to you. The attentiveness they give you while you're here is great. I found this place through Yelp reviews and I'm so glad we did. The food is really really GOOD, and to top it off the live music is great. Found my new favorite bar..  just wish the parking lot a was a bit brighter late night when leaving."}
{"text":"Something about this place really jived with me. We came on a Friday, they have live music on Friday's (from what I can tell), the crowd was diverse, younger, older, etc....the waitresses were great, bartenders attentive, they pour one of our favorite Irish whiskeys Tullamore Dew. Good stuff. We didn't eat here so can't review the food, but overall it was a pretty cool find."}
{"text":"They claim to be a Washington Redskins bar, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. However, they show all games, and when I asked the barmaid to switch a TV to the Redskins, she would not. Since I came for Redskins football, I did not stay, so I can't rate the food. Service was non-existent. REDSKINS FANS STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Went here the other night because Yelp reviews were good.  Yelp was right again.  We sat at the bar and had fast, good service.  Without my asking, our bartender brought me a taste of a beer kinda like the one I had and thought I might like, very cool.  We ordered quite a bit off the menu and the food came out looking great, and it tasted that way too.  The pork tacos were my favorite.  The pork sliders were also really good and all 3 flavors on the wing flight hit the spot.  The staff even had the pool table opened up so we got that for free...and some guy bought everyone in the bar a shot.  Great night, will be back."}
{"text":"I go here all the time, mainly just to watch some football and have a nice meal.  It's a dive/sports bar - with better food.  I always recommend their salmon row salad.  It is phenomenal.  Their burgers are quite good as well, and the fries are great.  I've even picked up food from here on occasion and been very happy with their take-out as well.   Just like most sports bars, they have a number of TVs in the bar area and a well-stocked bar.  The bar area is spacious, and although there is usually a good amount of people there when I go, there is usually a few spots at the bar and a table or two open as well. I absolutely recommend Tavern Co. if you're interested in a nice bar to grab a Great Lakes draught, watch some football, and have a really great meal."}
{"text":"Love this place.. food is delish!! Always have laughs with the Bartenders when we visit."}
{"text":"12.00 for two tiny bacardi and cokes no alcohol  in them at all. Waited an hour to get a drink just so it could be in a 8oz high ball glass packed with so much ice it was a 3oz drink. Why bother. Nice looking over priced drinks, over priced food. Nursing home crowd"}
{"text":"I really, really want to dig this place, but every time I've been here with a group (around four people or so), the service was slower than New Edition's excellent slow jams. Also, when we asked to have seperate checks, the server looked at us like we told her we stabbed her mother. I would understand, but generally the process of splitting checks is criminally easy.  Regardless, the food and beer selection is good, and there certainly are worse things than sitting outside on a cool summer night while slowly getting drunk with friends."}
{"text":"Tav Co is definitely a dive bar but they are a hidden gem if you've never been. The food is delicious!! It's unique bar food. We had the prosciutto flatbread, calamari and breaded provolone.  The flatbread is just amazing! The calamari is a little sweet in the sweet chili sauce. It was very good but I'm not sure I'd get it again. I just prefer a garlic seasoned calamari with marinara. The breaded provolone is great too! My husband also had the soft shell crab po' boy which he loved! I tried the fries and they were so good.  Food and drinks are reasonably priced. There is a kids menu so we will go back with our little ones!"}
{"text":"I really like the new TavCo - best of the Colony and Tavern Company in one place.  They had some issues when they first opened with service, but that has all gone away.  We went there for one of the World Series games and had a great time with some friends.  Beer was cold, food was good and service was quick even though there was a big crowd.  Glad to see this neighborhood joint is continuing - looking forward to many more beers with my buddies there."}
{"text":"Fancy food meets standard pub decor?  I had the opportunity to stop by TavCo, as it's known by the locals, with a large group of friends after our dinner location of choice (ahem, Colony) was packed.  Our server did an excellent job taking care of my double digit party, and we weren't without food or drinks for very long.  What seemed interesting to me was that the food seemed classier than what you'd expect for a neighborhood bar.  And not that it's a bad thing for a neighborhood bar to have above average food, but the way TavCo looks, I wouldn't  expect to be a little on the pricey side.  There are only a couple vegetarian options on the menu.  I got one of them - a portabella wrap.  It tasted ok but was comically small.  (are you calling me fat, TavCo?)  I wished I'd gotten the butternut squash soup special that one of my friends got.  Or some of the garlicky smelling fries another friend got.  Or probably just about anything else.  Oh well.  I'd definitely go back to TavCo to try out some more of their fancy eats or for a drink or five."}
{"text":"My first time here and Ryan was absolutely amazing! He was so friendly and took such great care of us! . Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We went in for a bite to eat and I was pleasantly surprised.  The decor is really nice inside, crystal chandeliers, leather seats and such. There is a huge big screen tv off to the side.  The vibe inside was cool, and the music was loud. No complaints from me! Football was on at the time we were there. My friend ordered Chicken fingers , and I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Fries (w/no cheese sauce). They were excellent. Enough for at least two people. I thought it was really nice that the cook came out and asked how everything was. I could tell that he takes pride in his work. Anyways the food is great and we will be going back. Our sever was nice as well :)"}
{"text":"Great staff, awesome specials, and fun weekly events! Loving the live music and Trivia here gets wild!"}
{"text":"This place takes \"dive bar\" to a whole new level. The quiet location mixed with a borderline gourmet menu makes for an awesome overall bar experience. Add in an awesome friendly staff with online dart boards, pool table, and golden tee makes this place easily one of or if not the best off the strip hidden bars in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this bar! Great staff, cold dranks and delicious food. The chili lime, hotiyaki and miso sesame wings are to die for. The spicy pork tacos are also awesome if you like spicy food! There's a ton of dart boards, a pool table and even a beer pong table! Looking forward to seeing the renovations they do and to having my bday party there soon!  They keep ciders and Stella cidre in stock which is nice since I have a friend with celiacs!"}
{"text":"Problem with this place is the service. They are under staffed and you wait FOREVER for EVERYTHING! Although the staff is courteous, it takes away from the possible wonderful experience. You never want to hear the chef say to the manager, \" People are missing food\"... it's truly sad because this place has so much potential of being great!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a local bar nearby that serves GREAT food! So far we have only had the pulled pork tacos, fries, and pizza but it has all been really good. I could truly eat the pizza at least once a week... I also hear the wings are really good. You can really see the sense of pride in the new owners. the owners son is in charge of the kitchen and he is doing an amazing job with quality ingredients. We also had a chance to meet the owner who is plugging a lot of money into the place to clean it up and fancy it up a bit. He was very nice and bought us a shot of his favorite whiskey, which was a nice touch, making us feel welcome. We have also had interactions with 2 bartenders; josh and Caleb ( I think was his name)...both were fun and totally engaging, which makes losing on the machines a little less painful! Overall we are so pleased, and now we are just waiting and hoping... please stay this way! Stay consistent and we will be loyal!!"}
{"text":"Had a great steak dinner last night at The Tavern!  We had a choice of filet or rib eye each meal with green beans, huge baked potato . Last night our filet had a yummy mushroom gravy ..DELICIOUS.    Everyone there are so nice and helpful..great food, drinks, big sports fans..please go...a nice local place.."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The service is beyond phenomenal!! The owner is very personable and the server was beyond super!! Now, the food: all I can say is.. Wow!! The calamari was excellent, the hamburgers are beyond great, oooh, the polenta!!! I'm Sicilian, and I had to almost swear my mother was in the kitchen!! It was that close!!!"}
{"text":"TavCo is a good, unpretentious neighborhood joint with a really solid, interesting menu. The bartenders are friendly and easygoing. At mealtimes it's generally very easy to get a seat. And it's quiet, too!   Check out the burger, the flatbreads, and their Sunday brunch. All of which are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"TavCo has a popular patio in the summer and a couple of warm seats in the winter.   Note that the \"turkey burger\" is neither turkey nor burger.  It's a grilled chicken breast.  Good, just odd."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and excellent service.   We also went on a Monday night which was filled with regulars for Pub Quiz Night.   We stuck around for some trivia as well, and it was fun!  Prices are good and their happy hour is til 7; longer than most!   We will be back."}
{"text":"The pulled pork tacos are so bomb.. actually anything featuring the pulled pork is delicious. The chocolate chip cookie dough egg rolls are my favorite! They are so gooey. Def a must if you like chocolate. They have pool, poker and DartsLive. The barstaff is always friendly and attentive. The cooks are super nice as well."}
{"text":"Wow what an unexpected surprise! I told my mom about this place and she kind of looked at the place weird from the outside kind of like \"ummm where are you taking me?!\" But I told her don't fear it's got great reviews! Lol definitely all the rave :) The inside is quite inviting for a bar! I love it and the staff was so nice and friendly!   As locals we just wanted a nice lunch to enjoy outside of the strip. I'm glad we found this place! Golden Knights Fans + Pool + Darts + Great burgers!? Why wouldn't you come here???   My mom and I had some bomb burgers and the pickles came sliced on the side which I thought was great because I'm allergic to pickles anyway but it's nice they give that option! I had an Always Sunny burger with an egg on top and the bacon was CRISPY!!!! I LOVE CRISPY ASS BACON!!! :D we also had the dessert too....omg cookie dough goodness. The happy hour was reasonable too....  Obviously were not coming back anytime soon (insert sarcasm lol) if you're looking for a great local bar just to enjoy a nice lunch or maybe even catch some games....this is the place to go....  Also, the ladies room was so nice!!! Usually bar restrooms are meh...but this was well taken care of and pretty nice!   Come on by this place!"}
{"text":"I go to the Tavern Company 3 or 4 times per month.  For a while I lived around the corder and I walked there every couple of days for a beer or two.    To me, and to many who walk into the TavCo, it is THE place to go on Lee Road when you want a drink with friendly faces and a really nice, reasonably priced meal.    Great beer, wonderful staff, wonderful service, outdoor seating and NO attitude.  Go - it's a wonderful, locally owned and operated place."}
{"text":"The Grand-Reopening was a blast!! Food is very good, a twist on bar fav's. BF had steak wrap, and he ate it all very quickly. I had chicken parm sandwich, yummy! The decor is fancy, lighting very nice, and the ceiling was gorgeous. Not your usual video poker bar. Great place to meet up with friends! Definitely gonna be here for football season."}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly staff. I dont drink but the beer prices seems cheap. I went there at 6:30 on a friday - deep into happy hour. You'd think the place would be packed with happy hour drunks. QUITE the opposite - it was PACKED WITH RUG RATS. it was like every person on earth has 3 toddlers and they were out dining on a friday night. So there's the welcoming families thing.Next the food. Well I was in the mood for a nice steak  - unfortunately I picked the wrong place on Lee for that. DO NOT GET THE HANGER STEAK. They charged me $25 bucks for this thing and it was a WTF Steak. I was warned it was not a bone in steak and just 10 ounces. well I think I got jipped 2 or 3 ounces and charged about 7 or 8 bucks too much. It was good, not great but good. DId I mention they charged me 25 BUCKS for this thing?? I loved their bread budding. That was great. Will I go back? hard to say. Definately NOT too early - dont care for rug rats. and Im definately sticking to burgers from the menu if I do."}
{"text":"This place deserves some Yelp lovin'.    First of all, space is huge.  The main room looks like your average feel-good bar, but then to the right, there is a massive room with pool tables, plenty of seating, and a couple of TVs.  It hasn't been too busy on Monday evenings, so our alumni board meetings are held there.    The employees are friendly and very hospitable - they are nice enough to throw our tables together, take a bunch of separate orders, and turn down the music for us to discuss amongst ourselves. The back room has been fairly vacant, but that's awfully nice of them.  It looks like its owner-operated because the peeps look like they are putting in A+ effort.  I ordered the Healthy Trim, which is fresh fruits, cottage cheese, and grilled chicken.  Oh, and a beer to balance out all the vitamin C and lean protein.  The fruits and cheese was average, but the grilled chicken tasted really good.  I mean, I don't know what it was but it just hit the spot!  Lightly seasoned and juicy.  Craved cottage cheese, but grilled chicken satisfied.  (Cottage cheese cravings - it's a real thing.)  Couple of parting tips:  TIP #1:  It's kinda tough to spot if you're driving by so just make a right as if you're going to the Time Warner Cable building there (you know, where you return all your TWC gear after you've been fed up with them).  Parking is... easy.  TIP #2:  Look down when you walk into the big room on the right.  There's a subtle  step before entering.  If you fall victim to it, you might as well leave without ordering anything off their menu.  After all, you just ATE IT, BIG TIME!    dmo out"}
{"text":"Went to The Tavern Co on a Saturday night. The bar was packed but was able to get a table for four right away. I had the homemade veggie burger, not bad. Next time I want to try the portabella caprese wrap. The service was fine, the waitress was friendly. If you're in the Cleveland Heights area, check it out."}

{"text":"Fun staff and amazing food! If you check in you get a free drink of your choice which is awesome! Pool tables, dart boards, beer pong! They are doing construction and their new floors and counters are beautiful. The miso sesame wings, hotiyaki and chili lime wings are delicious. My daughter and husband die over the spicy pork tacos. We came here for super bowl and it was a blast!"}
{"text":"My friends, wife and I decided to try a new place.  I've driven by this bar 1000k times and we decided to come here to eat, watch nfl/nhl and play some video poker.    What a great choice.  We really enjoyed our time here and had some great food and beverages while watching the games.    We had some great beers, pizza, wings, burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I was coming to this place when it was the old crowbar. TOTALLY run down, new owners came in and renovated and now the place looks amazing! Great staff, Caleb and Josh are my favorites! The chili lime wings are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Went to their new location last night where Brennan's use to be. Prices weren't consistent. 4 of us got vodka red bulls- 4 different prices, ranging from $4.50-$9. When we asked about the $9 red bull, the server argued with us saying that the person who rang up the $4.50s was wrong. Felt uncomfortable after that."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Ginger is a great bartender. Appetizers were very good. Nice atmosphere, with plenty of activities to chose from. I would highly recommend a visit"}
{"text":"Well, since this place changed ownership a year or so ago, they've tried to \"upgrade\" their food. So the famed $5 burger night has been replaced by a $9 burger night. But, honestly, the food seems to be missing something... some extra spark or flavor that brings the dish together and makes it stand out. I've been there for Sunday brunch, as well, and, while the dishes sound fantastic & fancy (with items containing goat cheese & braised pork), they were not that impressive. Given the effort & ingredients that they seem to be putting into their dishes, I expect something more from them.  On the positive side, they've got a decent set of beers on draft, and the servers are congenial. You can usually catch the owner there behind the bar (he got his start working at Brennan's across the streeet!)"}
{"text":"My partner and I love the new TavCo. The menu has plenty of offerings that venture beyond traditional \"bar food\". We are both food snobs, and are usually less than impressed by most bar menus, but this place has won us over.   Time after time we show up and are excited about the specials... Last night we both had a cream of asparagus soup that was absolutely decadent. I had a garden burger that has me craving one today, and my partner had a delicious red pesto and gouda chicken sandwich that was perfectly seasoned and moist.   P.S. the tavern fries are my new favorite local fries.  We would highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a super casual environment with a well crafted menu."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. I went on a Wednesday night. Wasn't too busy, but very friendly staff, open areas, great alcohol selection and the pool tables were free."}
{"text":"Great service.  Very good food.  Nice outdoor area.    Full disclosure - I've never eaten inside the bar.  We usually get a table in their outdoor seating area, which is standard outdoor seating with lights and wrought iron table/chairs.  The inside bar/seating area has a funny odor that I'm not a huge fan of, although I do like the mounted game heads over the bar.    The food is very good for a gastropub - fish and chips, wings and flatbreads are very good.  The service outside is always very good, too.  My GF and I are regulars here.  We'll see how we like it when it gets cold out and the outdoor seating disappears."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar with consistent and quality food.  The owners care about their customers and neighbors.  The specials are always great and the standard menu is solid and thoughtfully prepared. The atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. Patio is average sized but well decorated. Can be a good wait for dinner on Friday and Saturday.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place is one of best places you can get food  that's actually good.  Everything I tried on the menu had pleased my pallet, I have not been disappointed. They have some best burgers around!!! So if you are close by give it a try, trust me."}
{"text":"TavCo is a solid pick for the Cedar Lee neighborhood. As far a bar food goes, they are pretty solid. I usually go with the BDG, due to my love of food with fried eggs on top, but most everything I've had is pretty good. The service is fine, but nothing to write home about. The beer selection is sound and the drinks are pretty stiff. I wouldn't say they are a destination spot, but if you live close they are worth a visit from time to time."}
{"text":"I was invited here by my friend for a line dancing event.  We were downstairs, which featured a large dance floor.  By the way, I love this  old building.  I knew it when it was The Cellar.  Quite a sprawling labyrinth of nooks and crannies. Our drink orders were taken promptly.  Their menu is simple, but few choices make for an easier selection.  I ordered the cheese and jalapeño quesadillas.  Our server brought me  quesadillas  with chicken.  Glad that I quickly noticed this and caught the server before she floated away.  The quesadillas were pretty good, although they could have been cooked a little longer.  Cheese needed melting.   But, it was a great night, and it is good that this old building still stands without Charlotte taking a whack at it like they do other historic properties.  I am hoping that my belly dance troupe leader will host her next hafla here!"}
{"text":"The few times that I have been here, I really enjoyed the food. The drink selection is not too extensive and the food menu is small. The atmosphere makes up for these shortfalls. The burgers are really good. The salads also are always fresh and use baby greens for the smaller side salad. The service is usually ok. This is just a nice neighborhood place to grab food and drinks without making a huge production out of it. If I lived closer, I probably would be here more often."}
{"text":"Went there last night to watch World Series. Were crowded inside and out. Had a hard time ordering a beer twice standing at the bar. Was never asked if I could be helped. I had to grab their attention. No thank you after paying. Was told we could not get food in back room but others had gotten food. Reluctantly agreed to let us place a food order. Terrible attitude by everyone behind bar except woman there. Have been frequenting Tavco and Colony for many years. Live close by. I let owner know how badly we were treated and he was totally unsympathetic. Tried to tell me it was because of World Series. Did he not think they would be crowded? Why have back room open if they couldn't provide service? Understaffed? Why on a World Series night? Will never go again and will share my experience with everyone I know. Rather spend my money where it is appreciated."}
{"text":"My gf and I went to see our favorite local band, The Benders and since it was our first time going we were a little apprehensive but there was no reason! The pizza was the best we ever had, my gf and I ordered a large supreme pizza, mozzarella sticks, Diet Coke and their bucket of 5 draft beers and our total bill was only $35!?!? So affordable and we'd gladly paid more because of the wonderful quality of the pizza. We paid $50 the extra was a tip because our waitress was literally AWESOME and their whole staff was so friendly and kind! The Benders brought it as always! Great night, thank you so much to everyone at The Tavern for creating such a great spot!"}
{"text":"Hi there, I loved this bar it was clean and super yummy food. Jessica the bartender was very polite and we had a great conversation about Hawaii and how that city works. It was very enlightening to hear those experiences with the island. Can't wait to take my friend Baylee"}
{"text":"Very good and respectable pub fare. We went a bit late 9:15, so the restaurant was becoming more bar.   However, the wings were great, the mozzarella squares were obviously made in-house and we can't wait to go for brunch sit on their awesome patio or order a burger!"}
{"text":"This place is my personal favorite. The food is great, drinks are strong, bartenders are above average (that is putting it mildy), music is always something you will like, they have live music rather often and now karaoke. It doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Recommended by Cody @ Ted Weins.  Great food & Kara was super! Thank you. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love the vibe in here. Caleb, our bartender/waiter, is super dope; very friendly and seems to enjoy working here.   I ordered the All American burger....listen, this burger tho!!!!!! Will most definitely be back. Can't wait to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Love the food. Terrible and rude service. I've been to tavco approx 50 times, often for brunch, but I will not be going back. Several times I have shown up at 11:10 (the opening time is posted on the door as 11 and on the web as 10:45) only to be rudely told that they are not open yet. I mentioned that the sign is incorrect and both times the male bartenders (amazingly there were 2 rude bartenders) said \"well were not open now\". This wasn't an isolated incident either. The service has been consistently rude, inattentive and poor almost every time I am there. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the food is so good."}
{"text":"Worst service!   Waited almost an hour for food and never received it.  Finally asked for refund after tired of waiting.  Waitress was completely unsympathetic.  Never going back!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here after dinner for a drink.  It seems like a great neighborhood bar to hang out and relax!!"}
