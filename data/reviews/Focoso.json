{"text":"Im a retired Chef. Im also a serious Pizza lover. My daughter and I are always on the quest for the perfect pizza. We all know that there are so many different styles. If you want the wood Fired. This is a Truck you can follow. We will! We though we had found the best in San Diego. But this actually rivals. Im very glad. Because I don't have to drive to SD every time I want awesome Wood Fired Pizza!! Its REALLY good."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Such an interesting concept. Highly recommend Focoso if you're up for some amazing pizza."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Focoso pizza wood fired pizza gourmet food truck! Tried many different kinds of their unique and all fresh ingredient pizzas, and I loved them all. You can even create your own specialty pizza! This is a must try when in the Phoenix area. Better than any delivery service and pizzas are made to order fresh and fast. Amazing and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Goodness. This is the best wood fired pizza I've ever had and the best food truck food as well. 

I will seek this out at any event I am out."}
{"text":"Love the wood brick oven pizza. thin crispy and very fresh ingredient.

Customer service is great , I just love the pizza crust"}
{"text":"We had Focoso's food truck at our company's Christmas party and everyone LOVED the pizzas!  The truck has an amazing giant wood-fired oven right inside and they whipped up make-your-own pizzas or their signature spicy Focosita pizza, which was ridiculously tasty!  Delicious crust was perfectly crispy and charred from the oven.  I would highly recommend them for private parties and will gobble up another pizza the next time I see them around town."}
{"text":"Really good pizza from a food truck? Yep. Not epic but good."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. The best I've had in a while. Also reasonably priced. $11 for a 3 topping pie."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best pizza food trucks I've ever had! I love how you can create your own from a list of awesome ingredients (pepperoni, feta, onions, jalape√±os, to name a few!). Everything tastes extremely fresh, which is what sold me. :) We talked with the owner a bit and you can tell she is extremely passionate about high quality, fresh ingredients and not leaving an environmental impact. It was a great pizza (well of course, since I designed it!) and I hope they come back soon!!"}
{"text":"Well pizza is pizza and in my book it is always good. I especially like the wood fired neapolitan style pizzas and so the different options on Focoso's menu had me expecting a really awesome meal. After a bit of a wait, what I ended up with was soggy pizza from a truck. Don't get me wrong, the flavors were great and you can tell that they definitely use high quality ingredients. It just wasn't cooked all the way and didn't have the crispy crust that I was hoping for. It might just have been because they were so backed up. I will probably give them another try in the future."}
{"text":"Very good pizza AWSOME owners who care about their customers !!! 
We ordered 2 pizzas and being that they are brick oven cooked a little dark underneath is to be expected - well my 4yr old and 5 yr old was not happy and not eating. The owner very kindly offered to make them another pizza without the dark bottom. Thank God he did because it was a home run for my 2 kids esp my 5 yr old daughter. We look for them every Wed night in old town Gilbert. We miss you guys and cant wait for you to come back. We LOVE your fresh pizza and kind conversations. God Bless you guys and hope to see you in Gilbert real soon!!! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I am so happy I got a whole pizza from Focoso at the Local First event this past weekend... they were doing samples, but the husband and I wanted a whole pie. This was certainly the best pizza we have had out of a truck (and a great pizza in general). All pizzas are based on a margherita (so they have fresh mozz and basil) for 8$ and toppings are 1$ each. We had a pepperoni and it was pretty glorious. The pizza came out piping hot, with that nice somewhat blackened bottom on the crust... yum. They offer real parm to put on (none of that weird granulated stuff), which added a nice flavor as well. The crust was just crunchy/chewy enough, not overly crunchy or chewy and definitely not soggy. The tomato sauce was legit. Overall, it was a delicious pizza. I would seek this truck out, and you should too."}
