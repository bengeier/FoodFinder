{"text":"Milky Way is our favorite vegetarian spot in Pittsburgh. It does have a cafeteria-style feel and it can get busy on Thursdays and Sundays, but you can't do better if you're looking for American-style food. 

The sandwiches, paninis, and hoagies are all consistently great, and you don't miss the meat. They have good falafel and fake chicken with plenty of texture and flavor. They also have great milkshakes and sides. The sweet potato fries and its \"secret\" sauce is a favorite, with a nice crunch and a good mix of tangy and sweet. And the salad bar is the best! You get a wide range of vegetables, cheese, and dressings, and the salads are large enough to feed two or three. 

If you're looking for vegetarian-friendly comfort food or a good salad, then this is the place to go. It's also worth trying if you're not vegetarian or keeping kosher, if just to see what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Go here at least once a week on average.  Great people, great food!
Favorites are the tuna melt, and salad bar."}
{"text":"I rarely leave reviews on Yelp but the service at Milky Way makes me want to go on a freakin' reviewing crusade. The food was fine, the place was clean, etc., but the young red-haired girl who took our order completely killed the experience for me and my family. She spoke to us like we had learning disabilities, made faces like we were speaking in tongues, and was just generally so completely in-your-face disrespectful that I was prepared to walk out and I really wish I could rewind time so I could do just do that. 

She actually twisted up her face in a \"wtf\" mask when she didn't understand what my boyfriend was ordering on his calzone, and I will never be able to unsee her blatant disrespect. I had to physically point at the  menu when I ordered my wrap on whole wheat because she gave me a blank look like
I was making shit up.

Again, food was fine but nothing mind-blowing. If it hadn't been for that girl's rude demeanor, I wouldn't even be wasting my time on this review. 

There was another guy working and he was very pleasant. If he had taken our orders, this would be a very different review. If you're really in the mood for a good vegetarian meal with delightful service, go to Zenith instead."}
{"text":"We had the fake meatball sandwich and \"chicken\" sandwich. Loved the fries! I'm not sure if this is typical, but the meatball sandwich was cold in certain spots in the sandwich and since the other sandwich took awhile to make, I saw our fries sit out on the counter for awhile. I *love* hot fries! But by the time we got them, they were warm. Still good, but I would've preferred they just gave us the fries ASAP and they served the sandwiches separately anyways. I would go back to eat the fries ; would get a different sandwich- many other options."}
{"text":"After a long day, we decended on Milky Way in a party if ten, with half a dozen children. The staff were welcoming and helpful. The food was hot and fresh. Even the pizza was good and I am not a huge fan.  We had falafel in different forms, very good, esp. the green hot sauce!!!  And some kid friendly stand bys like pizza and fries- which some places get lax on. Not here though. Hot, fresh, and tasty!! And BEST of all Kosher."}
{"text":"Not great, its an ok pizza shop I guess. Their quite expensive tho. Foods not amazing."}
{"text":"Love their eggplant pizza! Awesome salad bar. You can get as many add ins for your salad as you want! Comfortable environment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a casual place that has excellent pizza by the slice. You can order a whole pizza as well. They have tons of different kinds of pizza, and I really liked the crust. It's kosher (as in Orthodox dairy kosher), which is a big plus. They have salads, soft serve, panini's, and some entrées as well. Customer service is decent. There is a large seating area, but again it's very casual. Great place for lunch. I would recommend going!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Never had kosher pizza until a pharmaceutical representative brought it to our office. Food tasted great!"}
{"text":"On a quest for the best tuna melt sandwich? Look no further. I have tried them far and wide, and this is the one. It's a little pricey for a tuna melt (at around 10 dollars), but with the Israeli salad and the melted cheese and perfectly toasted bread, I keep coming back for it. You will too.

It is a kosher place, so if you want to get your tuna melt in on a Friday, it will have to be at lunch time, which is the ideal tuna melt time anyway.

I had the calzone once and it was also delicious, but otherwise I have not gotten around to trying anything else, yet. Just need to find the willpower to resist the tuna once I am there."}
{"text":"Falafel was just ok. One of cooks dropped his giant rolling pin and then just put it back on his work surface"}
{"text":"worse experience i have ever encountered!!! if you want to meet some racists, come here! rude, rude, rude!!! i will never come here again!"}
{"text":"Big disappointment.  My coworker and I were in from out of town.  When I spotted this place I dragged him there since he never had falafel,  food that I grew up on in Israel. If he were to base his opinion on his experience here, he will never try it again.  We had the falafel platter. The falafel balls were extremely small, hard and almost tasteless. The hummus and tahina were equally disappointing.   The pita was ok.  Unless you need to eat at a place with kosher supervision don't even try Milky Way."}
{"text":"This kosher pizza is comparable to NY pizza! It was surprisingly amazing! The dough was especially delicious. I also had the vegetarian meatball parmigiana that I've never seen anywhere else! I definitely recommend it to people who are shomer kashrut and vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Don't let the minimalist decor fool you; this place is so tasty!  My husband and I are not even vegetarian, but both our sandwiches (Popeyes and Battleship) were phenomenal and HUGE (could easily be split).  The staff was also very friendly.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here to check out the only vegetarian restaurant in Squirrel Hill (that i know of).  It feels very much like a place you would see at the food court of a mall.  Everything is served on paper plates with plastic utensils.  The food however is pretty tasty and kosher.  I would come here if you're a vegetarian/vegan and want to eat out for not a lot of money."}
{"text":"Service was 5 stars. The staff was friendly, and the food was served quite fresh and fast. We dined on the Cheddar Ranch pizza.  It was really tasty, but WAY cheesy and filling. Even my husband could only manage to eat a slice and a half.  It was reasonably priced and i would get a pie from here again.  

The family sized cheese fries was AMPLE and well-priced. It came out piping hot and the fries were the perfect balance of crispy outside and soft inside. 

The soft serve ice cream is quite sweet. They basically give you a styro coffee cup and let you fill it as you choose,  which is nice. 

They also have unlimited refills on fountain drinks, which gets major thumbs up from me and my family. 

To summarize: reasonably priced for kosher pizza, large servings, free refills on drinks in a fast, friendly, and clean place. We'll be back the next time we're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Overpriced and under managed. Jalapeño poppers thrown in the oven and not made with actual peppers... $7.00?! Also, I ordered a bowl of soup, paid for it and then was told they were out. Got a refund but no soup. Bummer! Now the manager is addressing his staff within ear shot of customers... Hmmmm... I've eaten here 2 others time and had similar experiences. Maybe it's time to write it off my list."}
