{"text":"The food is awesome the ceviche is the best but u have to try the bean and cheese burritos I love them"}
{"text":"Best tacos in West Phoenix! I had tacos de lengua & de cabeza, they both were absolutely delicious! The meat was moist and had great flavor. I only wish they took debit but I'll make an atm trip for these guys no problem!!"}
{"text":"I was expecting it to be a little more authentic ... Salsa wasnt spicy , chips were'nt very good...tacos were ok"}
{"text":"Great food truck with all the classic Sinaloense foods. It is all great, but my favorite has to be the carne asada burritos and just ask for grilled onions on the side."}
{"text":"This establishment offers an almost perfect \"tacos de la calle\" (street tacos) experience.  I tried their lengua (cow tongue), birria (marinated goat), and cabeza (cow cheek) tacos. All the meats and were prepared well and very tasty.  Do not be afraid to stop by, it may look a little rough, but they are serving some delicious fresh Mexican street food."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I've never been disappointed with the food or service. I call in my order and it's always ready as promised. It's one of my go-to places for good tacos, burritos and ceviche."}
{"text":"I make a point to come eat here at least once a week. The food is consistently delicious and you can't beat the price!!"}
{"text":"The Cabeza Tacos was well served and the flavor was really good, worthy of 5 star's on its own. The Carne Asada tacos also well served, not much flavor, over cooked and dry. Worthy of 1 star."}
{"text":"This place sells the best burritos! It's better than any betos their salsas are pretty good and they give you a lot of meat on their burritos!"}
{"text":"It's not wow place , some plates are very good. I love the tacos what I usaully go for the  cow tungue, cow brain and  tacos al pastor. I go with my family to dine prices are ok , very simple place . Over in all it's good the horchatas drink hits the spot for a hot day. Try it is not that bad ....."}
{"text":"Well sometimes it's Great and other days it's not so good.... Today I was bummed! This is the second time I get a super salty burrito, almost as if they are trying to mask something. I have even gone back to return it due to the lack of quality. The owner is very graceful and helpful. He offered to replace the item (mar y Tierra burrito), which I did for an amazing shrimp burrito. Maybe it's the meats? I was craving something close to home and I ordered the chile rojo burrito. I should have went with the shrimp! The beans are really good here too, I just wish the flavor and quality was consistent with all the menu items."}
{"text":"We like the carne asada fries and rolled tacos. It's not the best mexican restaurant, but way better than Felibertos. I would recommend this place if its a convenient drive for you."}
{"text":"Tried the breakfast burritos. They were on special for 2.50 which hopefully was the reason the filling was so skimpy. I would rather pay full price, 4.99, and get all the ingredients. On a good note the tortilla was good."}
{"text":"Well I have tried to give this place another opportunity to redeem themselves (times 3)..even after repeatedly notifying them about my concern..They didn't seem to care. Sadly,  It just isn't the same anymore from when they first open. The food has gone to decent portions to little for the price and the taste of the food is very salty and bitter from way too much salt.    The beans and chicken are not what I expected..  There must be some regulation on how much salt is used if food when being prepared. I'm concerned."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! The carnitas is on point! This is an awesome hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place lacks something. At times it's good and other times it sucks.  The service is always dumb.  The only thing for sure is that it's a good place to grab a bite if you're really hungry and it's on your way somewhere.  For sure they have better food than across the street!!!!"}
{"text":"This food stand serves up really tasty comida (food). I love this sandwich (la torta de Cubana) :)   The staff are friendly and seem to really enjoy what they do. I'm looking forward to trying some other menu items soon! Muchas gracias, mis amigos!!!"}
{"text":"Over priced for the quality and taste they offer. Don't think I'll be going back. Their customer service needs some help too we didn't get our drinks until we started eating and they weren't nice enough to even bring to the table. Simply not going back."}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing! So are the chips and salsa. Great price. This place is a hidden gem! Strongly recommend to anyone who wants the best tacos in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"It was ok. I've had better tacos downtown. The meat was dry. I like my street tacos fresh and hot."}
{"text":"The Best Street Side Tacos in Phoenix! I've been searching for real tacos in Phoenix for years and this place has them. Cabeza, lengua, carne, pastor and there served up with grilled jalepenos and onions. Everything is great their tortas, beans, rice, ceviche. The flavors are spot on."}
{"text":"I live near this food truck, and eat here about twice a month, sometimes more.  We have visited for YEARS.  Have you heard the saying, \"Don't judge a book by its cover?\" Don't let the fact this food truck sits on the corner of Van Buren next to a used tire place fool you.  The food is terrific.  Never, ever, have we been sick from eating here!  And we eat here a LOT.  Real food, prepared well, absolutely delicious.  Our favorite is the Carne Asada street tacos.  I also love the Vegetarian Burrito!  The flour tortillas are heavenly.  My boyfriend enjoys the Ceviche.  It's safe, super fresh, and totally delicious.  There is a reason this food truck has been parked here for years, and hasn't ever moved.  It's good food.  In fact, they added a dine-in place on 83rd and McDowell, and it has air conditioning there, but we still get a kick out of sitting outside to eat on nice days, so this is still our first choice.  If I had any criticism, I'd say the red salsa at this place is \"meh\" but the green salsa at the dine-in location is amazing!  And it would be nice if they posted prices somewhere - it's a bit intimidating to look at such a general menu with no prices posted?  (Prices are posted at the dine-in location, though.)"}
{"text":"All the reviews are saying that it is the best thing. I will definitely not agree with that. I found the carne asada  to be like nothing that I have ever had. I truly believe that I was given something else, it looked a lot more like pork than carne asada."}
{"text":"Great group of chef's serving authentic food right in front of you.They have a big tent with plenty of seating .My favorite is the goat soup it is a nice gravy - broth cooked tender like a pot roast.I got a bean burrito on about my 5th time there and I feel this is the best pne in Phoenix!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like the food is a little bit salty but nothing major, also prices are kind if high for tacos but at the end is good place to go once in a while."}
{"text":"I came here for the tacos and they were not the greatest. I ordered 5 carne asada tacos and the meat was salty. They were $2 each on top of that. The taco size is decent. I will never come back but surprised people still do."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo and asked for salsa verde because it's my favorite and my husband got street tacos: lengua, cabeza, and birria. I tried the lengua and birria, and they were both delicious! He said the cabeza was delicious as well, I'll take his word on that one! I'm so glad we found this taco joint! :) It's the best street tacos ice tried since we were in Guadalajara, Mexico! :) We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for great enchilada style burrito and we finally found it!! They have two different kinds of enchilada sauce green and red. They are both amazing. There rice and beans are amazing as well. I'll only go here from now on."}
{"text":"I came here today wanting some good street tacos. I ordered 1 kids quesadilla, 6 tacos and one torta. My bill was $23. I thought it was a bit expensive but i figured it would be a good amount of food. Once I got home I see that the quesadilla is a medium size corn tortilla folded in half. The tacos were small and cold by the time I got home and I live 2 blocks away from this place. I check my receipt and I paid $2.25 per taco, $2.50 for the quesadilla. The only decent thing was the torta, which was $7. I won't be coming back here, I'm highly dissatisfied in the small amount of food you get for the price. It honestly didn't taste that good either, I could have gone to filibertos and had a bigger portion and it would have been cheaper and taste better."}
{"text":"Not good. I ordered a chili verde burrito, since when is the sauce brown?? You may rethink your options here. I spent $17 bucks, ($3 tip). Could have went to a real sit down restaurant  with real plates ( they use styrofoam plates , bowls ) for that price. Mr Leno is across the street. I will try them next time , you may want to go there first. Good luck."}
{"text":"This place was soo great!! I love the small places because they always taste the best!! My bf who is from culiacan Sinaloa said the food tasted so authentic! We went twice to this place in a two day period. The ceviche tostadas and the birria were my favorite!! My bf ordered the tacos and quesadillas it was all great!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito. Very friendly and not shy on the serving size!!   The tortilla is soft and flavorful and the bacon is nice and thick. I couldn't even eat half of it so I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.  I just wish they gave you more salsa!"}
{"text":"Very very good. Better than any fast food place. The food was tasty and inexpensive. They charge  (.50) per credit card charge. I would definitely recommend this taco truck."}
{"text":"I'm not sure with the reviews here.  Real Carne asada is decent sized cuts and grilled beef, what they serve here is shredded beef all small and grey. No thanks"}
{"text":"Prices are great and the food is delicious!  Red sauce is the best I've had, that wasn't homemade! Enchiladas excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Recently opened and I have been there three times. I eat a lot of Mexican fast food and Tacos la Lomita is one of the better fast food type sit down locations."}
{"text":"My tacos were gooood! I got carne asada tacos and I can say they were different but they were really good. They give you a side of caramelized onions. Soo good."}
{"text":"CHEATED!! On my regular taco truck, my husband and I were sent here on a good word from an acquaintance. We also hit up taco trucks around The Valley. I had the Pastor which wasn't that bad flavorful and juicy. But the little itty bitty chop per up cabbage and one itty bitty leaf of cilantro no onion hardly, very bitter cucumbers and dry limes killed it. My husband had the carne Asada which he said was dry and no flavor. Also the little cup of bean juice and two little chopped up hot dogs could be left out. I would say I most likely won't be back sucks because all the workers were really nice."}
{"text":"The food here is great!I love going on saturdays and Sundays because that's when they serve menudo and it's sooo good taste fresh, only wish they were a bit cleaner, all the times I've gone the menudo has been good except for one time it was watered down and didn't taste fresh but all the other times it's been great!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and was definitely expecting more. I paid more than $11 for two average size flour quesadillas, a drink and was very disappointed. They were over priced and I was still hungry after eating both quesadillas. The quesadillas weren't very tasty and definitely over priced. Unfortunately, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Tacos lack flavor, pretty greasy, not the best tacos in Phoenix.  Better tacis somewhere else."}
{"text":"Basic Mexican food at its finest. You could go to Taco Bell and get the same food. Will Never go again cuz it's basura"}
{"text":"Amazing food at amazing prices! Tacos, burritos, mix tad and their tostadas de ceviche are to die for! It's literally a taco truck on the northeast corner of 75th Ave/Van Buren, with lots of parking available just outside of a tire shop. There are very clean tables and chairs as well as a canopy to sit under for shade! My siblings and I recently did a 'dinner date' here with our families and had to compliment the cooks as we left! They also have a Bluetooth speaker playing a great mix of cumbias (hehe) This is the spot to go if you're in the mood for some AUTHENTIC Mexican food on the go!"}
{"text":"We ordered two combos... tthe refried beans were a bit watery-other than that it was pretty average. The rice was pretty good. The meals were under $15.00 for two people."}
{"text":"Awesome food truck food. I tried the birria quesadillas and they were delicious. My only complaint would be the prices but other than this is the perfect place for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best and most amazing place to eat. Any time any day. Specially on their breakfast burritos Monday-Friday $2.99 (7am to 11am) regular price $4.99 to $5.99 & great variety on them also."}
{"text":"i walk in its hot day as soon as i seen the salsa bar i ran to it i love salsa to my dismay it was not fresh i made the staff aware and they put more out but it was from the same batch not fresh spoiled ... i ordered 2 tacos de cabeza and 2 de asada the cabeza were good thats why there getting 2 stars but the the asada were not good at all the meat was old a weird taste .... the staff were a great bunch of people but the food was not cutting my taste."}
{"text":"First timer.  Tacos were awesome!!  Great service and the eating area was clean and comfortable.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The carne asada quesadilla is served a bit wet in a red sauce. Makes it messy to eat but it's yummy. The carne asada tacos were very good. Nice big fulfilling tacos. But only 2 stars because they suck, I don't understand why salsa is not given more. One half full small small container of salsa is not enough for 3 tacos. I dislike that  they won't give accurate amount  of salsa, it's not realistic !"}
{"text":"We ordered tacos de lengua, chicharrón, al pastor and asada they were all good, but the tacos de asada could have been better. I recommend chicharrón & al pastor.  The taco truck has covered seating too."}
