{"text":"It is wonderful to have an independent quality pizzeria in the East Valley.    It's amazing how you can taste the difference of quality ingredients versus the chain brands.     One of my other favorite things about twisted pies is how they effectively they brown the pizza instead of just sending it down the conveyor belt.   It makes such a huge flavor difference of both the crust and the toppings.    Love the daily specials, great value, great quality"}
{"text":"Found this new place with amazing flavor.....there twisted variety are a good change....and even the service is friendly...they will even deliver a greater distance than most places....again great specials, great food and great service."}
{"text":"I was fortunate to have come across this family-owned pizza joint after finding it on Groupon. Both the pizza and wings were fresh and exceeded my expectations. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"We have twisted pies pizza before.. which is always good !!! We got the wings for the first  time with our pizza last night !! And we they good! I now have a new favirie wing place! I am glad we got exta wings because I got to repeat last nights dinner for lunch today! It's hard to get good wings and good pizza in the same place! Thank you guys your awesome!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile but wanted to leave a review after visiting a Gilbert pizzaria that is touted as \"Arizona's Best Pizza\". We went there today and all I could think of was how much better Twisted Pies was. They should be advertising the best pizza, because it was so good I can't get it out of my head lol When we went we ordered a salami (capicolla maybe?) pizza with mushrooms. The crust was chewy yet crunchy and the sauce was delicious. Very rich and yummy. If this place was not a 30-40 minute drive for us, we'd eat there more often. I really want to go back now, as I see they have extended the menu a lot.  I thought of you today, Twisted Pies!  As a side note, yes, the decor was limited at the time we went, but clean. This did not affect the quality of the pizza or the excellent customer service. As others have mentioned, there is so much care that goes into the preparation and cooking here. You won't find this level of awesome anywhere else, not even the \"Best Pizza\" place in Arizona (was Twisted Pies on the ballot? If they were they surely would have won. Definitely the BEST I've ever had!)  Give them a shot. I think you'll love it :)"}
{"text":"One of the absolute best we have had in Mesa. Great pizza, great wings, and great service Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in quite awhile. I've been noticing that EVERY pizza place has been skimping on the sauce lately. Not so here. And it is really good sauce.   But that's not all that's great about this pizza. the crust is perfect thickness, the toppings were delicious. And it doesn't cost a lot of money for the quality that you get."}
{"text":"Had this pizza 5 times now and it continues to be consistent and fresh tasting every time. One of the best pizzas I have had. The sauce on the pizza, light crunchy crust and high quality ingredients are so good. I highly recommend this friendly, family owned establishment in Mesa.   The pizza is the star, 5 stars. Had one with pepperoni and fresh cut mushrooms. There was just the right amount of homemade sauce on a crunchy, yet chewy crust. The cheese was great and spices were just right. Affordable pricing for the quality we received.  Super friendly and helpful owners. We look forward to the continued improvements to the front of the house. We love to support a family owned, local business. Hope everyone else does too!"}
{"text":"Was browsing the internet to look for a new place to eat for lunch since there isn't a lot of places around me and I came across this little gem. Let me just say the food is amazing. I ordered a small mexican pizza, honey hot wings, mild wings, spaghetti with sausage and chocolate chip cookies. The pizza was way better than i thought it would be very flavorful the crust was delicious and cooked perfectly. Love the way they cook their wings they are nice and crispy and the sauces are both very good although i could have personally used a little but more sauce on mine cause i love sauce. My coworker said the spaghetti was very good well the portion size was huge for the price. I will definetly be coming back and trying some of their other pizzas. Might I add they are very quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"Wifey likes the sauce and I like the cheese, can't beat a combination like that! Wings are made extra crispy as we requested. Hole-in-the-wall place, that I hope stays that way."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went based on Yelp reviews. The Wednesday special was for a full order of wings. It's not something we'd normally get, but decided to give them a try in honey Hot. We also had the pesto pizza. Would totally recommend both. I always look for a good crust on a pizza to set it above another. This one was top notch. They had a lot of delicious sounding pies on the menu. Looking forward to trying others in the future. Great price point and friendly service also made this place an excellent find."}
{"text":"First time ordering and the Meat Pie excellent!  The crust was crispy and chewy.  The sauce was delicious and more meat than I expected.  Whoever was cooking Thursday night nailed it.  I look forward to ordering again, soon."}
{"text":"A true hidden gem of a place. doesn't look like much from outside but this is top notch pizza for sure."}
{"text":"If I could give them more stars I would, this is hands down the best pizza this city has to offer, their prices are cheaper than the chain pizza restaurants and 100X better! You can tell from the moment you open that box that these ingredients are of the best quality and prepared with care and passion, this is small family owned and operated business they are good people, support your local businesses!   Everyone and their mother should try Twisted Pies!"}
{"text":"Ah-maz-ing! Never had a better crust... It had the crunch and slight chew and flavor of a fresh baguette. None of that super chewy, yeast tasting, junk like pretty much everywhere else. Tomato sauce was the perfect consistency and had such delicate flavor and texture. And the meat, don't even get me started on the pepperoni... I don't normally like pepperoni AT ALL. I guess I can't say that anymore. Just give it a try, don't judge the book by its cover.   P.s. Get the wings too! They're cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Boy o boy do I like this place!  Small little mom & pop place that uses high quality ingredients and very reasonable prices . I tried the carnivore pie on my first visit (I've been known to eat meat on occasion) and I swear my eyes rolled back in head at the first bite.  She uses San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce and sources local ingredients whenever possible. Give it a try and support your local businesses."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places east of Phoenix. They are always very friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza right here in Mesa! Fast and friendly service. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place for awhile now. So, the hubby and I decided to give it a try, glad we did! We ordered a 16\" Pizza and sat down to wait for it, both the husband (cook) and wife were very friendly and made sure we were comfortable.  Got the pizza home, and was impressed with the freshness of of the toppings and the sauce was very very tasty! We will definitely be going back there again!"}
{"text":"Tried it tonight...thanks to yelpers!  Was everything they said!  We had the x-large pizza and wings deal!!  Great price and great food!  Wings we ordered were half bbque and half extra hot!  They were perfect!!  The pizza was topnotch!  Been looking for a place for four years to replace our fav Utah pizzaria!  So glad we found it tonight!  The service was friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"Good NY style pizza. Ordered pizza and wings.Good flavor on the wings but not as saucy as i prefer but just my 2 cents. Pizza was very good, crust was perfect and very reasonably priced. Simple menu and friendly customer service. Will definitely go back and hope to see them stick around."}
{"text":"I tried Twisted Pies because it was nearby to me and reviews seemed reasonable. I ordered online and everything went smoothly. I was very impressed with the whole process. When I arrived at Twisted Pies to pickup my order, I was perplexed to find out that they had no record of my order. They explained that orders from there website were routed through a number of different vendors for execution and some of these vendors were better than others. I really didn't want to know the details behind my order being lost and, informed the associate that I was going to depart rather than start the order process again at that time. The owner overheard my discussion with his employee as the owner was taking orders over the phone. The owner never acknowledged my issue even after seeing me leave his store. I sat in my car for several minutes to allow the owner an opportunity to talk to me if he wanted to try to rectify the situation. He didn't do so much as look my way. This business is heading for difficult times in my experience."}
{"text":"Went with family to Twisted Pies tonight for the first time and really enjoyed our experience.  We tried the white garlic pizza and the margarita, along with some wings and house salads.  Fantastic all around.  Hot, tasty wings with a nice sauce (mild in this case because of other family members).  Generous fresh house salads (not the typical little brown bowl with iceberg lettuce and shredded carrot matchsticks).  Best of everything were the pizzas: super fresh, very well balanced, and delicious crust (the heart of any great pizza).    The owner came out and chatted with us.  He definitely believes in doing as much as possible (if not everything) from scratch and using quality ingredients.  It definitely comes through in the food!    Twisted pies isn't fancy or pretentious.  Personally I could care less.  It's a small family run place...the best kind of place to my mind.  With food as good as they're serving up, Twisted Pies is a great new find in an area that sorely needs some good Italian.  We'll be dining there again for sure."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Margaritta pizza is best that I've tried in AZ.  Chessey sticks we're awesome!  Salads were a great value too."}
{"text":"Wow! I have lived out here for so long and haven't found real good pizza being from the East Coast. I came here one night with my roommate because we were hungry for pizza. Read the reviews and decided to give it a shot. Well I'm glad we did. The food was so delicious! We ordered pizza and mozzarella sticks. The staff was so nice and attentive. I can't wait to go back and order more food. We will definitely be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time customer but definitely not the last, ordered a 16 inch and a dozen buffalo wings. The pizza/dough was excellent, crunchy on the outer and soft inside(homemade)and cooked to perfection. I would have liked a little extra sauce as it was very good too. I would recommend Twisted Pies for good food at a fair price and awesome service."}
{"text":"Sometimes the best pizza is where you'd least expect it.  My two favorite pizzerias in Arizona?    One is in....Gila Bend (yes, seriously!), and the other is in....East Mesa.  Twisted Pies rocks!  If you are looking for atmosphere to impress a date - this probably isn't your place.  But if you are interested in one of the best pizzas in Arizona, this should be on your list.  The pizza is clearly the highlight - crust, cheese, and sauce are all impressive (I stick to the traditional marina sauce - can't speak to the other options).  The chicken wings are also quite good.  I see little reason to order spaghetti at a restaurant, but my wife disagrees, and gives a thumbs up to the pasta with/marinara sauce.  Constructive criticism on the food?  None.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Constructive criticism on service?  Staff and owner friendly & attentive - no issues there.  Only thing I would like to see is hard-plastic plates & metal cutlery - not the kind of thing that will keep me from going back, but would be nice."}
{"text":"Twisted Pies is cool little spot. I came for good pizza and they delivered just that. We ordered some boneless wings and an Italian salad as well. Everything was delicious. We'll definitely roll through again."}
{"text":"We are snowbirds, from Oregon...  Sure, we have good pizza at home but NOTHING compares to Twisted Pies!  In the past I never ate the edge of the pizza crust - but TP crust is to die for - along with the rest of the pizza!  Quality ingredients, great service and so convenient with delivery if you need it.  We love our pizzas with an olive oil and garlic base, instead of tomato, and it truly is hands down, the best pizza I've ever eaten!  Don't know how I  am leave Mesa in April - we definitely need a Twisted Pies shop in Bend, Oregon!  If I could give them 10 stars, I would!!!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal.  Been looking a great non chain pizza place and this is it.  We ordered three different pizzas and they were all amazing."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this one, a 3 or a 4.  Good pizza. One of the better pizzas in the area.  Had the CBA, pepperoni, and buffalo chicken.  Would get the pepperoni and buffalo chicken again.  CBA was a little bland for me but others liked it.  Could tell they use fresh ingredients.  Garden salad was a basic salad, a little small.  Spent a long time trying to get through, phone was busy.  Took a long time to pay and leave, only 1 person working up front."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp reviews. It lived up to its rating. Had a pepperoni pizza that was delicious. Others in our group had a similar experience."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat, great food, service is really on top of it, and Damm good prices."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area. Fantastic red sauce!! And they know the right way to make Buffalo Wings. What else does one need?"}
{"text":"Relatively speaking the pizza is above average for ARIZONA. I'm born and raised in NY and I love a good pie. I've been searching tirelessly since relocating here 6 years ago. My fiancé and I have both worked in the pizza biz for over 20 years combined. The sauce has good flavor but I suspect it is not cooked. Just crushed tomatoes with some garlic and herbs right out of the can. It's a tad watery and keeps the cheese from sticking and leaves the crust a little soggy under the toppings. The dough tasted fresh and had good texture. It was baked well done which I like.  I enjoy some good chew to my pizza crust. However the flavor was a little flat. The cheese was excellent! As were the other toppings.  All in all it's GOOD but not knock your socks off as the other posters led me to believe.  I wanted to love it. I wanted my search for GREAT pizza I AZ to be over but sadly it's not.  It's worth giving them a try.  I will be back again just to see if my second impression overrides the first impression.  An honest \"mom and pop\" pizza joint deserves to be given a fair shake in this corporate chain dominated market."}
{"text":"Best pizza hands down! Always look for a great pizza place and I think I've found it. The food was delivered on time and still warm. We had the boneless wings they were good but I think next time I will stick with just the pizza and try a speciality one."}
{"text":"My husband and I didn't really like them very much. We ordered calzones and garlic knots. The calzones were pretty well-done, to the point that a corner was burnt on mine. The garlic knots were kinda chewy and tough. We also ordered the cinnamon knots that were supposed to come with chocolate sauce and stuff - nah, they just came plain. Overall we found them really mediocre. They weren't awful but we won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Ok Ive always loved the wings here.  Tasty crispy wings. Thought Id try the wings under the new owners,  I was dissapointed. The wings were ok but they did not have the crispy presence I was used to at Twistedpies. I dont think the wings were put under the broiler after frying and saucing them, if they were they were pulled out way too soon. Also I met the new owner, not friendly at all. I really was used to the friendly atmosphere from the original owners. So needless to say twistedpies is off my regular visit list."}
{"text":"1st time visiting today. Drove all the way from San Tan Valley. Had the Perfect Pepperoni and it was. Great crust and very fresh ingredients.Perfect!!"}
{"text":"I expected so much better from this place..considering the reviews.  I got the margarita and pepperoni 16\" with 1/2 pound hot wings Chunky sauce, not a typical marinara; flavorless. The crust is thin and hard. The whole pie was soggy and the cheese just slides off. Hot wings weren't sauced, it was just chicken wings that are fried. Nothing about it was hot.  I just don't understand why this place had such great reviews. The pictures look nothing like what I received. I will not return here."}
{"text":"Just pizza and wings, with a passion.    Twisted pies is not your average pizza place. It is completely family run and operated. The owner is in the kitchen and his wife is at the register, running food and cleaning tables. The dining room is small, the selection of drinks is limited (a 6 spot soda fountain) and a glass warmer case for pizza by the slice (not currently offered) sits between the register and the cooler for bottled drinks. This is not the place to go for atmosphere and hanging out with friends. The menu is essentially limited to pizza and wings. There is a nice selection of traditional and original pizzas plus build your own. Wings are kept simple, flats and drums or boneless, with you choice of six sauces.    We ordered a 14\" half taco, half crispy pig pizza and a dozen honey hot wings. The wings arrived at the table in reasonable amount of time giving us something to munch on while we waited for the pizza. There were 3 of us sharing the order and requesting a third side of ranch was not an issue. The wings were nicely sauced and had a bit of caramelization on one side, because they are fried and then finished in the oven. This gives the wings perfect crispness and they are not greasy. The honey hot sauce complimented the taste of the chicken without covering it up. There was enough sauce to coat each wing without drowning them.    The pizza arrived just we finished the last wing. The first thing I noticed was the size. If this was a 14\" pizza, they were measuring the area covered by toppings not the overall size. Rich, the owner, brought it to us himself and apologized because he had left it in too long (which means he cooks in an oven not on a conveyor belt) and the crust was a little over done. It was a little dark at the edge but not burnt so we decided to try it before requesting it to be remade. This was a very good choice. The crust had a nice chew and the bottom was crispy. The amount of toppings was generous without overloading the pie.    The taco pizza is what it sounds like, a layer of refried beans and cheese topped with lettuce, tomato and taco sauce. it is an excellent presentation of this type of pizza. The crispy pig is a different story. It starts life as a garlic, mozzarella, and ricotta pizza. Then lettuce tomato and bacon are added on top. Yes, they put a BLT on a pizza. I highly recommend this pie.   It is had to find truly hand crafted pizza. This is not hand made, but hand crafted by a man passionate about his pies. The dough is mixed, kneaded and raised over 24 hours. Sauces and toppings are prepared fresh. Crusts are hand tossed to order. Stop by and give them a try.  Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff) -Traditional pizza done right by people that care. -Fresh ingredients. -Totally operated and run by family. -Unique cooking method for wings that works. -Plenty of napkins right on the table (you wont need as many as you think).  Cold Baldies (the not so good stuff) -Dining room is sparse and cluttered on the edges (remember they focus on the food and carryout). -Hard to find (it's tucked in the back of a strip mall)."}
{"text":"Very tasty and loved the crust! Took a star off because the italian sausage was a little light. Next time I'll order it with double sausage."}
{"text":"How much say their service here is that outstanding very nice people they really want to make sure you have a good time enjoy yourself here the pizza was pretty good wasn't the best I've ever had it was above average I would say I had mushrooms and onions it probably could be cooked crispy but the cheese tasted good sauce was good too it was okay their wings or pretty good size sauces good just not crispy I think they fry and then bake them kind of weird I think if he just fry them will stay crispy Southern Living around the area definitely give it a try"}
{"text":"Picked up 3 pies, pepperoni, Hawaiian and margherita.  Of the 3 the margherita was the best.  Small local place but would go back"}
{"text":"This appears to be a family owned and operated business and it is excellent. Number one, the pizza is excellent, we had the Supreme and I don't believe I have ever seen such huge slices of pepperoni. The owner told us that everything was homemade and we could tell, the tomato sauce was unlike any we have ever had - it was chunky and tasty and I didn't need my usual heartburn pill afterward. What a pleasant surprise. Everyone was very friendly, the service was excellent and we enjoyed our visit. We went to this restaurant because we heard rave reviews about the quality and tastiness of the pizza. We will be back."}
{"text":"We ate here the first time and shared a salad, a pizza and a plate of spaghetti. Everything was delicious. We went back a week later and had their wings and each a plate of spaghetti! Delicious again. We will continue to go and try new things."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's my favorite pizza in Mesa. The homemade marina is the secret, and the Spicy Pizza with fresh jalapeños is my favorite choice there. The wings are good, I've had the boneless and traditional, definitely go with the traditional - but the real reason why you go here is because the pizza, made by the owner who is in the kitchen working hard everyday, is simply the best."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service! Lovely family owned pizza joint that's using home made ingredients and serving it up with a friendly smile, couldn't ask for anything better! We will be coming back, yummy!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem driving around for work.ordered the pepperoni as spicy sausage 8\" (which is a 4 slice personal pizza) and the spaghetti. I told myself I would taste spaghetti and then take a picture and I enjoyed it so much I forgot to take a picture lol def worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Have only ordered pick up a couple of times, but haven't been disappointed. High quality pizza and the wings are really good. Definitely a local gem."}
{"text":"Saw all the great reviews of this place so I decided to give it a try. I have to say this is really good pizza. 1st I drove almost 25 minutes to try this so I I had high expectations. I LOVED IT.  1.the pizza has great crust half thin and towards the end thicker and crispy mmmmmm. 2.The sauce personally I don't like sauce but this sauce I really really liked it is well seasoned and not to tomatoey[not a word].  3.toppings they must use more than 1 type of cheese the taste and texture is grate. Big pepperoni and two types of Sausage to choose from.  4.Ordering easy and super friendly.On the phone and on there shop. I WOULD 100% drive here again and will tell others to go here you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone. Great customer service, pizza was ready when I was told it would be. I would definitely come here again! Food was fresh and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Just tried the pizza here and it is amazing! Definitely worth the drive from Gilbert. Always nice to support family owned businesses with great food.  My family and I will be back."}
{"text":"I wanted some pizza. Found this place on Yelp and immediately ordered for delivery after seeing 41/2 stars. I should have gone to Frys and bought a frozen pie. I had the supreme. It was undercooked and the bottom of the pie was soggy and tasted like raw dough. The toppings were tasteless and the cheese and other toppings were hard to find. The pie was $18 and not as good as a $10 pizza from Papa Johns. I asked for some dipping sauce for a friend and was told they didn't have such a thing. Really?  I also ordered some garlic knots that were dry and chewy. Nobody would eat them. How about some garlic oil to help them out and some fresh garlic so you can taste the garlic. I also ordered spaghetti and meatballs and it was what I expected from a place like this. Way to much bread crumbs, over cooked noodles and a pretty tasteless sauce."}
{"text":"AMAZING pizza. I highly recommend ding in. The walls are fun to look at, the music is tasteful, and the staff is very fun and friendly. I was served fast and well, and they have Coke products. Yum!"}
{"text":"Little pizza shop with BIG flavor!! Awesome Pies lots to choose from or build your own. Menu even has Pasta and some salads as well. The hot wings were great! Would definitely one back or even get their delivery service. These are pizzas of my youth, hand made with real ingredients and lots of flavor. My new favorite pizza spot!!"}
{"text":"Always an excellent meal. Nice variety of  pizzas and wings. Very friendly.  We always feel welcomed and appreciated.   Thanks again."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good, and salads very good. Friendly, small, family run place where the food is pretty good. HOWEVER... The dining room was deplorable. I mean, it was terribly run down. There was an old, crusty/rusty deep fryer next to the soda machine, just sitting there. Seriously, take it out back, put it in an alley, store it somewhere else. On the way to the bathroon, there was a broken (glass) picture frame in the hall where some kid could injure themselves on that. Truly a hazard. Bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in 3 weeks, waste paper basket was overflowing, etc. I think this place could be OK, and I'd love to change my review if I ever made it back there (don't live close by). But, pay attention to some details, clean the joint up, splash on some fresh paint, put up some newer decorations, etc. The condition of the place far outweighed the quality of food."}
{"text":"****We've since been back and it wasn't anywhere near as good as the first time, it was pretty bland and flavorless and the crust wasn't great :( not sure what happened, but the service was still amazing. Very sweet staff.   Just had such a great experience here! We ordered late and actually thought it was a place much closer to us. The woman on the phone was a doll and answered all my questions. A man named Amis (not sure on the spelling) delivered the pizza to us after he was actually off, just on his way home. Was so SO pleasant, didn't make me feel like it was any trouble at all. Point being customer service alone was awesome!   Now to the pizza. We're fairly discerning having come from New York and we all agreed this is definitely some of the better pizza we've found in AZ. Sauce was good, not shy on the garlic and super generous with the toppings too and the crust was good too. My only suggestion would be to not get extra cheese. They suggested it since we only got toppings on half the pizza but it's was too much cheese for my tasting. Overall though, thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, and would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love pizza. Pomo, Spinato's, etc... This pizza is amazing. The crust is unusually full but light and a treat for your mouth. The toppings are good quality. I just wish there was a bit more cheese. Other then that it was an amazing pizza. I also wish they had more locations. Hopefully everyone try's it to allow them to expand."}
{"text":"1) Ordered online. YELP app would not connect and process PayPal. Had to go through browser to complete order. Not sure if this is an app issue or merchant issue. Order processed online, pickup time was 6:41. I show up at 6:39, get pizza at 6:56. No explanation for delay. 2) Pizza ordered all mushrooms, half sausage. Rather skimpy on the sausage, which was spread over 3/4 of the pie. Crust over cooked. Cheese rather gooey.  Would not return to this shop."}
{"text":"Inexpensive but surprisingly yummy pizza. Perfect crust. Tried this place on a whim. Very happy with the taste. We'll be eating here again. Plus they deliver."}
{"text":"This place is a winner. I found it on Yelp, got some friends together and visited for the first time. We had 2 different kinds of chicken wings. They made the honey hot mild enough that I could enjoy them, the hot was hot enough for the others. The Pizza was terrific. The staff was friendly, and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Should not be named a pizza place. Pizza was too gummy, sausage had green peppers. Compared to pizza yucky hut, I would eat there before going back to the pizza pie. But maybe the rest of the menu is ok. Just change the name."}
{"text":"We went to this place last night with our kids.  There was a decently sized dine in area with booths and tables.  Service was efficient and friendly.  We ordered wings, cheesy bread, a 12 inch cheese pizza, and a 10 in deep-fried crust pepperoni and cheese.  The wings and cheesy bread came out first.  I had to wait to try the bread because I couldn't put the wings down.  They were amazing! The crust of the cheesy bread had a slight crunch on the outside while being fluffy on the inside.  When the pizza came out, our kids devoured the cheese while my wife and I had the deep fried crust pepperoni.  The deep fried crust was amazing.  Somewhat hard to describe, sort-of like a non-sweet elephant ear. Very light and airy while still having a satisfying crunch.  All the ingredients were remarkably fresh, and the sauce at this place is AMAZING.  Lastly, the prices were VERY reasonable.  We ate for less than I would usually expect when taking the family out, and had plenty to take home as well.  Being from Chicago, we have found it hard to find new pizza places that serve truly great pizza.  While this isn't Chicago style pizza, it is very approved by a Chicago family that are somewhat pizza snobs.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The best part of this one of a kind pizza place is the owner personally mades our pizzas and delivered them to our table. Delicious wings, salads and every pizza we've tried has been delicious! We keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away in a little strip mall that has seen better days. The restaurant is small but has delightful pizza and the decor is Mediterranean with a pretty mural on the wall. The crust on the pizza was perfectly crispy and the fresh basil was a very good touch on the toppings."}
{"text":"I ordered the buffalo chicken and spicy italian pizzas just days ago.  The buffalo chicken was only OK and the menu would lead one to believe that there is an abundance of Frank's Red Hot on the pizza which is simply not the case.  The spicy italian was much better and certainly packed a punch.  The crust was better than most in Phoenix, but still lacking compared to east coast establishments."}
{"text":"We needed a place with gluten-free options that wasn't a chain, and happened upon this place. I was happy the the gluten-free crust was not the same 10\" crunchy crust that every pizza place in my area has. The 10\" crunchy is fine, but i'm sick of it. Twisted Pies' gluten-free crust is thicker, sort of like a Chicago-style crust (Biscuity & doughy), which I really liked. The toppings we got were really good. Overall, a good hold in the wall pizza place that I'd recommend."}
{"text":"OK so I'm driving from one job to another and had a craving for chicken wings. Since I was in an area that I was not familiar with I decided to ask Yelp what was the best chicken wing place in Mesa Arizona. Twisted pie's pizzeria came up as number one. I called them and ordered a dozen hot wings to go. I was surprised at how small the place was, and off Street location. I however was not disappointed in the quality and taste and freshness of the wings. I must say they were the best wings that I have had in a very long time. The young man working behind the counter was wonderful, very informative, and a great personality for the business. All I ordered was the wings but I am definitely going to go back and try their pizza they have the right stuff."}
{"text":"I have eaten pizza from Barros to Spinatos in the Valley. Twisted pies is the best there is. Small store and the only thing fancy is the food. Try it and you will be hooked. Thanks and support Mom and Pop shops, sometimes they are the very best."}
{"text":"Twisted Pies Pizzeria is a local family-owned business that distinguishes itself as a pizzeria -  which is to say that they are serious about their craft.   Offered is freshly made to order New York Italian style pizza and twice cooked wings for dine in, pickup or delivery.  I chose to order online via Yelp and was treated to a minute by minute update as to the progress of my order from placing the order to the restaurant receiving the order to a knock at my door . . . nice touch.   The pizza has a nice ratio of topping to sauce to crust thickness.  The crust is both crispy and has a bit of a chew to it - kudos to the mastery of such a recipe and a proper bake in the oven; perhaps it is the special Italian flour used in the dough or just knowing the precise daily humidity and barometric pressure and then knowing how many times to knead the dough accordingly.  The sauce is certainly fresh tasting and has a great balance of sweet to acid to spice to viscosity; again, using San Marzano tomatoes and fresh garlic makes this difference. The quality of the cheese and toppings is apparent in taste and texture ensuring a consistent bite each time without the cheese sliding off the saucy crust or the toppings falling off between bites; both are also freshly sliced and grated - apparent by taste and appearance.    Care and love exist at this pizzeria and are put into each pie made and it reflects in taste.  The wings are done well, which is to say that they are twice cooked: first fried then baked.  This gives both a proper texture to the skin and allows the sauce to coat the wing evenly yet still have hints of char on them fulfilling the primal taste buds of grilled meat.  Offered are four kinds of sauce: Mild, Hot, BBQ and Spicy BBQ.  The BBQ sauce complements the cook of the wings as being not too sweet or smokey or spicy.  The mild wings are not greasy nor are they overly spiced or sauced.  I found the flavors to be on par with the better pizza and wings I have had, however, I thought both the pizza and two flavors of wings were on the salty side; being as I tolerate salt fairly well, I am guessing that most will find the saltiness a bit much, perhaps the chef was a bit heavy handed on this day.  Overall, Twisted Pies Pizzeria is a good choice for pizza and wings . . . especially if you live in their delivery area and want to order in.

{"text":"Twisted Pie is a same local comfortable restaurant. Honestly, they are super friendly and always serving up Smiles. I love Pizza and Twisted Pie offers the best pepperoni pizza in the state!

Pepperoni is crisp n delicious. Sign up for the text offers n get discounts-specials. Tell they Katt sent ya'! Check it out! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"The pizza crust and toppings were burnt. Flavor was ok. I won't be a return customer."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon and tried it out. The place is a dive which wouldn't have mattered to me if the food was good. Ordered a pound of the honey hot wings and a meat lovers large pie. The wings were of the lowest quality I've ever seen or eaten. All skin, barely any meat, meat was tough like it went from frozen to the fryer, no sauce, etc. Then the pizza came and the bacon wasn't just crispy but burnt black and the ground beef or sausage (whatever it was) was under cooked and there was next to no sauce on it either. After my second slice I started to feel sick. The only reason we took a to go box with 80% of our pizza uneaten was to not hurt the feelings of the lady that waited on us. Needless to say the pie went from our car to the dumpster and I never throw food away. I'm not a picky eater and I was cheering for this place to be good as the people were friendly but I found myself just feeling sorry for them which isn't ever the reason I go out to eat after a long work week. If they don't do a 180 stat, they'll be out of business within 3 months."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service. Wings are amazing. Best pizza in Mesa. I've ordered pizza in Mesa for 30 years and this has to be some of the best I've had. Quality ingredients, not overdone with 10 pounds of toppings like most Pizza Hut lovers get. If you love quality, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on other reviews and it didn't dissapoint.  The pizza had the look and smell that made you realize this is different from all the cornerstore pizza places.  I was a little nervous that my kids wouldn't enjoy or appreciate it but nothing left from two 16\" pizzas.  Definitely will be back and anxious to try the Margarita pizza."}
{"text":"Great little family run pizza place. Everything appears to be made from scratch including the sauce. All very fresh tasting. Nice daily specials. Staff and service was great. Decor needs sprucing up. We ate in but will probably just take out next time. Will definitely recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"Five stars on the phenomenal pizza and friendly service. Don't let the funny name fool you; these folks are slinging some serious pizzas."}
{"text":"Don't know how this has some many good reviews. Had it twice and was not impressed at all. Pizza was burnt and wet and soggy as can be. You pull a slice out of the box and all the cheese slides off. Waste of money. We of course will not be eating there. Learned my lesson."}
{"text":"I -know- pizza. I've lived in Europe, Chicago, alllll over. I haven't had pizza like this in YEARS!  We ordered their Sweet and Spicy[ San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, calabrese, jalapenos, basil and honey],and....OMG. That crust!best pizza I have had in Arizona for sure, perhaps even in the US. Spicy, sweet ,delicious- not drowning in grease and cheapass ,disgusting \"pepperoni\". It was sooooooooooo good.  We also got their wings, and antipasto salad, and everything was devoured.  Quality ingredients, the moment you open the lid of the box, you go-wow-."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, always excellent pizza! The dining area is a little small, but it isn't an issue since it seems almost all their business is delivery."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and read the reviews on.yelp this is a family owned restaurant, new york style, we had a pepperoni with jalapeño , calamari,  hot wings and garlic bread. Everything was superd, fresh. You can taste the homemade sauce. Good stuff"}
{"text":"We were told about this place from locals. What a very cool place! It's a hole in the wall kinda place that has really good food! I really wish we could have gone here many times but we found it at the end of our visit. It's worth a try!  4 Stars - Really good and wouldn't mind returning"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered a pizza from this family owned restaurant and didn't realize they closed at 8pm. When I called at 8:30 the owner was still waiting for us to come. We finally made it at 8:45 and went home to enjoy our delicious pie. We will Most definitely return to enjoy more pies from Twisted Pies."}
{"text":"We were very impressed. They offer a unique variety of pizza and our server was fantastic. They use fresh dough and bake it perfectly."}
{"text":"After having been in the foodservice business for 14 years and being Italian I was not impressed with the interior of the café or the pizza. Even though the pizza did have a fair flavor to it the crust was a little tough and over cooked. Three of use shared a pizza and we all came up with the same feelings. The café portion itself looked like it was put together on a very tight budget and the electrical outlets looked dangerous. The soda dispenser was out of service and he was selling over priced bottled soft drinks.  I am sorry but once was enough for the three of us. (Together we have 43 years in the foodservice industry)"}
{"text":"Five stars! Excellent pizza, wings & service! The owners will go out of their way to make it just how you want. They don't skimp on the toppings, either. The best homemade sauce with chunks of tomatoes, the crust is thin but not too thin & cooked to perfection, real, fresh mushrooms, red onions & the biggest, best pepperoni. Very cheesy, too. My first time trying today & I'll definitely be back. Thank you, Mike & Rachel!  -- Amy"}
{"text":"So good.  We have ordered carryout a few times and never had an issue. The Mexican pizza is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I do not write very many Yelp reviews but Twisted Pizza is out of this world good pizza. Ordered: Medium spiced Bone in Wings                Hawaiian Pizza                Spicy Italian Pizza The wings were so good. They are fried and then baked so they are not a saucy mess. It is more of a dry rub and so yummy. Intended to eat 1 but ate 4 The Hawaiian Pizza was so tasty. Looked and tasted as if they hand cut fresh pineapple and the ham slices were nice and big. The sauce was excellent and crust on point The Spicy Italian Pizza was next level. Same excellent sauce and crust but the Italian sausage was perfection. The Spicy Italian was my boys (17 & 20) pick but ended up being my favorite. Twisted Pies Pizzeria we are so happy to have you in Mesa. Grabbed my refrigerator magnet and will make you a weekly habit."}
{"text":"We went on a night that was really crowded due to a praising review for them in the paper that day. It's a small restaurant and they weren't prepared for the sudden extra business, they apologized for rushing and not being able to put the attention and care into the pizza as normal and it still tasted amazing! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, which was prompt.  One of the two pizzas we ordered was burnt however.  The crust is my favorite part of the pizza and I couldn't eat it.  Unfortunately, the whole pizza had a slight burnt taste, even when I scrapped the toppings off so I didn't have to eat burnt crust."}
{"text":"I had to try Twisted Pie based on its reviews and my immediate hunger. I ordered 2 large 2 topping pizzas to go. I went to pick them up and they were nice and warm so when I rushed home to eat them they were delicious being cooked properly being neither burnt or mushy. They also have military discount which saved me some money so I got some Ranch sauce for dipping. Staff was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Love this place! We eat a lot of pizza. Twisted Pizza is THE best! Great pizza.....Great price....Great service.....Great location!"}
{"text":"Family oriented, owned. Very fresh ingredients,all made from scratch. My new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"Maybe they had an off night, we ordered cheese sticks, the perfect pepperoni, and pizzarito.. The cheese sticks and even the marinara were bland, the cheese sticks specifically had hardly any cheese , the toppings were uneven, parmesan was on a couple sticks but many of them had none. The pizzarito was the biggest disappointment the \"Hot sauce\" was not hot at all, the ground beef tasted like plain groud beef , no seasoning, whatever else was on there was completely bland.   overall terrible experience."}
{"text":"This pizza is so amazing! Crust in crisp yet soft. I had the spicy italian and a cheese. I have never had a pizza taste so great with so many flavors. I brought it home and my hubby ate it cold first. He absolutely loves pizza and couldn't get over how great it was. Owner came out of kitchen to chat he and his wife were super nice too! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well I decided to give this place one more chance.  I am so glad that I did!  I had wings, pizza and salad to go.  I was not disappointed at all!  Everything that I ordered, was cooked perfectly and I didn't have to wait forever for it.  The sauce was so much better, such a major improvement.  I recall it was really bland, when I was there last in June. Found out that this place is under new management and I can tell!  Twisted Pies will be my 'go to' pizza joint!!!   A++"}
{"text":"Normally I give a 5 star here. This time my GF pizza was burnt, so they are replacing with a new pizza. Even this it is inconvenient to have to wait fir the redo,   The hostess was very apologetic.  I'm sure the 2nd pizza will be great!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have not been disappointed. Quality pizza with a right amount of chew to crunch ratio on the crust. Will definitely be heading back in the future."}
{"text":"The bomb!! The pizza was the best I ever had. The service was fast and efficient. Great place to go eat pizza!!!"}
{"text":"We had the Hawiian pizza and the BBQ pizza, slightly modified....Owner was very nice and accommodating to my needs. We started with the garlic knots which were delicious! Both pizzas were filling with lots of toppings."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The pizza was so good, and the small cozy atmosphere is perfect! Trust me, this place lives up to the reviews!"}
{"text":"I had to drive to get there but I was worth the drive! Pizza was very very good in fact it's hard to eat pizza any where else! Was one of the best iv had in a very long time. Up there with the 5 favs of mine! You guys have to try it then you will know what great pizza is!"}
{"text":"This excellent pizza is in a small strip mall. Highly recommended. The San Marzano sauce is one of the best pizza sauces I've had. We ordered the Meats pizza and the toppings are excellent. The whole family loved the pizza. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Just ok and blah.  No spices in sauce at all?  It was just all a bit bland.  $20 for 12\" veggie pizza (includes tax/delivery/tip).  After 20 years, I'm done trying to get a good pizza in Mesa.  From now on, I'm ordering Giordano's and having it shipped - a much better pizza and better value.  I can get 4 stuffed pizza's for $98 shipped.  One piece is a meal."}
{"text":"We want to give a shout out to twisted pies.  Thank you for your great food, delivery service and friend staff.  We love you guys."}
{"text":"Yummy! The dough is scrumptious, the toppings are abundant ( seriously, pepperoni the size of my fist and full slices of bacon) and the customer service is superb.  Can't help ourselves, we've ordered twice this week."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza! The crust had a good flavor and was a nice mix of crunchy outside and soft inside. The cheese in particular was delicious but there wasn't much of it. I would recommend recommend avoiding the carnivore though; there was so much meat we ended up taking half of it off... it really covers all the pizza flavor. That's completely our fault though. I didn't care for the sauce - it a was very plain tomato sauce, kind of chunky and watery. But some people dig that, so I won't knock it too hard.  Kind of pricey, and it took a while to cook - so probably a better place for dinner than lunch. Definitely not an optimal bang for your buck, but good. Staff was nice, but the place was pretty empty. The facility was clean, but seemed like it was built in a place that was never intended to be a restaurant - kitchen door was just a curtain and the soda fountain was rather out of place.   Would go again, but not very often."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times now and I love it. The food is amazing and the staff is wonderful. I have had it delivered as well and the time and quality of food was great. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is real pizza folks! They don't cut corners. fresh, authentic ingredients and truely authentic dough/crust. Very nice, friendly people too.  I can't remember the last time I had pizza this good. Really.  I'm driving over a hundred  miles for physical therapy and found this jewel on Yelp."}
{"text":"O. M. G!! I've died and gone to pizza heaven! We visited today for the first time and are in Love! The atmosphere is relaxed. The young lady working this afternoon (we went there about 2 pm) was so friendly and personable. It felt like we were eating at a friend's house!  We ordered 1/2 pound of boneless barbecue wings and a large supreme pizza. When I asked if we could leave off onions, she said, \"sure! Leave off, substitute, whatever you want.\" Very accommodating! The wings came out first. I had intended to just try one. Or two. After all, we also had pizza coming. But the wings were so good, we ate them all! Lol! Good thing we didn't order a pound!  The pizza was next. And that was so delicious that we ate 2 pieces each! Stuffed and happy, we went home with a half a pie, already planning our next order. The gal asked if we wanted to join their loyalty club, to earn rewards. Hell Yeah! All together, a Wonderful experience! If you want outstanding food, a friendly atmosphere, and superior customer service, look no farther! Thanks, Twisted Pies!"}
{"text":"Best wings in East Mesa! We were craving wings last night, found them on Yelp and ordered. Got bone-in and boneless, garlic knots and cheesy bread. Loved it so much we ordered again tonight! Got the special, 16 inch 2 topping and 1 lb wings for $22, plus added a medium deep fried pizza, just to try it. All of us agreed the wings are the best, especially with the Garlic Hot sauce. Will definitely order again!!!"}
{"text":"Found them on Yelp* this morning and decided to give them a try this afternoon.        First of all, they are very minimal, only been in business for 6 months and still making a go of it.  The Owner went out of her way to make sure that everything was great, it wasn't if you compare them to other restaurants.  Because they are so new and doing all the work themselves, I think they deserve the leeway.  They weren't busy when we walked in and another gentleman walked in after we ordered that had read an article about them 4 months ago.  I thought to myself that if people don't start coming to enjoy this place and help it get better that they might not have a chance to later.      Now for the food, The owner told us the meat and veggies are fresh cut daily, the flour and tomatoes are from Italy.  The deep fried pizza is for personal pizza's only to speed the process up for people that are pressed for time.  You might call it a personal pizza, but it was more than enough for me.  Some people compared it to an Elephant ear fluffy, I wouldn't say that at all.  I thought it was crispy and well cooked, Really liked it a lot!  We also had the wings, which were on the small size and not as crispy as I thought they would be.  Still good though.         I have to say that a small place like this is worth the effort, because you can see the effort the owners are putting into the place.  I'll be back and quite possibly make it a habit of mine!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for some good pizza tonight, and chose this place because of the rating.  I read they had crispy pizza, I love crispy burnt crust.  However the crust wasnt crispy, the crust was just thin,  and flimsy.  I was disappointed because I don't like flimsy pizza.  The taste of the pizza was just ok.  The employees were Nice and the service was good, I took the employees advice to order the perfect pepperoni pizza.  But if a pizza is flimsy, I'm not gonna like it.  So there you go."}
{"text":"This is very good pizza.  You have to have a certain type of oven to get the crust to come out this way."}
{"text":"Amazing food & service. stumbled upon this place on a whim and have been back several times now.  A Hidden Gem for sure. 5 stars all the way.."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Definately worth a try. All sorts of great combinations that are not usual"}
{"text":"Twisted Pies has the best pizza in Mesa!  The crust is perfectly crisp on the bottom, never soft and soggy. The mushrooms are fresh, pepperoni big around and thin sliced and the sausage is delicious."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is GREAT pizza!  I was really surprised, because I had never heard of this place and I get nervous trying new pizza places. But I can honestly say I will go nowhere else for pizza after this. The crust was PERFECT.  The sauce didn't overwhelm the toppings. The sausage crumbles were just right!  The toppings were in nearly every bite, and stayed on the pizza!  The delivery girl was very polite, neat and clean. (I often get grubby sweaty tattoo laden guys delivering my pizzas when I use big chain pizza.). Obviously I am quite pleased with this awesome pizza joint!  Try them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"great pizza!  Reminded us of back home in Western NY!  Rachel was conversational and informative as to the menu and restaurant and the pizza chef was so nice!  Definitely going back"}
{"text":"First timers. Pizza was great! Nice crust, delicious sauce, fresh toppings. Wings were ok. Staff was friendly but spread too thin. Atmosphere on the lower scale. Will definitely go back for pizza, but next time will carry out vs dinner in."}
{"text":"We liked it so much, we picked up a couple pizza to share with our family visiting from California!"}
{"text":"We order the family special which is a lot of food for the price. Their sausage pizza is crumbled and has a good flavor. The wings are nice and hot if you get any that are labeled hot. My only draw back is the pizza is kinda greasy on top and we have to pat it off. This place is worth a try! We still need to try the salad and calzones though!"}
{"text":"My family and me recently visited this location and must say while I rate the pizza at 5 stars the reason for the 3 is service is horrible here.   The Pizza; we went with an all meat kinda deal. The pizza had plenty of toppings and enough for 2 people to eat with leftovers.   The Crust; this crust had the perfect balance of a crispy outside and warm soft inside. The flavor to this crust brings out the flavors of the pizza toppings.   The fountain drinks are self serving.   Now to speak on the staff here while they all seemed kind, they had no clue what was going on. Part of my meal didn't even come and when I asked about it I was asked it I wanted it wrapped to go. I'll assume we were to eat our food with a napkin as they did Not bring out enough plates. Took awhile to get that plate.   ***They truly she advice person when ordering the the pizza are made fresh and that the wait time is longer!   I will try them again on a different day of the week."}
{"text":"Pizza wasn't all that great, ordered based on it being 5 stars and I'm not understanding the hype. Hard crust, chunks of tomatoes instead of actual sauce, cheese slides right off of the slice, and it looked generic. Wasn't too satisfied with the pizza! Most likely wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"Good pizza!  Fast delivery!  I wish they were open more often."}
{"text":"We are picky with our pizza! We have been here going on 7year and was introduced to The Twisted Pie a few months back and fell in love!! The flavor of there pizza is amazing. The wings are flavorful also. We had the Carnivore, Pesto, and Ham pizza all wonderful!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It gets better every time I go. Had the best cheese pizza tonight with wings."}
{"text":"We don't usually dine out in this area, so we used Yelp to find somewhere near my friends home.  We were originally looking for a full service restaurant but took a chance on this little place in the back of a strip mall.  We were served by Amos, who was very helpful and shared the specials for the evening.  When we asked for what we must have, he recommended the Pepperoni special. Fresh basil and Mozzarella with homemade sauce and a crispy crust made this unique.  We added dinner salads and garlic knots.    Nothing fancy, but we enjoyed the service and food.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We visited Twisted pies on a whim after reading yelp reviews. Without a doubt best wings in the area. We love the carnivore pizza with honey hot wings.  We have gone twice now and it just keeps getting better."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the East Valley! SOOOOOOO good. I always order way too much but can not help it."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try this evening based on the many 5 star ratings that we saw. To get the most important things out of the way, the pizza and wings were very good and deserve a high rating. The pizza was fresh and  light and not heavy like some other places. So it didn't settle hard in the stomach. And that was a good thing.   What was interesting is that the 12 inch pizza we got was almost packed with as much toppings as most other places put on their extra extra large. This thing had a ton of toppings and a minimal amount of sauce and maybe that's why it just had a lighter taste about it.  And that was a plus.  Now the next observation was that dining room is rather ran down but it is obvious this is an upstart business trying to get itself off the ground. So there were some considerations given for that. Although I would encourage the owners to take a look around and observe how many things that are out of place in the dining room. Such as why do you need to have an empty pretzel warming case next to the soda machine when you have nothing to put in it. Get that thing out of the dining room. Also you had a hodgepodge of  junk sitting around the front cash register station and none of that should be out on the floor. Also in someone else's  negative comment, they  noted you've got electrical cables spread out all over the place. That may be great in some man cave garage,  but this is a restaurant and it just makes the place look cluttered and amateurish.  Besides why haven't you taken care of that since the last negative review??   I would think it would be something you were concerned about if someone has already said something about it.  For those patrons that want to feel as though they're dining in a location that is clean and sanitary, your dining room does not give that impression by any stretch of the imagination.  We ALMOST turned around and left because of the condition of the place and wondered if the kitchen was just as bad. But we decided to support a local Mesa business and stuck it out.   I'm glad we did.   So this is a constructive comment for you as I DO want to see a fellow Arizona family succeed.  On a final note though the service was really good and even though you guys were struggling a bit in the kitchen to get your act together, you were apologetic and sincere about the issues. Might be a good idea to have incentive for when things go wrong like this, and offer up free Garlic twists or something as an apology for the wait. Just a little something that would add extra customer service.  It was great to see fellow Americans trying to get a small business off the ground. You have a terrific food product and now you just need to focus on a few of the perception issues.  Get those fixed and you'll be well on your way to running a first-class operation.    Let's support this place and help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!!   I know I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem on Main St. just east of Val Vista. I found them via the Five Stars app and wanted to give I a shot. The inside as well as the location had me a little skeptical but I am an advocate and supporter of small business plus the pictures online and the menu looked good and let's be honest who doesn't like pizza? The pizza was great and the owner is friendly. I definitely recommend this place and the Meats Pizza!"}
{"text":"The owner was very kind on the phone. He took the time to go over all my question and he even went the extra mile to deliver the pizza & wings himself!! Our first time trying Twisted Pies but definitely not our last!! We will be back for more"}
{"text":"Great pizza with even better customer service. The owner was so nice as was his employee. The pizza was delicious. Giant sized toppings, crunchy but chewy crust with a great sauce. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Super delicious & gluten free available! Very mellow & chill environment. If you're in the neighborhood definitely try this place. Love it!"}
{"text":"After taking the Grand Kids for a Laser Tag Birthday Celebration, we needed a Pizza. I don't like chain places. Their cheese never seems to have much flavor. So I looked on Yelp and found this gem.  The 5 of us got there just as they opened up, which was good with 3 rowdy kids under 10.  The only guy there was very accommodating with us being so early. He got us glasses for drinks and shortly after that he took our order. We went for the Saturday special. A 2 Topping Extra-Large and Wings. We got a Double Pepperoni. Amazingly they actually put on a bunch of Pepperoni for us. Covered the whole pizza. So many places charge you for dbl but you just never get enough do you. The kids loved it. But not nearly as much as I did. It was great. One of the best Pepperoni Pizza's I've had in years. We also had the Calamari Strips. They were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside and not fishes at all. The kids thought they were chicken. I like it like that. They could use a better dipping sauce. Something with more kick than a bland marinara. As for the wings, we took them home with the Honey Hot Sauce. I'm sure they were good when they were fresh because they were good cold,later that night. I'm sure I'll be back since I don't like the places real close to home."}
{"text":"Its been a while since me and the wife have been here, we decided to try a new one the stingin Hawaiian, let me tell you this thing is the best Hawaiian pizza I have ever had. It has this sweet spicy sauce that hits your taste buds like no other. I love the way the incorporated jalapenos in to this version.  Not sure what else is on this pizza as I ate it to fast to even look at it. Can't wait to try the next new thing here."}
{"text":"Got takeout here on Sunday after hearing about this place in the paper.  The pizza was phenomenal-we got a meat lovers and a supreme pizza.  The ingedients are super-fresh and flavorful, the crust is light and thin, with that slight little scorched edge, just the way we like it, and the sauce is light, allowing the ingredients to shine.  The cheese is just right, tasty but not overpowering.  They are clearly using high-quality ingredients.  And the wings (we got mild, and bbq) were fresh, juicy and very flavorful.    The owner (at least I assume he was) was very engaging and friendly with us and everyone else there, despite being very busy.  The dining room decor leaves alot to be desired, so for now we'll just do takeout.  We love it!"}
{"text":"Small place in an old Mesa strip mall. Very unassuming exterior. Seems clean inside. Pizza was very good, with a peppery sauce and good pepperonis. Dinner salad was fresh and crisp. Wings were not well sauced, almost dry. Maybe you need to ask for extra sauce. We would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here twice on UberEats and we love it! It is our new favorite pizza place! My husband loves the wings and I love the calzones and our son loves the pizza. You get a lot of food for the price!"}
{"text":"The reviews are correct- good food and good prices.  The service is fast. I like the variety of food on the menu. It is kid friendly.  The pizza is not greasy.  The garlic bread sticks are delightful."}
{"text":"Good pizza great price . Spicy Italians the bomb!!!Staff was friendly and served your self serve drinks. Will be back."}
{"text":"I had the meats pizza and it was very delish.  The crust was also crispy.  Will go there again."}
{"text":"My husband and I love trying out new pizza places. We have lived in the area for quite some time yet neither of us had ever been to Twisted Pies before. We arrived after dinner time so it wasn't too busy. We were able to pick which table we wanted to sit at and service was prompt. We ordered a pepperoni pizza. The owner brought it to our table himself and checked back on us to make sure everything was good. Fresh hot pizza, lots of napkins right at the table, and the door open to enjoy the wonderful January evening weather. My husband and I both agreed that we will be back to try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"Gave them 5 chances!!!! I really wanted to love this place the ingredients used are great but they messed up my delivery order 4 of the 5 times and the center of the pizza is always soggy and the toppings slide right off not to mention if you leave the pizza in the box for leftovers it sticks to the box pulling up the cardboard to the pizza!not worth the money!!! Bye bye"}
{"text":"We ordered two of the deep fried crust pies and my oh my where we pleasantly surprised. The crust kind of reminded me of the pizza crust version of a chalupa. They toppings were toasted just the right amount where the cheese had melted to a glorious golden brown.   I highly recommend this place it's tasty and amazing."}
{"text":"The quality of the pizza and service was amazing.. I will be back!!! The dough was made to perfection. Its a mom and pop so the service was personalized and warm."}
{"text":"Well, after one of the worst days of my life, I was subjected to staying in a motel that I will not mention near this pizza place. I was originally searching for my go-to Papa Johns but it was too far, so I decided to try out this pretty horribly named pizza place. The crust, the sauce, and the staff were unbelievably unbelievable. I was so stoked to find out about this joint! I ordered pizza and wings back to back days while at the motel that shall not be named. Hopefully, I persuade someone to do themselves a favor and try this place out."}
{"text":"My son and I visited the restaurant today.  We ordered a \"Meats\" pizza and some wings.  The food was prepared quickly and was absolutely delicious!  Fresh ingredients on the pizza were fantastic.  The chef recommended a combination of \"hot\" and \"BBQ\" sauce on the wings.  They were great.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Now I've never been to New York, but this pizza is so good. I was so happy they delivered!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because friends had recommended them.  I decided to have the items delivered.  I ordered the \"build your own pasta bowl \"; which I ordered with chicken, olives,peppers,tomatoes and sauce. I also ordered the oven baked boneless chicken and the italian salad.  When the order arrived,  I noticed I had 2 containers of chicken wings and NO pasta bowl.  I called Twisted Pies and advised them I did not receive the pasta bowl in my order.  They asked me if I wanted a refund.  I stated I wanted it delivered since that is what I ordered.  When the \"pasta bowl\" arrived, it was VERY small and had NO chicken.  I paid 10.00$ for a small bowl of pasta; equal to a small bowl of cheap soup , with a smear of tomato sauce and and Very few soggy mushrooms,peppers and olives.   Also, the \"baked chicken wings\" were a soggy, breaded fried mess.    I am VERY disappointed with this place.  I was not even compensated for a mistake they made! I would NOT recommend this place to anyone! I paid over 30$ for a meal I could have made better myself.   I have had better chicken from Mcdonalds, at least they would have been cheaper. ***** ***UPDATE: posted review 2/9/17, owner contacted me immediately.  He apologized the mistake and offered to make it up to me.  I am very impressed  with the concern and attempt to make things right.  This is what businesses are about.  I will look forward to trying the food again so I can make it a 5."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Never knew this restaurant even exist in the neighborhood! We are glad we tried. Definitely will go back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough! The ambience is kind of this mix between a little ceasars and Olive Garden (they were playing Italian music). The staff was delightful and the pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"This family owned local pizzeria is the best in town. The boneless chicken wings are huge, juicy, fresh and flavorful. The Carnivore pizza is amazing with a bianca sauce. Definitely will be coming back here over and over again."}
{"text":"I googled \"best pizza in east Mesa\". Twisted Pies was at the top of the list so I decided to give them a try. I'm so glad I did! The pizza is great.  The wings are phenomenal!  I've been back several times; can't seem to stay away from a sausage and mushroom pizza! The crust is not too think, very flavorful. The sauce is light, bright and not sweet or overpowering. Staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"I live in California & my sister lives in Mesa, I was super bummed the local Florist couldn't help me out with a last minute delivery for her Birthday....and then \"Light-bulb!\". I called Twisted Pizza and asked if they could help me with a surprise pizza deliver lol. They were super excited to help me and we successfully surprised her! Thank You All over At Twisted Pies!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  We LOVED this place.  Hubby is from Chicago an I am from Detroit---we know good pizza.  Lets start with the bottom....the crust:  perfect...not too doughy or yeasty.  Not too crisp or too thick.  Just......perfect.  Next---the sauce.  One bite, and you know that sauce is homemade.  Fabulous tomato flavor (from San Marzano tomatoes, the owner divulged) delicious flavor not hidden with a bunch of garlic, herbs, or sugar (I hate sugary pizza sauce!) the delicious flavor or quality tomatoes really comes thru in a spectacular way.  We ordered the Meat Lovers, which was very good, and still....the quality of the ingredients is what you taste. Pepperoni that does't give you heartburn! Yay! Finally....the cheese.  Oh, holy cow.....THE CHEESE.  That was the best cheese that I have ever had on a pizza. Quality ingredients all the way thru this pizza.  The wings were great....and made the way anyone from Buffalo can tell you: NO BREADING.  We had mild and BBQ.  Both yummy and lean.  You guys have GOT to try this place!"}
{"text":"We went back for the daily special which was an xl 2 topping pizza and a dozen wings. We had pepperoni with garlic. I was happy to find out that we weren't limited to one flavor for the wings. I had honey hot and my husband stuck with hot. Another great pizza."}
{"text":"Editing my review because we tried them again and they are the bomb!  All previous issues have been resolved and their pizza is DELICIOUS. *** Original review: I gotta give it a solid three stars because while the sauce and cheese were super yummy (chunks of tomatoes and you could taste the garlic!) half of both of our pizzas didn't seem to have hardly any sauce at all and the center of both the pizzas had really soggy crusts. But seriously, the parts of the pizza that had sauce and a solid crust were GOOD.***"}
{"text":"Loved the pie! This little hideout has the best pizza in Mesa...Neapolitan style with a really delicious crisp crust. I ordered the pizza and a salad (also delicious, and big!) through their website, and the details worked out perfectly. The order was 100% correct, and ready and hot when I walked in the door."}
{"text":"This place Is pretty good but the weak spot is quality control.  Ordered here maybe 20 times and if the owner is there you will get a very good pizza otherwise it just good. The wings are great but the mild med hot selection is a lottery. Depends on who makes them.  Still worth going though."}
{"text":"We decided to try this Twisted Pies because of the reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed. The pizza came out hot and topped with plenty of sausage and mushrooms. The owner (who also made our pizza) came out of the kitchen to greet us and to make sure everything was okay. Great customer service! While we were there, several repeat customers came in to either pick up an order or to eat in the dining room. That's a good sign of a good place."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place! They use high quality ingredients and you can tell they use love in their pizza making process. They are always friendly and the restaurant is very clean and inviting."}
{"text":"What can I say about Twisted Pies?  I wanted to love it, I honestly did.  After reading so many great reviews, I was expecting to be wow-ed by the food.  It was good, but not great.  Wings had a nice flavor, but didn't have enough sauce on them and were brought out with no celery or carrots.  I know, I know... that's not a deal breaker, right?  Of course not, but it was a little disappointing since I really like the veggies with my wings.  The pizza had good flavor, but the crust was chewy and quite tough.  I did enjoy the tomato sauce on the pizza though.  The dining room was really lacking, and there was a random table cloth covering something up next to the drink station.  When I got up to go to the bathroom, I nearly tripped on the table cloth because it was just draped over this weird thing.  All in all, I might try it again, but I'm not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Get the bacon cheeseburger pizza! It's awesome! It may sound questionable with the ketchup and mustard but it works. This is our new favorite pizza place. The service is fantastic, the owners make you feel right at home. The wings are great too, not breaded, plenty of meat, sauce, and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight on National Pizza Day and what a treat! We had the perfect pepperoni twisted pie with added mushrooms and green peppers. It was delicious. The crust is exceptional- crispy and chewey too. Very fresh ingredients. Best mushrooms I've ever had on a pizza. The garlic knots were delicious too. Not too garlicky and great texture. This was a hit just like all of the reviews I read beforehand suggested. Staff was very personable and accommodating. We'll be back"}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent! We tried the wheat crust and it was WAY good. The spicy Italian sausage was a perfect addition to the pepperoni, sausage and bacon pizza we ordered and the homemade pizza sauce was perfect. Everything was fresh and feels/tastes like it's all made from scratch - which it is. I loved it and my two boys (8 years and 4 years) loved it. Very friendly staff and a nice comfortable/casual place to eat. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place is so good!! Local business run by a super nice guy who's always great and friendly. I'm visiting the area but Im originally from Chicago, so I'm pretty picky about my pizza, and this pizza is top notch!! Perfect fluffy crust , big pepperonis golden cheese!! Yum"}
{"text":"Having visited several times a year, we have yet to find good pizza in Mesa. Coming from the Chicagoland area we have high expectations  I went for take out from Twisted Pies and held my breath. It's \"Bostonian Style\" so I didn't know what to expect. We were finally happy with our order...sweet sausage, mushroom and pepperoni. My only suggestion is a bit longer cook in the middle, but it's far above any we have tried in 11 years without driving far. Thank you   We will return next time out.  PS The Tiramisu was the kicker!!"}
{"text":"I used to work at the Old Godfather's Pizza in Tempe when I was a teenager. It's been a hard time finding a place comparable. Mike and Rachel fill that void!  Best kept secret in Mesa!   It's worth the drive! Small and family oriented. Great place for an intimate dinner or a group of friends. Check them out! You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  People are very nice and the food is out of this world.  You get a great bang for your buck.  Portions are on the plentiful side as well.  It's nice to find a local place with better food than the chains.  Will definitely come back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. Been there many times.  I had the meat lovers type pizza. The toppngs are always great."}
{"text":"First time to try. Decided to try it because we didn't want to drive anywhere for dinner after being in the car 45 minutes coming home from work and found on Eat24 the deliver. Gluten free pizza was great! Order was perfect. Still hot when we got it. Delivery lady was super nice. Pizza sauce tasted amazing and homemade. Gonna order again."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and we've already had this place twice! It is so delicious!  Tried the sweet and spicy with deep fried crust!  Omg!!!! Yum!  I can tell this place will be one of our favorites!!! I love supporting local mom and pop places!!  My only complaint is we are too far away for delivery!  I guess that might be a good thing!"}
{"text":"I really don't come on here often to write a review, unless I really enjoy it or really hate it even... But this is a really love it review!! My husband and 2 little girls came here last night. We just moved and we're looking for a new pizza place in the area. We were thinking of going to Barro's actually because that's one of my favorite pizza places, but aren't too fond of how expensive it can get. My husband found this place on Yelp and it's not super close to us but with the good reviews it was worth venturing out a couple more miles then just our neighborhood choices (which are whack by the way.) I won't lie I was skeptical at first, judging by the complex this place is in because there's nothing appealing in this older run down strip mall. Upon walking in we were warmly greeted by whom I'm assuming is the owner. He always had a smile on his face and was very courteous and friendly. We were happy about the wing Wednesday deal because we are always looking for good deals and love wings with our pizza. We ordered honey hot wings and a 14in pizza wth pineapple and bacon. Everything came out piping hot and fresh! Everything was delicious. The bacon was some huge fatty pieces of real bacon on there. The wings, where they do this deep fry ten bake thing is on point! Even my 6 year old who won't eat \"spicy\" wings devoured one and wanted more. My only complaint (literally) was the cups of ranch needed to be filled up more. We got 2 nice size cups at first but they were barely half full. I love ranch with my pizza and wings and so does my husband. We asked for 2 more and they were then smaller cups sow what filled up but I needed up finishing my ranch and still needing more but we didn't want to be annoying and ask for more ranch just for one more wing and a couple bites of pizza. So fill up those ranches and when we say extra ranch, were pretty serious about it lol! Last, (and saving the best for last) the sauce on the pizza was so delicious! He told me it is homemade and boy could I tell!! Im not even one to notice something like this either but I'm obsessed with the sauce. I'm wanting to go back to try their spaghetti now! We're definitely new fans of this place and will be bringing many more family and friends here!"}
{"text":"JT and I checked our Yelp for Pizza recommendations and this pizzeria popped up with good reviews, so we ordered take out: half order of boneless wings with medium sauce and 16 inch meat pizza. Boneless wings were ok, but pizza was superb. Good recommendation for pizza in Mesa. Fast service, easy in and out."}
{"text":"Little cozy pizza parlor hidden in a strip mall that is worth the hunt. First of all the people are super nice! And second but most importantly the pizza is delicious!  For me it's all about the sauce and they scored big point in my book! It made the pizza sweet and tasty! They don't skimp on the toppings either. Although it was only a 2 topping, it was loaded. Yum!   I also tried the wings and they where delicious. Not to saucy and nice and crispy. I can't wait to go back and try some of their Twisted pizza combination, they sounded amazing."}
