{"text":"This place is very cute and the staff are very helpful! Came here to try their specialty bingsoo, and it did not disappoint! The ice is shaved very finely so it doesn't even feel cold, and the proportions were good for a dessert size for 1-2 people. Good ratio of toppings as they mixed in with the shaved ice.

This place loses a star for price however, as one bowl was around $10 for a small size. Pretty pricey!"}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and enthusiastic and the entire cafe has a chill atmosphere. I would recommend the mango bingsoo or the injeomi bingsoo. During my first visit, I ordered the mango bingsoo but I had to wait for a bit over half an hour before receiving my order. Nonetheless, we got freshly sliced mango :)"}
{"text":"As a foodie I don't generally don't visit the same restaurant twice, but Snow Time is one of those places that keeps me coming back. Snow time is the best thing that ever happened in this plaza. Their shaved ice is absolutely perfect.  If you're ever wandering what to get for dessert this is the place to go.  The texture of the shaved ice and the toppings were perfect.  Hands down the best shaved ice I've had.  They even go the extra mile and put toppings on the bottom of the bowl.  This place does get a little bit crowded on the weekends though as the place is quite small. Must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great. Pretty small place, gets pack really quick"}
{"text":"i came to snow time ordered regular size take out Injeomi bingsoo on last week in the evening. I saw 3 to 4 customers who ordered first and then I asked the counter girl how long take the time do I need waiting for. She said around 20 minutes this was fine. But the actual time waiting around almost 40 minutes. Basically, the time making this dessert around 10 to 13 minutes for each.  Even though, taste is not bad. The time making very slow this is fail."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my sister tonight and in all honesty there was nothing to be impressed by. We came in at 8:30 pm and our order wasn't ready until 9:20 about a 50 min wait for bingsoo and we weren't the only ones. If you go here be ready to wait an hour for ur food which I dont understand how long it takes to make shaved ice. The bingsoo when we got it was good but not worth the price of 13 dollars nor the wait. I would have rather gone to cafe bene or the cups for cheaper and faster service. The one thing that irritated me was that all the girls working there did not understand or see a problem with making customers wait that long; they were apologetic or anything plus some of the girls were just standing around cleaning spoons or fixing their hair. Dont think I'm going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Well I know nothing goes as planned but they've been closed very frequently given how long they've been operating ... sucks to show up and realize you gotta change your plans. Call ahead of time in case there's some workplace safety issues and they're closed lol. Also I noticed that the quality of the dessert has gradually gone done since my last review and I've visited a handful of times since then."}
{"text":"Cozy caf√© atmosphere and great service. You order at the counter, either to go or to dine in and a buzzer will notify you when your order is ready. 
It was about a 30 minute wait for a seat because of the limited space. You can watch Korean music videos or TV shows while you wait for a seat. 
Bingsoo was a decent size and tasted good but was on the pricier side. Overall, would go back to try some of their other flavours!"}
{"text":"Food 4/5 
- portion was small and its quite pricey. Ordered oreo shaved ice and matcha red bean shaved ice which cost $21. They are decent and pretty good tho. 
Service 0/5
- Were asked to leave because of the lineup.. we just finished the last bite and the server immediately took away our bowls. Several tables next to us have finished already and been chatting for a while and the server didnt take away their bowls and didn't asked them to leave. I am 100% sure we came later than them. 0 customer service. Were given a 10% coupon while asking us to leave. Thanks but no thanks cause no more next time. Go to the Cups or Soul cafe."}
{"text":"Consistent Shaved Ice. Always Busy. A bit confusing when you first come in as there are lines of people waiting and you don't know whether to go to the front of the line and ask for seating or just wait, please do the former! (there is only one really nice worker here - assume she is the manager. She is the only one who acknowledged my existence haha)

I personally love the oreo bingsoo and it ranges from 11-14 dollars. Really enjoy the finely milled shaved ice but the ratio for topping to ice is lacking by the end LOL. Wait time is long, but my favourite worker always apologizes so its fine and understandable as it is made to order. I like the system of paying first then getting your order."}
{"text":"Ordered a small Matcha Red Bean (milk ice version). There are two matcha ones, one with matcha ice and red bean topped with matcha icecream. This one is milk ice with matcha powder, mochi, red bean, almond slices. Pretty good! Nice texture and loved the crunchy almonds and chewy mochi. They were nice ro give extra condensed milk in case we want it sweeter. We were fine with the sweetness..soothing dessert."}
{"text":"This was my third time coming to Snow Time. They had recently closed and undergone some menu changes and this was my first time back. I was extremely disappointed. Their chicken used to be so light and fluffy but they've changed the batter. Their previous batter was so unique that I used to go just for the chicken. The chicken batter is now dense and just so typical like American chicken. It just doesn't justify $11 chicken when Popeyes would be much cheaper. I hope they change their batter back in the future. 

Their bingsuu's ice used to be very sweet and flavorful but now it's flavorless like actual ice. The things that set Snow Time apart from other bingsuu/dessert places just aren't there anymore after the recent changes.


Based on the menu changes, unfortunately, I will probably not return."}
{"text":"Super busy so expect to wait for a table. They offer a variety of shaved ice options from matcha, to strawberries to mango. We decided to get a small mango one and it was the perfect amount for after dinner dessert. Wished they layered some more mango chunks and mango syrup in the middle. Sorta pricey for the amount you get."}
{"text":"Tried the Oreo bingsoo and it was good. It's a novelty thing to try but not a second time thing. Atmosphere was great. Comfy and cute stuffed animals and k-pop on TV"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place! They offer a small selection of shaved ice. We tried the matcha and pineapple shaved ice. The matcha one had a nice airy taste to it. Unfortunately , the pineapple one tasted like cough syrup. Overall a decent place for Korean shaved ice"}
{"text":"Snow Time is literally a snow dessert, it's not like your usual shaved ice, it really tastes like snow. It tastes soft and different in a good way. This is a must try on a hot day. However one person cannot finish one order by themselves. I really enjoyed the matcha shaved ice. It's very busy and the line can get long because there's only so many tables and the wait for the food is a bit long. It's self serve so they give you a buzzer. The only reason I gave them four stars is because they're not always open...but apparently that one incident was because they didn't have a certain part to their machine. They're a new business, so give them a try - the dessert is worth it. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered a large injeolmi bingsoo. It was something different and pleasantly enjoyable. You get a buzzer that vibrates when your order is ready!"}
{"text":"My second time eating bingsu and it has been the best yet!

I could actually taste the milk in the bingsu! My first bingsu was from Cups and the bingsu just tasted like snow - not much taste. I love the creamy milk taste of the bingsu here.

We tried the injeomi bingsu and there is the perfect amount of toppings for the amount of bingsu. There are also mochi pieces buried within! 

On the other hand, prices are a little steep. Over $10 for a large Injeomi bingsu. Keep in mind this is just ice cream with some toppings. I would come back but only once in a while."}
{"text":"The management staff here lovely. They have wonderful customer service. There was a misunderstanding, but they went out of their way to resolve it. Really appreciated the manager who turned a sour situation into a positive one. I'll be a loyal customer recommending all my family and friends here now! Raving about the great food and service.

The bingso here is definitely the best! Better than the ones in North York (k-town). Seating is a bit small, but I would definitely recommend coming here. You can always grab take out! I would recommend coming a bit earlier because it seems they are so popular they can run out of stock on their items. I will definitely come back and be a regular. I had the Oreo bingso and it's already become one of my favourites!! It also comes with a side condensed milk too! 

It looks like they also have some snack menus coming soon to their menu so keep your eyes out for that too!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! (despite their comic sans font logo)

Right when you enter you are greeted with a warm welcome. \"Annyeonghaseo! Do you speak English or Chinese?\" Thought that was pretty funny. 

I came here on a Sunday around 10PM and to my surprise the place was full. But we managed to get a table shortly after.

We ordered a regular sized Matcha Redbean Bingsoo and a Mixed Fruit Bingsoo. Both of them looked and tasted great but I definitely liked the Mixed Fruit Bingsoo more (because it was more aesthetic and I'm all about the aesthetics). Unfortunately they ran out of mango but they told us they could pour mango sauce on it.

I've tried bingsoo at other cafes before but Snow Time just does it better. Usually when you get to the middle, it starts to taste bland but Snow Time  layers their bingsoo so that every bite tastes great!

Overall, staff was really friendly, honest, and helpful. Most importantly, their bingsoos are bomb. I haven't tried their other items but I will definitely be back to try them!

Thanks for making me fat, Snow Time :)"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place, fun and clean. I had the mango shaved ice, man, it was like the best shaved ice I have ever had. They put so many mango chunks you can basically eat two for each and every bite. Gotta give this place a try!"}
{"text":"There's no time like snow time! Fun little spot. 

Food: 4/5 Yummy shaved ice.
Service: 4/5 Fast and friendly.
Environment: 4/5 Modern. Nice decorations.
Washrooms: 4/5 Clean. Individual.
Worth it?: 4/5 Great to share.

Came in here with a group of 10 for dessert. We were super lucky to have showed up when we didn't. We were able to get a big time right away. There is always a line up at this location. I would suggest going early (6-7 pm) if you looking for a larger table. 

I shared the small shared ice between two. I think that's a good size. We got the Mango Bingsoo. There was allot of mango and it was very refreshing. I highly recommend it. 

They have many \"coming soon\" items. I still think I will still to their best sellers but would like to see how things pan out!"}
{"text":"Cute decor and yummy desserts - what more can you ask for!!! My friend and I came here on a weekday and it was super busy (not to mention this was in the middle of October too) - which might explain why people spend hours in here even though they've finished their dessert.

We got the regular sized injeolmi bingsoo and the peach bingsoo. If you ever come here and are unsure of which bingsoo to get - try the injeolmi one, as that's considered the classic flavour. 

Both of the bingsoo were flavourful and full of toppings. It wasn't super sweet as we expected it to be & didn't melt fast. We loved the fact that the injeolmi wasn't hardened from the cold and was super chewy! It also included red bean, shaved almonds, and soybean powder. Although I don't usually like red bean, I actually enjoyed it in the bingsoo. 

As for the peach, it was a little on the sour side but a great transition from the sweetness of the injeolmi bingsoo. It included peaches, vanilla ice cream, peach syrup, and of course the shaved ice. They didn't cheap out on the peaches but it would've been more enjoyable if they added some other toppings. 

It's definitely the perfect dessert to share!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for date night and it was packed! There was a line that went all the way out the door and the mango bingsu was sold out. We ordered the mix fruit bingsu which was very good and had chunks of mango in it. When bingsu first came to Toronto, one thing that really annoyed me was the fact that the shaved ice used was the same type of ice as a snow cone which was very chunky and didn't retain any flavour. I like how Snow Time used more finely shaved ice and had fruit mixed into the ice. Would definitely come back for moaaar :D"}
{"text":"Best bing su in Toronto especially compared to Cups and Dear & Fro. I had the Injelomi. I am only giving this 4 stars based on the physical store- walked in and immediate foul smelling odour like feet? The place wasn't dirty but not sure what the small was. It was bearable but of course bothersome. I did takeout. The environment and atmosphere can not compare to Cups & dear & fro. Much more lively and welcome at those places. But the actual bingsu here tastes the best, perfectly layered and perhaps it was the red beans that I normally don't get at other places that adds to the flavour. They perfectly layered everything and getting take out didn't seem to ruin or melt any of the shavings or toppings. The bowls are also the largest for the price. I would recommend coming here but I wouldn't suggest it if you're looking for a place to sit down and mingle for a longer period of time"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go try out this place. We ordered the mixed fruit bingsoo and the injeomi toast and overall it was really good. The bingsoo came with condensed milk for people who like it extra sweet. But the toast was a little too sweet for me. The people working there were really nice and helpful. I'd definitely come back here, even in the winter."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Saturday night and it the line up was obviously long. I think we waited 30 minutes or more. You have to wait in line for a table and then go up front to order and then pick it up. We shared the injeomi, and both loved it. The ice kind of reminds me of coconut flakes and was super smooth. The mochi really added texture to it and the whole thing wasn't too sweet. Staff was helpful and friendly and I'm sure I will come back to try the other flavours. They all look good!"}
{"text":"The place and location is good, is easy to find. The dessert is ok but is just so disappointing of the price, the price is high and there's not a thing in the menu. I like coco, I know the bubble tea is different form the dessert but they always have new stuff in the menu"}
{"text":"My favorite bingsu in Toronto so far... I loved the freshness of the ingredients and they definitely don't cheap out on loading every bowl with fruits and almonds. Will definitely come back. Very comparable to the bingsu we had in seoul"}
{"text":"Very nice selection of different tropical shaved delightsservice was abit off wasn't sure if We had to wait to be seated so we had to ask the counter worker, who seemed to be the only one working outside???and the wait was pretty long too???but other than that the food was really good"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place since it opened.
Nice spot for some korean shaved ice.

When we went into the restaurant, it was pretty crowded.
There were not much seatings available, so quite a few people had to stand and wait for seats

They have about 6 different types of shaved ice.
We had the green tea with rice cake and the mixed fruit shaved ice.

Overall the shaved ice is decent, however i feel like there is not enough sauce / fruits once you get the the bottom of the dessert."}
{"text":"Best Korean shaved ice place. A little pricer than others. Service is a little slow and can improve a bit more."}
{"text":"This place is rated pretty high and I've seen pictures of this place on instagram so I thought it'd be cool to give it a try. I was expecting something like cha time shaved ice but it was nothing similar. The prices were way more expensive than I expected for the portion size. The different flavours just references the toppings but I'm pretty sure all the ice cream flavours are just plain. Around $10-11 including tax for each bingsu. In my opinion, it's only worth it to go once...maybe. Would probably not go again."}
{"text":"Terrible service and the staffs were rude. They skipped my order and I ended up waiting over an hour for my Mango Bingsu, which had already melted when I got it."}
{"text":"Been here several times with friends and after trying another shaved ice place this one is not as comparable as that one. Decided to try something new this time and got a large choco banana shaved iced. There were only a few chocolate and bananas pieces so we when reached halfway into the dessert, we ended up just eating flavourless shaved ice. We were a bit disappointed that it was not layered with at least chocolate sauce in the middle so that it wouldn't be just plain. Will stick to the usual Oreo or matcha red bean here."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

Recently opened and serving up Korean shaved ice desserts, I came here after trying Cups a week ago so that I could get a comparison between the two.

Ordered the Injeomi Bingsu which came with milky shaved ice, almonds, rice cakes and peanut powder. As well there is condensed milk on the side for you to pour over. I particularly liked the milky flavour that is immersed into the shaved ice. It was significantly creamier and more delectable than Cups overall.

Depending on the lineups I think the average wait time for an order is around 15 minutes. It took around 30 minutes for mine as it was a full house when I went with many other orders in the queue.

Service was great despite the wait. They do provide buzzers to let you know when your order is ready. Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Love the shaved ice at this place because they pack it with so much flavour. Each cup is also filled over the top! Definitely my go to spot for bingsu."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. The Bingsoo is delightful. We had Mango and Pineapple. First time trying it. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food but how Snow Time conducts business. The pricing on the menu is $10.99 for a Land on display it's $11.99 but we were charged $12.49. They did not provide a receipt until we asked. When we pointed out the price discrepancy they did not honour the shown price. So does that mean you can label what you want and charge something else? 

It's not about nickel and diming here, it's about honesty and what's right. If you want to charge a higher price then label it that way so I have a choice to purchase or not. You can't just display a price then charge something else. I wonder how many people actually got a receipt and then checked it and how many people they cheated."}
{"text":"This store is located at the third plaza in midland & finch,  parking in weekdays is fine. It is not a really big store though. The bingsoo is taste good. We try the regular size injeolmi one with rice cake, red bean and yellow bean power. Worth to have a try."}
{"text":"Came here after lunch one day with the kiddies. First time here, cute concept with cute displays and little stuff animals you can play with. The wall could be a little cuter but thats a different topic. Upon entering I was given a buzzer and a menu however it wasnt explained to me that I had to order at the register so I sat there waiting to give me order for a few minutes. It was after self discovery that I realized I had to go up there. We ordered the mixed fruit bingsu in the regular size.. so equivalent to a medium? I shared that with myself and 2 kids so it was perfect portions. Everything was cut up nicely and tasted good! They also have fake displays of the Bingsu so you can reference to size which I found helpful."}
{"text":"Dessert is always on my list whenever I'm going out to eat, and bingsu (Korean shaved ice) is definitely in my top 3. It's light, smooth, and has a variety of flavours depending on how risky you're feeling.

We ordered two of their bestsellers: Matcha Green Tea & Injeolmi (Korean rice cake, glutinous rice flour, roasted soybean powder). The shaved ice is soooo smooth and fine, it melts in your mouth.

Matcha is a classic bingsu flavour. It's creamy, milky, and has the right amount of sweetness. They even top it off with a small scoop of matcha ice cream, which is always a good idea.

Injeolmi on the other hand may not be for everyone, but its unique flavour was what made me keep taking bite after bite after bite. It reminded me of roasted rice tea, a very soothing and earthy taste.

Snow Time is definitely a place where you and your friends can satisfy your sweet tooths, try new and exciting flavours, and catch up over heating bowls of shaved ice."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS FUCKIN LIT. 

Super fluffy and not too sweet. A bit lacking in toppings but the quality of the dessert makes up for it.

Injeolmi bingsoo boiz..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Oreo bingsu, order took a long time and it was really cold in there. The bingsu came in a large potion, with shaved ice and Oreo shavings on top. There were too much oreo, so after a short while you'll just be eating shaved ice."}
{"text":"Went today after lunch. I had patbingsu in downtown before but I think snowtime definitely nailed it with the homo based milk snow rather than ice. I picked the mango one and was all very sweet. The display matched the real product which was very nice to see. Would definitely go again in the summer when it's hotter."}
{"text":"Came here with friends a few nights ago looking for a small dessert to share and we got a matcha bingsu with mochi - I would highly NOT recommend it. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong one but the matcha bingsu was disproportionately flavoured and the entire design of it was poor. They provided condensed milk on the side to pour atop the bingsu but because it was volcano-shaped with no room to actually hold the milk, it just landslided off. The base of the dessert was entirely unflavoured shaved ice -merely topped with matcha powder. Since the matcha wasn't nicely infused into the ice, I ended up just having alternative mouthfuls of either powdery bitter matcha or watery flavorful-less ice. Then there's the sharp contrast of the super sweet red bean to keep the dessert from tasting like nothing. The overall flavours of all the ingredients didn't marry well. 

That being said, I noticed the other menu options are actually infused shaved ice so maybe they're better. I don't know. I'm still not inclined to come back considering I didn't find the portion was worth the price."}
{"text":"A cute little place for shaved ice or bingsoo - good to spend a bit of time after dinner when the night feels too young still. Cute pillows create a cozy environment, however flavour-wise there's a lot more out there I'd like to try!"}
{"text":"I have seen this in the area for a while and decided to stop in for a snack with the wife last week.

We had a red bean and matcha shaved ice, medium size and a cappuccino.   Presentation was nice with extra condenced milk on the side if you want it a bit sweeter.  Flavour was pretty good, decent portion size and nice layers of red bean and matcha.  A nice size for sharing.  Cappuccino was pretty good as well, nice taste, no need for any extra sugar or anything especially accompanied with a sweet dessert.

Staff was friendly and helpful.  Would definately go back to try the mango version which looked delicious."}
{"text":"Finally, they were back from vacation! This is my third time visited Snow Time. Why do I post my review this late? Because I just tried other shaved snow ice places and I want to compare them all. Snow Time is currently #1 on my list for shaved snow ice.

I have tried Match, injeomi, mango and mixed fruit flavors. I love the Real Fruit Bingsoo, very smooth and soft and not too sweet. It is really hard to tell from photos that it has layers (not just a bowl of ice and topping on top). This place is nice and cozy. The staffs were friendly.

I will come back and try the other flavors."}
{"text":"One of my fav bingsu place for korean shaved ice! Usually really busy! Good quality on ingredients & good presentation. Have tried many other bingsu places such as CUPs and this place surpasses other ones ive tried. Great cold refreshing dessert on a hot summery day"}
{"text":"This place can get very busy! We did take out instead because of the long wait to be seated. 

We ordered the matcha and it has mochi, red beans, almond slices, rice cakes and condense milk (more condense milk on the side). The shaved ice is fluffy (unlike Taiwanese style where it's more chunky) and you can taste the milk in the shaved ice! I'm not a fan of red bean but overall the flavour combination is yummy!

They ran out of mango when we went (weekend evening). Shareable desserts and I would come back to try their others flavours!"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm a little speechless right now.  My heart rate is skyrocketing from a harmonious combination of excitement and simple carbs.  The bingsoo (Korean shaved ice) here is top-tier, or at least from what I've had throughout my years in Toronto.  

I arrived here around 9:30pm on a Sunday with a small party of three (myself included).  The restaurant has a small square footage like most of the establishments in the Midland and Finch area.  Still, at this time of the night, one or two tables would usually be free for any new clients, but it was a different case at Snow Time.  The joint was packed with customers!  I could tell that the managers had arranged the tables in a way that would maximize the number of people they could serve at any given time, but, ultimately, a constant line-up is a reality here.  To enhance their traffic control, I believe they are even opening up another Snow Time branch in the same plaza (there is construction going on opposite to this one).  Nevertheless, a constant line-up is a good sign that they have quality desserts, especially since Snow Time hasn't been marketed profusely in the same way that Uncle Tetsu has been.

Although we were a small party, we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated.  The service is efficient and the workers communicate well and promptly.  While you wait, they even encourage you to peruse their menu so that you can get a sense of what to order ahead of time.  Unfortunately, they were out of mangoes when we checked in, as it's a popular summertime topping.  We opted for the Injeomi Bingsoo instead, which is shaved ice topped with roasted soy bean powder, red bean paste, almond flakes, and mochi bits.  Part of our reasoning behind this was the fact that this variation is considered by different accounts to be \"more traditional\", \"the original\", and what have you.  I've had injeomi bingsoo at other establishments before, so it was a great opportunity to compare the quality - and I was blown away!  

The workers didn't skimp on the toppings, so every bite was a paradise of creamy ice, soft and sweet red beans, chewy mochi, and crispy almonds, all of which were enveloped by the mellow roasted undertones of the soy bean powder.  When you order this, the workers also give you a side of condensed milk, an addition that I never experienced at other Korean dessert places in the GTA when I ordered bingsoo. My Korean partner and his cousin noted that having condensed milk on the side to add extra creaminess and sweetness to your bingsoo is the norm.  Therefore, I applaud Snow Time for this!  The condensed milk acted like a binding agent in my opinion, melding together the flavours of all the ingredients within the bingsoo while giving it an extra kick.  Hey, it may cost you several hundred extra calories, but it's far better than just tasting milky ice pellets - even if the milk in their ice pellets also seem higher in quality! 

Portion-wise, both the regular and large come mountain-topped. I would say that the regular is great between two people and the large is great for a party of three to four, that is unless you're a big eater!  The prices are 1-2 dollars more expensive than their competitors, but their sizes are also more generous, so the price to portion ratio evens out to what you would normally see elsewhere in the GTA.  My Korean bf's cousin, who just flew in from South Korea, even admitted that the bingsoo here has the same quality as what she's had in South Korea throughout her teenage years.  We all thoroughly enjoyed the bingsoo and left feeling quite elated over this new gem!  Therefore, given the higher quality that you can receive here, I would implore any dessert aficionado to come here for bingsoo.  

Plus, if desserts aren't exactly your cup of tea, then you can at least have the luxury of taking selfies with all the oversized plushies that are themed after KakaoTalk mascots. 

NOTE 1:  If you order the Injeomi Bingsoo, don't breathe when you dig in.  Otherwise, the soy bean powder will get caught in your throat and nose!

NOTE 2:  According to my Korean bf and his cousin, you add the condensed milk after eating away most of the soy bean powder from the top of the Injeomi Bingsoo. Otherwise, the condensed milk will just combine with the layer of powder, making it difficult to mix with the rest of the bingsoo.   Also, add the condensed milk in intervals in-between eating layers of the bingsoo to ensure there will be an even distribution."}
{"text":"My favourite korean dessert place so far.

Food: AMAZINGG. I had the MANGO BINGSU and man-oh-man the mango pieces are so fresh! And the \"snow\" is very light, flaky, and milky :) Love it. The entire dessert isn't overly sweet either which is great, and if you like it sweeter they give you condensed milk on the side.

Price (4/5): The reason why I deducted one star is due to it being pretty expensive in comparison to the portion size they give you (and comparing it to other Korean dessert places).

Service: Staff is polite and friendly. If you go as a pair you can get a seat pretty quick, but if you're in a group then prepare to wait."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Never had this kind of dessert before and it was interesting, still don't have a real opinion on it. The girl gave me an extra scoop of green tea ice cream though because of the wait."}
{"text":"Saw pics of their snow ice creations on instagram so decided to check it out. Even at 11pm on a Sunday night it was still pretty full. 

Decided to get the large oreo bingsoo for 11.95 to share. They give you a little buzzer to notify you when your food is ready. I waited around 20mins... which is kind of long for shaved ice. It had me wondering how intricate the dish could be. When i got it it looked really cute and the oreo crumbs were meticulously packed all over the surface. It looked like a cupcake! 

As for the taste, well... its ice with oreo crumbs and condensed milk. It didnt taste bad or anything but the only toppings for the dish are the ones you can see lol... so dig past the exterior and you get just plain old, not flavoured ice. 

The large is more than enough for two people because you get kinda sick of it in the end. Im not saying I was expecting something else by ordering bingsoo, I just wish the ice was flavoured in some way or there were toppings put in between the mountain of ice so that itd be more enjoyable to eat. 

The staff was friendly, the decor was also really pretty. Will I come back? Maybe on a super hot summer day where stuffing my face with ice is the only form of relief."}
{"text":"I've came to Snow Time multiple times in the past and the service has been solid.  However, tonight when I visited with friends, the girl that was working hid herself away in the backroom/kitchen (?).

Seeing the \"Please ring the bell if no one is up front\", I rang the bell and the girl came out.  She had the strangest glare on her face and slowly said \"I cannot serve you now\" and put the bell away and walked back to the backroom/kitchen (?)

This is especially unprofessional considering:

1) there was no line and majority of the existing customers had their orders.

2) it was 2 hours before closing time.  If it was 30 minutes , I can understand.  But 2 hours, come on!

3) why have the bell if you get upset when someone rings it? How about just not leave your customers unattended? 

Considering how there are tons of other options around the plaza, we just walked somewhere else.  The owner should really consider more consistent training.  

Your staff turning away customers is not the best business practice."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place for bingsu!! Ever since I heard about this place, I've been coming every other day.

Among all their flavours, I would highly recommend their mango and matcha. The mango is super juicy and sweet!! They're also super generous with the toppings, always full of flavours. There are layers of toppings throughout the bowl so you don't have to worry about running out of flavours half way. Some flavours also comes with condensed milk on the side so you could adjust the level of sweetness to your preference. 

One downside is that they're always packed... but everyone's relatively considerate and tries to leave as soon as they finish. 

Definitely will be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"What I was expecting wasn't what I got and that's my fault. I may be showing my age here but when my friend told me we were getting Korean shaved ice I was thinking Korean shaved ICE CREAM. We ordered the matcha greenbean regular size to share. It was a decent sized portion and there was matcha and red bean on top with almond slices and a side of condensed milk to pour over top. As I excitedly grabbed the desert with my spoon  and ate it I realized, I'm eating water. Literally it's frozen water shaved with some toppings on top. Don't get me wrong the toppings were good but I'm literally eating ice. My bad, I caused my own disappointment thinking of get ice cream. It's a good one time try for the experience for sure, but I wont be trying Korean shaved ice again. Also, their system for seating is kind of flawed and not clear when you first walk in (especially when it's busy)."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the matcha bingsoo here. Unlike other ones I've tried, the bingsoo here seems like it's shaved from green tea ice cream? It was creamy and very pleasantly sweet. The red bean and ice cream also went well together. The bowl it came in was icy cold and helped prolong the ice. Really good!"}
{"text":"Bingsoo!! Yess!! If you ever make a trek out to Scarborough, Snow Time is a really great dessert option. Bingsoo (Bingsu..? sp?) is Korean shaved ice dessert and there are various types you can order. I opted for the Injeolmi one which is with little rice cakes, red bean, served with a side of condensed milk. I think this one is their signature as well. Super tasty! The shaved ice was perfectly shaved extremely thin, and it was just the most marvelous icy dessert I ever had. I also had a matcha latte to go with it, but the star of the show was the bingsoo. 

When I had gone, it wasn't totally crowded...then again I visited right at opening (3PM) I have read previous reviews that this place gets busy. However, worth going with a date, a friend, or heck I'd go solo and eat a whole bingsoo to myself. I can totally do it. Challenge accepted."}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of shaved ice, but I do love my matcha and red bean combo!

Korean style shaved ice is a lot lighter and not so liquifying as you're used to. It isn't as crunchy either, or drenched in syrup. It almost appears like actual snow - get it? It's called Snow Time. Overall, it has a flaky texture and look to it.

Instead, the topping has the powder aspect of your chosen flavour and the added components within the bottom layer of the ice. It's definitely different and lighter (not too sure how they do it), but it's worth the experience!

Even if you may or may not like the style of shaved ice, at least you can move on with your life knowing you've tried it! 

The interior of the parlour revolves around the Korean authenticity and has cute stuffed animals placed around for you to take pictures with! Also a cool hanging hammock right at the front of the shop (strange placing). To keep it within the culture they play Kpop most of the time, so my friend definitely enjoyed that!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Tuesday afternoon. The place had just opened so it was fairly quiet. The interior bright and welcoming, and the service was friendly (albeit a bit slow).

We got a large bowl of injeomi shaved ice for $10.95 and a regular caramel latte for $4.25. The latte was quite good and the shaved ice was pretty big (big enough to satisfy the both of us). The shaved ice came with layers of the soybean powder inside the ice as well as a thick layer on top. It also had almonds, some sweet red bean, and a small cup of condensed milk on the side.  The texture of the ice is light and almost fluffy, and the flavour of the shaved ice is lightly sweetened and earthy (from the soybean powder). I don't think it would suit everyone's taste, but I certainly enjoyed it.  They also have fruit flavours as well that I will definitely come back again to try.

The only reason I took off one star is because, as I said before, service is a bit slow, and it is rather pricey for ice. With all that said though, it is a pretty unique concept for Scarborough and it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Love this place! First time going the server/owner (I think) was really nice and did a small intro and suggestions for us to try. My husband ordered a caramel latte and ask for less sweet, they made it the perfect sweetness for him. I love how they layer the fillings in the ice, the shavings are so fluffy, melt in your mouth. We try the traditional flavour  injeolmi bingsu (korean rice cake with soybean powder) perfectly sweeten. So refreshing!! Defiantly coming again and again! They had these beepers they give you while u wait so you know when ur order is ready. Not really necessary for a small place but I guess it's always nice to have. It wasn't too busy yet when we went so it was nice and quiet but I bet this place would get crowded later."}
{"text":"I like the snow ice, special and yummy. It taste like a milk and ice mixing together."}
{"text":"Wait time was ridiculous and had to stand for 15 minutes once we got our table cause they didn't have enough chairs. Most menu items not available, most things sold out, serving time was extremely slow. The bingsoo is not at all as good as Soul Cafe where they layer the toppings and condensed milk isn't just a diluted tablespoon worth on the side. Meh...hopefully it gets better. Would like to try again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I shared a regular mango shaved ice and a toast. The shaved ice is extremely thin and delicious! The regular size was the perfect size for us. We went on a Thursday evening around 8 and it wasn't busy at all. The only \"con\" I can really think of is something more personal. But the fork and knife they give you to eat the toast is almost impossible to eat with cause they're so tiny"}
{"text":"I want to give this place half a star but it don't have that option.  Terrible service, terrible location,  all chairs are broken, tables are too small, the drinks taste like garbage.  I can get better for instant coffee you get at supermarket.  Never will come here again."}
{"text":"Ughhh soooooo good!!! I love the texture of Korean shaved ice, it's so soft and melts in your mouth. I've tried the mango and Oreo and honestly I can't even tell you which I prefer because they're both soo good! I guess it would depend on what you're in the mood for but you will not be disappointed with either flavour, I guarantee that. The Oreo one taste like the bottom of your cup of milk after you're done dipping your Oreos so goooood"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of bingsu or any type of shaved ice but I think the ones I got at Snow Time were decent in terms of flavour and size.

In terms of cost, paying 8+ dollars for flavoured ice is a bit costly, but I guess you are paying for the flavours and toppings.

My friends and I got the matcha red bean, where the shaved ice was matcha flavoured and was topped with red bean and matcha ice cream. We substituted the ice cream for mochi. The matcha bingsu itself was rich in matcha flavour. Slightly bitter but still sweet. The red bean and condensed milk also balanced the bitterness from the matcha. I love mochi and these were nice and chewy, great substitution.

My friends also got the traditional one with soy bean powder, almonds and mochi on top of a milk bingsu. All together the flavours mixed well and gave it a soy bean taste. There were also red bean in it which gave it a slight sweetness to it. This one was lighter than the matcha. My friend found the base itself bland and could use a bit more sweetness, but I thought it was good.

Overall not bad for shaved ice. Considering most of their bingsu choices are on a milk shaved ice base, I'm not completely sure if I would go back often since I'm not a huge fan of bingsu. Perhaps they can do more flavours then I may come back to try the others. That being said, I would recommend trying this place if you want to try Korean style shaved ice!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the snow ice hype at this place. Me and my friend tried the green tea flavour, it was so good. The condensed milk that accompanied it, mixed well with it. I am excited to try the mango flavour next time! However, been trying to visit this place a couple of times, but it always closed! So weird! It said on the door that winter hours close on monday. But now that it's almost summer, whats the operating hours? Went there on tuesday, it was closed. Trying to go again on Wednesday, now it said on yelp that it's closed today. This place close so often.  Very disappointing:("}
{"text":"Ive tried other shaved ice dessert places and Ill still return to this one because its not just ice, theyve added other stuff in it. Personally would choose strawberry and original over the others. The girl in charge of the cashier is always super sweet and friendly. Worth the price"}
{"text":"Very very very yummy! Tried the Injeolmi Redbean and Mango this time, gonna try Matcha redbean next time!"}
{"text":"It's my first time here so far so good! I would recommend the Injeolmi Bingsoo  which is like a sweet rice cake shaved ice with graham cracker crumbs, red bean and almonds on top(a small amount of condense milk on the side was also included). The shaved ice was layered with the toppings unlike other places in Toronto where they usually just put the sweeteners on top and the bottom would always bland. However, their coffee was way too bitter to my likings. Other than that, although their service was great, I find it way too slow since there was a lot of people waiting in line and they still stuck to their way of handling customers. They first asks for your name and then you would have to wait for your seat. Then, when you get to your seat, you would have to wait for them to call your number so that you can walk up to order (don't know why they would do this). Finally, you get your order and munch away! This also applies to takes outs where it takes the customers the same amount of time as those waiting in line for their seats which I find it inefficient. They have wifi with the password written on a cute little board on the counter and the store decor was very relaxing with 2 tvs and a fake fire place in one of the corners. The employees had a cute work outfit on and the area was very clean; just like the cafes I've been to when I visited Korea. In general, I got 2 regular coffee (cappuccino and cafe mocha for around $4.19 each) and a regular Injeolmi Bingsoo ($8 something) for under $20, pretty decent for this type of desert and service."}
{"text":"As bingsoo goes, this one's pretty tasty, but the portions and the prices don't match up. I'd say this is the best in the Scarborough area, but there is definitely better elsewhere. I'd say the service was quite good though. I was going to order two large bingsoos for four people, and the lady at the counter suggested I order two regulars instead because the regulars are enough for one to two people. It worked out very well for us, especially because we had just had a large dinner. 

We were seated at an awkward table. It was for four people, but on the booth side of the seating, there was one seat (mine) that happened to be where the cushioned section ended, so my seat was half cushion and half awkward electric outlet area. It was not the most comfortable thing. Perhaps there would be a better place to separate two and four person tables.

The ice here looks like shorter coconut shavings. It's still super fluffy. It's also milky. 

Their matcha bingsoo had almond flakes, matcha powder, red bean, and a few pieces of injeolmi (rice cake covered in roasted grain powder). I very much appreciated the almond flakes. The additional crunch was lovely. There could have been a tad more matcha powder, but I like my matcha flavor strong. I thought the demo picture of the matcha bingsoo had matcha ice cream or matcha whipped cream on it, but it didn't come with our bingsoo. Not sure what happened there. The condensed milk on the side was not necessary for me, but it was still nice to have. 

The mixed fruit bingsoo had blueberries, mangoes, and strawberries, each in their own flavored syrup. There were a disproportionate number of mangoes and strawberries to blueberries. There could have been more blueberries, but the fruits were all sweet, although this may have been because of the syrup. This one, compared to the matcha one, needed the extra condensed milk. 

For all fans of Korean culture, they have LINE plushies and the Descendants of the Sun plushies. They were also playing Descendants of the Sun with Chinese subs on one TV, and a mix of Big Bang, Apink, IU, GFriend, etc. on the other.

While there are better bingsoos in Toronto, I'll probably still come back because of the convenience of this location."}
{"text":"If you're around the area, you should definitely come check out this dessert place! Came here on Saturday with my friends right when it was 3 pm and it soon became very packed so I would suggest coming here early. On the other hand, the atmosphere is very comfortable and they have kdramas playing on the TV! 

This was my first time trying bingsoo and it was super yummy. The bingsu is incredibly soft and melts right away in your mouth. I got the regular sized Matcha Redbean bingsoo for $8.99 and portion wise, it wasn't very big. The matcha powder is not sweet at all, but the red bean and the condensed milk adds up for the sweetness level. My friends and I all ordered regular sized bingsoo's and they finished it!"}
{"text":"It was alright. I think soul cafe in North York is better. Worth a try but not for a 2nd visit.

Food: 3/5, the toppings at the top were nice with the snowy ice but as you dig deeper, you lose the flavour. Furthermore, the metal bowl makes it hard to eat.

Service: 3/5, the waitress was nice and brings the food items over. 

Ambience: 3/5, some Kpop in the background and seats were nice but the table was wonky and shifty.

Price: 2/5, pretty overpriced at around $15 for a large and $10 for small."}
{"text":"The place was not the nicest looking. Seems like the place can use a renovation with the interior. The storage area was just all over in-front of the bathroom. I like the Line themed decor but it be better.

The bathroom had Line stickers with tape showing... laziness is what I see. The trash cans had a huge X on it so what's the point for having it in the first place and they place stuff animals on top of that...weird...

The bingsuu... kinda a disappointment compared to other injelomi bingsuus that I had. They had one layer of the mochi  ur the red bean and powered sugared they had twos..

The pineapple bingsuu... it was ok just like any other

I just wished their presentation was less messy. The sauce was just dripping all over the place and they didn't bother cleaning it."}
{"text":"I have went to many different places that serve Korean shaved ice, but I must say snow time is definitely one of the best.

I got the Oreo shaved ice and it was very good and tasted very fluffy. At other places, you can tell you are eating ice, but at snow time each bite has flavour and does not taste water downed when the ice starts melting. It came with condensed milk if you want it to be sweeter. The portions are pretty big so it is advised to share with friends.

The place itself is quite small so I do recommend going in big groups and expect waiting time to be long during their busy hours since each order can take around 15 min."}
{"text":"Bing soo is really good. I've tried injeomi, red bean matcha and Oreo. Their all really good but my favourite is Injeomi. The only flaw is that the parking is super bad!!"}
{"text":"Went to try this relatively new Korean dessert place near my house. It was a bit busy when we went on a Friday night and it was during dinner time. When you walk in, you order first and a find a table to sit down. We ordered the mango and matcha green tea bingsoo. We were given a buzzer which let's us know when its ready. We waited for about 20 minutes or so. The bingsoo was quite nice in terms of presentation and comes with a side of sugar in case its not sweet enough. It was nice and delicious but quite a high price point of nearly $13 for the dessert which I find is pricey. While we were eating, the chair that my friend was sitting on broke and he fell. The staff were somewhat sympathetic towards him so they gave him a 20% off card for the next visit. Basically they didn't want to get sued for this incident. To add matters, the staff told us you couldn't play cards when it gets busy but we were playing the whole time. The place is quite small with very limited seating and there are lineups in the evenings on the weekends. Overall, the dessert was quite delicious but I wish the staff handled our situation better."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have enjoyed my visits to Snowtime for their bingsu desserts.

My favourite is definitely the injeolmi bingsu. If you haven't been here before or haven't had bingsu before, then you got to try the injeolmi one - it's literally the classic. Bingsu is a unique dessert that's based off finely shaved milk ice with various toppings. The injeolmi bingsu is a nutty explosion coming from the ground beans. There's chewiness coming from the mochi, creaminess of the milky shaved ice, and it's happiness in your mouth. It's layered pretty well even in the large sizes. Personally, sharing a regular sized one for two should suffice but upgrading to a large is definitely worth it to share as well. 

Snowtime is a rather small and popular place, where people take their time while eating their desserts, so expect it to be packed if you come here during the weekends. I also really liked how lounge-y this place feels, with a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and has nice shaven ice dessert! They have a variety of of flavours that compliments the shaven ice very well, making it not too sweet! This place is good to go to with friends to just hangout and share a dessert together. It goes get a bit busy sometimes but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We've visited this location several times now and usually have the traditional bingsoo. The 'shaved ice' here has a much different look and texture than what is usually served at 'taiwan' shaved ice places. Resembling grains of snow it has a nice soft texture that melts instantly on the tongue. The mochi and red bean with almonds all give a nice balance to the dessert. All in all refreshing and not overly sweet.  

Friendly service, establishment clean. Parking can be busy at times but plenty of spots available. 

3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Nice little dessert place in Scarborough.  The shaved milk ice was very good and the place has an easy going atmosphere which makes it pretty comfortable compared to other Asian restaurants and dessert shops.  I would come back again"}
{"text":"I've been going to Yonge St for my bingsu fix, namely The Cups & Soul Caf√©, so it's great to have a place that's so much closer to home. Amongst the ones I've tried, the classic injeolmi is still my favorite. I love the nuttiness of the soybean powder, and it pairs perfectly with the creaminess of the shaved milk. I also like how it's layered alongside mochi bits & almond slices so that the bottom is not just plain ice. The condensed milk on the side was a nice touch as well to customize the amount of sweetness. All in all, a pretty solid place.  

On the side note, it's so cute how they have a collection of LINE plushies, as well as a JoongKi bear from Descendants of the Sun."}
{"text":"Two times in three days LOL (I might visit again tonite ^_^)

It's time for Snow Time! There's a new dessert place in town located right in the same plaza at Marathon Caf√© and opposite Coco. I was looking to visit either Caf√© de Paris or the Cups but then Snow Time peeked up on Yelp and since it was so close to Caf√© de Paris and with the Cups being kind of further away, I decided to go with Snow Time instead and I am so glad I did. 

I arrived at 4:55 ish - 5:00pm thinking it won't be busy or even empty but oh Boy, was I wrong. It was completely packed! The girl working at the counter Cindy (whom may be one of the owners) said it should be about 5 to 10 minutes wait. Fortunately, I only waited five minutes till a table opened up.   Afterwards, it seemed the crowd started to subside and the place started to clear up. I guess best time in the evening is to go after 5 pm till it gets busy again at 6: ish - 7pm?    This place may have 24 seats but it is always packed every time I go there. Must be very popular and doing well.

This place sells Bingsoo, toasts, drinks and many other items but their star item is DEFINITELY the BINGSOO, beginning at $8.95 (+ tax). Bingsoo is a very popular and elaborate snack/dessert in Korea, especially during the summer season. This snack is composed of ice shavings and various ingredients such as sweetened condensed milk, fruit syrups, various fruits, small pieces of tteok (rice cake), chewy jelly bits, and cereal flakes.
 
Snow Time signature and most popular flavor is the Injeomi Bingsoo. The Injeomi bottom base consists of shaved milk with layers of condensed milk. The top is topped with almonds, mochi, red bean and soy bean powder. The dessert wasn't very sweet and there is additional condensed milk that comes with your Bingsoo should u need to add more sweetness   I enjoyed every spoonful of the shaved snow ice. The dessert comes in a special dish that slows down the melting of your shaved snow ice so that you can enjoy the dessert bite after bite before it melts.  There is also a toast version if you don't want shaved ice. 

I also came by with friends at 7:47 on a Sunday nite and ended up waiting for few minutes for a bigger table and then close to 30 minutes for the items.  We tried their Injeomi and Matcha Red Bean Bingsoo but I didn't enjoy the Matcha as much as the Injeomi. Maybe because I found the Matcha flavor is not strong enough. The Matcha Bingsoo consists of condensed milk, shaved milk, red bean and matcha powder. 

I also got the Mango Bingsoo, which is quite popular with Asians. The staff had to check on the inventory to make sure there was enough to make a Mango Bingsoo and this was just 5:30 on an evening.  Mango Bingsoo consists of Mango, Mango Sauce, Condensed Milk and of course Shaved Milk and is topped with whipped cream.  Mango is always my favourite so I quite like it.  

Wait time can vary for your order of Bingsoo, depending if there is already a queue.  It may vary from 18 mins to 30+ minutes. So definitely not a in and out place in 15 minutes.  Also, if you dining in, you can't order unless you have a table and is sitting down.  Ordering is most of the time at the counter. This place does offer take out though :)

Great place to chill out with friends while waiting for your Bingsoo order. Also, the place has cute plush toys  in front of the stores for customers to play with and take pictures :) 

I asked the owners if they had Instagram but for the time being, they are just concentrating on their soft opening. I really think they should have Instagram haha.  Instead, they advised me to write on Yelp, which I said I will definitely write a review hehe.

I want to give kudos to the staff and their 100% great customer service. Cindy who served us was very nice, patient and very helpful when deciding what to get.  She also recognized me and remembered my name :)

The prices on the display screen is the most updated price list. There is a price lists sheet but the prices have not been updated yet since their opening. 

Parking is ok though it can get quite busy in that plaza. If no parking in front, park at the back. 

Decor is quite coquettish and modern.

Taiyaki is not available yet but I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"The place was packed just 15 minutes after opening on a Saturday. I think the place seats about 30 but the wait time is ridiculously long. We had to wait 25 minutes for our order and other people who ordered within minutes of us had about double the wait time. They seem to only make one order at a time. 

We had the matcha red bean bingsoo. I thought it was pretty good. I liked matcha flavor and the sweetness of the red beans. I also liked how there were toppings inside and not just all on top. There was also condensed milk on the side for you to pour on your bingsoo to adjust the sweetness to your liking. 

I don't think this is a place you can really sit around for long since you feel bad for taking up a table while there are people waiting.

The parking lot here was chaotic! People don't seem to pay attention to where they're going at all! Be careful driving here!

I would still return here to try the mango bingsoo despite the long wait times."}
{"text":"It was our first time trying Bingsoo (Bingsu) and it was pretty nice! Nice location and good selection of desserts!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place and finally, a patbingsoo dessert place in Scarborough! The workers are super friendly and explained what the dessert was (even though I already knew). They let us sample the soy bean powdered mochi when we were indecisive between injeomi or matcha bingsoo. I do find the prices to be abit expensive for what you get, but the texture of the ice is definitely 'fluffy' and sooo soft! I've never had shaved ice like this before. 

When you enter the restaurant, the staff greets you in Korean but I think they're Chinese? I thought that was kinda cute haha. Anyways, you order at the cash and they give you the little buzzer to bring back to your table. It'll buzz whenever your order is ready to be picked up. The bingsoo is super tasty but I think more condensed milk should be given and portions are small. I feel like this is a type of cafe where if you want to get the most out of your money, you bring your laptop and do some work haha. 

Tl;dr: slightly expensive, but great tasting bingsoo"}
{"text":"Jen and I are always on the look-out for any new dessert places to visit.  Thankfully, one not too far was Snow Time, a cool Korean dessert place that's serving up some shaved ice desserts...called Bingsu (I think that's what it's called).
Not sure how long this place has been opened for, but its popular! 

Injeolmi Bingsu is what Jen and I shared.  Served in a big bowl, flavored shaved milk ice, topped off with sweet thick evaporated milk. Please keep in mind this dish takes at least 10 min to prepare.  

Pom tea is what we opted for drinks, something warm, soothing to a perfect experience.
This place is a gem for those who live close to here.
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy in my Tummy! 

However, be prepared for a long wait during busy times (weekend nights) I came here on a Saturday night and waited an hour to be seated and another half hour for the bingsu to come out. It was really good but was it worth the wait? Probably not. 
I recommend coming during non-peak times or even ordering take out.

By 10pm, all the fruit choices (mango, strawberry, mixed fruit) were sold out, so come early if you want a bigger selection. I had the Injeomi and it wasn't too sweet but it did come with some extra condensed milk on the side if you have a bigger sweet tooth like me. One regular sized bingsu costs a bit over $10 and can be shared by two people.
The injeomi came with soybean powder, almonds, and red bean on top. The ice shavings were unexpectedly creamy. I thought it was just be shaved ice pieces what you would get from a snow cone but no this was x10 better.

Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great little dessert place for Korean shaved ice! I ordered the mango bingsoo and it was very refreshing to eat. The shaved ice is very soft and it's sweet enough as is, I didn't find the need to have to use the extra condensed milk on the side. So try it out before pouring the whole thing on top!

I took a point off because it gets very busy after dinner, I went on a weekend both times and it can get quite crowded at the front. I think there's still some kinks they have to work out for ordering/seating during peak hours. I was with a group of 7 people so we had to wait for about 30 minutes before we got seated. I definitely don't recommend coming here if you have a group bigger than 4 people because they don't have many big tables. 

Other than that I would come back again to try their other offerings. I'm really interested in the savory snacks that are coming soon!"}
{"text":"A delicious way to end the night. A big bowl of fluffy and creamy shaved ice topped with your favourite flavour. 

This place is perfect for a date or just a casual hangout. The inviting atmosphere and picturesque food makes everyone want to share it on social media.

Overall, a must try! Price is right. Atmosphere is great. Food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place to you if you're looking for a light dessert. Depending on the time it can be hard to find parking. Parking lot is one way but most people don't seem to notice that so it gets pretty hectic. Dessert wise I would recommend the mango or injeolmi. Mango sometimes sells out early."}
{"text":"This place is very popular and for good reason! The bingsoo is delicious and the decor is really nice. My friends and I come here pretty regularly because that's how good this place is.

I recommend the mixed fruit, mango, injeomi or matcha redbean bingsoo. It really depends what kind of mood you're in but don't be afraid to try something new. 

The fried chicken here is pretty good too (I like the honey master chicken), but it's a little bit on the pricy side and the portions are clearly meant for one person so be aware of that."}
{"text":"This place is so good!

I've only had the mango bingsoo, but I'm definitely going back. Even though it's winter, they didn't serve disgusting inedible sour frozen mangoes like some of the other bingsoo places do. The mango bingsoo was sweet, refreshing, and fresh. I've had a few where it's only the toppings that give it flavour, but here they add a layer of jam or syrup close to the middle of the snow so it's sweet throughout. We had just enough mango to finish all the snow, we didn't even have to use the sweetened condensed milk they provided on the side.  It was perfect!

The staff are also super friendly. My cousin and I wanted to get a large bingsoo and the lady told us that it's really big and if we just had dinner, then it might be better to just get the small to share. I appreciate that she helped us out and didn't just take our money.

A lot of these places have a minimum one order per person, but not here! It's super chill and the decor is really cute. I can't get over how much I like this place!

I'm super happy with my experience here and really cannot wait to go back to this cute dessert place!"}
{"text":"This tried-and-true bingsu store is definitely one of the better places I would come to have bingsu in the GTA. 

I came on multiple occasions and they were all great every time. The ice actually tasted milky and flavorful combined with the condensed milk.

They aren't too skimpy on the toppings either.The smallest size is in a cup now and then their medium and large is in a bowl. Prices are very comparable and preferably worth the amount they give you."}
{"text":"This updated review is mainly for the service. The service is horrible here. They are new so they are still figuring out how to manage their customers effectively. My group walked in and stood In line to order. When it was our turn to order at the counter, we were told we were \"supposed\" to get a pager for a table if we wanted to sit down. 

Well, this was my second time coming. The first time I came, I lined up at counter to order and to get seated at the same time. It would be logical for me to assume I would do the same for my second visit. But NOPE, apparently you are supposed to get a pager when you enter to get a table. BUT there are no signs to indicate this so how do customers know ? 

Therefore I wasted 20minutes waiting in line for nothing. No apologies whatsoever. After my order, there was another 30minute wait. I don't think I will return here since the service is horrible and they are still figuring out how to manage the operations effectively."}
{"text":"Omo Omo! Snow Time became my friend and I's new it-spot :D The interior is similar to your typical Korean drama cafes haha. The theme is the characters from LINE (an app) and they even have a big teddy of Song Joong Ki !! Obviously we took pictures with that one!!

We came here during the weekend and there were surprisingly a lot of empty tables. Service was excellent. You order at the counter and receive a beeper, which will indicate when your item is ready to be picked up. Chairs and sofas are nice and comfy - great for a girls night out :)

* INJEOMI BINGSOO (4/5)
(Red bean, almonds, mochi and peanut powder with milky shaved ice & condensed milk)

LOVE THIS! This was one of the highly recommended items on the menu so we gave this a shot. Sooo good! My favourite item is the mochi.. It's chewy and flavourful because of the peanut powder. I also liked the shaved ice, it looks like coconut flakes but tastes like condensed milk. Condensed milk can be added on top too (You'll be missing out if you don't add it haha)

We will return to try the other shaved ice flavours!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place as there are good reviews. Unfortunately, they didn't meet my expectations.

The wait times were very long just for the shaved ice (bingsu) to arrive. It seemed like they only had one lady making the desserts, while they had about 6-7 orders ahead of mine. I waited for about half an hour. Definitely think they can use another machine to speed things up...

I ordered the matcha redbean bingsu and there were two items that were identically named on the menu. The cashier agreed and so I thought he knew which one I was referring to... but I ended up being served the one I DID NOT want. 

Putting that aside, the matcha redbean bingsu was a light tasting but refreshing dessert. The regular size is perfect for one, or for sharing! I personally find the sweet condensed milk flavour a bit faint (it just tastes like slightly sweet ice at some point). The toppings of shaved almonds, mochi, azuki beans and red bean do enhance the flavour. 

The shop itself is not very cute - it is pretty old and has poor decor. To make things worse, the tables are super close together and your conversation is definitely being overheard. I've been to the newly opened The Cups and my expectations were somewhere along those lines."}
{"text":"Korean dessert? Bingsoo? Shaved snow? I grew up having snow cones and I've had shaved ice but nothing like this before. This shaved milk was much lighter and fluffier, like the texture of fresh fallen snow.

My companions all chose the more traditional Injeolmi (red bean) and I chose pineapple. At 8.49 for a small one, it's not exactly cheap. It's not exactly small either. Mine was a little messy, with pineapple syrup dripping over the edge of the cup but it certainly tasted good. I could get addicted to this.

Their menu also includes slushes, coffee, and fried chicken. That's just more reason to come back (and save room for dessert)!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Korean Bingsoo so this review maybe tainted with the excitement of getting to try something new! The three of us shared the large mixed fruit bingsoo and the large injeolmi bingsoo ($23.15). I personally preferred the injeolmi since it had a more subtle nutty flavor that was mellow but still delicious. I loved the little mocchi bites on the top and the layering of redbean paste halfway down the bowl. The shaved ice portion is creamy and soft, melting evenly and leaving a clean taste on your tongue. It's not heavy, so you can keep eating without feeling full or gross. The mixed fruit bingsoo is much sweeter and sugary than the injeolmi. The fruits are fresh and holds up well to the sweeter shaved ice. Also, there is a scoop of vanilla icecream on the top for extra creaminess!

Admittedly it's on the pricey side for what you get but it's a lovely treat, especially on a hot day but you want something lighter than icecream or gelato. A great first experience of bingsoo!"}
{"text":"I don't prefer this dessert. It just feels like you're eating fancy ice. The top layer is nice but after that it seems pointless. The place itself is cute, and the presentation of their shaved ice is IG worthy, but the overall experience is something you do once and never again."}
{"text":"Meh. Not worth the hype.

I've always wanted to try out Snow Time because of all the pretty Bingsu pictures I see on social media. We came in around 8pm on a Sunday in a group of 6 and we were given a buzzer and were told to wait about 30mins. The store space was very small with seats available for roughly 8 groups of diners, so it's recommended that you show up in smaller groups.

The ordering process is basically like a fast food place, where you place your order at the counter, then the buzzer will tell you when you can come over to collect your tray. Then after you're done you're expected to bring the tray back to the counter. So yeah, no need to pay for tips.

We ordered 2 Bingu: the Matcha and the Injeolmi (soybean powder), both Large size, and it came down to about $25 in total after taxes. The portion was quite small given that the toppings were only at the top of the Bingsu and the rest were basically fluffy shaved ice. We got a cup of condensed milk on the side to add some flavour, and trust me you'd need it because after eating all the toppings the ice was pretty much flavourless. 

Overall, the Bingsu still tasted good, but I've had better Bingsu elsewhere, such as at the Cups for similar prices, so I don't think I would come back again especially due to the long wait."}
{"text":"I visited Snow Time on a Sunday afternoon around 4 and it wasn't too busy so we were able to grab a seat for 2. They had several different options for bingsu and we picked the Injeolmi bingsu to share. The Injeolmi bingsu was really delicious and came with mochi, red bean, and condensed milk! A small was $10 and a good size to share between 2 people."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait if you come! I don't know how it is like on weekdays but I came on a Saturday right when they opened (3pm) and they had a lineup within 30mins. They have enough seating for ~30 people. The speed of the service doesn't help either as it took 25 minutes for our order to come. The table next to us ordered a minute after and theirs came in 40mins. I don't know how it's made but they really need to step it up. 

I ordered the Matcha Redbean Bingsoo ($9.95). It had matcha, redbean, almond slices and mochi. I liked how it wasn't just a bunch of toppings on top of the shaved ice. The toppings were mixed throughout the shaved ice which was nice. They also had a little container of condensed milk for us to pour over the shaved ice. 

Also, the plaza that it's located in it is pretty hectic. I wouldn't say it was too busy when I went as I found parking right away, but there were a lot of drivers who weren't paying attention to other cars or they didn't care if they were stopped right in the middle of the road and blocking all traffic. Be careful if you're driving here. 

Overall, despite the wait time for food, I would come back and try their other flavours. I do hope they pick up their speed on orders."}
{"text":"The shaved ice is good and reminiscent of what I actually had in Korea when I visited. Very finely shaved, the texture is much more like snow than it is ice. The flavours are generally not very sweet, which I suppose is in line with how the Korean shaved ice tends to be. This is in contrast to Taiwanese shaved ice for example, which tends to be mega sweet. Up to you what you prefer - it's just a note to help you manage your expectations. The traditional Korean flavour  (injeolmi) is not for everyone; it's more of an earthy flavour which is rather different from what you'd typically expect from a dessert.

Seating is rather limited (maybe a bit over 20 people can fit in the place?) and their line management is a disaster. But the workers are nice enough. Expect around a 30-min wait during busy periods. Interestingly I don't think the place is actually run by Koreans (the Korean media they show on the TV tends to have Chinese subtitles and the workers I saw were Chinese speaking), which is funny because they will greet you with a little \"ahnyounghaseyo\" when you walk in. No different from Koreans running sushi restaurants and saying \"irrashaimase\" I guess.

It seems to be cash and debit only. And you're looking at about $10 for the dessert which all things considered is on the pricey side. In terms of serving size, it's a perfect size for two people to split, though I suppose one person could have no problem finishing one order as long as they didn't just come out from a massive diner."}
{"text":"My friends and I picked this on a whim on a Saturday night and it turns out to be one of the best bingsu places we've been to! We ordered the injeolmi and the matcha flavour, unfortunately the mango flavour was sold out. (We were told that they pick a limited amount of mangos on the day of to guarantee freshness and sweetness).

Both bingsus came with toasted almond flakes and injeolmi covered mochi pieces (which were super chewy and delicious). The shaved ice itself looked like short coconut flakes, which melted in your mouth into a milky liquid. For both flavours, there were respective powders layered between the shaved ice so you are not left with just ice after the initial topping. Each bingsu came with a side of condensed milk, which I recommend adding to the matcha flavour (or it will be too bitter for some people), but the injeolmi was perfect as it is!

We did not experience wait despite coming on Saturday night. And the service was pretty quick after we ordered. The store was cozy and had throw pillows for you to use. 

Overall, it was definitely worth the price and we will definitely be coming back to try other flavours in the future! 
-------
Update: 
We got the mango bingsu today and it was absolutely worth the hype! Each chunk of mango was the perfect ripeness: sweet and juicy! 

On the side, we also tried the oreo bingsu but it was nothing out of the ordinary. So if you are looking for a recommendation, then definitely try the injeolmi and the mango one!"}
{"text":"I still really like this place. I know not to go on weekends so I've always had a good time coming on weekdays/nights. It's not nearly as busy.

I haven't been back in months but the girl who served us the very first time back in October (and January) still remembered our faces. The mixed fruit bingsu was as good as ever. People have said that there's not much flavor to the bingsu but I don't really find this to be a huge problem - the way I've always eaten it is to have some topping with it too which is more than sweet enough. They also have ice cream on top now which is different from the beginning and is a nice addition. The atmosphere is really relaxing here with kpop playing on the TV, comfy seating, and cute stuffed animals. Service was quite friendly as usual :)"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time I got take-out and didn't feel the photo would do it justice. I have tried the mango, Oreo, and matcha bing soo. Every one tasted very good but it wasn't like \"wow.\" The quality of ingredients is very high but I still find it a little pricey for the portion. They have savory food like chicken wings and toast which I will likely come back to try because the bing soo makes it good enough to be a regular dessert place. There's lots of seating but the last time I got take-out because it was so crazy busy. I found that the bottom half of the bing soo tastes better because that's where the condensed milk was. All-in-all good ice cream place to come to, better than the one at pmall."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of shaved ice, and I was super excited to try this place out for the first time. We managed to beat the rush by heading in early afternoon. It's a very cozy place!

Four of us shared small iterations of the injeolmi, the mango, and the peach bingsu. Portions were more than enough. They are all amazing! Love the fresh, fluffy texture of the shaved ice layered with the various toppings. The injeolmi is certainly a novel flavour profile, with the nutty soy powder mixed with sweet red bean and chewy mochi -- that was probably my favourite. Despite it being winter, the fruits were nice and sweet. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife about 5 or 6 times already. We keep getting the redbean shaved ice. The best way I can describe the shaved ice is that its a dry shaved ice. Not the same as Cha me cha. The service is excellent but sometimes it is very busy and can expect lineup to go all the way outside. The place is small fairly small with out 8 tables. There is nothing like this place unless you go to Korea. This is why we keep coming back. The shaved ice is amazing and its one of a kind for now."}
{"text":"Their Bingsu is great I like how the ice is fine like how it's supposed to be!! :) I gave it a four star because when we went they ran out of all food items and half the bingsu.  They also ran out of condensed milk?!? I guess that's what you get when the place is crazy busy.. You pretty much have to self serve yourself as well.  All in though I would def go back for their bingsu."}
{"text":"This was a cute little place. The shaved ice had a nice and fluffy texture which melts pleasantly over my tongue. 

The fried chicken however was pretty standard, nothing too impressive and I felt it was a bit overpriced for what its worth. The service was nice but the food took some time to come to us even though we were one of the two tables there. Not sure why they gave us that buzzer thing haha."}
{"text":"I love Snow Time! They have one of the best bingsoos I have tried in the area. This is a pretty popular place so you usually need to wait to be seated. My favorite is the injeolmi (soybean powder) flavor. I love how the shaved ice here is milk flavor and they have layers in between so you get flavor with each bite! The texture is very light yet creamy becaise of the milk flavor. You also get a pitcher with condensed milk (which I generally never use since it's sweet enough for me).

The injeolmi comes with rice cake, blanched almond slices and red bean. I have also tried the matcha and mango but this one is still my top choice. The amount of toppings has halved compared to when they first opened which kind of sucks. But the flavor is still the same. 

This is a good place for groups (no larger than 4 as they are quite busy) or couples. They also have plushies that you can sit with or take photos with. Some of them are from the Korean drama DOTS (Descendants of the Sun) which is pretty cool. Just keep in mind that the desserts do take some time to make."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place after I heard about it from my friend. The ambiance is nice and the staff are very friendly. I ordered a injeomi bins shaved ice and Injeomi injected toast. The toast was ok it was something I could've made at home but with he sauce it was a different kind of taste but the injeomi shaved ice was absolutely phenomenal it tasted like ice cream. I will definetly come back here and try their other shaved ice selection maybe matcha."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try shaved ice and snow time is the place I tried shaved ice for the first time on my life. Honestly I had a great experience, really loved the shaved ice. What's cool is that you can order and take it to go!"}
{"text":"I think this has got to be my new favourite place so far for Korean shaved ice. Tried the Injeomi bingsoo and this has got to be my favourite by far. I never imagined that something normally so flavourless like ice could be so tasty but the Injeomi really hits the spot. It is basically topped with soy powder, good amounts of mochi, some red beans, and thin almond slices. It comes with a side of condensed milk in a tin cup as well. The combination of different textures of toppings go so well together. It might seem weird but even the thin almond slices were so tasty as well. I was impressed that the mochi came in chunks rather than bits because that is also one of the best parts. What is great is that they put toppings in the middle of the bowl as well so that you dont't end up eating plain ice once you near the bottom of the bowl. The texture of the snow is quite unique too. It looks like coconut flakes and appears light but once you eat it, it tastes dense but in a good way.

Came back a second time to try the Mango bingsoo as well. The mango is sweet and are cut in big chunks but I think Injeomi definitely wins in terms of taste and uniqueness.

The atmosphere is great as well and super relaxing. Service is very friendly and the preparation time is decent. It is kind of self served because you first place your order at the counter after which they will give you a buzzer to prompt you once your order is ready. With the buzzer the wait is not too bad.

The decor is simple but nice. Not sure why but there are LINE dolls at the front as well where customers can bring to their table

Other than that its such a nice place and I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Korean shaved ice."}
{"text":"Shaved ice has never been a dessert I ever got excited about but this place definitely changed my perspective. 

Location wise, sorta hidden in a Scarborough plaza. Not much service, more of a grab and sit down. The ambiance could be more inviting/cozy. 

The shaved ice itself is very milky/creamy, not just that \"water\" taste. I got the matcha red bean and I love how the flavour is throughout the cup and not just concentrated on the top. A little bit on the sweeter side since there is ribbons of condensed milk throughout the bingsu. My friend got the mixed fruit and it was delicious! 

A dessert I don't mind having even during -30 degree weather"}
{"text":"Rejoice! Snow Time is open again!

I love Snow Time. Their employees are always so friendly and cheerful, the interior is warm, and their bingsoo is wonderful. They added new menu items, lowered their prices, introduced a small bingsoo cup size, and got new disposable cups for their bingsoo. My sister and I shared the new A! Peach bingsoo flavour.

A! Peach bingsoo: This new flavour comes with the milk shaved ice, peach pieces, some peach syrup, and vanilla ice cream. This bingsoo is not too sweet, and their peaches (nectarines?) are delicious. I was disappointed to get to the bottom and see that there were no more peaches (it was just syrup), but it was still good. I think this bingsoo could use another flavour because it's all peach aside from the ice cream. Worth a try, but if it's your first time here, I'd recommend the Injeolmi or Matcha red bean instead.

Snow Time also got new menu photos which are really cute! I will continue to support this place forever.

(ALSO, they will have Korean churros very soon! Probably next week. Keep an eye out!)"}
{"text":"Tried the mixed fruits shaved ice, macha injeolmi and and oreo flavor. I liked the macha as it is not too sweet. Cafe latte is not bad at all.

Always packed with people. At first we were told to  wait for 15 minutes but lucky us a big group was ready to leave so we were seated in 5 min.

I find the serving bowl they use for shaved ice desert too small. Everytime you try to scoop the ice some of it fell on the tray. Just too messy to eat."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 3.5 but I've rounded up because of its unique shaved ice. The reason why it doesn't deserve a full 4 star is because they either ran out of fruits or they didn't make certain items on their menu. The menu is small to begin with so we weren't left with many choices after they cut out half of it.

We ended up with the Oreo bingsoo and the injeomi bingsoo. When we first dig into it, my mom's first comment was, \"Look at all the coconut!\" We soon realized that the coconut was actually ice. The ice was so finely milled, it's unlike any other restaurants that serves shaved ice. The flavour was light but in a sophisticated way.

I would definitely come back here to try out their other flavours (if they don't run out of ingredients or decide to make it). Keep in mind that this place is quite small so you might have to wait for a seat."}
{"text":"Amazing place! I ordered a mixed Bingsoo and also a Matcha Redbean Bingsoo...both were so delicious. The atmosphere here is very cozy and comfy. The staff that work here are very nice and accommodating. Definitely happy to have chosen to come here, 100% recommended to others and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's so cute and the menu is straight forward. Got the regular mixed fruit ($9.99) and regular oreo bingsu ($8.49). My boyfriend loved the mixed fruit and he's not keen on finishing his desserts but he killed it. I definitely liked the mixed fruit better as well because of how well the fruits and shaved ice complimented each other. The oreo was good but hard to get into for the first few bites; the toppings fall off on your first scoop. Would have definitely enjoyed it more if we had some condensed milk on the side (not too sure if they usually give that or if its extra charge) but as soon as you finish the top you're left with the shaved ice which I still enjoyed, but would have enjoyed it a lot more if there were flavours left. Nonetheless, the presentation of the bingsu was phenomenal, so cute and colourful and big enough for 2 people to share (depending on how hungry you are). It's a fairly small \"cafe\" and seats are limited especially if you're there with a group of friends. Parking is also hectic and tight but there's parking available behind the building. We'll definitely be coming back to try out their other flavours and drinks!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it was super packed. Had to wait a little bit for seats and they give you this buzzer thingy. My friends and I got seated at the lower round tables at the front of the store so it was a little bit harder to eat since the tables were very low but they had cute pillows from Line Friends! Wish we got the normal tables so it would've been easier to eat. 

We ordered 2 regular sized bingsu in mixed fruits (mango, strawberry, blueberry), and injeolmi. The mixed fruit bingsu was on the sweeter side, not because of the syrups but because the fruits were actually so sweet (probably in season??). The injeolmi bingsu had a really nutty flavour to it and was different in a good way. It came with condensed milk on the side and was topped with this powdery soy/peanut idk powder, red beans, and mochi bits. I really enjoyed the injeolmi bingsu except for the fact that the soy/peanut powder makes me cough when I eat it LOL..  

Overall, the restaurant is cute but the wait can take a while on a weekend night. The quality of their bingsu is also good, 2 regulars were filling for 3 people!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening for a dessert after I finished dinner in the area. The place was full, and we waited 15min. or so for a table for three. We got regular mango bingsoo, which was light and fluffy. The bingsoo itself doesn't have much flavour, and it's the toppings that make them so good. Our mango was light and sweet with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, and was true to the East Asian style of not-too-sweet desserts. I took off a star because of the service and the seating arrangement, which I found to be confusing. Upon entering, you are given a buzzer, and you wait until you are seated before you can order, even though the counter and the tables along the side suggests that you order and sit down right away. The waiting area also doesn't have much room; it's just a couple chairs and a bit of standing room in front of the door. Hopefully I can be back for a less busy time."}
{"text":"Shaved ice with amazing presentation, the price is a bit high, but worth the work they put in. They are very accommodating for allergies too, they took back and replaced our dessert with one. They are hand made so it takes some time, but it's worth the wait. It comes with condensed milk and the condiments are layered into the shaved ice, not just on top. Tasty and really good for sharing! definitely would come bacl"}
{"text":"Despite this \"Korean\" dessert being run by Mandarin Chinese, the desserts are actually quite on point. I highly recommend the Matcha Redbean PatBingSoo. The redbean's sweetness and the matcha green tea powder has good synergy with the milky flavored ice. I've also tried the Oreo PatBingSoo, however I found it too sweet for my liking. 

They catered to our friend's peanut allergies with extra care, which I found very impressive. 

It's a good experience, and a nice quiet place to hang out and chat with friends, when it's not packed with loud Mandarin speakers."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by how much I like this place! Didn't have high expectations since my past experiences with bingsoo were mediocre. 

We ordered the matcha red bean bingsoo and injeolmi toast.

Bingsoo was bomb..love how they layer the flavours among the \"Bing\", so it doesn't get too bland and watery after the top layer. They give you condensed milk on the side so you can customize the amount of sweetness based on your personal preference. 

I've always had the western toasts, ones with lots of cheese. I don't think they added cheese in their toasts, on the other hand, they have a thick delicious layer of glutinous like thing on the top, but right under the flavours (which are in powder form). Very interesting and will definitely come back to try more flavours.

The price is a bit steep but you do get a lot of food! People who work here are super nice and lots of cute cushions here."}
{"text":"Great shaved ice here!!!! The mango one is the bomb Bc their fruit is basically real and fresh (which we all hope for). Make sure u come early Bc mango is a best seller and it will be sold out very quickly. Don't get the other flavours Bc they're just sweet and bland. Seats get filled very fast so make sure u choose the right times to come (not after dinner or just before closing time). The cashier person is so nice and good to talk to. Amazing and refreshing dessert for not a high price!!!! 10/10 recommend better than cha me cha or sugar marmalade I would say. :)"}
{"text":"OH-NO.. The shaved ice is not as great as before anymore. First, the presentation of it has changed, the fruit is just randomly placing in the plastic cups now, which is disappointed (probably don't wanna hire people to wash them). Both strawberry and mango are not that fresh and as big as before either. I use to come here very often, but now I might need to find a new shaved ice restaurant."}
{"text":"5/5 for Snow Time because the injeolmi bingsu I had was DELICIOUS and the cozy, warm environment topped with friendly service made the whole experience very enjoyable. 

This cafe just opened 10 days ago. When I entered, I was surprised that the space was so big and capable of seating around 24 customers (I mean, the plaza looks so crowded from the outside). The simple things stood out for me, such as pillows on the chairs for back rest and vinyl stickers on the wall. The fireplace was a nice touch too! Oh and their bingsu display by the cash is awesome and perfect for those who need visuals on 6 of the 8 flavors offered. 

It was my first time here and the staff recommended the injeolmi as a popular pick. They even provided a good description of what went into the bowl: the base of the bingsu was condensed milk which was followed by a few thin layers of sliced almonds and red bean between the ice. The top of the bingsu was capped with those same ingredients and sprinkled with soft delicious mochi. The layering of toppings ensured that you weren't left with just ice as you work your way down. The ice looked like shredded coconut and tasted like the freshly fallen snow fluff that you'd eat as a kid! It also came with a side of condensed milk for those with a stronger sweet tooth. Our regular sized bingsu came to be $10 after tax (tips not required as you order and pay first).

Side notes: When I went on a Saturday afternoon, water wasn't offered but can be requested. Lastly, I think they should consider displaying their bingsu's by the window to attract more customers as many walk by not knowing what this cafe has to offer. All in all, I look forward to visiting again and trying their other flavors."}
{"text":"We've been on a bingsu tear lately and decided to try out snow time. The first time we visited, they were not open. We gave it a second try earlier on in the evening and at last they were open. We tried the original bingsu. The shaved ice was very creamy and the toppings were light and refreshing. The bottom was very creamy and sweet, so depending on your appetite for sugar, you either love it or hate it. Overall, would come back to try their other desserts"}
{"text":"Ordered the mango shaved ice to go. I found it good, I've had the korean dessert before however it tasted different than this. There is nothing really wrong per say with this dessert, just maybe expected something a little more.. There was no line up when I went sooo I didn't have to suffer the long wait!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I can finish the entire shaved ice. Just so good.  I ordered the injeolmi."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of shaved ice or bingsoo but this place is now my fave!

The environment is very neat and cozy(with cushions). Its a great place to hangout with friends and to chat about life. Service is really friendly and welcoming. 

We ordered the matcha bingsoo and injeoni toast. The bingsoo is not the typical shaved ice. The ice is fine, fluffy and tasted very creamy and milky. It wasn't bland as it contains layers of red bean inside. There is condensed milk on the side but the bingsoo has enough sweetness to it. 

The toast is something different. There is a glutinous layer on top with condensed milk."}
{"text":"Really good! Definitely recommend the mango bingsu - mangos were super sweet and ripe. However, the set up of the place is a little confusing though, you have to lineup to order your food then proceed to pick a table to sit at. This system can be confusing during really busy times, especially since the restaurant isn't THAT big to start with."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night at around 9:15 pm and the place was busy, so I decided to order my bingsoo to go, thinking this would be the faster option.  I was WRONG!  The worker said it would take 20 minutes, but it ended up taking 45 minutes! Forty five minutes for take out! Are you kidding me?  Hubby thinks they forgot about my order. Either way it was not pleasant waiting for that long for take out.

With that being said, service was courteous and polite, despite being extremely inefficient. 

I ordered a small injeomi bingsoo and it was delicious. Not overly sweet, light, and with a good amount of toppings. 

Was it worth a 45 minute wait for take out? I'm still debating."}
{"text":"Good for a try but way too expensive for the portion. I don't sense much of a difference between shaved ice from cha me cha and this. Maybe it's a bit more milky and the ice is very small but I'd rather get a huge one at cha me cha then a small portion of this for the price. Still good but a bit pricey in my opinion. Love the d√©cor and enough tables to sit unless it's a weekend night!"}
{"text":"i've been on an injeolmi bingsu binge my last few dessert outings just to compare them from each other.  Soul Cafe has been my fave and Cups being the least.  Snow Time is right in between with the creaminess and generous layered amount of toppings, while the only difference is that they add red bean.  i think i've tried most of the 'popular' bingsu places, so it's safe for me to say this place is definitely underrated and a must try!"}
{"text":"Pros: Consistently good bingsu. Generous with toppings and not too sweet. The condensed milk comes on the side, so you get to control your sweetness levels which is great. Bingsu comes in a stainless steel bowl that somehow seems to keep the contents cool and delays the melting. Would say that stainless steel bowl is unique to Snow Time thus far, haven't seen it at the Cups or the Korean bingsu places at Yonge and Finch. 

Cons: Long wait times during weekends due to small seating space. Also, service isn't too fast either so be prepared to wait a while for your fantastic bowl of bingsu. 

Tip: Make sure you check to see if this place is open, they tend to close randomly (holidays, breaks, ceiling leaks, etc). No signs of notice on their social media pages either, just a written sign plastered on their front door. Happened to me five times over the summer,  Dear Fro was not open yet at the time so it wasn't like I had a bingsu alternative in Scarborough. Massively disappointing then. But maybe things have changed, maybe they'll be willing to stay open more now since bingsu competition has ramped up in this plaza."}
{"text":"Tldr: Korean shaved ice dessert place, great consistency and flavors, on the pricier end, would recommend! 

Snow time is a small little dessert place that serves korean shaved ice, and they also offer snacks if you're feeling hungs. Never had korean bingsoo before, so this was a new and unique experience for me! 

Came here recently with my girlfriend and we ordered a small matcha red bean (The one with the mochi). They really packed the cup to the point where some of the toppings were falling out of the cup as we were bringing it to our table. The shaved ice itself had a consistency that reminded me of dippin dots as it held it's solid state when scooped up, but instantly melts the moment you out it in your mouth. It had a delightful creamy flavor, with a hint of vanilla in it. The shaved ice flavors did blend well with the toppings of the matcha, redbean, and mochi though i will be sure to try the other style of matcha redbean where the matcha flavors are incorporated into the shaved ice itself rather than just the powder on top. 

Overall, i enjoyed my experience here at Snowtime. I did not feel super heavy or bloated after having the bingsoo even though it looked like alot haha. It wasnt too sweet and had the right amount of flavor as well. The bingsoos are on the pricier end but it was definitely worth the unique experience. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a rare gem within Scarborough. 
The bing soo is made with milk instead of water and you can definitely taste the creaminess. 

The place is almost always busy as it is a smaller place seating around 20-30 max and people tend to stay and chill after they're done. 

The bing soo does take some time to come - approximately 10 minutes. But damn is it worth it. 

You grab a menu and seat yourself when you come in and when you order, they will give you the little vibrating machine that lights up and .. Obviously vibrates when your order is ready. 

It is a more pricier place but the small can definitely fill 2 people and the large can fill 4. 

I personally love the mango. I tried the mixed fruit but all the flavours (especially the syrup) mixing together was nooooot working out for me. 

I also get the matcha latte. It is soo perfect to just have a chat over. 

Overall, if wait times weren't long and if they could drop the prices just by a little - it would def be the true dessert joint in town."}
{"text":"Best bingsu in Toronto! Not like other bingsu place where as you eat, the ice on the buttom gets plain in taste. But at snow time it's good all the way through"}
{"text":"While there has been much more hype for one of its competitors, Snow Time for me, is hands-down, one of the best Korean bingsu places with bursting flavour and many choices. I also appreciate the fact that they have 3 sizes now versus the first visit I had, where it was just one size.

I had the following:

1. Injeolmi (Small)
For those of you who don't know what injeolmi is, it's a soybean powder that is used often in Korean cuisine. The flavour profile is a lot milder than what you would imagine, but the subtle soy taste is what draws me in. Personally, I think the amount of condensed milk in the bingsu is perfect, but my friend said that he would prefer more because it's a bit lacking.

2. Matcha (Small)
So if there is some confusion when you arrive and take a look at the menu, it's normal - I had to ask what the difference between the 2 matcha options too! In brief, one option has the green tea ice cream on top, but the bingsu is the regular flavour. The other matcha option is to have matcha flavoured bingsu on the inside versus the regular, which was what we opted for. Instead of the ice cream though, we wanted more mochi; I like that they're flexible with customizations. Can I just say that the matcha flavour bingsu is EXACTLY how I like my matcha? Bitter matcha but with sweetness from the condensed milk - it was perfect and it was heaven! My friend also really liked it because they gave a side of extra condensed milk for this bingsu option (I'm guessing because some might find the matcha too bitter, but not me!).

Overall, the injeolmi was a bit underwhelming but the matcha was worth the 20 minute wait! The cafe is small and might be able to fit around 25 people at one time, at the most, but that adds to the cozy ambience that I like. Needless to say though, I will come back again and again, so do me and yourself a favour and go check them out RIGHT NOW!"}
{"text":"Since it was dead winter and icy outside, we came here for their injeolmi toast instead of their bingsoo. The toast is a traditional toast made with rice cake topped with some soy bean powder and condensed milk . We ordered that with some coffee drinks. I am likely not the best judge of the injeolmi toast since i've never had it before and dont have anything to compare to. It was alright and heavier than i had expected. The drinks were not good. I will need to come back for their shaved ice in the summer to really get the full picture."}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time yesterday and really liked it! I will definitely be back to try some other flavours. I had the matcha red bean. The matcha isn't the best flavour, but I still liked it. The large size is very shareable and the combination of textures is really interesting.


Update: I've now been back 3 more times and have tried the injeolmi, Oreo, and mango. Injeolmi and Oreo are the best so far!"}
{"text":"Came after having AYCE to try out the hype of this location. After trying it, it did not taste any special as any other milk ice dessert. It was good but not a dessert place I would want to really head back to, as there are better locations :)"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for a table, unless you show up close to closing. That's exactly what I did by coming in at 10pm on a Saturday, but your luck may vary. The setup is a bit confusing as the staff aren't actually waiters. When they aren't full I'm not sure if you just stroll in and take a seat or wait to be seated because I saw people doing both. Regardless, the process after that is the same: go up to the counter, order your bingsu, pay, take your beeper, and wait until it buzzes. Unfortunately it seems that about 1-2 hours before closing they run out of fruit. I was a bit disappointed by that, but the injeolmi red bean was so good that I forgot about it. As a dessert, I split a regular size, however I'm pretty sure I could've eaten it by myself. I will definitely be back in the future to try out one of the fruit bingsu!"}
{"text":"Best bingsoo I've come across in Toronto. Came here several times for their mango bingsoo and I absolutely loved it. This is a small place so expect line ups during the weekends and after dinner-time. They offer a variety of other flavours such as matcha, chocolate banana, Oreo, and mixed berries. You get to pick the size as well: small, regular, and large. Service here is standard and more like what you would get from a fast food restaurant. You place your order at the counter and receive this gadget that vibrates or rings to inform you to pick your food up at the front.

Unlike other bingsoo or Chinese shaved ice desserts, the \"snow\" or the ice is extremely light and fluffy. After finishing the top portion of ice cream and toppings, there's a nice surprise of more creamy goodness underneath the layers of snow.

Would love to come here again in the future and try their matcha flavour!"}
{"text":"So Soft! So Fluffy! So Light! Just like Snowflakes!

I love shaved ice and Snow Time is probably the best in Toronto! 

I arrived on a weekday around 3:30 pm and the place is 70% full! From order to when my Injeomi Bingsoo with Red Bean ($8.95) was around 10 - 15 minutes. So don't come here if you are in a rush.

I did not expect shaved ice would taste like this. The ice was shaved so small and delicate. There were layers of toppings in between and I love the chewiness of rice cake and the crunchiness of the almond! 

I ate the whole thing by myself... but it is good enough to share as a snack. The staff is more than happy to give you a takeaway cup if you ended up not finishing.

$10 tax in might be a little pricey. but worth the occasional indulgence! 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I wasnt a huge fan of shaved ice in toronto until i discovered this place. This is one of few places that offer authentic korean shaved ice like the ones I've have in Seoul. There are lots of options and toppings, and the servings are very generous. The atmosphere of the cafe is very quaint and comfortable. Its a great hangout place for friends and couples."}
{"text":"Snow Time is always busy with line ups. The store is constantly playing Korean shows or K pop performance in the background. I believe the owner is Chinese. Realistically, who cares about ethnicity as long as it is yummy!  Delicious Korean style shaved ice. Plenty of flavours to choose from. Price ranges from 7.99 and upwards. It's a slightly healthier alternative to heavy creamy western style desserts.

My favourite is matcha with ice cream and original with soy powder. Yum! Definitely a great treat! Treat yo'self!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times and its alright. My family loved it, but it wasnt my thing. Its more pricey than expected and they usually run out of things (like fruit) really quickly. Not worth the hype in my opinion, especially since they have such a limited selection and always run out."}
{"text":"Came here to try some bingsu since it's bingsu long since I had one.  (Don't hate on the pun lol)

I had the matcha bingsu which was delish cus it wasn't too sweet.  Also ordered their matcha latte which was also yummy.  

They have other flavours like mango and Oreo.  A great place to have dessert and spend quality time with friends for sure."}
{"text":"I've always wondered what was so good about korean bingsoo, but now I know. It's a lot different then what you'd expect. The ice is shaved very thin, almost like fluffy snow, and when you take a bite, you aren't getting chunks of ice. You get some creamy mixture in your mouth. I got the Injeolmi bingsoo. It's a powdered soy bean, which worked well with the ice as it doesn't overpower the cream flavored ice. They also added in chunks of mochi, red bean and some almond slices.

The staff members are so nice at this place and helpful. The place is also very cutely decorated with cushions and such. A very good place to sit and catch up with a friend. The only issue with the place is the heat! The place is so stuffy, I don't know how you can sit there and eat! I ordered take out, but I still felt so stuffy while waiting. The price for the shaved ice is a bit pricey, but I would say it's worth it to try at least once.

Also, if you're into the korean dramas and such, they were playing DOTS on one screen (with chinese subtitles) and big bang music on the other screen."}
{"text":"This place really does deserve all the good reviews it's been getting. It is a bit small, but there are a decent amount of seats available. Service is very friendly. 

My friends and I decided to share two regular patbingsu (we got mango and mixed fruit). Both were very creamy and delicious. The mangos were sweet, and the more you mixed the patbingsu together, the better is tasted. They are a bit pricey, but the size is quite generous. 
One of my friends also got a pom tea (we figured out pom most likely stood for pomelo), and I only had a sip of it, but from what I tasted, it was a pleasant drink. 
Snow Time has a few menu items yet to be released, so I look forward to coming back to try them out sometime. Best of luck to them!

*My only complaint is that their logo is written is comic sans, but the interior has different font. It has everything to do with personal preference, but I think comic sans is ugly. I really wish they had used a different font."}
{"text":"Best shaved ice I've had yet!! I love how soft the shaves are and absolutely love that there are toppings below and in between the shaved ice. I got the injeomi bingsu (regular size) which came with soybean powder, mini mochi bites, red bean, and topped with shaved almond bits. There was more than enough for one person, but I wouldn't say there's enough for two. 

I also go the injeomi toast which without the condensed milk tasted a little bland so I highly encourage you to pour that stuff all over it. Unfortunately I couldn't finish the toast because the bingsu was way too filling but it's definitely good on its own!

Staff was very friendly and calmly helped accommodate our visit despite the heavy lineup. I think we waited around 30 minutes in total to be seated and given our food? I guess it wouldn't be so bad if the place was a bit bigger since it felt a little claustrophobic, but given how good the food was, I'd go back for sure. But maybe next time during a less busy time"}
{"text":"Finally got the time to write something about Snow Time(Visited on 11/29/16).  My friend and I went at dinner time which was not busy. Service was prompt and friendly.  As we tried the Matcha Redbean Bingsoo and Iced Pom drink, both met at our expectations. Shaved milk was good and different from the Taiwanese theme of \"Pau Bing\" LoL.  Would come back and try the Oreo Bingsoo. Happy Nom ming~!!

Food 4/5
Service 4.5/5
Atmosphere: 4.5/5

{"text":"This is a great spot for Korean shaved ice and some snacks. The shaved ice is nicely sized and a regular size can definitely be shared between two people. I got a matcha red bean and got a taste of their signature Injeomi (brown soy powder) shaved ice. The flavours and toppings were great and nicely complimented by the delicate shaved ice (which actually looks like snowflakes). It's nice to eat shaved ice that doesn't turn into a watery mess after 1 minute!

The menu needs some updating as they actually do sell Korean fried chicken. While the Gangjeong flavour is nice (not too spicy), it was a little expensive for the small portion that they offered. 

The toast was pretty standard compared to other Asian dessert places. 

This place gets busy at night (and the parking lot is terrible), so try to get here early! Also, make sure to ask them which flavours of shaved ice are available as some have been discontinued."}
{"text":"Fluffy, light and not too sweet. I'm a fan! They are generous with toppings and gave us condensed milk on the side to let us gage the sweetness level. I tried the Oreo and Matcha flavoured bingsu and I loved them both. Can't wait to go back and try the others!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place!! . I ordered their mango shaved ice and it was rlly good. Staff were really friendly too:)"}
{"text":"Very cute little Bingsu cafe.

Upon entering, you'll see that the place has various stuffed animals and seating, and they even have a swinging chair. I tried the mango bingsu and I absolutely loved it. The bingsu is super smooth and creamy, and the ice doesn't have that sharp/hard feeling like some other bingsu places have. The mango also tasted really fresh and it went very well with the milkyness of the shaved ice. I definitely had a good first experience here and I would for sure come back to try their other flavours!"}
{"text":"It is cool seeing so many Korean dessert places open up nowadays. Tried this Co looking place for a tasty bingsu. I thought it was pretty average compared to others I've tried. Firstly, long wait times, which is usually expected for bingsu places because the establishments usually only have 1 snow machine. The bingsu itself was pretty lacking. From first glance it is very pretty and appetizing.. then you realize the bowl is so small and the bingsu is stacked up so high, everything starts falling when you eat. Especially if you get something like the oreo bingsu, the crumbs literally crumble off the bowl lol. 

The most important part, the 'snow' lacked sweetness or any flavour at all. Which means, they watered down the milk a lot and did not add any condensed milk. So once all your toppings are gone, ur left with bland snow. They atleast layer the toppings in the snow so the chances of running into this predicament is low. They also give you a small shot glass of condensed milk(a bit watered down) which helps keep the bingsu nice and sweet.

The toppings are a bit sparse.. we had the Oreo one, it comes with one oreo, black cookie crumbs and some whipped cream. Other toppings like ice cream are extra(which is a free topping in other places)

Overall an interesting experience"}
