{"text":"The server and the chef seemed to have a different understanding of what came in the Dineen Steak sandwich I ordered. In the end, I didn't get it the way I wanted, but it was still really good. My gf liked the eggplant sandwich too. My sweet potato fries were a bit burnt, but most were still edible. Everything was tasty, the service was friendly and the prices were decent, so I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"now opened for its 5th month, located right beside Dineen Coffee, Fiore is a great place, with a condense menu, flavorful food, cute patio, and well priced in accordance to its area!
Their food, and prices are bang on! 
I ended up having their Crispy Eggplant sandwich served on a ciabatta bread! the cheese and tomato really complimented the freshness of the meal, added with some crunch of the eggplant.  I ended up upgrading from regular fries to Sweet potato fries! damn! its just as good as Fresh On Bloor's sweet potato fries.  This dish was a 4.5/5

My buddies had the italian sausage rappini sandwich we he gave a 4/5.

Their daily special jerk chicken with rice and peas! 5/5 the chicken was so tender and full of flavors, probably one of the best jerk chickens ive had...not necessarily your typical jerk though.
 
 Overall the service was great! and our servers were helpful! I will be back for another visit!!!"}

Weissbier was out"}
{"text":"This place has a great location and patio seating but the food is disappointing. There's not much in terms of healthy options and prices reflect the cost of real estate more than the food quality. Location is currently next to massive construction site so the patio might get a bit gritty. Washrooms are borderline acceptable but small."}
