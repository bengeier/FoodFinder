{"text":"Great food. Consistent and quick take out or dine in. I've gone here for over 15 years and have never been dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"found shared of glass in rice same color as the rice but these ppl were great with a refund"}
{"text":"Delicious, inexpensive and quick! 

My favorites are the Szechuan Chicken and Pineapple Chicken."}
{"text":"Save your money.. Idk why I consider yelp reviews, I think most of these jackholes have no idea what decent product is.. Szechuan beef, sweet and sour chicken and hot and sour soup... The beef was flavorless, any taste at all was not good.. The chicken was an orange juice reduction sugar bomb.. Fried rice average at best, and the soup... It's not hot, it's no where close to sour, it had one piece of pork in the quart, and had cabbage? Seriously... I've had exponentially better food elsewhere at the same price. Friendly and quick... But it ends there."}
{"text":"Wonderful little place for Chinese take out. Always takes just 10 minutes! My boyfriend and I usually split the general tso chicken combo with an extra egg roll and the steamed potstickers! Never a bad meal!"}
{"text":"We have been buying here for years and have enjoyed it especially for price.

However this week (11/6) we found out there is new ownership and the service, and a lesser extent the food, shows this.

We will give them one more chance under this new ownership before start looking for a new place.

12/11 a month later and service is still slow even though there wasn't much business going on. I had to wait an extra 14 min. The food is also subpar from what it used to be. We will likely be searching for others in the area again."}
{"text":"I've been eating Chinese food since 1962 and this is tied with one other experience as being the lousiest of all.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Great food. My favorite is the won ton hot pot, but they also make great fried rice. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This used to be the place 2 go for Chinese food. I would travel past 4 or 5 other places just get food here. They seem to have slightly changed their food. It just isn't as good as it used to be. Also they have raised the prices and shrunk the portion size. I guess I will be finding another Chinese place."}
{"text":"Have gone there for years getting carry out. The food was good so you have to overlook the sad depressing decor. Last night got my usual chicken and vegetables and the chicken was spoiled.
I won't go back. Too bad because I was a regular."}
{"text":"Flavorless bland food. I got the generals chicken and it had zero heat! Egg roll was very basic and it was not crisp at all due to it being served on top of the rice. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Prices, Great, Fast Service!

We LOVE going to this place!  Since my boyfriend and I have been dating (almost 4 years), we have always been regulars when we lived in Eastlake.  Now that we're in Mentor, we rarely go, but when we do, it's always great!"}
