{"text":"just recently opened and I gave it my three strikes and you're out policy. they are out. ran out of my draft and charged full price for bottles. not my fault your out of my draft. next time out of my draft and only one bottle left. hopefully they will get the orders down. also charging strip prices in a neighborhood location. if you want to charge strip prices, move to the strip. I won't be back but I wish them luck."}
{"text":"I love Michael T's! Dueling piano line up for weekends and half of all of the Tapas and appetizers from 2 to 6 every single day!
For the entree, I always go for the ribeye and loaded baked potato or the salmon in white clam sauce. I highly recommend this place to all my friends!

{"text":"First time trying this place. I've been to many steakhouses and this is a one of the better ones out there. Found this place on Groupon and many times Groupon = a desperate attempt to sell crappy food and service for a place that needs customers. NOT HERE!!! Brian P. was an AWESOME server and very attentive. The food quality was perfect, the steak was cooked to a textbook medium rare temp (which many places screw up), and the cheesecake is simply the best! The La Terre cab was very tasty! 

Come here and ask for Brian. You will NOT be disappointed. I'm from So Cal and I will definitely return when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a new Bar & Restaurant in the southwest of Las Vegas to be checked out. This place is awesome, with friendly staff,  great ambiance in a smoke free Dining Room. The Menu has a great selection for each taste...I personally love the juicy burgers and ribs.  Happy Hour its every day 2pm - 6pm when appetizers & tapas are half price and $2 off beer. Give it a try and I'm sure you will be back..."}
{"text":"This is by far the best spot in Vegas especially on the SW side of town. Excellent customer service. Mary was our server and was spot on. She knew the products and was very helpful. Such a pleasant attitude making our meal taste better. Ginger as well as the other staff members were too wonderful people. The food quality was 2nd to none. All fresh, hot and exactly what I ordered. My wife who is super maticulous was in heaven. I highly recommend this place to enjoy the music, atmosphere, food and overall ambiance. We will be back!

{"text":"This place was a very pleasant surprise, Carla and Holly were great, very friendly and attentive. The food was excellent sometimes it's very hard to find above average bar food but this place is top notch was absolutely amazing a couple dishes were cold, we mentioned it to the bartender and she profusely apologized and the chef sent out a complimentary  dessert. Me and my husband truly appreciated the sentiment, and their effort to make it right. It was our first time here tonight and we will definitely be back, great food great drinks, great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place for my husband's birthday. Wow, what a surprise! Low key but very nice and relaxing atmosphere. NY steak was very flavorful and tasty. Had cheesecake for dessert and it was smooth and melted in my mouth good! Jessica, our server was very attentive and friendly. Will be back soon to try the other dishes they have."}
{"text":"I went there with my family. we had hamburgers, they were pretty good, and our waitress was very nice. only bad part was the music they play! it was horrible! freakin john Denver, ABBA and video killed the radio star. 2 stars deducted for the crappy music!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place and decided to give it a try! Such a great atmosphere, nice servers and bartenders. Awesome decor. The happy hour menu was what brought us in! GREAT tapas. Highly recommend the steak and chimichurri. Overall, had a really nice lunch here :) would come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Service was not good. Food was average at best. Service really determined the 2 Star. We ordered fries,an appetizers and a beer. Fries were normal bar fries, chicken skewers were heavily seasoned with Rosemary but nothing else. There is a special going on for gambling, spend roughly $50 and get $50 gambling credit. When I lose the $50 and the $50 credit, normally I would expect my drinks comped, but gambling does not seem to comp any drinks. 3rd time our bartender came around I ordered a shot of Jamison but the bartenders completely forgot."}
{"text":"My favorite place. Staff and bartenders keep the food and drinks going.  Brian is managing this team well. Food is always great.
Always a great time."}
{"text":"Mary (server) was very pleasant and polite. The food was decently priced and very tasty. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Valentines night we had a outstanding dinner show and even got a rose   We brought friends and family and they all had a great time, prices are great the owners are outstanding as well as the staff. The show with Chase Brown was amazing Kinda place where everyone knows your name. The owners Michael T and Mary Ellen are the best."}
{"text":"The food service was rough, took an extremely ling time to order, a long time to get the food n apparently paying w cash is a problem because it took s very long time to get change. The pork pizza was tasty though, hot as hell but tasty"}
{"text":"My girl and I have driven past this place quite a few times and keep saying we needed to go in there but it keeps changing names...well we finally made it in to find out it's been under this new ownership/name for only 7 months and we hope this one will stay!! Tom gave us great service and the food was delicious. I had the bbq bacon burger which was cooked to perfection and the side salad was a good mix of greens and not just iceberg, which I love...my girl had the side of Mac and cheese...awesome and the chipotle chicken empanadas which I felt could have had more chicken but were delicious none the less. The menu was limited on the graveyard shift but I'm looking forward to tasting more of this menu."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here the first time was on their soft open did not have a good experience then either waited over 30 minutes 4 for well drinks from the bar. Ordered off the appetizer menu which took close to 45 minutes to get our food but we figured soft open maybe they just working The Kinks out so we gave him a second chance. Same thing this time  close to 25 minutes for a Jack and Coke, rum and coke and to mojitos. appetizers came out in about 15 minutes which in all fairness the appetizers were good. I ordered the bone in ribeye which came without any sides for $35 which I have gladly paid in the past at higher-end steakhouses for an excellent cut of meat cooked perfectly. This was not the case here ordered medium rare after an hour the steak came out basically raw in the middle slightly warmed through. The cut of meat itself wasn't Prime wasn't Choice barely select full of Gristle horribly tough piece of meat definitely not worth the money or the wait. My daughter ordered the prime flat iron cooked well ,which evidently she got my medium rare when she eventually got her knife through this piece of shoe leather blood ran out onto her plate which ruined her appetite of course she sent it back. The owner eventually came over and apologized said they'd only been open a week which has I said we were there a month ago. Told her yeah it was a little ridiculous to wait over an hour for our meal which realistically couldn't have taken over 20 minutes to prepare considering there was only six other tables occupied in the restaurant at the time. She told me that she looked at the ticket and it only been put in a half an hour ago basically calling me a liar. Sorry for the extremely long review but be warned extremely overpriced and not worth it."}
{"text":"Our family was looking for a new place to eat and came upon Michael T's. Like many yelpers, we look it up and saw great reviews. I was looking forward to food considering the hype, however my family did not get beyond drinks. 

The location did not have a wait time, however they did have large party tables already seated. We walked in at 8:21pm  and 10 minutes later the waiter finally walked over and took our drink orders. When the waiter returned he left the drinks and said he would be back to take our food order. We continued to wait 20 minutes for the waiter to return and take our food order, but we were able to see he continued to attend a table of 7. After waiting for over 30 minutes and still not able to place our order we decided to leave. 

The girl at the entrance informed the manager or owner of our situation and as we walked out the manager said she could take our order. We were just done at this point and did not want to continue to wait even longer for our food to come out. The waiter we had hopefully becomes more aware of his guest and provides better service and hopefully this is an isolated incident. My family of 5 (3 young girls) will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Great music , above average food fun inviting atmosphere, but poor service . Three bartenders / 3 guest .... over 10 min wait to be acknowledged . Never checked back on our party . Karla was way to busy on her phone and admiring her outfit to be bothered with things such as guest service . It took another 10 min to get a check and pay ( julie was back in the kitchen & karla was back on her phone ) Now I no why only 3 people in the bar at 830-1030 on a Friday night ."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to come in here and I am so glad I finally stopped in! We came in on a Saturday afternoon for some lunch and discovered it was happy hour (2-6! daily!!!) They have a huge variety of apps/tapas that were half off as well as some drink specials. Everything we ordered was AMAZING and such a steal for the price. Chips & Salsa - the salsa had a nice kick and there were plenty of fresh chips. Chicken skewers- this was our \"healthy\" item - literally just grilled chicken with a dipping sauce - not bad. Wings - mango habanero.  The fried pickles were fried to perfection (alot of breading which was delicious!) The sauce for dipping was addictive too! Our server, Richard, gave top quality service! Highly highly impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Two stars because my husband enjoyed his burger, said it was cooked well. One star for my baked potato and ZERO STARS for my $11 Cobb Wedge salad that was a half a head of lettuce, a quarter of a brown half rotten avocado, a hard boiled egg that was merely sliced in half, a tomato cut into six wedges, and two full unchopped slices of bacon.... basically I had to cut my entire salad myself..... with a butter knife. Oh, and the blue cheese dressing was warm. Gross. If I wanted to chop my own salad I would have made it at home. We'll try this place one more time, but I don't have high hopes for it. One star for a restaurant that isn't smokey, in spite of having a bar."}
{"text":"Love this place. Reasonably priced and everything has been fantastic. Rachel is really sweet and was an awesome server. Definitely recommend the Michael Ts pizza, bacon wrapped dates, and the grilled artichoke. The steak is on par with a fancy, expensive steakhouse but the atmosphere is casual and relaxed."}
{"text":"Fooooooooooood I didn't get me food for over 2 hours and try to say busy but noooooooo seats not even all full riiiiiiiiiiii I am anger"}
{"text":"What a fun and delicious place! We had a great time and our server was super friendly! The steaks were cooked perfectly and delicious! The Groupon deal got us in the door the and food, service and atmosphere is what is going to bring us back soon! I can't wait to go back and try more! I want to try the dueling pianos night!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & service! We were here during their soft-opening and Brian was our waiter. Steaks cooked to perfection, a peppercorn sauce served on the side, oh so good. A bottle of White Zinfandel to top of the meal, perfecto! Along with a house salad, & cheesecake to end our meal. Wow! Our new favorite place!!! Music was exceptional..."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! I really love the whiskey burger, their tapas are to die for, my favorite so far is the bacon wrapped dates  the Mexican corn is so good too! Bar is open 24/7 the servers are super nice and  have great suggestions! The cheesecake is homemade and probably one of the best ones in town! This is our new favorite spot near home!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time dinning and we had a wonderful time. Live music with \"Chase Brown\", got me out of my seat dancing Lol 
Food was amazing,  excellent service. We were given the perfect amount of time to enjoy our appetizers, and cocktails before being served our dinner. Salmon and Ribs were amazing...
Thank you! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Wish I could write a good review but my first experience was terrible !! This is a bar and no more than that people so do not waist your time on the food . I ordered chicken skewers for my appetizer .. pretttyyy easy right ? Nope ! My first bite was RAW CHICKEN and instantly made my stomach nauseous For the entrees , I was half way done with my ribs by the time my girlfriends fried empanadas came out witch doesn't seem normal or make our first and last experience any better . There was no business like customer service and by that I mean my bill still remained the same as if I didn't stick RAW CHICKEN in my mouth  This is \"glorified bar food \"  on a bad day and nothing more with a rookie chef ."}
{"text":"The service at the bar was subpar and the food for happy hour was so nasty we hardly ate any of it.We literally saw people come in and leave after looking around.Will not be returning ever."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse to go to! If you're ever looking for a place to eat some steak, ribs, burgers, or pizza and watch some sports I would really recommend going to this place! The food is very satisfying and filling! Their tapas and appetizers were very superb. Their stuffed mushrooms, tacos, and honey sriracha wings are my favorites. My waiter Bryan was extremely qualified his service was one of the best I've had. The staff was friendly and and respectful. The live music was spectacular! I attended one of their dueling pianos and their valentine's show and I was in complete awe! I would definitely attend this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Newly opened place in the southwest area of Vegas. High quality food; my steak was excellent! Service was a little slow though. I'd definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"I love MT's!!! I absolutely adore our bartender Alicia. She always knows our drinks by heart and give us really personal service. My husband and I come in for lunch once a week just to hang out with her. And the tacos... I LOVE the tacos! Fun place, definitely sharing this gem with friends and family."}
{"text":"I stopped by and ordered the filet, medium rare. The steak was cooked properly, but had almost no flavor. There was no pepper rub or anything to give the steak any \"kick.\" I realize that a filet has a very mild flavor, but this was beyond \"mild\" and more \"bland.\" A small ramekin was served along with the steak, and I thought \"Oh, maybe this will be a nice chimichurri to add some tastiness to the steak\". I was disappointed to learn that the sauce served was A1. Perhaps I am a bit too discriminating about steaks, but I think of A1 as nothing more than overrated ketchup. Normally, when a server asks if I need any steak sauce I think to myself \"If it needs steak sauce, then I'm sending it back.\" I was so surprised to see A1 served with a filet. The service was top notch, all of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Their excellent service, however, could not make up for the mediocre steak. Seriously, Outback Steakhouse has a better filet, and for the same ~$30 price Outback at least includes sides. Michael T's steaks are served a la carte, so a traditional steak dinner will cost about $50 per person. The price is not overly expensive, but again, the quality of the food is not commensurate with its cost. The decor was nice, and the people were friendly, but I won't be dining at Michael T's in the future."}
{"text":"This place is good. But it's confusing..  And hopefully I'll explain why. We had a groupon, so we decided to check it out this evening. The groupon was for two steak dinners, with a house salad to share, grilled veggies, loaded baked potatoes, bottle of white or red, and a slice of cheesecake to share. 

Being the foodies we are, we decided to also try an appetizer, and a tapas. We chose the fried pickles, and bacon wrapped dates. The fried pickles were less than satisfying. They were whole spears, with a very pancake-y batter, that had little flavor, and seemed a bit undercooked. Either way, not terrible.. but I would pass on them next time. The bacon wrapped dates however were fantastic!  Absolutely give these a try!  Next came the salad, which was very good..  Spring mix, with wedge tomatoes, beets, and a house vinaigrette. The vinaigrette could have been tossed with the salad a little better, as the majority of it was lost at the bottom. However, like I said.. We quite enjoyed it. 

The main course came, and let me tell you.. the steaks were perfect!  We both ordered mid rare, and they did not disappoint one bit. Great flavor, great charring, just honestly great overall. The accompanying sides were fantastic as well.

The slice of cheesecake was next. It was a generous size, and very good. I could have done without the cloying strawberry sauce however. But the nice sliced strawberries, and light fresh whipped cream was welcomed. 

Now on to the ambiance. It was... confusing. This is a brand new place, so I'll forgive it as I know growing pains. Anyway, we just weren't sure what this place was trying to be. A formal steakhouse, a nice upscale restaurant, or a bar and grill. The service was exceptional, as the wine was presented to us, and opened table side. The waiter was very attentive, and took care of our needs quickly and efficiently. Now what made this confusing was... Our water glasses were plastic, coca-cola glasses. Which is perfectly fine, but confusing as the service didn't really suggest that this was a casual dining experience. Also the choice of music in the restaurant, again.. it didn't scream of upscale, more casual dining. I guess it's possible that the waiter just took his job VERY seriously, and wanted to give us the best possible experience, which he certainly did. 

Overall, this wouldn't be my first choice for a bite to eat, as we live clear across town. But I would love to try some other things on the menu, I'd also love to be there when the dueling pianos are playing.. I'm sure that's a fun time. 

We did stop into the bar for a quick $10 on keno, and poker.. but didn't order any drinks. It was completely closed off from the restaurant, as smoking is allowed in there. 

I wish this place the best, I think they have the recipe for success if I'm basing it on the food, and service. Even if they have some minor identity problems."}
{"text":"was in for the golden knights game and had a blast. was very busy place. we found out it was happy hour so ordered quite a bit of food, took most home. food took about 20 minutes and server was apologizing but being in the business we completely understood. food was delicious and everyone was so nice. will be back for sure!!! go Knights go!!!!!!  margaritas were also yummy :)"}
{"text":"Huge dining section. Warm relaxed vibes wrap around you the instant you walk through the door."}
{"text":"Very nice place, great food!
Friendly staff nice, the decor is very nice. Good variety of food and tastes great, also very reasonable priced. 
Looks like this should be a more expensive restaurant but offers amazing value for the great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Wonderful food. Great atmosphere. Michael T's never disappoints. Awesome time. Will definitely be coming back. The dueling pianos were a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Hopefully just kinks to work out of a newly opened establishment and not their standard operation or they won't be around long. Almost walked out with out gambling or eating after waiting to be greeted by a female bartender that was too busy chatting with friends to acknowledge a new customer. Food was sub par; cold buns on tasteless dry sliders, salmon overcooked, items missing from order. Questionable drink comp policy after playing $40 & being told 1 of the 2 drinks would be deducted to compensate for the poor food; can't get 2 drinks comped for $40 in play? Might give another chance in a month or two to see if they work out the kinks...if they are still open."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I'm a night owl but it is so hard to find good food in a bar after midnight that is not wings, nachos and mozzarella sricks. The bartenders are friendly and the food is fantastic.  Happy hour is 02:00 am to 06:00 am.  The appetizers and tapas are 50% off.  Maybe I'm a dork but I love the fact that I have an app on my phone that controls the jukebox.  The chef Mel makes amazing food and you can tell tell he puts his heart into making it. I think I have eaten the ceviche everynight for about a month. This place is not your usual 24 hour gaming bar.  It is definitely a treat."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. Everything is sooo good! My daughter had Mac n cheese and even that was good! We split some apps and everything was amazing and split a burger and it was delicious! I'm looking forward to coming back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing first experience. First off, the servers and bartenders are amazing. Second, the Food that came out was delicious. I was told they have an executive chef that oversees the kitchen, so you know the food is going to come out great. I will definitley be going back. It's my new place to drink, eat, and watch sports! Thanks Michael T's"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to stop by this place and check it out since we all live relatively close. We didn't know what we were hungry for, so we decided to order some appetizers and sides and share everything. The food was really good. Our server (Karla) also made sure our drinks were full. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed. The food was decent but my burger was really over cooked. The price was too high for a bar like this, especially in comparison to the food quality."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon for this amazing restaurant, no hidden charges, the food is delicious, steak, baked potato that was so tasty, but the service made the experience out of this world! They even have Tabasco sauce!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great atmosphere!   Alicia, their day girl, is awesome!  Always friendly and on point when I've came in!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for loose slots, delicious food and crazy fun entertainment! I came to Michael T's after hearing about the dueling pianos on Saturday nights. My entire family came (a party of 9)and while the dining room was busy we were smart enough to make a reservation. A definite must if you plan on coming for dueling pianos cause the place fills up and it was easy to see why. 
We were immediately seated by a friendly hostess and our drink order was taken right away. We had a couple stragglers in our party who arrived a bit late but the hostess and server didn't miss a beat and got their drinks ordered right away. 
We treated ourselves to some specialty drinks and they didn't disappoint. Generously poured and delicious, they even come with seriously the cutest twist on a boring old cocktail umbrella. You gotta order a drink to see it. 
We got an appetizer-chips with guacamole and salsa. They give a pretty large portion of guacamole and it was good but the salsa tastes homemade and was excellent. I wish there had been a few more chips but it was a great start to our meal. 
So it was 2 for 1 in prime rib tonight and our entire party opted on this for the entree. I feel like I've never had a better prime rib anywhere-it even puts Lawry's to shame-I kid you not. It was cooked perfectly-just the right amount of pink and so incredibly flavorful. It had this heavenly edge that tastes so good-salty and crunchy and it worked so perfectly with the tenderness of the meat. The fat content was minimal so the cut was mostly meat and I appreciated the fact that I didn't have to cut around and through a ton of fat to get to the meat. The creamy horseradish was heavenly. It was served with some cooked-just-right asparagus as well as a really cool take on a baked potato. It was half of a large potato that seemed to have been baked with cheese and bacon on top and then drizzled with sour cream. It was moist and flavorful. The portions were very large and they left plenty to take home for tomorrow (or possibly, in my case, a late night snack cause I'm still thinking about that prime rib...). 
We decided to grab some dessert to share as a table and chose the creme brûlée cheesecake and the flourless chocolate cake. Both were incredible but I was a little more partial to the cheesecake. 
Our server was excellent-knowledgeable, attentive, professional and very kind and patient with our large party. The restaurant itself is gorgeous-a lower level that surrounds the pianos and a slightly elevated level with booths and tables. It's very tastefully decorated and has this sort of upscale vibe but it's anything but stuffy. 
We were so stoked about the dueling pianos and they were so fun and entertaining. Both performers sang an array of music-from oldies to rock to more current hip hop. It was great to see such a great variety of music and everyone in the restaurant sang together for some of the more popular songs. There's just something about a place that makes you feel like you know everyone there. 
There's a gaming area off to the right of the restaurant that has some really cool wall murals and although we didn't spend a lot of time in there, my husband dropped a $10 in one of the machines and walked out with plenty more than he came in with! Some other patrons commented that they've had some pretty consistent luck there. 
Michael T's is a place that has a little something for everyone-gaming, food, entertainment and plenty of TV's around for viewing sporting events. I'm already planning my next visit-we hear they do live music on Friday nights. Do yourself a favor and put this place at the top of your must go list. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Steak dinner for 2 was a bomb deals, was totally worth it  and I'm glad we chose this place for our Valentine's Day dinner. Great ambiance, live entertainment, and the food was worth $60 for 2! Even got a free rose from the live singer!"}
{"text":"Having a great time listening (and interacting with :) ) after a great dinner at Michael T's!!"}
{"text":"Meh. At best. 3 apps at happy hour took... 30 mins? Tacos so old under a heat lamp and gross we didn't eat them- so soggy we couldn't pick them up, tortilla torn. Mozzarella sticks on par with... drive through? Burgers... okay... check out meat to bun ratio. We were pumped based on reviews but shooters FILLED with ice. Bartender didn't know drink specials. Overall, mega disappointment. But we did only get drinks and apps.. and it's close to home. Happy hour was a let down, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Got to meet Mindy, Alicia, and Janda on my first visit. Everyone is so friendly! First thing you notice when walking is are the pianos. 

The menu has some interesting items that I'd like to come back and try. Settled for wings and empanadas. Was tempted to get the jambalaya, but I'll do that on my next visit. Wings were a good value, but I thought $8 for 2 empanadas was a bit pricey. 3 would have been perfect. 

The bar is nice and clean. Doesn't smell funky or have that spilled beer smell that some other places have. There are a lot of screens to watch sports. 

Overall I'd say it is a solid neighborhood bar. Fun and friendly bartenders really make your visit that much more enjoyable. Oh, and they have pineapple sour beer!!"}
{"text":"Came in there with my Mom visiting from Chicago. Right away we loved the décor with the Chicago Skyline! We were going to have dinner but my husband was later meeting us. I ended up having a burger at the bar and it was awesome! Cooked the way I asked and tasty. The burger is a test for me if I can stop in and get a great burger, I will be back. My husband had the sliders, and my Mom had soup and salad because we were eating later than she is used to. She couldn't stop talking about the Minestrone soup recommended by our bartender Janda.  She said besides the great taste, it came out of the kitchen hot, the way soup should be.  
We didn't gamble, but we will be back with friends to check that out after Mom goes back home.  
Janda made my Mom a Margarita, not from a mix but a real Margartia, she loved it! We ended up meeting Julie the other bartender and she was friendly and welcoming also. 
Staff and food can make or break a bar, this place has both for sure. Great personalities all the way around. Will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and i'm a fan. Tried their happy hour (2-6 PM) the first time. Half off all food items on their tapas and appetizer menus and $2 off on beers and well drinks. Love their mango habanero chicken wings and bacon wrapped dates. The steak chimichurri was just ok to me. Good flavor, but the steak was a bit chewy. The shrimp ceviche plate was quite bland, so I'd pass this one.

The second time, I tried their steak special for 2. For $59, you get a bottle of la terre wine (choose between cab, merlot, chardonnay, and white zin. We chose the cab and it was decent. We actually got another bottle as we were thirsty lol. They charged $21 for a $7 bottle of wine, but I guess still cheaper than most places.), a house salad (really good dressing), 2 New York steaks with baked potatoes and sauteed veggies (the steak was flavorful. Asked for a medium rare, but it came out more on the medium side, but still tasted good. Baked potatoes was loaded and delicious. Veggies had good flavor), and a house made New York cheesecake for dessert (I don't even like cheesecake, but this was good!) They happened to have a live singer (Chase Brown and he was great) when we had dinner there, so that was a bonus. 

Service was great. Had Virgil and Kara who were very friendly. Overall, I had good experiences both times I went there. Looking forward to frequenting this place more often."}
{"text":"We were in town for the week and wanted a good, reasonably priced steak and found this place. We ordered the streak, potato and salad and everything was absolutely delicious and the value was fantastic!  The atmosphere was very nice and not loud. I love this place and by far it was the best meal we've had since we've been here.  The service was also superb."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this place! Filet mignon, minestrone, artichoke, dates, mashed potatoes, salmon - all great and reasonably priced! We also received great customer service, very attentive."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here because she was craving steak and we stumbled across this place based on yelp reviews.   The place was nice.  It's a poker bar with a separate room for dining.  The ambiance was more date like so I felt under dressed in my gym clothes lol.   I quickly realized the place was chill.  Server was sweet but I never got my salad and I don't even believe she remembered I ordered one.  

Our food came.   I got a filet, Baked potato, and veggies.  It was good BUT  over cooked, I ordered Med. I got Med well in the center and well on the ends. Still good. My daughters steak was huge.  We got her the NY.  It was under cooked.  We ordered Med well and it was right at Med and some places a little under.  Obviously they mixed up the temps.  She left a lot of steak between fat and blood.  I tried to help eat it.  I didn't wanna waste money ( we opted for fries instead of mashed potatoes and had to pay $4 upcharge to switch a carb for a carb) I thought that was crazy since it's literally a potato but I wasnt gonna say my kid can't have fries.  


Anyway I still tipped 20% , never complained about my missing salad or the meat both being cooked wrong, and I left full.  I won't ever go back unfortunately.   Worth a try for sure"}
{"text":"We came here for some happy hour food and enjoyed most of the dishes.  Chicken chipotle empanadas were tasty but didn't have too much chicken in the filling.  I didn't personally care for the wrap that was used for the empanada.  They top them with crema, lettuce and tomatoes.
The sliced flat iron steak was covered in an amazing chimichurri sauce.  We had sausages and peppers and it was obvious to me that they make all their own sausages because they were excellent.     My buddy thought the meatballs were \"meh\" but I enjoyed them.  They added a marinara sauce and shaved Parmesan atop the meatballs.  He makes his own meatballs using 3 different meats so that could affect his opinion.  We ordered sliders but they were very basic but didn't taste bad.  Just not amazing but you do get 4 of them.  We also enjoyed the happy hour wings with a honey sriracha sauce.  After dinner we had the flourless chocolate cake with some vanilla ice cream.  They drizzle chocolate and raspberry sauce all over the plate which seriously enhances the meal.

They make all of their own sauces here and seem to take pride in what they serve.  I had an excellent server named Jennifer.  I'm very impressed with this place as normally local gaming bar restaurants normally have very substandard food.  Ask for Jennifer, great service with a smile"}
{"text":"We came in with a group of 6 last night. The hostess greeted us right away and asked if we wanted to watch the sports on TV, my friend said it would be nice. I was very interested on their dueling piano but the hostess doesn't know exactly what time and which weekend they would perform.

Once we were seated, they brought us water and took our drink and appetizer orders. We missed the happy hour cos we got there after 6pm. I ordered a Bahama Colada and the rest of the group had their $2 beer specials for last night was the playoffs. My bf and I ordered pretty much everything on the Tapas menu. Some of the tapas on the menu were

~Bacon and shrimp mac and cheese $10
~Shrimp ceviche plate $10
~Stuffed mushroom $6
~Chicken wings $8

All the food we ordered came out on par. Everything was pretty flavorful and not too salty or under seasoned. Great atmosphere, and the lighting is perfect.  A few other parties were there that evening and were not loud. I would like to come back if they know when the dueling pianos' happening."}
{"text":"I came really just to visit my friend that works there!   We prefer beer, but they don't have anything we like.  So I had to get a wine, and hubby ordered a beer.  The place was pretty crowded in the bar area, because of the Golden Knights.  So we were able to visit with our friend a little bit.  (next time I won't go during the game)  We ordered food.  I got a burger, even though it took a long time to get, my burger was really good.  My husband got the steak sandwich.  It had more lettuce than steak.    We met the other bartenders, so service was great.  I would say order the burger with the pico de gallo.  and the bread was thin, and the burger was thick.  What a great combination! But the fries weren't that great!  I think they need to cook them longer, and they kinda tasted like some cheap off brand frozen fries.  But the burger was worth it."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise. I had seen the building and the previous occupant many times driving by, but now with the new owners I decided to stop in. The atmosphere is lovely. The bar is separated from the dining room with the two pianos there and the keyboard (!) in the bar definitely gives the musical touch. They also have some great murals of the Rat Pack and sports memorabilia. The Bartender, Chris, was just fantastic. A true professional. I wasn't drinking but they have a full bar and a great beer selection. What got me was the Tapas and appetizer menu. These are on special during happy hour and I tried several. Shrimp Macaroni and Cheese was great as was the Artichokes and Steak Chimichurri. All of these were recommended by Chris who had a great command of the menu and was very  entertaining to all of the guests at the bar. Great Service is indeed a joy to see in the Tavern Scene. I will be back for sure to visit Michael T's. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is good to watch the hockey games or any other pro games. They have excellent variety of food choices, accommodating bartenders and very affordable happy hour appetizers that are so yummy. This is our hockey game hangout."}
{"text":"Really hope this place survives here. Menu is perfect size with all essential bar food goodies, and they have a Tapas menu. Definitely try the fried meat balls w/ sriracha sauce. Mary was a wonderful waitress, and we had the pleasure of meeting chef Jose who was very hospitable."}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away with this place! Our servers Denise and Richard were  incredibly friendly and professional! We had a Groupon for the 2 steak dinners and couldn't of been happier with the quality of food! We also had the stuffed mushrooms and bacon wrapped dates, we recommend to anyone going there to try them! We will most definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Don't come here...I want this place all to myself!  Wonderful service/friendly prompt staff. Food is great and if you have room order THE best cheesecake EVER! Mmm I am in a food coma!"}
{"text":"$35 for their most expensive steak?? A la carte?? C'mon bro...I can make a better steak at home. It was half inch thick with barely a char on it. I'd expect this kind of steak at a chain restaurant. Rib eye was way sub par and so was the Mac n cheese. Wings were decent. All n all, I'm not going back there for a steak, which they say they are known for...false advertising...I'm sure their other food (sandwiches) are good...but nope on the steaks, they are laughable"}
{"text":"The ribs were good nice half rack. The cheesecake was the best i ever had in life. Whoever makes that cheesecake is the cheesecake god! It is so worth the price"}
{"text":"These Steaks are marinated with The Best Seasoning and grilled with Care. I absolutely Love the Wait Staff and large list of drinks! Plenty of delicious sides to choose from and couldn't wait to order dessert when our waitress suggestive sold us one! My friends and I always celebrate birthdays together throughout the year and enjoyed yet another one Here this year! Great Job!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our date night. The steak was cooked perfectly and our waitress was a delight."}
{"text":"I went to Michael T's with a large group. This was my first visit to this location under this name. I want to say Melanie and Mary did a great job of taking care of our group. They were quick to get our orders and our drinks. You rarely see that when you have a group of 20. The service definitely impressed me. We had some appetizers, and they were great. The cheese sticks were flavorful, breaded nicely, and gooey goodness. The Mac and cheese with shrimp and bacon was a taste bud surprise! Yum. The buffalo wings were dripping in sauce and had a nice flavor to them.

The main course was where a was let down. I ordered a Mushroom Jalapeño Swiss. I asked for it medium rare. When the burger came it was covered in onions. I don't like onions and there was no mention of them on the menu. The burger was also cooked well done. There was not a spot of pink in it. A burger is a pretty simple item to cook and this one wasn't even close. A couple of the other burgers at the table were over cooked as well. Many of the other entrees our group ordered looked great. The person next to me had a ribeye that looked and smelled great. 

I will likely go back with a smaller group to try them again. The pizzas look like another great option. Lots of things left to try!"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars but it won't allow me. Horrible services. Waited about 15mins to even order food. Given the place was not filled. It was practically empty. Once the server came by to take our order, it took another 30mins for him to come back and check on us. We asked when our food would be out, he apologized for the wait and said it shouldn't take too long. Another 30mins go by and he comes back without our food and tell us that it would be another 10mins. We decided not to wait any longer. We wanted somewhere to eat for my mother's birthday. Will never recommend this place to anyone. The \"manager\" was not very nice when we said we had been waiting so long. He told us it had only been 20mins since the food order was put. He than proceded to charge us for the drinks. We should not have had to pay for anything when they were the ones with bad service."}
{"text":"A group of 4 went for happy hour. The service to our table was uneven. At first the bartender came out to our table to serve, but only the first round. After that, even with a table full of empty glasses and two bartenders behind the bar with only about 10 patrons, we still had to flag down a food runner to get more drinks. Not clear on whether it's only bar service or table service.

The half price apps during HH are a good deal. We ordered several and all were tasty and good for the price...at full price they would be on the small side, however.

Be warned: the tall tables in the bar are very wobbly. I lost a good fourth of my draft to spillage when one of our party leaned an arm on the table."}
{"text":"There were definitely issues tonight with wait times but our server Jessica explained what was going on. It took a while to get our food but that isn't the servers fault. The beer was cold and the food hot when it got to us. We will definitely go back just for her as we always do. Tonight was definitely a one off night for the restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice.  From the outside it looks like a bar/small gaming place, but inside it is nice.  The restaurant is split into two different sections.  One the restaurant and the other is the bar which has smoking, but it is closed off by glass walls.  The server was very good and on his game.  The steak was good but the ceviche was really good."}
{"text":"Wow! MICHEAL Ts is definitely All the wonderful I've heard it to be! The food is absolutely amazing and reasonably priced. They have a tapas and appetizer menu that is half off during happy hr and that's 2-6 everyday. My favorite is the taco trio shrimp tacos and the ceviche. But everything is truly amazing.  
The atmosphere is very warm and service is on point. The dinning room features dueling pianos which can only add to ur already great experience on select nights. 
Now me personally I enjoy the bar area..where I can enjoy my cocktails..have a bite to eat and play a little keno. Machines have treated me right!$$$ 
I definitely have to give Michael T's five stars and highly recommend this place to everyone. You won't be disappointed to check this place out! Infact it will probably turn out to be your new favorite place... it certainly is mine"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and the staff are wonderful. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"There's literally not a better bar in this area. I love going to local bars rather than chains and they are so incredibly welcoming here. They appreciate regulars, but whether you're a regular or not, they treat you the same. I love that they keep all of the player's cards behind the bar, so if you forget it, or rather when you forget it (at least for me), it's no problem - just tell them you're last name and they'll find it. Bartenders like Julie and Alicia make you feel like family. I could name them all - they're all friendly and wear a smile on their face even when the rest of us might not. On the other hand, on those days when you just want to sit and play in silence, they have plenty to do, so they don't linger and talk your ear off when you're just not in the mood. Either you have it or you don't and this crew at Michael T's has it. I'll be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Eh. I've got to be honest this place isn't what I thought it was going to be with all the great reviews. We walked in here and we were one of two tables in the entire restaurant, and we still waited almost an hour for our food. For 2 pizzas. 

The lady that greeted us and got our waters was extremely unfriendly. I've noticed this a lot lately with customer service. It's kind of gone downhill everywhere I'm not sure why. Anyway, the man that served us was friendly, he told us he was new there which is totally fine and I don't think that this had anything to do with him but for some reason we were waiting forever to eat we were about to just cancel it and leave but we felt bad. 

Came here for a Super Bowl party before it was Michael Ts and this place was great. I don't think I'll try this place again."}
{"text":"Great service great food and gaming what more could you ask for this will most definitely our after work spot."}
{"text":"Don't have a bad thing to say bout this place. Been there more than once, exceptional food each time. 73 keys of ebony & ivory was awesome entertainment and even won a few bucks in the bar. Great people great food great night out. Thanks guys. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"New bar to check it out! We decided to come here to check out their happy hour menu. Half off on appetizers and tapas and also on beer and wine! This place is a local bar located on warm springs and tenaya. We've tried different appetizers and tapas and they all tasted great! I'm impressed with the food as most bar food I've tried before were just ok to me. My favorite out of all was the chimicurri with steak. That was delicious. 

They currently have s special for 2 that comes with 2 steaks, 1 bottle of wine, share salad, and dessert. I will definitely will give it a try next time I come back. 

I wish the cocktails are also happy hours though since I enjoy cocktails more.."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great customer service, and an awesome golf room. Definitely my favorite spot in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"the food is absolutely excellent, everything is made from scratch. the happy hour is amazing with endless choices of tapas and appetizers, not just your original corner bar. the service is excellent, and so are the people that work here. everyone is very welcoming. will def come back and spread the word for this amazing place."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. Nice feeling and lighting. Will be back to hear the pianos play. Tapas were better then expected. Ordered the wings, ceviche, steak chimicurri, dates, Mexican corn and sausages. Will be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful, attentive service.  Tried the $49 steak dinner for two (had a Groupon) including a bottle of wine, salad for two, two 8-oz steaks well prepared, loaded baked potato and grilled zucchini/squash/peppers.  Included some very good cheesecake to share."}
{"text":"This place was by far the best place I've ever gone to! 1st things 1st...if you can get a table in Mary's section you're already on the right track! Pineapple burger...DELICIOUS! Bacon wrapped dates....DELICIOUS! Ribs.........freaking AMAZING! DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON DESSERT!! Played it safe and got the peach cobbler...... TO. DIE. FOR. Customer service was impecable! This is just my opinion,  so I suggest you go try it! MARY IS DEFINITELY A1"}
{"text":"it's true... friendliest staff with great food! happy hour on weekends? they have it! greatest find on SW area! cheers! 101% recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent quality on the food ,ambience and service, The menu is very interesting, specially the appetizers and Tapas.
I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who wants to try something new in the neighborhood, kudos to the chef.
The corn and the cob , stuffed mushrooms and dates are incredible just writing this review I am craving them again!"}
{"text":"Michael T's offers peak hospitality.  At first glance upon entering it may appear to be another local bar (AHEM let me not mention the one which is what, every two miles and begins with a 'P') -- bur this spot has many creative approaches.  The lovely active bar area with gaming is on the right and is enclosed (smoking)! Gander inside though, chic out the mural on the wall of the three lovely gentlemen;)
The left side is a richly wood toned restaurant WITH dueling pianos!  Michael T's brings warmth and refinement to the neighborhood's area cookie cutter chain bars.
Yes, they have a fantastic selection of appetizers for happy hours.  That's right, plural TWO happy hours.  I'm suggesting all, the grilled artichoke and bacon wrapped dates are my favorites.  Clever twists on the Food, seasonal and fresh ingredients resonate throughout all items on the menu. 
Now, desserts...
The chef's creative whims on the creme brûlée cheesecake is something magical."}
{"text":"Wow. The food is amazing and so is the staff.  The girls behind the bar are amazing. They take good care of you and pour amazing drinks. 

The food is really really good.  I mean all of it. My wife ordered 6 things and we enjoyed them all. Full of flavor and top notch."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place is awesome!!!  Live music (#StefnRock)  in the bar during happy hour; amazing happy hour tapas (the artichoke was huge & cooked to perfection!).  We ordered rib platter (since it was 2 for 1) and took home leftovers!  Giant rack of meaty, fall off the bone with just the right amount of sauce served with fries (hot and delicious!) and slaw.   Tell Mary Ellen (the owner) we said hello and ask for our server (Mary H.) in the bar.     Oh yeah, don't forget the PEACH COBBLER A'LA MODE!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out o ver the weekend after work. Me and a co-worker came here dur8ng their grand opening. I liked the atmosphere as they had the sports bar area and restaurant are separated by a glass wall. We sat in the restaurant area and was seated very quickly and our server was very friendly. I tried the jambalaya per her recommendation and my friend tried the lamb chops. The jambalaya was outstanding and my friend enjoyed the lamb choos. After our meal the chef came out to our table and talked to us about our meals and asked what we liked about them and what could be better. I thought that was a good move as it shows that he's really concerned about his customers. I will definitely come back here again during lunch to try their lunch specials."}
{"text":"This is the best spot around in the area. The service was great, and the food was excellent. The music was very loud, and I couldn't hear my date talk."}
{"text":"Wow!  Food is awesome, great entertainment!  Can't wait for your Henderson location to open!!"}
{"text":"Alicia is an awesome bartender. Offered/made a great Jameson mule! Budget friendly hour hour with even better food options. Complements to the chef! All around wonderful experience. Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We usually go to Herbs and Rye for a half price steak during happy hour. The last couple of times have been very disappointing.  We v were in the southwest for a meeting and decided to try Michael T's. This was seriously the best steak we've had in a very long time.  Great service.  Nice atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I held my father's 90th birthday party here. It was the perfect choice! Made me look like a genius for finding the perfect venue, nothing but compliments from all 26 guests. Most notably, rave reviews about the steak and the salmon (the best ever.) Jose, the chef, truly makes magic in the kitchen. Ginger coordinated everything for me, and I just wish I'd gotten all the servers' names, not just Rachel's, so I could thank each one. Don't pass up the chance to get the stuffed mushroom appetizer, it's unbelievably good.
In addition, my husband and I have eaten here several times, and brought out-of-town visitors also. Not only great, but consistently great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, and plenty of options on the menu. The happy hour is a good deal make sure you show up with plenty of time to enjoy."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Happy hour has half priced tapas and apps. Been here a few times already tried something different on the menu each time and every time it's been fantastic"}
