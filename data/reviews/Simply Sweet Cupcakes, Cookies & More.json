{"text":"Cupcakes AND alcohol?!  Yes, please!!!
Simply Sweet is the BEST!  Their cake is delicious and super moist (I know a lot of people don't like that word but there's no better way to say it) and they create the perfect ratio of cake and frosting.
Great local business with great people who work there.  Will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to go here,even though I live with in walking distance, I still had to make time to stop.  The owner was very nice and really funny.   I did see what other reviewers meant about the toys, but I felt they were whimsical, but perhaps they have read the reviews here and have toned it down.  I bake myself,even though I specialize in cookies, I will make the occasional pie or cake.   I love to find a bakery that's better than me and I love to support local businesses when I can.  

That said, I got one chocolate cherry and one lemon cupcake.  I agree with another reviewer that the containers are really great and that they do indeed keep your cupcake stable, so big kudos to the owners for thinking ahead on that one!

The cherry cupcake was really moist, full of cherries and the ganache  was a happy blend of chocolate pudding and fudge.  It was so close to my award winning chocolate covered cherry bread  (2nd place in the 2010 Cuyahoga County Fair) that I was impressed. 

The lemon cake needs some work, however.  The cake itself was a little dry (could have been that individual cake) and again, I must agree with a fellow reviewer that the frosting needs some work.  While did not find ti overly sweet, I did find it crunchy, and frosting should not be crunchy, so they need to work on that.  The lemon curd that was hiding under the frosting appeared to homemade as it was NOT a lurid yellow color and more in line with the filling of a homemade lemon meringue pie, which is a VERY good thing.  

All in all this a very nice shop and they plan on adding tables as soon as the weathers warms.  I will return and see what else they offer and I will re-review if needed."}
{"text":"When it comes to cupcake shops, I'm like a pig hunting for truffles.  A big, frosting-coated pig, turning up the latest cupcake stores.  

...Which is, of course, the very image you want in  your head when envisioning cupcakes, I'm sure.  Which isn't quite fair to Simply Sweet Cupcakes, so let's shake that visual out of the ol' Etch-A-Sketch and move on.

That said, Simply Sweet Cupcakes is an odd storefront.  It looks more like a Beanie Baby outlet from the 1990s than a cupcake store, as stuffed animals are everywhere and the cupcakes are an afterthought - when you walk in, you actually don't see the cupcakes anywhere, and have to turn left to see them sitting on wooden shelves.  

And the cupcakes don't look particularly appetizing.  They are in very nice individual plastic containers, which shield the cupcakes nicely on the go, but they look mass-produced sitting in plastic buckets, with labels that show the ingredients.  I think the idea is that they're supposed to be professional, and it's nice to know what's in them... but it gives the impression that you're buying from some remote cupcake factory, not a local baker.  I kept thinking that I was buying them at Giant Eagle.  

Yet you don't eat environment, so how are the cupcakes? 

First off, these cupcakes are large, with an appealing weight to them.  They have *heft*, a pleasing density.  And the cake is surprisingly flavorful, a sort of rich chewiness saturated with the appropriate flavor.  If you're into cake, you crazy freak you, then you can get by with just the crumbly bits. 

The frosting, however, is a disappointment.  It's gritty with sugar, and though I have a sweet tooth it set my whole mouth jangling with a diabetic sweetness.  It's not inedible, but I can - and have! - eaten frosting straight out of the bowl, whereas with this I needed to pair it with that delicious cake to balance it out.  Even then, it wasn't a perfect balance.  

I want to like this place.  It screams \"local business\" from every pore, and I hope they do well.  But there's stiff competition for cupcakes in Cleveland, and I think they need to adjust their recipe - they ARE new - before they can be on the top tiers.  Unless they can attract people who just want the cake.  Which is delicious."}
{"text":"WANTED to like this place, I love supporting small local businesses. Parking was easy, behind the shop. I found the setup a bit odd, and the non-cupcake things on the walls made it feel a little bit garage-sale-like.

We stopped in mid-afternoon on a Saturday and the selection was limited by that time of day. We bought a 4-pack of the french toast cupcakes and I have to say were disappointed. The cupcakes were on the dry side and the frosting was just average. The bacon on top was amazing, but when isn't bacon amazing? Once was enough for us; the two remaining cupcakes are still sitting on my counter almost a day later."}
{"text":"Great customer service! So excited to find someone to help me delivery SAME day treats to my mom on her 75th birthday. The gentleman I spoke to on the phone is also making a special trip a bit outside of his delivery area - so thankful!"}
{"text":"So difficult to get ahold of! No answering machine and the phone just rings. I have been trying for weeks (literally. Because I was looking for cookies for an upcoming event. It's been about 2 months)"}
{"text":"I love dessert, especially cupcakes. I love to bake, but I also love to try other cupcakes. I've driven past Simply Sweet several times, but for one reason or another never got a chance to stop in. There's a good sized parking lot in the back, and the store front is connected to a coffee shop. As other reviews have noted, the containers keep the cup cakes stable so you don't end up with a cake that has fallen over (and then you're left licking frosting from a container. Yeah, I've done it). 

I'm not really sure what's up with all the other merchandise that's not edible. I feel like it's half flea market stand, half cupcakes and some dog treats. Now, about those dog treats - they definitely get a better review than the human treats. My dogs greatly enjoyed the treats and I will be back for those at some point. 

I do like that they offer mini cupcakes and \"regular\", which is a very generous size. I also think that they are very fairly priced. I also like that they have sampler packs already made up. It's a little annoying that you can't just walk in and select your own sample pack - you gotta go with what is in front of you. I stopped in with a friend, and we  tried a vanilla cupcake and a lemon raspberry. The lemon raspberry was just average, nothing worth trying again. The lemon was less tart, more overly sweet, borderline syrupy. The frosting was gritty and way too sweet. I like frosting, and even I thought that there was too much frosting (and again, just so sweet i worried I had a cavity after a few bites). 

We didn't finish that cupcake, and turned to the vanilla. It's vanilla. That's a classic, right? How bad could it be? I expected it to be basic, nothing exciting. I apparently set my hopes way too high. The cup cake was way too dense, like maybe they had mixed it a little too long or it was a day or two old. It definitely didn't taste fresh. Again, gritty and too sweet frosting. I think the frosting has to be regular sugar and butter. Maybe some vanilla. The cupcake was a little bland (well, minus the super sugary frosting). It wasn't overly vanilla, just... sweet and plain. Again, another cupcake left unfinished.

I had high hopes. Cupcakes don't often disappoint. Plus, it's a local place and the person working was very friendly and helpful. If I am nearby, I might stop in for dog treats, but no need to try the cupcakes or any desserts there again - there are much better places nearby."}
{"text":"Bright, clean, little shop, next door to the coffee shop. I went specifically for a tray of these mini cupcakes that they serve on the weekends made with alcohol. The chocolate ones had Jack Daniels, and the white ones I forget but they were actually my favorite of the two!"}
{"text":"I ordered two types of adult cupcakes for a weekend getaway with friends.  One was a Rum & Coke with a chocolate cake and the other was a white chocolate Southern Comfort.  We were all highly impressed!  (The only reason I gave them four stars was because I've had nothing but the adult cupcakes. I do need to try a regular cupcake someday soon.)  I am a huge fan of both white chocolate and Southern Comfort so to combine them both in one cupcake was like Heaven!  To guarantee you'll have your adult cupcakes for the weekend, be sure to order ahead.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how much everyone loved these cupcakes! They were a HUGE hit at a small get together that I had this weekend. The frosting was amazing and the cake was soft and flavorful. The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is that I could not get the cupcakes out of the container to plate them! They were so moist that my finger went right through! However, this will not stop me from buying them again!"}
{"text":"What a sweet deal.  C-l-o-y-i-n-g-l-y sweet. 

Know that your cupcake purchase helps enable kids with life-threatening illnesses fulfill their dreams of HUNTING!  Forget a new bike, a tech toy, a digital camera, or a day at Cedar Point.  Thanks to adults with mindsets that killing animals is fun---all you gun-toting Bubba's out there know who you are---innocent, impressionable kids believe it's something to look forward to, to dream about.  Nothing cuter than pint-sized camouflage jackets, bright orange caps, small rifles, and dead wildlife.

Making kids happy---especially those with serious health conditions or diseases---should make you feel good---not regretful.  Had I known the shop's position on this blood sport before buying four large cupcakes, I would have never set foot in it.  Like an unsuspecting rabbit, I was drawn in by the bait:  an alluring product and splashes of girly-girl pink on the store-front. I'm sure others were unwittingly ensnared, too.  After making my purchase I picked up their flyer but didn't read it until after sampling a bit of each from two cupcakes.  Having a conscience, this is a local I'll never support. 

Admittedly---because I'm honest---the moist and flavorful cake was nearly 4 stars.  But the frosting/icing---and there was plenty of it---was electrifyingly sweet, grainy- textured, dense, and probably nearly 100% sugar.  On mega-steroids.  There was no discernible cream, butter, or even margarine.  If you absolutely CRAVE sugar in its close to raw state---and don't care where your money is headed---here's your fix.

Hate that my once-in-a-lifetime purchase may procure even a single bullet, and can only hope that the one with my name on it misses its living, breathing, beautiful furry target and slams into a boulder."}
