{"text":"Nice rolls. After some mediocre experiences at other sushi places in the SW, this one really shines."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Calgary hands down. The food is amazing but the service is the best I have ever had in a restaurant. You are immediately greeted very cheerfully from the sushi chef.  I come here frequently and the lady remembers me every time. She always greets me and asks me how I am and she even remembers my name. I was really impressed. I will continue to go here for as long as I am in Calgary. 
Love this place, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very simple storefront and interior. Wasn't sure to to expect. Very good sushi. Lots to choose from. Fresh favors. Helpful waitstaff, both friendly and helped with making changes due to an allergy."}
{"text":"Yes, I finally made it to Sushi Motto

We were very kindly greeted and service was excellent. Like Chelsea said, a great amount of attention without being pestered. Ordering was easy and the food came so quickly, I couldn't believe it.

John is right about the spicy sauce, it is very different, but tasty. But if you're looking for that burn, you won't find it. We had the Flames roll which was great, (shrimp tempura, salmon, tuna, other things) and it was good but a bit too much of their roasted garlic. It tended to take away from the rest of the roll. 

I think I would have enjoyed their Yam Love roll a bit more if the yams were a bit more flavourful. But I have had bad luck with yams myself and know that sometimes they aren't as good as you want them to be. I did enjoy the generous amounts of avocado they included in all the rolls. (I could literally sit with a spoon and eat one) so this was definitely a plus for me.

Their prices are good, a little higher on some of the basic rolls (salmon, avocado) but you do get 8pc instead of the usual 6pc. Rolls are a bit messy, rice was quite uneven and loose, but it made it to my mouth in 1 piece and that's what's important, right? 



Overall: Delicious, great service, good prices, take me back!"}
{"text":"I can describe my first experience at Sushi Motto as pleasantly average. 
Service was good, we were greeted warmly and served quickly. The menu and pricing is pretty standard to other sushi restaurants in the area I found. 
The hilight for me was my seaweed salad. Interestingly, there is a small portion of the menu dedicated to Korean food. 
The only (tiny) negatives :                            1. The rice was a little too pasty. 
2. If you are driving, It can be difficult finding parking, especially on a weekend."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Motto quite a few times and it never seems to disappoint me. The sushi here is great, fresh, and the service is always great. With affordable prices, this is one of the best sushi places I've eaten at in Calgary. I always recommend this place to friends and coworkers for sushi and they love it!
My favourites are the crunch mango and crunch yam yam rolls... Delicious!"}
{"text":"Unmemorable. 

Sushi rice was cold which should of been the first warning. At least on a Tuesday night, the place was a ghost town. Now I agree that Tuesdays are not the most hopping nights (except for at Hi-Fi) but as a sushi restaurant, it is sort of required that you keep your rice fresh and ready to go. 

Ordered the usual suspects (seaweed salad, salmon sashimi, chop chop sushi) and a few new items (real crab California roll & red dragon roll). Nothing really stood out, everything was ok. Sashimi was reasonably fresh, decent size, rolls were well made but throughout the meal, I kept coming back to the cold rice, it really ruined the quality of the meal.

On the plus side, they do have tv and had the hockey game on. 

Maybe I will be back on a busier night to understand where all the positive reviews are coming from. 

16/30"}
{"text":"We go to this place often and I love this place. We have yet to try some of their korean dishes but they sure look good. So sad they don't make spider rolls any more - they were the BEST. I mean, the BEST! The server is super friendly and oh, the best miso soup in town."}
{"text":"To me, sushi is sushi. I haven't gotten around to trying a bunch, as I am limited to take-out/grab-n-go sushi experiences. So I have only really tried 2 kinds, a veggie roll and the classic california roll. By far my favorite is the cali (and if I can find it, the spicy cali rolls are to die for!) 

I had wanted to try Sushi Motto for about a month now. my boyfriend recently moved just south of 17th Ave and I have walked/driven past this place numerous times and wanted to try it. 

I went in on a Tuesday after work and was greeted right away. She knew instantly I wanted take-away and handed me a menu. I knew what I wanted (any guess on what i got hehe) and was out of there within 5 mins. 

When I got home, I was defiantly pleased. The sushi was just as I liked it. it came with a little cup of soy sauce instead of the packages which I did like better. less messy. 

I will defiantly be returning here, possibly for a sit down dinner next time."}
{"text":"The food was decent.  Small little place so go for lunch and not dinner.  Nothing really stand out.  We had a voucher and that's why we went otherwise, not exactly the place I would go in the first place.  Hard to find parking."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent visitor of this place for quite some time, but only as a take-out customer because my workplace is nearby.  I have finally dined-in a couple of times, so I thought why not write a review now.

I can tell you that I am never disappointed with the food from Sushi Motto and their customer service is always stellar.  Sushi rolls are always tasty and stick together and the fish is pretty fresh with their salmon being super yummy every time!  They have a couple creative rolls too, which are always fun to try.  The miso soup isn't too salty and service is always quick.  The prices are pretty average, which I also like.  

Sushi Motto is great for take-out and dine-in and they also have a patio, which I am frequenting for the summer.  I just love how friendly the service is here as well, it has actually brightened up my day a few times.  So, if you're in the area give it a try, sit on the patio if it's nice - great for people watching (if you're into that kind of thing, that is!)."}
{"text":"Newly opened, but just an average sushi restaurant. As you walk in, you see decor similar to that of a cheaper sushi bar.
The quality of the sushi was average and nothing that blows your socks off, but the rice was too mushy for my tastes. On the contrary, the fish was fresh, which was nice to see. I'd recommend the Unagi Don.
Since we used the $50 voucher for $100 worth of food, we splurged with the more expensive items on the menu. The 'original' rolls were about $10 - $15 each (see pictures), and the normal rolls were around $4 - $7, if I recall correctly. 
The service was pretty good, our waiter greeted us with friendly smiles and such, although she seemed a little rushed and managed to forget our orders of tea and our Tiger's Eye Roll. Maybe we were just unlucky as well, but it was awfully loud when we ate.
The food was okay, but for this price, I'd stick to a place with a nicer decor and atmosphere, with good sushi, ex Globefish.
I'd give this place a 3 1/2 star if I could.
Overall verdict! Pretty good: would consider again if out for sushi."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Thursday night, the sushi was sub-par at best. Ordered the octopus balls, which were delicious. The assorted sashimi platter tasted like it had just been thawed from the freezer, not a pleasant taste at all. The #94 was delicious, quite enjoyed it - also got the rainbow roll which was at best alright. Overall for the prices the portion sizes are small and the quality mediocre. May return to give their other non-sushi dishes a chance, but I won't be returning for sushi anytime soon"}
{"text":"I craved sushi (particulaly salmon nigiri) for the first time in my life about a week ago and Yelp lead me to Sushi Motto, only a 15 minute walk from my house.  I got take away, inspired by Wendy's review about a night on the couch.

I ordered salmon nigiri and tuna rolls.  The staff were incredibly friendly, the packaging very nice, and I enjoyed what I had.  I don't know how it would stack up for someone who really knows their sushi, but I can tell you that I had Globefish a few days later and although it was also very good I think I preferred Sushi Motto.

The actual restaurant looks pretty cool too -- casual but nice and peaceful."}
{"text":"Just moved near by and wanted to try it out. Based on the long list of awesome reviews on yelp, I had to at least try it. Glad I did, cause its really conveniently close and dam good."}
{"text":"I go to Sushi Motto so often, the server knows what I'm going to order before I even sit down. I'm not even ashamed of that.

So I hate rice. Can't stand the stuff. I know, weird. As a result, I really look for good sashimi if I'm headed out to a sushi spot. Motto definitely delivers on this front! The fish is fresh and delicious - even the tuna isn't overkill on the fishy-ness. The service is always great.

I've had takeout from Motto a few times as well. My only complaint is sometimes I fear that the server may be wondering if *all* this food could possibly be fore one person (it is), but she's always friendly!

Oh, and if you go on Saturdays there is a special on Sapporo. Now you know!"}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is a lot nicer and spacious than what it appears to be from the front.  I ordered a chop scallop roll and a tuna belly roll. The tuna roll was well made and full of flavourful diced tuna and green onions. The chop scallop also had more scallop than rice ratio  (nice big pieces), and instead of the usual cucumber, there was tidy amount of tobiko inside the roll. What I liked about the scallop roll was that there wasn't a lot of mayo nor was it watered down so that it was quite creamy. Tea was nice - nutty and strong - not that watered down stuff. A big pot for $1.00 is a great deal. I'll definitely be ordering more takeout from Sushi Motto. Restaurant was pretty busy for a Monday at noon."}
{"text":"So we've made a return trip back to Sushi Motto after our initial visit in January.  Their sushi is still decent, but we had given them a second chance on the tempura ice-cream.  This time we had their mango kind.  They have completely change their recipe for the tempera crust since our last visit.  It was hot and crunchy unlike last time!  We are glad that we gave them a second chance!"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. Clean, Friendly, Prompt, Good Food. Try their tea and miso soup on a cold day. Great combo. Then order something fun. Worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I've been walking by this place which is right by the office for a while and finally decided to pop in and grab some lunch. Super friendly service and excellent sushi! Their lunch boxes are reasonably priced, and huge - it's hard to have room to try one of their appetizers as well!

But if you do - try their Monkey Brains - a shell of fresh avocado filled with a seafood mixture, covered in panko and quickly fried. It's light and delicious - if a little hard to eat with chopsticks...

Since then I've been in at least weekly, and it's always been consistently excellent - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried them for lunch on Saturday 06 Aug 2011. Huge Bento box lunch specials, affordably priced (~$11), which my wife tried. I had the Bulgogi, our son had the short rib lunch special ($7). Miso soup included. In short, a Japanese place with some Korean menu items. Friendly service."}
{"text":"When you can back up the 20% grand opening special with great sushi even by itself, this is a winner.

plus not pretentious, casual. and good for hanging out, unlike Globefish, IMHO.  I do like Globe too but NS is better layout and open but I digress.

Ordered the plump pork dumplings, flavourful enough so didn't need that dip.

Tried their Special rolls, Volcano: spicy tuna, imitation crab, tobiko and a yummy sweet sesame dressing.   couldve been spicier for my needs but perhaps being picky.  Good bite-sized pieces, OK maybe 2 bites, made nicely.

look at their wasabi, smooth, made well instead of others where u see their thumb prints LOL.

bonus for white ginger, not that cheap pink stuff.

just opened last Tues so their 20 per cent off good til end Dec.

friendly service with tea pot service, no need to flag, eh?

they even have torched pressed salmon sushi, the rage in Vancouver a few years ago..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the pasty rice at Sushi Motto brought the whole meal down. The service was reasonable (ignoring the fact that the waitress was wearing flip flops. Nothing worse than looking at someone's toes while they serve me food!)  and the fish was really fresh and good - but the rice detracted. Presentation was lovely but taste just didn't live up to it. Barely touched the meal."}
{"text":"We get take out from here at least once a month. Normally get one of the combo trays. A combo tray, 4 soups, 2 orders of egg rolls and that will feed four adults and a toddler (yes, the toddler likes sushi).

Service for take out has always been good, 30 - 40 minutes from time to order to pick-up. Very friendly.

The food is delicious. I haven't had any rolls or food that I didn't enjoy. 

It may be a little pricey but we normally get out of there for about $15 per person. $20 each if we get extra appetizers and sushimi."}
{"text":"One Friday night I was craving Sushi. I had just moved to Calgary a few days prior so I had no idea where anything was or what in the city was good. So what do I do? I pull out my trusty Yelp app and search for Sushi. This was the closest place to my house so I set out down 17th to bring some sushi home.

After a 20 minute walk I arrived at Sushi Motto and was greeted pleasantly. I took a look at the take out menu and ordered two different types of rolls. Hindsight is 20/20, and I probably should have only ordered one set of rolls because two was way too much. They told me it would be about a 20 minute wait, but low and behold after about 7 minutes my order was ready. 

After paying I trudged back up the hill on 17th... it didn't seem this far on the way down, picked up two bottles of beer and headed home to enjoy my fantastic sushi! This place is great; I would definitely come here again. I thought it was clean, the staff were friendly and the sushi was reasonably priced! If you are in the area or want to go for a walk down 17th for sushi I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So far my experience at Sushi Motto is limited to take out, but to date I'm a fan!

I popped in last Tuesday to grab some grub before hunkering down for a date with my couch. Somehow sushi seemed like a healthier way to be a couch potato. It took me but a few moments with the menu to decide I was going to order #91, Assorted Sushi. This came with 6 pieces of tuna or salmon roll and 7 pieces of Nigiri. I went with the tuna.

All in all, my wait time amounted to about 10 minutes. Even before my food was ready, a server wandered over to the bench I was waiting on with a portable debit machine to see if I was ready to pay. 

When my order was ready, I received a chorus of \"thank you!\" and \"goodbye!\" from the sushi chefs and the server. They were so friendly!

Once I got it home, I opened my take out container to find my order carefully arranged inside. The sushi kept my eyes and 'buds entertained and my tummy full.

Places like Sushi Motto are fast making sushi one of my favourite filling, cheap eats kind of meals. Move over burger joints, there's a new favourite on Wendy's radar.

PS... Don't tell Banzai (my new fish) how much I'm enjoying sushi. We're just getting to know one another and I don't think this would make me look very good in his eyes!"}
{"text":"ushi Motto opened for business yesterday, Aug 21 2010.
I wander in and am immediately greeted by a familiar face- Ann, who used to be a server at Midori, owns the place. I was actually going to turn tail when I was informed that today was opening day (worst day to try a new resto, amirite?) but she was eager to seat me so I relented. Nice reno- new darker paint job, all new furniture, new lighting, looks nice, and Ann tells me that next summer that huge patio that was never used by Indonesia or Oishii Village will finally be opened. Anyway, the menu looks fairly typical, with a decent variety of apps, donburi, teriyaki, and sushi-- rolls, \"special\" rolls, hand rolls, nigiri, nothing earth shattering but comprehensive.
I got a spinach gomae salad, two pieces of maguro (\"tuna\" on the menu) nigiri, two unagi nigiri, one yam/avocado roll, one spicy tuna roll.
Spinach gomae is beautiful! The leaves are sort of arranged vertically, not in an oozy ball of mush as I've had at other places (eg Sushi Time in Toronto, now long gone), Dressing is sweet and thick sesame, turns out it's house-made. Very nice.
Sushi comes on one plate in a bit- and what a gorgeous plate it is! So pretty! I start with the tuna nigiri, and it's... it's superb. Nice thick (but not too thick), cleanly sliced tuna, not too cold (yay!), and almost-perfect rice (could have been a tiny but firmer a la Jo's at O Shima, but this piece of fish is bigger than O Shima too). Unagi up next- also superb. I am smiling. It's warm, a little crisp around the edges, perfect melting texture, perfect amount of sauce, an absolute treat.
Rolls are almost too pretty to eat but I press on with the veggie one. A nice big chunk of avocado is enrobed with more, but not too much, of that lovely rice and then topped with a double layer of crispy yam tempura- great composition, and the taste is heavenly. Finally the spicy tuna is almost solid tuna inside (thin strip of cuke, no filler) and on top is a dot of house-made (again, yay!) spicy sauce which has a slightly sweet note to but is like no other spicy sauce I've had- it's not mayo, not sriracha, not Korean pepper, it's unique and a little fruity. Loved it.
And I loved every morself I had at this place- I am amazed, just stunned, that they could pull off what ended up being one of the best sushi feeds I've ever had (and I've had sushi at four different places this week!), ON OPENING DAY."}
{"text":"Sushi Motto is literally a block from my house, and it was a Tuesday evening when my roomie and I had a fierce craving for sushi. Reading all of the solid reviews from you lovely Yelpers, and noticing John M.'s review stating that the owner was a previous employee of Midori, our other favourite in the area, I decided to give it a go!
We ordered a veggie combo, yam and avocado rolls, cucumber maki, and veggie tempura. This was plenty of food for two of us, except for they did miss one of our orders for yam/avo rolls (but perhaps I should have been more clear while ordering).
While looking at their menu, I noticed it was 20% off Tuesday, and brought in the coupon on my IPHONE to save paper. They laughed and thought I was ridiculous, but we received the discount anyways, so there. 
I will be back, Sushi Motto."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  It wasn't too busy, the server was nice, the food was great, and the prices were acceptable.  My favourite was the Crunch Mango roll, although the salmon and tuna sashimi were top-notch as well.  The Dynamite and Rainbow rolls were also extremely good (I hope those are their names--I know that the rolls we ordered were numbers 80, 90, and 100).

To get out of a sushi restaurant feeding 4 for under $90 was pretty incredible.  Add on the excellent food and great service, and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Average Japanese restaurant, I was here for lunch and I ordered 3 things:

Unagi Don
- fish is perfectly grilled and lightly coated with sauce, very tasty

Tuna Tataki
- tuna supposed to be light seared, however, I think it's slight over cooked and became very flakey, tuna flesh is fairly mushy too.. I can't taste the freshness

Spider Roll
- crab is deep fried and taste not bad, however, in other restaurant, spider roll came in at least 8 pieces, they only came in 6 piece.

Overall, service is very good, however, food portion is very small for the price paid, will try something else next time."}
