{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time the customer service is frequently less than stellar. On one occasion, our waitress just left- she finished her shift but didn't tell us or bring us a bill. We waited around until we had to go up to the bar. We didn't tip.   On another night, it was very busy, and our waitress was obviously stressed. She refused to split our bill up, telling us if a party had more than 8 people, it couldn't be split up- there were only 5 of us!  If you manage to go in when it's not busy, the service is okay. The food is pretty good, and they have decent specials. All in all, I would not go back here."}
{"text":"I went there with some friends we where given food menus after we got are drinks.  We asked if the kitchen was open they told us yes its open. So we proceed ask for food then we are told that the bar is closed so we said that we were leaving. This is when the wait staff fallow us to the door and assault us telling us to get out as we don't want to pay for the drinks that we did not touch. The bar tender then pushes us and hits us as we put up no resistance they fallow us out push us and hit us. This bar needs to be shut down."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but amazing things about this Gabby's which is why I was so disappointed when I stopped in for drinks tonight (June 12th around 10pm). We sat on the empty patio and waited for about 10 minutes before my boyfriend just went in to get us drink menus. Drinks took an unnaceptable amount of time (up to 25 minutes at one point) including a water that was asked for twice and never showed up. We would have stayed longer but we asked for the bill because service was so poor we didn't want to stay, we waited about 20 minutes before my boyfriend had to go in yet again, to ask for the bill, which was when the server admitted to forgetting we were even in the establishment completely because it was so busy. Another table sat beside us and they also were complaining about how unsatisfactory the service was, despite there only being 14 guests in the establishment."}
{"text":"Was frowned upon once we entered, server was not wanting to be here! Ordered wings ask to split the flavours was then grunted at. Received my platter with zero dipping sauces had to ask for them. Once we paid the server from the distance cheered that she had no tables to serve now had I seen that before leaving a tip I wouldn't have left one! Plus dirty as hell gross food establishment and service"}
{"text":"Love coming here. The food is okay depending on what you get. I love the California chicken sandwich with goat cheese (that's my personal add on) but i've had better wings. Just being honest. Service is fantastic especially if you come during the week during the day and get Brick as your bartender. She is FANTASTIC! I sometimes come in just because I know she's working. Love her!"}
{"text":"I came here last night with a Buytopia deal $18 for 2 NEW Premium Handcrafted Burgers, 2 Side Fries and 2 20oz. Pints of Domestic Beer. It is rather small and in the basement of the Isabella Hotel, but my experience was great. Our server was great and the burgers and pint were really good. I probably won't be back any time soon, but the deal was worth going for. I have been to a few other Gabby's locations and this one might not be as nice as the others, but it served me just fine."}
{"text":"Didn't I JUST write a poor review for the Gabby's on King Street? I guess I should know better... wishful thinking I suppose.  This location has a great patio that's usually fairly busy - makes for good atmosphere BUT the service was among the worst I've ever had. We went for a 'quick' lunch with coworkers and although I can't fault the server entirely (there seemed to be ONE person doing the patio lunchtime rush), we waited 25 minutes for a drink, and well over a hour for two clubs and one chicken caesar wrap.   ...and may I just say, it wasn't worth the wait. The club was terrible, and I thought this would be a safe bet after my horrendous steak frits experience. Too much bread, nothin' happening between the slices, and the dry chicken was dressed in a strange BBQ sauce. The fries were also soggy... although the best part of the meal.  I did enjoy my iced tea. Once I got it. Don't think I was offered a refill now that I think of it..."}
{"text":"This is an odd little Gabby's location in the basement of a hotel.   The patio out front looks pretty nice, but it was November, so that wasn't happening. The entrance is almost hidden, and you feel like you're going down into a dungeon. What I found most strange was that most of the tables were only for two people, so our group of three had to sit on one of those tall table with the \"high chairs\" that I never really find comfortable. It had a very grimy feel. There was even a bug in our salt shaker!  I had the wings, which were average at best. The beer selection was very average, so I had an Amsterdam Blonde.  This would get one star if not for the service, which was friendly and attentive. I certainly wouldn't go out of your way to visit this bar though."}
{"text":"Originally I was very upset that they had taken the Jalapeno Poppers off the menu. Apparently, and according to Dan the manager, they are putting them back on the menu; hence the 5 Stars. The service in this place is  second to none. Toni, who is not the manager but works as hard as one is the most amazing server I have ever dealt with, works a lot of the time so that is a bonus. The staff are always willing to help and even will go out of there way to help. I learned a few dance steps from Turner ( trying to perfect the robot!) and Bill is always good with a good clean joke. Ashley always wears a smile. The regular clientele is a good mix of the local population, some are a little quirky and you often have to put up with long boring stories about Art or painting,  but all in all it's  worth it. There is a regular named Andrew who is super funny and intelligent so it makes up for it!!  The 2 dollar taco special on Tuesday nights is great. Rumor has it that Saturday's will be cheap pint and country night. (finally I get to wear that cowboy hat I bought at Dollar Power!)  They have a dress code but it is very basic: you just have to be wearing some form of pants (shorts etc) as far as I know thongs are not acceptable and I have only been denied entrance once (my fault, just wearing a tee shirt and pair of shoes) Overall, fantastic experience, great food and great service. I will certainly visit again. Kevin's pretty cool"}
{"text":"** updated review:  the service is terrible. Sat on the patio last week for half an hour before we realized they weren't going to come out and take our order. Went inside to order and stood there for 10 minutes before we walked out and went somewhere else. Where the hell was the staff? There were just four old men drinking multiple drinks each at the bar. As though they had been stocked up before the waitress left.  A few weeks ago we came for dinner and asked if we would be able to sit on the patio- the waitress said 'I'm not going out there if it starts to rain'.. Which would be sorta understandable if it was calling for rain. She mentioned that so many times that we ended up sitting in the disgusting dirty basement instead.  I gotta say- the only thing worth the visit is the patio (and the wings, sometimes). This is unfortunate. However much we try to like this place the staff just seem to make it impossible.   Old Review: Previous rating 4 star.  Amazing wings- sometimes good service... Most of the time is it painfully slow- we were told on a beautiful night last week (after waiting for 30 minutes on the patio, went inside to order) that we could order food, but that we'd have to pick it up inside and bring it to our table outside. I guess the look of shock on our faces made the guy reconsider what he said and retracted that comment, offering to bring it out even though he was swamped.  By the two men sitting at the bar drinking alone.  The girls who work the patio are sweet though, they do their best and I like that :) I'll update this review once the season has really kicked off. For now, the wings are well worth the wait- thank goodness for half price Mondays!"}
{"text":"Came here because I was staying at the Isabella hotel, and this was downstairs so it was really convenient. Came around 10pm on Monday and it was really empty inside. I ordered the honey garlic traditional wings and they were so bad. It was probably the smallest chicken ever, so it had no meat on there. It was literally just skin! The sauce wasn't that good either. My boyfriend got the gabby burger and it was so mediocre. I could've made that at home, if not, better. The food took forever to come out even though we were the only table that ordered food. The servers would literally come take our order and go sit at the bar and go on her phone. Totally unprofessional. Overall this place was really disappointing."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my most recent visit to this little Gabby's location.   The goat cheese / pecan / steak salad I had was actually delicious and everything was very reasonably priced.   They have good drink specials all week as well. I think I've found my local watering hole. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The patio is the best reason to come here and for locals, the convenience. The food, like any other Gabby's is okay, but nothing really exciting. The vegetarian options could use some work.   I find during days in the summer, the staff is awesome, friendly and attentive. Late night, on a weekend though, the situation is much different. You will wait and wait, just for a drink order. And, if you go to the basement to order a drink at the bar, expect a 5 minute wait to pay while your serve chats up the Sherbourne Street locals."}
{"text":"meh I experienced pubs with better menu than what this one has. and of course I'm talking from vegetarian's viewpoint but we also have pub food craving sometime.  anyways. they have a vegan burger but it doesn't really have anything except few leafs of salad,  a slice of tomato, a piece of onion and a veg patty (that supposed to be amazing according to the menu description) and all that costs $9 or $10 with fries. which is acceptable but I want more stuff in my burget thank you.  lobed the patio in a very cute corner of a old looking hotel. but other than that... nothing special."}
{"text":"I gave this place for stars because for a pub it's a gem in its area. Sherbourne Wellesley has no place to sit outside and drink on a hot day. Isabella Hotel Gabby's has that spot. The burgers are pretty good the wings are great they do have limited seating but a fun booth for a big group. Prices are very reasonable and staff is super friendly a few regulars go there to have their drink after work. So fun place to take a first date"}
{"text":"This place is a basement styled watering hole meets pub vibe. If there is anything going for this place (and the reason I'm not giving it a 2 star) is because in the summer they have a pretty sweet patio, and enough draught beer selections to make this a justifiable summertime beer drinking locale which is far and few between in the Sherbourne neighbourhood.  One saving grace for non-summertime based enjoyment that I've recently discovered, is that on Mondays and Wednesdays they have half price wings. The wings aren't really standout or memorable by any means, but for $5 a pound it is a fair proposition."}
{"text":"This location is in the basement of Hotel Isabella.  They have a huge patio that is busy most nights of the week.  I usually go for breakfast on the weekends as they're basic breakfast is a great cure for a hangover.  Other than breakfast their food is sub par.  What keeps me coming back is their friendly staff who are always great.    Now I just need to try the Wednesday wing night..."}
{"text":"Great pub style food, and excellent service, hopefully you get Toni for your server, she is awesome, will be back again"}
