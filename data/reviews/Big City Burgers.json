{"text":"Excellent burgers and the rootbeer floats were fantastic.  The chicken sandwich was also good.  We will go back.  The service was great and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"We stopped in to give them a try, glad we did. Quite possibly the best burger I have ever had. Stop in and ruin yourself for other burgers."}
{"text":"I just treated my son to a Memphis burger and I had the Honolulu burger, both with sweet potato fries. Absolutely delicious and dripping with cheese. I like to support our local businesses and we'll be back. Check them out!"}
{"text":"The burgers are well seasoned and the toppings were awesome. Just killed the Clevelander and will never look back. That burger is a 10. 

Not only is the good great for the price, the wait staff was amazing with our kids. They even went as far as to get the kiddos crayons, animal place mats and kid size root beer floats. For this reason alone, we will be back."}
{"text":"Probably the worst burger I've ever eaten. Owner is a little delusional about his product. If you want a good burger, don't spend $9 here, go spend a buck at McDonald's, at least they're upfront about the quality of their meat. As far as burgers go, this place wants to be B-spot or 5 guys, but it's not even close, go home, buy a pound of good beef, and make your whole family a better burger than you'd get here for less money. A little tip, his burger might be good if he stopped trying to be master chef and just threw some meat on the grill. I likely won't go here again unless someone I know really wants to see how bad it really is."}
{"text":"Met with 2 clients here for first time for lunch. These burgers are absolutely the best burgers that I have tasted. They were not pre-made and packaged. Made from fresh meat. Definitely would recommend to all my friends and family. Thank you for the excellent meals"}
{"text":"Nice little place off Walker Rd and Miller in Avon Lake. I had the Chicago burger and fries. The burger was cooked perfectly. Order was to go and the gentleman in the kitchen asked if I wanted the burger separate from the bun so it would not be soggy by the time I got home.  Great recommendation and will keep that in mind next time.

Will be back soon..."}
{"text":"Very good burger on this visit. The Los Angeles delicate spinach mozzarella bacon avocado spread and garlic aioli. The aioli was fresh with minced garlic clearly visible. A very juicy burger as the puddle were my burger was place would indicate. Definitely worth a stop. My coworkers showed this place while I was in town they know I love good burgers and this is now on my stop everytime I'm near by list."}
{"text":"Tasty big burgers prepared in some interesting ways. Joey the owner cooks your burger himself! Nice people and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great burgers. In old Lenny's Deli location but huge improvement. Nice job on renovation and new name and menu. I will be back. Glad to see evening hours now too! Reasonable prices and great food."}
{"text":"Went to Big City Burgers for the first time this evening. The set up is the same as the former Lenny's that was there prior to the conversion to a burger shop. Menu is pretty simple, which I love. Nothing over complicated. It offerers a good variety of flavors and combinations for anyone's taste. I had the Clevelander burger with fries and it was delicious! The fries were your run of the mill fries but the burger was awesome! Fresh homemade and made to order. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to special order requests.  I'll definitely be back to try a few other items and their onion rings!   The down fall is they do no currently have alcohol but are working on it. That won't keep me away though!"}
{"text":"You have to try the Philly burger! My wife enjoyed the chicken breast sandwich as well.  We will be repeat customers for sure!"}
{"text":"I realize I'm breaking the mold here with a review of less than 4 stars, but here goes...

Dined here for the first time tonight. Upon entering we were greeted by a very friendly employee who doubled our very friendly server; she was the only employee we saw Ambience is sort of a  trying-to-look-like a diner vibe -- black-and-white laminate floors, a few booths, and a few tables. A TV was mounted on the wall with local 6 o'clock news turned up a bit too loud for our liking. (Hearing about missing and murdered children during dinner is just not our thing.)

We were seated, given menus and silverware... and almost immediately began swatting at a very persistent fly. Not a great first impression, although I realize the fly isn't their fault.

The menu is pretty straightforward: burgers, fries, onion rings, and salads, with a few daily specials (more burgers, two hot dog options) on the blackboard. The small menu contains several spelling errors, which my wife and I were trying to figure out were intentional or not. (Each burger is named after a city, with 3 of the options being Houstan, Los Angelos, and Phoeniex... are we missing a joke here?) They also misspell 'avacado' and 'pepper jackcheese.'

Oddly for a burger place, customers are not asked how they want their burgers to be cooked. They are prepared medium well unless you ask otherwise, and our server seemed a little surprised that I wanted otherwise. We ordered a Clevelander -- American cheese, bacon, a hard-cooked fried egg and Siracha aioli -- and the Los Angelos -- bacon, avacado (sic) spread [guacamole?], mozzarella, garlic aioli, and fresh spinach. My wife opted for sweet potato fries and I the onion rings, for an upcharge of $1.79 each.

Burgers were bland. The meat seemed of a pretty decent quality but it was just flavorless. My wife was disappointed that her fried egg was completely hard (not the usual at burger joints nowadays) and we both felt the burgers were excessively greasy and hard to eat with hands. The grease turned the bottom half of my bun to mush pretty quickly. There was an excessive amount of bacon on each, which might have been a treat had it not been fatty and very soggy.

Onion rings and sweet potato fries seemed of the frozen variety. If they weren't, they were nothing special at all. Tasty -- as most deep-fried things are -- but forgettable.

Through it all, our server was kind and attentive -- the best part of our experience actually.

For $35 -- 2 burgers with upcharge-sides, 2 Cokes, tax and tip -- there are just too many better burger places to patronize. A disappointment, since we love to support local joints... but dang if that wasn't a sweet and friendly server."}
{"text":"Big City Burgers stands out from the countless \"new burger joints\" that seem to be popping up all over the place. Our little ones had Hamburger Kids Meals and we shared the Clevelander & Memphis Burgers. The burgers were both phenomenal. The fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings were all seasoned and cooked perfectly. And most importantly, Joe and his staff were extremely helpful and very attentive before, during and after the meal. We'll definitely be back to this neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm the first reviewer to give less than five stars... Before the other reviewers track me down and beat to a pulp and make burgers out of me let me explain. 
I went there on a weekday about 45 minutes before they closed. My friend and I were the only people inside, other than the staff, which made the feel a little bit uncomfortable. I like to have people in restaurants, it feels more alive. Upon examining he menu I was really excited to try the burgers, all the different flavors sounded amazing. I have had many burgers in my young  life and I have high expectations so maybe that threw me off a bit. Also I'm used to being asked how I like it cooked. In prefer mine medium. Once I got my burger I realized why there's no option. The meat itself isn't a high enough quality in order for it to taste good and have good texture when cooked medium, which isn't a horrible thing. I've had low grade burgers that taste great; this one was good. Not great, but good. I think that if only they used a better meat and I had the option of getting it cooked medium then this place would definitely have five stars. The flavors are there, just not quite. Would I come again? Probably. Would info out of my way to come here? Unfortunately I probably still would. I'm a sucker for second chances and good burgers."}
{"text":"One of The Best Burgers I Have Ever Had

I ordered the Houstan and it was perfectly crafted with a juicy cut of pure beef. A tangy spicy ranch sauce that had a kick and did the burger right. Some sizzling bacon on top to add to the flavor and finally to top it off a crispy onion ring over cheddar cheese. Can't get much better than that. This place is the real deal and recommend it to anybody looking for a great burger at a great price."}
{"text":"Well I fulfilled my promise to try the place out.  Burger was great.  I got the Philly.  I will go back!  My kids liked it too."}
{"text":"Just stumbled across this place and am I glad I did! Best burger I've had in my 32 years of life! I will definitely be going back and telling all my friends about it. Visit them, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"If you want big burgers with big flavor then Big City is for you. This place used to be Lenny's Deli which I found late when their corned beef won me over. I wish I found it sooner but good things don't last forever!  Disappointed that Lenny's closed I had no intentions of trying Big City Burgers until I heard a few people buzzing around about it. So I decided to check it out and to my surprise it was under the same ownership but the menu was recreated and they reinvented themselves. I have visited Big City 3 times now and when I took my first bite of the Clevelander I was relieved that the loss of Lenny's was for good reason even though I believe the Corned Beef still deserves it's own spot on the menu. They could even call it the Old Town since it's from the old place and their menu titles revolve around \"Big City\" names. Anyways, onto the review...

I have tried 3 different burgers in my 3 visits. I had the Clevelander, the Chicago, and the St. Louis. All 3 were good but if I had to rank them I would have to go Clevelander, St. Louis, Chicago. Each one of my visits the staff has been very friendly and attentive. I'm not sure if the entire staff is related but nonetheless you still get that family vibe as if they all care and take pride in what they're doing. The food was excellent on my first 2 visits. Everything was cooked to perfection. My last visit today was still great but my burger was more in between a medium well and well done but somehow still seemed to have some of its juiciness. I believe somebody else cooked tonight because I didn't see the owner himself working the kitchen. He still did a great job though and maybe if I specified that I wanted a medium burger I would've got one but I think they usually ask and I wasn't thinking to request it at the time so I'm not going to take that away from the cook as it was still delicious and well prepared and presented. Their burgers are huge and their onion rings are amazing, especially if dipped into the Siracha Aioli so be sure to ask for a side of that to dip your onion rings in. I loved this place enough to return twice in a short period of time and will continue to go back and also to tell people about it. Hoping to see the former Lenny's Deli Corned Beef Sandwich from the old place on the menu next time I visit named after my suggestion, the \"Old Town\" because I still crave that thing!"}
{"text":"A great local burger joint that opened a few months ago where Lenny's Deli used to be! The same owners still run it and the food is just as tasty as it was then!  I do miss their amazing corned beef sammiches though! 

BCB has a nice selection of 10 different burgers on their regular menu named after different cities around the country, hence the name. (see pic) They also have the Big City Burger, which is just a plain burger with lettuce, onion, and tomato that you can customize with your choice of cheese and assorted toppings. The 12th burger is the Memphis, which has been on the specials board since they opened. Haha (see pic too) So far, I've had the St. Louis, the Clevelander, and the Chicago and I've honestly loved them all! Each is burger is cooked fresh to order on the flat top with a full 1/2 pound of juicy beef, melted cheese, fresh veggie toppings, and other assorted toppings and condiments piled high on a toasted brioche bun. Sofaking good!  Any burger patty can be substituted for a grilled chicken breast or organic black bean burger for no extra charge!  

Burgers come with fries and you can substitute sweet potato fries or onion rings for a small additional charge.  The fries are good, but don't appear to be fresh cut. The onion rings seemed to be homemade though. They were nice and crispy.  They also have three kinds of salad: House, Wedge, and Caesar.  It's a fairly simple menu and it works.

The dining room is clean and cozy with maybe 5 booths, a high top, and a few tables.  There's a small TV mounted on the wall for entertainment.

The workers at BCB are great! They've always been very friendly and they seem to genuinely enjoy working there.  The owner (I think his name is Joey) is really cool and laid back.  He does the majority of the cooking and he does a damn good job of it!

If you're in the mood for a big, hot, juicy burger, stop in and give Big City Burgers a try! You won't leave hungry!

This place is just around the corner from my house...that's dangerous! O_0!"}
