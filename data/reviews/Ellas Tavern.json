{"text":"If you are in the area you must try Ella's Tavern! Best prices on drinks in town and you will be pleasantly surprised on how good the food is. Perfect spot before a Cardinals, Coyote game."}
{"text":"Sadly this place has closed, I am not sure what happened. There was a sign on the door for weeks stating \"Opening late due to cleaning and inventory\" The sign on the door is gone and so is the business."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Great customer service and friendly environment. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was stoked to see Ella's open where Sammy's used to be, and my first impression was that it is much like Sammy's.  Same laid back atmosphere, very casual.  There's a pool table and juke box with fire pits in the back patio area.  I had an appetizer sampler and I was very happy.  Good bar food!  The drinks were fairly cheap as well and they always have specials.  The crowd was a good mix of people, both older and younger, and the servers were very friendly.  The only negative thing I can really say is that the service was slow, but that is to be expected for a new bar/restaurant that is ironing out the kinks.  I had a blast my first night there and I'm planning a return visit SOON!"}
{"text":"We went soon after it opened as Ella's. Like others here ,went when it was Sammy's and was glad to see it open under new management. I must  say the owner, I think Justin , was going around checking to see if everything was good. And it was very good. Didn't meet his wife who was said to be rude to customers and employees too. Sorry to hear that as we want to go back to enjoy this place again. Please remember that repeat business is your life's blood. I would hate to see this close down as so many before them. Check it out though. The food was great as was the bar drinks, and our server was super nice , friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great local place . Best wings and burgers!!!"}
{"text":"This is a dive that is cool enough to meet friends at, but it is never something I suggest. Drinks are reasonably priced, but really it's the age range of the patrons that kills it for me. I feel young here compared to everyone else. This definitely seem like a spot for the 35 and up crowd. The patio is cool though when it is nice out."}
{"text":"Went for Bears v cowgirl Monday night game walked in no game and was told cable was out... really and you call yourself a Chicago bar... sad..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place when Sammie Sr.  Was still young.  I've never had an issue with the staff. I've never seen them say anything rude or act rude.  You put garbage out, you get garbage back, so if you treated someone with disrespect, you'll get garbage back, don't bitch about it.   Glad this joint is back open, let's keep it this way!!!"}
