{"text":"Fantastic new (they've been around for a while but have been building their brewery, after a move from The Strip District) gluten free brewery. Founders are a couple wonderful families that are dedicated to total 'Gluten free zone' so those with celiac should feel very comfortable coming here!!

I have eaten gluten free for 5 years and used to love drinking beer on occasion. I was pleasantly surprised to hear of this place and rolled over for a taste. I fell in love with their Brown Ale. It tastes like beer! 

Most other GF beers I've had before is always so sweet to me.  So I've settled for wine, or dry hard cider as a substitute. Their mixture doesn't use whatever so many of those other brewers use and with them I've finally I've found a great tasting GF brew. My husband likes their white ale, and they have Nitro versions of both but I found at least the Brown Nitro is slightly sweeter than the Ale. 

Such nice folks! I can't say enough good things. They'll even give you a tour of the  facility and explain their processes....we've been back several times and can't wait for them to be open more days than Saturday and their brew to be bottled and show up all over town!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Emsworth and must admit that I did not think that it was the kind of town that would embrace a gluten free brewery. But I have to say I was very impressed by the quality of the beer first and foremost, and the staff. While some of the beers they make have that distinctive gluten-free flavor, most of their beer was just as good as anything you'll find at most craft breweries. The brown ale in particular stuck out to me as quite delicious and light but flavorful. The owners were readily available to answer any questions and showed a real passion for their work. If you are in the area and are looking for something new and different, give them a try."}
{"text":"Great place!   Friendly and helpful staff. Decent variety in their home grown gf beer selection.  Smallish main seating area but that adds to the charm.  Happy to have them in my neighborhood!  Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying there is absolutely no reason I need to drink gluten free beer. However, I'll continue drinking this beer for the sheer deliciousness of it!   After driving by this brewery on the regular I finally stopped in their tasting room the other day to do some sampling.  The blonde ale and  chocolate beer were terrific! I am a huge fan. The staff was friendly and all seemed to enjoy what they do."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a huge selection of Gluten free beer, and extra awesome...above and beyond employees - Auroch's Brewing is somewhere you MUST stop by!

I came here for my first Yelp elite event, I couldn't have had a better time! I do not have a condition which I MUST drink gluten free beer; but I can honestly say that I would recommend this place to anyone who loves any type of beer.. it's just delicious. 

I was able to pick up a 4 pack to go on the way out, and I must say.. the bottles are just as good as the draft beer that we were able to sample during our event. 

Check their website for hours, it seems they are becoming more of a grab and go type brewery."}
{"text":"What a fantastic spot! Doug, one of the founders, was great and really took the time to talk to us about their brewing process and veers. This is GREAT beer for gluten-free! I'm not gluten-sensitive, but we love to support local breweries so we gave them a try. The facility is awesome- everything inside is gluten-free, including all of the snacks they give you! The staff was all so friendly and personable. We have a wonderful experience, the beer was great, and we will definitely be back soon! They do growler fills and plan to start bottling soon!"}
{"text":"I don't drink beer, so this isn't a review of the beer. I bought a gift here and everyone was very friendly. They responded to my email inquiry quickly and were friendly in person, as well. I hear the beer is also very good if you like beer. :-)"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturday afternoons ago with my wife.  We had driven by Aurochs many times before and I had always wanted to stop.  However, their hours and my schedule never seemed to coincide until this past weekend.  The inside of Aurochs is divided into three separate areas, the taproom, a seating area and then a large back area where they not only make and keg the beer but which also has seating and board games.

Aurochs is different than most other breweries from the standpoint that they make all of their beer from quinoa and millet.  This gives it the advantage of being naturally gluten free.  On the day that I was there they had 5 beers on tap including a blonde, a wit, an amber and a brown on both regular and nitro.  I ended up making my own sampler consisting of one of each of the beers.  All of them tasted pretty good and I was not able to tell that a single one of them were gluten free.  Out of the bunch my favorite was the blonde which I picked up a growler of whenever we left.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back hear again in the future.  I enjoyed playing board games in the back area and thought all of their beers represented their types quite well."}
{"text":"Let me tell you I've tried ALL of the gluten free beers out there...and there's a reason why I just drink wine and cider, but this place has the best and I mean the absolute best gluten free beer I have ever had! 10\10 would recommend to both gluten free and non gluten free beer drinkers!"}
{"text":"Tasty gluten-free beer at the factory. There's a small bar out front and some additional tables and a t.v. back near the brewing tanks. No food but they've got some pretzels and pistachios set out on the tables. I had the nitro brown ale and my girlfriend had the blonde. Both were very good with a smoother taste than most craft beers. Owner and his helper were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"If you're on the hunt for a dedicated gluten free brewery, this is it! My boyfriend is gluten free so when we travel, he's always on the hunt for local GF beers. When he found out there was a GF brewery near Pittsburgh, it was a must-do on the itinerary. The brewery is outside the Pittsburgh area, in a suburb. Worth the drive if you're up for it. It took us about 20 minutes to get there from where we were staying.

The tasting room bar is right when you walk in, then there's a smaller room with a few tables, they even opened up a few tables in the brewery. The staff are all super friendly and helpful, willing to chat and asked us how we heard about the place and where we were from. They had lots of knowledge about the brewing process - their base is millet and quinoa for most of the beers, which allow it to be GF. They regularly test the levels too to ensure they're clear - a great option for beer lovers with celiac. 

I went for a flight, Dan got a couple pints. His favorite was the Session IPA, mine was the blonde ale. I also really liked the hefeweizen, which normally isn't my favorite, but I found it to be really well balanced (less banana than most, which I appreciate - very subtle). They also had a nitro brown ale that was really interesting, I liked the tasting of that! We ended up grabbing a growler to-go of the hefeweizen and the IPA.

Some of the beers could use a kick up on the carbonation. A few also have a sweeter profile to them, which often is the nature of a gluten free beer. Either way, having a solely gluten free brewery is so awesome and they're doing something great with this place. Can't wait to visit again and see the progress."}
{"text":"This is good beer.  Not, \"good for gluten free\", but good for any kind of beer.  The staff is so so friendly and very helpful.  My favorites are their blonde ale and their session IPA.  I am not GF, but I have friends who are, so it is wonderful that we can all share the same beer if we're hanging out.  It's definitely worth stopping in, or go online to their website and find out where you can purchase their bottles from."}
{"text":"This is beer! This is not imitation beer posing as real beer. It is delicious tasting beer. Need I say more? Okay, I will.

Being diagnosed with Celiac Disease is devastating. Legit, my first thought was... But what about beer??? There's a lot of great substitutes out there for bread, pasta and sweets... But beer would be the problem. Or so I thought! I had heard Aurochs name being floated around before my diagnosis, but once diagnosed, this shot up on my list. 

The staff is not only extremely friendly, but also very educated in beer and the gluten free lifestyle. I tasted pretty much all the beers on tap, and they were all solid choices. But my faves were the amber, which was super smooth and easy to drink and the brown ale. I love brown ales, but sometimes they're too heavy. This was actually lighter with a slight carbonation, which I really enjoyed. 

One thing I will note is that they've closed their tasting room for the time being. They want to focus on growing their distribution, which I am 100% supportive of. Everyone needs access to great gluten free beer! I can't be selfish. Well, I can in the fact that I'm happy they're located in Pittsburgh. So it's take out sales only, but it is well worth the drive! I promise, even if you are not observing a gluten free lifestyle, this is still good beer!"}
