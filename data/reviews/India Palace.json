{"text":"Having a craving for something spiced and exotic and motivated by a friend's comments that, \"there is a good Indian place over on Queen,\" I ventured out in hopes of finding something deliciously curried. Upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on Queen West where a string of three of four Indian restaurants are all lined up side-by-side, so which to choose?

One thing I love about Toronto restaurants that you won't always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building.  Little India stood out for it's well-organized, easy to understand and well-priced menu - in we went.

It is definitely an intimate spot, having no real capacity to hold very large groups, but was still quite comfortable for our dining duo. It was a cold Thursday night and not overly busy, so it did not feel crowded, and it gave the servers that much more time to be attentive.

The menu is substantial and has a variety of dishes. The price range is about $15 - $20 for an entrée, but be sure to ask which ones come with rice or Naan and which don't so that you can order them on the side.  First up was the mixed platter appetizer, which included samosas, onion bhajia, pakora and spring rolls. Everything was crispy, hot and just the right size for something before the entrée-and it came in at under $5.

For the main, I ordered the chicken kebab and my dinner partner had the Madras chicken.  Fair warning: if they tell you it's going to be hot, then it's truly hot.  We are all too accustomed to those Canadian-ized restaurants that tone down their spiciness to appease the masses, and it is arguable that Little India may do this too, but in any case, take the servers' recommendations to heart.  I do enjoy some heat, but my taste buds can't handle extremes, so I steered clear on this occasion-except for a little taste of the Madras.  For those of you who do like spice, you'll love this!  It has that heat that creeps up after a few bites, not that punch-in-the-face-burn that you might get from cheap chicken wings covered in Frank's Red Hot. Our server did lean my friend toward the less-spicy of the dishes she was deciding between at first, much to her dismay, but as it turns out his suggestion right on.  As for my tamer dish, it had more of a Mediterranean flavour to it; grilled, lemony and came with a cucumber salad garnished with cilantro.  It was a happy reminder of summer while dining in the depths of winter.

One of the greatest things about this restaurant is something I was not even able to take advantage of: the lunch buffet.  This is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace, but for those of you in the area, I say go for it!  Buffets have a bit of a bad reputation (and for the most part it's well-deserved), but a small arrangement at a non-chain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu, especially if it is food you're mostly unfamiliar with.

Overall, I can't leave you saying it was the very best Indian cuisine I've ever had, but I can say that I wasn't disappointed, and I would go back again-especially for that buffet."}
{"text":"Hidden gem not in the best part of town but it is worth the trip.  The buffet has over 12 different dishes to pick and choose from...all delicious.  Salads and sauces. Fresh bread served at your table, your choice of plain or garlic.  Two very good desserts...rice pudding or creamy mango custard.  Will definitely be back.  This resturant was referred to my Virginia friend, Yaseem by her brother who lives locally.  Thanks"}
{"text":"best food in vegas. our server anthony was awesome. great service and best indian food in LV"}
{"text":"So good! My husband and I hadn't had Indian in a long time, and the waiter there was so nice and helpful. He gave us great advice based on our preferences and what we'd be sharing. The food was marvelous, the service quick and friendly. Plus, we loved that they had a selection of Indian beers -- the perfect complement to the spiciness. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian Food my husband and I have found in the valley. The atmosphere is always calming and the service is top notch! They always make us feel welcome and are willing to provide us the best possible service! It's one of our hidden treasure restaurants tucked in a corner on Bell! If I didn't appreciate them I'd keep the hidden treasure a secret! Wether we done in or pickup we know we will never be disappointed! In case I didn't mention the flavorful menu...well it's to die for!"}

Friendly staff 

Can't go wrong here

{"text":"My friend and I are literally starving. And seeing their reviews we wanted to try them out. Because we are working on a work project we had placed an order for delivery. The call was made at 12:30 pm. Three hours later and 3 calls in talking to someone, who by the way I could not understand, they said each time that their driver was on the way. Well India Palace we will NOT be stopping in or ever call for a delivery for your food. Poor customer service and you lost money because of that!"}
{"text":"Never got a chance to taste the food..we order for home delivery..and nothing happened on it for an hour..after calling their shoddy phone gor like 10 min someone picked and told us that it is out for delivery..we were staying at flamingo and no food was here for another 30 min called again and someone came to deliver after 2 hrs..the delivery guy called us and asked us to come at flamingo enterance and when we said we cannon abd wantvthe food delivered ar our room..he was giving excuses..we have to pay $10 for drlivery and why should we walk down pick the food and come back eat it in our room then again come down..

{"text":"My favorite place in Las Vegas for Indian food. Love it, the food and the people... amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for my wife birthday last week and we decided to come to India Palace, and we did not make a wrong choice. Our waiter \"Gary\" was great, and the best part was the fresh delicious food without delay.

Definitely recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.

Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.

Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. A hidden gem. The Tikki Masala is the best we ever had. The Garlic Naan is to die for!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from LA and after 5 days of meals on the road, I was jonesing for a home cooked indian meal. We came across a Groupon deal and read excellent reviews for India Palace. When we got to the restaurant, it was not that busy and we got seated immediately, our server Anthony, seated us right away and was very attentive. My little one does not eat any spicy food, and the chef made my non spicy daal , which was delish! and was a hit with the little one. We ordered Chicken Tikka masala and kadhi goat. .both were excellent. The food HIT the SPOT. I am going to sleep sooooo well tonight. I would highly recommend this restaurant to Indians as well as others..."}
{"text":"Very good food. The best indian restaurant in the area. The food was Authentic, and even though the restaurant was very busy, our food came very quickly."}
{"text":"We went there on a weekday night by 10 PM. As the place closes by 10.30 PM, they refused to let us dine in but said that we can order take away. We ordered 2 plain naans, 2 garlic naans and chicken tikka masala. We waited for 30 mins but we were not given any update on our order. Only when we started to pester them about our order they hurried into the kitchen to get it ready. The taste of the food was good. The parking lot was a bit cramped. IT would have been full if we had come by 9 PM. 

Service was the main negative of this place. They were not hospitable to us. Too business oriented and in your face attitude."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is excellent. I especially like the lunch buffet so I can try new things. My favorite is the Chicken Vindaloo - DELICIOUS. Great take out too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Kashmiri naan, Chicken Korma, Chicken Masala are my favorites. The service is always fast. Not enthusiastically friendly but far from rude.  They put much effort into a nice decor. You will not be disapppointed."}
{"text":"the food here is amazing.. we go here a lot and cant stress enough that how much we love this food..Ask for Garry...he is an amazing person and his customer service is great...everytime we go there Garry takes care of us really good..the food is always exactly the way we want and we get everything even before asking..garry is great..."}
{"text":"Goat curry here is awesome... it is well cooked.. ans not at all chewy. it is difficult to find well cooked goat at indian restaurant.  Manny was very graceful."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place by accident.  And what a treat!  The food was exceptional.  The best Indian food I've had in Phoenix in the 18 years that I have lived here!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at the best Indian restaurants in major cities like NYC and San Fran, and this place is a hidden gem in Phoenix.  The food is amazing, authentic-reasonably priced given the high quality ingredients they use.  The women that run the place treat you like family and are simply delightful.  It's non-descript location in a strip mall could be easily overlooked but definitely should not."}
{"text":"My experience here was awesome the interior is beautiful & neat with some songs playing in the background  I and my husband loved the food our dishes were made exactly as we wanted to top it all Our server was Anthony & was a plus point to our experience he gave us suggestions on different dishes and also saw that we were completely satisfied. I shall  surely suggest it to everyone thumbs up guys."}
{"text":"Umm.. YUMM! The Tikki masala is perfect. We got the garlic naan and it was fluffy and delicious! We also got the chicken korma and they use dark meat chicken, which is so tender and delicious! Check in for the mango lassi. It's out of this world good!! Manny our waiter was awesome!! He was Super attentive and took time to give great recommendations. Oh, and he has a great bod, so a very nice view;) They have Indian music videos playing on 3 big screen TV's which is super fun and immerses you in the culture. I Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, outstanding service.  Have been here 5 times in the past year, and every time has been great.  Ordered off the menu 2 times and had the lunch buffet 3 times.  Could not ask for a better spread, have everything seasoned diners enjoy, and enough to get a new eater hooked.  Butter chicken is succulent, lamb/goat is served daily, and the vegetarian is catered to as well.  Desserts are wonderful and masala tea is great for after dinner."}
{"text":"Best Indian food 
Delicious food, more quantity, less price and full of flavors 
Totally recommend..!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my spouse and brought her using a Groupon. It was worth 35 dollars but they'd only validated if We spent at least 24 dollars more.  We decided to leave."}
{"text":"My friend and I called ahead to see if they had a lunch buffet on Sunday. The person who answered the phone was prompt and courteous. He confirmed that they had a Sunday buffet for $11.99. I asked if there were any vegetarian dishes. He said yes, and then rattled off a half a dozen of them off the top of his head. Great!  We're on our way.

This place is located just off of the strip -- don't walk it though. It seems to cater to locals and adventurous tourists and California visitors looking for good Indian food (like me). The area is a little run down, definitely not the pride of Vegas. Buffets are common in this town, even in off-strip restaurants, where even all-you-can-eat sushi is the norm. 

India Palace has been completely remodeled inside and out since I was last there a few years ago. I think that even the assphalt parking lot was new.  The new space is awesome inside. It's very nice and well appointed.  Trendy, somewhat techno Indian music adds to a well-designed layout with dark wood tables, cozy booths, and a nice central bar area.

The lunch buffet was great! Lots of veggie stuff to choose from. Little to no vegan though -- hard to find with Indian food since ghee and cream are staples.

They also must be paying attention to some Yelpers since the service was great.   The service was fast and friendly and hot naan hit our table about as fast as it takes to cook it.  And, yes, you can get the matriarch to smile when you smile at her and compliment her naan (which *was* fantastic!)

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Indian Food is my favorite and India Palace is the place to go! The waiter Vic was so helpful and sweet"}
{"text":"Amazing service (by Manny and a really cool and cheerful grandma who helps serve food)! Awesome food - BEST MALAI KOFTA EVERR!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food! I love the chicken korma and the basil naan a bunch! Whenever I am in Las Vegas, I try and make it to India Palace. It's off the Strip but not too far away but would require a short cab ride, but in my opinion, it's better than any of the places on the Strip for Indian food. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Everything we ordered was great! Gary is the friendliest and most helpful waiter. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for some good indian food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious food. One of my favorite places to eat when in Vegas. Great service. They really took care of us for my husband's Bday!"}
{"text":"We were there for dinner a couple of days ago with family..and the food and service was really good..our host/ server Vick looked after us really well..he was very hospitable and made us feel at home...surely would go back whenever in Vegas.."}
{"text":"The only Indian food in vegas worth eating.  I have been living here for twelve years and I have tried them all and seen many come and go.  IP is simply the best in quality of ingredients and taste,  the neighborhood is a little shady....but I guess you can't have it all.....enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! We live in South Scottsdale and drove through five'o clock traffic to try this place and it was well worth it. If you enjoy great Indian food give this is a must in the Phoenix area. They have a lunch buffet but we ordered off the dinner menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Groupon, and after reviewing the menu I was really excited to try this place. At first, everything was really nice. When we were being seated, the host told us a party of 50 was coming in, and that the back room might be quieter, which it was. The back room has 4 tables and is a nice intimate setting. Note, that in the time we were there, one tour bus full of tourists came in, ate, left, and another bus full was coming in as we were leaving. The bus loads of people appeared constant, and if we had sat in the main dining room, it might have been miserable. 

But anyway. Everything we ate tasted really good. We ordered a goat dish, a lamb dish, and samosas. The veggie samosas were kind of bland, and only had potato in them, but tasted fine. When we ordered it was a little weird that the waiter asked us what kind of rice and naan we wanted, as if it came with our meal, when in fact it didn't. I've never been to an indian restaurant that charged extra for rice, so I thought that was a little shady. 

But really none of that mattered, because towards the end of our meal, we found a hair in our food. A short, curly, kind of hair. We showed the manager. His response was \"do you want some more rice? I can get you some free rice to go? I'll take 10% off of your bill, mistakes happen, it probably came from the buffet.\" Um, number one, we didn't eat from the buffet, and number two, DUDE there is a pubic hair in our food. While I appreciate him taking a little bit off of the bill, what I would really prefer is for him to look disgusted, and go back to his kitchen and have a very serious talk with his cooks about hygiene and cleanliness. But I had the distinct impression that wasn't going to happen, and he just sort of acted like, oh these things happen sometimes. Maybe he didn't understand that this hair did not fall off of someone's head?

So, even though the food tasted good, and up until that point we had been having a nice time, I really don't think I can get past a pubic hair in my food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but unfortunately India Palace has slowly gone down hill. Waaaay down hill. Plus as I  learned, they have zero loyalty to their customers who eat there fairly regularly. Last night was the last straw. In fact my meal was like chewing straw and inedible. I ordered the Bhindi Masala which is a vegetable okra dish. I have had this several times before but tonight the okra was so tough that if I were to actually swallow it (rather than spit it out in my napkin-sorry gross but true) I guarantee my throat would have been scratched. Also our Roti bread was burned.Not once did anyone check to see how our meals were. When the waitress offered me a box for the uneaten meal at the end , I declined and explained the situation: I have had this dish before but it was like chewing wood shavings (explained it nicer than that) and she just said ok and brought us the bill with no offer to either replace it with another item or take it off the bill like 99.9% of establishments would do. So, they have lost our business and managed  to tick off a yelper over a VERY simple customer service issue."}
{"text":"Called to see if they deliver. After a lot of chitter chatter in the background I'm asked what I want and when I ask if they deliver to a casino on the strip I'm told the order should be a min of $45 and the delivery charges are an additional $10!
Am I comfortable with that - NO, thank you!"}
{"text":"This is like any other Indian restaurants when it comes to weekday lunch buffet. Not out of the ordinary and at the same time the food is not too bad."}
{"text":"Food is good but the management & service isn't the best. If you want friendly staff this isn't the spot. Scary neighborhood too."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Stopped here before heading back to Los Angeles. We got the lamb pasanda and shrimp masala and a naan stuffed with cheese and herbs, I extremely recommend it. Vick is a nice man, he hooked us up with 2 mango lassis."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in town! I would recommend the vegetable korma with garlic knots! With my husband we come here once a week! The service is great and the ambiance perfect! I just love this place!"}
{"text":"Insipid food. So so service. Cleanliness level is highly questionable."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was satisfied with my meal.  At 8:30 PM I was the only one in the restaurant so that was pretty odd. I got some lamb vindaloo, garlic naan and a lager. The lamb was good but a little on the tough side and the vindaloo was nice and spicy as I wanted. rice wasn't included in the dish which was somewhat of a letdown considering the vindaloo itself was not on the bargain side of pricing. But overall the waitstaff was good  and the food was satisfying. Would definitely eat here again if in the area and needed a hit of Indian."}
{"text":"Out of all the Indian restaurants I've tried in Vegas, this is the best so far. And I'm pretty picky seeing as I grew up in an Indian household with awesome homecooked Indian food almost everyday. The buffet lunches are your best bet...because you can try everything for hella cheap! My favorite is the chicken tikki masala, saag paneer, and of course, their naan. If you're into yogurt drinks, try the Sweet Lassi. Yummilicious"}
{"text":"Generous Host, limited but tasty veg options. Liked the paranthas along with Dal. Don't try South Indian Dosa or Idli. Stick to North Indian cuisine"}
{"text":"We visited on a random reco in January and were a bit sketchy because of the neighborhood (you have to call a cab for pickup) but we live in LA where usually the best restaurants are in a weird strip mall. 

The wait staff was terrific in recommending a bunch of options. We are vegetarians so we just asked what the house specialties were and had a fantastic set of 3 different dishes. We did hear another couple raving about some of the meat options so I bet those are stellar as well. Prices were very reasonable and it was only a $15 cab ride from City Center.

The staff was very friendly and we're going back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food are fresh and well made here!  The place was very clean too!  We are regular customers."}
{"text":"It was a great time being at India Palace. I love the food and service both. Particular, Gary is the guy who provide us excellent service whenever I been here with my friends. He always recommend us few things and we enjoy 'em all. Thank you very much Gary, we truly like your service. I strongly recommend to visit this place if you fond of Indian food."}
{"text":"India Palace is our favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. The vegetable pakoras and samosas are delicious and they make the BEST malai kofta we have ever had. Every dish that we have eaten there (and we have eaten there a lot!) has been delicious so it makes it hard to choose just one dish! And don't forget the garlic naan - amazing!"}
{"text":"I am from the Northern California area (San Jose) and I am well aware of the buffet system with Indian restaurants, not to mention but I know folks who have worked in Indian restaurants. I can understand food being re-heated for a day or so in buffets. But this was horrible... they don't serve you fresh food, they serve you food who knows how many days old, my guess would be 4 days.... and the taste was below average, sure not a 4 star place.

All of us in our group could feel that the food was old. Its a no brainer 1 star when I don't get fresh food for the money I pay. I should say the food was so horrible, that I repented as to why I bought the Yelp deal.

And to top it off, Mothers day the buffet was $15 instead of the regular $12. ha haa... what a deal? I have heard restaurants giving discounts, now what do you call this - \"Looting your money for stale food\".. ??

There are better places around that I have been to, try them - Tamba, Mint. The taste was ok, but most importantly I ate healthy food."}
{"text":"I love their food especially chicken karahi n garlic naan it's awesome made fresh to order I also recommend their mango lassi. the Restuarant is clean and beautifully decorated.  Me n my husband always end up here on our day off thanks Anthony Mike for your friendly service."}
{"text":"This place deserves the high ratings on Yelp. Tried this place because of Groupon and so glad we did.  Their condiments for the papadam were a bit too spicy for my kid. We like that we could customize the spiciness of our dishes from 1-10, we chose a 3 and it was on the spicier side of 3 but all delicious.  The Chicken tikka masala which is usually our favorite dish was very very good, well spiced and great over the rice.  The rice was very fluffy and did not clump.  The garlic naan was fantastic!  The Bindhi (okra) masala was very good as well. Great wait staff and a good experience."}
{"text":"Great food and great hospitality! Will definitely go back. I tried the buffet once and their a la carte menu another time and they were both very good."}
{"text":"I grew up in Phoenix, and my family has been coming to India Palace for years. I love this place--GREAT food and friendly, attentive service. I now live in San Diego, and I haven't found an Indian restaurant that compares. Every time that I visit the Phoenix area, I have to eat here--it's a must! 

First of all, India Palace has lunch buffets on the weekends and throughout the week. At other Indian restaurants, buffets can be hit or miss, but the food is always spot on at India Palace--great selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, tandoori chicken, complimentary hot tea, naan (flat bread) and dessert! I especially love the mushroom curry and the minced lamb. Everything is fresh and spiced to perfection! It's also an excellent value. 

The service has always been great at India Palace. This is a family owned restaurant, and they make you feel like family. You will never want for warm naan (plain or with garlic seasoning), fresh from the oven. 

I can't say enough good things about this place. It's certainly a 'hole-in-the-wall' by Phoenix standards, as the strip mall where it's located can be a bit off-putting, but pay no attention! Park your car and follow the scent of curry!! Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"1 star is only for the Chef. Food was really good. However, for Staff I will give 0 stars. We dealt with 4 of them and all of them were very rude. They try to crack jokes which are very insensitive to the customers. I will not recommend this. It doesn't matter how much you want to order, they'll bring you whatever they think it's right for your party."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a week & have always been welcomed by a great staff serving the best Indian food in town. Highly recommended by my whole family ranging from food allergies to extremely picky eaters, everyone always leaves here happy!"}
{"text":"Friendly service with attentive zervice, but not pushy...FABULOUS FOOD, always fresh...if you dont see it on the menu, just ask...they will usually whip it up for you! Special requests for an item already on the menu? That isn't a problem either. Delicious, courteous, fresh, fast, filling...one of the best East Indian restaurants that we have had the pleasure of dining at on the west side of the valley....was not our first visit, and won't be the last time for us eaither! Vegetarian, vegan, beef, fish, poultry, lamb...rice, sauces...very good stuff! You would be missing out not to try!"}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants in the valley and this one is the greatest by far!  The service is great and the food is wonderful.  When we want to try different dishes they are very accomodating and give us a sample to try to see if we will like it first.  I highly recommed it!"}
{"text":"Worst buffet worst service . The gulab Jamun can be used for scientific experiments, I think it has been frozen for like 10 years. Bread was dry, rice half cooked and curries were just some frozen cut vegetables in a pool of Garam masala . Stay away from this place unless u want to cleanse your bowel with dysentery and food poisoning."}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet. After reading reviews we thought this was our place.  After eating there I suggest you try some of the other places of try a different food.  Our party of 4 all experienced Indian food eaters had stomach issues. I also had the MSG dry mouth and head ache I get from Asian buffets.  

The selection on the buffet was smaller than the place I eat at in Arkansas.  And the spices were bland. Not what I have come to expect from Indian offerings.  The service was good and the restaurant was clean.   

My friends that live here said they would not be back.  Overall a big disappointment."}
{"text":"If it were in my hands I would give this place negative ratings. I am an Indian and I have been to all sort of Indian restaurants in US and in India.

So let me start my part of experience here. Me and my friends went here reading all the nice yelp reviews. We ordered some appetizers, some sabji, naan and MYSORE MASALA DOSA.

The waiter took our order and asked us if we want the sabji spicy or medium spicy. We said medium spicy would be good. So he brings everything from starter to the sabji and naan in order. The starters were okay and sabji was totally bland. We could easily say, since I have some cooking experience, that the mixed vegetable sabji was made out of frozen ready made cut vegetables, partially cooked and lacking all the spices that make it Indian. But we did not complain because we thought that it might be because we said medium spicy.

So, after we all but my poor friend who had ordered the DOSA, were done with our lunch, they bring the DOSA. The sambhar is sour like lemonade (we did not complain about it), but the MYSORE DOSA is full of red chilli powder. She, could barely eat two pieces of it. So, we call the waiter and tell him that we find it too spicy. He starts explaining us that we don't know what an actual MYSORE MASALA tastes like. And tells us that since we have not eaten an actual MYSORE MASALA in the city of MYSORE in INDIA we should not complain about it. So,  I informed him that I am from India and I have eaten MYSORE MASALA for more than 25 years and yes in MYSORE too and its never this spicy. He made faces and so I told him that its their mistake because they should have mentioned that it is very spicy in their menu. So, he got a bit scared and offered us some complimentary dessert, which we obviously denied and left the place paying for everything, with bad taste in our mouth."}
{"text":"No freebies or know the owner. We were on vacation and was looking for a decent Indian food so yelped and saw good reviews for this place. Also they had specials of free mango lassi. So we decided to try it out.

Was a good decision. Went there and placed a order, when the server came to take our order I told him that I had checked in on yelp for free mango lassi. The server was unaware of it ( seems like he had just joined) so he went to the manager to ask. The manger was extremely nice so he he came to us personally and told that we will get free lassi and that he was sorry that the server was unaware of it.
 
The only thing they could change is maybe increase the potion sizes a little bit, other wise the food tasted very good.

Also the ambience was nice to............overall good place"}
{"text":"Good Indian food nice interior and good service by Anthony I'll visit here again and I strongly  recommend this to everyone"}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala, and well, everything else here tastes amazing! However, I am severely allergic to cashews, and I told our server this. He said they could make the masala for me without cashews...but they forgot or something. So I had a pretty bad allergic reaction at the table that left me sick for two days. I haven't been back since because I'm scared, but if you like curry, and aren't allergic to cashews, you should definitely check this place out. The first two bites of that tikka masala were (almost) to die for!"}
{"text":"Good service, good atmosphere, average $12 per entree.
Having returned from a 3wk trip in northern India about a month ago, I was disappointed with the food.
* Mattar Paneer was alright - the peas seemed to be the frozen kind, very sweet.
* Chicken curry was too salty
* Goat Rogan Josh was good
* Rice and Garlic Naan were good.

My Indian coworker recommended Mint - I guess I'll try that one next."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant thanks to Groupon. We love Indian Food, and were excited to try a new place (to us). I, especially, have been disappointed in the past by other local Indian places. This was wonderful, so glad we did it!

We weren't thrilled about the neighborhood as we drove in, but we've been pleasantly surprised by other great restaurants nearby. The exterior of the building is a nice modern look, and the smell coming over us in the parking lot - just amazing. The interior is beautiful, and the TV's playing Bollywood were kitschy, but fun.

Our waiter was fabulous. Attentive, helpful, and great suggestions, but never overbearing. We ordered the appetizer sampler. Tasty samosas, great fried cheese, and the Bombay fish just blew us out of the water. Light breading, great seasoning on the fish, and just overall fantastic.

For entrees we got the Dal Lamb and the Lamb Rogan Josh. Both were phenomenal. The Dal Lamb is reminiscent of a chili dish with the lentils and kind of dark spices. The Rogan Josh was perfectly creamy and spiced. We ordered both mild, not knowing what kind of scale of heat the kitchen was on. These were REALLY mild. We definitely should have gone at least medium. Next time for sure! For sides we had the garlic naan and the peas pulao rice. The rice has so much in it, and was just wonderful, and the garlic naan was perfectly toasted. Both were great compliments to the entrees, and were suggested by the waiter. He had great taste!

We didn't have a dessert - we were so stuffed! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Travel for work and this was the best Indian food I've ever had. In fact I signed up to leave this review. Manny was a wonderful host and I will venture off the strip every time I come to town to enjoy some India Palace."}
{"text":"First time here and I love it!!! the service was good and friendly. The food was delicious. I recommend the chicken curry with bone and the goat curry. ask for Anthony for a great service. plus they have fresh naan!!! yummy. whenever in las vegas and you like Indian food this is the palace to go."}
{"text":"I ordered food from them on-line and was shocked to find that the chicken tikka masala did NOT include rice and was $14.95!!!! Absolutely outrageous."}
{"text":"We went for the buffet on Saturday. Good flavors, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Now this place has an awesome buffet. I was totally disappointed with Las Vegas Indian resturants and then made it to this one on the last day of our trip. Can't say enough about this place. The food was delicious, fresh, with enough variety and each dish was a pleasure to taste. The decor was nice and Indian and even the restrooms were clean. Very satisfied, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of Indian food, but the Chicken Tikka Masala here made me a believer.  It's so creamy and buttery, and is perfect when paired with their delectable garlic naan.  We also enjoy their fried vegetable samosas.  Great place to go for dinner, especially because it's never crowded.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amaze balls, I got the Chana masks and I am stuffed. I do not agree with having a separate charge for rice."}
{"text":"Took the family to this restaurant based on the high reviews from trip advisor. We ordered chicken tikka masala (mild), chicken vindaloo (med), and an order of both plain and garlic naan. The tikka masala was flavorful and what you would expect.  The vindaloo, which is the dish I order 95% of the time at Indian restaurants, was good but slightly bland. The naan bread was good but not necessarily something to write home about. So far it would appear that this review should be average versus poor.  The items that brought this restaurant down a level were an incorrect menu item, their service, and their spice levels. 

I enjoy spicy food and often order my meal hot/spicy however because I had my 15 month old and my six-year-old boys with me I ordered the vindaloo medium and the masala mild. Neither of my boys were able to eat the masala due to spice, and I almost could not eat the vindaloo. WAY too spicy for what was ordered. 

Secondly, I ordered the \"Bass Ale (22oz)\" from the menu; however, a 12oz bottle arrived, the menu is incorrect and should not say 22oz. 

The service is also well below average. If you read many of the average to below average reviews here, you will see this is a trend.

Anyone who eats regularly at Indian restaurants knows that they are mostly the same with similar ambience and similar food; however, this restaurant did not rise to the occasion of \"average\"."}
{"text":"I and my wife visited India Palace yesterday.  After good experience on our last visit, we were surprised with quality of food served. Very disappointing.
We ordered combo appetizer, goat with spinach curry and chicken pasanda

The combo appetizer came without fish which was part of menu. The server served the dish minus  fish saying that he replaced fish with vegetable pakora. What he should have done is to return to us and say that the combo platter could not be completed and whether we would to order some other item or we would like  it as he wants to serve.  This was  poor customer service.  Cost $8:95/- Did not get complete order.

Regards, chicken pasanda.  I have taken this food on many, many occasions in past, infact I grew up eating chicken pasanda. I've never taken chicken pasanda like the one served. It seems the chef does not know what chicken pasanda is and so does not know  to cook it. What is served something which they  call chicken pasanda, but not quite, this is unfortunate. Cost above $15/-. Don't try it.  You will leave frustrated

Regards, goat curry with spinach.  To call this dish disappointing is an understatement.  The goat dish has 95%  bone and 5% meat, mixed with puree of spinach.  Cost above $15/-.  Do not even think of trying this dish.  You will leave frustrated.
No rice or naan was served with any of the above dish.  Poor customer service management.  
I guess the moto of India Palace is, make money while you can."}
{"text":"Delicious! This was my first time having we ate Indian food and it was great. My wife and I had the
Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Curry. We also had Onion Bhaji for an appetizer Garlic Naan bread with diner. Everything was excellent. good service and nice atmosphere. We will be back for more real soon."}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you exactly what we ate, but the restaurant's website keeps redirecting me to eat24hours.com when I click on menu, which has no information on Indian Palace. I'd recommend they resolve that, as it means their website shows every Indian place a person can eat EXCEPT their own.  

Everything we ate here was excellent. We had some kind of appetizer filled with peas and potatoes with a sweet dipping sauce. A roasted garlic flavored flatbread. A smokey grilled variety of meat. Slow cooked lamb in a tomato gravy sauce with nuts. A side of 'pilaf'? rice with peas, roasted garlic and onion. Each item was bursting with flavor. 

We ate late that night around 8pm. The service was great and the staff chatted with us a few times. The food was fresh and the place clean. I'd definitely recommend trying it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend never had lamb until India Palace.  She enjoyed the lamb rogan josh house favorite.  My favorite is the chicken tikka masala.  We tried the saag Paneer and the spices and flavors were amazing.  The service was great and the restaurant was very nice to enjoy a special date night.  We will return when we are craving Indian Cuisine!  The flavor was worth every calorie!"}
{"text":"Having previously lived for yrs in s california I've learned not to judge a restaurant by its neighborhood. This certainly applies with India Palace, as its Twain/Maryland neighborhood leaves everything to be desired. Yet this excellant little place has had me returning over & over for yrs.  Seems like they've never changed their chefs, as the top notch food quality and its uniqueness has not wavered at all.  Service, cleanliness and pleasantness of staff also should be praised."}
{"text":"I cannot believe these reviews.  We were there last week and chose a booth, sat down and the booth was broken with exposed nails.  One of our glasses of water had a fly in it.  We asked for all the food we ordered to be put on the table at once.  It came out in drips and drabs, starting with papadoms that were so stale they did not even crunch.  Soggy! I make them myself and, like crepes, take about 30 seconds to make.  Should be served warm and crispy.  Chana Masala was totally lacking in flavor.  The prawns vindaloo.  You could eat rubber balls in a bland curry sauce and have a better meal.  The tandoori chicken? More like tandoori bones.  Do they actually order from a meatless chicken farm?  This family owned restaurant used to care.  Oh and we asked for our naan to be well done.  Served limp and soggy.  They took it back and brought back burned naan.  I have dined at curry places all over the U.K. and know what Indian cuisine should look and taste like."}
{"text":"A great place for Indian food on Queen Street, with my favourite being their naan bread. Standbys such as the butter chicken are delicious and their dinner special for 2 can feed up to 3 people. The service is decent, with quick water refills and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food! I have visited many Indian places and this is my favorite Indian place now. Great food, service and clean place as well. Must try!"}
{"text":"The spread would be nothing if the flavor isn't there, and I'm pleased to say though that it hits the spot. They strike a good balance between burning hot and lips tingling spicy, I'm also glad to say service was good. Glad I found a place to visit again for quick lunch with friends.."}
{"text":"The management seems to know the formula for a good dining experience here if you're looking for a decent priced, tasty Indian buffet 

Lunch buffet: Good food particularly liked the goat curry and lentils. The naan was good too. The desert section is missing those delicious popular Indian sweet meats, but their rice pudding was decent. 

They told us their meats are HALAL, which is a huge plus for us. 

Our experience: We arrived at 2:30 p.m. and the buffet would close at 3 pm, but the server was friendly and quick. They were able to refill a few of the dishes for us. Shortly after, about six more people came for the buffet so the staff refilled more buffet items. If you come late, please check out the buffet first and request your favorites to be replenished. 


Tip: I used a check-in coupon from Yelp and promptly received a delicious, cold mango lassi. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"Great food! Courteous staff. Good service. I had the chicken masala dish. Very flavorful. Don't be afraid to ask for spicy."}
{"text":"Looking back at the good reviews, my only conclusion is that most of the reviewers dont seem to be Indian. Being an Indian, my tastebuds are used to just the right amount of flavours and spices.My expectations are high and when i try Indian food outside home (which i dont do as often)  i want that food to satisfy my cravings. Honestly i think my mom's a better cook than these guys. I have had better food on the streets of India. I had ordered the dinner special at lunch time for home delivery ??? my mistake as they most likely must have sent me last night's dinner leftovers for lunch - which included naan, rice, matar paneer(eeks too sweet for my liking), lamb korma (damn chewy, tasted like tomato puree with onion pieces- yuck ) and 3 pieces of appetizer - tandoori chicken - dry and burnt (most likely from the previous night), chicken and lamb kabab - ehhhh, what can i say !  What a disappointing way to begin a saturday."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE India Palace!!! We eat the buffet every weekend. The food is consistently great- our favorite is the chicken tikka masala. Recently they started serving halva (sorry spelling)- a pudding with nuts, dried fruit, and coconut, which is amazing. The service is great and the people are so wonderful and friendly. Highly recommend :-)"}
{"text":"This was my second time here. India palace is clean and comfortable. Manny led us thru our meal. We started with onion pec pecora and garlic nan. We had lamb, vegetables and desert. Food was the most amazing in LAS VEGAS and Manny did not  disappoint with service. This is a must try.....a little behind the strip but must visit."}
{"text":"Ordered bhindi masala and tarka daal. Spice level was very adequate. The tanduri roti was really good as well. Definite recommendation for someone who is looking for authentic north Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Decided to end our fun vegas weekend with some indian food... Glad we chose this place....customer service was amazing, food was authentic & the price was amazing! Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"I have only gone for the lunch buffet and I must say it is pretty good. All the servers are nice not great but nice. This is my go to Indian joint when I am craving Indian. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery several times and have not been disappointed. I'll briefly rate a few of the individual items we've tried: vegetable pakoras (5/5), samosas (3/5), garlic naan (3.5/5), chicken tikka masala (4.5/5), matar paneer (4/5). So for my tastes, things range but can be very good. In general I would say some of the sauces are just a little sweeter than I prefer, but I'm a salt fanatic so it's probably not an issue for most people. Packaging for delivery is always good and usually has come with free papadum. Prices are not cheap, but a la carte pricing is similar to competing restaurants."}
{"text":"This is not the place for a take out. The women look too confused and it them hours to get it right. Food is okay, but not the staff. They look tired and least interested in running the business."}
{"text":"I have been to India five times and love Indian food. This place is fantastic!  The menu has several things that are not usually on the menu ( vada, dosa, goat dishes and ground chicken).  We started off with papadum served with three fragrant dipping sauces- coriander chutney, chili chutney and  tamarind. I was already sold. Each one was flavorful and pungent. We then moved on to an all vegetarian meal. The Dahi vada ( lentil cake with yogurt and tamarind )were to die for- moist, with a thin aromatic sauce. They are often dry with a heavy sauce not here !  We also has Malai Kofta, which was also delicious, aloo tikka with channa, and Bindi Masala (okra). I cannot say enough good things. We were three people and we had a lot of leftovers to take home 
Our waiter was Garry and he was all smiles and so appreciative that we liked the food. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"India Palace is my favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas.  My favorite dishes are the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken Makhani.  The cheese naan and garlic naan are also excellent.  The servers are friendly and helpful with recommending dishes, especially our favorite server Garry.  We use certificates from Restuarant.com every time we go to save money."}
{"text":"The location is a bit odd, but the inside is quite nice and the food is really pretty good. The korma was addictively delicious."}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian options for dinner and great service with easy access from the strip. Nice wine list if you don't mind buying a bottle (if you don't drink it all you can take it with)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only is the food delicious and authentic, but the service is unparalleled. We came back here after a great experience last year and weren't sure whether we'd be disappointed but we couldn't have been more wrong! Our server Manny was so thoughtful - he told us we'd get a free mango lassi if we checked in on yelp and also about a $20 for $30 deal! Best Indian place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The lunch Buffet has got very limited options.....The food is not worth the price we paid for buffet....they were over charging....

The staff was very rude ...We interacted with 3 servers......all of them were rude/sarcastic....

Desis avoid it..."}
{"text":"It is a good sign when you walk into a restaurant and see that the  majority of customers are of the same native as the menu. This is my experiance.  The food was great!  Service was friendly and helpful in selecting dishes. Prices are very well priced.  One of the best Indian resaurants in the country!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly nice all round. The neighborhood is no great shakes but the restaurant is top notch."}
{"text":"Food is good. But the attitude not so good. If you can not honor the groupon or yelp coupons.. then why do you guys issue them anyways?  So you have a $30 for $20 deal at yelp. And a 'free' mango lassi at yelp checkin. But the 'rude' waiter says... You can't use both the coupons.  Never going back again.. :("}
{"text":"We went in with little expectations, food was absolutely delicious. We tried the buffet.. the spread was generous and at a pretty affordable 13$ pre tax. Would highly recommend paneer saag and the masala chai.."}
{"text":"Excellent food, cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, fair prices, what more could you ask for! This is the place to go in the North Valley if  you like Indian food."}
{"text":"The food in buffet was good n the people nice n friendly. For me the food could have been better if more spicy.... The food and restaurant was good :)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Vick was awesome!! I live at henderson but I drive all the way here to get masala dosa! It's delicious. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at India Palace for ten years. Imagine my surprise when I my favorite Indian restaurant now completely renovated. The building is now very modern and upgraded. I had the lunch buffet today and was pleasantly surprised that chicken tika masala is now part of the buffet. Still my favorite menu item. I highly recommend the lunch buffet if this is your first foray into Indian cuisine. My only quibble is that the dinner menu averages $15 per entree. A little high, but well worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Recently I had been here with my family. Being a south Indian we were craving for authentic south Inidan food and were delighted to find this place in yelp. We were 7 and all of us relished the food. Service was great. Kids especially \" liked the tandoori chicken."}
{"text":"Terrific food, good service, nice menu selection make for an outstanding experience at this restaurant. My new favorite Indian food restaurant in the Phoenix area! The selection of naan breads is particularly good. Also impressed with the wait staff who were always refilling our drinks and checking on us. Will be back again and again..."}
{"text":"This place has the most awesome food and best service. Manni is the best server ever and made our visit most memorable !!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Seriously can't get enough of the customer service ,hospitality, and most importantly the food!!"}
{"text":"Food was satisfactory, do not have any complains. I tried only Paneer item and it was just fine.

When we asked for free water then they came up saying machine is broken they have only bottled water... Pese banane ka Desi tareeka... :)"}
{"text":"Never call them for an order.
The guy i called for order was rude and impolite .
I am writing this review even before tasting the food, the guy on the phone go me really worked up. I am saying this even though i am an Indian, Staff at Indian restaurants can be a total ass!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Indian cuisine in Phoenix! Authentic, Service is great! Defiantly coming back."}
{"text":"Never ever buy groupon for this restaurant. We had confirmed with restaurant before buying the groupon but when we checked in they denied. Why do you sell your groupon's if they are not redeemable. There were no blackout dates. Pathetic restaurant would be waste of time anyways.Never going to recommend visit this place again."}
{"text":"Consumer Beware! Beware! before going to this  restaurant! They have raised all their prices--including Buffet which is now at a ridiculous $14.95 per person! Nowhere do they inform you of the new prices until u get the bill! we ordered from the menu as well and the quantity is a JOKE - even one person cannot eat on the ridiculously priced dal!

The buffet was even worse with STALE food, empty buffet trays that were being refilled at snails pace with just a few pieces of chicken that are now cut in half than previously served. Dessert milk had gone bas with pungent taste, bread was cold, tixe was hard as a rock (which means it was from the day before and re- heated)!! Glasses smelled similar to foul meat which means not cleaned thoroughly. We are very dissappointed - we were regulars at this restaurant and don't know what happened! Maybe its new management or maybe its just the want to make money and let go of quality and serve your customers horrendous quality of food- whatever the case - they have gone downhill!! Save yourself the bad experience and do not eat here - not worth it anymore! for this price you can eat at a fancy restaurant in vegas!! 

On a positive note the waiters are nice. and thats about it on the niceness part. 

A note to management: do not rip un suspecting customers- your prices have gone up and quality is horrible!"}
{"text":"Amazing Food!!! Felt Like sitting in India eating Goat Ragan Josh and Karahi Chicken with Onion Kulcha!!! Garry the server also makes you feel you are eating in India with his hospitality. India Palace is amazing !! The best in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I live in North Scottsdale and found this gem when I was out my Indian friend.
Absolutely wonderful and according to my friend, AUTHENTIC.
Everything is homemade.

The owners and their family are lovely and make you feel at home, loved and welcome. I don't usually encounter that in my neck of the woods.
Highly recommend.
The lunch buffet was excellent."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! Definitely will be back for more of that vegetarian dinner special and garlic naan!"}
{"text":"Whoever heard of serving Chicken Masala without rice? An outrage. This place serves chicken masala in a bowl full of sauce and expects you to eat it without soaking up the sauce with rice. About halfway through my meal when I had little chicken and a lot of sauce left the waiter finally asked me if I wanted some rice. Little did I know at the time that the rice (barely enough for two) would cost an extra $4.....outrageous! I have NEVER been to an india restaurant that didn't serve their dishes with rice on the side. But this one seems to want to soak you for every dollar they can get. Decent food but at a steep price. I wont be back."}
{"text":"I am an indian, so I can tell you exactly how the food is.
So at first, the service was friendly and good.
The food was not good, the taste was not authentic. I ordered f.e. Paneer Tikka and the Paneer Tikka Masala. The Tikka was tasting like Chinese food and the other was to sweet. 
Everything else was also not authentic and not good tastin

I give two stars because it was clean and a good service. My opinion is not to recommend that restaurant."}
{"text":"Food tasted good.

Service is slow and place is not tidy. I have seen server clean tables and then next minute, serve food without washing hands."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is really awesome specially Garry. He rocks. We will be back."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food , service is good, i will definitely have food here again.
One of the good indian restaurant in las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was searching for a decent Indian food while visiting Las Vegas. I couldn't have found a better and reasonable place. India Place has great food, good friendly hospitality. The pricing is also great. Above all, after roaming in the hot sun, I was quite contended by the awesome food. The house favorites malai kofta and paneer tikka are really good."}
{"text":"Soo many good things to say about here, they are an established restaurant, the cooks are actually Indian and know how to cook Indian food, the staff are super friendly and most importantly the BEST Indian food my husband and I have ever eaten(this is out of the 3 major cities we have lived in)  Good flavors and good selection.  Delicious.  Go soon, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Ive been here 2 times. Not located in the best neighborhood but it doesnt bother me because when we walk in, its very clean and friendly.  As we walked in, we saw a wall full of pictures and saw the owner photographed with some celebrities that have also been there. One that caught my eye was the celeb that played the host in Slumdog millionaire. As they escorted us to our table, we get greeted by waiters that remembered us from last time. There has been a lot of customers both times we have been there but still got amazing service. 

Plus, My mother in law who is from England is very picky when it comes to food. Before she left to England we took her to eat here. 

She loves Indian food and brags about the indian food restaurants in England. But when my husband and I brought her here, she ate so much she couldnt stop saying how delicious it all was. 
The service has been super both times. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"Had the worst customer service experience possible. First of all , there wasnt a server who came to attend us for almost 20 minutes. When we did ask them, they were very rude and told us tht we were lucky enough to even get a seat. This happened eventhough there wasnt any waiting.  At last, when someone did attend to us, they didnt serve us any food for atleast 60 minutes. After which we did complain to the owner who was no better then any of the servers themselves.By the time we received our food, everyone else who had arrived after us were done with the food. We were really dissapointed with the discriminating attitude and rude behaviour of everyone in the restaurant. Even if the food is good , that doesnt explain the bad customer service. We were in vegas for a trip but  they really were the worst people in whole of vegas we have been to. So i advise all tourists, If you dont have  atleast  2 hours to waste   and on top of it listen to the rude attendants, dont even bother being there.

NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"i really wanted to like this place since it had such good reviews. however, we just got delivery from india palace, and both entrees (chicken tikka masala and chicken saag) arrived sans rice...seriously? garlic naan was good, but that was about it. salad arrived with *no* dressing, and with a hair on it...FML. so we paid $45 for delivery food that we had to supplement the entrees on rice, and salad we couldn't/ wouldn't eat. when we called the restaurant to ask if something had been mixed up, they confirmed that they do NOT give rice with entrees for delivery/ takeout orders--you have to order it separately from your entree...what a joke. would not try this place again."}
{"text":"We had dinner here a few weeks ago. The taste of the food was excellent. However, what was very disappointing was the portion size of the dishes. We had garlic naan which was good and an eggplant dish and chicken tikka masala. The chicken was cut in chunks and there were barely enough pieces to equal one chicken breast. No exaggeration! Same with the eggplant--barely enough to share with another person. Buffet lunch may be a better deal. Extremely disappointing for such good food and high ratings. No future visits here."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian Restaurants in Las Vegas. Great service, Amazing food and comfortable environment. You must try the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Rohan Josh, both great in flavor and spices. No Indian dish is good with out some garlic naan, which were the best I ever had. This is a must try restaurant in Las Vegas top notch, keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"A friend suggested this joint and I was not really sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised, this is the best Indian food I've had in Las Vegas! We enjoyed the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and aloo gobi and it was all amazing! I can't wait to go back and do it all over again."}
{"text":"I ate at the Indian Palace a year ago, had the chicken curry and it was incredible. Just ate there again, had the same thing and it was not good. I don't know what happened, how it could go from incredible to below average. This time the chicken curry was almost tasteless. I asked to have only breast meat as I did a year ago and what I got this time was not all breast meat. I went in looking forward to the awesome dinner and service like I got a year ago and was extremely disappointed. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"I got the mixed curry dinner with shrimp, chicken, and lamb. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time today.. great buffet with lots of selection.. Naan comes to your table fresh from the tandoor... service was excellent.. decor very nice. I enjoyed the chicken tikka masala and plo rice.. this is absolutely to die for!"}
{"text":"Never really ate here in the restaurant setting. However, we had our food catered from this restaurant for our wedding. The food was really good. There were some dishes here and there that were not perfect, but who's perfect anyway? They still get 5 stars. The owner really listens to you when it comes to how you want your dishes to taste. Not many places do that these days. The quality of food at the restaurant is not the same. We did eat a taste-test at the restaurant and told the owner what minute changes we wanted made. The owner did mention that catered food is all freshly made to order which was great. They added extra paneer and chicken at our request. All our guests really did rave about the food from here. Would definitely recommend for dining in (as the restaurant food itself was still very good) and if you're having a party or wedding, this is the place to pick for catering."}
{"text":"4 star ratings for such awful food is what makes me doubt yelp ratings. Leaving the dated and dirty atmosphere aside, I had the worst masala dosa ever at this place. The sambar was bad, masala had no taste and the chutneys were horrible. I walked a mile from the Wynn going by its 4 star rating but highly disappointed. I've tried Tamba a few times I've been to vegas before. Go there instead for a much better ambience and food for probably the same price."}
{"text":"The food is amazing; complex spice and always prepared perfectly. The staff is amazing and the prices, although not cheap, are not bad at all. Easily my favorite place in the North Valley."}
{"text":"Every dish was packed full of flavor and cooked perfectly! I highly recommend it to all lovers of Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I've visited here during lunch and dinner. Their lunch buffet is modest but worth the price! There are meat and vegetarian options, with each being flavorful. Their dinner options are also delicious. I especially love their Murg Makhani & Chicken Tikka Masala! The staff are attentive and friendly. Wait times are minimal. However, having to pay extra for rice during dinner seems a little silly to me. That appears to be common in Phoenix, though.

I recommend India Palace for their high quality of food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, and Yum!  The garlic naan is to die for!  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I would give - or 0 star to this place. Food was ok, but as soon i got home i thowup everything. My husband and i both got Diarrhea. Not sure how they make food. Properly not fresh. When i tried to contact manger, i felt i was lying about getting sick. Do not recommend to anyone to get there"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Vegas, I make sure that I eat there once. They serve really good food with good quantity. The prices are also very well marked. The owners, the servers, and there is one elderly Indian lady who is really nice. She went out of her way to get some milk for our child which we really appreciated.
Once we reached after the lunch buffet was closed and the owner still made all the servers wait till we finished our food. 
It is a good place and has a nice atmosphere inside the restaurant. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Manpreet aka Manny is awesome. He totally helped us out and fed us soooo much food.....we could hardly move. Awesome food amazing service. A favorite when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I found this gem of a place through an online restaurant service and made a reservation. As soon as we entered the door, we were greeted by very friendly people and were seated immediately. Service was fantastic! The waiter Manny was very friendly, attentive and helpful. He The Paneer Tikka and the Aloo Tikka was fantastic. My favorite was the Malai Kofta. The food was wonderful and the service was phenomenal. Coming from out of town and staying on the strip, I was pleased to have found a such a nice cozy place outside of the tourist area that made me feel comfortable. As a matter of fact, there was an Indian restaurant right at the hotel I was staying at, but I'd rather go to India palace instead. Actually, I did... Twice! Two thumbs up for service and food! Oh, and I will definitely be going back again on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food, do not get Rasmalai ,"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 10 years and I have yet to have disappointing food or service.  I agree the service can border on being overly attentive at times.  Everybody is warm and friendly and eager to have you as a guest.  I can heartily recommend India Palace to both vegetarians and carnivores alike.  I've visited with a large group of vegetarians and there were nothing but compliments.  So now the food:

The thing to start with, especially with a group is the assorted naan breads.  My favorites include Keema which is naan with minced lamb, Garlic and Poori which is fried whole wheat bread.  The naan rounds out what seem to some as small portions.  When you have naan, your entree of choice with the aromatic Basmati rice you have a very generous serving of food.

No matter what you order, I recommend getting rice as a nice complement to the sauces and curries.  I'm not a vegetarian, but enjoy the spices of the Channa (chickpeas) Masala.  The goat Saag in spinach and herb is delicious.  The meat is so tender and juicy it can best most steaks.  I can say that about the chicken and lamb as well.

To top it off, India Palace serves a great selection of beers from India including Hayward 5000, Taj Mahal and King Fisher.  I find Taj Mahal the most refreshing almost sweet tasting, and it goes well if you like your food spicy.

Bottom line: very attentive service, delicious variety, very tender, very juicy meats and Indian beer.  You can tell the ingredients are high quality and worth the upscale price."}
{"text":"Best indian restaurant hands down!!! Ask for Gary for 5 star service! Vegan friendly 
Great selection of Indian beers. Haywards 5000 and Flying horse my top picks."}
{"text":"My entire family has been dining with this restaurant for over. 20 years. Never disappointed! Try the chicken tikka masala palak paneer and Palou rice"}
{"text":"I've only eaten the buffet here and it was good but nothing special.  To be fair, most Indian buffets are pretty similar, it's only when you order from the menu that you see if the restaurant is really a stand-out.  So, I will update this review when I've gone there for dinner"}
{"text":"I was just here yesterday because Tandoori Times was closed. I was disappointed about it until they brought out the food. The presentation was lovely! The paneer tikka was sizzling and gorgeous. The paneer was a perfect level of spice and unlike Tandoori Times, not dry. The veggies in it were delicious and juicy and crunchy. My mother ordered the paneer masala, which came out looking just as good. Medium spice was perfect and the peas and bell peppers in it were abundant and delicious. The waitress had a vibrant personality, very helpful. The entire restaurant was empty, that was surprising for 6pm on a Monday. It is rather large, nice atmosphere, weird Indian videos on the tv. Oh and the Chai tea is superb.

I'm eating my leftovers right now as I write this. Still good! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my best indian food spot whenever I come to Vegas. Beautiful decor, good value, delicious flavored. I have tried other indian restaurants in the area, but this one stands out. Specially tandoori chicken & wings. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Second visit here on Christmas day and again had wonderful experience. Even though wait was long but it was worth it as the food was really authentic and tasty. Must visit this place if you like indian food. Adan and Nelroy were awesome and provided very good service. Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"While the food was very good and the service is great, the prices are a little high for what you get. I read some of the complaints prior to going to eat that the portions were skimpy, yet I was still caught off guard by the meager portions. Should you decide to take out, be warned that the portions get even smaller. I haven't hit the lunch buffet up yet, it might be a better value."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good Indian food with warm hospitality. Try: samosas, malai kofta, mutter paneer, lamb vindaloo and the amazing rice pudding (kir)!"}
{"text":"We compared prices with the neighbors places and this is one was cheapest.
The all you can eat menu had many options like chicken, beef and lamb in their different combinations. They served warm naans for us.  It was a little bit spicy but goood! 
I will go back for a quick, cheap, decent indian food option"}
{"text":"I have been dining in this restaurant since last 10 years .Great restaurant ..I also regularly order take outs which are made  exactly the way I want as my lady is scared of spices ...hot stuff but at the same time craves for their chicken masala...mild..I never had any complaints..Service is excellent.. GARY is great..polite and very accomodating..Owners are nice people and have genuine concerns of their costomers I always recommend all my friends to india palace for authentic North Indian food
Great food
Great service (GARY)
I give them 5 stars..of course their is always room for further improvement"}
{"text":"Buffet on weekday which I went was not delicious. Customer service regarding cleaning and removing plates is pathetic. If you sit in the corner during buffet they do not pay attention to serve your table."}
{"text":"Don't let the sketchy area keep you away, the food pisses amazing! I've been twice and had the goat curry both times. I actually stabbed my dinner partner in the hand when he reached for a bite. The cheese bread is so good and is perfect with the green mint sauce. The staff is excellent at describing the dishes and both times they have brought me samples from the kitchen at no charge! I would have given 4 stars if not for the fact I found hair in my goat the last time I visited. It ended the meal, I but I will likely be back for more. I'll just hope there are hairnets back in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Never expect amazing food from any of the India Palaces and Taj Mahals. There was a private party going on and the kids were running around, yelling and misbehaving. The restaurant should have closed admission to general public or have asked the private party for courtesy.

Service was good, food was mediocre. We went because this was the closest place and everything else had waiting. Rightfully so."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Indian food until I found Indian Palace, now at their 3rd location in less than 10 years, and despite that the location keeps changing, the food stays consistent (which is a rarity).  

Their lunch buffet is one of the most diverse I've ever seen from an Indian restaurant, with 2 rice dishes (bryani and basmati), several vegetable dish choices and several meat choices.  small tossed salad and dessert as well at chai round out the offerings.

My favorites are the Chicken Tikka Masala, Bryani and spinach, but I eat almost everything there.  It is the best Indian food I've had...ever."}
{"text":"The driver was late and the food was WAY too little (quantity) for the amount we got. $60 for what amounts to be appetizers. Really go EFF YOURSELVES. And we tried to call the manager because the order was wrong anyway and they gave us the run around. Save your money And go to a buffet. These guys are crap."}
{"text":"This place made my super picky, not very adventurously eating boyfriend fall in love with Indian food.  He orders his food \"extra mild\" and it comes out awesome every time.  They have some kind of whole wheat naan stuffed with onions and herbs that is really delicious.  I love the Bollywood music videos, and this restaurant is really nice on the inside."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, reasonably priced. I've been to several Indian restaurants in AZ and this is definitely one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome!!!! Vick met us with exceptional hospitality and recommended all the right dishes and drinks to satisfy my palate!! 
The Harvard 5000 was a rushing beer with the correct poignancy of alcohol. (Vick recommended).
Tandoori Fish is amazing, cheese spinach is so good Olive Oil would be happy the serve to Popeye. Everything was superb!!!

Thanks Vic!!

{"text":"I ordered dinner take out. The food taste was 4 stars. One star reduced as the meat used tasted not fresh. Paneer was good. Rice seemed to be cooked hours back and left on heat."}
{"text":"India Palace is by far one of the better Indian restaurants in Toronto.  The waiters are attentive as well as knowledgeable and  I received my food quickly.  I ordered the Butter Chicken and Tandoori Chicken along with some rice and naan (that free comes with any Tandoori dish order).  The generous portion of Butter Chicken was tangy and flavourful.  The Tandoori Chicken was delicious too and both dishes were perfectly complimented with the fresh Rice and Naan Bread.

The Decor also enhanced my dining experience along with the wonderful music playing in the background. I highly recommended India Palace for anyone looking for an Authentic Indian dining experience."}
{"text":"We purchased a Living Social deal $15 for $30 credit on a recent trip to Vegas-- I gotta say, I would definitely go back even without the deal. 

Pros: THE FOOD. Reasonably priced. These were more than enough for two people. (We had leftovers & ordered extra naan for later)
Lamb Rogan Josh $15.95 
Plain Basmati Rice $3.95
Chicken Tikka masala $14.95
Garlic Naan $2.95
Their free mango drink when you check in is soooo goood. 

Cons: Nothing really. Just the service was a little slow. They had a private party going on in another room. But our server, Garry, was great!

Basically, worth checking out. Bomb Indian food. Entertaining music videos on tv. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"India Palace is the best Indian Restaurant to my taste in Las Vegas.

I have been going here for the past 8 years and have not once felt the food to be unsatisfactory and only once have I found one of the staff members to be difficult (He hasn't been there for years, however.).

To understand the reasons why they are the best would take me the better part of a book, so with the exception of a few highlights, I will encourage you to experience this food experience for yourself - altogether a more satisfying experience than reading any review!

First off, since they are a ubiquitous and primary form of Indian Food consumption, I have to rave about their lunch buffet.  At about $13, India Palace will cost you that extra dollar or two over Mint (which is more Nepalese, if I'm not mistaken), Mt. Everest or India Oven, but not even Ghandi's excellent fare is close in quality and variety.  Every day there is a pilaf, lentils, Tandoori Chicken, a Saag dish, a Korma, a Tikka, a Masala, a Salad, both Mango Custard and Kheer, Naan and Sauces (Raita, Tamarind, Mint and a few others.).  For a vegetarian, this is one of the best buffets for you.  The break down always has at least 4-5 vegetarian selections in addition to the rice and lentils - most others are not nearly as diverse.  For the carnivore, the selection is by no means meager - at least 1-2 chicken dishes plus tandoor and a lamb or goat dish.  Alone, the spread is great, but, having eaten here dozens of times, I have to comment that the clencher for me is the fact that I can't tell a difference in quality between the lunch food and the dinner food.  This can't be said, in my opinion, of others.  

Secondly, I find, despite the opinions of others, the dinner to be reasonably priced for the quality.  If you consider that Indian restaurants are usually priced well-above other non-European, Ethnic cuisines, it is easy to think of them as pricey, but the complexity of Indian curries and the time-to-cook makes them cheap if you compare them to a steak.  Also, if you consider the consistent quality of the food, India Palace is worth the extra buck you MIGHT pay over Bollywood or Mint.  Additionally, I find them to be cheaper than Tamba or Origin.

What can I say, I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"If anyone is in Toronto and craving Indian food then you should try this place. The service is friendly and the food is fantastic. Thanks Linda and Yanal for bringing us here."}
{"text":"Visited the Indian Palace for the first time on Sunday- I'm an expat Britt constantly looking for my new Indian local. This may be it! The food was the best I've had state side. I've been searching for a place that would make me a lamb tikka korma- and nowhere has it listed or ever tried until now. The chef whipped one up and it tasted amazing. They even have onion bhaji too, and my minimum requirement a keema naan. My friend has the vegetable korma which was also easily one of the best I've tried.

The staff were very friendly, very accommodating and the food tasted excellent. I will be visiting again and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a down to earth place that's serves delicious food."}
{"text":"Everything is good except for the food. I chicken was rubbery the other meats and even the veggies weren't worth. Second time but not sure if I would go back anytime soon or reco me to anyone"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the second time and I really love the food here . So much flavor in all of the dishes I've tried . The Tikka Masala was amazing, fast friendly service . Haven't had a chance to try the buffet yet as it's only available at lunch but looking forward to trying more dishes here ! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Best Chicken Tikka Masala.
The Best Cheese Nann.
Very friendly & Clean.
Spent like $75.00 for family of 4 eating family style. Works for me!
Cons the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Manny is the best! Great service and delicious food. Don't forget to check in at yelp, too :)"}
{"text":"Food and service were both great. However, the reason I'm giving this place a 5 star review is for the absolute professionalism they exhibited. I had a living social voucher to the place and because of some glitch in the app, the voucher number wouldn't show. I was ready to pay the actual amount but the owner of the restaurant said he would honor the Living Social. What?! I'm sure most other places would've been happy to keep the full amount!"}
{"text":"Came back today and was very disappointed.  I forgot to order rice, but my veggie meal with garlic naan still came out to nearly $15.  Of course, the naan disappeared fast, so then I had nothing to eat with the rest of my baingan bartha.  Which was unfortunate, because it was extremely salty - as in, I can barely taste anything but saltiness.  

What happened?  This is my usual dish, and it's always been yummy before.  Looking at the reviews, it looks like a few others have noticed a decline in quality over the past couple months.

Considering the price I paid and the fact that I won't be able to finish my meal, I feel pretty ripped off.  I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's the worst indian food ever, Service is too bad.

 
They have spring rolls in the buffet, these rolls are not even worth of a try  I just took a byte and left it there.Tandoori was a joke, over all food is really bad tasted like leftover's.

Looks they don't care about the customers, that's how the service was. If you go there get ready to be treated as if u r a free customer."}
{"text":"I love India Palace. It's located in a not so prime location but once you enter the restaurant, you forget what the exterior is like.  The atmosphere has an elegant feel to it but doesn't require a person dining to be dressed up.  The servers are all friendly and are very good at checking up on their patrons.  Their food is delicious!  I have tried their chicken tikka masala, chicken saag, lamb saagwala, goat curry, lamb briyani, samosas, and their naan bread (garlic is my favorite) and they were all so awesomely delish!  Don't forget to order a side a mango lassi cause theirs is definitely one the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, not even close to what Indian food suppose to be like. Never visiting again !"}
{"text":"Went in for the buffet and wasn't disappointed. They had a good selection and everything was fresh. Took the 'rents and my dad went up three times. That's a good sign that everything was good. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  We loved the Vegetarian dinner, such great flavor and a beautiful presentation.  I also liked the fact that when I ordered a \"mild\" dish, it was mild.  Yummo!"}
{"text":"Great service, and delicious food! Always seems to be plenty of staff on hand and your glass hardly ever gets below half full. The neighborhood isn't the best, but India Palace is worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"I like Indian curry a lot so I was excited to find a lunch buffet nearby, with good Yelp feedbacks and inexpensive price $8.99 per adult.  But...I was pretty disappointed to see this lunch buffet is so small and very limited items. Only 3 meat dishes (2 chicken dishes and minced lamb), 6 vegetarian choices, served with plain seasoned rice and plain naan, plus a mini salad bar.  Comes with hot tea (self-serve).

Food taste OK, some are good, but I don't expect excellent food for buffet though.  

2 star for the buffet selection. 
4 star for good service and dining environment. 

I might go back for a quick lunch if I'm craving for curry and naan, and hope to find lamb cubes in buffet too.  I was expecting some lamb cube dishes (as seen in other Yelper's lunch buffet photos) but I only found minced lamb. 

Will probably try their dinner menu in future, hoping that dinner entrees taste better. But for now I continue my search for good Indian buffets in town. 

Btw,  buffet price for little kids is $5.99 which I think it's kind of expensive for a 4-6 year old, since most dishes are spicy, so kids are mostly eating rice and naan.  I guess it's OK for bigger kids who like spicy food."}
{"text":"I am a local here in Las Vegas and have been to India Palace many, many times in the past 12 + years after moving here from Canada. 
I will say that the quality of the food has gone downhill.....
The portions have become a LOT smaller...and the prices seem to be going up by the month ! 
The service sucks and the owner, Mr. Heera seems to think we are all doing HIM a favor by eating at his restaurant !!
I will NEVER go back..nor will i EVER recommend this restaurant to anyone again. 
There are PLENTY of other great choices in Vegas ! 
Jenn"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! The service is amazing and the food is impeccable. Definitely a place I crave often."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great atmosphere. Food was a bit expensive but totally worth it. Went on a Thursday evening and it was still crowded. Usually a really good sign considering that the restaurant is in a weird part of Las Vegas (looked shady). The inside of the restaurant was really well decorated and we felt comfortable once we settled in. Checked in on Yelp and got a free mango lassi. Wow...really tasty.
Had the samosas and aloo tikki. Both good. Had the non veg curry thali and all the components was fantastic except the mango custard. Next time I will try something else. It came with Lamb in spinach, chicken tikka masala and shrimp curry. Excellent. 
We will be back soon"}
{"text":"After going to an Indian restaurant called Tamba on the strip(which is very expensive yet very bad), this restaurant is a relief. It has decent food(both veg and non veg). 

Pros:

Good Indian food in Vegas. Sambar needs special mention here. It is really authentic in taste.

Decently priced and serves buffet.

Staff is very friendly and good ambience.

Cons:

Far from Strip, so for dinner, it would be a bad idea. Lunch is fine.

Less number of varieties compared to other restaurants. The dessert could be improved a bit."}
{"text":"Food and service were both excellent. We had vegetable pakoras, the rack of lamb dinner, and fish tikka masala. Pakoras we're crispy and tasty. The lamb and the fish were both cooked perfectly, very tender. The side dishes and the custard that came with the lamb were all delicious. Everything came out quickly and well paced so we never had too much food on the table. Overall, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice Biryani, Tandoori Chicken and great atmosphere.

Wish they were closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever the friendly environment you should try the lamb korma and garlic naan deal will get addicted to it"}
{"text":"Worst Indian restaurant ever. Especially if I were the owner of the restaurant I would fire the dumb waiters who have no idea how to treat the customers.

The guy literally forces the customers to sit where he thinks they should be seated and not let them choose. I actually witnessed the waiter insulted/discriminated a set of customers, like heyyy can you sit here? no you cant sit there. It was shockingly unbelievable the way they were treated. It was like they were some homeless people walked into the restaurant. They were em brassed by the tone and guess what, they said I dont need this and left the place. why? because they dont have to put up with this crap especially considering there are 2 other indian restaurants right next to this India palace, better too.

This is the worst kind of business anyone can ever think of. 

About the food, the butter chicken literally had bad meat, chicken that has gone bad. It was like one piece was good, and if you chew other pieces random ones, it hit me with this taste of spoiled chicken. The thought of it makes me want to puke. Nothing tastes disgusting than eating spoiled meat.

I think they recycle the left over meat and mix up with the one they make everyday since its buffet.

It is unacceptable. 

I am never going there ever again. I wanted to go to little india, or Trimurti, both of them were very good in my experiences. This place left me with the bad taste of Indian food and I may never get over the spoiled meat taste from their ridiculous butter chicken, I am lucky that I didn't feel sick later or diarrhoea, it will take a while for me to think of butter chicken again (yuck!!!) 

Worst restaurant I've ever been in Toronto. Worst discriminating service, I would have let that slide if the food was at least good and healthy, but thats not the case. Stay away if you dont wanna get sick...Go to Trimurti or Little India or regency in Gerrard street."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here today and the food was amazing the service was great. they serve chai tea and naan with the meal. I'm heading back soon!  Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"We went there for a buffet lunch. This was around 2:00 pm. Not too late I suppose. 

Let me directly come to the food since that what matters the most, at least in this budget range of indian rest. Everything was cold. Didn't look freshly made. Avoid non veg if possible. If I may say so there was a chicken starter seemingly labelled as tandoori chicken. Far from it. Most of the dishes seemed to lack any taste to it. Maybe ala carte from the menu would have been a better choice. Kheer was passable with lots of synthetic flavors. 

Staff and other aspects were not a big worry. Though charged 2 10 year olds full price for the buffet. 

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good Indian restaurant in Vegas since we moved from NYC and read about India Palace so decided to check it out for dinner.  It was pretty quiet on a Sunday night.  There were only a few other patrons, which is a shame because our experience at India Palace was great.  As other Yelpers mention, they are located near the Strip but on the border of a crappy neighborhood.  I wonder if they were in a better location if they would have more diners, but I digress.
They served papadum and 3 different dipping sauces when we sat down, which was very nice.
We started with the kheema samosas for an appetizer.  The shell was nice and crispy and not greasy at all.  They were filled with delicious ground lamb and green peas.  I thought it was wonderful with the date sauce (the dark brown one) on it.
We ordered the chicken korma and chicken tikka masala for entrees.  Both were very good.  The chicken was very tender.  The entrees didn't come with rice, as has been our experience at most Indian restaurants, so we had ordered a side of peas pulao rice and garlic naan.  I loved the rice with peas and nuts in it.  The garlic naan was also very good and not greasy at all.
Service was attentive and all the staff very friendly.  The restaurant was neat and clean.  There were TVs playing Bollywood which was fun.  They weren't on too loud and I always find it hard to not watch!  Our waiter provided us with containers to pack our leftovers.  If we weren't so full, I would have liked to try their dessert menu.
Our dinner came out to about $60, including tax and tip.  Indian food is always a little pricey, so I thought it was good value for what we got.
We enjoyed our experience here and will definitely be back to try other menu items, the dosas in particular.
They honored the free mango lassi for checking in, which was delicious with my meal. Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Best indian food, very tasty. We tried many dishes and each was wonderful. EXCELLENT service by Manny. He was very social and attentive. WE highly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and I'm stuffed. It was sooooo good! It reminds me of when my friends from India used to cook in undergrad. And Gerry was a great host and server. I will definitely be going back. Hopefully soon."}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday after reading so much positive reviews.  It seems a large of guests finished and just left before I went.  The staff seems to have indifferent attitude towards new customers walking in.  They were only a handful of staff who were involved in clearing the tables and not attending the guests.  Refilling food takes long time and need to end up waiting.  Staff seems to be not worried about updating guests and just said that refilling would take time.  Wish never had gone to this place."}
{"text":"The wait time is more than 1 hour no matter at what time of the year one goes for lunch. The food is only average. One of the waiters was very rude and misbehaved with us. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice Cleen place in Lasvegas  I love onion culcha, paneer Tikal masala kheer gulab juman  RANA  is good cook & garry Jagtar is good Maneger  all the people work so nice I enjoy the food so much thanks everybody"}
{"text":"We knew we'd made a good choice when we walked in and found that almost all the other patrons were Indian families.  Very good food, comparing favorably with good Indian restaurants near our home in northern California.  Would get 5 stars, but they're a shade pricey."}
{"text":"I never know what I will get when I go to India Palace.  Will the rice be crunchy and dry?  Will it take the waiter 30 minutes to give me my check after my plates are cleared?  Will I get stabbed? Generally, the answer is no, which makes it one of the better Indian spots in town.

But, don't get too excited. The lunch buffet is the only reason to come here.  Dinner is incredibly overpriced ($20 for a vegetarian platter is crazy, crazy).   Why spend $15-20 for one bland dish for dinner when you can get the lunch AYCE selection of bland dishes for less than $20?.  Save your dinner pennies for something better -- this is not the best Indian you will ever have, no matter what the Review Journal says.

Bright spots on the menu include Lamb Korma (lamb in a creamy, coconuty sauce), Aloo Gobi (sauteed potatoes and cauliflower) and Saag Paneer (creamed spinach with homemade cheese).   I also like their renovations, they've greatly improved the atmosphere.

Sad spots include burned naan, rather bland food, small servings of rice (with dinner entrees), and dirty looks from waiters when ordering mixed pickles and chutney (I have no idea what that's all about either).  

I'd only recommend India Palace if you happen to be driving along Twain during lunchtime."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian selection, great prices. Awesome buffet, very friendly and hard working staff. Overall a great experience every time"}
{"text":"Had dinner at this nice restaurant again last night. Every time I visit Vegas I make a point to eat here. Best food, Best Drinks, Best Service. Food quality is always the same and very tasty, servers are very courteous and prices are very reasonable for Vegas."}
{"text":"Authentic food and great service, a go to Indian getaway from the strip! Not as full for an early dinner, full menu and about 2 miles from the strip!"}
{"text":"Very good chicken biryani, and pleasant service.  Restaurant is very nice and well kept, but in a sketchy area of town."}
{"text":"For the price, and total satisfaction with the meal I give this restaurant a 5. We stopped in while doing laundry at laundry mat next door. Price is reasonable, service was good, food was very flavorful. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"Free Mango Lassi on check-in was really tasty & not too sweet. Both our entrees, Biryani & Tikka Masala, were excellent. Although the next table had Tandoori Chicken on a sizzling skillet and this looked even better than ours. This was the 4th Indian place we've tried in Las Vegas and definitely the best. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Last Sunday I took a friend from Oregon to India Palace.  I've been there many times and each time is as good or better than the last.  The renovations make it quite lovely inside -- used to be pretty drab.  We had the buffet and I had honestly forgotten how much it cost so was pretty surprised to get the bill:  under $25 for two!!  

The rogan josh is out-of-this world, but everything on the buffet is delicious.  The flavors are wonderfully blended and some of the dishes are moderately spicy but not hot-hot.  The naan is included which, as you may know, can add quite a bit to the cost of your meal if you order from the menu.  

I've been to several other Indian restaurants in Las Vegas and India Palace has never disappointed.  My friend was suitably impressed and is looking forward to going there again on her next visit.  And am I being anti-PC to say that we were the only non-Indians in the restaurant that afternoon?  That speaks well of the place.  OH -- and if you have an Entertainment book, there is a coupon although it's not good for the buffet, but at $11.99, who needs a coupon?"}
{"text":"We showed up in a large group and they were awesome. The customer service was second only to the food. OMG, the food was excellent!
Please stop in of you get the chance. Great place for Indian food with great service!"}
{"text":"My jam! We've been coming to India Palace for the past 9 years, and though we've tried two other Indian restaurants in town closer to where we live, we always come back and make that 20 minute drive because it is the best. Service wise (meaning the \"friendliness\" of the servers) is hit or miss, but that is me being nit picky. They always bring us what we need, we never have to wait for drink or naan refills, and I come for the food - not the the smiles! I recommend this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"This is best Indian food in Phoenix. Period! The house specials are my favorite. Don't forget the naan"}
{"text":"This place offers the best Indian food I have tried in Phoenix. Food is always fresh, service is top notch, naan is made fresh to order with your choice of garlic or regular and the buffet price is great at 8.99! They have good options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. We have been coming here for the buffet at least once a month since we first discovered India Palace a few years ago."}
{"text":"One of the best in Vegas. Food is tasty and service is good. With groupon deal you can get the best food at minimal price. We order kadai chicken, tandoori and mango lassi."}
{"text":"Went for dinner rather than the lunch buffet.  Service was a little slow but they were pretty busy (Valentine's Day) so it made sense.  The lamb curry and chicken vindaloo were very good.  The basmati rice was delicious.  Both the garlic and plain naan were excellent.  The portions are large.  One entree and one rice dish would have been plenty for two.  Otherwise, there's enough left to take home for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"The chicken masala and chicken curry were both good.  I was surprised that everything costs extra: naan, rice, sauce, etc.  It was good, but ended up being over $50 for two."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Indian restaurant. The food is excellent, the portions are quite generous without being excessive, and the service is attentive and usually pretty fast."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken korma and lamb biryani. I got a great groupon dinner deal for 4. India Palace has authentic delicious cuisine! I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We have known of this place for decades and have never been disappointed. The chicken tikka marsala is the best we have ever had. Paired with cheese naan and peas palau makes this a craving one must delve into regularly.  Also enjoy the vegetable pekora. 

We enjoyed the eight dollar coupon found on the Yelp site. The restaurant has been updated and the staff is friendly and courteous. 

Although the neighborhood can feel a little rundown, the overall experience is still very good and the parking lot has easy access to the restaurant. 

We have also had the buffet and it is very good if the chicken dish mentioned above is not your thing.

Mint sauce is soooo good. We will be back again next month for the regular fix."}
{"text":"This place is consitient and always a good meal.  For me its a \"standby\".  If we can't think of anyplace else o go, this is a place we know we can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Though I will say I always get the same chicken tandoori (spelling?  Don't worry, they'll know what you're talking about).  Plan on drinking a lot of water if you order it hot!"}
{"text":"We eat here for dinner every time we visit Las Vegas.  The food is always excellent."}
{"text":"I was very excited to order from here.  I am giving a low rating because of the service used to deliver my food.  AzMealMan.  I ordered my meal and it was delivered; after the girl left I noticed that I was missing a dish and there were no eating utensils or napkins.  I immediately called Azmealman...already closed.  I left a voicemail and I even wrote on the facebook page.  They responded on the fb page by telling me to call...which I already had!!!  I called again tonight.  Nothing yet.  OH...and now they don't allow comments on their fb page.  So.  Two things....missing dish, no eating utensils, no follow up, no facebook posts/comments from public...thumbs down.  AS for the food I did get...it was ok.  RIce with peans/nuts was generous and tasted good,, tandoori mixed plate was good...and there was alot of it.  The naan was not worth $1.50 at all.  In fact...it wasn't worth the $41 at all.  I might try it again by actually GOING to the buffet...perhaps I can recoup some of my losses then."}
{"text":"I loved your curry and great service! Curry was just right. I loved it. Great location. Loved the experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Authentic India food, then this is the place you want to eat. I had a great experience dining in, as not only you get excellent Indian food but the restaurant has great staff and a beautiful décor. Everything served at this restaurant is extremely fresh and hits all your taste buds. I recommend having chicken tikka masala, mix grille platter, palak paneer or paneer masala. Ive been to other Indian resturants in phoenix area, but the service, food and the whole dine in experience at this place exceeds any other in competition. I give this restaurant a 10 out of 10 for great service and food."}
{"text":"I'd like to consider myself a regular although I only visit this restaurant four weeks out of the year, which is whenever I'm in town for work. This is where I come when I'm craving my mom's homemade Indian food as this is the best place for North Indian food in Las Vegas.

Las Vegas has several options, but if you're craving fresh North Indian food, this is your spot. It used to be a hole in the wall years ago, and a bit less pricey, but they've stepped up their decor big time and have a small but classy bar setup now. They expanded their seating space as well, allowing for large groups; call ahead and request one of their private rooms that can be curtained off (I would estimate it seats between 6-12 guests, depending on the room).

You'll smell your usual Indian spices in the air, making you hungry. Worry not though, while waiting for your food you have both the papad they serve complimentary and Indian music videos playing on a pair of flat screens.

And when the food comes out, you will have no regrets no matter the choice. All around great food served in large portions. Of the 100 times I have been here, I have only literally had one bad experience. That's awesome.

Average vegetarian dish costs $13. Compared to other Indian spots in town (especially Tamba), this is a great deal for much better quality food. It's worth the trek from the strip!"}
{"text":"If your looking to get your fix of delicious Indian food please look no further. Their chicken is so tender and sauces are an amazing combination to satisfy your palate. I can't speak highly enough of the level of service and attentiveness as well. They made sure we had enough of everything for a perfect leftover meal also. I live in Chandler and will be making the drive to visit this place again and again."}
{"text":"Incredible food,  service and atmosphere.  I've been to a lot of Indian buffets and this was one of the best I've ever been to, the food was all very flavorful.  Very small and quaint place,  so don't expect a big huge flashy Vegas sign for it."}
{"text":"Went here to support a friend's event and stayed for dinner. The staff was very customer oriented and kept our glasses of water full and were checking in on a regular basis. I tried the bhel puri/chana chat which is chick peas, puffed rice, onions, and potatoes tossed in a tangy tamarind sauce. This was very fresh. My friend tried the fish tikka which was also very good.
I also tried:
dal makhani-pretty good
malai kofta-yummy
bhindi masala-it was good but very oily 
naan-both the garlic and plain naan very light and good
gulab jamun-yummy. this was very fluffy(not how gulab jamuns usually are so this was a pleasant change)
I was told that the chilli chicken was good too.

I would go and check this place out again!"}
{"text":"They have a fabulous 8.95 lunch buffet. The food was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Food was great! Our server Garry was great too! The manager was professional..he honored my yelp checkin free mango lassi (which was yummy) and yelp's $20 for $30 deal too without any hesitation. We were a group of four for dinner and it turned out to be $44 total including the above discounts, tip and taxes. Would love to go again!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food at a great price! If you are feeling overwhelmed by the strip and are looking for a quiet and delicious dining option go here! Everything on the menu is soo good and the wait staff are attentive and grateful. Constant thank yous even when you are being waited on. Garry is especially kind and knowledgable, if you put your order in his hands he will make sure you are happy.
So what are you waiting for go eat here now!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the lunch buffet here since the late '90's, which was two locations ago. They were by far my favorite Indian restaurant. I still really enjoy the lunch buffet occasionally, despite the fact that I now have to drive over 20 miles to get to it, but I must say both the food and the service have become really erratic. Sometimes they are great, sometimes they are not-so-great. Let me point out, first of all, that like all styles of food, tastes vary, and with Indian food taste will depend a lot on how spicy you like it. When ordering off the menu you can specify how spicy you want a dish. For the buffet, theirs is generally on the low-moderately spicy side, a good choice I think when you are serving a single dish to many palates. It certainly suits mine. But I have found that since they moved to the current location there are times when there is clearly a different cook with a different philosophy and that the buffet dishes are so spicy I personally can't stand to eat them. Sometimes they are the old familiar recipes I've been enjoying for 15 years, sometimes not. There a ground lamb dish that is one of the standards on the buffet. It used to be a ground lamb dish with onions and peas. Now it is an onion dish with peas and a little ground lamb. I nearly always order a beverage; I always need a refill. Sometimes I get it, sometimes no one ever comes around to even be flagged down and asked for one. I always want my water refilled, as well. Again, sometimes it happens, sometimes not. I don't know what has gone on since the move to the current location, but although I find at least one or two familiar faces every time I go there neither the service nor the food has any kind of consistency anymore, and while I love this place when the service is good and the food is from the recipes I like, I never know when that will be my experience or whether, when I go here, it will be one of the times when neither the food nor the service are anything to recommend. In other words, I think the wide range of reviews here are partly due to differences in preferences for spiciness and partly due to inconsistency in the restaurant itself - some times when I visit it is definitely a 5, sometimes it's a 2. I still go here occasionally, but when it was consistently good I went at least twice a month despite the 20 mile drive. If you live in the area, I'd say don't let one bad experience keep you from going back - it isn't always bad!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, authentic indian food and very very courteous staff makes this one of my fav indian restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch buffet and we were in love! Wonderful food, a nice selection of meat and vegetarian dishes and awesome service. 10$ for the lunch buffet which includes naan and chai tea. The last time I had Korma this good was a home cooked one! I will be coming back for it a dinner soon."}
{"text":"We ventured into this neighborhood trying to get some neat food on a cold night. Since it was our first night in vegas and we dint know this side of the city very well we ended up coming in the wrong side out from our hotel and i must say the route was super scary to walk by. I barely thought of how could any restaurant be tucked in this neighbourhood. Once we went in we were seated and we ordered malai kofta ( very enriching taste) and korma with naan. The food was overall very good. The service was not exactly great or worth mentioning but the power of food overpowered the service and hence the solid four stars."}
{"text":"Very tasty food specially the chicken kadai and naan is the best amongst other places around.
Papad is served complimentary. The Naan was super soft and i am still missing it though tried it a week back."}
{"text":"These guys are really mean and rude. Every time I place a order they either take forever, ignore order or just give me food with no condiments. When I call them I try to be polite as I can but I always get a major attitude and it's as if they don't want regular customers. This will be the last time I ever order from this place...

Update:  Do not ever order from these people. They are shady, flakey and extremely rude!!!"}
{"text":"We came here based on the reviews and we weren't disappointed. I was a little worried at first because the buffet wasn't that large, but I shouldn't have worried. When I first sat down, they brought water and naan right away. The people there were so nice and service was great. I tried almost everything on the buffet. My favorite was a smoked chicken that I can't remember the name of, but it was so good. Everything was so flavorable. This was our first visit but not the last."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations, but we were disappointed. They didn't have any of the south indian items on their menu (dosas). The biryanis were ok and were made out of a different type of rice (not basmati) so it wasn't what we expected. The curries were salty and were not big portions. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Disgusting food and service. We went at 10 Pm in the night and staff was in a hurry to close the restaurant. Ordered Biryani and few veg items but none of them were good. Ordered spicy biryani but I couldn't taste the flavor of the biryani as it was literally made with chili powder and very expensive too.I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews about places, but after eating at this delicious restaurant, I couldn't resist! Not only was the food served fast, and full of flavor, but was probably the best Indian food I have ever had ( and I have had a lot of Indian food in many different states across the U.S.) Our waiter, Vick, was extremely kind, attentive, and he went out of his way to make us feel welcomed. Hands down, he is probably one of the best waiters I have ever experienced. During our stay in Las Vegas, we went to many high end restaurants, but we enjoyed the food and service at India Palace the best. Wish we discovered this jewel years ago. I'm glad we stumbled upon it while on this trip."}
{"text":"Food tasted good. We had biryani, it was okay. Service could be better and reception could be better. Since we entered at almost closing time, I don't blame them. Service is a bit slower than what we expected."}
{"text":"the food was relatviely good for an Indian Buffet.  I however ordered from teh menu and after waiting 20 minutes i was told my selection was not available.  My daughter and son in law ate and i ordered another meal.  Unfortunately the service was very poor.  We even witnessed the waiter telling the table next to us he had no menus and when i had to order again they asked to see the menu and he told them NO.  Who turns down service in this economy.  As my grandaughter was getting fussy, I asked him to wrap my order and asked for sauces for the Nann bread  and i checked before leaving - they were not there.  A real disappointment"}
{"text":"Nice place. Seven buffet for lunch however we were there for dinner. Ordered to entrees both were very made. 
Best Indian restaurant on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Dinner specials are the best bang for your buck! Located near the back of the menu you can spend $20-$25 and get naan, choice of soup, entree, two sides, basmati rice and a refreshing mango dessert (almost like a thicker mango lassi)

Service is quick and food is delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered a malai kofta vegetarian curry and tandoori roti along with dosa. The curry was unlike the typical orange colored curries you get at many places here in USA. It was very tasty. The roti was soft and the dosa and Sambhar also good. Overall, a good restaurant."}
{"text":"We constantly keep coming back to this place because it so warm and welcoming! We love the food and the atmosphere. Despite in the midst of the renovation,  it is our favorite please to eat. Added bonus, Bollywood music videos! Excellent touch!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick to-go order for lunch on our last day at vegas before driving to airport....got vegetable Biryani.....and that was awesome, wish we had known about this place earlier, would have definitely tried the buffet and other  dishes. the dinning area looked good and the hosts were very warm too. Would surely visit whenever in vegas the next time."}
{"text":"Decor-  Pretty cheap and ugly.  Bathrooms were a bit iffy.

Service- mmm, pretty much took forever, though they were nice enough.  

Food- Pretty standard, but decent Indian food.  Nothing out of the ordinary.

Price- Normal, not a + or - either way.

I considered giving it a one mostly because my friends and I were tricked into going in here.  Standing on the street trying to decide which restaurant to go to, a would-be \"passer by\" told us that India Palace was superior.  So we went in.  After about 30 minutes of eating there we saw the same person, who turned out to be an employee or owner.  Not cool.

I'd probably try the place next door next time."}
{"text":"First time trying with a friend who had never had Indian before. Honestly, I was not impressed. We went to the buffet right after they opened and I was very underwhelmed... The flavors were bland... No chicken tikka masala (I know it's not guaranteed... But it's a staple). So we ordered it for 12.99 additionally... Not impressed. It may be a regional thing... But the best tikka masala I've ever had was really creamy and full of flavor... This was less creamy and more sweet tangy with an off flavor... Oh! And the pakora was so chewy... No crunch at all. 

I've had better in the valley... Maybe it's an off day for both of us, but I wouldn't come back.


**to be fair... I came in with an expectation... And it was not met... Service was great and their were some good dishes. The chicken and lamb curry were yummy... as well as the naan."}
{"text":"We have been twice to this place!! By far one of the best Indian Restaurants I have eaten at. We come to vegas every year for a convention and the last two years we have made a point to eat here... It is always a highlight of our trip!! Ask for Vick when you visit, he is the best."}
{"text":"I'd say the food was very good and the service was excellent. They had two yelp deals going and we were able to use both of them with no problem. The chicken masala was very good, though a little on the salty side, and the chicken sagwala was also good but could have used a little more flavor. The mango lassi and paratha were both top notch. That said, neither of us were disappointed and I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Wonderful tastes! Disappointed that buffet is only lunch. We got the eggplant dish, potato dish, veggie rice. Too much for us, so we took it with us. Don't want to miss out on the scrumdilumtious food. We will be back."}
{"text":"I am a pretty good judge of Indian food and this is probably the best Indian food in the valley.  I really like the restaurant decor which is unusual as Indian restaurants usually have awful looks to them.  The food is delish.  They even served Mango chutney without charge-love.  I personally get the butter chicken and lamb biriani and really really liked it.  The service is great when we go on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Interesting place. We brought a restaurant.com coupon and there were three of us. Service was... interesting. While I like attentive servers, this guy was a little TOO attentive. It was almost like he was another dinner guest, he was always at our table. We appreciated the suggestions he gave us for starters but it felt a little pushy and too much like an upsell. The Shahi Paneer was pretty good (that's my standard order, some kind of paneer). The kulfi was good, but not as good as Mint. I may come back but there are a lot of great Indian places much closer to me, so maybe not."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Las Vegas!  We finally got a chance to try India Palace, and it did not disappoint!  For appetizers we had the veggie samosas and the onion kulcha.  The samosas were fantastic, the onion kulcha very good but I would probably try something else next time. We had chicken tikka masala and matar mushroom for entrees, both were scrumptious.  
   The food was on the spicy side in general, which we love.  Funniest part of the evening was after we'd been munching on the papadums with various sauces, one of the sauces was extremely spicy, and we told the waitress/hostess we'd like to have our entrees just as spicy.  She looked at us and said \"You're white, right??\"  I almost fell off my chair!  Apparently most Caucasians don't request their food spicy, all the better for us.   
     Everything was reasonably priced and evocative of the fantastic Indian restaurant we'd left behind when we moved here from New Jersey.  This is THE best Indian in Vegas, hands down."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is so fresh and cooked to perfection. It's difficult to find good Indian food in Las Vegas, so this restaurant is quite a gem. Our waiter, Manny, was just wonderful, very attentive and helpful. Also, the coffee was fantastic."}
{"text":"I tried this place back in July while on vacation. It was a pit pricey but the food was absolutely delicious. Some of our favorites were the chicken masala and the chicken tandoori. The garlic naan bread was really good. We tried a lot and everything was good. Now the service was amazing! Our waiter was attentive and nice! The decor is great because it doesn't look cheap! The inside of the restaurant is nice. The parking isn't very large."}
{"text":"I come here for a great lunch two or three times a week! Especially reliable is the saag, mutter paneer, peas and mushrooms in butter sauce, and the spinach pekora. The biryani and tandoori are always perfect, and the lamb curry is a nice treat, tender and spicy. 

Try the yummy chai on tap, too!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to enough Indian restaurants to compare, but everytime I've been here, the food was excellent, the service was amazing, and the mango lassi..... MMMMHMMMM. 

No complaints! The waiters are very attentive & friendly..personable. I ordered a dal soup not really knowing what to expect, and they brought out both a tomato soup & the dal (lentil) soup for me to decide which I liked better! I really enjoyed the dal soup (delicious) but I liked the tomato soup too. Definitely not your typical American tomato soup. It's got flaaaava flaaav! 

I always want to try something new, but seem to end up ordering the same things... One day I will though, considering I'm here all the time!"}
{"text":"Ewwwwwww, so disappointed!!!  DO NOT EAT HERE! I truely think it is a heath hazard.  My wife and I were excited to try India Palace since we have not found a good Indian restaurant in AZ yet.  We read the great reviews on Yelp and went in expecting to have a new favorite.  We ordered the Somosas as an appatizer and they came out cold, almost frozen in the middle.  We had to ask for new ones, which came out steaming hot.  Problem sovled right?  Wrong.  Next we had the chicken tikka masala, chana masala, rice and riata (yogurt dip).  I was the first to find a hair in my rice and then a minute later my wife pulled a 6-7 inch dark hair off of her fork TOO!!!  The Chana Masala was bland, needed salt and the Chicken Tikka Masala only had about 8 small pieces of chicken, for $10!!  To top it all off, I used the restroom to wash my hands and they had no soap in the dispenser, only a dirty bottle of softsoap sitting on top of the dispenser.  Safe to say, we will not go back.  Even with the $1.50 yogurt sauce being comped due to the cold somosas, wouldnt you comp the problem item not the least expensive??  :("}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for delicious Indian food. They have amazing sauces and tons of options. One dish I have never encountered at any other place is malai kofta. These are a veggie meatball in a yellow sauce. I feel it's important to mention that I am not a vegetarian. These things are amazing, I order them every time I go. Whether you eat meat or veggies I highly recommend you give this a try. In addition the service is great. The staff are always helpful and courteous. As a bonus they play great Indian soap operas that are fascinating. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because I do feel the biriyani could improve."}
{"text":"I went to India palace for lunch buffet. They had very few choices and the food was just okay."}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner after reading the reviews.  When we walked in the door, most of the customers were Indians so we knew the food was authentic.  I ordered Chicken Korma and my husband had the Lamb Vindaloo and both were exceptional.  The TV was playing Indian music videos but at a low volume so it was a nice addition to the atmosphere.  Service was excellent as well.  

We returned for the luncheon buffet later in the week.  There were a number of vegetarian dishes as well as chicken, lamb, beef and goat dishes in a variety of sauces.  I especially liked the vegetable pakoras and the sag paneer was some of the best we've had (and I normally don't like vegetables)  The garlic naan was great too.  I normally don't like rice pudding but their's was creamier and the rice very soft, small grains.  We will definitely be visiting Indian Palace on any future trips to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! We had the chicken misala, butter chicken, and beef curry. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Dang. This was exactly what the West Valley needed. It is well priced, food was good, and service was very much on point. They visited our table constantly to refill drinks, and food was pretty good.

The Tandoori chicken was a bit smokier than I'm used too, and the smoke tasted slightly artificial, but everything else was delicious and as expected. 

The chai on the buffet was a really nice touch, and helped break up my normal water and lemon.

And 8.99 for a weekend lunch buffet? You don't see that much anymore."}
{"text":"I'm so glad India Palace is still here! One of my favorites from back in the college days! Better than I remember it.

I enjoy the unique location in older Vegas, and the India version of MTV was entertaining! Better than our MTV!

The servers were very attentive and always smiling. Forgot the servers name but he was charming, with a genuine smile and longest lashes ever! I made sure to let him know how envious I was. He offered a beer from India for ua to try, but I has to kindly refuse . I asked him what was better to try, the mango lassi or shake. He recommended the lassi with such confidence, I knew I was going to enjoy it..:) it is basically fresh mango purée with yoghurt as the base, somewhat of a milkshake, but with a definate yoghurt taste. I enjoyed it very much and wish I could buy it at the store

We started with the flat breads and chutneys..an Indian version of chips and salsa,!! 
We had ordered the vegetarian samosas, lamb curry, aloo gabi and the fragrant rice! Oh and the garlic naan was so goooodddd!

No wonder this place can survive after all these years, the food is excellent, and servers genuine and attentive!! I hope to keep coming here!!!!

Thank You India Palace!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  We had the pompedoro, chicken tikka, chicken tikka masala and beef korma.  All the meat was delicious and tender and the naan was excellent too.  Great service!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place! 

Our server, Manny, was extremely attentive and kind. 

For dinner, I had the lamb tikka masala which I will definitely be craving from now on!! The peas pulao were also delicious, and I think the naan was the best I've ever had. My friends' said they really enjoyed their dishes too. For dessert, we got the Gulab Jamun, and my friend said it was just liker her mother makes it, which is hard to find. I had never had it before, but I enjoye it -- kind of like a light doughnut hole floating in a honey sauce that wasn't overly sweet. I am a big fan of India Palace and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't had the pleasure of sitting in but have ordered food to go from this place. It's become a reliable \"order out\" restaurant in my book (considering the many places we've tried so far) 

I always order Chicken Tikka Masala along wtih Basmati Rice and Plain Naan (What can I say? It's my favorite and what I use as a comparison for Indian restaurants) Their Vegetable Biryani and Garlic Naan are also worth considering although the garlic naan may be too flavorful."}
{"text":"Very nice place enjoy the food Joy the company staff was amazing I'm very happy with the food quality awesome job"}
{"text":"I asked for pappadum as I sat down and got them with my water. However, I waited and waited and waited for someone to take my order. Keep in mind there were more waiters than seated tables.  Still waiting as I'm writing this, waiters just keep walking by. Finally someone noticed me, wow, that took a while! Make sure you flag someone down when you're ready to order. I ordered chicken seekh kabab and chicken tikka masala with chili peppers added. I get this dish in London (tikka chili masala) but can't find it in the US. Well, they just screwed up the check of table next to me twice. Uh-oh, getting more nervous about the food. The food just arrived.  The tikka masala was great, the seekh kabobs were ok but not exactly spiced right. Tikka gets 4 stars and seekh 3.5 stars. One of the waiters came by my table and asked me what I thought about the Indian food in England vs. the Indian food in the US.  He also asked me what could be added to the menu or if there were any changes I recommended.  He seemed geniunely concerned with my opinion of the restaurant.  Don't get turned away because of my 3 star rating it was mainly service related. I would come back!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. Most of the items are ok how ever they don't have many options in desserts. Please don't try the \"IDLY\" here."}
{"text":"On our trip to Vegas over the holidays I search for some good food. This place popped up and it turned out to be some of the best indian I have every had. The Naan was so soft, warm, and flavorful....the best. We had spicy yet it was the perfect spice for us. Not too much that you could not taste the flavor, but still with a kick. The restaurant was very nice and the staff were very attentive. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Another day, another Indian buffet.

It's Friday, which is Go Out To Somewhere Besides Subway day. 

Dining companions: \"Let's go to India Palace!\"

Me: \"Is it sit down or a buffet?\"

Dining companions: \"Buffet.\"

Me: \"I don't know then. Maybe I'll go somewhere else.\"

Dining companions: \"But it's much better than the other places! We promise!\"

Me: \"I don't know, man.\"

Dining companions: \"You will like it. We are not joking.\" 

Me: \"Dudes, I'm not so sure about this, but hey, what the hell. I'm in.\"

So alright, walking into this restaurant, India Palace surprisingly seems to have the interior done pretty nicely. Nice chairs. Pointed archways. Water set on tables in tall glass bottles. Music playing but not loud and not cloying. All that stuff.

The lunch buffet ($8.95) has all the standard dishes, but definitely more variety than either Maharaja, Flavors of India, or Taste of India. The food tasted pretty decent, although the buffet garlic naan was pretty flimsy. Tandoori chicken was a disappointment, but I've never had good buffet tandoori chicken in an Indian restaurant EVER, and the veggie biryani was not really a biryani, but again it's a buffet, so I'll just let it slide, since the other dishes, like the keema (ground lamb) and aloo mattar (potatoes and peas) were good. 

I never went to India Palace's old location on Greenway, so this was all a new experience for me. Again, pleasant place to sit in, spotless bathrooms (big indicator when it comes to these places), and decent buffet food. May come back again, but may head back to Tandoori Times 2 for better grilled meat options and naan made the way it's meant to be.

3.43 stars for now. Good effort."}
{"text":"I'm upset that I have to even leave 1 star because my experience doesn't even merit that. But I was incredibly disappointed by my visit. The reviews were great and I was excited to experience the buffet. It took me all morning to decide if I wanted to go to my normal Tandoori Times 2 or if I wanted to try this place. Well the reviews were great so I made my decision. Unfortunately it was a bad one. 

My son and I arrived for lunch. We were greeted and shown to sit at a booth. We sat down and waited... and waited... and waited. We waited approximately 15 minutes while we watched the staff not help us. No water, no service, nothing. I wasn't exactly sure if we were supposed to just go to help ourselves at the buffet so I waited and observed another table that just arrived and was seated. Nope sure enough they were given water and menus!  I was astonished that we were completely forgotten so we just walked out. 

Normally I would say to give a second chance. You never know what the true circumstances are. But how can you after being completely ignored and forgotten?!  I really don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Great food here! I enjoyed the Lamb Korma and of course a cup of Mango Lassi. This place is a good place for groups. They also have a lunch buffet 7 days a week. Oh, and great customer service!"}
{"text":"There's lots of coupons floating around the web for this restaurant, so there's no reason to pay full price, but even if you do end up paying full price, the cost is reasonable.  They have a large menu featuring many vegetarian dishes, chicken, lamb, goat, and other traditional Indian foods.  Their lamb menu is extensive, and being a huge fan of lamb, I get some variety of lamb every time I come here.  I haven't eaten a single thing here that I didn't like. Their naan is to die for, particularly the garlic naan.
I wasn't a big fan of their buffet.  It was small and there weren't very many spicy dishes. However, for those nervous about trying Indian food for the first time, the buffet menu offers a variety of mild, common indian dishes (they also serve you a plate of naan).
I would say This is one of the best Indian places in town at this price range."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places! The buffet during lunch is the best deal for the money since sometimes the full menu can get a bit pricey. It is always fresh and stocked; my personal favorite is the saag and my husband loves their lamb."}
{"text":"I had the worst service today at the resturant. The worst service I have ever countered came from Vick, very unprofessional and unfriendly individual. The food took a long time to get prepared and his behavior is immature.
Given all these facts I will never set foot in that resturant again. If you care about the service and great food then this is not the place for you. Respect is what you need to get customers."}
{"text":"Went here for a family lunch, we decided to go with the buffet because of the variety of selection that they offered. My favorite were:
- roasted broccoli: simple and sweet. 
- veggie korma: very flavorful I like the cauliflower peas and cheese. 
- potatoes and cabbage: very flavorful and not too over powering. 

It also comes with naan, refillable unsweetened chai tea and a selection of dessert (gulab jaman, fruits, rice milk). 

I didn't try, but they also offered chicken tikka masala, ground lamb and lamb korma! 

Overall a flavorful and quick stop for the whole family!"}
{"text":"The service staff here is also not good, the waiters are always in a rush to get the check even though there are not much customers. Overall, in a hope to find Indian food you go in and get disappointed."}
{"text":"Every Indian in Las Vegas eats here. If you're not Indian and you want to eat where the Indians eat, this is it. It's the Bomb. and I don't mean Bay.

Everyplace else is like the toilet that kid hid in in the movie Slumdog compared to this."}
{"text":"Great buffet selection here. One of the better Indian food in desert."}
{"text":"We decided on a whim to dine here after ordering take-out the other week. My husband chatted with the owners and found they were from England, which they both had in common, and they seemed keen to have our repeat business. Translate: they know the English penchant for a weekly curry and they wanted us to become regulars. And I sooo wanted to, I really did. But Alas. Compared to other Indian restaurants we have been to, in England in particular, the flavors were just ok. The decor was better than your average strip mall location and was very clean inside. The servers tonight lacked quite a bit in the attentiveness department. On the one hand, they were quick to bring pappadams and an assortment of the usual dipping sauces, and the main entrees we ordered were delivered quickly, however waters were left empty and we had to remind the servers of a couple things we had requested such as eh-hem our Taj Majal. My advice, never stand between a man (my husband) and his beer, particularly when you are offering up some spicy dishes. All in all it was a good meal but certainly not my best nor most memorable Indian meal."}
{"text":"Garry our waiter was great.  Authentic karahi goat dish, lamb roganjosh was fantastic, chicken tikka  was great also. Fresh naan bread yummy! Full bar!! It's clean and staff is friendly !!!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went to my usual Indian restaurant, Queen and Duncan.  It was hot outside and the A/C was not working.  Too hot to stay and enjoy.  So looked for another one.  Found India Palace.  First A/C working, clean and really nice food.  Best part was rice pudding.  Best I have ever had.  Not too sweet, really rich. Servers were really nice, brought me plenty of water without having to ask  I will be going there from now on."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. They have numerous vegetarian options and free chai. The food tasted great without being overly spicy. I almost had to eat at in n out and found this place only 1 exit away. It was at least as fast as fast food but significantly better food. I was very grateful to find this place!"}
{"text":"How's their food? Who knows, they wouldn't give us any. We were seated. The place didn't have many customers as the whole center of the restaurant was empty. Our order was taken, and then we waited. And waited. 50 minutes after being seated, a waitress came out with a tray and headed for us, but then turned and gave our order to another table, who started eating. We got up, tried to pay for our drinks, which was declined, and went down the street to \"Touch of Thai\" where we had our food 15 minutes after sitting down."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of co-workers and we all had the buffet.  The line was not too long and they had an ample selection of Indian food.  The Lamb Curry was rather tasty so I went back for seconds."}
{"text":"Not too bad of a place was a little worried when first went in and we are one of the only tables in the place at dinner time but about 40 minutes later the place started filling up so guess you eat late with Indian food but anyway start off with the mango lassi didn't really particularly like there's it was warm and had too much spices or something in it overpowered the drink I have that chicken Tandoori which is pretty good not the best I've ever had but still really good and they give you lots of onions and peppers under it so it's super feeling had the garlic Nam bread there's was okay my son had the lamb kebab I liked it and he thought it was the best I've had anywhere overall not too bad but does another place I like the little better and if she practicing to and services better but I would go back here it wasn't bad"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of this place ... wonderful, wonderful indian food.  I've eaten here four times in the last 2 months and each time everything's been terrific.  highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food but tried to use a restaurant.com certificate and they refused it. Nothing in the fine print said I could not use it tonight. Very shady!"}
{"text":"Heaven on earth if you like Indian food.
Been going here 5 years for lunch and dinner.
Buffet is super, ask for garlic naan.
Tandoori chicken is the best around.  They've been consistent in their food since I\"ve been coming here.  Not worried if the buffet is going to be cold (other Indian buffets I've had have been cold or cool, the food hasn't been completely heated)
INdia Palace is Amazing, fresh, yummy, a kaleidascope of flavors.  
These guys get 6 STARS.
The anise seeds at the bar/cash register is to aid in digestion and/or bad breath, and yes, it tastes like black licorice. It's very strong."}
{"text":"Two stars, mostly for a kindly wait staff and cleanliness.  The food, unfortunately, was terrible.  My chicken tikka masala tasted exactly like chicken tenders in bbq sauce.  My husband ordered spicy lamb vindaloo, \"I want to sweat!\" he told the waitress, and what he got had no discernible spice whatsoever.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Reviews for this place are really misleading.  We went there today, and we were very disappointed.  If you're looking for more authentic Indian food,  this is not the place.  We noticed that the chicken tikka was sweeter than usual, when we asked the chef if it had ketchup or bbq sauce, he mentioned that they did use some ketchup.  

We ordered 3 other dishes, biryani, lamb chili, and chicken karahi.  The biryani was not fresh - the chicken was sub-par, the lamb chili was OK - a little bland, and the chicken karahi was relatively the better dish of the night.  Again, there was only one other table that was occupied, so maybe they weren't prepared?

We went there because we were at an event where they catered food from there, and that catered food was much better than what we had at the restaurant.   

Not going back there."}
{"text":"Wonderful ! Our favorite Indian food in the valley. Lamb curry, lamb korma, peshwari naan, are just a few of our favorites. Lunch buffet is great also. Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"Vegas has a gazillion restaurants to choose from, so the list of places that I want to visit is quite extensive. I definitely knew that wanted to go to a place that would have more locals than tourists. After running through my list and seeing the great Yelp reviews, I finally decided on India Palace.

Wow, I was not disappointed! Started the meal off with the Vegetable Pakora and the Onion Bhaji. The Onion Bhaji, which are onions dipped in spicy batter and then deep fried, was amazing!!! It had the perfect amount of spiciness to start with, and when I felt like upping the spice meter, I just added a little of that really hot dipping sauce. I don't know the name of that sauce, but you know, the one that burns your mouth off.

I went for my usual Chicken Vindaloo for my main course. Chicken Vindaloo is chicken cooked in a hot spicy sauce with diced potatoes, and of course, you can request the level of spiciness. I went for \"hot\"! To die for... it was sooo good!!! It was so spicy that I started sweating while eating it....yeah, that's some good shit! I gobbled this down with some garlic naan and cheese naan, and was quite full. I didn't even have room for dessert, which is usually required in my book.

When I checked in, I unlocked a Yelp coupon code, which they pleasantly honored. The service was absolutely awesome! Nice, quick, and always a smile.

Will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is solid.. the food is good and a couple of hose Indian beers will lay u away. The key to enjoyment is the Tandoori Chicken Tika.. as hot as they will do it.. very very good.. butter chicken.. very good. nan. rockin..

The owner is cool.. and this place really hs great food. Get anything fish, lamb, fish .. tandoori.. it rocks.. enjoy!"}
{"text":"Still the best Indian restaurant in Vegas. Great food, great service. I've been going here since the past 8 years - and the quality of the food has remained the same which is a lot to say for a small restaurant. Must try, especially for their lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"This a detailed and direct to the point review about the place 

Service are really bad and people are not friendly. It seems that if you are not Indian then you are not welcomed there .

Place smell strong , I must say I unpleasant smell . I think they need to turn on there extracting system or replace it. .

I must I have been in many Indian Resturant in my life 

In the following countries 

1- United Kingdom where the Indian food popular as the Mexican food here in the date 
2- Germany where I come from .
3- Arab countries .
5- Spain
6- Belgium only once 

Never ever paid for their rice that come with the stew .
Actually most of the food is served with rice . If you would like to order extra rice then you must pay that extra .

The same with bread if it order Tindory ( Indian barbecue version)

Those guys ripped me off with both .

Now let us talk about food 
Although all what I mentioned about my negative experience the food was good. I would give them honestly for the food only 3 and half star. 

But sadly the whole night was destroyed by this in ethical and very cheap way of running business   . I don't think that everyone Indian place is like that at all. And I will keep going to the honest one . 

I will also adjust a picture from the recipe to support my review .

And one of the waiter was nice Out of 4 

Hope that my review will be helpful .

En español 
No es buena experiencia para nada , el lugar Huelva feo feo y tratan la venta muy mal . Mejor aprender indo antes de irte. Se tratan a los de ellos en otra maniera 

Italiano
Non andate questo posto. Non é limpido e anche trattano la gente come se erano insetti.  Veramente schifo .

Io sono esatto en mezzo mondo è mai sono trovato una esperienza così pessima .

Auf deutsch 

Bitte vergessen Sie einfach dieses sogenannte Resturant. Stinkt wie Pest .
Die Leute sind arrogant und sehr ungebildet .
Billige Geld Schweinerei und unehrliche Quittung .

Lieber in Casino Rio wo die Kontrolle unsere Deutsch Standard entspricht .

Português.  

Você não vá a acreditar que cheiro feio vá a encontrar neste restaurante 
Não recomendo a ninguém ir ali .

{"text":"First off this review is for the so-called 'Customer Service' here, so let me begin. 

My friend and I had been waiting all week to finally come to this spot to try Indian for the first time.  I had read all the great reviews about the Chicken Tikka Masala and how good the garlic naan was so we were pretty excited about it.

As we entered we weren't really greeted politely, we were kind of looked at like we were lost.  I asked the waiter if we could have a table for 2, so he pointed and said booth 3, so we walked to the nearest empty booth he was possibly referring to.  We sat for about a couple minutes till the same waiter came over and said \"you're here for the buffet right?\" We looked at each other confused because it was our first time there so I asked him if we were able to order from the menu, he looked annoyed and went over and grabbed a couple menus and brought them over.

My friend and I were already set on ordering ourselves the Chicken Tikka Masala because of the great reviews and the garlic naan as well. We waited a few more minutes then a different waiter approached us and asked us if we were here for the buffet.  I politely said no we are first timers and not too sure what was being served at the buffet.  He then described all the choices, I asked if the chicken tikka masala was available and he had said no, I also had asked if the garlic naan would be available at the buffet and he said no they would have to make it in the back and bring it out.  He was really trying to push us to eat at the buffet but we were really set on trying the dish we wanted.  So he took our order of 2 Chicken Tikka Masalas and the Garlic Naan.

I then asked about the free Mango Lassi you receive if you check in on yelp.  My friend and I both showed our check-ins, then he says that only one person per table with a coupon gets a free Mango Lassi (which was NOT stated on the coupon or app that it only applies for 1 person. SO if you're going with a friend or friends, be prepared that only ONE of you will get a free Mango Lassi if you check in here)

During the time while waiting for our order no one approaches us and let's us know our food will be ready soon, or to re-fill our water cups or to check in on us at all.  

Finally our food comes out and it's a pretty small bowl of the Chicken Tikka Masala, a few small pieces of boneless chicken submerged in like 5 ounces of their sauce and spices, but it smells delicious, then a basket of the naan which really wasn't much since we both shared two pieces each, and a bowl of rice to share between the both of us. (I thought per order of a dish you get your own rice, but I thought wrong.)

Food definitely 5 Stars.  Being a first timer I was satisfied, but for the price of 2 bowls of chicken tikka masala, sharing a bowl of rice and an order of garlic naan (which came out to be a little over $20 each) I'm disappointed.  Not too sure if he had charged us the dinner price and gave us a lunch size meal. 

All in all my friend and I both enjoyed the Flavors of Indian food for the first time, but will probably NEVER come back here again."}
{"text":"No one loves Indian food more than me! it's my chill grub when I want to just veg out and enjoy a good movie. The folks here at IP know how to do it best!

I had placed my order over the phone not knowing what to expect flavor-wise but following my motto of \"try something new every day!\" ... once I entered inside the restaurant was jam-packed which I took as a sign of great food!

Ricky greeted me, took down my name, asked if I had ever been there before and made me feel welcome. Although I was just ordering a variety of my fav appetizers he asked if I was using any of the discounts offered thru the app. I suggested that I'd save those for a larger order and he mentioned if I do use it in the future to ask for him for any additional discounts that can be offered!

Also, Ricky reminded me of my \"free mango lassi with check-in\" ... he was very prompt with their Yelp offerings and I appreciate that! After all that's how I found them. 

Quality and flavors of the food are easily 5 stars in my book! and I wouldn't hesitate to return in the future. 

The only downside is that the parking lot is small and there were a ton of taxi cabs picking up & dropping off. space is limited but once you taste the food you'll understand why. 

\"hole in the wall\" establishments always turn out to be the very best! Try it today."}
{"text":"We were a group of four n were very hungry travelling back from hoover dam to vegas.we were  in  search of good Indian food and after having buffet here we realized v made the best decission by choosing Indian palace...Food was very tasty n it's worth of the money ...Waiter Anthony took care of very well I would definitely recommend this.."}
{"text":"Their Lunch Buffet is nice, their North Indian dishes are really really good...Good Ambience.. 

The dosa is also nice but huge... Basic veggies like okra are just ok...but the paneer and cholle etc are really nice..."}
{"text":"I've eaten at most Indian places in town over the years. This by far has been the best quality and best tasting Indian food in Vegas. The atmosphere and service is great. They have a traditional menu but the only place in town that has goat curry which is amazing."}
{"text":"I've only been here for the lunch buffet, which is pretty reasonably priced.  The food is very good.  Selection is ample and the food is hot and fresh.

I do recommend the gulab jamun for dessert (milk dumplings in syrup), they are good here :)

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good food, good flavors on the veggie curries.  The paneer tikka appetizer is the best!"}
{"text":"Good food good service  :-) Will go back when I'm craving Indian food. It is buffet so you get rice and a bunch of toppings. They have a small salad selection and rice pudding with sweets. Staff were very attentive."}
{"text":"Perfect place for Indian food. Great service,affordable price nd amazing food. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great food!  Such great ambiance and I am a total India food foodie.  If you are looking for a great place to eat Indian food in Vegas...  THIS is your SPOT, because it hits the SPOT trust me!  You will be glad you ate here.  :-)"}
{"text":"After the long drive from longbeach,CA to las vegas in that horrible long weekend traffic, we managed to have a lot of fun in the sin city for the whole night just hanging around on the strip and at the random bars. It made 6 of us feel like kings until we decided to have lunch buffet at this place.
I ordered a \"plain lassi\" assuming it to be salted lassi and the old waiter assumed it to be sweet lassi and so i asked him to get me what i wanted. He came back really rude and said mean words while we had our food. My thank you was ignored and he made scronful faces instead. He got the check way before we were done with the lunch. And, eventually while we were leaving instead of a formal thank you, he passed mean comments. I was really offended. Such a bad experience after an amazing night.

****HORRIBLE SERVICE ****
****RUDE OLD STAFF****
****BLEND FOOD****
****WORST MENU****

There are much better indian buffet all over veags. I would never go back here."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon - $20 for 2 for dinner. EVERYTHING is ala carte. I think rice should be included at the price they ask for entrees. We had an eggplant dish and Chiken Tiki Masala. Neither of them were large portions, just adequate. I don't like any restaurant that charges for something that should be part of a main dish. The food was good, nothing amazing, we would not recommend going for dinner, go for the lunch buffet. Service was nice, décor nice as well, but there just isn't good value."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Tikka Masala EVER!   (Not including my kitchen.. psssh)  They also have great Vegetarian options.

I visit India Palace about once a week with one of my fave Londoners .  Now, if you know anything about people from London, you'd know that they know true Indian food.  She also happens to be Vegan and still loves this place.  

The Panner Tikka Masala is my favorite Vegetarian dish.  I almost prefer it over the Chicken Tikka because you really can't go wrong with cheese.  They also have killer naan.  I prefer the stuffed fruit and garlic.  You also can't beat the service.  They know me by name and always serve with a smile.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have ever had in America.  We ordered the goat & lamb dishes, garlic naan & this phenomenal rice dish. The waiter was very nice & helped us place our order. We wanted to try something new yet more traditional. The setting was quiet & comfortable.  Don't let the neighborhood scare you, this is a must have. This will be a place we will always come back to when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for over 10 years. I am an Indian who is very passionate about my food.  Each time I visit India palace, food and service always exceeds expectations.  Our top favorite items on the menu are chicken tikka masala, paneer tikka, bhindi masala and malai kofta.  The staff is very polite and go out of their way to give you best possible service. Today our server was Gary. I forgot my gift card in the restaurant and he ran out to the parking lot in the cold weather, looking for us and handed me my gift card which still had a balance of $40!!! Thank you Gary and thank you India palace for taking care of my Indian food cravings for all these years! You are the best."}
{"text":"I don't know how people gave 4stars to this restaurant. We went this place after seeing good reviews on yelp. But it turned out ordinary than ordinary. We ordered masala dosa, uttapam , chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani. Dosa and it's stuffing potato sabzi had no taste at all. I never tasted chicken tikka masala this much sour.we asked them to make chicken biryani spicy but oh boy it was so spicy we couldn't eat more than two bites. Chicken was undercooked. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian Food in Vegas, beautiful decor. Full bar. There is definitely a master spicer behind the kichen door. WOW!"}
{"text":"There were 12 of us that ate at this crowded and cramped place, with stinky overflowing restrooms in Las Vegas. 
The food was delicious. Some dishes could be less greased with butter, but overall the food was good in comparison to mid-range Indian restaurants in the US - although it was priced higher than most in its range. 
The wait was long as there are few tables to seat. Restrooms were absolutely a disaster with things overflowing with no attention from the owners. A common problem with most Indian restaurants like this one. If the food is good, the price is high - but no funds are diverted to keeping the restaurant clean for a clean experience. Where does all the cash go - not to the poor low-cost undocumented workers ????"}
{"text":"So sad to report that my favorite indian place has declined to the point where I will NOT be returning.  This was my all time favorite place and my husband drove the 19 miles to get there because we could count on a good meal.  I think a good restaurant is worth the drive.  Unfortunately, I will not be returning.  Can any Yelper recommend a good indian restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale area?  I don't mind driving."}
{"text":"I can't say I'm an expert on Indian cuisine but this is my fav spot in Las Vegas. I know the location is questionable at best but the food is worth it. Best Naan in town. Saag Paneer, Chicken Tiki Masala and Vegetable Korma are great. Lunch buffet is $10 but it's a great way to try an assortment of what they have to offer. The place is small but it adds to the ambiance."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this hole in the wall, for sure. The dining room and service are nice, and the buffet has a pretty good selection, but if you're getting takeout, be forewarned.

For takeout, I'd give this spot between 2-3 stars. Portions are small for the price and protein is minimal. Our $16 goat curry had a scant amount of meat and I found only four small chunks of cheese in my saag paneer. But the tandoori wings are amazing, with grilled peppers and onions, with lemon. But to spend just under $50 with tip for takeout for two? It's not great.

The buffet is their best deal. Good selection, variety of vegetarian options as well as multiple meat (lamb, goat, chicken) options. Service is attentive and friendly. Naan is included. There's even a small bar area and they appear to have beer and wine. I'm pretty sure you can rent this spot out for special events.

Averaging my experiences together, I can't rave but it's kind of a gem for this neighborhood. Snag a Groupon while they're still up and you can save a bit on dine-in (not valid for buffets) or takeout (minimal discount)."}
{"text":"Sooo good. We had the chicken masala,  naan, and karahi lamb. The food was delicious, owners were nice, and prices were great. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The butter Chicken ,Chicken tikki marsala , and Karahi Lamb all are out of this world. Garlic naan is fresh and perfect. This place has excellent food and great service. Authentic atmosphere."}
{"text":"We ordered a la carte for lunch. The paneer tikka masala and dal makhani was just perfect taste. Loved the service. Also the garlic naan was as crisp as needed. The could improve on the South Indian dishes."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant off the strip in Las Vegas. We've been going here a few years now and have never been disappointed. Naan is always perfectly cooked and served piping hot. Onion Bahji and vegetable pakora are very well prepared.  The chutney's should come in buckets as we could not get enough of these.  So yummy. Chicken tikka masala was spiced perfectly and the chicken was moist and tasty. We'll continue to make this a must stop every time we are in town and you should too."}
{"text":"Food ok, but Mint is so close, I'm not sure why I'd ever bother again.

Wait...why DID I come here?  That's right, the yelp \"deal.\"  They seemed extremely put out to have to handle with my take out order and their annoyance only increased when I mentioned my \"deal.\"  I apologize that you had to take my money, India Palace...I promise it'll never happen again!"}
{"text":"There are a few times that you come across a restaurant that really tingles your taste buds with every spoonful of every dish, this was what I felt when We went there (India Palace) for the Lunch buffet. It reminded me of the best of Indian food that can only be tasted in the old streets of delhi, where they have been preparing such recipes for ages handed down the generations. This is what you get at India palace. I was awestruck at finding such sumptuous Indian food in Vegas.....Hats off to the chef. If you love Indian food or would like to try it, don't waste your taste buds at any just masala & curry Indian restaurant....But go enjoy the true preparation of Indian cuisine @ India Palace as you will truly discover the true indian food preparation that will take you on an epic food rendezvous. I had to wait and talk to the owner (as he was on the phone) to thank him for the journey I took (through those old streets of India) with every spoonful.....Keep it up. A true gem....found only in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Food is great here. Restaurant is clean and service is good. Only negative here is the tiny parking lot. We had 2 cars, one parked at the bar next door and one car parked at the Siegel Suites, don't park at the Suites parking lot, they'll put an annoying sticker that doesn't peel off saying you are in violation. 
Anyways, their food is excellent. Loved the chicken tikka masala and the tandoori chicken."}
{"text":"Because the Groupon wasn't allowed to use for lunch buffet, we went for normal entree menus. And glad we did!

Items selected:

- Masala Dosa: Thin crispy rice crepes filled with deliciously spiced potatoes & onions
- Chicken Tikka Masala: Tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt & spices, simmered in a creamy tomato sauce
- Mango Lassi: Check-in bonus!

For Dosa, my all time favorite has been http://www.dosasf.com in SF, but India Palace does it in a different way. More crispy and lighter, which was really good!

Chicken Tikka Masala was also very good, and the naan was tasty. For basic items, execution is everything and they did quite well. Fresh and hot, no stale leftovers we usually see in lunch buffet were observed.

I'll return for the dosa."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with fellow yelpers Arlin B. Norm R. and Rand H. The food was was all pretty good,but not as great as I have read in many other reviews of this place. There was a couple of dishes I did not like. The monkey balls did not have the syrup,and the veggie marsala had a weird taste. There are lots of Indian buffets in town and to me this one is just average. I will add that the decor is nice and our service was ok."}
{"text":"Very unpleasant stuff, food was okay. Ive never seen an Indian restaurant that doesnt serve rice for curry, we had to order separately. I would not recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"So, Diamond Palace in Diamond Bar, CA had the best chicken tikka masala as of yet.  Well, I have finally discovered (so far) the winner of that title.  It now belongs to India Palace in Las Vegas, NV!  It is located a mile east of the Strip.  The neighborhood seems run-down but the restaurant is beautfully decorated and modern-looking.  
The flavours of the chicken tikka masala were perfect.  I ordered mine spicy and it had just the right amount of kick.  It was unanimous within our group of Indian Food-Lovers that this was the best place we've had yet.  The waiter recommended the rice dish Pea Pulao, which contained white basmati rice, peas, yellow raisins, and either peanuts or cashews (can't remember.)  He said it was more special and flavorful than the regular rice.  It was good also, but I prefer the plain rice.  The naan was perfect as well (but who could mess that up?)  I am sad that it is so far away because I can't eat it often, but luckily I visit Las Vegas a few times a year and it will make it that much more special to anticipate eating it.  I will never hit the casino buffets anymore and opt to go to India Palace's buffet instead! Now that's money well-spent!!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for a groupon offer, I would have kept on driving by this restaurant. It's not in the greatest neighborhood, so I never would have gave it a second thought.

However, I am glad we took a chance and we highly enjoyed our meal tonight. 

We ordered chicken korma, chicken tikka masala, 2 orders of garlic naan, and 1 plain naan.

Both curries we flavored just right. We ordered medium, but could've have handled a bit more kick in both curries. Naans were yummy as well - soft and fluffy. Garlic naan just had the right amount of garlic. 

The place was quite busy tonight, however service was not lacking. Nicely decorated interior as well.

I'd recommend this place if you were in the area and are in the mood for Indian."}
{"text":"Man, I think we just beat the rush! 

3 of us took a cab over here on Sunday evening for a quiet, off-strip meal. The yelp reviews spoke highly of this place so why not? 

We grabbed our free mango lassies with the check in and also purchased the $20 for $30 deal as we sat down. Oddly our waiter was a little cold when he took our drinks order but by the end of the evening he was all smiles and jokes. 

The food portions were healthy without being obnoxious. 

Though the place was largely empty when we stepped in around 6, by the time we left, there were a good 20-30 people lined up for the buffet. Clearly a popular choice."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, and the portions are larger than most Indian Cuisine restaurants around Vegas. Totally recommend checking this place out! Don't forget to try the assorted naan basket!"}
{"text":"Meh. Came here on a Sunday for the lunch buffet with my sister ($9.99 both weekdays and weekends). It was fine. Definitely had much better Indian food before. One of our favs was a cabbage sauté type dish. Some other entrees of the buffet included saag, mattar paneer, Chana masala, Dahl makhni, aloo Gobi, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, ground lamb, and lamb curry. 

The tandoori chicken was kinda dry and tough to eat and the chicken tikka masala didn't taste like a tikka masala. It tasted more like a soy ginger curry. Another downside was the garlic naan that came with the buffet - it was really flavorless and you could barely taste any garlic at all. It also sucked that you couldn't swap out naan for roti free of charge- for people who preferred the more earthy taste of the latter. 

Onto desserts- The Kheer was good, not too sweet on the palette, but the gajar halwa (carrot pudding) was way too sweet for our liking. 

The chai tasted good though. 

In our opinion, not really worth it, although we stuffed myself full. I'm sure there are better Indian restaurants around the area."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet.  Amazing food.  Great service.  Clean.  Reasonably priced. Kids had never tried Indian food until today and LOVED it.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have gone there before and the food and service was great. When I discovered that I can have it delivered through YELP I was ecstatic. The same great food but not having to walk two miles to enjoy it. Great food and convenient delivery through YELP!!!"}
{"text":"It was not too long ago that I tried this spot for the first time. Waiter could've been more enthusiastic and less rushing, it wasn't that busy for dinner. Main courses were served in a tiny bowl. I got the variety platter. Sauce was filling as usual and good but the dishes skimped on the meat, which was disappointing because the bowl was already small. I wish the price could've been more proportional to the amount of each dish served. I'll try other Indian spots."}
{"text":"Finally found an Indian place we like, thanks Groupon! We've tried so many places. Love the flavor of the chicken tiki masala here $15. Garlic naan $3 is crispy and garlicky..yumm. Rice tastes great but cost an extra $4, it's a big portion though and you can share it. Would go here every week if it was closer!  Craving it now as I write this review!"}
{"text":"Typical Indian restaurant. Greasy and oily food. Taste was okay. Experience was okay at best. 
- We used the yelp 15% off coupon here - the owner firstly frowned after looking at the deal (promotion that they had been running). He honored the deal but made us feel as if he was doing us a favor. 
- They were catering a private party in the restaurant and still kept it open for general public. The party family kids created havoc, noise and jumped on our tables. Horrible service, they never even cared to apologize for the inconvenience. At least they didnt serve us from the buffet as the party (which I have seen many cheap Indian restaurants do)
- There are many other good restaurants in Vegas that have great reviews on Yelp. Skip this one if you can."}
{"text":"Great Indian food for the price.  Most of the food is around $15.  I ordered Tandoori Fish $17.  According to the menu, \"The tandoor is North India's traditional clay oven, which is made of bricks & clay. It is used to cook food over direct charcoal heat. Meats cooked with this method are identified as Tandoori.\""}
{"text":"Great food but inattentive staff!

We were visiting Vegas for New Year's using the deal we got from LivingSocial. We had no idea that this was only for regular dining not the buffet. After a minute of standing there, somebody flagged down a waiter for us to have us seated (not sure if he was a diner or the owner but thank you whoever you are). We were seated in the corner and the waiter didn't seem to care because he left us alone for about 15 minutes without a menu or telling us what was going on. After observing everyone else, we noticed that they just got up and served themselves. Apparently it was a buffet. So, we decided to do the same. After we were done with our meal, that was when another waiter came up to us and told us that our LivingSocial deal was supposed to be for the regular menu not the buffet. He asked the manager and they decided to honor it. The meal was good because they had a variety to choose from. I just wished the had staff that were more attentive."}
{"text":"Great buffet and as a vegetarian, many options. Clean interior and quick service. You'll walk out stuffed."}
{"text":"The food was cold, the daal was stale and clearly was able to tell that it was made months ago and was frozen and reheated. The customer service wasn't too good. Had to ask for straws 3 times, had to ask for napkins twice, and extra sauces lots of times. Each request took FOREVER and the restaurant was empty. The presentation wasn't good, dishes looked like they were brought from home. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good.. I bought a $30 yelp deal, they used to let customers to use it for lunch buffet $13 per person, but I called them and the guy said no more, the deal is only for regular price items. I wish they can allow us to use it for lunch buffet again so I can group my friends/ former coworkers to eat and have some fun!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than a 2 star for sure. 
Food- ok to horrible .(some items of the buffet were fine). 
Service- waiters and the people working looked so sad and gloomy as if they were all stressed out.The food items in buffet were either mis labeled or no labels at all.

It's good they are not located in San Francisco Bay Area else they would have been out of business long time back ;)"}
{"text":"Solid food at this Indian restaurant but a little disappointing overall.  The best part of our meal was the vegetable jalfrezi as it had a lot of nice flavour and zing.  The bhuna beef was ok but on the otherhand, the jumbo prawn masala was overcooked and rubbery.  The rice and naan were just fine as was our onion bhajia appetizer (a little on the small side though).  I also found the layout to be cramped inside making for somewhat uncomfortable dining."}
{"text":"They have a great buffet for $8.99 and open till 3pm. The ambience is great and the staff are very courteous will definitely visit the next time"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian Food ! Hard to find such authentic Indian food in USA ! Very Good service by Vik. Will definitely come again !"}
{"text":"Good food, good customer service. I walked in and ordered carry out. No problems ordering and the food was ready quickly. I ordered a spicy level of 8, I should have gotten a 9!"}
{"text":"Pathetic food. Not hot at all. Worst service I have ever experienced. Tasteless food and quality. We are a group of 4 North Indians who decided to come for lunch buffet only to realize the staff cared least about what a restaurant is meant for: The Food"}
{"text":"This is such an amazing family owned restaurant. They have perfected their craft over many many years of hard work and have remained a top spot. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Good food, good buffet.  I'd come here more often if the lunch buffet had chicken tikka masala.  The service is very nice and friendly.  Everything look clean and well kept up."}
{"text":"SPAM !! SPAM !! SPAM


It's waste !! Not at all worth your money and very few items in the buffet !! 

First of all service is very slow and they don't know how to respond to the customers politely !!

They don't even provide desserts or starters or just one starter and one dessert .. !! 
 And guys don't believe in the reviews or rating given to it .. 

SPAM !! SPAM !! SPAM

They don't even the remove the plates in buffet !!"}
{"text":"India palace is a very good indian restaurant. Very good indian food not like others which really dont taste indian. And whenever u go there as for MANNY, he was very nice and funny made us feel very comfortable..."}
{"text":"Very good buffet lunch spread and a mango lassi worth yelping out!!

This place is way off the strip and a 
 pitstop worth the ride for all Indian food fanatics. The mutton / chicken dishes are good and nothing beats an all you can eat buffet for under $12 !!"}
{"text":"I love India Palace. The chicken saag is outstanding. The mint chutney is spicy and the service by Vick is second to none. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of many great Indian Restaurants here in the GTA.
This Indian restaurant is one of my top 5 Indian restaurants to go to when I'm in the area.
Their Buffet is fantastic, a lot of variety to choose from, all for $11.95 in which is not a bad deal since it's all you can eat. The servers are very friendly and provides excellent service! They always refilled my glass of water when i least expect it! If anyone is wiling to give them a try, please do! You will not be disappointed and while your there try out their signature drink: Mango Lassi, you will not be disappointed! I'll not say anything about it. Go down there and experience it yourself! And you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"This place was Amazing! This was our first time and we were so pleased. The food was flavorful and unique. The beef and chicken was so tender and so well cooked. The sizzling plates of food make you taste buds water. This is a place we will come over and over again. The staff was so helpful and kind. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I took a chance an ordered from this restaurant because of the positive reviews it received. They must have been talking about a different restaurant than I experienced tonight. It took 40 minutes longer than the promised delivery time of one hour and then I spent 10 minutes trying to find the driver after he went to the wrong place. Then the food arrived cold, was super greasy and not as ordered. To top it off, the entree portions were very small and did not include rice. This is the first time I have ever been to an Indian restaurants that you have to order rice separate from your entree. I wish they had made that clear here. I called the restaurant and they person that answered told me that's not how they do it and that I would have to purchase it and meet the minimum to have it delivered. If you are looking for good food, decent portion size or customer service, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  The service is warm and personal.  The garlic naan is a must.  We are hooked!!"}
{"text":"Service is good, staff friendly and food was delicious! We went at dinner time, but at lunch time they have a buffet!! Try it st lunch so you can taste all the flavors. Great find."}
{"text":"We go on a fairly regular basis because the food is very good and affordable. We've tried a lot of food on their menu, and everything has been very tasty. The staff are friendly and attentive, and the restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere. We've been many times, and we'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Best place ever!!! Super friendly staff! 

Group of six,we were all treated like kings from the second we walked in. Food was amazing and the staff were SUPER friendly.

Highly recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yelp deal is not worth. Menu items are overpriced. We tried Bombay fish. Taste was ok, but it is deep fried in batter. I was expecting something different. Tandoori chicken was ok, but kinda over cooked or over heated, may be it was heated many times. Tandoori roti was not good. Chicken curry was ok. Curry base was fine but chicken was not cooked properly, a bit rubbery."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Our waiter was friendly and on top it.  Filling water glasses.  Providing chutney and pappadam.    Food was tasty and timely served.  Try the paneer tikka.  Naan was fresh.  Chutneys are the best.   Would visit again when we visit Vegas.    Really good service.    We only ate vegetarian since it was Tuesday.  Worth it and excellent."}
{"text":"Very good food! I came here a couple times for their lunch buffet and paid about $17 (incl tip) each time. If you're a big eater, I would say it's well worth it. The staff is friendly and provided us good service each time."}
{"text":"Food is good. Family and I came here for the lunch buffet. They don't have much of a selection though. I did like the fact that they have vegan options. Staff is nice and always ready to help."}
{"text":"Delicious lamb korma, garlic naan, veggie dishes (anything spinach), basmati rice. Friendly service and low key environment."}
{"text":"We don't eat much Indian food, but this place was amazing. Our waiter Vick was excellent and took very good care of us. We let him select our meals for us! Chicken tika masala and the lamb rogan josh!

We highly recommend this place (we were only ones there at 4, so we had the place to ourselves)."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever having Indian food. It was a great experience. I'll check into some other Indian places. Unfortunately I can't remember what my wife and had because it was yesterday. But mine was Goat with rice and she had chicken with rice. Only annoyance was the goat still had the bone in it. It warns you about it but it had smaller pieces which were hard to find. Still worth it and will be back if I'm ever near again."}
{"text":"Having read all of the rave reviews, I decided to drive out to India Palace for some good Indian food.  I just moved to Phoenix and was really looking forward to it.  I got there about an hour before the lunch buffet ended, so I didn't expect everything to be perfect.  The food was pretty good, but not like I expected given the reviews.  The mango lassi was excellent, and the rice pudding was good, too.  Everything else was okay -- several dishes were spicier than I am used to, which was good.  The naan was good, too, and the service was prompt and friendly.  But the rice was either not fully cooked or had been in the pan way too long, as it was a little crunchy, and some of the sauces seemed watered down.  The buffet lacked the variety I was looking for.  I may be back if I'm in this part of town, but I wouldn't drive there again.  Decent food at decent prices with good service, though."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome! I have only had Indian food a few times. But this place is very flavorful with great freshness. We ordered delivery which showed up rather quickly. The only reason I docked one star was because only 1 item was labelled and when your new to a foreign food it helps to know what is what for future reference as well. Also because portions on some items seemed rarther scant for the price. They did forget the rice also, but made up for it with a quick delivery of it right away. Great flavor all around!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place! We arrived at 1:30 for the lunch buffet and we're pleased with clean interior and warm welcome we received. We chose a booth and were brought some freshly baked naan and drinks promptly. The buffet seemed small at first, but actually held a lot of choices, all of which were delicious. Our favorites being the tiki chicken masala and the lamb curry. They also had some desserts to go with the chi tea which was also part of the buffet.  Our only complaint was with the desserts which we felt were lacking in quality and aesthetics.  Over all for 10.00 a person you can't go wrong if you are craving some Indian food in this part of town."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall. I go to a lot of Indian restaurants, mostly in LA. This is my first in Vegas. Food was okay.

FOOD:
Mixed Veggie Pakora (4 stars): Not too oily so you don't feel too guilty. 

Naan (4 stars): Fluffy and yummy. This was actually really good here!

Chicken Tikka (4 stars): Juicy and moist chicken, really good. I'd recommend this. 

Mixed vegetables (1 star): Burnt vegetables. No flavor! I can't even believe they would serve this. The veggies were half black from being burnt. 

Requested a scrambled egg curry (3.5 stars): Was more of just dry scrambled eggs, didn't have a curry sauce. We asked for a curry sauce on the side and it made it taste better. 

SERVICE (4 stars):
The guy helping us was really nice. Listened to what we wanted and kept saying he understood our special requests but when the curry and sauces we requested came out they weren't what we wanted. So, I think he just thought he knew what we wanted. He did try though which was nice. 

ATMOSPHERE (4 stars):
Nice place on the inside. Clean and spacious. They have long tables in the middle for big groups, and booths on the side."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying- my boyfriend is Indian and he LOVED this restaurant. He is generally hesitant about dining out for Indian food because nothing can compare to his mamma's cooking- this restaurant was as close to home as it gets!!!

We are both vegetarians and loved that there were plenty of delicious options for us.  We had veggie samosas, vegetable biryani, red daal, saag aloo, and baigan bartha.  The bartha is rich and smoky tasting.  The daal was creamy and lucious.  Everything was spicy enough to get your taste buds excited but not so overwhelming as to make it painful.

We left with plenty to take home and snack on for the next two days.

The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated, we enjoyed the bollywood music videos playing around us.  I knocked off one star for service.  I dont expect good service at Indian restaurants and wasnt surprised with a service that was pretty much limited to throwing food on the table and bringing the check at the end.  They would also benefit from a fulltime bartender- while they had a full cocktail list I was hesitant to order from it doubting my waiter's ability to make a decent mojito.

When the craving for a taste of home returns we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"We had lunch buffet for $8.99/person - and it was awesome!
Everything we had was delicious and perfectly prepared. The tandoori chicken was moist and had a smokiness to it. The Lamb Curry was very meaty and tender, but my favorites on this visit were the Vegetable Pakora [sp?] - some of the best I've every had - and the Chicken Tikka Masala. I think they were making the naan fresh as we ordered it. Service was good and attentive - they kept our glasses full and were very friendly.

Highly recommended and we will definitely visit them again."}
{"text":"Slow service, and a bit weird... A server brought our appetizer to the table and then proceeded to reposition it on the plate with his hand...

But the food is delicious! The atmosphere is lovely, and the serving dishes and glasses are gorgeous copper ware."}
{"text":"I went to India Palace a few days ago with a friend for the lunch buffet.  It was delicious!  I am vegetarian so I appreciated that the buffet had several vegetarian options.  My friend had the tandoori chicken and she said it was very good.  I can't comment too much on the service, because the buffet does not require much from the server.  In the past I have had very good service at dinner time."}
{"text":"I went here for vacation and this place is AMAZING, many of the dishes are superior to any other indian food I have ever tasted. Especially try the butter chicken and the variety of meats they have! The customer service is great. They also respond really fast which is nice."}
{"text":"Very bad food. Not of good quality. Paneer tikka wasn't grilled and was fried instead of that. Same goes for paneer tikka in this case the paneer was raw instead of grilled. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Brought my family here on Father's Day and it was the worst ever. As soon as we got there we were constantly rushed. The server was telling us we're gonna have to place our order right away because they're going to have a big party soon. So we were rushed and just ordered appetizers and before our appetizer even arrived he came back and said I hope you guys have your main dishes ready and we said no and he was like well you need to order now I don't want you blaming me if the food takes to long to come out .. !?!?!?! I was like wth you need to chill! Anyways besides the server they didn't have a bartender a lot of items we were trying to order such as samosas and kabobs he said they didn't have any at the moment. So after that the food arrives the lamb taste spoiled and the chicken tikka was not all that. The chicken was over cooked and the flavors didn't melt in your mouth like it should. So after all this disappointment we look at our bill and realize that one little bowl of chicken tikka with literally 4 cubes of chicken was $15.95?!?!?!?! Oh and the garlic was neither garlicky nor buttery but it sure was burnt.  This is ridiculous. Bad and overpriced food with bad service. Oh and to make it worse there was a bug on the ceiling right above our table. Will not ever be coming back again. There are far too many good Indian restaurants in Las Vegas to come back here. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving  india palace 1 for their buffet.  The  chicken was dry and the food was less than ok. The cost of $24.00 for 1 buffet,2 drinks, and  if they charged for nan I did not know      It. Before you know it, I was running for the rest room! 

I've been there plenty of times for their lamb dinner and it was excellent. 
    All I can say is ....
skip the buffet and have their dinner!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time.  The papadums were tasty and came with three sauces: mint, spicy and a brown one.  I like the brown one.. not sure what flavor it is.  The mint and spicy sauces were too spicy for me since I'm pregnant.  

Our starters was papdi chaat which was crunchy with a great taste.  For our main courses, we shared the chicken tikka and shrimp jalfrezi with rice and roti.  The rice is a huge portion which we didn't even eat half of.  The chicken tikka was very tasty with the onions and peppers.  The chicken tikka tasted even better with the brown sauce that comes with the papadums.  The shrimp jalfrezi was great over rice and placed on the roti.  The food is delicious.

The service was great.  Indians always know how to give good service."}
{"text":"I went on Sunday morning for the buffet, the food was hot , fresh, and very tasty. I wish they served plain rice, but it was a vegetable rice , it was very good. I loved the lentils, and the bread. My boyfriend had never eaten Indian food before , and he really  liked it. Some of the dishes have a little spice to them , which I love, and surprisingly enough, so did he.
The service was excellent, never had to flag them down to ask for anything. Glad I went here , will be back again."}
{"text":"We were in town for an event and had the chicken tikka masala, the samosas, the orange drink with yogurt, the garlic naan and the fried fish.  Loved it all. Mostly like that it was romantically lit, and the service was ok.  I love trying different things."}
{"text":"Very nice INDIAN restaurant... the food is fairly priced and AMAZING IN QUALITY.  BEST LAMB CHOPS AND CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA by far in VEGAS!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Great Indian food.  Excellent prices.  Lots of vegetarian options.  The spice in this place is wonderful and flavorful. Authentic Indian food.  Queen street is such and interesting and electric street with lots of food choices. I think Indian Palace is a perfect place to come in after an afternoon shopping.   

I tried the Kaju Matar Paneer, flavorful and yummy.  The cheese was the right consistency, the herbs were fresh. I didn't' try the naan - but the rice was fresh and for those of you who have read my reviews before know i am judgmental over rice."}
{"text":"What they lack in square footage and style they make up for in food and friendliness.

Stop in to India Palace for a lunch buffet, it is affordable, fresh and delicious!

The staff were so nice to us, even though we hauled in there with a stroller, diaper bag and a baby!  Our waters were refilled, our plates cleared and good conversation was had with the owner.

The vegetarian options are wonderful, over half of the buffet on the day we visited.

I noticed there was wine but did not imbibe, I did not save room for any dessert either.  Perhaps you will."}
{"text":"Impossible to take pics of this food since as soon as it hits Our table we inhale everything.... BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER, Great prices, always has a groupon for 4 bucks off (buy for $4 get a groupon for $8 off order,,,)  CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA (now I can die knowing I have tasted heaven)"}
{"text":"For Las Vegas standards, this is fantastic Indian dining establishment.  The food is fresh and very tasty.  The saag paneer is subperb and the price is just right for the lunch buffet.     And no lunch would be complete without a bit of Bollywood in the background."}
{"text":"We frequent this place for the lunch buffet which is one of the better ones we've tried in this city, which is why they deserve a 4. The only downside is that this was the first time we've come here for dinner and the service was great at first but ended up being really slow towards the later part of our meal. We waited 15 minutes for our second order of naan. It's safe to say we will not return for dinner but will definitely come back for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"For those who are confused. this used to be the India Palace on 51st and Greenway and prior to that it was on 7th avenue and Bell. It seems the quality of the food changes with each new location. The quality of the food has changed..and not for the better unfortunately. I stil think India Palace is one of the better Indian restaurants in the valley and would recommend it for the casual Indian diner. But for an Indian person or a non-Indian who is used to eating Indian food and has more discriminatory tastes, I would ask you to go elsewhere. I recently dined here and it had the same problems it had last time. It's curries are too watery. It's naan are too small and \"dish rag\" like and pala/saag was also very runny and had a baby food like consistency.  The nice thing about this place is of course it's ambience which is beautiful, contemporary and new. The service is also pretty good here."}
{"text":"Awesomeness! If you want to get a variety on a budget try the buffet that's starts at 11a. I love the owner too, he and his workers aren't afraid to make you truly enjoy your experience. They are very accomodating, and the food, mind you ice been there numerous times is alway on point! They always try new things last time we were there they have this 3 sauce tray with a spicy red a mint green sauce and a nice medium and all were good. I love that though sometimes they will just present new things for the evening and it always rocks. It was hard to find a true curry spot after leaving Cali. But here it is. We have goat, shrimp and chicken curry."}
{"text":"Although a buck or two more than others for the lunch buffet, it's worth it! It's the tastiest I've had so far. 
The manager was very helpful pointing out the vegan offerings, even offering an all I can eat from the menu if the buffet didn't suffice. It did and was very tasty. He even brought me lentil crackers, since their bread was non-vegan. 
Nice atmosphere inside, nicely decorated. 
For my personal taste (shared by very few ) it was too salty, but my friends found it very much to their liking. I checked in for the Mango Lasi, but gave it to a friend bcuz it's non-vegan. My friend loved it.  
It is where it is, but you're driving, right? If you like Indian food, check this out. The owner is from Punjab."}
{"text":"Right down the street from the 'financial district' of Vegas you will find the hidden gem in one the ghetto hoods of LV. Inside this palace it is very clean and the $12 buffet is tasty. I loved it when I ate meat and appreciate it 10x's more now that I don't. The veggie dishes with naan bread is all I need for lunch. Keep that naan bread coming because its the best i've had. It always fresh and hardly ever doughy. Try the veggie fritters too. Dam, my mouth is starting to water just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Food was extraordinary.  My girlfriend and I tried two dinner specials and we really enjoyed everything.  Prices are pretty high, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"For some reason all Indian restaurants look about the same, why is that? I really can't tell them a part once inside.

Haven't had Indian food and they are usually good. The waiter was attentive and nice just like any other Indian restaurant, the place was clean and food was good, just like other Indian restaurants I've been too. 

The usually safe bet Butter Chicken was different here, it was a little sweeter. We also got the recommended spinach lamb dish which was great. The naan was prepared really well. Overall a good experience here."}
{"text":"Everything was alright. Except when I presented the yelp coupon, the waiter gave a bad look !!!
PS: The bill came to 0 after the coupon :p"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch today.  Definitely coming back.  Great buffet.   Good food. Not greasy or oily at all.  Nice selection.  Clean.  

Just wish I'd found this place ages ago."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great company!  I was visiting Vegas for a convention and was craving Indian food.  I saw on yelp that they were doing a special offer and dined here.  Totally worth it!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Having just moved to Vegas and missing my favourite Indian restaurant back home, we gave India Palace a try, using  a restaurants.com  coupon.
We started with appetizer plate - 5 appetizers of your choice.  I had a lichi martini and my hubby ordered the beer recommended by our waiter.  Everything was awesome! 
We then ordered Lamb Rogan Josh and Goat Curry, basmati rice and garlic naan.
It was all sooooo good!  Very fresh, very flavourful.  Nice, clean restaurant, with lovely atmosphere and wonderful wait staff.  Waiter then directed us to YELP for the coupon here.
Can't wait for my next craving!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Indian restaurants around and this one is by far the best and my favorite. It was refreshing to be greeted by Manny with such spectacular hospitality as if we were family and the customer service was amazing! He was extremely friendly and pleasant and made my experience there top notch. Vick was wonderful and helpful as well. The food was phenomenal, much so that we went back two more times during our stay in Las Vegas! Every dish was so absolutely delicious and seasoned perfectly. Also, the portions were quite generous and they had a huge vegetarian selection. With service and food that was out of this world, there is no need to go anywhere else! I will definitely be returning every time I go to Vegas. India Palace is my favorite place to dine in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for years.  The past two trips have been unsatisfactory, and unfortunately,  we will not be returning.  The last visit our Korma was separated,  and a greasy mess,  and they still served it to us.  I had to ask them to return it to the kitchen and make a new batch.  This time we ordered take out,  and the Naan was soggy and doughy."}
{"text":"I've been here before and had tried to find it again to no avail. A friend and I happened to both want Indian at the same time, but having no idea where to go turned to my trusty Yelp app and it found this awesome place for me again! 

It's tucked off in a little shopping area, but well lit and easy to find. It's got a great, cozy interior with roomy booths and Indian movies playing constantly. It has a full bar also!

Checked in using my Yelp app and received a free drink called a mango lassi. I would never have known to ask for this had I not gotten this check-in offer, but I'm so glad I did. It was seriously delicious. It's mango and yogurt and it was part of the reason I couldn't eat all of my food. Highly recommend you get this fabulous drink!

For an appetizer we had vegetable samosas. They were dense and a little dry, but with the spicy cilantro sauce to put on it it tasted just fine. You get two and they're a nice size. 

For dinner my friend had chicken tikka masala, which, while not outside the box is definitely a solid choice. He liked it and proceeded to eat all of it. I had the mata paneer and it was just the right spicy (medium) with a rich tomato-y taste mixed with peas and the paneer cheese. Had it over a bed of jasmine rice and it was super filling. One of my favorite dishes.

Also ordered a side of garlic naan which was okay. It wasn't the best I've ever had, way too much garlic, but it was find and went okay with the meal. 

The service here can be spotty, I wasn't impressed with that at all, but it's not the worst I've had, so...

Anyway, great food, nice atmosphere and at a reasonable price. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped there on our way to flagstaff. The restaurant is priced pretty reasonably for the quantity of food.  Food was decent. The place served poppadum with chutney for free. We ordered malai kofta, lamb korma, garlic naan, shahi rice and raita. Everything tasted food. I was a little disappointed with the pistachio kulfi as it had a dough texture but it still taste good."}
{"text":"Best Indian lunch buffet I have had while living in AZ. Dishes are flavorful , staff is very attentive. Their Nan is sooooo fresh. I try to come her once a week for my Indian food fix. The selection changes every day and everything is good. I never leave here disappointed."}
{"text":"Main dishes were good and plentiful...chicken makhani was exquisite,  chilli chicken was very well prepared. ..appetizers were ok, mixed grill was expensive for relatively small portion..good experience overall.."}
{"text":"We live about 6-7 minutes from here and have loved it from the first time we ordered. The food and portions are very consistent and the service is wonderful. I became a big fan of Indian food since finding this restaurant; everything we tried is absolutely delicious. Definitely recommend if your visiting or live in Vegas to try out this place. We have only stayed to eat twice because it's usually so busy, we order take out or delivery the most."}
{"text":"Food was ok- service was mediocre. I'm totally cool with crappy service if the food is worth the wait, it was not."}
{"text":"I have been to Las Vegas so many times but had never come across this place until this past April.  I am very happy I did.  The restaurant is clean. We made it for a weekend buffet. There were many vegetarian options. Just the only complaint I would have is that the pakoras were not so fresh and the dosa was cold.  But that would not stop me from returning. 

I found the wait staff to be quite attentive and friendly.  I would definitely return on my next trip."}
{"text":"Make food Indian way but do not have a clue about flavor or the way some things are cooked.. Tried it couple of time but was disappointed"}
{"text":"Not the most knowledgable nor credible when it comes to indian food but this place was beyond amazing. If there was a party tonight, it was in my mouth! My taste buds were having a field day! I love saucy foods and many dishes were just that! Everything was sooo good. We ordered a generous variety everything from chicken, goat to lamb. could of done without the lamb skewers... Something about ground up lamb compacted together made the texture a bit odd for me.

The chicken Masala and Their goat dish as well as the mango lassi was also quite tasty, the ambiance was not too casual yet not too upscale perfect for date night, beer and service was also up to par! Check in on yelp for a free mango lassi ;)  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We went in after looking at the 500 odd reviews on yelp, but this place was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!

Paneer tikka masala: I wish I could take the chef/owner to a nice Indian restaurant and let them experience what a garlic naan and Paneer tikka masala tastes like. The naans felt like they were soggy and uncooked.

The goat curry :GOAT curry had OKRA, CARROT, GREEN PEAS , CARROT ETC.. It did have some goat but looked like it was the left over navaratan korma from the afternoon and he just added some goat to it.

Icing on top of the cake : When we told the waiter that the food was a disaster , he offered to get us one more of the same Naan ! 
Seriously! There are better places in Vegas to fill your empty stomach!"}
{"text":"One of the better Indian restaurant in the valley. Food is fresh and delicious. Chicken Tikka and Lamb curry was yum"}
{"text":"We went there on Christmas evening and just to be be precise just spoiled the dinner.
Simply unprofessional and rude. The place was dirty, people were coming and eating and food was scattered under the tables and they don't care about it. 

Had to ask 3 times to get water and silverware.
They asked to go for buffet as there was rush and order will take a lot of time. The food was cold in buffet and not refilled properly and food was not something to have 4 start rating inspite of the yucky service

I have never seen such unprofessional people and place with 4 start review in yelp.

Printing photos with celebrities on the wall doesn't make the place nice!
It needs food and service too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in an unsafe ghetto area. We ordered the
chicken biriyani and it was terrible, and not authentic. The floor of the restaurant was covered with some sticky spilled liquid. The service from the waiter and other staff was horrible. Is it so hard to crack a smile when you see a customer come into the restaurant.Very unhappy wait staff. The chicken in the chicken biriyani was terrible, no flavor at all. Skip this place and go to an Indian restaurant that serves really good food and has a caring and friendly waitstaff. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken biryani, butter chicken. It delivered on time. Both the item was freshly made but taste not good and not satisfied my indian tongue."}
{"text":"First time was very impressive. They bring out fresh baskets of naan . We are excited to bring our kids back."}
{"text":"I've been all around the world eating Indian food. Especially, Dosas. Their dosas are mediocre. They're supposed to have a crunch to them. However, theirs came collapsed and slightly cold. The Malai Kofta we ordered was a touch bland. 

Now the tragedy...they charge $4 for a small bowel of basmati rice. I've never heard of ordering curry without a serving of rice. What a rip off. 

So bottomline is that you get mediocre food for a terrible price. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I dropped in with a buddy for the lunch buffet, it was OK.  The fare is standard for an Indian place, lamb curry, chicken tikka masala, naan bread.  Here's a tip if you offer a buffet, don't bother offering salad if all you're going to have is iceburg lettuce and canned fruit.  I'm glad they honored the 2-1 coupon for the buffet, and the service was polite and good."}
{"text":"We come here all the time and are always impressed at how great the food is.  I love that they serve hot, fresh garlic naan with the buffet.  And today they had Ras Malai!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I tried India Palace for the first time. We used to go to a different place for years that closed so we were looking for a new regular place for Indian cuisine.

My wife ordered Paneer masala and I got the saag lamb, we shared a side of basmati rice.

Flavors were awesome, very potent and aromatic. Both dishes seem to have more onion in them than I'm used to but the flavor wasn't affected.

The reason for my 2 stars isn't the price or flavors, but rather the fact that I'm writing this at 4am after a long, very painful night of food poisoning. I'm thankful that my pregnant wife didn't eat my food (saag lamb). She's fine.

We may come back but it certainly won't be for a long while. I can't risk that with my wife."}
{"text":"Love this place! Curries are very tasty their Naan is oh so yummylicous!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Indian food places in Vegas. In case you want to eat and taste only chili paste, come and order spicy food here - especially stuff from theta door like kebabs. I typically never leave reviews, but this is one of the places where they asked how the food was, and despite telling them it was terrible, they did not bother to take any action. Anyhow. Hope this helps someone. My last time here for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered garlic naan, malai kofta and biryaani. Biryani was tasteless. Also the naan came out cold and stale like. Even complaining to the staff was not helpful. Bad experience overall. Not going again"}
{"text":"What an awesome buffet!  Not only was the food amazing but the service was great. Our server offered us some garlic naan that was excellent. The decor was beautiful and we plan on being back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and very helpful recommendations. They were on point with the water refills :) Garlic nan, butter chicken, sag paneer, and eggplant barta were excellent! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I couldn't leave Sin City without an Indian dinner. There are no Indian spots that I'm aware of in Henderson but the logistics of my visit had me spend the last night a few blocks East of the strip putting me in close proximity to several spots.

I chose IP since it was the closest and with car rental already returned I was walking it. Plus of my options it had the highest rating.

I had the Lamb Rogan Josh which the menu describes as \"Kashmiri delicacy cooked with intensely hot & fragrant spices\" which it was but it did not compete well with the LRJ I had in Philly. 

I did have something called 'Temrin Sauce' with the very thin wafer type cracker not Naan but if you've eaten Indian you know what my brain doesn't  but the Temrin Sauce was a treat t remember.

The goin out the door on IP is, I'm looking for a repeat of my LRJ experience in Philly and it could be IP's is more authentic and I'm simply DUH. There was a presence of Indian clientele so perhaps I am more DUH then IP is in authenticity. When I'm in these parts again I will give IP a try again"}
{"text":"In some circles, referred-to simply as \"The Palace,\" this place has a solid lunch buffet and good service. Priced at about $10 per person for a variety of good Indian food, it's a lunch-time slam dunk every time... although adding a couple more dishes to the mix would be ideal. It's an OK value for dinner, although, in my opinion, slightly overpriced for good, but not out of this world, Indian."}
{"text":"This is our second time coming to this place and my last. This first time the waiter was rude but i chalked it up to maybe he was having a bad day. This is now my second time. I don't mind waiting for a table but when you do finally seat me and don't hand me any menus. At first I gave them the benefit that maybe they were super busy but here we go again same server and same bad attitude.

I had to get up to find another worker to give us menus. And when the server finally came to the table to give us water I asked him for lemons and the mango lassi that I ordered. I waited another good 10-15 mins before having to get up and flag the server down to ask him for the lemons and drink

Further more when they never came back to check on our table or refill our waters. Throughout the whole meal and time we were here the servers were clearing the tables which is normal but the kicker was they didn't do it in a quite discrete manner they were slamming cups and plates down to the point where we could not even here our conversation. 

When we were finally ready for the to go boxes and the check we had to flag him down yet again and wait another 10 mins or so for the boxes and when receiving our check it was charged wrong. Big surprise. At this point there was only about 3 tables including us. And they weren't short on staff at all. 

As for the food it's good but nothing that I can't get at some of my other Indian spots with great service! 

I think the only reason why this place has so many stars is because it is the closet one to the strip with nicer decor. But I would give up nicer decor for better food and service at a place that values there customers!"}
{"text":"Weekend buffet is okay, compare the low cost, may have a try, but don't order Mongo Lassi, taste terrible and not fresh, and cant believe with ice!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles and searched for dinner on our first evening here.  First, lental soup was yummy if you like curry... I loved it!  The platters and sandwiches were huge and delicious.  You can totally share a platter or the gyros. Totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Have you ever had one of those dining experiences which end with your taste buds telling you \"Gimme more, more!\" but your stomach says \"Stop already, there's no more room!\"  Well, that's the experience I had today at India Palace Cuisine. Spurred on by the reviews of Rand and other yelpers, I decided to try this place for my weekly boo-fay excursion.  

Getting there was no problem: it's just a block off I-17 at W. Bell and parking was no problem because it's in a strip mall which is mostly empty. The place is clean, a bit dimly lit which is great for a more relaxing experience, and the staff was friendly - and they remained so even though they were dealing with a lunch crowd that included a cricket team when I went there. I was seated in a comfortable booth and immediately served a basket of piping hot naan bread fresh from the tandoor.

The buffet selection was not huge, unlike in Chinese buffets, but definitely more than adequate. The biryani rice was excellent, as was the basmati. The curries (I just had to try them all) were very flavorful and spiced on the milder (for me) side, but there were also cooling condiments for those who might find the heat level of the spices a bit daunting. There were more than enough delectable vegetable selections to make vegetarians very happy. And the tandoori chicken was good though not great. In all, the quality of the food was such that I kept going back for more until I grudgingly gave in to my stomach's pleas to stop already. Nevertheless I still managed to sneak in a tiny taste of the desserts - a spoonful each of the two puddings and just one ball of ladoo in syrup.

Going back (or was it waddling back) to my car, I decided that I needed to do something to compensate for having eaten so much, so I decided to proceed to the Rio Salado Habitat Restoration Area and walk its trails ... and that will be the subject of my next review ;-)"}
{"text":"We come here at least once every couple of weeks and we are never disappointed!  Tonight we had the mixed grill(meats made in the Tandoori oven), Lamb Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala - all were simply de-lish!!! If you are in the area, stop by!! They even have a lunch buffet, we haven't made it yet but it's in our radar!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We went with simple order of Chana, mushroom Marar masala and daal tadka. Daal tadka was delicious. We also ordered samosa and those were the best. The place has simple decor. The menu has many vegetarian and non-vegetarian options serving North Indian and South Indian food. The service was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"The food was good I'll give them that, but their service and credibility are questionable. Though I strongly recommend looking elsewhere for Indian food if you must go here check your bill. These guys messed up our bill and then refused to address it saying that during the holidays that's what their policy is. 

They also don't take gift cards during the holidays and apparently all of Las Vegas recognizes the holidays as December 25th through December 31st. Though I don't work in the restaurant industry I still have work tomorrow. 

Also they took forever to take our order, then forgot what we ordered and had to take it again, and brought dishes out one at a time; cause maybe some people like cold food?

Either way service being shitty, not the only place. But blatantly cheating customers is a whole new level of shady. It's good food but if you must go be careful."}
{"text":"Good food.  Fresh naan and tandoori chicken.  Service was real good as well.  After eating lunch, won't be hungry until breakfast next day."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and my bud, who is Indian. We heard some great things about this place from school mates and decided to go in to catch the lunch buffet. 
I loved everything, the tandoori chicken was tasty and cooked just right!
The owner of this place actually recognized me from my adult movies and came out personally to greet me.
Excellent time here, definetely will be coming back ;)"}
{"text":"The food was very good, and I highly recommend mixing and sharing some dishes with those you come with. However, I must say that our server pressured us a lot, and made our eating experience very uncomfortable. For that reason, I don't see myself returning for another visit."}
{"text":"I have been eating here regularly since I discovered how amazing their food is a few years ago. It has been one of the few Indian food places I've found in Arizona that compares to my favorite place from Seattle.
I cannot speak highly enough about their food and I love the staff.
My favorite dish is the malai kofta."}
{"text":"My first time having Indian food and it's great! Ordered Chicken Tikki Marsala w Nan and rice. They have some pretty good teas my friends liked but I had no more room to fit it:))"}
{"text":"try their mango lassie.  It's killer but very filling.  You'll want a second one but if you do you'll never want to eat dinner."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and left happy.  I'm a relative newcomer to Sin City and am always satisfied when I try a new eatery with great results.  I had the lunch buffet and everything was fresh, tasty, and colourful without any nasty aftertaste (something I've experienced at other ethnic places).  My favourite dishes included the goat tikka masala and the saag paneer....the chutney was pretty good too, especially on top of the naan.  :) For about $12+tax, one can eat his or her fill of nicely spiced Indian food that is heavy on flavour and light on the grease.  Both vegetarians and carnivores have plenty of options with which to fill their bellies!  I plan on coming back again soon to try the dinner menu...."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Vegas. I have worked at Indian restaurants and my closest business partners are Indian. When it comes to food Indian in Vegas, look no further than India Palace."}
{"text":"After watching the movie, Life of Pi on Blu-Ray, I was craving for Indian food. Found this place thanks to Groupon. My friend and I decided to hit up this place after she was done drunk shopping at Fashion Show Mall. LOL.

Came around 6 for dinner. Right after we sat down, there was an influx of customers for dinner. Whew. Got the orders in and didn't have to wait long. Ordered the following:

Appetizer Combo - Samosa, Aloo Tikki, Veggie, Chicken and Paneer Pakora. This was the first plate that came out. Duh, it's an appetizer. It's pretty decent and sharing it with two people is good enough.I enjoyed the samosa and the paneer pakora the most. 

Chicken Tikka Masala and Fish Tikka Masala with plain Basmati Rice. Ok, so the entree is where my heart somewhat melts. Got them both at medium spicy. It was too much gravy-yyy and not enough meat. Meat - gravy ratio: 1:3. 

Bottom line, I would hit up this place again, but would try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"We are local and found this place and was very pleased.  This is one of the most authentic Indian restaurant's you will find.  Chili chicken and Butter chicken are theeee Best.

Customer Service: Very friendly staff!! Manpreet took care of us , Very nice people! And, service is pretty fast! I would say the wait for your food is about 15 mins or less! 

Overall:  MY FAVORITE Indian food restaurant!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and deep with flavors! Friendly environment that is clean. Get the naan bread!!! It's incredible. Generous portions and. Took some home for lunch. 
The Indian tea is scrumptious."}
{"text":"So I come here all the time and I love it. It's always clean and everything tastes great. The mushroom masala is to die for. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in Vegas. The goat curry was amazing. I could drink the sauce. Butter chicken isn't on the menu but they made it for us.

Everything is served a la carte so it adds up. Rice and naan isn't included. It's not a cheap meal, so come for the lunch buffet if you can, but don't expect to find lamb or goat.

Service is friendly, our server was slightly shy but opened up eventually. It's a nice restaurant in a kinda sketchy part of town. Once i get back into town, I'm def making a stop here."}
{"text":"I'm Indian and can attest to the authenticity and quality of the food. Some dishes were a little heavy on the ginger, but that's the only complaint I could even think of. The paneer and korma were EXCELLENT, the service was great, and space was also lovely. Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"I am not the person in my family who would ever say, hey lets go have East Indian food. Not that I do not like Indian food, I just never had good Indian food here in the USA. In London yes and go first thing when we arrive. But my mate a friend out voted me and we went to India Palace tonight.

It is located in a dingy sad strip mall but the actual restaurant is nice inside. It is clean and comfortable but does have some odd looking chairs at their tables.

We ordered a plate with a variety of meats on it some naan and rice, my friend ordered some chicken thingies and soup.. It all was very tasty with some of the bites hiding a bit more heat than others. So it is good enough that I would go back.

The service is very friendly but very erratic in getting dishes out to you and need a reminder that you did indeed order more than brought out. If the service could smooth it self out, it would have been a great meal."}
{"text":"Worst North Indian food ever ! Stale food , bad service . Don't ever take a buffet that is even worse . I would rather eat pizza than food over here. This is not even close to what Indian food should taste like . Pathetic ! What a waste of money . Not recommending anyone"}
{"text":"Was for dinner last night...

Not a WOW indian restaurant....but a decent place and i would say good enough for the price.

Liked the idea of spring rolls at an indian restaurant...and was done very well...Kudos! i have had samosas/cutlet/pakoras but never spring rolls...

I ordered palak paneer n paratha...i got just 5 pieces of paneer and a boat loat of spinach...Paratha were done really well..

Indian restaurants in general need to understand the ratio of curry and veggies/meat they serve in a portion and be wary of what goes on every customers table...

the waiter was nice and courteous, nice n chatty crowd...overall an OK experience."}
{"text":"We LOVE Indian food and have searched the City (Phoenix) for some that's good.  This place is EXCELLENT!!  Buffet is reasonable (8.95) espec. considering all the great choices they offer.  Salad items are always fresh, and there are always several veggie dishes AND meat dishes - and NOT watered down like a few places we've been!   They also have great customer service, comfortable booth and table seating, and free 'Indian' tea available as self-service instead of the usual $2.00/cup!   For VERY good food, and great value, GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Excuse the rough neighbourhood that this gem is located in, if definitely a diamond in the rough. I had the lunch buffet small selection but great quality food and a great Value. My favourite was the Goat Curry and Garlic Naan but everything was excellent If you haven't tried Indian Cusine before try this spot"}
{"text":"We have been to this place 4 times now and each time it gets better and better. I haven't had anything bad. All the food is great alot of flovor. I would recommend to anyone wanting to try Indian food."}
{"text":"Was excited to check out Vegas Indian food. Saw some good reviews but I'm at home watching football so I ordered a delivery. A little hard ordering because I had to repeat myself the same thing several times. Not a problem though. I actually consider that to be a good sign because it means it's authentic if the one on the phone must be the best speaker of English. After a little struggling while ordering I asked the price because the guy was about to hang up without saying it. All I ordered was chicken bartha rice and garlic naan. I told the guy I only had $40 so if they don't take a card, I hope it's less. He said, oh yes, no problem it's $30!!! Hey, no problem... Maybe it's actually worth it. Funny that when it arrived 45 minutes later in a small container with no receipt that the driver mysteriously had no change. For a cash only place, one would think the driver has change. Oh well, $40 for a $20 meal that was barely par level in flavor. Driver told me, \" next time say you don't want a delivery fee. \" Do you think I'm that stupid? Wow... There's not gonna be a next time! For a few extra dollars, people really know how to ruin a fair review. Although the portion was small. I found a clump of dried herbs in my mouth. Yuck. And really just OK but might be fooled into it tasting good if the driver wasn't so sneaky. And this is the highest reviewed in local area? No thanks"}
{"text":"Best indian food on this side, not greasy and authentic with the flavoring and the service was great. My water was never empty."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure about their vegan options here. They showed us what was vegan and we ordered those. We weren't sure if everything we ordered was even vegan though? 

They brought us a green dip with the chips, that I tried, to see if it was vegan, and it didn't taste vegan. We asked, and it was not..kinda bummed me out they gave us something non-vegan anyways knowing we were vegan...also gave us a dessert at the end that was clearly not vegan with milk and butter. So I'm not sure if they understood we were vegan or not?? 

The flavors were on point though! Everything tasted so bomb! But I hate not knowing what ingredients are in my food..so I guess I probably wouldn't take the chance again. 

Woke up pooping not how we normally do...lol and us vegans know what that means..there must have been butter used in one of our dishes to make our bodies react so differently than they normally do. We take our health more serious than anything else, so I just wouldn't risk it. Sucks because the food was SOOO good :("}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. If you go to Vegas, you must try it. Besides the delicious food, the service was top notch. Garry and pavan served us and treated us very well, he made us laugh and was very patient with our complicated order. Overall 100% satisfaction from their customer service."}
{"text":"This was such tasty punjabi food, I just loved it, we were visiting with family from India and even if my taste buds have changed a lot living here, they said this was the best that they have seen so far, the place got really crowded soon after we were seated that did not frazzle them a bit, service was awesome, food arrived in no time and in all one of my best experiences for Indian food in a place filled with visitors, can't wait to go back. : ))"}
{"text":"Food is not really fresh. The taste is just average. Confused why so many good reviews in yelp. 
Took buffet lunch and paper dosa and chai. Paper dosa was thick and no taste at all in chutney or sambhar. 
The staff isn't polite. Asked me if I want any drink without showing menu. Did not bother to ask if I need anything else during entire lunch or for that matter even show up their face so I could tell them. Muttered something unclearly \"server something\" when I asked for the chai ordered and left. It was like they are just serving for the sake of it. 
My husband got sick right after eating buffet. I am not from Vegas and will advise others against it who wish to go here based on reviews ."}
{"text":"My experience with dining at Indian restaurants are pretty much buffet, buffet, non-buffet, and buffet. India Palace is probably my 2nd favorite right now but it's probably still a 3.5 star place. It's located on the south side of Twain some where between Swenson and Paradise.  It's not in the best locations but it's not that far from the Strip or University which is always good.

They offer a lunch buffet M-F for pretty much the same price as every other Indian lunch buffet north of $10. The selections aren't huge but for what they offered mostly delicious. Again I'm not that experienced with Indian food so I don't even know what the dishes are called so I made a plate of everything I liked and took a pic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/india-palace-las-vegas?select=vWiliowVruUMaseO6VB4sA#HZgrIxObIsFSwoe5_ea8lQ There were a couple dishes which seemed spicier than the other places I've been to and I really enjoyed. The garlic naan here was the best I've had. The red chicken was spicy just the way I liked it. There's potential to be my favorite place but I couldn't, I only really liked maybe 3 or 4 of the items on the buffet.

At the time there was a free lassi with Yelp check-in unfortunately they only accepted one for our entire party but I got it haha. The mango lassi was good, great way to end the meal.

The interior is nice with many tables and a few TV's playing Indian movies. It seemed like a pretty full bar. Their parking situation isn't great. Sevice was alright. I'd be back, during day."}
{"text":"It's one of the best Indian restaurants in Phoenix. I would highly recommend this place for great quality food and an excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I live out East and have dined here during my last 2 trips to Vegas. The food is very good, the staff very nice. Well-sized portions as well. Good value for your money. Will definitely go back & would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love their food and I love their service. The staff are so friendly, they come over and chat with us every time we eat there. They reccommend new thigs for us to try and it's always so delicious that I can't stop eating. It is by far the best Indian food you can get in the area. Try the spinach fritters and the mango lahssi drink(don't know how it is spelled, sorry). The prices are also very reasonable.

The atmosphere is also nice and there is a Sunday brunch whic is decent. The brunch food is not quit as good as the freshly made food, but it is a good value."}
{"text":"I've been eating vegetarian for the pat few weeks, so my my restaurant options are slim. We decided to try the Indian Palace. My friend ordered the Masala, hot and spicy. I ordered my meal medium.  Everything was great....except next time, Ill order my meal \"hot\". The medium spice just didn't cut it."}
{"text":"My food companion and I came here many times for dinner. She is memorable and they are kind to her. They are on top of everything. The food is good, mostly because it's Indian, but not superlative. I love the bollywood music videos and overhearing conversations in the next booth. We have heard many annoying ethnocentric, pseudo-open-minded weirdos here. The staff give me a twilight zone vibe, which is not to say they are bad. They just smile and look upon us for a long time and I don't know how to react to to the small talk. Anyway, this place is good and worthy of a visit. The parking lot is small and you have to drive around the back to exit. One time a car blocked the way and it was a nightmare."}
{"text":"Good food very tasty but need to wait bit more time to get the food. The service is good. Clean and neat ambience"}
{"text":"Eat here about once a week, service is good and the food is great. Do yourself a favor and get the madrasi chicken, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"India Palace is an AMAZING restaurant! 

The food was beyond exceptional. The garlic naan, mango custard and lamb rogan are so very delicious! The spices served were on point. The service was just as great. Vick did an excellent job of helping my friend and I chose the best dishes. He was also incredibly funny and sweet. It's obvious that the owners care about hiring genuine people and serving the best food possible.

I am definitely coming back to India Palace! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon to India Palace and decided to use it last night.

We ordered goat briyani, malai kofta, garlic naan, and mango lassi.

The meal started with the typical papadum and chutneys. The tamarind chutney was pretty decent. I'm not a big fan of tamarind, but this was better than the tamarind chutneys I've tried elsewhere. The mint chutney was also pretty good. They also had a pepper chutney which had a nice kick.

My wife thought the mango lassi was almost as great as at her favorite Indian restaurant.

The garlic naan was good. Not too burnt or chewy which I've found to be the case at many Indian restaurants.

The goat briyani was really good. It had a nice mix of flavors and textures. My wife really liked it until I told her it was goat. (She doesn't like goat and I ordered it while she wasn't listening.)

The briyani came with raita which was decent. 

The malai kofta was also enjoyable. The sauce was very flavorful and the \"vegetable meatballs\" had a nice texture.

The service was pretty slow, but overall it was a good experience, and I think I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"The vegetarian dishes was okay. I did enjoy the cabbage dish and I believe it is called Kutu. Anyway, it was fresh and tasty. The vegetables was cooked perfectly right. Not too soggy and still had a fresh crisp at each bite. 

I didn't eat as much, but I was extremely full right away. I wonder if the myth about buffets is true. You know, the myth of putting something in all of the food that makes you full fast so you don't eat as much and waste any food? Well,  my stomach seems to think that the buffet myth applies to India Palace. It feels like I ate a whole roast pig. I just feel awkwardly bloated and full from eating a few vegetarian dishes. 

I am not sure if I would come back, considering that the lunch buffet is $11.99. The waiter also had poor listening skills.  The bill was 
$25.84.  My friend had $20 Cash and I had a card. We told the waiter to bring back $5 in change and put the rest on the card.  Simple enough right? 

He put $20 into the bill and charged $5.84 on the card! Ay yay yay!!"}
{"text":"My mom and i love their lunch buffet and chai teas!! Always happy good staff and delicious foods!!"}
{"text":"Best new place I've tried in a while,  my girl bought a Groupon here and we tried it,  they have an amazing lunch buffet for 11.95  but we couldn't use Groupon for that,  so I got the house special chicken mahtihka  I think I spelled that right  omg so good,  the rice and the garlic nan  I was in heaven.  Manny our writers was so sweet,  the cutest little buffet Indian guy I've ever seen :) can't wait to come and bring my kids here for the buffet!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time tonight via Amazon and it arrived in less than an hour! We ordered paneer pakora, garlic naan (2 orders), tarka dal (mild spice), chicken tikka masala (medium spice), and rice (1 order). 

I loved their version of paneer pakora and they included dipping sauces (not sure what because they weren't labeled, but they were delicious!). The naan was fluffy and perfectly cooked (not burnt, not hard/stale) and had great flavor. We're not normally huge fans of chicken tikka masala, but it's a safe dish. We thought India Palace's CTM was really good-- not too sweet and not too much cream. The chicken was cubed and tender white meat. The dal was good too; I think next time we order it we will increase the spice level! Maybe you don't care about rice reviews, but the order of rice you receive is large and fresh-- I thought it was worth the price compared to other places I've ordered from around town. 

Overall, lots of flavor and fair portions (we will be having leftovers for dinner tomorrow). I wanted to write this review right away because I didn't want to forget! We're going to order delivery here again soon."}
{"text":"This place is consitient and always a good meal.  For me its a \"standby\".  If my team can't think of anyplace else o go, this is a place we know we can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Drove a little further than we needed to since this restaurant had better reviews than some other Indian places, and we were very glad we did. Very friendly, knowledgeable staff, Indian music videos on one tv, soap operas on another, nice chill ambience. The food was incredible. I got the Chicken Masala and the charbroiled flavour of the tandoor oven was sooooo good. I'm having the leftovers for breakfast right now. Their lassi and raita uses yogurt made in-house. Ever dish we ordered was great, even the basmati rice had some toasted spices in it. They gave us some rice pudding for dessert with strong cardamom flavour, it was very good. We will be back for sure. They were also really knowledgeable about wheat/gluten, assured me the papadums and rice pudding were safe and when they specified another dessert had \"semolina\" it was obvious they knew what they were talking about. I grew up in Vancouver, B.C. with a HUGE Indian population and this is the first great Indian I've had in years."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I have eaten at Indian places all over the western US and I've never had better Indian food than this place. Garry, our waiter, was incredibly nice and gave us fantastic service. Every single dish we have tried is better than any other place here in Vegas. So far we have tried the chicken korma, chicken vindaloo, malai kofta, and the chicken tikka masala and they are all to die for. The meat is cooked perfectly and the sauces are so good you will lap it up from your plate. Give these guys a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"First time here! Simply awesome! Tried the buffet for new taste options. Goat curry is delicious! Rice pudding is perfect dessert with an Indian coffee! My brother had the goat briyani. Very good,  spiced just right! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife was craving Indian food so we went to her favorite Indian restaurant.  I ordered a Taj Mahal beer & free mango lassi with the Yelp check in.  We ordered the following food items: Vegetable samosa, garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, & mixed grilled tandoori.  Everything was excellent as usual.  Our server Garry was very nice and helpful.  I promised to let everyone know that he was the best."}
{"text":"I've tried this place about 6-7 times so far.  Love it!!!
I've tried the lunch buffet here with my family the day after Thanksgiving and take out is great.  The buffet variety is fantastic and different daily.  
My favorite dish here is chicken saag and i always request it extra spicy.  
I love their onion naan and mint chutney.  i also like their raita dressing on salads.  I've always experienced wonderful service here.  They have always been really nice."}
{"text":"I am new to Indian Cusine having had it just once before in London. I was looking for something approaching good Indian food in the Phoenix area, and must say I've found the place. I first called to find out if the restuarant was open as a few other revies had mentioned it had closed. I was pleasantly surprised to hear it was open, as it isn't to far from work. I wanted to order ahead and take out for dinner. When I arrived, the food was done and I was on my way. The place was empty at the time (Wednesday at 5PM) so I was a little nervous, but the food was really good. I had the Chicken Curry and the garlic naan. I would recommend both!"}
{"text":"We made the $10 cab ride from LINQ to this place last night, and it was definitely worth it. We are connoisseurs of Indian food, and India Palace is fantastic. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, naan, and dal soup. Rich flavors and great service. (We could do without the Indian MTV on the televisions, though.)"}
{"text":"Just a small warning - this place while close to the Strip is not located in an ideal location. The surroundings look run down, and we saw some not so pleasant people hanging around in the neighborhood.

We visited on thanksgiving day for lunch buffet. Being from SF Bay Area we are used to a large selection in buffets and were disappointed to see very few options. But the saving grace was that most dishes in the buffet tasted good. The prices were reasonable and the service was decent. I would go back for lunch when in LV but would not go there at night."}
{"text":"Went here because we had bought a coupon off of LivingSocal.com. First the service was lacking. There was only two other tables seated yet it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us.  The food was mediocre tasting. The chickpeas were hard in the channa masala, the chicken tikka masala tasted burned and the shrimp in the shrimp kadahi was overcooked.  We ordered the food spicy and I found the food to be bland with just spice (heat). We did complain about the chicken tikka masala and they did switch it out for us.  The worst of it all was that they didn't accept the Livingsocial voucher. The manager gave us some lame excuse and claimed that he had a sign up stating that. It wasn't up that night for us to see. Frustrating!  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I just tried this place today...it was delicious.  I bought a groupon for it!  We had some of the vegetarian options on hand...totally authentic and delicious...Great service too!"}
{"text":"I ive been to other Indian Buffets before, but I always seem to gravitate to this place. I'm in love with their spinach dish. Staff and environment is very nice. I wish I knew more about Indian Food and knew exactly what I was eating. All I know is that I now love Indian Food and this place helped introduce me to it."}
{"text":"It was not love at first sight for my friend Indian Food and myself. In fact, we hated one another pretty good in the beginning. All of that changed after my first experience at India Palace. To be honest, I've only eaten at two Indian Restaurants in my life. After eating here, I'm not sure I will venture elsewhere. 

So on a lonely afternoon my wife and I decided to ditch our co-workers and meet for lunch. Fortunately India Palace had a Yelp dealio going down where you get $30 of grub for $20, a stellar deal. No restrictions were mentioned upon purchase, however when I presented the coupon the server said it was only valid for dinner. After explaining there were no restrictions mentioned in the disclaimer or at the time of purchase he graciously accepted the coupon and we enjoyed their lunch buffet with two refreshing pepsi-cola beverages. I'm a huge fan of their tandoori chicken, but the meal wouldn't be complete without their piping hot, freshly baked nan. I could honestly make a meal just out of that. My favorite item at the buffet is the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is tandoori chicken marinated in yogurt & spices in a creamy tomato sauce. It's 8:45am and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I even enjoyed a serving of their creamy spinach, Popeye would be proud.

The service at India Palace is always exceptional. The servers are friendly and attentive, your drink never stays empty for long, plates are whooshed away at lightening speed upon completion, and I always leave here feeling good about my experience and reminded as to why I've never gone to any other Indian restaurant. 5 glowing stars!"}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles and we have many good Indian Restaurants and this is right up there with the best. Their menu featured dishes that I had not eaten before and everything was delicious. If anyone is going to Las Vegas for great food give this a try. It's a must."}
{"text":"India place is one of the finest restaurants las vegas has. India place gives you a taste of the official indian food, it has top class service, amazing deserts, my favorite the mango custard (which by the way you HAVE to taste) india place also has great catering service. over all if your in vegas you have to go and eat at india place you will have an great experience."}
{"text":"110% the best Indian place in vegas. Food is delicious and always perfection. Portion sizes are just right for sharing with plenty of meat and veggies where other places skimp and give you a trough of sauce with 3 or 4 pieces of chicken. Papadam and sauces are complimentary. Get the butter chicken and narvartan Korma with paneer. You won't be sorry"}
{"text":"Awesome! First the smells were amazing when I walked into the doors. Then the food was just as delicious as the smells!!"}
{"text":"We finally found some good Indian food in the North Phoenix area!  The staff is so pleasant and helpful.  We enjoyed the samosas, chicken tikka masala, chicken saag and garlic naan."}
{"text":"Overall this place is excellent!! The food is spectacular!! There are many great food options for vegetarians as well which I found very nice, so thank you!!! On the night we were in they were very busy so service was a little slow but, they were very hospitable and that more than made up for it for us! I found that this place is a place that is like a hidden gem in Vegas. It may not be in such a great part of town but, trust me it's well worth every second...great food, bar, wine selection, vegetarian options, great people who work there, a place we will definitely be returning to again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  I know this is coming from a white boy, but after living in Chicago and SF, India Palace is among the best I've had.  Portions are large, so you'll probably end up taking some home.  There were three of us, had samosas and three entrees, and took enough home to eat for lunch the next day.  Great service, great food, great atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food was great! Service was slow even though we and another party were the only ones in the restaurant, there couldn't have been more than 8 people seated. This was a few minutes after the lunch buffet closed and before the dinner rush. Nonetheless, I loved their goat curry and mango lassi. My sister and cousin ordered chicken entrees which were really good. This place had the best mango lassi I've had in a long time. The food was 5 stars, service was maybe a 3. I would come again though."}
{"text":"Pleasing and gentle people serving delicious food in a relaxing setting.  This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"If ur looking for indian food in Vegas, this is the place to go. Food and Service was good. We ordered the goat briyani, Chicken Manchuri and garlic naan. First 2 items were delicious, but i personally felt the naan to be little dry but my husband thought it was perfect so i guess overall we both enjoyed our dinner here very much. Nyammy!"}
{"text":"closed!!!!!!

EDIT: 20100716: Wait a minute. This place is still open! I think they must have closed for some renovations - went there today and it's definitely open for business with buffet and everything. Didn't look like it was renovated either. Please ignore my previous indication of it being closed. Still one of the better buffet on the west side, too. Looks like they got a new website.."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had since living in India! Amazingly friendly waitstaff, fresh ingredients, and the spices were out of this world mouth watering good!

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for REAL Indian food experience."}
{"text":"Awesome food... Great ambience. 5 star.  Manny was just great with awesome service !!"}
{"text":"Alright so, I'm not Indian. I don't really know what \"authentic\" is. But, I will say this. I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants in Vegas and California, and India Palace remains number 1 to me. This place is so. damn. good. 

Also, just to throw this out there, I work with many Indian people, and they really like this place a lot as well. Take that information as you will, but, I think it's a good thing. 

I've been coming here for a very long time and I'm friendly with the staff. They are SO polite and friendly. I have always felt very welcomed here since the beginning. 

The food, let's just talk about the food. It's amazing. My favorite being of course the chicken mahkani (butter chicken). It's easily one of my favorite things to eat, ever. They bring you naan bread to the table with an option of regular of garlic. Always go with the garlic, it's not very overwhelming. 

I also do the buffet every time I come here. I've eaten here for dinner twice and while I really do love the food, I feel their dinner portions are rather small when compared to the price. One of these times I used a Groupon and was never met with any kind of negativity, so it's weird to me that people are mentioning that. And as far as the rest of the service, I've never had issues with being neglected service or having my water filled, even when they're busy and hosting a party. 

Anyway, the buffet is great because you get a sampling of a lot of different things for a low price which is never a bad thing. 

Also, I give it a 4 star rating because as much as I love the food, I really hate driving here. It's in a not so lovely part of town and the parking here is a nightmare when they're busy.

Try it for lunch sometime, of course with a mango lassi."}
{"text":"This was the fourth restaurant we tried... turns out the other 3 had gone out of business. With two starving children, we picked the first one we found... India Palace.  Turns out, it was the best thing that could have happened.  The wait staff was really friendly and patient with the kids and the food was amazing.  I ordered Chicken Tika Masala and it was hands down the best I have ever eaten.  Just for that, I give this restaurant 5 stars.  Everyone else in the party was also really pleased with their meals.  One word of caution, the portions are untraditionally large.  We all came home with half of our meals!  This place may not look like much from the outside but it is a hidden jewel."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food. The only possible downside is no samosa for buffet. Staff is friendly, the place is clean and the food is superb"}
{"text":"Awesome food and the best service ever. Highly recommend this place for indian food. The staff is well mannered and make you feel like home."}
{"text":"I got there right before they closed not realizing it. Not only did they stay open, they were super friendly and welcoming. The food, awesome! Super flavorful and full of spice like I'm used to. They brought a large basket of naan to the table as well. Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Indian restaurant. The food is always fresh and very tasty, the portions are very generous and the staff are always so helpful with our gluten free requests. We have had two new Indian restaurants open closer to our home, but neither can compare to India Palace."}
{"text":"we got the rack of lamb dinner - without knowing that it was enough for two people, we also ordered this masala dosa or whatever you call it (a huge crepe looking thing stuffed with potatoes and onions).  the lamb was delicious! and the rest of the food was just ok.
i am curious about their lunch buffet - probably would go try it sometime, but don't think i will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"The food was good. I had keema nann, samosa, and a keema curry. It all tasted great. I thought the service was a bit rude and lazy.  I was standing out in front of my hotel waiting for them. I missed one call from the driver (who was not there yet) because my phone only rang once. I then got a nasty text from the manager saying he tried to reach me multiple times to say they were on the way.  I called them back to say I was already out front waiting (even though they said they would just call when they got there). When the driver arrived he did not even bother getting out of his car. He just honked his horn at me to come over and handed me my good threw the passenger window. I did not even have a chance to top them."}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala was honestly the best I've ever had. The sauce was smooth and perfectly spiced. The cheese naan was very light and soft and perfectly paired the masala.The only complaint was that the masala didn't come with rice."}
{"text":"Upon arrival I was surprised that there weren't tumble weeds blowing across the floor or the distant sound of crickets because it was a ghost town.  So expect to feel like you're being watched. The decor was a little much, but I guess it was \"modern\". ALSO, the food is not great as others may have said. I am a VEGETARIAN REVIEWER, so I got the veggie korma and a mushroom dish.  the veggie korma wasn't anything exciting. though the cheese cubes were not bad there were massive pieces of cauliflower and the most prevalent flavor was peas.......little spice.....no flavor......and the mushroom dish was terrible....but the roti was good and the service was awesome, yet these dishes made my insides hate me and I recommend that you should be wary once entering the ghost town of India Palace."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food always taste great and the survive is friendly every time I come.  This place has never been a thing but outstanding. It one of the few places I can get my brother to go and he is picky. Come for lunch and get a open selection or come for dinner and pick a favorite. Either way it will be great."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian meal and good service.  I would go back if I could stay longer in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch Buffet! Honestly best Indian lunch in all of Vegas. I lived in India for 2 months and this place is authentic North Indian cuisine and vibe. The location is in a somewhat rowdy area but once inside you feel like your in New Delhi . 

One thing the restaurant needs to work on is  better customer Service. It may be a  cultural difference between India and US but water refills , timeliness and politeness are what makes a big difference for the dining experience -- no matter how good the food and price ...

{"text":"- Good food, Paneer entree was really really good. Dal was good as well
- Great service, packed our food really well.
- Clean
Host was gracious. Lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Our dinner was delicious and the service was prompt and friendly.  They were happy to make suggestions and answer questions too, which was very helpful. Order the cold Indian tea and the Kheer for dessert, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"When the smiley hostess comes to you and asks \"Do you want bread?\" Your answer should always be \"yes please!\" About the food, it's all delicious! Great flavors, hot, fresh, and really good! I have not had much Indian food but this is definitely on top of the list. The selection could absolutely be better but what they got to offer is made with great quality, specially the lamb... And here's where the bread comes handy. The sauce is right on point, and the bread makes it all the perfect bite. I don't know if I was just hungry, or if today was just a good cook day... But I hope they keep it up, and be ready for a repeat when I come back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the dishes at the buffet, especially the lamb curry and the dal. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Very nice and fast service but the foot wasn't that great would recommend tandoori times instead. Sorry"}
{"text":"Restaurant was nice looking inside for a small place. Service was slow and it wasn't so busy. Food was OK. Maybe Indian food is just not our thing. The mango lassi drink was delicious at least."}
{"text":"GET the Rogan Josh! Had dinner here with a couple of close friends. I'm glad my buddy recommended this spot because we had quite an Indian feast."}
{"text":"Service was terrible never got to the food part. Only the papadums and that too made my kid get good poisoning. We waited for 2 hours for our food and when we got up to ask the manager started arguing with us instead of apologizing for his incompetence for running the place. Worst of all we came to know about this place through family friends. They discriminate against Indians even though it's an indian restaurant. Would never go back. And do not suggest any one visiting Vegas to there either plenty of other options"}
{"text":"To get off the strip is a PLEASURE and this place is a beacon of light; some of the best Indian food I have personally ever eaten.  Everyone in our party of 4 had the same response."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Nice atmosphere.  Delicious food.  Good service.  Easy parking in front.  Reasonably priced.  I am recommending this place to my friends."}
{"text":"I've eaten at my fair share of Indian restaurants. That said, casual or fine dining, this place is by far the best. Service was quick without being rushed, prices are reasonable, good beer, and the food is delicious! Great for vegetarians and vegans- We had the Paneer Tikka Masala, Bhindi Masala, Navratan Korma, and Garlic Naan. All, so far the best I've had in Las Vegas. 
The location leaves something to be desired but the interior of this quaint and clean restaurant along with the amazing food makes that easily disregard-able. I'll definitely be back soon and often."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas in March and I bought a Groupon for this restaurant. The food was amazing. Garlic Naan were buttery soft and tasty. We had ordered Malai Kofta and Paneer Tikka, both of the dishes were very tasty, the quantity was good also. It is not too far from the Strip. We walked from Wynn but I would not recommend walking late at night, take the car. But overall great food, I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to in Arizona. Love there buffet. We travel over 40 miles to go to this restaurant. I would definitely recommend this to anyone living/coming to AZ."}
{"text":"What I liked about this place was that it was not as greasy as most Indian restaurants in the U.S.  Unfortunately, the flavors were somewhat bland.  Palak paneer was average.  Naan was ok.  Vegetable pakora was good."}
{"text":"Their food reminds me of my childhood. Grew up eating Indian food daily and I love it all. I've been on a curry binge lately and late night or lunch time at work I'll come to them and get reminded why I come back everytime. Thank you for the great service."}
{"text":"Just ate at the India Palace and wow! Tandoori chicken was moist and delicious, chicken tikka masala was maybe the best I've ever tasted and the curry was perfect. Top it off with great naan bread and unbelievable service from Manny and the result is my first yelp review ever. I've had Indian food in various countries to include England and countries very close to India and this is in the top 2 ever."}
{"text":"Well prepared authentic Indian food available at a very convenient location. I ordered online and selected pick up option.
The food was ready on time,
Well packed and disposable crockery and cutlery were provided

Value for money"}
{"text":"I have been eating at India Palace for years and I have not been disappointed. After trying a few other Indian restaurants in town I have returned here every time. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and all of the items I have tried have been delicious. Their lunch buffet is very reasonably priced and a great way for people who aren't quite comfortable navigating the full menu.

The uncomfortable feeling you experience when pulling up to this location will quickly subside once you get inside. The building itself is much nicer than it was when I started going five years ago.

Bottom line, I have not been to or heard of a better Indian restaurant in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is okayish... North Indian snacks like Aloo Chat, Samosa chat are tasty, However Dosa, Uthampam, Sambar can be rated as average. Ordered Chicken Biryani with spice level 8 and its not spicy, I should have ordered 10. This being a North Indian restaurant, the biryani style is different than that of Hyderabad Biryani.  Lassi is the best thing they have. Its 10 min Drive from Strip and have ample parking."}
{"text":"We love Indian food and have had it many times. I normally steer away from a lunch buffett, but we decided to give it a try. 9.99 per person without a drink. Everything we had was super fresh. The Buffett is open until 3 pm and we arrived at 1:30. Often the food has been sitting out under a heating lamp. Not at all the story here. Several times we saw new fresh food brought out. They had all of the classic favorites such as chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, lentils, lamb meatballs, vegetable korma, tandoori chicken, etc. some of the best we have ever had. Even the naan was excellent, fresh out of the oven and perfect. The cilantro chutney was delicious too! 

Service was friendly and very attentive!

The place was very full for a Saturday afternoon at 1:30. I was a bit surprised, but we were in and out in 45 minutes and super full. 

Now some of the chairs were a bit worn, a few scratches on the walls, but we love mom and pop places that serve great food. They have definitely tried to decorate it nicely, very clean. 

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Never had Indian food before. Had the buffet and each dish was a unique surprise! Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and I eat it fairly often but this place has hands down the best chicken makhani. I ordered the basmati rice, the garlic naan, and the chicken makhani and that was well enough food for two people. The flavors of everything was incredible and I'm actually really sad I'm only in Vegas for the weekend because I'd eat here weekly if I could."}
{"text":"With all the selections of themed places (yuk) I wanted tom find a nice mom and pop in a sea of coyote ulgies. This one looked good and I am very happy to report it lived up to it's recommendations. I had some nan bread and chicken curry and it was great. Seemed like a clean tidy place and the staff was very friendly and attentive. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with our colleagues from India and everyone was happy.  Good food, reasonable prices, and fast service."}
{"text":"Good ambiance and service. 
Vegetarian options are okay.
Price is reasonable, place is bit away from strip. Wouldn't recommend walking."}
{"text":"Neither of us is of Indian descent, but we absolutely love Indian food, and we've had it most places we travel to.  I think we've tried every single Indian restaurant in Toronto proper (some in the burbs, but there are probably a billion of them scattered in strip malls we haven't yet discovered), and out of all of them, our favourite is India Palace.  Now, I consider myself a foodie, but not a food snob, so I am not above reviewing places with excellent all-you-can-eat buffets.  I agree that you will often (in fact, more often than not) notice a degraded quality of food at most AYCE places, but I can't stand it when people are so snooty or closed-minded that they dismiss them all out of hand.  Case in point, Indian buffets.

With the significant East Indian/Pakistani population in Toronto, it's inevitable that we would get a great variety of really well done Indian eateries, from all points on the spectrum, from hole-in-the-wall to 5-star.

India Palace, as far as decor, size and layout is concerned, lies somewhere in between, as are most other Indian places near it (Trimurti, Little India, Dhaba, Kama, Babur, all of which we've eaten at multiple times to give them a fair shake).

But average looks can be deceiving.  The place has extremely friendly and welcoming waitstaff who'll greet you with a smile, a handshake and friendly conversation, especially if they notice you on a return visit, your drinks are refreshed diligently, and the food is excellent!

We have been here for a la carte meals, and they are great, but where they really shine is their lunch buffet.  As long as you follow a few simple rules (here's where I think some of the more negative reviewers have gone wrong):

- arrive early - we often get there just as they open, usually at 11:30am, they may not have their full spread out quite yet, but it's the only time to go, when everything is fresh and unsullied by the barbarian hordes who think nothing of dropping things all over the place.  Also, they won't have made their first batch of buttery Naan yet, so they'll apologize for that then bring out the first few pieces right to your table


- pace yourself, and try a tiny bit of everything they have that day before committing to a proper plate of food - be open-minded, some of my favourite dishes there are ones I would not have pegged as personal faves upon arrival

- as far as actual food goes, their vegetarian options are better than the meat ones (although, their butter chicken is the bomb - rich and savoury, with substantial pieces of properly tandoori'd boneless chicken - unlike the majority of competing places where the gravy is thin to the point of being pink water or the meat is shredded beyond recognition).  you absolutely must try the Bengain Bartha (eggplant) and the Saag Paneer.  These three dishes alone put all the neighbouring restaurant buffets to shame.

And, as mentioned by others, this place is extremely affordable.  So, don't make the mistake of thinking that every restaurant on this stretch of Queen are made equal, they're not - the only one that's comparable is Babur, and sadly, they made the decision to move upscale and do away with their buffet years ago (I remember when they were one of the only games in town with a place up on Dundas).  India Palace rocks!"}
{"text":"Food was good! But the service was typical indian. (Not the best) 
Would definitely recommend if you are close by and want to eat indian food."}
{"text":"India palace closed for a few months to renovate....a few very sad months for some friends and I ...

It completely changed its decor---completely modern now--and the lighting SO much better.

Food is still excellent and I will come back every chance I get."}
{"text":"Ok, so I came back again and had deplorable service. The good food wasn't good enough for the slow, in attentive and at times rude staff. Not to mention a side of regular, plain rice is $4."}
{"text":"What an awesome place. Ricky was awesome. owner was fantastic. We will be back for sure!!!! The food was really good, the place was clean and the staff was very attentive!"}
{"text":"Always excellent service and food. Had the Tandoori chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala. Generous portions and flavorful. My favorite place for Indian food in Arizona."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying the lunch buffet here for years.  The food and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant In Las Vegas. Great curries and chicken tikka is a must. Small so make reservation. Very fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"BEST Indian food evvvvveeeerrrr! Had to wait a little bit for the food to come out of the kitchen but COMPLETELY WORTH IT! Such a great surprise to find this amazing gem. Will definitely be returning soon to try the buffet."}
{"text":"The food is good, but don't bother trying to get delivery from them. The last three times they cancelled my order. FIrst they didn't have a driver, then they \"had a flat tire\". I don't know their excuse for the third time. They are currently on GrubHub and Eat24. Not ordering from them again."}
{"text":"My new favorite go to Indian restaurant. They offer papadom, Indian crackers which are gluten free. The madrasi lamb was delicious but I should have asked for a spice level of hot. The basmati rice had good flavor. They offer more of the authentic Indian dishes.

If you are fortunate to come on a night when they offer goat curry, do yourself a favor and try it. The best I have had."}
{"text":"Greeted by expressionless waiter who banged our glasses and plates down on our table. He poured water without even looking and didn't respond to our thank you's. The next waiter couldn't decide whether to be nice to us or not. He smiled the first time and made snide remarks the next. The third guy was visibly relieved when we didn't order dessert. All this when we arrived well before time and someone else had just started ordering when we were leaving. The food was so-so. We ordered Dosa and frankly, there's a lot of room for improvement. Would not recommend going there. There are other better indian restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"This place is out of this world. The food was adorned in the most beautiful dishes. We highly recommend  this \"Place\" to anyone wanting a good time and great food."}
{"text":"Ok..so were from San francisco, which arguably has the best cuisine in the u.s. So this may be a bit biased. 
The food is not that great...we went for the buffet and it was really bland. 

But there were a lot of Indian and bangladeshis in the place, which makes me think it must be the only game in town."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE but good food. Pretty pricy for curry. If you wanna see the most unfriendly servers, this is the place to go. I will never go back there, tho."}
{"text":"Don't let the neighborhood scare you. Everything we have tried is delicious and the servers are friendly. The lunch buffet is a great price with lots of choices.  I wish  we lived closer so we could go more often."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS. The cuisine at the buffet is the same as if you ordered a fresh plate of food. It was seasoned appropriately and full of flaver. I was amazed by the prompt service and the high quality of the food available. That cilantro chutney was to die for! The restaurant itself was very clean and dim which I liked since I was looking to relax somewhere in a corner and enjoy my food. I actually can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Except Idly and Veg Rolls, nothing else is good here. Guess what, the buffet charge is $35 for a couple and it is not even $10 worth. So, definitely would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"*Review for lunch buffet only

I think India Palace is akin to the Kevin Bacon of Indian buffet restaurants since a google search for \"India Palace restaurant\" will yield one in virtually every state across the US despite not representing a franchise of any sort.  Yet the prevalence of Indian restaurants bearing this particular name is as longstanding and prolific as the consistent film career that spawned Kevin Bacon's namesake movie trivia game.  

The various elements sampled and experienced on my first time visit displayed a versatility much like the individual character performances that has made Kevin Bacon ubiquitous across the cinematic landscape:

Splashing debut (\"Animal House\")-As a fraternity pledge that captured Hollywood's attention, the free mango lassi with checkin on Yelp will be sure to capture yours

Over-the-top (\"Footloose\")- Like his rebellious city teen persona Ren McCormack, enjoy racy song and dance numbers with Bollywood films playing on an endless loop amongst TV screens in the background while you eat.

Solid/reliable supporting actor (\"Mystic River\"/\"A Few Good Men\")- not necessarily the leading role like a Sean Penn or a Tom Cruise,  but the mini samosas are a solid appetizer with the right ratio of filling to dough enhanced with a few drizzles of tamarind and mint chutney. 

Chillingly good performance (\"Sleepers\")- availability of chaat in the cold section of the buffet line 

Overdone (\"Hollow Man\")- As scientist Sebastian Caine, \"Yeah! If I die, pretend the last words I said were real deep and clever.\"  If I'm hungry, I'll pretend the tandoori chicken was not dry and overcooked 

Lukewarm(\"Picture Perfect\")- a performance as uninspiring as the the saag paneer with an unattractive layer of oil floating on top

Risky(\"Tremors\")- mixed reviews from critics regarding his role in this subtle comedy/sci-fi thriller, but reminds me of the risk one partakes in consuming the fruit in the salad bar since I'd be afraid of any underground postprandial \"rumblings\" within one's GI tract.

Ridiculous (\"The Air Up There\")- the presence of macaroni and cheese and chicken nuggets on the buffet line is as preposterous as the plot of this movie starring Kevin Bacon as a college basketball coach venturing deep into Africa to pursue a tribesman whom he discovered while watching a home movie...words fail.   

If you're a newbie to Indian cuisine, the fare at India Palace provides a good primer to classic Indian restaurant fare, but for a seasoned veteran, my top choices in town would still be Mt. Everest and Delhi Cuisine.   Kevin Bacon once summed up his career with the quote \"I think of myself more as a workhorse actor. It will be hot and cold and up and down, but no one will kick me out of the business\"  Pretty much sums up how I feel about this establishment."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. It is back in the corner of the plaza, and potentially easy to miss while driving by. Boyfriend and I came in about 11:45 am Sunday looking for some lunch. After brief deliberation we decided to do the lunch buffet. 

We tried a little (or a lot) of everything they had out. They also provided a basket of naan, which was refilled when we were out at no additional charge. All the food was hot (minus the cold/dessert items, of course) and tasted good. 

The women working that day were extremely pleasant and helpful to us in making a decision on what to have. Neither of us are experts on Indian food, so it was great to have someone willing to explain what everything was and make suggestions. They were also very good about making sure we had enough to drink and promptly removed our empty plates when we had finished our food. The inside is kept very clean and is nicely decorated.

Not sure what the people are talking about who said this place was closed -- it is definitely still open. 

The only annoyance/confusion we had was navigating through the parking lot, which had large sections closed off for resurfacing. This is obviously only a temporary situation so it's no big deal."}
{"text":"Great indian lunch buffet!

Shorter lineup than the neighbors, but that has no bearing on the quality. The staff is fantastic and the selection of items is great. Best vegetarian and fish selection among the other lunch buffets on the strip. 

Everything was great and fresh and they make sure to turnaround quickly for the business crowd."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a good recipe of spoiling people's mood and vacation. This restaurant doesn't know how to treat it's customers!!! We called the restaurant 5 minutes before getting in to ask about the time for last orer and went there with plenty time at hand. When we reach there we were completely ignored for 7-8 minutes despite multiple tables being empty and making eye with the manager several times. When we finally literally stood in front of him,he asked us to go to any table. At the table, the manager comes up to us and says that we will only give you buffets. When we clarified that we just called before getting in that they will accept orders, he started saying that last order means we shut down!!! Seriously!!!! Check what last order means!!! And he was like this is what we mean and you can go talk to the owner. That's what the manager is saying and all of it pretty rude. After we spoke to the boss and we were seated, we were looking forward to having some south Indian food. Guess what, the waiter just comes to us and says we are not serving south Indian!!! They are really ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the service. These guys are great! Easy to talk to  they explain any questions you ask thoroughly and they are fast. The chicken tikka masala is the best I've had but please try the keema naan if you like lamb and the kashmiri naan- probably misspelled. They have music videos in the background and its not too loud but adds too the environment. Really fun really tasty and affordable!"}
{"text":"Have been here thrice, always for their lunch buffet. The price is decent and the food is awesome. Their food is not too oily and they bring really fresh bread to your table. The ambience and the music is a nice touch too.

The mango pudding is so freaking delicious it takes you straight to heaven."}
{"text":"We came here with the intention of getting take out. We were greeted by Vick who was very friendly and helpful. He offered suggestions on drink and appetizer while waiting.  His cheerful demeanor won us over and we decided to dine in. 
The restaurant was very clean, his service was excellent and the food was very good. 
Vick makes excellent suggestions for food choices. 
Based on the area the restaurant is in we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of service we received. 
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We ordered numerous dishes and ate family style. Once again, the food was amazing! We discovered Hayward's 5000 beer, which was a little sweet, and perfect with the spicy currie. Our waiter, Vick, was very personable and helpful with the menu! Will be back soon:)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located not in a very busy side of time. They did have a lot of varieties, but nothing was really outstanding or memorable. I did like that they have a lot of vegetarian items though. The interior design of the restaurant and the service was ok."}
{"text":"If I have to sum up the food and experience at this restaurant in one word, it would be 'hideous'. The food here is not even remotely Indian and is grossly incompetent. I had the afternoon buffet and most of the food items were as cold as ice. The service was equally poor. It's sad to see people selling low grade food and call it 'Indian food'. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Indian cuisine and I even cook it at home.  I have tried my fair share of Indian restaurants and this one lands at the top of the list with the likes of Amber in San Jose, CA.  

The tikka masala, benghan barta and other dishes my colleagues ordered were all excellent including the onion kulcha.  The only thing that was ok was the rice pudding dessert.  I have had better elsewhere.

All in all I can't wait to come back to Vegas and have dinner here again.  If you're an Indian food fan, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"Double Date night and we thought Indian would be a good choice.
The India Palace reviews, over all seemed pretty good so away we went.

The food was really good. We stayed mostly with the \"house favorites\" listed on the menu. I always feel these are the restaurant's recommendations and a good place to statrt. Chicken Marsala, Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tandori, etc. All was really good. The Nan was amazing, Onion & Garlic. Yum!

The service was super attentive, and quick. Easy behind strip location, right down Sahara to Twain. 

And would I go back, Fo'Sure"}
{"text":"Went their last night! We got there 20 min. before opening. The nice lady still let us in and turned their sign to open.
Super delicious! I had the coconut lamb and my husband the vindaloo. He was super excited to finally receive something hot and spicy.
We also gotvtge Safran rice and Naan bread. Delicious. Even my Mango lassi was amazing.
The food was great! The service great! The restaurant was nice and clean. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had a hankering for Indian food and had been meaning to try India Palace. I grabbed a friend and we headed on our way. 

As others have said, the neighborhood is a bit sketchy. The restaurant is nice inside and looks recently renovated. The staff was extremely friendly and seated us right away. 

The food is good. Really good. They immediately brought us papadum and a few various sauces. We ordered some garlic naan (delicious) and the Bombay fish (decent).

We ordered chicken tikka masala and Reshami chicken along with two orders of basmati rice. I ordered the tikka masala as spicy as they make it. It was spicy but, I wanted tears and didn't get any. It was still delicious. It's the best Indian food I've had in Las Vegas during the 5 years I've lived here.

Great service, great atmosphere, and great food. Go!"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times over the last several years and I've never been disappointed.  My husband doesn't like Indian food, so I don't get to go often enough.

I always get palak paneer, and it is done very well here.  I order it with minimal spiciness and the flavors still come through beautifully without being salty.  I also had garlic naan which is seasoned perfectly.

My friend got the mixed curry dinner, and all dishes were good, but their chicken tikka masala is OUTSTANDING.  I got an extra one to go with some garlic naan to share with my family.

The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy, but I've never had any problems.  (It's a block east from Paradise which is a busier street.)  I wouldn't let that deter me from trying this gourmet Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Got far more than my money's worth when it comes to the lunch buffet. Eating all around India, I honestly feel like I'm back in Northern India again eating here. Whoever seasons the food here definitely cares about what their serving."}
{"text":"A must stop whenever I get to town.  Awesome food all around I have pretty much covered there entire menu and always had a stellar meal. If you like buffets the buffet is always top notch and a deal at $9.99."}
{"text":"I LOVE India Palace! Best Indian place to eat in my own humble opinion.   

BUT. I suggest you to try their lunch buffets before you decide for yourself. They have goat curry, which is total awesomeness. Their garlic Naan bread is the best I've ever tasted in my entire life. They bring it out all fresh too!  The staffs are SUPER sweet. 

I wouldn't eat dinner there though....especially if you are a girl... This restaurant is located at a pretty shady area.  If you really want to come at night, you should bring pepper spray and/or a taser with you.

I also wouldn't come here if you're a vegetarian. The veggie dishes taste and look boring to me...Sorry. I focus on meat. 

Parking sucks also. Don't park there if they have a truck there to restock their kitchen. Being the Asian female driver I am...I couldn't back out my car. So....a waiter had to do it for me. Yes. I know. Very embarrassing....."}
{"text":"Best indian food in vegas !!!
Ordered daal tadka, bhindi and chicken tikka. Everything was awesome."}
{"text":"Always a favorite when it comes to Lunch Buffet! This time we were served by Manny and Roy. They were very attentive, polite and professional while serving the family. Thanks for keeping up your standards. The bathroom was spotless! The only thing I need to bring up is the high chair. It needs new buckle. Please send this suggestion to the management. I appreciate it."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC... I've been coming here now for 5+ years and I've never been disappointed here. EVER.

The owner/manager is an incredibly nice man who you can tell cares a lot about his restaurant & patrons.

YES, the food is amazing... I actually think of this place at least once a week... I have an unhealthy obsession with the sweet & spicy Indian Pickles that are served at the lunch buffet...

After trying basically every good Indian & Pakistani restaurant in T.O., There's only 2 places I'll go to - India Palace & Lahore Tikka House.

India Palace WILL NOT disappoint!!!!"}
{"text":"This Indian Buffett is my most favorite in Phoenix because of the quality of the food, lamb dishes and nice clean open restaurant. Steaming hot, fresh and high quality gives this place 5 stars but I deducted one for its smaller Buffett. They do not have soups or different kinds of rice. But even with that the quality makes it better than other places in Phoenix. I have only seen equal in Tempe and Denver Co. I go twice a week!"}
{"text":"Soooo amazing! Our waitress was very helpful and patient with all of our questions. We have never bought Indian Food before so for all of you out there excited and nervous with all of the options, this is the place to go! Every item on the menu had a description with all the ingredients and I don't think you go wrong with anything! We are coming back with our whole family this Sunday for the buffet to try as much as we can!"}
{"text":"Looking for the best Indian restaurant in town?  This is it!  No matter what you order, you won't be disappointed. Their meat (beef, chicken or lamb) is cooked perfectly. Usually when restaurants serve chunks of meat, they are always overcooked and dry, but not at India Palace -- they are always cooked to order and juicy. And no matter which sauce you choose, the depth of flavor will wow you.  This is not just another ethnic restaurant, this is a gourmet experience; you can taste the chef's love in every bite. And their prices are very reasonable.  Tonight we ordered Makhani Chicken, Lamb Boti Masala, Paratha Aloo Nan, and hot Chai tea.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"When I tell you this is the best most authentic Indian restaurant I mean it. Best part is it is a family run place and they truly go out of their way to make sure your experience is amazing.  Now let's talk about the food.... Aaaaammmaazzzinnngg!!!! I crave it when I am not here, and bring everyone I know!!! Great environment and good portion sizes... Let's not forget the chai iced tea!!! I love all the employees in here!"}
{"text":"While not inedible, I don't think the flavors were at all authentic. We tried the chicken curry, eggplant, vegetable korma and tandoori chicken. Of these, the chicken tandoori and v. Korma were best. The nan was decent. The food, even at medium, is not at all spicy."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here while visiting friends in PHX. India Palace is obviously family-owned and operated. The service was quick and attentive but not annoyingly so. The food was excellent and true to descriptions on the menu. We were asked what spice level we wanted and the results were accurate. We ordered three chicken dishes: tandoori, mushroom and curry with coconut along with garlic naan and a deep-fried onion appetizer (can't remember the name). ALL were delicious! The entire meal was less than $46 for three adults (with no drinks). My friends who live near the restaurant will definitely return and I plan at least one visit there the next time I'm in Phoenix. It was definitely a hit with us!!"}
{"text":"First Timers

This was my first time to India Palace and I was excited based on all the positive reviews I had read . As you walk into the India Palace you noticd the decor is very nice, the restaurant is well lit for the low light atmosphere, and the  music and dance videos are entertaining as you dine. 

The staff at India Palace are very knowledgeable and helpful.  They were more than happy to assist us with selecting entrees based on our preferences. On this visit we decided to have the lunch buffet. The buffet at India Palace is very moderately priced, and offeres good options for both the Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian eaters. 

All our entrees were very good. The curry chicken, tikka masala, daal tarka, tandoori chicken,  rice, and desserts were all very flavorful, tender, and fresh. However,  I think my favorite item was the hot fresh naan. You are served hot fresh naan at your table and after my second round I was asked if I would like to taste the garlic naan! Heck yes. The regular naan was great thin, soft, and tasty but the garlic naan was so delicious. If you visit India Pakace you have to try the ice tea-just a hint of cinnamon in it, very refreshing.

If you find yourself in the area of India Palace you should stop by he won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Been there many times, food is great also service, there buffet has a large variety of foods from north of India."}
{"text":"Apart from the mediocre food, the service is worst. They don't honor yelp deals. Definitely a place to avoid."}
{"text":"We were attracted to the rave reviews that India Palace has gotten through Yelp. We were staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and had our own rental car so decided to drive out to India Palace for a quick dinner. Unfortunately we couldn't even taste any of the food that the reviewers on Yelp raved about.
We made  an Open Table reservation and got to the restaurant on time. We were immediately greeted by a person without any expressions (no problem) and without any knowledge of what Open Table was (no problem here either). We were seated immediately............... AND THEN............AND THEN........ NOTHING.... FOR A LONG TIME NOTHING.
Then came along our server. Brought the traditional Pappads and Chutneys and water and GONE.... AND THEN ... AND THEN..... MORE OF NOTHING.
He returned once again and without asking whether we wanted something to drink, he stated, \"So what do you want?\". We ordered some Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Seekh Kababs etc and ............. THEN WAITED...... NOTHING. NO ONE.
At that point I was done and questioning myself on leaving the fine dining available on the Strip and chasing this place out. We walked outta there angry and frustrated. Drove right back to the Cosmopolitan Hotel and had a Steak dinner.
This experience killed the whole desire of having Indian food in Las Vegas. The rest of the days that we were in Vegas we saw several options to have some Indian food however we second guessed ourselves and ate where we knew it was good."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times, and each and every time I still really enjoy it. Manny was the waiter who waited on us this last time we were there and he's magnificent. The food is very good, and the atmosphere is authentic Indian. We will definitely be back, and we would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good Indian food."}
{"text":"We thought we'd try this place so I purchased a Groupon, $16 for $30 worth of food. Thank God for Groupon...
Everything is an added extra charge.
When you order your main dish... Between $14.95 and $25.95 average...
it doesn't include the rice, an extra $12.95, bread was an extra $2.95 and even extra sauce was $2.95. By the time they charged us for every single thing the bill came to over $56.00 for dinner.
I would have given them (NO) Star, but I will say the food was very good. 
I didn't mention that ten minutes into our meal an (unknown) live bug came crawling across our table and then began to circle around our plates and dishware... 
Wow, I seriously lost my appetite at that point. The waiters all rushed over to see what the commotion was about and offered to move us to another table. Not one of them even offered us a discount or anything... 
The only thing that was said by one of the waiter's was... \"We haven't seen one of those type of bugs here since our bug problem back in October,  I guess we need to spray again\". I could not believe it, normally a Manager would have come over and a least apologized and offered to comp our meal or offer a discount or even dessert. NOT a common practice here at India Palace, where the Bug's are KING!
I will definitely NOT be back to experience your over priced food 
(Ala Carte') ways of doing business.
Nobody wants to eat in a bug infested environment... Period!"}
{"text":"This is in my humble opinion the best Indian food in Las Vegas. We had the Chicken Korma, Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, and the Mango lassi. The flavors and spice were superb. Everything was really well balanced and impressive, even the mango lassi which can be hit or miss at some places and overly sweet was really satisfying here. The only sad part was that you have to order rice separately and the portion is a bit skimpy. Who wants to waste all that extra delicious sauce? That sauce is liquid goooold. The food was delicious and warmed up the belly. I immediately needed a nap afterwards."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a very reasonable price. I find the atmosphere nice and the service has always been good. If you are a tourist I'd say its worth venturing off the strip. If you're a local its assumed you know of this place and its quality."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever I have ever had, food was OK but service was awful. We dint even get spoon for buffet. They gave us plastic spoons."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Indian while visiting Las Vegas and I liked that they offer a free mango lasi for checking in on Yelp.

The first time I visit an Indian restaurant I stick with certain dishes. I ordered the malai kofta, chicken tikka masala, samosas, and garlic naan bread. The naan bread was the best part of the meal. It was well made and came out piping out. The samosas were so oily that I barely touched then. The malai kofta had a nice flavor, but I did not enjoy the chicken tikka masala at all. It tasted a little like feet. 

My meal wasn't terrible but I didn't like that they charged for both the rice and the naan bread. One is usually complimentary when you order an entree. I probably would not return because there are plenty of Indian restaurants to try in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"You won't find a better Indian Food restaurant west of the Mississippi!!  Ask for Manny when you stop in!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food in Las Vegas!! Their Naan is to die for and the chicken tiki masala is mouth watering!! Their lunch buffet is damn good too!! If you like Indian food....you have to try this place!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but service is not good at all. I went for lunch and didn't order the buffett - the staff acted all put out by that, and when I tried to order a dessert off the menu they said they'd check and see if they had it. It was OK but nothing special."}
{"text":"Interior is very nice and the smell is wonderful. If you order off the menu everything is al a cart. So I order Chicken Tikka Masla but it doesn't come with rice or naan and the water is room temp tap water! 

The people are very nice.

Food was very good. Got mine spicy and it didn't disappoint

Overall next time we are in Vegas we would go again if we wanted Indian food!"}
{"text":"The service is pathetic. I ordered 2 dosa at noon. We had to wait for 20 minutes and then waiter comes and says the chief forgot the order.
If you have the whole time in the day then come here."}
{"text":"Nice! An excellent Indian food restaurant in my hood.

The food is delish, the staff is super friendly and the decor is appropriate.

We enjoyed the garlic naan, a peas & cottage cheese dish and a cauliflower & potato dish. All were super tasty. Lots of vegetarian options.

I'm really glad we popped in to try this place out. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon to try this place out and ate there earlier this week. My sister in law was in town visiting and is a vegetarian. She was so happy with the selection! I tried at least one bite of every dish (we ordered a lot of food) and every single thing we ordered was delicious! The food was amazing and the service was good too. I suggest you go!"}
{"text":"It took 1 hour to get the order. You have to have some connections with server to get it quick. Server told us that he doesn't have Madara papad however he gave it to group of ppl came after us."}
{"text":"While strolling down Queen Street, I came across India Palace. It is located next door to another Indian restaurant named Little India. This definitely makes for some competition, as each locale had someone standing outside trying to convince people to come in for lunch.

The $10.99 buffet is just awesome. So many tasty Indian treats to choose from and each looks better than the next. Of course I tried a little of each and sat down with a plate overflowing with curries, chicken pieces and rice.

After inhaling all of this goodness, I went back for more (no wonder why I can not lose this belly...no self control!!!). I brought along my younger brother, who was an Indian food virgin, and he absolutely is addicted to Indian cuisine since our visit to this cute little eatery.

When in TO, definitely stop here for an affordable and delicious lunch."}
{"text":"The decor is contemporary and comfortable.  A bit more ventilation and more lighting would be good.  It's hard to read the menu in the dark!  Warning: You really do come out of there smelling heavily scented with the spices... but not in a good way.... unless you like wearing Eau De La India afterwards.

So, onto the food:
Veggie Samosas:  The skin was a bit thick.  Not puffy & airy like I'm used to.

Sambar Vada:  The fried lentil donut had a very thick texture.  I've never this before, but I would've enjoyed it more if it tasted less dense.  The sambar had a nice flavor.  I don't think I could've eaten the donut without it.

Mom ordered the Tandoori Chicken dinner:
The chicken is less smoky and had less tandoori seasoning than other places.  (Those of you used to smoky & lots of seasoning will be disappointed.)  The white meat was cooked perfectly, but the dark meat was a bit underdone near the bones.
The dinner came with saag paneer (good), mixed veggies (spices didn't agree with me... something with a ginseng taste in it & I don't think they pulled the sinewy parts off the snap peas), and soup (flavorless).  The mango custard never came & we didn't bother to ask because we were too full.

I ordered the Chicken Sagwala.  Well, for $14.95, you would expect to get more than just a few chunks of chicken.   The bowl was just slightly a bit larger than the side dish of saag paneer my Mom received with her dinner.   

Garlic Naan:  good

Overall, it was ok.  I would go back again to try the buffet just to see if they had a dish that could out do the dinner I had."}
{"text":"Visited twice to the India Palace restaurant on my trip to Las vegas. The ambience is good. As soon as you enter, you could see the photos of various bollywood stars which sets very high expectations but the taste and quality does not live up to the standards. Both the times of my visit, we had buffet for lunch. The idly is supposed to be soft and fresh but it's the exact opposite. The sambar tastes sweet. For the desert, they served mango custard with cut fruits inside which is purely an essence and not freshly prepared. The north Indian sabji were not great. The rice, dhaal and raita was good and tasty. Overall the restaurant is not as advertised and does not live up to the high yelp review ratings."}
{"text":"Good Indian food. Have been going to this place for a long time. Sometimes they are out of South Indian dishes but if you ask them they might prepare it for you. I like their buffet as well. chicken tikka masala is to die for"}
{"text":"I had dinner with my family. I really liked the soup. The service was exceptional. It was slightly pricey with about $25 per person, but overall we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Wasn't great by any means. Three stars at most. Tandoori chicken tasted like it was from a day before. Burnt smell. Was a little disappointed. Not too many choices for buffet compared to other competitors."}
{"text":"This is my first foray into Indian cooking here in Las Vegas. So I have to say Im very impressed with the scope of the menu as with the freshness and flavors of the dishes.

Service was alright, not particularly friendly but efficient none the less though there was an older woman bringing out the dishes, she was amazing! I think she may have been one of the owners. Just amazingly warm and friendly, wish she was our server the whole time.

The tvs and sound system were playing Bollywood music videos which was pretty fun! They do have a full bar! Oh and be sure to check in, we got a free mango lassi. 

On to the dishes..

Chicken Tikka - Moist, fragrant, flavorful and oh so tender!

Chicken Tikka Masala - Big bold flavors, creamy and again insanely tender.

Malai Kofta - Similar to the Chicken Masala though not as spicy. Balls of cheese and vegetable sitting in a thick creamy gravy. 

Garlic Naan - Lightly crisp with a nice chew this complimented our dishes with the ability to scoop up the amazing sauces. 

Basmati Rice - Another amazing vehicle for the more gravy laden dishes. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is small and somewhat hidden. Their food is pretty good. I'd tried almost all of them and they all taste good. I would come back to this place. They had mango custard and rice pudding dessert."}
{"text":"Wife and I tried the lunch buffet at India Palace and found it to be OK, but unremarkable and a little under-spiced.

The restaurant is rather pleasant compared to some of the strip mall establishments that Vegas Indian places can be, but I just didn't have my socks blown off enough for a repeat visit or to want to sample the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Came here during Tiff festival, and early not. That busy. 
Placed my order, and they brought the incorrect dish.
Due to time constraints I ate it anyway ,
And frankly the food is sub par. 

The house white whine was lame. 

After dinner, they whisked the plates away and brought the bill right away. 

They did not bring the included dessert either

At this point, I was just happy to pay and leave. 

Time to rebuild this palace folks!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! My husband and I love Indian food and by far this is the best we've had. Very fairly priced menu with something for everyone, service was very good and we will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Order the peas pillouf rice instead of regular basmati. You won't regret it! Great service. Seems like a popular spot and filled up quick as we were enjoying our meal. Loved the veggie korma!"}
{"text":"We have been out of state for 5 years and we're so excited about coming back to our favorite Indian Food Restaurant, India Palace!!  We were pleasantly surprised to see the Owner again and the food is even better than we remembered!!  Just the right spice level and true authentic delicious Indian Food!!  If you haven't tried this delicious restaurant, do yourself a favor and come in to try this amazing and authentic Indian Cuisine?  I promise you'll be glad you did"}
{"text":"Love this place! This is a must for us everytime we come to Vegas! The food is fresh, authentic and so goodddd. Our favorite server is Eldon! He not only remembers our EXACT order everytime, but brings out our food quick even when its busy, makes us feel like VIP's can't wait to come back everytime we are in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre: chicken tandoori undercooked and the sauce was bland. The lamb curry was okay, although the lamb meat seems to have been reheated once or twice because it was not at all tender. I called to order take-out and they apparently \"don't deliver\" and pointed us to food delivery services, including Uber eats. I found out the hard way that, unlike every other Indian restaurant at which I have eaten, dishes don't come with rice - one needs to order separately. I must have missed that fine print on my phone and upon calling the restaurant to inquire they said I'd have to take it up with uber eats. So $43 for glorified and mediocre chicken wings and basically a reheated lamb curry stew and these guys are happy to point fingers at the delivery service they have chosen to use. I suspect, given the restaurant's proximity to the strip, most of it's customers are tourists and the trouble with tourist joints is they don't have to live on repeat business so can afford to serve mediocre food and tell you \"too bad\" when you complain about it. I certainly wouldn't patronize this swill stand again."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Las Vegas in my opinion. However I have only eaten at 4 total. If there is a better one please let me know, but this India Palace is legit! 

I really love everything on the menu but my favorites are  the chicken vindaloo, tiki masala, lamb samosa, raita, garlic naan bread, tandoori chicken.. Mango Lassi is a must also!

You aren't going to get the most incredible service here but the place is clean and has a very nice classy atmosphere.  It's all about the food here."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and courteous waitstaff. The combination dinners are a tremendous value, more food than one can eat, and they even let me substitute one of the dishes. I will be back again."}
{"text":"It's ok...nothing to rave about or put down. We ordered for 7 people. Food was ok..Binda masala was good and the rest was ok at best."}
{"text":"Come here for good, authentic Indian curry! I've only ever gotten their curries and tandoori chicken and they are simply one of the best in town. Even though there are a few on the west side of town, I always willingly and happily drive from summerlin all the way across town to eat at Cafe India. 

Their curries are flavorful, well-balanced and have morsels of tender meat - everything I look for in a curry. There have been a few times they didn't quite get the spice level right but they are more than willing to bring you additional hot peppers or even take it back to the kitchen. The tandoori chicken is simply heavenly, very juicy and soft. Just beware that if you do have it during their fabulous lunch buffet hours that it might be a tad drier than if you order it as an dinner entree.

And have I mentioned how great their lunch buffet is? $10 (I believe) and you get mango custard, lamb vindaloo (sometimes) and that spinach one that I really like.... and chicken marsala, tandoori chicken, naan, rice etc. Basically there's going to be more than what you can eat!

Their only downfall is their inconsistent service. Now it's not bad, but sometimes they can come off as brisk or they get very busy and it takes a while to be noticed. However, whenever that happens, their manager always noticed and would make amends, which makes it alright in my eyes. Besides, it's an indian restaurant and I'm sitting back, relaxing and not expecting things to be done as quickly as an American restaurant. When in Rome, do as Romans do!"}
{"text":"First time trying the restaurant out. The food was luke warm not hot and fresh. I could see 8 ice chest in the kitchen area and I could see some food in one like they put the Curry in side the ice chest. I'm not sure how it works but no one was cooking in that kitchen. While sitting at our table the lady came and ask to clean our table off, we had to take our stuff off the table including the check to pay to, let her clean the table, she then came and was sweeping under the table so I was moving my feet around. Not welcoming, not friendly and food was not good maybe it's good when it's hot."}
{"text":"India Palace is a delicious place to eat. I got the chicken tikka masala and it was amazing! It doesn't taste processed or like a microwaved frozen meal. It taste homemade and with a great blend if spices! They have great vegan options as well!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Learned about it after eating their food at an Indian wedding.  I haven't gone anywhere else for Indian food, since.  I like their chicken tikka masala, palak paneer and vegetable korma. Haven't had a bad meal yet.  Keep up the good work Indian Palace!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and authentic. Always consistant. If you don't like your food too spicy I would recommend less than a 3 on the scale of 1-10. I asked for a 3 and the food was HOT. They have a loyal following in Las Vegas. I believe it's one of the best places for Indian in Las Vegas. My other favorite in Las Vegas is Ghadhi. 

PROS: 
Chicken Korma - mildly spiced chicken in a cream sauce with cashews, almonds & raisins
Baingan Bharta - tandoor baked eggplant sautéed with herbs & spices
Rack of Lamb - baby lamb chops marinated in yogurt & spices cooked in tandoor

CONS: Portions are small."}
{"text":"India Palace has been my go-to Indian food spot for a while now. I stick to lunch buffets as I don't really mess with dinner at most Indian restaurants; its usually just the same served a la carte at higher prices. 

Palace along with majority of the all the Indian restaurants in town is located in a somewhat shady area just north of UNLV. While the area might suck, IP is probably the nicest building in the area which helps a bit. 

Going into a Indian lunch buffet I know exactly what I want to eat: chicken tikka (the boneless chicken chunks in the creamy orange sauce), saag (spinch dip with extra butter), samosas, rice and naan. Based of this, India Palace delivers a great lunch buffet. The food is refreshed regularly (frequency depends on how busy it is) and the quality has been consistent. My one gripe is that they never give you enough naan and make you wait when you request more.

The restaurant as I mentioned is pretty nice, recently renovated and is great for large groups or more intimate meetings but the parking is terrible. Service is average, they've messed up my check several times and I have had to call them out on it every time. 

Remember the yelp check in for a free mango lassie (only 1 per table wtf?) and the yelp deal!"}
{"text":"The only place we go for indian besides my kitchen!  They have some awesome indian beers too.  Try the mango dessert.  Be warned, the vindaloo wasn't spicy at all.  The tandoori & tikka masala rock!
I love it, I love it, I love it!"}
{"text":"If I could give India Palace 100 stars I would. From customer service to quality of food to quantity of food I give them the HIGHEST rating and praise. But that's nothing. Here's the real review. I ordered a delivery order on possibly the worst day of the year; Rock and Roll Marathon. East to West travel was completely halted across Las Vegas Boulevard South; The Strip. Not knowing this at the time of my order, we ordered. A little while later, Roy, the manager called me to tell me that the roads were closed. But instead of giving up, Roy personally went miles out of the way to bring us our order. He didn't have to and frankly most managers would have just cancelled the order and moved on. Not Roy. He went WAY above and beyond the call of duty to fulfill the order. And don't ask me how he did it, but the order arrived piping hot and DELICIOUS. Oh, and let's not forget the icing on the cake, because the order took longer than expected, he refunded me 30% of my order. This is what I call customer service and also what I call my ONLY go to Indian restaurant. I HIGHLY recommend India Palace. Say hi to Roy for me."}
{"text":"The way I found the India Palace was to ask the locals where they go. Over and over the recommendation was the India Palace. This place is consistently good. Never fails to please and I've been going here for  years. Make a point of at least one meal here on every Vegas visit. Can't go wrong here. Great service, great food, great price."}
{"text":"India Palace is an excellent alternative to nearby buffets on the Strip... and (generally speaking) far less expensive!  For about $12, you get a solid variety of popular Indian dishes (Chicken Tikka, Tandoori, Veggie Korma, Dosas, Basmati, Naan, Salad, and Desserts... to name a few), which all taste pretty good.  I have had Indian food all over the world, so that's a definite compliment from me.

Although the place was pretty clean and had decent decor, the service leaves some room for improvement.  The location is also a bit seedy, but understandable as it is on the outskirts of the Strip.  I also gagged when I discovered something that resembled a cockroach leg in my Masala.  After inspection, I'd like to give India Palace the benefit of the doubt even though I've never seen such a thing in the countless Masala dishes I've had; but nevertheless, it totally ruined my appetite... but not enough to not give India Palace a second chance.  

The lack of service and room for improvement on the curries (I have had better- Saagar in Newport Beach is a comparable place and is much better) led me to give 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"The buffet has all the staples of Indian food. My fav lamb and chicken tiki. They also have garlic nan. Food was freshly prepared and tasty. Was not overly spicy. Restaurant it self was clean and decorated nicely. Will definitely come again. The owner stated they have a better buffet on weekends for same price."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time tonight. Food was amazing as usual. Service was amazing as well by the great Gary. He's our usual server and he always has a smile on his face and is very kind. Always checking to see how our food was going. We are very loyal to this Indian restaurant do to the amazing food and because of Gary. We have become regulars here and it is well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Food was good but the attitude of the restaurant was bad. We ordered dosas ad then asked for extra sambar. The new sambar was totally different from the earlier one and was very watery. On top of it, they did not tell us that this would be charged extra. In the final bill they charged 4$ for each cup of sambar. This is ridiculous. You should inform the customer when you serve them and not try to make money this way! When we complained regarding the quality and not being told, they took it off the bill. To the restaurant staff- do not do this again. Please inform the customer when you serve."}
{"text":"Wow, really great meal from the buffet that I had here. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing food. The Tika masalla and Naan was so good! The waiter was really nice. I had a long conversation  about India and the different cities in India. If this place was in Summerland it would be jam packed!"}
{"text":"I have had Indian food before and this place is about average with the rest. The place was kind of dirty and dark. The food was average at best and prob would go somewhere else first next time."}
{"text":"Loved this place ... We went to this place on a Saturday night before a show and can't enough good things about this place.

Pros:  awesome service - very funny and down to earth, fantastic food, clean restrooms, fast service, and again ... The food was terrific.  Loved the big screen tv and the Indian music videos - nice touch.

Cons:  lady welcoming us at the front door could have smiled once or twice, but no big deal.

Would definitely rinse and repeat !"}
{"text":"Food is good. Dosai is delicious. Lamb briyani is salty and chicken tikka masala is yummy. 

Services....
One guy is super nice and another guy is rude. 

They have lunch buffet but I prefer to order the food that can satisfied my craving."}
{"text":"Went in to this place because of the yelp deal. Really not a deal, since food is over priced. Okay indian food, not great! Decent enough to get rid of that curry craving. Have not tried buffet, but will report back on that soon"}
{"text":"I took my cousin to try this place as she had never had indian before and was interested in trying it. She loved it! We ordered the chicken tikka and a lamb vindaloo. Both were excellent, but the chicken tikka was amazing. I was pleasantly surprised to see my old friend Vimil (Vick) working here now. He took great care of us. I love the location of this place, right next door to my favorite gay bar. I need to go back to try the lunch buffet. 

If you love indian food or have never tried it, I highly recommend this place. Ask for Vick and he will help you figure out what to order."}
{"text":"Finally after several years of going to lunch at another nearby Indian restaurant we tried India Palace. What took us so long??? Yeah, the neighborhood. I would be pleased if they hired some armed soldiers with .303 Enfield rifles to stand at the doorway and of course in traditional Indian Army garb! Just kidding, but that is a part of Las Vegas that isn't a place to walk through at any time of day.
What really surprised us was the immediate sense of peace and luxury when you stepped inside. What the hec?! are we in the Bellagio off east Twain?! Felt like stepping into a 1970 Ford Pinto and on the inside it's a 2010 Ferrari! Although we've been dining on Indian fare for many years, we still don't know the proper names of all the different foods, yeah Sag is Spinach, Naan is the bread and so on... but what we do know is that the food here at the lunch buffet at India Palace is probably the best we've ever tried in So. Nevada. The flavors were all a step above the competition, service was attentive and friendly. The buffet line is a bit shorter in length than the competition, but the overall quality far exceeds quanity. Naan bread is brought to your table fresh and not in cold piles in the buffet line. Overall a great experience and we have been converted. I'll even overlook the overly engergetic Bollywood videos they play behind the bar. Oh yes, I like Samosas, but no one seems to have it available very often, I do miss those."}
{"text":"Ryan C and I enjoyed a nice meal here today. It was only the second time ever having Indian food. I thought the place was very clean, the staff helpful and the boofay, good. 

I could eat rice, chicken and bread all day but the rest of it was good too. 

Do not eat the trailmix/spice looking stuff if you hate black licorice."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the onion kulcha and karahi chicken. Tarka daal and aaloo gobhi was awesome in vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I think this is a very good example of when you go wrong in selecting the places to go for based on reviews. The place is nice and fine. I went for the bufet with my friends and the dishes were very limited (no breakfast items, no biryanis) and mostly below average in taste. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who seeks to have a good authentic and tasteful indian food (south Indian people esp). I hope this helps others who are searching for places to go based on the taste afterall thats what we need to feel satisfied after a good meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Had lamb vindaloo and chicken tikki Marsala and both was very tasty dishes. Enjoyed a nice cold Taj Mahal beer with my meal and a mango kulfi for desert. All the food was delicious and the waiters and waitresses were friendly. Been coming here for a while and not planning on going anywhere else"}
{"text":"great food. great service.cant be beat. tried other places around town and only one other comes close. always end up back here. good selection. i usually go in for lunch. family came into town and had to take them here."}
{"text":"Firstly, I'm not Indian nor do I consider myself an expert on Indian cuisine. However, at this point I have tried enough places to know how I like it as far as the staples. I really wanted some Indian food before I left Vegas. Decided based on the reviews and menu that this would be the place I'd give a go. Came here around the time they open and had the lunch buffet.

Pros
Paneer Chilli was delicious. I've had paneer before but never spicy like this. I'm not a huge spicy food fan but this was the best thing I tasted here.

Garlic naan brought to the table was good. Some places make garlic naan with really big chunks of garlic which means you're biting directly into the garlic when you chew it. This was baked into the naan and the perfect size. Sprinkled with a little bit of cilantro, which I love. 

Food was fresh and well seasoned

Gulab Jamun was really good.

Cons

While the goat was well seasoned, it tasted a bit too chewy. 

I came here, rather than other places, because I saw Gulab Jamun and Gajjar Halwa on the menu. Neither were part of the desert portion of the buffet unfortunately. I ended up getting both to go. I just started eating gajar halwa. This was ok but the one I had in MD was better. It wasn't as smooth and creamy. 

Tandoori chicken was seasoned well but a tad dry. Still decent but dry.

Neighborhood is a bit sketchy. Didn't bother me much but I'd be careful.


Overall, I liked it. Wouldnt go out of my way to get it but if I was in the area I'd definitely go back"}
{"text":"This is a very good Indian restaurant. Everything we ordered was very good. Garlic Naan and Onion Kulcha were very good. We got there at 5 mins to closing and they were very gracious to let us in anyway. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was craving Indian food on our trip so I found this on Yelp of course. The food was excellent! Vick was awesome and if I get back to Vegas, I will visit again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Hole in the wall location but after reading reviews, we came for dinner. Chicken Tikka Marsala delicious.  Lamb Korma awesome. Our picky 8 year loved the Lamb and he is like Mikey! Naan bread soft and warm. Will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"The place is clean, the staff if very attentive and the food is tasty. They'll spice it up or down to suit your desire. I'll stop there whenever I'm on the west side."}
{"text":"Solid Indian fare.  Good prices and very tasty.  Not too oily.  Staff was very friendly.  Service was a bit slower than expected based on crowd, but the food was worth waiting.  We'll be heading back to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Really good lunch buffet! They had all my favorites, and were careful about keeping the vegetarian stuff and meat stuff separate. The ambiance here is very nice. The only reason I am giving four and not five stars is the location. It seemed very scary, even in the middle of the afternoon. I would not come here at night, especially not by myself. It's a shame such a nice place is in such a shady neighborhood. 

I've tried a few Indian places during various trips to Vegas, and I must say this was the best food for sure. The people working here are also very nice. Overall this was a good experience and I suggest trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Vick was personable, attentive and had many great recommendations and made dining here very pleasurable. The food was staggered and kept coming. Start to finish everything was delicious. I get into town 3-4 times per year and definitely will be back next time. Don't miss this little hidden gem off the Strip!"}
{"text":"It's a rather sad thing that I don't frequent Indian restaurants. Being ethnically Indian, I should be galloping to the nearest Indian place to gorge on the curries and breads but I never do. The first reason is that for the most part, the Indian buffets or restaurants leave me with a very uneasy stomach. The second reason is that a lot of Indian restaurants leave something to be desired in the hygiene department. 

I'm happy to say that India Palace has somewhat alleviated my prejudices against Indian restaurants (esp the ones in Las Vegas). We went on a Sunday afternoon. They serve a lunch buffet (12/13 bucks) every day. The restaurant was packed! And it was quite well decorated...muted romantic colors, nice lighting...wow..a refreshing change from the usual Indian buffet experience. 

One of my friends' went for the buffet which had about 10 dishes and a multitude of salads, yogurt dipping sauces and deserts. My husband has partaken in the buffet before and both of them had only good things to say about the buffet. 

As I was feeling not too hungry, I decided to have something from their dosa menu. I ordered an onion and chili oothapam (thick pancake made from fermented idli/dosa batter. The batter needs to have a distinct sour taste and it is topped generously with onion/veggies or whatever you fancy). This was served with a Sambar and coconut chutney. The oothapam itself was pretty good and the Sambar although definitely not authentic traditional South Indian sambar, certainly tasted good. My friend had a paper dosa which was crisp and tasty and my husband had the mysore masala dosa (dosa stuffed with a spicy potato masala with some spicy chutney in it). 

I was pretty stoked to eat South Indian dosas in Vegas and have it taste good and be seated in a relatively nice establishment. 

The service was a bit crazy..they had about 5 waiters/waitresses and no one was wearing any sort of uniform. All the wait staff were Indian and so were the customers...imagine my confusion and uncertainty when calling for service. 

My husband also had the chai and said it was really good. He didn't leave any for me to try so I'd have to take his word for it. I ordered coffee...although not the traditional filter coffee served in South India, the combination of the coffee and dosa made for a very satisfying lunch. 

I'd definitely go back for their dosa offerings."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas.  The people here are all really nice and helpful.  The food is delicious and very consistently so.  I love that when I order spicy, they actually make it spicy.  Some ethnic restaurants assume Americans can't tolerate a little heat.  The location is a little dodgy but the interior is actually quite nice and inviting.

Be on the lookout for coupons and specials-- they participate in a lot of the usual deal sites."}
{"text":"Great service, clean, and awesome dishes! Make sure to ask for Manny as your server, very nice and funny! 

Have a Haywards 5000 and the goat curry!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the Paneer Sabji. The service was also great. Will come visit again."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy!!

How I have missed Indian food since moving to Texas :(
So while in Toronto, we stopped by the India Palace on recommendation...and a great recommendation it was!

We went for dinner, my bf had a ginger pepper dish and boy was it HOT!!! sheesh, Lol!
I went for the dinner special-GREAT CHOICE! hehehehe! A samosa, butter chicken, naan, a cauliflower side dish and a nice little dessert to finish it off....all for less than $15!!! AT dinner!!!

We left full, didn't overspend and had great service from our waiter even though almost all the tables were filled!! Wow!!

Thanks for satisfying my craving, India Palace!"}
{"text":"Vick provides Awesome service , very polite and very hard working and smiling person who makes you feel at home with his best service to cater to customers.

Food is the best Indian food in vega

Please do visit the place and I highly recommended this place to people who love Indian food and good service"}
{"text":"I wasn't super impressed with the India Palace buffet. They had a few interesting selections that I don't usually see at Indian buffets (like malai kofta- yum!), and also a few things that just looked downright unappetizing (the haleem looked really, really unappetizing- and my husband confirmed my suspicions when he, braver than I, gave it a try- it was gross). The chutneys were weird and it was hard to track down a server when we needed a drink refill or something. The malai kofta was tasty, though, as well as a chicken dish I sampled and I liked the inclusion of samosas on the buffet... but the gulab jamun tasted like soap and chemicals and overall I just got a weird vibe. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The Lamb Korma is one of the best things I've ever eaten and service is impeccable, even when using discount. Definitely reasonable pricing and portions, don't let the neighborhood scare you this is a superior Indian place to many in fancier locations!  I've come here for ladies lunch and family dinner same happy tummy:)"}
{"text":"Another bad visit. We used to go here a lot, years ago. But after renovation, it seemed like they became desperate for money. Prices went up, I guess to pay for all the upgrades. Things went downhill. Last visit, about two years ago, we were disgusted when the waiter tried to scam us on the bill. Believe me: it was not a misunderstanding. It was a trick. Every Indian restaurant serves rice with the (already overpriced) entrees. Not here. Waiter asked if we wanted rice; we said of course. But when we got the bill, they charged us for an expensive rice dish, not regular rice. So we did not go back all this time. Went back again now, same thing. Tried to charge us for papadum refill, which every other Indian restaurant serves complimentary, like bread. Then, asked us if we wanted peas in our rice, which was a sneaky way of trying to upsell us once again. Then, when I confronted the server, he didn't try to listen to me at all. He argued and defended their policy, and said that's just the way it is. Then he told me he is the manager! When I told him every other place will include rice, refill papadum, etc, he said they were number one in Las Vegas, and he did not care what other places were doing. Personally, I don't care if an entree costs $10, $20, whatever. If I order it, then I pay for it, and it was my choice. But I hate to be nickeled and dimed. And obviously, I don't want to be scammed. So, I would never go back. I will inform everyone I know what happened (I am a local). I will blog and Yelp and let the public know what they are doing (BE WARNED), and how management is treating customers. Mint and Mt. Everest are FAR better choices for Indian food in Las Vegas. Goodbye, India Palace. Never, ever again."}
{"text":"Never again. My husband brought me food home the first time. He told me they got food off the buffet but I didn't realize the buffet was closed! It had just been sitting there. Well, this time, they did the same thing. Hubby's plate was dirty and he told them ( the place had 2 other tables on a Friday night) and the lady took it and walked over to paces and washed it with a dirty rag she was cleaning with and then gave it back to him! We bought samosas ( served over a tiny big of ragged brown white lettuce) and three other meals plus rice. After the Appetizer, when we asked for a new plate, the English lady said \"we don't normally do this but okay\" . THANKS! And they don't give free refills on any drinks, even coke and iced tea! I spent almost 60 bucks there, paying extra for rice and nan bread. The food was good but I hope u go under just like the place I heard the English lady ran before. You deserve to go under. U don't know how to treat your customers. I wish I wouldn't have given you a tip. Shame on you. 60 dollars for that service. Goodbye."}
{"text":"My husband and I simply love this place. We have been patrons here for over 10 years and although the food is pricey since everything is a la carte, it is well worth every penny. The restaurant also offers a lunch buffet which we have taken advantage of once or twice, however, we mainly love their dinners. The wait staff is extremely friendly and attentive. I highly recommend their chicken tikka masala, the curry sauce is to die for. I also love the chicken korma, again fantastic flavor. You can order the dishes mild, medium or spicy. They have recently really ramped up the spicy, so it is very spicy indeed. Can't wait to eat here again soon."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We ordered a delivery. They said 45 minutes but after an hour and a half it still wasn't here. We tried calling but they didn't answer. When we finally got hold of them they said that they are too busy and hung up the phone. We called again. After several attempts they picked up the phone and said that we must wait another 25 minutes  that was after already 1.5 hours waiting. 
We got the food after 1:45 hours. The paper dosa was dry and not crispy at all. Obviously it wasn't fresh. 
They forgot to deliver rice"}
{"text":"Food is not good and service is bad. On top of it they charged 18% gratuity without telling us. We were four adults and two kids."}
{"text":"Nice place. A bit noisy. But the second time we went the service was better and food much better."}
{"text":"This review is for their lunch buffet.

I was so lucky today.  The buffet had my favorite entree and dessert, all for about $10, which normally would have cost me close to $20 easily.  

-Goat Karahi:  The meat was so tender and flavorful. Place a piece of this delicate meat on a piece of naan, add some white onions and a squeeze of lemon...what do you get?  Yummy yummy in my tummy!

-Kheer: Traditional rice pudding made with basmati rice, milk, sugar & saffron.  I can eat 2 bowls of this easily.  So DeliCious.

They constantly bring out naan to you when your basket gets low.

Aside from these 2 awesome things that I eat from the buffet line, they also offer other dishes like the pakora, aloo gobi, chicken tandoori, and many other dishes and desserts (my friend had mango custard and she said it was very good...I vowed to try it next time by not overstuffing myself with the kheer).  Their menu changes though.  The other time that I was here, instead of the goat karahi, they had lamb vindaloo.  Instead of kheer, they had gulab jamun (milk cheese balls soaked in a honey syrup), which was a sad day for me :(.  I expressed to the server with a pout, indicating that I would much prefer the kheer.  Next thing you know, he brought out a serving of kheer just for me!  Yay to the awesome server!

Therefore, if there are certain items that you like, you might want to call ahead to check out what's on their line.  Other than that, if you feel adventurous, please check this place out. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price and great service. I would definitely recommend this place! We tried bunch of curries and bread basket along with few appetizers. We liked everything we ordered!"}
{"text":"First time at India Palace. I stumbled across this treasure when I was in search of satisfying my craving for mouth watering Goat curry.

I got off work on a Tuesday and Goat Curry was calling my name. I read the Yelp reviews on here and decided this is totally happening. 

Located on Paradise and Twain.

Ordered Take Out of Appetizer Combo which includes ( Scrumptious samosas, Fish, Pakora and Paneer). Fish was fishy. I asked for Goat Curry and ended up with Karahi Goat which was full of flavor and huge portion. I ordered it medium spicy because I appreciate the heat.

It doesn't come with rice or naan so I ordered Garlic Naan . Pickup was extra quick and the food was hot and full of flavor. 

The service is on par.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Only complaint was a lot of fat on the chicken pieces in the Chicken Korma. The flavor and spice level was good though. Service was good. Wine selection was horrible (stick with the Indian beer). Apps were tasty and after dinner they served everyone a complimentary galub  jamun. Yum!"}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet is typical of most others.  Every time I've been, it's been good...  

Pretty typical buffet selection...

I like it, but it's not that special... Not sure what else to say..."}
{"text":"It was beautifully decorated, but I really wish the food had been a lot hotter. My friend and I were starving, but l have issues with food being tepid. I'm surprised that the Indians we saw there would actually stand for it - the Indians back in India had no problems with returning food if it wasn't piping hot...which is how I like my food.

The naan wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've had, either.

Today's features offered some lovely eggplant (*purrs with happiness*) and good vegetarian dishes as well. I had their chicken curry, but it was the veggie dishes that did it for me.

I'd like to take hubby to this place to gauge his reaction.

Bonus? The food wasn't salty and I didn't guzzle 2 gallons of water an hour after having eaten there.

For now, 3 stars."}
{"text":"The only thing worse than food here is the music. The naan is in the size of three pancakes stuffed together. Most of the food seemed frozen and then heated and served. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've never been a big fan of Indian cuisine, but my meal here was excellent. I had the Lamb Rogan Josh with the peas pulao rice and a side of garlic naan. Everything was fresh and delicious. The lamb rogan josh in particular was very well balanced with the seasoning and the lamb was tender.

One word of caution, the surrounding neighborhood is a little sketchy so be careful walking there at night."}
{"text":"Went for the $10.99 lunch buffet today. Lots of choices -- 4 veggie dishes and 6 meat dishes (shrimp, chicken, beef and lamb).

Compared to Little India right next door (literally), Palace uses more spice, so the dishes have more zing and hotness. And I loved every bite.

Very nice ambiance and all the food seemed to be high quality, so I would definitely recommend India Palace."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the wonderful people who work and run this place! Super nice, friendly and helpful. 
The food was very, very good. Ordered tandoori mixed grill, chicken tikka masala, basmati rice & garlic naan = aprox $55. More than enough for both of us to be stuffed. 
Sketchy area so be careful if you're not familiar with areas."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. It feel like in India and the best part is that you can order the meal mild, spicy or super spicy and they will do it for you. Totally worthy and succulent"}
{"text":"The  place  is  really  cool  . Food   is  awesome  . Serving s  quick  .  we  ordered  two  chicken  dishes  which  was  just   superb  . Gary  served   us  with   smiling  face  n   he  s   very courteous  with  plesant   persona  .He   certainly know s  the way  to  serve the  customer  in  a friendly  way  .Chicken  kadai  was  very delicious  . hotel ambiance  too s  quite  nice   but  just  wish the  location  wud  be on the  strip. we  would  again  visit the place  for sure  ."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Every year I come to Sedona, and every year I eat multiple meals here because it's delicious and healthy and sooo much better than most Sedona restaurants (most of which which are made for people without any standards apparently).   Next to Elote, I think this is one of the best restaurants in the Sedona area.  You can always get in and it's delicious and healthy, and they don't over-use oil or salt.  Tonight I had the veg combination plate, which has saag paneer, dal, veg kofta, rice and naan (garlic or plain), all for $14.95.  For a decadent and tasty dessert try the gulab jamun - delicious little round donut-like balls soaked in honey/rosewater - just wonderful. Plus they have a short but decent selection of wines (in addition to a full bar).  They also have a little patio - too cold tonight but I've used in the past.  Last visit, I ate here 3 nights out of 5.  I don't know why this place isn't rated higher other than people who don't like Indian food eat here.  In the 20 or so years I've visited regularly I've only found a few good restaurants (I'm from Chicago so standards are high) and this is my second favorite - it's more a labor of love by the owners than a regular restaurant.  The little Thai place nearby is also excellent."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite of my girlfriend and myself. We would happily make the 40 minute drive for the lunch buffet. 

I'm not sure exactly what happened (We think it's a different owner, but that's just speculation) but it's definitely not worth the drive anymore. It isn't bad (although there were certainly a few things I could play food critic with), but there are plenty of Indian places in the Phoenix area where the food is just better."}
{"text":"Food still good, however I feel like it's quality declining gradually... Maybe update and change the buffet menu sometime? Waiters need some (a lot) of training..."}
{"text":"Great place! We were welcomed in right away and seated. Nice atmosphere, great friendly service and amazing food. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This review is way past due. I have been coming here fro at least 5 years. Probably one of my favorite places for lunch. They have a great Lunch buffet. I have gone here with friends and they feel the same. Great Tandoori chicken and chicken Masala. Good service and nice quite atmosphere. I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Indian food in the valley and I think I just stumbled upon a diamond in the rough in India Palace. Very nice clean place tucked away in the corner of a strip mall. The ladies working the floor were traditional but still very nice and accommodating. The food was amazing with the garlic naan being a newfound addiction of mine. Washed down with some classic Indian beer Taj Mahal premium lager and the only thing left was to take a nap. I would recommend this place to anyone who just likes good food with no prejudice to unique and bold flavors. Thank you India Palace for a full gullet and smile of indulgence on my face."}
{"text":"If you like Indian food, you'll love this place. Amazing atmosphere and wonderful food. The Chicken Tiki Masala is to die for!!! 

Along with the Garlic Naan! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food.  India Palace is probably the best Indian food you can get in Vegas.  The service is great.  The food...even better.  There are only TWO suggestions I can make to management.  #1, please change the GOD AWFUL television playing on the wall.  It is like watching a Mexican sitcom.  They all look the same, everything is over acted and nothing is funny.  Well, the same can be said about what is on the TVs at India Palace.  #2, I like wine.  Servers at India Palace will cork the wine behind the bar and bring an uncorked bottle to the table.  This is a BIG NO NO in wine service.  See my review of The Broiler in Hawaii.  Anyway, visit this place.  The TV is terrible, wine is uncorked (wine faux pas) but the service and food are spot on!"}
{"text":"Passed by here a thousand times before I decided to try it out.

In the corner of a pretty average strip mall, the interior of this joint was super decorated. Service was professional.

I had the naan bread, chicken tikka massala, and tandoori chicken. All were great. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Best Indian close to my home and I am in 85016.  Always very friendly and courteous when you arrive.  Food is awesome every time.  Love the Indian Coffee.  I would recommend to anyone who loves the spices of India!  Great for having a meal with a Vegan Friend!  Comfortable surroundings and very clean.  Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian Food in Las Vegas, total flavor, authentic, full bar. Loved it, am going back!!"}
{"text":"Really tasty and authentic flavors . We got the garlic naan and the karahi chicken . Mango lassi was great too !!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian joints in Las Vegas. On this run we got Panner Tikka Masala Garlic Chili Naan Tandoori Chicken. All bomb! Definitely recommend coming here. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our go to Indian yumminess! Gotta have those samosas, saag paneer, korma, tikki masala and garlic naan on the regular. Thank you for being so awesome and delicious!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is the best. You can try a variety of foods and everything is fabulous! My favorite is the chicken Tikka Masada, Naan, and the rice pudding/gulab jaman (that's probably spelled wrong). Best Indian food around!"}
{"text":"Went there for their South Indian food however they were out 
Ordered their Punjabi veg food and it was awesome"}
{"text":"Love love the food, the services super nice and the favors right on.  I suggest you guys try it out."}
{"text":"We had ordered chicken tikka masala, dal makhani and naan there. It was simply YUM!!! Daal was tooo good!!! The lady of the place was really nice to us... Its definitely a to-go place for us on our next trip to Las Vegas..."}
{"text":"Disgusting food. Quality of the food was very low. Pathetic service. Just got out of the restaurant. Food was so bad that im here outside the restaurant in the parking lot writing this review."}
{"text":"Totally awesome family run home cooked delicious-ness. Was my first time. Can get mild medium or spicy version of dishes. Lots of awesome flavor!"}
{"text":"Good indian food but there are better places.  The Naan bread was cold and the entree's were over-priced and small in portions.  Good service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food in Vegas. A much more upscale place than most of the other Indian restaurants (many are mall spots). 

Naan, korma and saag were all excellent and a little on the spicy side. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for Indian food in Vegas and don't mind spending a few dollars more for better ambiance."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and attentive service. The food is good but not excellent. It does hit the spot if your craving Indian. Lots of no meat options, too. The place is in an ugly part of town but the restaurant is super cute inside."}
{"text":"Delicious buffet,  and I have tried several dozens across the country. Decent selection,  good salads and soups.  Free plain or garlic naans made to order, garlic naans were tasty and soft like I like. Spinach were creamy and not watery,  delicious! Meat morcels in dishes were of good quality. Keep it up! !
 This $11.95 lunch buffet totally hit the spot, this may have become my new favorite LV Indian buffet."}
{"text":"This is a review of the midweek buffet, which goes for about $10. Over all I found the buffet to be very good, but many dishes lacked spice. 
The parking lot was near full at 1:00 PM on a Thursday afternoon. There is a school in the same shopping center and the spots are taken up by students. 
There are about 12 different indian dishes. They also offer a salad, which has Jalapeno peppers in it. There were three different kinds of chutney and some other toppings. Naan is brought to the party of four at my table. One was plan naan. The other chiffonade of greens. They did  not impart much taste, but looked nice. The naan is thin but tender. 
There were three different dishes that used Lamb. Two were spicey the other was not. 
Chai tea was available for the taking. You can also have dessert of rice pudding or Image result for indian dessert balls: Gulab Jamun. 
This is almost a five star buffet. Most of the food was bland. Indian food is hot, but I do understand that they must accommodate their customers.
 I highly recommend their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Coming here for second time, and I'm not disappointed! My husband and I were here for dinner on the weekend. I think we were early so it wasn't jam-packed. As usual, service was very good, but we waited for longer than expected for the food. We started off with assorted appetizers, and main course Palak Paneer, Aloo paratha and onion kulcha. The breads were beyond awesome ... very soft and perfectly done. The palak paneer was a bit of a miss; I was expecting something smoother and creamier. Nevertheless, quite tasty and great service as always."}
{"text":"Just had a lunch buffet from here. The food was okay but beware not to eat pieces of steel wool you may find in your platter. If you did they will just be sorry about that. That's what just happened to me. Unfortunately this happened when I was wrapping up my lunch, God knows how many have we swallowed unknowingly. 

How could a dish cleaning steel wool piece show up with in chicken tikka masala? From my experience it is clear that it is managed by careless and irresponsible people who give zero importance to quality of food and customers. They just want paying wallets and not satisfied customers. Not even by mistake I will visit this place again or refer my friends."}
{"text":"Casual environment, nothing fancy. Delicious food. Will be coming back. Nice service. Their pistachio Khulfi was my favorite. Brother Ordered chicken Tikamasala; I don't eat meat, so I order fried veggies and okra veggies: a little too greasy for my taste, but yummy."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time, lured by the positive reviews of their lunch buffet. I am extremely happy we went. Good price, authentic atmosphere, attentive service, comfortable seating - and the food - YUM. More than half of the dishes were vegetarian. All were delicious. Not overly spicy, seasoned and cooked well and not, like some Indian food I've had before, layered in grease and oil. We will be back again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. The first time was for the lunch buffet and this was before they remodeled. The food was delicious.

So I went again during dinner. WHAT. A. MESS.

For a place nestled in a shadier neighborhood, I didn't think reservations would be necessary. When we came in, we were seated at a table that still had remnants and water glasses from the last diners. We kept trying to flag a server down, but no one would even look our way. 

I'm very patient, but not 20 minutes of no service patient. I usually give places/servers the benefit of the doubt, but it was absolutely ridiculous even after we flagged someone and they said someone would be right with us. I've never walked out of a restaurant due to bad service or even bad food, but one can only wait so long.

If my memory wasn't tarnished by that experience, I'd try the place again. Otherwise, this place needs to be aware of their diners. I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Usually a fantastic lunch buffet, and cheap! Today it wasn't quite as fresh as usual but still outstanding."}
{"text":"Tried the Indian Palace last night for the first time and found it to be very good. We had vegetable pakora, onion bhaji, mixed tandoori grill, matter paneer and a Peshawari (Kashmiri) naan. All the dishes were very good. The paneer was especially good with very good seasonings and spices. The only minor grumble was the amount of onion and green pepper (!) with the mixed grill - it was like a Tandoori Fajita - but still tasted very good. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I stop by here for lunch even though It's a bit of a drive from my workplace. The staff is friendly and the food is really good. It's always fresh and flavorful and I especially enjoy the naan. It's reasonably priced for a buffet and they make sure to stop by to fill up your water glass often."}
{"text":"India Palace has an authentic atmosphere that never feels too loud or cramped. The food is fantastic, portion appropriate and deliciousness renditions of all types of cuisine from India. Though it is a simple gesture, I absolutely love getting complimentary papadom and sauces with every meal, and then their rice is amazing (I don't even like rice) with a refreshing touch of cumin. 

The staff and hostess are always incredibly friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in the valley!  Was definitely worth the drive from Sun City West.  Tandoori chicken was moist and the vegetable pakoras outstanding.  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, we traveled how many miles from home and never expected to find as good Indian food as we have in the Bay Area, but India Place is amaze balls!!!
We got a recommendation form our Uber driver and  was he ever right.
The spices are right on point and the heat was perfect.

If you love Indian food you have to take a trip off the strip and experience India Palace!!! (And ask for Garry, he da bomb)"}
{"text":"Very good surprise. Not that easy to find a good Indian restaurant in Vegas but this one is really good. Savory, very good. We liked it and recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food, fantastic atmosphere! Our whole family loves it, especially the mango custard :)"}
{"text":"Awesome buffet! I go here every weekend. Best Indian buffet I've ever had. Lamb curry and chicken masala is fantastic. And the rice pudding is an amazing way to end a meal!"}
{"text":"Does not taste as good as Trimurti. Buffet Tandoori chicken made from the cheapest parts and not cooked properly. 

Salads are good though."}
{"text":"I've never been to India Palace, so it was on my list of places to try when in town staying at the Hard Rock. My buddy loves Indian food, so we hit up the lunch buffet today. We came at 2:45pm and they warned us they closed at 3pm, but Vic ended up letting us sit and eat until a bit after 3pm, and we didn't feel rushed at all. I though it was $12.95 for the buffet but apparently it was only $11.95. Had 2 buffets and a drink for less than the $20 for $30 Yelp voucher I had purchaed. Enjoyed all the food I tried, but the naan stood out as really good. Great value restaurant and a great vibe. Thanks, Vic!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Indian cuisine in town one of the oldest restaurant their own family does the cooking I haven't came across an Indian cuisine better than this place please try. I think India Palace is one of the only place that also serves all À la cart with the during lunch time  most others don't they only Service buffets at that time"}
{"text":"A nice Indian restaurant, little away from the strip. Courteous staff, and pleasant ambience. We ordered malai kofta, garlic naan and onion bhajia. The food was tasteful, we could have asked them to make it a little spicy..
The management should consider including a portion of rice with main entree."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative ten, I would. 
Service- super rude and obnoxious 
Delivery- 1.5 hours, even though I was told 25-45 minutes. I was not told that it is cash only. Items from the order were missing , when I called to inquire- no reaction at all
Was charged $10 for delivery, even though Yelp page showed less. 
Food- horrible; dosa was very soggy and thick. Very limited options for chutneys. Food lacks basic flavor."}
{"text":"I've been visiting India Palace for years and years. In my humble opinion, they have the best saag paneer in town. Also, in my less than humble opinion, they have the best lunch buffet in LV. 

The only reason for not giving India Palace 5-stars, is the lighting. The last few times that I've visited, the lights are up all the way during dinner service. It's nice to have a slightly dimly lit ambiance during dinner service. When I asked the sever about it, he told me that they leave the lights up because some can't read the menu if they aren't up all the way. Maybe spend $20 on a few pen lights for the 1 out of 50 people that can't read in dim light? Seems like a better solution than compromising the environment for every one else. 

Anyway, I do recommend India Palace, the food is good and consistent."}
{"text":"Josh sunny and Paul are super friendly me and my brother went one night and they remembered us just went back tonight still the best service ive had I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I went with my family to this place after reading the spectacular reviews. Also they has a $15 for $30 deal which looked good. We ordered the Mysore dosa and the Masala dosa and they were just alright. The dosas were too thick and the filling very average. The sambhar was nice, but the chutney smelled old.

The ambience is OK but place is nice and clean. They don't have too many parking spots. It took us a while to find parking at 9:00 pm. 

I would have still given 3 stars except for the behaviour of one specific staff. 

They has a free mango shake deal going on when we purchased the 15 for 30 deal. When my husband went to pay, one employee told him that he should have mentioned the free shake earlier and that he would charge us for it since we already had it. He said \"since you ate your meal already it is a done deal\".  My husband showed him the purchase receipt on his smartphone. 

Having to argue/discuss this with the employee, and put up with rubbish, when the deal is clearly posted on Yelp, was painful. My husband had to insist strongly a few times before the employee corrected the bill. 

During this process, the employee tried several wisecracks at  my husband, which of course he failed at miserably. The least we expect at a restaurant is courtesy and we do not put up with mocks and jibes at any cost. 

The person who took our order and served our meal was very respectful and kind, so was the rest of the staff. 

Will not go back or recommend this place"}
{"text":"I don't know how people rated this place 4. I think they never tried a good Indian restaurant or had tasty Indian food. We were 16 people and we ordered almost every item on the menu. Not even a single item deserves a 3 rating. 

They had cocktail menu but it's good for nothing. I tried ordering 5 different cocktail from the menu one after the other but they said none of them is available. Then why the hell they kept it in the menu I don't know.  at last I ordered sweet heaven and guess what it is sour ...LOL...They have put orange juice saying it is sweet and the worst thing ever is they even put the seeds and grounded ..making it worst and sour. 

Don't even try this restaurant. Expensive and doesn't deserve even 50% of the price. Try Californian restaurants u will get tasty food for better price."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Our server Garry was extremely helpful with helping us with the menu selections. Everyone was friendly. Food was amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious(dal tadka and malai kofta) and the staff was very good too. Very delicious food. 
I would definitely recommend this 
place."}
{"text":"The place looks shady from the outside but it's awesome on the inside. Our server was Vick and he is good at his work. The food was great and was as spicy as it could be."}
{"text":"Not at all Indian. We ordered pakoda and chicken biryani. Pakoda is not at all fresh with sour taste and chicken biryani is made with chicken curry by mixing white rice in it ( for those who don't know how it's made its big process . Chicken is marinated with masala and rice is covered over top. ) . The cook must be picked from indian road side resturant not at all authentic indian food.we are from Texas not from Las Vegas ."}
{"text":"I stopped today to try the lunch buffet.  What a great idea it was and thanks to my fellow Yelpers for their reviews that helped me make my decision.

The restaurant was almost empty when I arrived at 12:30.  Service was excellent and I know it would have been even if there were a lot of people there.

While I was looking the buffet over, the waiter brought me an iced tea as requested.  Shortly after returning to the table, another server brought me a basket of fresh naan.

Here's what I tried:

Vegetable pakora - good but not a lot of spice
goat curry - nice spice and very tasty
saag paneer with cheese - flavorful with a nice zing
basmati rice - standard
naan - plain and good
chana masala - excellent with a nice spiciness
bhindi masala - this was noted as a house favorite.  I didn't think there was anything special about the okra nor the potatoes and it lacked much flavor
navratan lorna - good
karahi lamb - nice flavor and good spice
chicken tikka masala - excellent
ras malai - excellent sweet to end this feast

Lest you worry that I cleaned the place out, let me assure you I didn't.  I took small portions of all these things just to try them.  Since I was alone, I had a great time watching the Bollywood Bang-Bang music videos on their TV screens.  

I'm anxious to come back for a relaxed dinner with friends and enjoy being served and trying some things on the evening menu that don't show on the buffet."}
{"text":"Great place.  I've had the buffet lunch here three times now and have never been disappointed.  The naan is delicious, all of the lamb dishes are incredible, and the veggie curries are top-notch.  Everything is always fresh.   The staff could be a bit more attentive, but for $8.50 a head, who could possibly complain?  Having never dined in India I can't comment on the \"authenticity\", but I have eaten at several Indian buffets in the Phoenix area and this is most certainly one of the best.  Nice modern atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo tasty and good variety! Def one of the better Indian food places I've been to."}
{"text":"India Palace just doesn't stack up to the other lunch buffets in town.

The decor is nice. (Misti mentioned MTV India on the TV, which is really cool!) The buffet selection can be more interesting than our perennial favorite, Mint. And having samosa on the buffet is always nice. But the service was sketchy and the flavors felt diluted compared to Mint or Mt. Everest.

I would really love to find a truly great Indian lunch buffet in town but this just isn't it."}
{"text":"For the price, you can't go wrong for a lunch buffet. The food is good, the service is decent and cozy place."}
{"text":"This is the closest indian place to our house so since we are new to the area we thought we would give it a shot. Let me tell you, this place did not disappoint! I had chicken korma and he had chicken tikka masala. We also got vegetable samosas and garlic naan. The food came out promptly, the decor was beautiful, the restaurant was clean and best of all our server was an absolute delight! It is in the back corner of a strip mall so don't be deterred when you can't see it from the street! It's in the same strip mall as US Egg. We definitely will come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been to several Indian restaurants before, but India Palace exceeded my expectations. The chicken tikka and aloo gobhi were rich in flavor, and complimented beautifully by the garlic naan. The staff was very friendly and helpful in answering my questions. Jatinder, presumably one of the owners, was extremely welcoming and accommodating. My sister and I had a great experience, I would highly recommend India Palace for anyone looking for a good hole in the wall restaurant."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet at a very reasonable price. It is very clean in my opinion compared to all the other Asian buffets. I also really like the taste of their Indian food. Very delicious. 

Very impressed by how friendly their staff is and attentive they are, even during lunch buffet (filling waters, refilling naan, remove used plates).

Some people address that there is not enough variety. I think ~6 different curries (and this is just curries, they have other dishes) that they have at one time is a lot but to others it is not. I somewhat understand that but this is not Las Vegas and it is $8.99. I still give it 5/5 because I am one of those people who go to a buffet and eat platefuls of what I like. They have all the essentials so I am a very satisfied, happy, person. 

They rotate the curries out but have not been able to really see a pattern."}
{"text":"We visited this Indian restaurant for their lunch buffet ($9), and came away with a positive experience. The yellow and red interior was large, dim lit, and good for groups. The buffet items were stacked in the back, followed by a bar area, TVs, booths along the perimeter, and tables located from front to back. 

Rice and vegetarian items, the meat dishes, chai, and a small salad and dessert bar culminated the buffet line. Both the White and Vegetarian Biryani were disappointing. The rice was overcooked, soggy, and had an unusual flavor. The Sagg was creamy, flavorful, could come with less grease, but still worthwhile. The Turka Dall came with a nice kick, and I really enjoyed the firm delicious Paneer that was worth the repeat. 

The Tandoori Chicken had a very pleasant smoke, and the meaty pieces came with great temperature without it being dried out. The Lamb Curry was also outstanding. The bulky pieces of Lamb were moist, flavorful, and of quality. The same could be said about the Chicken Tikka Masala. I loved the centrality of charred and smoky flavors that coupled with my vegetarian options to round out the taste buds. 

The Naan were not greasy, and the spongy textures were addictive. The dessert options were really lacking, and the Chai Tea was diluted without much flavor. For those looking for a spicy fare, I used cilantro chutney to add some unrelenting flavors to supplement the lack of heat across these dishes.

Despite the hits and misses, it was a nice discovery. Service was warm, friendly, and these practices were underscored by occasional drop off of fresh naan, and taking away our used dishes in a timely manner. Overall, the food was delicious and the quality of the meat met our expectations. The few limitations were the overcooked soggy Biryani, lackluster Chai, and options and flavors that catered to the conventional Western taste buds. Based on my experiences with other Indian restaurants in the area, this is one place that is worth of returning."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and never disappointed. We took the kids, one of which is very picky. She ate an entire order of chicken tandoori. I was a little disappointed with the palak paneer, which is my favorite. Just didn't seem the same as usual. Service is always great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 4 for the evening and I would have to say that my lunch experience in the past was much more enjoyable.  The evening dinner was good but not worth the price that we pooled together in the end.  The place was clean, staff was friendly, and food okay.  

But seriously, it's like night and day when you compared lunch buffet and dinner (literally).  But for the evening we ordered Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Skeeh Kaboob, Pudina Masala, and Goat Curry.  I tasted them all and my favorite dish was the Masala, it had a nice sauce that really gave it flavor."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Had the obligatory chicken tikka masala and the paneer tikka masala, veg samosas, plain naan, papadums.  All very good!!  Ordered two desserts (kheer and the little honey donut balls) and they were five bucks each for two tiny donuts and a very small kheer.  That was sort of ridiculous for a $10 delivery fee and a 20% tip added at the time of ordering.  So I highly recommend the food - but the desserts are extremely overpriced.  I would most definitely order the entrees again though."}
{"text":"Amazing. I keep going back for more. I'm in love! It is soooo delicious. That in itself is an understatement. The servers are so sweet and always give us a new dessert same to try after our meal! One of my favorite restaurants EVER!"}
{"text":"5-star Tandoori fish and Chicken Tikka masala. Tandoori fish literally melted in our mouths. Chicken Tikka masala was cooked in the right amount of butter, giving it a rustic Indian taste. Will definitely go again.

Staff was very friendly (and is extra-attentive to customers who wield the Yelp app). I also bought a 40% discount deal through the Yelp app. 

Food portions were adequate. No surprises there.

Typical Indian restaurant ambience."}
{"text":"Fast service. Ordered the Chicken Makhani, naan, and the shrimp masala. Got medium spicy on the chicken and shrimp and they perfect. The waiter was super helpful and very nice as was the rest of the staff. Will definitely be back and do the buffet sometime. They were very patient with my son who is autistic. 

Edit: they gave my son mango ice cream on the house that was really good and very sweet of them to do."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Great (tender) lamb! Very cool naans(mozzarella; lamb).  I'm not crazy abt the shrimp my dinner mate ordered(a tad too 'medium' in texture)... But who orders (nonfish) Indian seafood? 

Manny was a great server! I'll be back when I crave lamb."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, this was my first time having Indian food.  I was a little worried because I'm not too sure I like curry.  Didn't think I would like Indian food, but my mother-in-law wanted to do the lunch buffet for her birthday.  She and her husband spent a year and a half in India.

Wow!  With the exception of some chick pea salad thing, I liked everything on the buffet, and I basically tried everyting.  The Chicken tikka marsala or \"butter chicken\" was so yum.  My mom-in-law called around trying to find a lunch buffet with this dish and only India Palace had it, so score!  I also really liked the spinach.  Not sure what was in it, but it had a spicy kick.  There were also these vegetable fritter things which were great.  Sorry, I can't be more descriptive, but I was overwhelmed!

The service was great.  I believe the owner was waiting on us and he talked to the in-laws about India and really made it a good experience.  Cute decor.  Parking is tight.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  If you enjoy Indian food this is a must.  I always get chicken tikka masala, they manage to get the spice (I go very hot) factor just right to my liking. Staff is great and the prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"We're followed India Palace a they've changed locations they're that good.  WONDERFUL Sunday brunch!  The food is always fresh and hot. Tastier Chai and mango lassis.

Menu selections are great too.  Make the drive!"}
{"text":"As far as Indian goes this is by far the best I have had this side of the Atlantic Ocean.  My mum makes good Indian but I think this is great indian.  Very filling, just the right spices and curry to make the meal taste just right."}
{"text":"This place is open pretty late. Tucked in the corner of the center, India palace is a good place to go to for Indian food. I ordered the chicken tikka masala plate with a side of rice. The rice is well cooked and the spice in it is very fresh. The chicken tikka masala is different from the usual ones I've had. It's sweeter and the part of the chicken is different than the chunks you get elsewhere. It's very soft and retains the taste of the chicken well. 

The sweetness is kind of odd but it is interesting. I don't have a big sweet tooth so I would prefer it to have had a stronger spice taste instead. That being said, the sweetness did complement the sauce well. 

Pros: 
- They give you a lot of rice. 
- You can choose how spicy the dishes are. I love that. 
- It has a really good Indian feel to it. It doesn't feel fake or a front. 

Cons:
- The fans!!!! Holy Molly.  The ceiling fans spin around under the lights. So you have a shadow of the moving fan moving in a strobe like effect. Gave me a headache. 
- Not really a con but could be annoying to some: the TV was quite loud and distracting with Indian music videos. I don't mind myself. I feels like it gives it a homey vibe. 

Bottom line:
Good food and wonderful service. They came up to my table just enough time to show me that they were attentive without feel like I was being smothered. Honestly it would be a five star if it weren't for the strobe light effect. It's not just good you have to take into account but the surroundings as well!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is a good value for what you get. Service however can be improved especially when it comes to attentiveness and warm, welcoming mood of the place. If the service was better I can see myself coming here on a regular basis. However, I think I will continue my quest for a better Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"The Saag Paneer is fantastic!! The spices are perfectly blended, but I was bummed they sent the appetizers (we got takeout) in a Styrofoam container so everything was soggy and not that tasty. In spite of the appetizer drawback the customer service is impeccable! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I went out to dinner and was in search of Indian food a couple of weeks ago.  I decided to try this place because there was a coupon available.  I ordered Chicken Vindaloo, Garlic Naan and some rice.  The food was fantastic, and I asked for extra spicy- frequently I have issues with restaurants not making the food spicy enough but they did a great job here at India Palace without ruining the flavor.  Also, the server, Mani, was fantastic!  Great attitude, good humor and took care of me the entire time.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We recently moved up to Sunnyslope, so the search was on for a new Indian Restaurant and India Palace was it.  We enjoyed it so much that when they moved over to the new location on Bell Road we followed.  

They have all the typical Indian fare, although we only eat the veggie stuff so I can't comment on the meat dishes.  Their Mali Kofta is wonderful with amazing sauce including cashews and raisins and they are more than willing to add Paneer to your Aloo Matter (if you're into that kind of thing).  Great samosas and pakoras, and if you go for dinner they will start you off with some Poppadums and salsa with chutney.  

I think India Palace has one of the best Indian Buffets, but that is mainly based off the fact that their buffet always includes a large selection of veggie dishes, almost more than the meat selection! They also always have some interesting selections that you may not see on the menu like Chili Tofu and Curried Pasta.  It's all you can eat including the naan and hot Indian Tea.  Its always busy at lunch time and there is a reason why.

It is located in the corner of a strip mall, but once you enter you wouldn't know thats where you were, as the restaurant itself is very nice on the inside.  The staff is very friendly and if you go as often as we do you will get to know them all because they are always there!!

They also have restaurants in Sedona and Flagstaff, although I recently heard they were going to be selling those and just keep the one in Phoenix. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet this time and I was meh, okay. 

No much food selection but I did get to try a few new things that I liked. 

Service sucks of course and there is one waiter that I just do not like because of his personality I guess. Just seems like he doesn't give a shit but it's probably like going to a chinese place and the waitress being mean because that's just their personality. He wasn't mean or anything, just seemed like he wasn't interested in helping or that I was annoying him."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome. The selections of traditional Indian favorites are here. The spice mixes are here. They serve chai iced tea! They use real Indian paneer for their cheese naan. It is in a strip mall but I am not going to knock a star for that. I've never had lamb as tender as that in North America. It appears that they also have a traditional tandoor (the breads and tandoori chicken seemed authentic) this is the real deal for Indian in the valley. One other thing, it's very reasonable. Love it"}
{"text":"Super nice family run business with great food.  Not much else that I could ask for!  

I came here once to order take out during lunch and regretted it almost immediately because there was an awesome buffet with already made food that would've been much cheaper and quicker.  The next time we came for the buffet and had a great time.  My favorite was probably the chicken curry.  The best part is that the buffet also comes with unlimited plain and garlic naan!

The people that own this place are really nice and friendly.  They really took care of us."}
{"text":"Terrible place.. They charge for a buffet which hardly has variety. Waste of money. Save yourself from going there. On top of it the food tastes bad."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place, so I gave it a try the other night.

It is located in a ghetto area, not very safe to walk around, good thing is they have very close parking.

The chicken tandoori was very decent I really liked it as well as the briyani, but the fish which is their specialty as stated on the menu, tasted terrible. I barely ever send food back at the restaurant but I had to this time. The guy was nice about it they took it back and took it out of the check.
I also heard their lunch buffet is very good so maybe I'll stop by one day to try that but probably not for the menu."}
{"text":"Food is very good, the owners are great,     but The Manager was unprofessional.  He may no longer be there..    We ordered a Groupon   and called in and explained that we had a groupon worth $30  and ordered  some food to go.  I clearly explained my groupon... and there was no problem with the TO Go order from the employee on the phone who was polite.

 After driving 20 Miles.... we arrived.  The manager said the Groupon is for dining in only.  I said... why did they not tell me that on the phone... as I told them I had a Groupon.... anyway... he did not want to  honor the promotion.. then I asked him his name... and he wouldn't tell me his name... He said they don't make any money on the Groupon...

 I said...then why do you offer it?   .... that is not my problem.... I bought it... ordered. and then drove 20 miles... and now he is not wanting to honor the promotion.   

Did you read the fine print ?  he asked..No I said.... instead, I called your restaurant and explained that I had a Groupon and they took my order.... and I in good faith came all this way expecting a smile and a thank you... and now I get a No.... and he was very  mean to me... disrespectful... not being considerate at all...

Of course this upset me..... and I began to raise my voice..... Then he was upset that I raised my voice in his restaurant.... I told him... I did not come here to raise my voice... I came here for some Tikka Masala... but I will never come here again... trust me.....

It is unfortunate... that they have such good food here....yet... the Manager is a hothead, and I feel sorry for the employees that have to work for him.  The poor guy that took my order... oh my.... he is going to get the wrath!

He did not want to listen to anything I said.... In spite of it all I still tipped him $3 just because I am someone that has worked in the Restaurant industry, and I follow the golden rule... but I will tell you, this Manager was a real jerk.

Now....there are  so many restaurants out there that would love to have a customer that drives 20 miles to come to them... and they will do everything in their power to make that customer feel special.  

This manager  threatened to call the Police on me... can you believe that?    Wow...
If he worked for me I would fire him so fast..... 

Anyway.... This is a good restaurant and they have good food... and I am sure the owners are good people..... They need to help their people understand the promotions, and then make sure that every customer interaction is  appreciated. 
  
I really like the food... It is unfortunate that I have had so much grief here....  I blame the Manager... No CS skills whatsoever.... :(

Anyway... I do think this is a good restaurant...

The owner call me up after this an apologized for the experience I had.  I thanked him for the call.   This is a lovely restaurant, and the food is fantastic.....I say go ahead and give them another chance...."}
{"text":"Really good for this type of Indian buffet. Plenty of selection, they keep the naan coming, and there are enough people eating there to turn the food over. We actually walked into another local place offering a buffet, just to try it, but after taking a look we turned around and came here. There's no need to try and upgrade!"}
{"text":"Never order again paneer:I don't see any paneer at all and they only put carrot and cali-flower ."}
{"text":"Well...

On a whim my friends and I were looking for a good place to eat and someone suggested India Palace. Having heard the good reviews over the years, we decided to give it a try. I checked the yelp app on my phone and saw that with 'check-in' on the app you get 1 free appetizer or cocktail with purchase. The reviews were also favorable so in we went. We arrived at 5pm and the place was seemingly in between shifts so we were sat promptly. 

I noticed on signage that there were Happy Hour specials until 6pm so I asked the hostess about them. She replied, \"Happy Hour? Why not? .. You can get buy 1 get one free on appetizers. \" Great, It was about the same as the deal on the app so we ordered. 

We had Veggie and Lamb Samosas, very nice as well as a few other items including garlic naan bread, Chicken Briyani, (Chicken mixed with Basmati rice with spices, cashews & vegetables) and Chicken Tikka Masala, (Tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt & spices, simmered in a creamy tomato sauce.) Pretty standard stuff. We even opted for some traditional desserts and Indian Beer.

All in all the food was really good and tasty and I was very satisfied and full. Service was a bit off, but I think that may have been due to the language barrier, and sometimes the server would suggest an item, and then bring something else. In this case he offered a couple of different beers and then brought something altogether different. It wasn't a huge deal as the beers were good and 3 of us were sharing so they went fast.

What was strange was when the bill arrived, I asked again about the Happy Hour specials, as the bill had not been adjusted. Our server was no where to be found and the server presenting the check had no idea what I was talking about. I got up to ask the hostess that seated us about the specials, (she was the one that said \"why not\",) and she acted as though she didn't know what I was talking about.. then reluctantly adjusted the bill. 

The 'new' server brought over the adjusted bill and seemed pretty aggravated at me. Possibly for asking about the discount? I don't know but it was not a happy presentation of the new check. We paid and left. 

I would go again, possibly for a buffet situation, as I wasn't completely satisfied with the service, but the food was very good. I think at least one of my friends wouldn't return due to the service. We weren't asking much but the hasty and unhappy presentation of out adjusted bill kind of put us off a bit. Like I said though, we liked the food, so who knows :)

You should know that India Palace is on a very sketchy part of Twain Ave. It is literally always surrounded by police cars and as we pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant. No less than 4 police cars with sirens blaring were pulling 3 guys out of a car next door and had them pinned to the ground at gunpoint. I mention it, because I know the neighborhood well, and this has to be one of the less savory sections. I just wouldn't want a tourist to stop in and be surprised but commotions such as an arrest at gunpoint in a connecting parking lot.

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times food is usually ok, on our last visit we found 2 hairs in our food, one in the rice and one in our sag chicken... we will not be going back. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Yep. Chicken tikki masala, chicken wings, garlic naan, and Manny our waiter, all top notch."}
{"text":"I am not a regular yelp reviewer but this place is worth to review...impressed with the customer service, and taste of the fish biryani and appetizers were so good"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've ever had!  Our waiter Vick was amazing!  I have celiac disease and cannot eat gluten. .. He took excellent care of us. I wish I could bring him AND the food back to Reno with me!"}
{"text":"Ah, the site of my first Indian experience.  I remember it fondly.  It may have been almost two years ago but the taste of curry lingers long in my soul.  It was a rainy night in October of 2010 and I had a Groupon half priced offer.  So I grabbed a friend and went.  He had tried Indian previously and knew to order the garlic naan.  Delicious.  He ordered Tikka Masala.  I ordered Chicken Sagwala.  Both were quite good.  I ordered mine with medium spice.  It provided that great warming sensation without being too spicy.  Though I did need some Tums shortly after.  The meal started with the aforementioned naan as well as something I can best describe as Indian chips and salsa.  Crispy little pieces of flat bread with three different sauces.  One was very strong with the red chili flavor.  One was heavy on the mint.  The third I recall as being sweeter and almost fruity.  All very good.  I was surprised at how much food I received.  I was very full afterwards.  I had to walk around the Boulevard Mall for a while before continuing on the my next stop (see my review for Hofbrauhaus).  After eating at India Palace, I knew I was hooked.  The flavors are intense but balanced so well.  I drive by some times when in the University neighborhood and I am always tempted to stop in. I am usually short on time and cash though.  In any case, the food was great when I went.  The service was okay.  The restaurant was clean and comfortable.  A good first experience."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST Indian food around the strip and possibly in all of vegas. Garry, the guy in there is simply amazing with his service. The place has an excellent ambience unlike the run off the mill kind elsewhere in the strip area. This is excellence par excellence and the tastiest indian food you will ever have in the vegas area. Thumbs up 5 star. Their raja masala, motor paneer and saag paneer along with aloo paratha, spinach paratha, peas pulao and veg biryani are all must have, even if you miss one of those, you are meal is incomplete. Then you have a salted Lassi and that's the best finish to this amazing meal."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I was initially a little bit skeptical because we were the only ones there and it was nearly 5 PM. However we went in and as a result of the limited amount of people in there we had a really good service and we also had really good food! We had hey lentil stew or soup and vegetable biryani and garlic naan. All of which was very good. We will gladly go again."}
{"text":"We are from Salt Lake City, UT and wanted to take our host out for Indian food.  He never tried it before, and he really enjoyed it!

We ordered samosas, garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, chicken coconut korma, and saag paneer. The favorite at the table was the masala followed by the coconut korma. The saag paneer had a bit too much spinach flavor and not enough of any other flavor.  I love the saag paneer at Bombay house in Salt Lake!  

The rice we chose was the one with onions, peas, and cashews. If I lived here and visited again, which I would, I would choose the plain basmati.  

The atmosphere was nice as well as the server.  She was very helpful and gave suggestions.

What I really appreciated was that when we arrived, an Indian family was leaving, and while we ate, two other Indian families arrived for dinner.  If they like it...it's where I want to eat!

Overall, a nice place with great food. I would return. If you visit Utah, try Bombay House!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Indian food. It was delicious. They have great service and even better food! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I couldn't leave the restaurant before writing this review ...
It's amazing and vick ( the waiter ) is so professional. 
Food is hot and delicious ..prices are good .
Good place ..I recommend it ."}

{"text":"It's sad to walk into a restarting in which you are treated as if your money is no good. I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat during a lunch break from a work seminar I was attending at the hard rock. I picked this place because it was the first that showed up on yelp. My boyfriend and I drove over and the parking lot was empty. We walked inside and the waiter that greeted us seemed alarm we were there. He reluctantly gave us a menu. I put in my order and the waiter handed me a receipt and stated it was my check without having swiped my card. I didn't understand what this meant, so I asked should I swipe my card. The waiter again said the paper he handed me was my check and stared at me funny. I still didn't understand so I gave him my card. The waiter swiped it aggressively and stated it was declined. The waiter did the same thing with my boyfriend's card. My boyfriend finally asked the waiter could he do the swiping himself and guess what? Card approved! The food was absolutely delicious, but the customer service lacked tremendously. The 2 stars are for the food tasting so good. If you're not Indian, I wouldn't suggest visiting this restaurant. Seems like they only would like to cater to their kind and not all."}
{"text":"Delicious! They also have a lunch buffet,  which I hope to try some day.  We will definitely be visiting Indian Palace more often."}
{"text":"Was are first time trying Indian food .
I have to say it was very different..

We didn't know much of what to order , it would of been nice if our waiter would of helped , and guide us .
But he did speak much English , I felt like he didn't want to bother , or didn't know what the best dishes were for first timers . 
We will definitely come back and try the buffet, so we can try many options next time ..

The lamb chops were to die for .. 
the service was great"}
{"text":"I don't get why other people left 4 or 5 stars for his place. We used groupon and ordered lunch. We ordered the chicken tikka and goat curry. For the prices, $14.95 and $15.95, respectively, we would assume that the meal came with rice. When we got the orders, the serving sizes were small and the chicken is not even a full breast. They charge $7.98 for the rice and $2.95 for the nan bread.  Ridiculous prices for such small serving sizes. Very disappointed. I think it is because we used groupon. If we paid full for the buffet of $12.95,  then it is worth it. Please do not use groupon for this restaurant, they rip you off."}
{"text":"We all enjoyed the food at India Palace.  It was the best Indian food we ever had.  The service was also great.  My girlfriend had the Tandoori Dinner and I had the Mixed Curry Dinner.  Both had real wonderful flavors and soaked everything up with naan.  We had a separate order of raita.  I don't think it came with our dinner dishes.  Overall, we had great experience and the food was just wonderful.  We would visit again when we return to Vegas."}
{"text":"Typical Indian restaurant Catering to the American Community and who does not respect their own people. My elderly dad just asked him if they serve halal and did not hear the reply.When asked again he answered rudely and was asked to leave the restaurant if we did not believe that they serve halal. The manager boasts about his 17 years experience but too bad he needs to work on his customer service. Food is good but very bad service. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Worst food, vvvv spicy very bad attitude not ready to admit  their fault looks like they don't care for business"}
{"text":"I've eaten Indian food all over the world including the famous curry mile in Manchester, England and India Palace is some of the best I've ever had. My mom and I shared the  onion naan (slightly spicy?), paneer masala, Murgh makhani (butter chicken) and the vegetable pulao rice. Tons of food, even took home leftovers, and very reasonably priced which is great as Indian food tends to be pretty pricey generally. I had a glass of Malbec and she had lemonade. We walked out for $22/ea and they even brought us a couple of small complimentary deserts to share! 
Service was exceptional, I think our server was one of the owners. She checked several times to make sure we were enjoying the food. I told her it was some of the best I had ever had and she said \"if there is ever anything not to your liking please just let us know and we will fix it\"! The only drawback for them is they are in the corner of a strip mall and a bit hidden. Well worth the \"hunt\" though! Also the restaurant was very clean, including the restrooms (way important to me), and had lovely colorful decor. They even show Bollywood movies on the very unobtrusive tv :-)
I live in Charlotte, NC but my family is in AZ, I will have a hard time not making them take me to India Palace every time I visit!"}
{"text":"India Palace hit the spot right on the head. We had the Chicken Vindaloo, garlic naan, and Lamb Tikka Massala. They'll ask you for the spiciness level and on scale of 1-10, we got a 9 and it really wasn't that bad. Add on the house sauces and we were stuffed and satiated. The only problem here was using the Yelp deal ($15 for $30) -- perhaps it came at a point of confusion for the manager and waiters but it took a little bit for the deal to be honored. In the end, it was all fine. Just be careful to have your voucher information and yelp deal marked as redeemed to show them as proof."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great food, decent prices,& very fancy inside !
Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was excited to try this place. Arrived and found the place nice if typical. Buffet was small but had substance. The rice was perfect but the dishes I tried did not quite hit the mark. Potatoes were mushy and did not have much flavor. The chicken tikka masala was made up of both white and dark meat. I like being warned of this in advance because I prefer my dishes to contain white meat. The sauce was also different tasting. However, the naan that was served was good and the raiti and chutney were delish."}
{"text":"No idea how authentic this place is but regardless, the food was good. The nan bread was a little on the thick side and chewy but everything else was very good. We had an assortment of appetizer plate which was nice plus the chicken korma which I thought was real good. The other thing we got was an assorted sizzling plate of various meats like chicken and lamb with veg tables served like fajitas. The prices were very reasonable and the service was good so that's good enough for me."}

Better yet...don't seat us in the first place have the courtesy to just say sorry we are closed. BTW there were only a handful of others present..."}
{"text":"when an indian woman gushes to me about an indian restaurant, i usually take her word for it and rush over there and expect a good meal. 
i mean, i just assumed that she should get to decide what good indian food was. 

anyway, that's not the point. 
after we paid and we were waiting for a cab, a bunch of men standing by the door gave us a handful of seed looking things from the restaurant counter. they put a handful in their mouth and chewed with glee! and told us to eat it! and it tasted like soap/pepper seeds! and i kept thinking, \"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! WHY DID I JUST EAT THAT?!\"

anyway, that's not the point either. 

THE POINT IS: 
i forgot the left over chicken ticca in the trunk of my car. 
for two days. 
BUT AFTER TWO DAYS IT WAS TOTALLY FINE AND MY DAD STILL ATE IT AND SAID IT WAS GOOD!

{"text":"Food was awesome, but this place is kind of expensive ($13 for a Vegetarian dish). We ended up paying $55+ for three Vegetarian dishes, garlic naan and a side of rice, plus a Mojito and a mango lassie (I will say that their mango lassie is a killer! Loved it.) But, in order not to pay so much, take advantage of Yelp's deal! ($15 for $30!). We've used it and the price came out reasonable."}

{"text":"I am bumping up my rating to 5 stars because this is my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix. We have had a lot of Indian restaurants pop up in our neighborhood but we make the 15 minute drive because the food is so much better than the places close to us. Palak paneer and malai kofta are still my favorites. My husband has recently fell in love with their butter chicken. The last few times we have been there, the service was excellent. My only complaint is I walk out of their stuffed! We buy 3 dishes and have every intention of saving some for leftovers but the food is so good we just keep eating!"}
{"text":"I had the buffet today. I don't think I can give a fair comprehensive review til I've ordered from the menu. Buffet is a different animal, ey? 

But the buffet was damn good. I don't eat much meat, but I just drizzled the sauces from the meat dishes all over my rice and sopped up with naan (flat bread). I agree with the other reviews that the naan was a little burnt, but maybe that's intentional? It was still fluffy and I kind of like my foods on the charred side anyways. Adds character. The naan is not on the buffet line, but a waiter will drop it on your table, I'm assuming so it doesn't dry out under the lamps of the buffet. Nice touch, Indians. 

The meatball sauce was awesome, on the sweet side and I went back for seconds and thirds. The saag paneer (spinach and cheese) was also good. But the paneer cubes were scant. 

The Kahari Goat (house favorite) was a little on the salty side, but still good. On the dinner menu, this dish is $15. 

The kheer (rice pudding) was good, too. Not too sweet, but still sweeter than others I've had. 

Their samosas were okay (I like Samosa Factory's mo bettah). They offer a couple different chutneys. Cilantro and ... mango maybe?

They also served raita, chicken tandoori, aloo tikki (little fried potato chunks, like Indian tater tots), and mango custard. Everything I had was yummy. 

They have a fat seafood menu, too, but no seafood dishes were offered in the buffet. At least not when we went. 

Their dinner menu looks out of control good. I'm gonna have to go back. A lot. 

The buffet had a really good variety for only $13. 

Manfriend got a salt lassi, which was not too salty. $2-3. 

For two buffets and one drink, the bill came out to $30. 

The restaurant is in a free-standing building on Twain, east of Paradise. Dangerously close to school. Small parking lot. 

The interior was surprisingly well-decorated. There's elaborate wood carvings and Indian illustrations decorating the walls. The walls are painted flat planes of colors, similar to Indian spices. The restaurant is pleasantly under lit. They don't just sport the name \"fine Indian cuisine\" for fun. Tables are elegantly set up with linens and all that fancy crap. Waitstaff is nicely dressed in uniform. 

The bar is constructed with a solid dark wood and there's a large flat screen behind the bar playing shitty Bollywood movies, no audio. 

The nice decor is surprising because most authentically ethnic restaurants are designed as an after thought. Like in old country. 

When we went in (lunch time on a Monday), we were only the second party. By the time we left, there were about eight parties.

The garlic naan was delicious as well, we had to order a second serving.

{"text":"My husband and I have been here many times ever since discovering this place and I have to say it is hands down the best Indian food around!!! we always come on Sunday's because they offer the buffet... it's only $9 a person and well worth it! they change around some of the curries but they always have the lamb curry and chicken masala which are my favorite! the flavors are amazing and not too spicy depending on who is making it that day... if you already love Indian food.. you're going to love it even more.. and if this is your first time.. prepare to be wowed! Make sure you order the garlic naan!!! Definitely our favorite place to eat!!! and my daughter loves their rice pudding! :)"}
{"text":"Great food, being that I'm indian and have had my fair share of Indian food over the years.  The staff is friendly enough, no real quips there.  They did take a while after dropping off the check to come back and pick it up, but nothing major.  Water was filled constantly which was good.  The one star taken off was for parking.  There are very few spots and its kinda weird trying to get out as you drive around back and through the trash area if you park on the side.  But nothing major.  Still worth checking out."}
{"text":"For me, this place is never a bad choice...AND they've always got AWESOME Bollywood vids playing."}
{"text":"This place is dirty!! I agree with the another reviewer that the floor was sticky. The food was bland and not authentic. Avoid this place it's in a really ghetto area and the food just sucks!! Worst Indian food ever!"}
{"text":"Best place in Las Vegas for Indian food. I have tried them all. Trust me."}
{"text":"Good Indian buffet that isn't too far off the strip. 

The good:
-I had lunch and the buffet was $14, I think. 
-Buffet came with fresh naan brought to your table (as opposed to other buffets where the naan has been sitting in a pan on the steam table forever)
-Baliwood movies playing on TVs - very fun atmosphere (but not too chaotic)
-Very clean, newer looking, cool (temperature-wise), easy parking
-Several different meat options, including lamb, tandoori chicken, and a couple of other chicken in sauce options, as well as saag paneer (I have been to several buffets where there is a single meat option so this made me happy)
-Their rice pudding has almonds and some other stuff that I had not had before - very much enjoyed that!
-Good table service and attention as far as removing plates and keeping my water glass full 

The bad:
-not really anything about the food or service - but even though it is close to the strip, it isn't really walking distance (and I don't even know if I would call that a bad thing....)"}
{"text":"So I know it's cliche`, when talking about a certain ethnic dining establishments, to refer to the food as \" it's good, but not as good as indian food in India! \" Although lame to say all the time, in some cases it is true. I have been to India and the food was probably the best thing about the trip, seriously. Luckily India Palace does a pretty good job - for being in Phoenix, AZ anyway.

This is on my lunch rotation as it's close to the office. A few of us hit the buffet every once in awhile and I must say it's always very consistent quality wise. while changing up the menu items every time we dine. 

The buffet is small as others have mentioned but I think this has an appeal. I feel it helps keeps the quality, flavors, etc consistent and everything fresher. They always have more then a few vegetarian and vegan items to fill up on and service is always prompt and friendly.

This place is easy to miss tucked back into a hard hit(read lots of open, leaseable space) strip mall in NW Phoenix but worth stopping in for some almost-authentic indian grub."}
{"text":"I was bought here a while ago with a friend. I've never eaten Indian food. I'm hooked. This buffet style lets you check out other flavored and spices. I'd come here before 3:00 pm. The buffet starts going down hill. I've never ordered off the menu. Why? When you have so many great flavored at the buffet. I like this place. It's clean cheap and good. So many flavor hit you palette it's not even funny. I'd recommend this place to at least try it out. Olmoosedog out."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a wonderful experience. It's located in a seedy part of the road, but it is a find. You know when there's a limo in the parking lot, that's a clue.

They have an extensive menu, so we tried the Aloo Tikki appetizer, and it was four tasty fried cakes and very good. Then, we ordered the basic items we use to tell one restaurant from another.

The Lamb Korma is great, with more lamb than most others, and the lamb is very tasty and tender. There is enough sauce, so you can have just sauce and rice, too. Yummy. The Chicken Tikki Marsala is very tender, again with more chicken than usual. Very good sauce. The garlic naan is perfect. Very lightly crispy on the surface, and chewy inside, with a dusting of herbs for good looks. 

You know, every dish here is pretty, too.

They make a firm vodka martini, and the recommended Taj Mahal beer was just right.

Good service, very attentive, and \"Auntie Tarala\" will tell you with a lift of her eyebrow if you get it right. The charming manager stopped by to answer questions, and be sure we were happy. We were.

So you can have a lovely Indian meal,  at a reasonable price, without the noise and crowds of the strip, just 15 minutes away.in an easy drive. The parking is a free lot."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and I have to say that they have the best chicken tikka masala. My hubby always has the chicken karahi, he loves the sauce. With that we had the peas pulao and the plain naan. We just don't get enough. On top of that they are on restaurant.com. The service is always good. Friendly servers."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. They are very accommodating and friendly. Definitely q new fan favorite when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is great!We are from California and recently moved to Arizona and it's hard to find good non chain restaurants with good tasting food in Arizona.Their food is amazing, good portions, prices to be expected but not too much, and complimentary rice pudding!They also have a buffet.Their service is friendly and the restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere.We love the rice pudding, chicken tikka masala, rice, garlic naan, chicken tandoori, and saag chicken."}
{"text":"One of the only places I go to for Indian food. I always do the buffet & it always good. The food is so good & the people are so nice! If you're looking for a good Indian restaurant this is it!"}
{"text":"Really expected great things from the friendly looks of the Palace outside.

This is the perfect example of a hole in the wall. You would never expect to find a restaurant so fancy inside from where these guys are located. They have a wonderful set up inside including a full bar that not many hidden restaurants have to offer. 

Upon ordering takeout...
Looking through their menu, most of the entrees were ranging as low as $14. That doesn't even include rice or any other side dish, which is an additional $6. So I ordered the Lamb Curry with a side of rice and Garlic Naan. Everything was delicious and had the perfect amount of kick. To be on the picky side though, I have to complain about my Lamb being really tough and the pieces were just too large to be eaten. I had to cut every piece into 3 before eating it. Not to mention there were only about 4 pieces in the Curry itself. Like always with Indian food, I enjoyed the Naan the most by dipping it in the Curry sauce and downing it with the free Mango Lassie received upon checking in (which I \"forgot\" to redeem hehe).

Staff was really friendly, greeted me as I walked in and sure love Yelpers that stop by to eat! They were all up on my phone when they seen the noticeable Yelp App. asking about what I was going to write about, it was funny lol. In the end i do have to say that prices were higher than expected for the quality and quantity of food prepared."}
{"text":"Best place EVER!!
The,food, the people...they make you feel at home. 

You just have to try it to believe it. I crave the food when I'm not there more than once a week. No lie!!"}
{"text":"Very nice quiet place and clean. The food is tasty. And good service. I recommend it for you"}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet today and was thoroughly satisfied. I've been here before but it's been a while. It was among the best Indian buffet meals I've had recently. I've given a few other Indian buffets 4 stars but this one is a notch above. 

All of the entrees were flavorful. They had curry lamb, you don't see that often on a buffet. The curry chicken was unique and delicious. The Tandoori chicken was moist. I liked all of the assorted vegetable entrees. The lentils were great, and I liked the sauteed cabbage and their version of spinach. They also have a small fresh salad bar. 

I especially liked the dessert. The gulab juman was on point. It was nicely chilled and cooked perfectly like a cake doughnut soaked in syrup. Some places make them too dense and serve them warm ! Craziness. I sampled the rice pudding too and it was excellent. I only drank water but I noticed they have a full bar. I might try them for dinner some time.

When I was done eating, I washed my hands in the bathroom and it was immaculate inside. That's always nice to see."}
{"text":"Great food - Chicken Tikka was delicious.  They ran out of the beer we were drinking and ran across the street to get more!  Great service, great food - definitely check this place out. 

Manny was a big teddybear - thanks guys!"}
{"text":"It was okay, Not many items on the menu. They werent fresh either. May be because we went little late for lunch buffet, the food was dried up!"}
{"text":"Good food and huge menu, but service isn't always as responsive as it could be."}
{"text":"The taste went down or they were just having a bad day. Their butter chicken and chicken tikka looked the same and tasted same ?? I would really tell them to figure out the taste because prices are a bit high for the quality I got last time."}
{"text":"**THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BUFFET ONLY**

After reading the reviews of this place, I was lead to believe it is the best Indian place in Vegas.  After eating here my thoughts are:

1) This is the only Indian place in Vegas--not likely
2) People in Vegas have never had good Indian food
3) People in Vegas don't know what good Indian food is.

My thinking is either 2 or 3.

The food:  An assortment of curries which all lack that usual tasteful magicness found in Indian cuisine.  The consistency was fine (I've been to some places that have real watery curries) but the blending of spices came out bland and not good.  The naan although fluffy tasted like burnt popcorn.  I have to say the one saving grace was the rice pudding (kheer) was actually quite good...I went back for seconds.

The atmosphere:  typical for an Indian restaurant.  My water glass was filled at appropriate times, they had pleasant light music playing (as opposed to obnoxious Bollywood videos), and the decor is fine.  I have to say I did not venture into the bathroom as I was afraid for my life.

The next time I am in Vegas I will skip this one."}
{"text":"India Palace has been voted best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas by The Zagat survey every year since 2001 and it has been described to me by Indians as the most authentic restaurant we have. I've dined there a handful of times to see if I agree.

Although I wouldn't normally want to hang out on East Twain, one of the city's most dangerous areas, I will always take unnecessary risks for good food. The restaurant sticks out as the only kept up, interesting piece of architecture in that area, so it's hard to miss.

You will forget about the exterior surroundings upon entering as the decor is immediately welcoming. The walls are painted in warm, cheery earth tones that are beautifully complemented by heavy amber drapes and rich, dark woods. There is a comfortable full-service bar you can enjoy a drink at before your meal, making India palace stand out from many of its competitors.

My favorite thing to get here is the dosa, a thin pancake made from chickpeas. It is of such great diameter that it must be folded upon itself so it can almost fit on your plate, and it is eaten by tearing off more reasonably sized pieces. The only other place I've seen dosa is at India Masala in the Riviera (same owners, I believe), so I highly recommend ordering it here. You can have your dosa stuffed with an incendiary potato filling, or get the plain Papper Dosa, which I prefer (both $10.95). It is served with an addictive coconut 'chutney,' which is more like a coconut puree, and sambar, a tangy tamarind based soup/dip. Even without the accompaniments, the dosa serves as a fantastic vehicle for eating your main selections and proves to be an interesting alternative to naan.

The Chicken Tikka Masala ($14.95) and Mushroom Matar ($12.95) are fantastic, but I think the chef's abilities stand out most in the Lamb Rogan Josh ($15.95). The tomato broth is reminiscent of an authentic, slow-cooked Italian marinara that has been spiked with exotic spices, and the flavors continuously evolve in your mouth, revealing the sauce's complexity. The lamb is perfectly tender to boot, and hasn't a hint of the gaminess that can come with lower quality cuts.

So, is India Palace the best Indian restaurant in town? I can't affirmatively say yes (I had a spinach soup that was inedible and they don't use many fresh veggies in their lunch buffet), but it is definitely a contender."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for the good reviews. I went here for a business meeting 8-13-2010. I ate soo much I hurt myself. Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry. The staff was excellent and very kind. I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone. ;)"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was decent but I know three other Indian restaurants within a mile that have food that is better than anything I ate here."}
{"text":"This restaurant was delicious. I can't recall the food I ordered, but I know that I ordered an appetizer, main dish, and tea. I was able to taste all the spices that was in the dishes. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd BEST Indian food EVER! We've been to the Middle East and had true Indian food and experienced the full cultural effect. Anyhow, we live in Orange County, Ca. and eat here every time we come to Vegas, which is pretty often! We've tried numerous places close to home and have found nothing that comes even close to India Palace. We always leaving enjoying the food of other establishments since we love Indian food but it always feels like something is lacking. We always get the same items: 
Papadum served with various sauces -you get this for free right when you sit down 
Garlic naan 
Chicken tikka- it's all white meat with onions and peppers!! 
Chicken Vindaloo- extra \"Indian\" spicy 
Peas Pulao 
Simple, easy and DELISH! The place is clean and the service is warm and friendly without being overbearing."}
{"text":"Nothing great to say about this restaurant.. I felt okay with the food... Only thing I liked is, they serve water and lassi in bronze utensils.."}
{"text":"You know, I used to say that Indian food was my least fav cuisine.  It's not that I didn't like it, but it was just ok. The few times I have tried it, I have been overseas, but in other countries such as Germany or Italy. So I always wanted to go to an Indian Restaurant in the states (or in actual India, if you wanna take me) to judge for sure.  Well it's official, I love Indian food!  LOL! 


This place was great. Although there was a fabulous looking lunch buffet, we ordered off the menu since I had a Groupon that was for the menu only. 
 
The waiter was awesome...his name was Vick and he was super helpful and accommodating, especially knowing it was out first time. 

So we ended up ordering these fried vegetable appetizers that were very good, but I struggled whether to eat a second one knowing we had more food coming. I gave in and regretted it when the next course came, of course. LOL! 

We ordered the rack of lamb meal for $25. Both of us decided to split it since we weren't super hungry.  Glad we did, because it was more than enough for 2 people.  It came with a nice lentil soup that I didn't eat much of because I was getting so full. 

Then the lamb came and it was amazing.  They had a few sides of rice, potatoes and these veggies balls in the most amazing cream sauce.  The even put some fresh naan on the side that was too good!

Lastly, they served a mango desert. I was so full by this point, I wasn't really interested, but I took a bite just to let you know it was good.  

This is definitely a restaurant I will be back soon!!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food, but my husband had never had it. We chose India Palace because they had a Groupon. This place was awesome. We loved every bite. 

The appetizer combo was a great place to start. Lots of things to try and wonderful flavor. My husband had the Dal soup and it was great. He then ordered the Tandoori mixed grill which was equally delicious. 

I had garlic Nan bread which was to die for with my Chicken Tikka Marsala. Amazing!  I'm kind of a spice wimp, but it was the perfect amount of flavor. Make sure to order the rice with it. YUM!

We ate there for dinner, and the owner helped wait on us. Very friendly and helpful and he told us they have a daily lunch buffet from 11am to 3pm for 11.95. 

Overall, we enjoyed everything about India Palace."}
{"text":"We were originally planning to go next door, but the waiter talked us into giving this a try instead. We almost immediately wished we had chosen differently. 

First we were started off with a papadum that was more like a toasted soy cracker. I've actually had this kind of thing before and never liked it when it comes out like this, but at least usually you can hide it with some decent chutney. At Indian Palace we basically got slightly spicy ketchup. 

For the main course we got butter chicken, chana masala and okra. The okra was a bit on the slimy side and not particularly flavorful. I've had Chana Masala that is as good from a tasty bites package, and in fact that was what it most reminded me of. We also ordered roti, paratha. The paratha was good, but the roti was a bit on the tough side. We also had an ordeal with the rice. We were only going to order 1 but the waiter was push and convinced us that we needed two, which they billed us for. But we only got one plate of rice, and they billed us for two, including a pilou (which we didn't order or receive). There are only two possible reasons, either they overcharged us for something we didn't get or the rice portions are incredibly tiny. Either way it was a rip off. I didn't bother to talk to them about the rice though, I just took it out of their tip. Also the waiters were pushy, from beer, to the rice to the whole meal. It is what got us through the door, so I guess it worked, but it didn't create a good experience and none of us will be back."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, and so was the food. The spices were perfect in the lamb korma."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and excellent location. We ordered the dinner special.
It is a great deal. Get to taste a bunch of items. They have good beer selection too.
We got a mango lassi on the house!"}
{"text":"Best Restaurant experience in Vegas!

I had purchased a Living Social deal at the last minute.  We ended up going with a huge party.  I had a peach drink that was on fire.  Don't recall the name of it. It was delicous!  Our server was really great.  Made spot on suggestions cracked the occasional joke.

For a table of 5 we ordered rogan josh, sag paneer and two orders of chicken tikki masala, two orders of rice and two orders of garlic naan.  Everything was just delicious.  Not a negative thing to say about the entire meal.  

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! We had dinner here with our family of 7. The staff was friendly and helpful in every way. The food was outstanding and the prices reasonable. We can not wait to return for another fabulous meal."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's probably the best Indian lunch buffet we've tried since coming to Vegas. Everything was so flavorful! And they offers a lot of dishes that I'd never tried before - ones I've never seen offered at other buffets. 

It happened to be a Friday during Lent, so my hubby's stuck to the vegetarian dishes. I worried about this a little because his favorite Indian dishes usually involve chicken. But he couldn't have been more pleased! I think his favorite was the Saag Paneer and then Kheer for dessert, of course! My favorites were the Goat Curry and the Chicken Makhani. 

All of this was just under $30 including the tip. The service was fine and we had the place mostly to ourselves."}
{"text":"I dropped in here once for the buffet on a snowy Sunday afternoon.  It was quite quiet except for two or three tables, but the waiters were cordial and made sure we had everything we needed. 

For the herbivore, there are three or four dishes at the buffet.  The rice was satisfactory but one shouldn't complain considering how expensive grains have gotten in the past year.  The dal were great and left me quite satisfied.  For dessert, fruit is available.  The gulab jambu isn't too bad either although the syrup is a bit on the heavy side.

When it comes to buffets, expectations tend to drop, so this is nothing fancy.  I've not tried any of the other buffets on the strip, but I'd come back if I'm not feeling too fussy and just want a hearty meal for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I've been to India Palace a number of times now and would say it's one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Las Vegas. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but don't let that fool you. This place is worth it.

A few people I know used to not like this place because it was really dumpy. I never saw how it used to look, but the place was renovated a couple years ago and is quite nice now. Even the people who used to not like going there have returned. 

The menu items are typical of what you will find at most Indian restaurants, however, they have a number of Southern Indian foods that I was not familiar with. One dish, the dosa, is something I would highly recommend to anyone. Essentially, it is a gigantic crepe filled with ground potato and onion. To give you an idea of the size, it's probably about 20-24 inches long, 4 inches wide, and an inch thick. If you want to make it amazing, you can ask them to include ground lamb. It's not on the menu, but for an extra few bucks, it's overwhelmingly worth it. It comes with two sauces, sambar and coconut chutney. I've never cared much for coconut, but everyone else always thinks they go well together. Paired with their naan varieties, you really can't lose. 

The tandoori, masala, and everything else I've tried has been very good. Additionally, they have a lunch buffet for about $12 that's worth checking out. Overall, if you are looking for good Indian, this is somewhere you need to go."}
{"text":"Came here with family for dinner on a Sunday evening. Walking in, there was an overwhelmingly strong smell of desi spices, so the ventilation in the kitchen could be worked on. I've been to many Desi restaurants, and usually the strong curry smell is not an issue. If you've been here, you'll know what I'm talking about. 
The restaurant has nice decor but not well looked after. Booths are cramped. Cleanliness could be improved. Our appetizer plates were dirty. The waiter didn't seem to speak much english, and wasn't too knowledgeable about the menu. Waiting staff did not seem at all friendly, not particularly rude, but seemed like they hated their job- Not a single smile all evening. 
Food was mediocre at best. I got the chicken korma and wasn't pleased; the masala was too salty, and the chicken was stringy and almost translucent looking. Two stars are for the naan and the green chutney which were decent. 
Would've been nice if the waiters knew to actually ask if we wanted ice water or warm. All our glasses were filled with warm water. 
Overall, would not be returning, unless significant improvements are made."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and this is an Indian person saying that. Our server Manny was awesome, he really made our night."}
{"text":"We were lead to this place by the reviews, and we were also looking to try some authentic Indian food that didn't break the bank. Thankfully we found this place. 

To be honest we almost didn't dine here because it is located in a not really ideal place. It put my hubby on guard for a few moments (I guess his former military training was kicking in a bit) but he relaxed after more patrons arrived. It must be a popular place because not long after we arrived the restaurant filled up really quickly. Looks like they get a lot of take out too because people were just in and out of the restaurant. 

When sat down I told our server that it was our first time having Indian food. To which he replied \"oh you're gonna love it\" , love it we did.

My hubby, my friend Gary, and I all ordered the same thing which was the mixed curry dinner special. It gave us opportunity to have a sampling for different things. The special came with regular or garlic nan bread (we got garlic nan) basmati rice, lentil or chicken soup, chicken masala, shrimp masala, lamb Segway's, and mango custard to finish.  Thinking about it now, it's amazing how I was able to finish most of the food because it was a lot. For that much food at $26, that's a really great deal.

We were given some crispy bread to start with three different times of sauces-a chili sauce which had a lot of heat to it, a mint and yogurt chutney to cool you down from the chili sauce (my husband and I loved this one), and a sweet and sour tamarind sauce- which had just enough tamarind to balance out the sweetness of the sauce. We also added these to our entrees just to try different flavor profiles.

The soup came first. I had the lentil soup and it was amazing! All the flavors in it, oh man, I wish I had the recipe. Just a side note, I usually don't eat lentils but I will go back for the lentil soup. Hubby had the chicken soup and it reminded me of a Filipino soup my grandma used to make but with a lot more herbs and it had a freshness to it like cilantro perhaps? They brought out the garlic nan with our meal and man was our table crowded after that. Galic nan with the masala sauce, OMG heaven! You can order the Masala to the spice level that you want, but because I've never had masala, I ordered mild and asked if I could have extra for the spice that they put so I can adjust it as needed. They were nice to accommodate. The extra spice was a powder they put in a small sauce plate and the first thing I did was taste about a 1/4 spoonful of it. Wrong move, the heat from that extra spice hit fast, so learning my lesson I just put a pinch at a time in the masala until I got it to the desired spice level.

The dinner came with a mango custard. I had to try it before I finished eating my meal because I was afraid I wouldn't have enough room in my tummy. The custard was smooth and creamy, it had a bit of tapioca and I think it was coconut. Here I was feeling full and then I order a mango lassi. I was expecting a smoothie type drink but this was so smooth and thick I really couldn't finish it the it was so delicious. Everything was delicious! They asked if we wanted to take the leftovers (which wasn't a lot-couple slices of the garlic nan, the masala sauce) but told them we couldn't because we had to catch a flight in a several hours. And they were understanding.

Never once did we have to ask for our waters filled. Someone was always checking on us. Great food, great service. What more could you ask for. 

If we ever find ourselves back in Vegas we will stop by again maybe during lunch for their buffet."}
{"text":"Free garlic naan for checking in. Can't beat that! Place is nice and well spaced, clean and the service was good. Had the chicken vindaloo and the beef Byrini Both DELISH. Only downer was \"hot\" as in spicy, was not hot at all. Other than that, I'd DEF recommend!"}
{"text":"Traveling through and found this lovely restaurant. The food was delicious, the portions are very generous, and the staff was gracious. 

Everything about the restaurant is exactly what I love in an Indian restaurant - amazing aromas the minute I walk in, mellow lighting, decorations with classy flair, and of course Bollywood music videos playing in the background."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for the lunch buffet. The restaurant opens at 11. We arrived about 11:10. The buffet was limited in selection. The food was luke warm at best. The first plate of naan was not warm. When a second plate was brought out it was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Authentic, Delicious, Affordable Indian cuisine. Great appetizer selection. Had combination pakoras, garlic naan, lamb saag, and chicken saag. And let's not forget the basmati rice. Yum! Great service also.  Convenient from the Las Vegas Strip too."}
{"text":"Came here to eat lunch because we had a restaurant.com voucher we needed to use. And it was during the lunch buffet so we couldn't use the voucher. We checked in to get the mango lassi so my bf and I did and then they told us we could only use one per table but they ended up giving us the second one anyway. The masala wasn't spicy at all and the karahi was okay. We didn't even eat half of the karahi. We ordered medium spicy. The older lady was our server and we couldn't understand anything and she was rude as well. She didn't even crack a smile! The older man with glasses was nice. He was the one who gave us a free mango lassi and another on the go."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last weekend and was pleasantly surprised. The dollar to value was great!  The food was the best.
The customer service was friendly and attentive. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Indian dinner and a very good service gets this place 5 stars. Chicken tikka masala is truly a house special and aloo saag was superb. 
Really enjoyed the overall experience here and would love to come back when in Vegas. And ya special thanks to Gary for a very pleasant service."}
{"text":"We have been eating at India Palace for about 12 years. They have fantastic food and we haven't found any other Indian restaurant that even comes close. They are open every day and offer an excellent lunch buffet as well. The staff is always friendly. Try the Chicken Tikka and Paneer Masala along with some garlic Naan."}
{"text":"The waiters could be more courteous and not have an expression that made me feel like I've entered a funeral home.
Buffet items were bland and blah. Rotis were delicious. Nice ambience. 
My gripe with this place just like most Indian places is the lack of spice and flavor in they food, for some reason the dishes lack the character of their Indian counterparts. In India the same dish will be extremely flavorful. My first mistake I guess comparing with the taste back home. But what's the point in calling yourself fine Indian cuisine if you can't be authentic and recreate the exact flavors??
Also, my mom without knowing the \"rules of the land\" asked for pickles, the staff were extremely helpful and got her a cup full of it and later slipped me an extra $1.50, when asked why he goes oh, if it's not on the menu then you pay. OK!!! why can't you tell her that first, instead of slipping one in, not that I had a problem paying for it, he is right, but the lack of customer service or ethics just irked me.
Buffet is reasonably priced with enough items, improve customer service, remember it's the customer who makes or breaks your business. Improve flavor don't forget the roots of the dish. I know it is dumbed down to cater to local tastes but hey if I want to eat bland food I have lot of cheaper and healthier options."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The tikka masala is phenomenal... and my absolute favorite is the chicken Naan. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent with a capital X. I've been fairly content with all of the Indian food I've tried in Vegas. But somehow, India Palace managed to blow me away.

I came in here to finally use a long-standing Groupon with Kris J before he moved out of town. We ordered Saag Paneer, Navratan Korma, and Chicken Makhani. If you know me at all, you know that I love my Butter Chicken! IP's Makhani failed to disappoint. It was creamy, tender, and oh so delicious. I'm so enamored by Butter Chicken, I feel like I basically ignore every other dish that the culture has to offer. I'm glad I had such an IP connoisseur with me. The Paneer and Korma--both Kris's selections--were outstanding! I'm not quite sure what it is, but there's something about IP's food that just ever-so-slightly sets them apart from the crowd.

The one weird thing about the visit? It seemed like we had five different servers waiting on us and they all lined up behind the scenes to take their turn to come over and ask if we had everything we needed. It's not a bad thing. It was just comical.

I wish I had bought more Groupons now."}
{"text":"We happened to be on chrismas day there and buffet was 20$ for a very small selection. Somehow we heard it as $9.95( it looked like that), but when the bill came, it was 86$ for 2 adults and 2 kids. Most expensive indian buffet I ever had. To me it was not worth it. To order all items are very pricey. I will not visit again."}
{"text":"Wow! Found my new favorite Indian joint! The food here is amazing. I had dinner and ordered the Korma Chicken and lets just say I'm hooked. The flavor and texture of the dish was something I've never had before and I've been eating Indian food for a while. The atmosphere is great & open. Nice well stocked bar & Bollywood playing on several flat screens. I believe the  owner is the bartender & a Russell Peters look-a-like. LOL The night I came there was a bus load of Indian tourists but the restaurant was well planned in advance. Prior to their arrival I would say there was a fairly large amount of Indian locals so you know the food is good. The free mango lassi was a great compliment to our meal. Garry our server is awesome and attentive. He's been there for 7 years so be sure to ask for him to get the best service. All in all this place gets 5 stars and despite the area it was still a safe place to park and not worry about the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Best. Indian food. Ever. We ordered chicken tikka masala, tomato soup, and a ton of garlic naan. AMAZING. First of all, nothing we order from Postmates or UberEats ever arrives even remotely warm. Everything was piping hot and Delicious. So much flavor, huge portions, I cannot rave about this place enough! Our new go-to dinner spot!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time my husband Duncan and I ate here.  It was even better than the first time.  We had a great deal off of Groupon that included 2 entrees, 2 glasses of wine and rice.  We ordered an appetizer that i cant remember the name of but had a really good cold yogurt sauce, and almost tasted like dessert.  We ordered The Okra and chicken curry both Extra extra spicy. I said I wanted to breathe fire, lol.  It was perfect!  The dinner actually got spicier as we ate.  We also had leftovers to take home.  Thank you we will be back.  And as a side note especially if you use \"groupon\" people, be sure to tip generously!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously so good. We come for the wine and stay for the gnocchi! Some of the Albert I've ever had. 

Also liked the bread"}
{"text":"We've been here more than once. Amazing authentic Indian food,love paneer masala dish! Also everyone is so friendly here"}
{"text":"It was our first time at India Palace and it was a terrific experience. Vick was a great server with recommendations and very attentive.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Rather dark inside, definitely unassuming from the outside. A bit skeptical to  give it a shot after cruising through the neighborhood but pleasantly surprised that I did. An earlier reviewer was right. \"You can't go wrong here.\" As spicy as you like (I like) with tastefully exotic ambience. Well worth the cab fare from the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Solid Indian buffet at lunch with most northern Indian dishes. Nothing too spicy with a good combo of rice and curries. Friendly service and free naan bread with each order. I suggest getting the garlic naan, buttery and delish."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the food here. The service is friendly and efficient They would have five stars if the neighborhood wasn't so seedy that you were concerned about being there!
We have done both the dinner menu and lunch buffet. Flavors are always spot on and freshly made."}
{"text":"Awful...The restaurant was  completely empty. They sat us, gave us a menu, waited 15 minutes and the waiter returned and stated  we could not order off the menu due to a catering event they had for 700. Offered us a buffet option which we declined and departed. So we went to Satay on Paradise. Much better!!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner .. not even a single person was there in the restaurant. No cars in the parking lot. Still went ahead and ordered food. Masala dosa-Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Since our last visit approximately 3 years ago, the restaurant has undergone a complete makeover so the dining room is quite nice though the immediate area surrounding the restaurant remains depressed.  We did not require our reservation as the dining room was empty.  Shortly after being seated we were served complimentary papadum and 3 chutney/sauces.  We decided to share orders of garlic naan, chicken tika masala, basmati rice and lamb sagwala.  The flavor and spice level of each dish proved to be too tame for my taste buds."}
{"text":"Coming from the bay area where we seem to have an infinite supply of Indian buffets I can only give this place 3 stars because it wasn't bad but there are some things I did not like:

- The naan was too thin and they have mostly garlic naan.  I asked for plain and they said ok, but they brought out the garlic naan again.

- The selection isn't that great and they don't put out that much food.  I only got two pieces of Tandoori chicken which I had to dig out from the rest of the stuff.

- Also, the spices seems a bit lacking.  Not only am I used to food being a bit more spicy, but just flavor in general seemed to be lacking.  And some of the potatoes dishes the potatoes were undercooked (hard).

After reading all the reviews, I guess I expected a lot more.  I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"India Palace never disappoints! Chicken tikka masala is amazing and the bhindi masala is delicious! We always get garlic naan with our meal and make sure to order extra to take home. My husband and I try to come here as often as we can!"}
{"text":"This restaurant, which is in an unattractive, sketchy part of town, has a \"cheap\" feel to it.  We were seated towards the front of the restaurant and found the seating and table to be average to low quality and we were close to other patrons.  The ambiance was not good.  The silverware and plates were average to low quality.  The food and service were unremarkable and forgettable (and we are avid fans of Indian food)."}
{"text":"I took my nephew and sister out for Indian at Indian Palace. The food was excellent! I could taste the love it was made with. Not only that but it was made with fresh ingredients, and they don't charge for garlic naan. It is all you could eat for only $9.99. They didn't even charge for my nephew who is 6 for a small plate. They are not here to rip you off; rather they are genuinely in the hospitality business.  We've been here several times and we will continue to come back. Definitely recommend coming here if you like Indian."}
{"text":"Food was extremely good and the hostess was quite friendly.  She even gave me a rice pudding to try for free with my takeout order.  Will definitely be back as the food was delicious.  I had the chicken tiki masala and was initially annoyed that the rice is sold ala carte, however the portion size was quite generous so I definitely have enough for dinner tonight or lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Hungry at lunchtime? India Palace has a great Indian buffet for around $10 pending on your beverage.  Since it's a buffet, you can enjoy eating rather than waiting to be served.  Staff has always been friendly.  Besides the buffet, you do get a basket full of Naan bread.  It's a huge restaurant so bring your all your hungry co-workers!  Tandoori chicken is spicy and tender.  I do like the potato and cabbage dish, rice and the spinach saag.  Some of the reviews say it's not totally authentic, well it pleases my palate therefore I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice meal in there on 5/10. Bengan bartha was tasty and the only poor part of the meal were the nan breads, they were not at all fresh. Good prices though and good service and Fullers ESB to boot!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service by our FAVE SERVER Garry...1000% Outstanding!!!!!! Great job.....Thank you...."}
{"text":"I love Indian food my husband an I try different places on our date night, the India Palace is one of our favorites! Our server Vick was awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Ordered chicken korma (I ordered medium spice level) & chicken tikka masala (husband ordered spicy). Perfect spice level. Garlic naan yummy. Friendly & fast service. Easy & convenient to use my groupon purchased on my phone through yelp. We will be back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had family in town and wanted Indian food. Took them there. 
Service was very slow 
Kept on asking for mild and gave me hot.
Food didn't taste good, too much spices, Bitter tasting compare to Indian food I've had before. 
Place is cold, didn't turn the heater.  Won't go back there again. Don't recommend it"}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite Indian Restaurant in the valley. Super clean and welcoming plus the staff is very nice. I went for the lunch buffet and it was absolutely delicious. The options include vegetarian and meat dishes that are well prepared."}
{"text":"I was looking for Indian food in Phoenix for the first time (my favorite place is out of state) and was craving chicken tiki masala. The place is pretty and service was fast for naan and drinks. The buffet was small and very limited, some of the food was out which was a bummer. It also tasted like it had been sitting out for hours, but I should have expected for such a small buffet. The chicken tiki masala did not meet my expectations, I wish the chicken tasted fresher and had more flavor. The garlic naan was good."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have found in Phoenix hands down. Food is flavorful and authentic, and the staff are always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Good food and service.
Malai kofta was best.
Baingan bharta was not so good.
FYI the place is off the main vegas blvd so please plan accordingly."}
{"text":"We walked in and for the first six minutes were greeted with complete disregard and blank stares from the staff, granted they were busy but a simple hello or a welcome wouldn't have hurt anyone. We've been here plenty of times before but treated very rudely this time. No matter how busy you get a guest should never have to feel that. It was just plain disrespectful."}
{"text":"I've now tried this place twice, hopeful the second time would be more exciting than the first. It was not. Speaking solely on food quality...its kind of meh. I ordered a total of three separate dishes over two trips. Saag Chicken, Butter Chicken, and Chicken Tikka Masala. The Butter chicken is slightly sweeter than most butter chicken dishes, reminiscent of the flavor of spaghetti-O's in the can. The Saag Chicken is overly spicy I found, and tasted better cold (left overs). The Chicken Tikka Masala, was I found also slightly spicy and it separated weirdly, like the grease and the red stuff. 

In terms of sides, the peas pillau (rice) was tasty. The Naan, both garlic and plain were too thick. Like 3/4\" thick in certain places, so it was undercooked in the middle of the thick portions. 

I'd try other places before recommending this one."}
{"text":"We have lived in the valley for over two decades and just ran across this place. We decided to stop and grab something to go on our way home. When we walked in the atmosphere was so comfortable and inviting that we decided to stay. We both ordered the chicken curry, and the very nice waitress (owner? This place is clearly family owned) recommended either the Chicken Korma or the Chicken Tikka Masala. We decided to get one of each and share. They were both incredibly good. Service was very good, restaurant was clean and all of the staff was friendly. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service , food smells terrible , tables are terribly dirty. Never again."}
{"text":"Service deserves 4 stars. The food deserves 3 stars. Price deserves 4 stars. I would go back to this place if I was in the area, but other than that, I can't really say if I would travel that far to this India Palace. Food was decent, but not as flavorful as I would like it. It's not bad for $9"}
{"text":"I eat at India Palace AT LEAST once per week. Their LUNCH BUFFET has amazing variety, diverse options, and is competitively priced among the other Indian buffets in town! Seriously, an inexpensive buffet with top quality food -- it's practically unheard of in Vegas.

Whether you want a relaxing and quick lunch with friends and family, or an impressive dinner with clients or colleagues, India Palace is one of the absolute best food options in town. 

Now let's talk about the food...
Ingredients = Exceptional Quality
Taste = Exquisite Flavor
Presentation = Elegantly Authentic

I have tried every Indian restaurant in Las Vegas, and this is the best in town! Not only is the atmosphere highly pleasant, the employees are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and LOVED it! It is very clean and authentic. We were quickly served and our waitress was really nice. We started off with the fritters (came variety of dipping sauces) mango chutney, sweet tamarind, and two others that were also really good. Also had the garlic naan -yum!!! For main course I had the medium spiced chicken vindaloo. The only downside is that you have to purchase rice separately (thought the dish comes with automatically) but other than that it was delicious! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"It's taken too long for me to leave my review but I swore I would come back and leave my two cents because this place was that good. I went on a Sunday night and it was great. A fair amount of people for a Sunday evening and the serving staff was great. They made my fiancé and I feel welcome and the food was delicious. We got garlic nan (of course), rice, chicken tikka masala, and Lamb korma and each dish was as fantastic as the next. We went conservative on the spiciness and it was even less spicy than I'd expect. If you are wavering on if a spiciness is in your comfort zone or not, it probably is.

We even took some leftovers back for my brother who swore up and down that he didn't like Indian food and when he was finished scooping up the masala sauce all he had to say was 'when is the buffet open?'

Next stop, lunch buffet! Enjoy."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Indian food and this place did not disappoint! We had Vegetable pakora, chicken tikka masala, malai kofta, tandoori chicken and garlic naan and it was all fantastic. No complaints. Another reviewer mentioned it's not in a great area of town and I'd agree but it was worth going."}
{"text":"Wonderful food,  especially for anyone familiar with northern Indian cuisine.  Chili chicken is very unique.  Lamb Vindloo outstanding.  Love the garlic naan.  A Kingfisher beer a great plus.  Very helpful and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is always great.  I've never had a bad experience here.  The staff is very efficient and friendly.  

The food is awesome!  Try the garlic naan, vegetable pakoras, vegetable korma and chicken tikka masala.  

I highly recommend this restaurant.  You won't be disappointed.   Very authentic indian food."}
{"text":"I went in to Indian Palace last week while visiting Las Vegas and went to this place all 3 days either for lunch or dinner . The food was very authentic , service was great. Highly recommend this place for folks who like traditional Indian ( Punjabi) food."}
{"text":"Wow! The renovation has really improved the ambiance of this place! Great job... so much more open, with a lot more space. Some good Bollywood videos on the TV, low lighting.  Nice.  

Anyway! The lunch buffet ($11.95) has several vegan options, one of which is MASALA DOSA! I know! You're freaking out.  You have been looking for an Indian place that even SERVES dosa, much less has it on the buffet!!  Well, this is a blessing and a curse.  Masala dosa should be eaten immediately after it comes off the griddle, which does not happen at a buffet.  BUT if you can hold out til you see a fresh batch brought out, it's pretty good.  And the sambar to go with was super tasty.  (Bad news though, their coconut chutney has dairy in it.)

The server was very helpful pointing out the vegan-friendly dishes (pakora, rice, chana masala, cabbage, dosa, sambar, some salad stuff).  They will also bring you (vegan) roti upon request instead of naan.

It's an A-OK place; a nice change of pace from the usual trip across the street to Mint.

Oh, and meat-eaters - apparently you MUST try the meatballs and the goat.  That was the word around the table, can't confirm personally!"}
{"text":"This is a go to place for my girlfriend and I it's almost like our little secret spot the owner is super helpful in letting us know what we should order based on what we like this is a family run business and I'm proud to support it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant. My husband and I eat there so many times! The food is amazing!!! The atmosphere quiet and pleasant. The owners are really nice! I would eat here everyday if i could!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch with co-workers now, and both times have deeply enjoyed myself and had to waddle out.

First thing's first. When you go, order the Garlic Naan. It's wonderful hot crispy-fluffy naan, slathered with minced garlic and herbs, and I could probably just eat that and the curry sauce by the bucketful. It's not an additional price on top of the buffet, which is what takes India Palace from 3-4 stars for me. So garlicky and wonderful.

The buffet itself is pretty typical Indian-for-mostly-americans fare; I had the Aloo Gobi, Butter Chicken, a few curries, Goat Curry, and Bahji, which were all good, and I had no real complaints. Some of the chunks of chicken were those hard fatty bits, and a little bit unpleasant, but those are pretty expected in stews/curries/etc and overall, everything was great. The saag paneer stuck out as particularly delicious.

They were great about honoring the free mango lassi yelp check-in deal, and, since it was my first time trying lassi (I haven't tried one before because I'm not usually a yogurt fan, and I haven't wanted to spend 3-6$ on a drink I will probably not like, but hey, free is the right price to try new things).  So I tried a new thing and really enjoyed it. I can't say if it was good or bad in lassi terms as I have nothing to compare it to, but I CAN say I plan on trying more lassi's now so that I can find out. And I think that's a pretty good sign for it's tastiness. 

I will definitely be back for the lunch buffet, but I think I will need to try some of the other indian places around town before I choose my \"go-to\" dinner joint. The a-la-carte menu seems a little pricey around dinner time here, but the lunch buffet price is perfect for me."}
{"text":"With a coupon from Restaurant.com, $25 off $50 makes dinner here affordable for us every few months.  For four people, we order the Mixed Curry Dinner ($26) and Vegetarian Dinner ($20) plus an appetizer if we're still hungry.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is my favorite by far, and the mango pudding is a great dessert.  I love the mint chutney, but sometimes it's a little too salty.  The service is always pleasant, but often too attentive with five different waiters checking on us.  I didn't know they offer a lunch buffet, so I plan on checking it out soon!"}
{"text":"The $9.99 lunch buffet is wonderful. Plenty to choose from and you walk out very full and satisfied. The tandoori chicken is my favorite. The daal ,spinach and masala are sooo good too. The different flavors make your mouth melt. I highly recommend this place. You can't go wrong"}
{"text":"It's probably not fair for me to review this because I'm really not a big fan of Indian food so it's probably better than what I'm giving them credit for. Oh well.

My friend and I came here for their lunch buffet. We were seated immediately by a nice lady. And then we went to do some damage. I don't know the names of the dishes but I really liked the mushroom masala and them tandoori chicken. They also had a spinach dish that wasn't too bad. As for the rest, it was eh. The food was spicy but not to where you can't eat it. I have been to some Indian restaurants where I wasn't able to eat because of how spicy it was. The bread, naan, was freaking amazing! i was eating it alone. thats one of the main reasons i would go back here Anyway, the desserts were limited. There was rose pudding which was a little too thick, some other type of pudding which I called feet pudding because that's what it tasted like. And there was the gulab jaman which is this round ball of cake that's soaked in gods pee because that's how sweet it is. I felt myself becoming a diabetic immediately after eating it. 

Prices were cheap. Service was ok. I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing service and they do not hold on to what they say. We asked the server about corkerage we were told that since you guys come regularly we will not charge you we still wanted to know the charges and we were informed its $15. Now while we ordered food they did not serve entire order which and rest of the food comes after we finished dinner and when its time to pay they charged us $25 corkerage when we asked the owner about it he said thats what we charge. There is no coordination between the management and staff or else its a policy to misguide customers. They are not open to suggestions. Never going back to this place and I strongly recommend my friends try other places they are much better than this one."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend today and loved it! The food was delicious, especially the chicken marsala. Great service by both the waiter(who was friendly and fast)and the kitchen staff that brought the food out. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"All the dishes were really good the only reason I don't give it five stars, is because our food took about 20 minutes to come out.But I would definately come back!"}
{"text":"I had been craving Indian food for a while now so I forced my man to come with me.. Unfortunately, he is not a huge fan of Indian cuisine..We got here at 8:30 on a Sunday night and there was just 1 other table besides us.. This place is located in a pretty sketchy neighborhood but once inside it's not that bad... 

We ordered: 
-The Tandoori Chicken Dinner Special: Tandoori chicken, Saag Paneer, Mixed Vegetables ($25.95)
-The Mixed Curry Dinner Special: Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Sagwala, Chicken Masala ($25.95) 
-Dinner specials also come with dal soup (traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils) and choice of bread.. We got garlic naan & roti.. 
-They also give you complimentary pappadum & chutneys 
-Mango Lassi (free with check-in but they only let us have 1 to share lol) .. Tasted like a sour mango yogurt milkshake LOL

The food was just OK.. My favorite item was the chicken tikka masala~ The service absolutely SUCKED... Even though there were 7 servers just sitting around no one even came to refill our water glasses or check up on us even once.. Anyways after we left I started feeling sick and when we arrived home I most definitely was sick... EWWW I got food poisoning from there and spent the next day feeling absolutely miserable.. The total bill was over $50 and the food quality was the same.. if not worse than a standard lunch buffet.. Thank the Lord I had a Restaurant.com certificate so we only paid a little over $37... But it was not worth getting sick for. I will stick to Mount Everest or try Mint next time. Blehhhhhhhh~

HOT TIP: Indian lunch buffets are absolutely the way to go~!!!"}
{"text":"Although they are located in the hood, this restaurant is by far one of the best Indian food joints Ive had since living in Vegas.  The food is seasoned to perfection. The service is great.  Def a must try"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Phoenix. Originating from England, I have experienced a LOT of Indian food and am a fan. India Palace makes some great dishes, LOVE their Bombay Aloo, staff and friendly, atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Indian restaurants I have even been to... certainly the best in Las Vegas.
The food was delicious. Very friendly hosts and nice ambiance. Price was just right too.
Glad we found this Gem.... highly recommended."}
{"text":"When is the best time to go here? Lunch time! I absolutely love the luncheon buffet. It's such a great deal - $8.95 per person, all you can eat. Like with any other buffet, you have to finish your food there. You can't box up your leftovers and take them home. It's perfect for lunch with a big group. There are a lot of big tables that can accommodate a large party size. The place starts getting pretty full around noon. 

It's such a relief that there is a nice balance between meat and vegetarian dishes. I can bring my vegan friends without worrying that they will starve. They usually have three vegetarian curries and 2 meat curries along with various desserts. The tandoori chicken was very tender and flavorful. The ground lamb curry was delicious and didn't taste gamey at all. Remember to ask for the garlic naan. I love dipping the naan with my curry. I highly recommend trying the white rice pudding, one of my favorites. There are also warm chai tea available that is wonderful for chilly days around this time of year. 

Service was friendly and efficient. The servers promptly removed our dirty plates and continuously refilled our waters. When it came to checking out, they were very chill about splitting up the bill for each individual."}
{"text":"Chicken Tiki Masala was one of the many delicious dishes we enjoyed!  This place is wonderful from top to bottom!!! The spices and naan are amazing, I would recommend to anyone looking for a yummy bite"}
{"text":"I bought daal makhni and rice but daal was burnt. It had a burning smell and burning taste. Had to throw it out."}
{"text":"If you love authentic Indian food at a great price, this is the place to go!  And when you see other Indian families eating it's an even better sign!  Thank you for the amazing food as usual!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food (and we have only made it in for the buffet). And the service is spectacular!!"}
{"text":"By far the best indian buffet in Toronto. A solid 4 as far as Indians buffets are concerned, but a 3 for their made to order food. 3.5 overall.

I usually go there for the buffet, which is far superior to the generic stuff dished out by Little India and somewhat better than Trimurti's. Went there as recently as two days ago, with some friends visiting from India who oohed and aahed about the quality of the buffet spread: the gooey samosa filling, the succulent lamb kebabs, the tender okra, and the divine rice pudding (their dessert is always on the mark and without the accompanying artificial sweetness).

The service is friendly and attentive: the owner has chatted us up every time since the very first time we went. The restaurant's a bit on the cozy side and the decoration nothing fancy. I've always enjoyed my meals here and I am not going anywhere else on Queen St. for Indian food."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have a habit of ordering the same thing because its so good. We order the Lamb Korma. Its tender an flavorful. Then the bread called garlic naan. It has lots of fresh herbs on top. Its close to pita bread but much better. I come here a few times a month and its always a hit."}
{"text":"The food was good, The tables were nice. No better or worse than other Indian places I suppose. The guy with the paint-brush mustache was fun to look at. The server with the shaved head I felt got a little too familiar with us but it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"It was the surprisingly pleasant facade that brought us to India Palace on a Sunday evening.  As we drove through the parking lot, we were stunned to see how busy it was.  The private lot was packed and we took the last parking space.  (There were still cars coming in as we walked into the restaurant.)  Could there be private event?

As I took a quick peek in, it didn't seem like it was closed for a party.  We took the last of the two tables available, which was our luck since the rest of our dinner there was a large group of people waiting.  Checking out our fellow diners, and we were surrounded by Indians and non-Indians.  This place was was ridiculously busy!  As a result, it took awhile to get our orders in and for our food to come.  It looked like a new restaurant inside with the simple decorations and complementing paint choices.  (As other yelper mentioned, they just renovated.)  A lone TV behind the bar showed Bollywood videos throughout the meal.  They also have two smaller rooms off to the sides.

The Husband and I both ordered a Mango Lassi \"Sweet yogurt based shake made with mango pulp.\" ($3.95) to start and it was probably one of the best I've had.  Presented in a copper cup, I would say they give you more than other places do.

We both chose a dinner special, which comes with chicken or dal soup; choice of bread - plain naan, garlic naan, or roti; basmatic rice and mango custard.

The Dal Soup \"A traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils.\" was simple, but tasty.  A nice start to our meal.

The Garlic Naan was a generous amount, and we actually had leftovers.  It was tasty with lots of garlic.

My Vegetable Dinner Special included \"Saag Paneer, Navratan Korma, Dal Makhani, Raita\" ($19.95).  The Saag Paneer \"Creamy spicy spinach with chunks of homemade cheese.\" is usually a favorite of The Husband's, so I let him have most of it.  It was good, but not my favorite. The Navratan Korma \"Mixed veggies with cheese in a creamy sauce with cashews, almonds & raisins.\" was a favorite though, probably because I love creamy sauces in Indian cooking. The Dal Makhani \"Lentil delicacy flavored with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic & cream.\" was also very good as well, because I love lentils and cream!  The Raita \"Yogurt seasoned with cumin, cucumber, tomatoes & mint.\" has never been something I could enjoy, so The Husband enjoyed most of it.

The Husband went for the Rack of Lamb Dinner Special \"Rack of Lamb, Malai Kofta, Aloo Matar\" ($25.95).  The Malai Kofta \"Cheese & vegetable balls in an aromatic gravy.\" was a bit interesting, as we would say.  It's considered a \"House Favorite\" but it was just a bit weird for us.  The Aloo Matar \"Green peas cooked with diced potatoes and aromatic spices in a curry sauce.\" was yummy, as most Indian curry dishes are.  The rack of lamb was also good, and loaded with tons of onions and bell peppers, which The Husband ate up.

The Mango Custard was a light simple liquid custard drink with chunks of fruit in it.  Not exactly what I call a custard, but more like a thicker lassi.

Service was okay - when our waiter finally took our order, the food took awhile and our bill took awhile too.  The women serving the food could use a little brush up on how to clear a table.  Simple things like clearing the soup bowls before bringing out the other food might help a bit.  We were seated at a small table, so it was crowded with all our mini dishes.

Overall, India Palace served up some good Indian food.  In general, I love the intense spices used in Indian cooking, and you definitely get it here.  I can't say how authentic it is, but from the many Indians eating there, I take that as a good sign.  It is a bit pricey though compared to other Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian places here in town. Love the Chicken Tikka Masala and Navratan Korma...and the garlic naan. Top it off with a mango lassi and is the perfect Indian meal. Lunch buffet is pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"I am from Atlanta which is filled with Indian restaurants, but I never go and eat there as they suck.
I visit Vegas very often. And I try to eat at this place at least once when I am there.
Everything they make is just too good...I love their samosas/ kabobs/naans..rather everything. They make everything just the way you want it to be.
Yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"First off the staff is AMAZING! They remember you and treat you like family! Service is always fast and on point. The bathroom is always clean and so is the restaurant. My drinks and water are fast and they pride themselves on that.

The food!!! Let's get to that. The buffet is every day 7 days a week from 11am- 230 pm and it is tasty! They rotate so many amazing foods and flavors it's insane great! Many different proteins and veggies always in rotation and lamb is ALWAYS on the menu. The deserts and veggie bar is wonderful as well. They also have the BEST Milk Tea in town. 

They have a full bar and dinner service as well that is fantastic! I also want to mention that I have a service dog for PTSD and they are very welcoming and respectful. This business is family owned and operated- they make you feel like a family member and not just a guest. If you love Indian cuisine and you live in Phoenix this place is a MUST!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very kind staff and very attentive. Their menu has many delicious dishes to choose from, but I chose the classic chicken tikka masala. The chicken was moist and the sauce had great flavor. I always ask for very spicy and they definitely delivered. It was the tasty spicy that I wanted and not overbearing. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tremendous food and atmosphere.  Sat next to a couple from Southern India and they said it was some of the best they have tasted in the states. Ordered the house favorite, Tikka Masala.  Try the non as well."}
{"text":"Was delicious! The service started out slow but the waiter we got was so cool and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and even more amazing food. Have been here over 10 times in the past year I've lived here and I plan to continue! I highly highly recommend trying place"}
{"text":"This place is not located at the best place in town but the restaurant itself looks pretty decent. I came for their lunch buffet and found that they didn't have as many options as other restaurants. Staples like chicken curry, chicken tikka masala and paneer tikka Masala, tandoori chicken are there. The chicken curry was really salty but the rest of the food was good. 

I've been to better ones with more options and the food wasn't as salty. Also, being under the heat lamp for so long made the food look a little dry and old. 

Their garlic naan is delicious though!"}
{"text":"i have read the review that lamb curry is good and went for it..I went for pick up for a lamb curry and dal.I felt very bad after picking this to home.. i thought it was curry ,but with piece of  mutton with just  little curry .I think they just dumped all the leftovers as i was the last customer there. The curry was not good at all. Even the dal was not tasting good . I would never repeat here."}
{"text":"Bad place ... The guy don't want to write the orders he said he has good memory ,  next all our order was totally wrong ... Fun part the person was not even apologetic ... Please don't go to these place"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner at 6pm. Got crowded at about 8pm. Full house.  

Building was nice on the outside, but did not expect the dumpy location around it. Thinking Diamond in the rough? Not quite. 

Service was good until it got busy then it was Ok. I had to go up to the bar to cash the check cause I didn't see waiter for a while.  

Food was neutral.  Not really bad but not great. Garlic Naan was really the best thing.  I was expecting more flavors but it was ok. They got my order wrong (chicken instead of shrimp) & shrimp came out rubbery (they take tail off). Small shrimp. Chicken tica tamdoori was good but they brought that out like it was an appetizer?  It was my husband's main entrée. I'm not sure what happened with that,  but we weren't going to complain in front of friends. Plus the onions & such were not cooked all the way. I don't eat raw onions (they barely cooked them). 

Small portions for price.  

Don't know we would go back unless friends  absolutely wanted to go there.  Too bad because I thought we found the best Indian place in town :("}
{"text":"Excellent food the flavors, the environment and the service. My server Garry came to check on me several times and took great care of me 5start experience!"}
{"text":"It was a very hectic time of the year, i was packing, my room was a mess, uncertainty on my employment, and i am about to transfer to San Francisco. 

It was another bored afternoon after an early day at work. I was driving around hunting for food and i realized this little hidden treasure within a small strip mall. The strip mall looks kinda run-down a bit, but once you enter the premise, you are greeted by a delicate aroma of curry and spiciness in the air.

So i decided to patron this restaurant for a heavy buffet lunch. I wasn't expecting much especially there ain't much good Indian cuisine here in Arizona. I went to the buffet lane.. :P and the first item was 2 choice of rice... Regular basmati rice or bryani rice, which is very rare that they offer 2 type of rice for buffet. Next there are plenty of choices of daal and vegetable curry. The cauliflower and potato masala was great. Then the typical serving of chicken tandoori and chicken masala. To my delight, they actually serve lamb curry which is very rare for Indian lunch buffet.

The flavor was decent for a buffet lunch, but it seems like a great deal for a lunch they serve. As usual, i stuffed myself with 2 full plates of masala and rice, then end with a plate of lamb curry and chicken masala with the naan that they served with the lunch.

Too bad that i have just relocated myself to the Bay Area about 4 days ago... if not i will surely return to the restaurant to fulfill my craving for Indian serving and masala."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever. I LIVE DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET and they made me come down from my high rise. They forgot like half my order and totally jipped me and my friends by giving us no rice with two of our curries! how rude. The food was cold and bland. They gave us one slab of naan for 5 people and we used to order from them all the time and they couldn't find my house?! I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET"}
{"text":"Food is tasty; however, food establishment REFUSED to honor purchased coupon from Living Social.  DO NOT spend your hard-earned money at India Palace."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great servive. Full flavor without over seasoning. They have a good Groupon deal. Price is a bit deep, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"The BF and I have been trying all the Indian lunch buffets about town. 

The buffet was overall decent. The spread was fairly good with Navarathan Korma being the definite star. It was creamy and flavorful with crunchy veggies. A close second was the chicken makhani as the chicken was moist. Some of the other offerings were good, but other than what I mentioned, pretty standard.  

The service is really friendly and very attentive so major points for that. Didn't need to ask for refills and plates were cleared right away. We were checked on often.

I think I prefer this over the other much talked about Namaste, but it cannot beat Mint for me."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, great Phoenix restaurant. I have ordered take out several times now from here, and every time I go, I'm greeted with great customer experience and am rewarded with some fantastic flavors. Must Visit!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food and begged my friends to go try this place out with me! The location looks small, but it's actually really roomy when you get inside. The parking lot was really tiny though, but it wasn't crazy crowded so it wasn't too much of an issue. 

With the food, I was really delightfully surprised by this $12 dollar Indian buffet. It was excellent. Some of the food was not as warm as I thought it would be, which was sort of a turn off for me. It probably would have tasted better if it were warmer! I did enjoy the Saag Paneer as well as any dishes that had chicken in it :) 

Our experience with service was good! Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, although he was a bit slow with the check and water. 

Honestly, I would go again. I'm going to get food made-to-order, so it's hot, but I am definitely willing to come back!!! Don't pass this place over and don't forget to use that check-in deal!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in a long time! The chicken korma is fabulous. You can tell that they put a lot of work into perfecting the flavors and seasoning. Fast, friendly service as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tips:

Ask for garlic naan!

$8 for lunch buffet. Super cheap!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lunch buffet is pretty limited to about 3 curries and a bunch of sides, but overall I think everything tasted very good and very filling. The curry was a bit more liquid-y than I expected, but that didn't take away from the taste.

The naan is brought fresh to your table and you can even order garlic naan!

Overall it's a very good place for some cheap indian food to curb your cravings!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food out there. We had dinner before it got real busy which was o.k. With me. 
Try the Hayward imported Indian beer. The food was great and the service wasn't bad. Not the greatest part of town but oh well. Glad we went :-)"}
{"text":"We had food twice here:
1. Dinner
Each item was super tasty. We had chicken kadhai, lamb curry, fish tikka, chana masala and panir tikka. 

We also had kulcha and nan - both were good. If you are from Bengal or South Indian - you won't like the biriyani. 

One more warning: the service is little shaky and generally they take a bit longer than usual. 

2. Lunch Buffet:

The buffet over all was good. 

But we liked dinner way more than the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Zagat rated pretty much indicates that a restaurant is quite excellent. And they're correct with this place. Best Indian food in Vegas so far. The only place that I know of that knocks this place out of the map would be Curry In A Hurry back in NY. But. This place will do. Unless I visit NY again! Go for buffet during lunch. Great price and selection."}
{"text":"Just amazing. Best in town. I've been going there since they opened in 1999  and every time I am in town and they have stayed superb....lamb korma to die for with lots of flavor and the right amount of spices. Naan bread...perfection.....lassi, kulfi, samosas all just wow. Don't go anywhere else? And for what it's worth I'm a traveler and an amazing cook myself so I know my stuff. Trust me. Don't go elsewhere. This place is incredible."}
{"text":"Spicy tasty food and decent service. Malai kofta was amazing. It's a bit pricy though!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years I have not found better Indian food in the city.  It's always been consistently good and I have to recommend Lamb korma.  They make it with cashews raisins and lots of cream and just a hint of spice which is exactly how I like it.  The garlic naan and plain naan are both amazing, please do try the vegetable samosas as they are far superior to the meat ones. The atmosphere is really nice too and they did go through a major renovation some years back which was well worth it.  It's not in the best neighborhood but believe me when I say make it over there as you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Enjoyed service and most of the items on buffet.  Dosas and left more to be desired."}
{"text":"This fabulous restaurant is tucked into a corner of a shopping center just off of Bell Road.  Once inside, the decor is inspiring and the waitstaff personable.  The food, from appetizer to dessert, exquisite!  The spices in each dish were well balanced and unique.  While enjoying dinner, plans were already being made to share this place with others.  It is just too good to keep to yourself."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been driving all the way from Litchfield Park and West Peoria for several years going to this restaurant.  We have never had a bad experience and we are absolutely in love with their weekend buffet.  The naan is fantastic and my personal favorite dish is the Palak Aloo.  Who knew spinach could be so good??"}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's honestly one of the best I have eaten in USA so far. I loved their seekh kebab as it reminded me of Delhi. Born and brought up in Delhi I know what a seekh should taste like, I have tasted some of the best kebabs in old Delhi and New Delhi and this definitely brought back those memories in a good way. The owner is a good host and very hospitable. I would recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"Come here for Indian buffet. Food is flavorful. Somewhat cold.... So I recommend stirring the food a bit before putting it on your plate. About twelve different items. Very common dishes you see at most Indian buffets. Half vegetarian section, half meat section with lamb and chicken options. Complimentary naan is offered."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!! This place is moving to the top of the list! ;)"}
{"text":"Well, what can I say...we went to our favorite Indian restaurant again today. First time enjoying Indian food in this new year. I had my chicken biryani and my girl had chicken tikka masala with garlic naan. Food was delicious like always. Even better customer service by our favorite waiter Gary. Wish I could give this place 10 stars. Amazing food and Awesome Vibes. Can't wait to go back with our friends. Keep up the great work Gary. Hands down the Best customer service."}
{"text":"Were so happy to have found this place. Everything we tried was excellent and they were great about making a few dishes non-spicy for the small kids in our family. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I tried vegetarian food here with my family. Very delicious. Malai Kofta, house specialty is a must have with Garlic Naan. 
Average service."}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times now...

This place is another good Indian spot in Vegas that does Chicken korma very well...so well in fact that my gf and I get the same exact thing instead of getting two different dishes and sharing.

I remember having lamb vindaloo once and that was also very good...they'll spice it up according to your liking.

The portions are good, the place is clean and the service is friendly.

It's seldom crowded so there's always parking in the small parking lot in front.

Be sure to check for groupon and restaurant.com deals.

They also have a lunch buffet but I'm seldom East of the strip to hit it."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service and friendly people. I'll definitely be back. The lamb curry was my favorite."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, large quantity, friendly staff, and a custom made ginger tea. Definitely the place to go if you want to eat Indian!"}
{"text":"This place has a great lunch buffet that run about $8.50... The food was excellent and the staff was very friendly and fast... I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"By far the best indian food in Vegas. Great buffet and ala carte. Avoid South Indian food like dosas though"}
{"text":"15 BUCKS FOR LUNCH BUFFET IS TOO DISAPPOINTING..
Eek! Methinks not @ all.
Prices are all wrong mentioned here may be a strategy to entice customer. Its 15$ guys each plate. Families if you have a kid even aged 2 you will be charged. Pathetic food would not recommend to anyone.Find your own seating and rub your shoulders with other customers.Simple AN EYE WASH..
I didn't used the bathroom @ everything was very packed.You should definitely consider other options like MINT I like it Or Tamba or India Masala Bar and Grill and there is one Chinese very well within budget China One .You must try before this one is last left restaurant on earth..."}
{"text":"If you love FOOD this is the place for you!! Best Indian food in town! The food is heavenly and the service is amazing. Our food comes out quick and is always delicious. The staff is super friendly and the prices are great. One of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"I wish I could get here more often. The service is very good and the food is amazing. The seating is nice. This place is much better than more popular places I won't mention.  Took a friend here and we were both very pleased. Everything was top notch. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Out of all the Indian spots here in Vegas this is definitely my favorite. Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Rack Tandoori are my favorite dishes! The lamb tandoori always comes out sizzling hot to your table and the chicken tikka is always the right amount of spice and good portion of chicken. Also, we order Goat Curry but I wasn't too much of a fan. I usually don't step out of my comfort food when it comes to Indian food. Personal preference; if it's not Bryani, Tikka Masala or Lamb chances are I won't be a fan. Regardless though my out of town friends and family always rave about this spot when we stop by. It's always a go to for them. 

If you want something spicy their scale goes from 1-5 order a 4 for some mild spicy and 5 for their medium spicy. We got a 3 and there was no taste of spicyness here. That's pretty consistent from my previous visits. However, they serve complimentary chili and dipping sauces with flatbread. A little of the green and red chutney sauces goes a long way. 

The service is great though! The gentlemen are always full of smiles and check on their tables often. They were even kind enough to let us use two of the Yelp $20 for $12 deals. Probably because we had a really, really big to go order as well. The food was able to stay nice and hot and no spills on the joy ride home for my family to enjoy as well. It all came in a paper bag and was secured tightly. I mean that's really important when you order curry and you have a long ride home. 

On your way out next to the toothpicks they have these seed looking things. I'm not sure what they're called off the top of my head but I will be sure to update when I remember. Regardless take a teaspoon full and eat it. It helps settle your stomach and it's a culture remedy for heavy foods."}
{"text":"I have been there 4 times. Each time I come away thinking I should have started to eat Indian food sooner.  Our server was Vic.  He was very helpful and friendly.  This is a place I will come back to.  I think the pricing is a little high, but I always come away satisfied with my evening."}
{"text":"Very pleasant ambiance. I did'nt care much about the food but maybe it was what I ordered"}
{"text":"Even better the second time around! Great service and great food. Tried the Cheesy Nann and it was very tasty. Chicken Korma and the Lamb Rogan Josh were excellent. A little pricey but you get what you pay for.  We used the Yelp $30 for $20 deal so it took a bit of the sting out. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I did the lunch buffet here on a Tuesday.  I could not have been more impressed with the food on the buffet line, which included two lamb dishes--my favorite.  All the other usual suspects were represented, too, from curried chicken to veggie korma. Everything tasted really high quality and freshly prepared.  Even the white basmati rice was flavorful. The price was a mere $10/pp and included a generous basket of nan bread.  The dining room was tastefully furnished and appeared quite clean, though I didn't have occasion to use the restroom. I see numerous return trips in the future!"}
{"text":"This my FAVORITE place to eat when I'm in Vegas! The food is beyond excellent and the spices and flavor are over the top! The chicken masala is to die for! Korma is amazing... Vindaloo was soooo good! I also enjoy the vegetarian plate where you can choose four different dishes to sample in smaller portions. The garlic naan and chile naan are so delicious. You would never expect this little hole is the wall could be so good but you will not be disappointed! Gary is our favorite waiter! He will take very good care of you! Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Food was not that great . Ordered Biryani and Chicken Pakora. Biryani was soggy and not upto the level ."}
{"text":"I met up with my indian friend here for the lunch buffet.

If you get the tendori chicken while it's fresh it can't be beat.  They have this deep fried veggie ball that when paired with the chutnay is magicial.  The naan is always fresh and amazing.

The only problem is it's a buffet and most everything had been sitting out for a while.  The rice was old, the chicken marsala was over salted, and the goat was still chewy with many splintered bones.  

Kheer is amazing.  But you needed to asj for gulab.  If they have it you won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"I came in for the lunch buffet and I was surprised they had more options than my usual Indian rotation (Mint and Mt. Everest). However, this place was quantity more than quality. The goat curry was really salty. Like really. It masked the flavor of whatever spices they put. The vegetable mikhana (veggie tikka masala) was off. Way off to a point it was sourish. However, the chicken mikhana, (chicken tikka masala) was actually tasty. I guess they cook it differently. The chicken was so tender it was shredding apart. I enjoyed their Palak Paneer as well. But the paneer was too tough for my taste; it couldn't pick up the flavor of the spinach and spices. Overall, I would not be able to fit this place into my rotation. 
However, service was great! My water was never empty and I was downing that water like crazy because of the goat curry. 
I went in on a Tuesday and they charged me 11.95 which is not right according to the information on this listing, or maybe they overcharged me."}
{"text":"We went to their buffet after seeing reviews in yelp but had huge disappointment, the restaurant was empty and not many items in the buffet, the food quality and taste was very much below average, 
Also I felt the waiter was not very friendly

Overall I can say definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"For my Indian, I generally stick to lunch buffets, but this week a craving hit around dinner time, and when I noticed the Yelp Deal, I decided it was a perfect excuse to visit India Palace again. The environment is still nice with the added enhancement of MTV India playing on the TV screens, and when the complimentary chutney and papadum hit the table, my stomach did a little dance of joy. I thought things were going to be great. Unfortunately, the rest of the meal was moderate. The highlight was the friendly server assistant named Adam. 

I started with the Dal soup, and that really soured the meal. When it arrived at the table, it looked like water complete with little frothy bubbles on the edge. I gave it a stir, and the dal was there, but when I took a slurp, it also tasted like water. I rarely send anything back, but after my husband tasted it, he insisted. Oddly, the server came out to tell me it was supposed to be watery and perhaps I meant to order Dal instead, not the soup. To make a long story short: they brought out another bowl of soup, this time with less water, but with what tasted like a heavy helping of salt. I planned on just having it sit on the table, but the server assistant insisted on taking it off the bill. In short, this experience leads me to believe that when you order Dal soup, they take a serving of Dal and add water as that is how it tastes and appears. 

For our entrees, we ordered the korma and chicken karahi and both were good. I thought the flavor of the korma was better, but I was not impressed with the variety or freshness of the featured vegetables. However, the chicken in the karahi was white meat and tender. We ate everything with roti, and while the first order came out lukewarm, our second order was piping hot and great. I recommend pacing your bread order to ensure the hottest, freshest serving!

I also think it's worth mentioning that whenever our server interacted with us he gave me the distinct impression that he thought we knew next to nothing about Indian food, and perhaps we don't, but his demeanor made me uncomfortable for most of the meal. Adam saved the night for sure.

The end."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the BEST Indian food I've ever had! 

During my stay in Vegas, I Yelped for an Indian Restaurant and found this gem of a palace! Purchased their $20 for $12 Yelp Deal and crossed my fingers.

The restaurant was located not too far from the strip but a little too far to walk. My companions and I paid about $15 each way for a taxi but it was well worth it!

We ordered the Bombay Fish and Vegetable Samosas for appetizers; both were delicious! The samosas are a little on the spicier side for those more sensitive to heat. 

For our entrées, we ordered the Vegetarian dinner, Chicken Tika Masala and Garlic Naan. Everything was exceptionally delicious! We had more than enough to feed 3 people and had remaining leftovers to take with us! 

For lovers of Indian cuisine staying in Vegas, I highly recommend Indian Palace!"}
{"text":"The restaurant closes at 10:30 and I placed the phone order at around 10pm. I did inform that we will likely reach at 10:30 even then we were let in.
If I tried this in Chicago area, they won't even entertain you. So I find this service really 5 star worthy. 

We ordered Matar paneer, Karahi paneer, dal makhani, rotis and rice. 
Everything was good and they did not charge us for the rice."}
{"text":"Awesome food and desserts.
I had lunch buffet and all of their items were awesome ( I had vegetarian food)  and their kheer is a must!"}
{"text":"Typical liars.  I just went through a painstaking process of choosing items from their online menu for delivery only to be told \"we dont deliver\"  I called them on their lie since they advertise that they do both online and on their website.  They even have an online delivery order tool.  I got pissed, telling them how much time I wasted trying to order vegan for a big party.  They admitted that they selectively didnt deliver tonight, then hung up on me.  False advertising. They deserve to lose business."}
{"text":"Had the garlic naan bread and Lamb Korma, spicy. Spiciness level was perfect and the garlic naan was very good. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I found a groupon for India Palace so we thought we would give it a try. We've recently moved from NYC and haven't found our go-to indian spot...until today! Great food. We had Baingan Bharta, Bhindi Masala, and garlic naan of course. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very worst food..and no mineral water. .
U could see lumps of white rice in chicken biryani..and one more they charged for extra raitha..and very high price for items but low quantity. ."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Nothing disappointed. Chicken soup came with the Mixed Curry Dinner. Meh, I thought. It was a surprise, being in a masala curry base. I ate the whole bowl it was so good. I would go for that alone. I ordered Ghoa Fish Curry which the waiter tried to steer me from to the house's most popular fish dish, being a first time customer. I really wanted Ghoa though and was a little worried, but it was excellent. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Definitely will come back again!
This and Tandoori Times 2 are super good Indian cuisine in this area.
I was a little skeptical when my boyfriend and I were seated. Right away they bought 2 dips (I think one was cilantro chutney) and poori (thin crispy bread - almost like chips) and poured 2 glasses of water. Super tastey! But it took a good 10 minutes for our server to come up to us. I finally asked someone if we could order and he thought we were already taken care of. Despite that the food was really good. We ordered Raita $1.95 and 2 orders of Vegetable Samosas $2.95 each. Very yummy! I ordered the Vegetable Korma $9.95 so good and my bf ordered the Lamb Curry $9.95. I think the prices are really good for the food. We also ordered 2 orders of naan which were $1.50 each. Overall great Indian food for a good price - will def return!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Started coming here 2 months ago and the food is so flavorful and delicious. The service is also amazing!!! U want some great Indian food I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Really good Indian food, of you are Maharashtrian you will love the food. Very friendly staff. Feels like I am in India. Specially dal tadkha was awesome. Hard to find authentic dall like this. Majja as gaya . Good luck guys. And thanks for serving its sick delusions food."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem while doing laundry. If you want great service, food, and at a reasonable price I highly recommend. Absolutely loved their menu and portion sizes."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for dinner recently and the food is insanely delicious. They start you off at dinner with Papadom, these wafers that are simple yet tasty. They have an onion appetizer, onion Bhaji, that is deep fried with garbanzo flour, which is gluten free, and it was almost like eating onion rings, something I really miss being GF. The onions have a wonderful flavor. The Chicken Tikka Masala has to be my favorite dish but the Lamb Vindaloo is a close second. I went there for lunch the other day since I work close by and it was a buffet with a good variety of dishes. There was also a hot chai tea that was very flavorful and spicy plus a rice dessert that was pretty yummy. The buffet was just under $10, a very reasonable price for a buffet.The service is attentive, the food comes out pretty quickly and it's a good experience all around. This place gets two thumbs up in my opinion."}
{"text":"Probably, my favorite Indian place. Everything I have ever had here is delicious. It's also a good deal when you buy the yelp offer and when you check in you can get a free mango lassi which is like a mango milk smoothie. The bread, samosas, and the chicken masala have lots of flavor and good.

PROS: Everything
CONS: bad location"}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night and ordered 
1. Vegetable samosa appetizer $4.50
2. Tandoori Chicken dinner $25.95
for $5 (Used the $15 groupon to get $30 credit, came out to $.49)

- Seated right away. Fancy restaurant. Dim-lighting. Wine style cup glasses. 
- Edwin was a friendly server! He seemed to appreciate that we came in to eat Indian food and made sure that our drinks were refilled and the food made to our liking
- They didn't have the lamb samosa tonight, which we were a bit disappointed so we ended up with the vegetable. Comes with 2. Cooked fresh and crispy. 
- You are given complimentary flat bread and 3 types of sauces, mild, med, hot. Flat bread tasted a bit burnt, but crispy. 
- Garlic naan was fluffy 
- chicken soup was watery but spicy. 
- Mango dessert was good. Tasted like Filipino fruit salad. 
- Fried vegetables were a bit smushy.
- Tandoori chicken was a slighly dry and the onoins were grilled inconsistently, undercooked or overcooked.  
- India Masala and Mint Bistro packs more flavor for my liking than India Palace, but nonetheless, still a good eat especially with the Groupon!"}
{"text":"This Indian restaurant is likely the worst Indian food I have ever eaten. My husband is Indian so I know good Indian food when I eat it, and this was definitely not it. 

Let's start first with the appearance. I walk in and I'm greeted by beautiful decor (huge plus on the styling) and I think \"man this food is gonna be so good!!\" I'm seated and the table is dirty....ok not a big deal because they can just wipe it down right? Wrong. Utensils and napkins are also dirty?? Um aren't there sanitation codes places have to live up to?! 

I hit the buffet and immediately notice there is no substance to any of the dishes, like they're literally WATERY. Ok so the thing with Indian dishes, most of the sauces are thick, like tomato based or chickpea and they're awesome to dip your naan in. 

Literally all of the buffet dishes lacked any and all substance. The ground lamb was gross and watery, the chicken tikka masala was gross and watery. The kadhi was labeled 'yogurt curry' but it had this bitter, strange, rotten taste. The gulab jamun was stone cold (for those who've never eaten, it's like a super fatty donut that's warm and delicious). The custard was clumpy, tasted like it was off the shelf gits (Indian store brand). The vegetable pakora was cold, all batter and no vegetables. The lamb curry was more water than lamb or curry. The naan was cold, tea was watered down, and their plain old water tasted awful, like it had been sitting in possible rusty pipes.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I gave it a fair go by trying multiple different dishes and I was appalled by them and even more so for the buffet price. Their food overall is disgusting, and I can guarantee I will not darken their doorstep again."}
{"text":"We had a special deal for this place while visiting Vegas so we tried it. Absolutely no doubt some of the best Indian food we have ever eaten. The only disadvantage to this restaurant is that it is way off the strip and difficult to get to unless you walk a mile or take a cab. The restaurant itself is extremely clean the service is excellent and the food is awesome. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you want Indian food while you were in Vegas however just expect to pay for transportation unless you have your own car. The rice is perfect the naan bread was absolutely delicious and we shared a vegetable korma dish that was absolutely divine. If you want inexpensive after dinner cocktails or drinks go to the bar right next door to the restaurant we were able to get five drinks for less than 10 bucks. The prices of this restaurant are very reasonable considering the high quality of food."}
{"text":"Very good service and the food was excellent oh gotta get the fish melts in your mouth !"}
{"text":"Awesome dishes! U gotta try the chicken tikka masala and goat kadai. Finish off our dinner with the Mango lassi & it tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"This was just the worst thing ever. I go there I made a reservation for 6 but they give me a table of 2. So we waited 15 mins for a table. When we ordered they took 40 mins for food and on top of that the food was horrible. By the time we got of the restaurant it was 11 and we got there at 7:30. Plus we live 6 hours away so by the time we got home it was 5:30"}
{"text":"For there for the lunch buffet right as the restaurant was opening. Food was wonderful and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"A few of the staff members are sour pusses but others are very nice. 
Lunch buffet is ok but dinner menu is much better. 
Spicy Saag Aloo/paneer and Spicy Navertan Korma (vegetarian) with basmati rice, rieta and garlic Naan are my staples. That and a fistful of fennel as im leaving to calm the stomach ache on its was from how spicy it is. 
Northern Indian and DELICIOUS 
Always bollywood music videos playing LOL"}
{"text":"oh man this was good.!! taste and ambiance of the place was nice. 

chicken masala was good.

The waiter was nice explained some dishes he new it was my first time here when I asked for beef curry...my bad.. 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"Great food! Love the iced tea and naan! Been here a few times and will continue to visit."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner buffet, food was awful with uncooked rice and bland desert.
overpriced bad food."}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Flavor - Probably one of my favorite India restaurants in town. The lamb is tender and not overcooked like other places.
       - Price/Portions - The prices are on par with other Indian restaurants but the portions are definitely a lot smaller.
       - Locale - The restaurant is located in a pretty bad neighborhood and the parking lot is dimly lit.
       - Decor - Though it might not look it from the outside, the inside is quite nice.
       - Lunch Buffet - They have a lunch buffet for $11.95 which I think is a way better deal. Moreover, I wouldn't want to be in that neighborhood at night anyway.
**Ordered**
       - $14.95 Chicken Tikka Masala - Creamy and delicious, this curry is a must try.
       - $15.95 Lamb Rogan Josh - The lamb was tender. The curry was a tomato base and wasn't as thick as other curries.
       - $2.95 Garlic Naan - Your standard garlic naan, fluffy and soft.
       - $3.95 Cheese Naan - They added cheese to regular naan. It kinda tasted like a cheese pizza, but better.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd definitely recommend this place. However, if you don't mind which meal, I'd say go to the lunch buffet for a wider selection and a way better deal."}
{"text":"Ok l'm livid. This is not cheap delivery. We ordered pickup 15 minutes before arriving and waited an additional 45 MINUTES in the restaurant for two dishes. It didn't come with utensils and when I asked three times for utensils, they said they would need an additional 5 minutes to prepare the utensils. And it isn't like this place is short staffed. There were only two groups eating in the restaurant but 3 chefs and 4 waiters just standing around. Food might be ok, but it doesn't make up for atrocious service."}
{"text":"India Palace had catered a wedding at my work a month ago. Seeing the satisfaction of the native diners drew me to try this place out. I had originally wanted to use my groupon, but that offer cannot be combined with the lunch buffet. Instead, I opted for my sister to try some new dishes and determine new favorites. No fear about the unused groupon, next time I will return for dinner. Although I might have failed with my initial mission, the free mango lassi for my first check-in made up for it. The yogurt drink was a nice balance of tart and sweet. Really refreshing for the muggy weather we have been experiencing.

With the Fourth of July over, and done with, my meat intake had thrown me off balance. To offset the BBQ, no cuisine is better than Indian for when you feel like dining on good vegetarian friendly dishes. Did I choose to stay completely meat free? No, I could not resist a few pieces of goat in a curry sauce, a piece of tandoori chicken, and some chicken vindaloo. All of these dishes were fantastic. Nothing was overly salty or sweet. Instead they had strong herbal or spice accents that did not mask the meat. The cilantro chutney only intensified the sensations within my mouth. Now for the real reason why I love Indian food. The paag paneer was addictive and tasted wonderful with the fresh garlic naan. Nice pieces of cottage cheese were found throughout the creamy spinach mixture. The dhal curry was also a favorite. The complex spices in this yellow lentil soup is great over rice, or just eaten straight. Do not forget to help yourself to some kheer. This creamy rice pudding is thinner than the kind you will find in Mediterranean restaurants, but has slivers of almonds within. 

The buffet is open from 11:30-3:00 for a reasonable $11.99."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and decided to try this place based on reviews.  It was as good as they said.  The service was amazing and the food was fantastic.  If we lived in the area, we would be back.  The tikki masala is a must have!  Best we ever had."}
{"text":"Sunday night: January 10, 2010. Indian Food Heaven. My bf yelped this place while we were thinking of a place to grub my last night in Vegas before heading back home Monday morning. When we first walked in, I thought, \"Wow...tons of Indian customers and wow...very classy spot.\" We started off with some flat breads and a couple different dipping sauces. Very delicious! For our entrees we ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Curry and of course being total mcfatties we ordered 2 different types of Naan bread. Ohhhh how I love Naan and ohhhh how they made them just right! And to finish off with dessert we ordered some Indian ice cream, I had the pistachio and he ordered the mango. Very different, but very good as well. The service was also quite excellent. I definitely didn't think we'd find an awesome Indian restaurant as this one that night. Definitely gotta try this place out if you're ever in Vegas and looking to dine off the strip."}
{"text":"Decided to go vegetarian with couple of friends and ordered Malai Kofta, Matter Paneer, Baigan Bhartha and all three items were excellent. The bread basket was great value and nans were perfect. Service by Garry was awesome. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This was my 7th or 8th time here and every time I come here, it been an amazing experience. Whenever I am in Vegas, this place is a must to visit.

Sometimes they are busy so it is always great to make reservations here.

Once you get seated, you are seated, you are served papad with mint and tamarind chutney and they are amazing

We usually order the same thing as they are delicious. Our order always is Rack of Lamb, Mix Grill, chicken tikka masala with Cheese and Plain Naan 

Rack of Lamb here are the best you will have in Vegas. They are Juicy and tender with Indian spices. They are so soft that it will melt in your mouth

The mix grill have fish, chicken and beef with different kind of kebabs. It comes fresh to your table.

The chicken tikka masala is with gravy and house special. It is crazy good with Cheese Naan.

Another must have is their sweet or mango lassi. It thick and delicious 

Everything I go here, it's an amazing experience. This place is one if those places that if you go to Vegas and don't go here, you are doing it wrong, especially if you like Indian food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here tonight.  We had a restaurants.com coupon and needed to spend $50 to get $25 off.  

  We started out with a bread basket with cheese, garlic and lamb naans, and onion kulcha.  The lamb naan was particularly tasty, but all four were fresh, hot and flavorful.  

    We then had the vegetable pakora, which was like deep fried vegetable fritters.  They were nice and crispy  

   My girlfriend, having Indian food for the first time, went with the safe choice of the chicken tikka.  Just about right spice-wise for her and she enjoyed the dish.  I, however had the lamb pasanda.  I ordered it with a spice level of 7 out of 10.  It came out perfect for my spicy taste.  It had a nice bite without overpowering the exotic flavorful blend of spices in the sauce. 

  All in all, we loved the food.  The service was a bit slow, even though there was only one other table of people when we got there.  The waiter also tried to change my mind when I made my entree selection, which was a bit annoying.  Apparently he thought a different dish would have been better suited to me.  The decorum was very nice, until you got to the tv hanging on the wall.  It kind of ruined the mood set by the lighting and the paintings.  Price wise we got a LOT of food for $50, enough to feed 4 people, but we will enjoy the leftovers.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great place. Very good spicy Indian food. We used the groupon so we had to go with ala-cart. Bombay fish is good. Very good service. Prompt and quick. We ordered keema lamb minced naan. Very unique but well done. the buffet also looked very good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time having Indian food and it was definitely a wonderful experience! Absolutely delicious food!"}
{"text":"My friends and I always finish our trip to Vegas with some indian food and usually go to Mint. This time Mint was packed and had a long wait so we decided to venture to India palace. The quality of the tikka massla is superb!  Moist and tender, and very favorful! They didn't have garlic naan readily available but when we asked they made it happen! Service is great! We'll we be back and probably make this place a new tradition. The only bad thing I can say is they didn't have a variety of dessert and didn't have my favorite indian dessert Halva and Galb jamun."}
{"text":"Went there for a buffet on Sunday. The lamb was horrible. It was like diced lamb and good luck in finding those pieces.

Talk about tandoori chicken and I know it was a buffet but still it was so dried out and yes I am talking about the dark meat pieces.

If you want great food go to mint India and not this place."}
{"text":"In the past few months, maybe since September 2012, this place has gone downhill. The quality of dishes served on the lunch buffet is not the same as it once was. Because I always make it a point to eat here during lunch this is a huge issue. The difference has been noticed by several people that I dine here with who now refuse to eat here anymore. The first time I noticed it I thought maybe they were just having an off day. I came in for lunch 3 more times over the past few months with other people because we were in the area but it was unmistakable, the food here is not nearly as good as it used to be. I noticed that there is one gentleman that always worked here that is no longer here and I suspect this has something to do with the change. I truly hope the food gets better, but I won't be back in to find out any time soon with so many other options nearby."}
{"text":"The food and service here are outstanding. Authentic and delicious.Prices are more than reasonable and the portions are perfect.
Try it out , you will love it."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet and came away very pleased, with the exception of the crazy lady seated behind us rambling and talking about weird, crazy shit. The food was fresh, tasty and we enjoyed many of the different dishes we tried. It's been a long day and I can't remember exactly what we had by name but we'll definitely be going back... The tikka masala was great! :)"}
{"text":"Great Indian food! The Baingan Bharta is sooo delicious!  The have some really excellent meat dishes as well---the Tandoori chicken is marinated wonderfully.  

The staff is super friendly and the prices are very reasonable.  Love it! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Indian food place I have ever been to my whole life! I highly recommend it! Personally I don't even like Indian food due to my less than satisfying experience in the past. But this place came on top and totally won me over!

The decor is very neat and simple, the sitting is not overly crowded. The Indian waiter somehow knows to speak some Japanese which trips me out even more while my white friend who is returning to Japan speaks fluent Japanese. They have a decent selection of all kinds of meat from chicken to fish. Since I dont know what is good and I didnt have great experiences with Indian food in the past, I just went on the safe bet. I ordered the butter chicken. 

The food came fairly fast. In a small bowl there were huge chunks of chicken sitting in a lot of less than thick sauce that I have been used to see in other less than Indian, Indian restaurants. My first reaction is \"Oh NO, why the chicken is so chunky, its going to be tasteless and hard\". Surprisingly the chicken were EXTREMELY tender and juicy and flavorful! Not sure how they made chicken breasts that good! I ordered nah bread to go with it. They came in HUGE pieces. The nah I had in the past were small and thin like pitta bread, but the ones they served at this place were huge and fluffy, slightly crunch and very soft inside. It looks dry but much softer than pita bread. And it's because its thicker, it has more texture and get to dip more flavorful butter chicken sauce. It was unbelievably delicious! I couldnt even finish it, so I had to pack it to go. It's been sittiing in my fridge for 3 days, I just opened them today heated up with micro wave, both chicken and the nan break both tasted fresh! 

I'd love to try other dishes next time when I come back, there something seafood on the menu looks quite interesting. Also my friends ordered some special nan bread its almost like nan with cheese/butter on top almost like soft garlic bread. It was SOO good! 

I can't wait to go back there and bring my friends there to try. I highly recommend that place. Order the butter chicken! Its the best thing ever!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. As you walk in the pictures with various celebrities welcomes you and sets the bar high on the food quality. The waiter was a little rude himself and was not properly attending us. Secondly, only a few hand picked  food items are good. It was interesting to find 
 the quality of dosas well done in North Indian restaurant (Punjabi) but the actually North Indian dishes made from paneer ( Shahi and palak) were not that great. This is a good place to try but not a place I would frequent very often during my business or personal trips."}
{"text":"Was just passing through town and stopped on a whim.  The food was excellent and a full serving.  The service was great.  Clean and friendly.  I wish I could visit more often!"}
{"text":"Best Indian lunch buffet in a town where the Indian lunch buffets I've tried aren't particularly fantastic.  No comments on any non-buffet action as I haven't had it.

Located right near the convention center for all of you out-of-towners, but also not in a particularly good neighborhood the further you head away from the Strip.  Still though, if you're in that area of town it's a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"I seriously had no what to order when I came here. My friend and I just stared at the menu for the longest time!! Haha. Of course at the vegetarian menu. Great selection, so much to choose from. Just didn't know what to order. So I LITERALLY close my eyes and pointed to one.
I got the chili vegetables. And the palak paneer. And....I forgot the other name of the dish. But oh my gosh. I love all my dishes. Different texture for sure, not use to it. But i like it. :D
The staff was great, slow with our drinks, but overall it was a good place for dinner."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. The food is consistently great as well as the service. Palak Paneer is one of my favorite dishes and I have yet to find a place that does it better. Even got my wife to try it!"}
{"text":"Such great food!  A wonderful way to spend lunch hour with my oldest daughter on her birthday!  Food is fresh and tastes great!   The prices are fair for a buffet!"}
{"text":"For being in a highly tourist concentrated area (it's 5 mins away from the Las Vegas strip) this restaurant is fantastic! My family of four was greeted and seated immediately  by Vick. He was kind and went out of his way to make suggestions and even make jovial conversation! The food was fantastic and the portions large considering we have enough left overs to make a meal out of. Would definitely recommend to tourists and locals alike."}
{"text":"I had the chicken tikka masala and it was delicious. I would have to say this is probably the best masala I have tasted in a long time and I have been to many Indian restraunts around the country.  The Bryani also was tasty! I will be back soon! The flavors were amazing in all the dishes I tried.

{"text":"Why is Indian lunch buffet always so cheap and delicious? Like when did all the Indian restaurants decide to put a bunch of delicious food in front of us, and only charge $10 for us to stuff our faces?

I'd like to go back in time to see that realization, because it's essentially one of the best modern-day inventions.

India Palace obviously has a $10.99 lunch buffet, just like every other Indian place in this strip. I haven't had lunch buffet at all of them (yet) but I can tell you some great things about this place:

- Huge selection of buffet items. The buffet itself seems rather small compared to Mandarin or other mega buffets, but once you're up there and you are filling up your plate, you will soon realize that 1 or 2 trips just aren't enough and you will be stacking your food in layers.

- Friendly service and fast water refills! Both are key. Staff were so nice to us and thanked us a gazillion times for eating there.

- DELICIOUS food. Duh.

I've now been to each of the three Indian restaurants on this block, and I think they're all good, but India Palace and Little India next door are both great. Great is better than good, especially when it comes to food."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpian Ryan C. organized a little luncheon at India Palace yesterday (see, it's not only ladies who lunch, sometimes it's us manly men, too:)

I made the pilgrimage from OTowSco to the near reaches of NW PHX and met up with Ryan, Rand, Norm, Daren and Wes and we talked and laughed and we hit the boofay at India Palace pretty hard:)

Pretty good boofay...not terribly extensive as far as the food selections go...but the available items were all well prepared, well seasoned and my lunch ended up on the happy end of the \"Crap to Quality Ratio\":)

As we dug into our first plate of boofay, Ryan said \"I hope everybody filled up on bananas and cheese\"...a humorous comment about lubricative effects of the food at India Palace:)

In a happy coincidence, he almost exactly described my breakfast yesterday morning...4 bananas and a  1/2 pound of Tillamook Sharp Cheddar:)

When you get to be my age, the adage \"never trust a fart after 50\" isn't just a funny thing to say...it becomes one of the guiding principles in your life...so, bananas and cheese...all the curry's and tandoori's  and vegetarian squash/potato stuff and vindaloo's with basmati rice and naan in the joint aren't going to break through this particular firewall:-)

Oatmeal would have just been throwing gas (no...gasoline, not GI tract methane) on the fire (oh wait...that would work too:)

Although I'm not generally a fan of boofays (I really do think the \"sneeze guards\" seem to be just a suggestion to many of the people that I see rooting around in the boofay) this was a pretty clean and well maintained boofay...I had 2 plates of pretty decent Indian food and got a chance to relax for few minutes with friends and have a little light conversation:)

Things stayed sealed up tight and I sailed through the rest of my day with the confidence, dignity and demeanor of a man who knows that everything is safely locked down:)"}
{"text":"The management at this place has no regard for it's patrons whatsoever. We came in for a Lunch buffet and the food selection was sub par to say the least. We were a group of 4 and we were treated with such disrespect that it is appalling. We tried using a yelp deal and not only were they unwilling to accept it they were very rude about telling us that it they cannot take it. The rest rooms at this place were the worst of all the restaurants in Vegas. I'd give no stars if I could.Avoid this place like a plague. There are much better Indian restaurants around"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but you really do need the yelp or groupon deal just to make up for the $12 you'll spend on rice for 4 people. That's ridiculous...it's rice! The saag and bread options were good, but I wasn't impressed enough to want to return or pay that much for rice again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch buffet at about 1:30 on a Wednesday.  It was pretty quiet. It is one of very few business left in this less than stellar strip mall.  But don't let it fool ya or discourage you.  Inside is clean and colorful, with plenty of room for larger groups.    I would have to say there was a lot to choose from and all was hot fresh and full of flavor.  The naan was nice hot and fresh off the griddle.  I was very pleased and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch and can see myself going back in the near future. Yum!"}
{"text":"This was pretty good food, service was pretty good and great prices.  Had the buffet and some pretty good options."}
{"text":"So freaking good! My sister took me for my birthday and we ordered the Lamb vindaloo, basmati rice,  Chicken Tikki Marsala, Garlic naan and, the Shrimp Tandoori.  So delicious and the portions were huge and made more than what was paid for which in itself is amazing. Lovely cozy Place."}
{"text":"I definitely have issues doing dinner at an Indian restaurant that does a lunch buffet.  It doesn't make total sense but I usually prefer Origin India just for that reason.  But it was late, we had the craving and my wife had a great experience (lunch buffet) the last time she was here so we gave it a go.  

The place was still full of people at 9pm so that was a plus.  I was excited to see dosa on the menu but the waiter told me their grill wasn't on and it would take at least 30 minutes to get ready.  Ok. Nevermind.  There's a free mango lassi with a Yelp check in.  He tells us it's only good for one lassi per table.  Fine!

We unintentionally went vegetarian for the evening.  My wife always gets the saag paneer extra spicy and I went with the matar paneer.  Both dishes were very good.  The peas in my matar paneer were super sweet.  Maybe the sweetest pea I've ever had.  I devoured them.  The naan was pretty good but the aloo paratha wasn't worth the extra $1.50.  

I'll be back to try the lunch buffet but I think I am done with dinner here.  Use the Yelp deal!!"}
{"text":"Great friendly attentive service and prototypical Indian food. Would eat here again! (and in fact, I did the next night). This place is fantastic. It's a typical in-town establishment that seats less than 50 people, so it's cozy and warm. The service is very friendly and attentive and the food is great. On my two trips here I had beef vindaloo (lip-tingly hot!) and ginger chicken (this was a special recommended to me by the server, so I'm not sure of the dish's name), garlic naan (wow!). I also sampled samosa and aloo pakora.  Of all the items I sampled, my least favorite was the pakora - I'm assuming it was the gram flour (chickpea) used for the fritter. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't my favorite. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had the lamb vindaloo and my wife had the chicken sagwala. Mine was very tasty and my wife said hers was delicious. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I have had better in other cities. I would definitely come back here though if I visit Vegas again. Service was also great. The garlic naan was great as well."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and myself and three friends decided to grab some Indian food. I'm from England and have eaten Indian food at many 
places. This is certainly one of the best experiences. Manny our server was fantastic! He was very friendly, outgoing and really catered to our needs

When I'm back in town I will 100% return.

{"text":"I walked down here form the LVCC after a long day on the Consumer Electronics Show floor, and was pleasantly surprised.   The naan was tasty, the Navratan Korma a little different than what I'm used to, but still quite yummy- and the staff was attentive.

Wait.  No.

The staff was attentive until I tried to pay my bill.  That bit was sort of weird.  They were there JUST enough to perfectly take care of me but not be over-bearing.......until I tried to give them money.  One pint off for the long time I had to try to flag someone down to give them my debit card.

I'd definitely visit again- but next time, may just pile some cash on the table and wander out un-noticed when I'm done."}
{"text":"The food IS SO GOOD One of the best Chicken Tikka Masala I have ever eaten. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent delicious fresh healthy buffet at this friendly comfortable Indian restaurant. 

I have eaten here twice - once at a buffet and once for dinner. Both times we were very pleased with the ambiance, the comfortable seating, the nice quiet happy vibes, the competent and attentive yet not obtrusive service, and the very tasty excellent food.

The naan bread here has become my favorite naan of all time and of all places !  It's not overly thick as some places. Really a truly properly cooked naan. It's not over cooked and not undercooked. Just plain Perfection !!!

The folks who work there are so friendly and the food is so authentic and so delicious. You can order different spice heat levels at dinner. 

The mango lassi was delicious without being too overly disgustingly sweet like so many places mistakenly make it. 

The buffet is your best bet if you want to try ten or fifteen different entrees for the price of one !!!
That's truly an amazing deal.

This place is, in my opinion, underestimated and should be way busier - for all the high quality food, professional pleasant friendly service, and fresh healthy delicious flavors you're getting !

Plenty of parking available. Easy to find location. Good AC inside. Clean and crisp, well managed restaurant."}
{"text":"great taste of Indian food,  one of the best chicken Tikka masala I ever had in my 45 yrs of life.  As an Indonesian Chinese, I have had Indian foods in many countries, and India Palace is one of the best I have tried worldwide.

great friendly service, nearby Palazzo Hotel where we stayed.
Thank you !!!"}
{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet, very yummy!! Unfortunately they didn't have the chana masala, which i heard was very good, so I plan to go back and try that. I had a mango lassi, it was creamy and delicious, complemented the flavors of the food nicely. and the service was super friendly and attentive! Great decor too!"}
{"text":"Such a let-down!

I loved the ambience, and the Indian music videos broadcasting on televisions.  The waitstaff were prompt and polite.

I was disappointed to learn that the buffet is only served at lunch, not dinner.  I should have researched this beforehand.

I ordered the fish curry (dinner serving), naan and rice.  The rice was overcooked, the naan was burnt(!!), and the curry, prepared \"Medium\" spicy, was spiced but somehow wasn't spicy.  It was so deeply lacking flavor, I had to salt it to excess. 

There was also no vegetarian protein offered, and nearly a dozen beef dishes in their place, which is bizarre for an Indian restaurant (Hindus don't eat red meat). 

The pricing just didn't add up.  An entree with naan and a water came to $22 with tip. 

It seems like they've watered-down their food to appease the Average Joe eater.  Such a shame.  The end result is something extremely inauthentic, and flavorless."}
{"text":"Great tasty food. Amazing staff and sincerely nice owner! Service with a smile! We ordered paneer tikka, paneer masala and garlic naan."}
{"text":"I have to give this place five stars because my son and I crave their lamb curry. We have eaten there many, many times and it never fails to be delicious. We just call to make sure they have lamb curry on the buffet that day, otherwise we feel deprived. Their Naan is fresh and delicious and the rice pudding is also a favorite. The rest varies, but there is always something good to go with the lamb curry. They often also have a lamb dish that is like hamburger texture. It is okay, but not even close to the lamb curry dish. So make sure they have the lamb and give it a try. I think you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"This experience has virgin all over it.  The first time for real indian food. The first time at India Palace.  I can say that the it was extremely pleasant. The food was very good. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (medium spice). There was no hint of HOT, but the chicken was smokey and the sauce was delicious.  My husband ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh (medium spice). Again, not HOT, but delicious. We ordered the Aloo Tikki, a side of Peas Pulao and Garlic Naan.  We left no crumbs behind.  I will add, the hotest food I had that night was one of the three suaces that came with the flat bread.

The atmosphere was just right for my husband and I out for date night.  They had recently (within the last two years) renovated the place and it was nice. The neighborhood is in an older part of town, but close enough to the strip.

Although I have nothing to compare this too, I felt the need to express our satisfaction and desire to try the cuisine again and again."}
{"text":"Very good Hotel.. Food tasted really nice.. They have a $50 gift card for $40 that you may possibly use immediately if you bought this before seating. Also, they may give you 15% of if you are group of 5 or more.."}
{"text":"Superb food...excellent service....some of the staff are limited English proficient...but if you are interested in talking about India a nd food....they take great care of you.   No buffet after 3...but the dinner specials are 4 course meals with way too much food for one person.  My favorite...rack of lamb...best I ever had...cooked to perfection.   Lots of Indian locals come here.    Sunday brunch 14 bucks includes Champaign.  Parking not a problem because they aren't usually too busy.   One block off paradise at sands/ twain.   Don't walk here at night because it's not too safe.  Monorail goes right by and buses but left or taxis are easier"}
{"text":"Four people, table service; two who really know and love Indian food and two who love *this* place (though I am unsure of the breadth of knowledge on the cuisine itself). 

SERVICE:

The service was fantastic. Vick really took care of us and, having waited on my friends for the past four years, exuded a certain cameraderie that really brought everyone together. He made recommendations, made sure we wanted for nothing, and kept the meal moving forward without making us feel rushed in any way.

FOOD:

The food was mostly good. Not great, but good. Tasty enough to share amongst friends over a couple bottles of wine, and some good conversation.

The paneer pakora (cheese squares made of 2 layers of cheese with some thin herb/veggie spread in between, then battered and fried) was disappointing. Maybe the squares are too big and cool off too fast; it quickly becomes a hunk of room-temperature fried cheese. It didn't make think of Indian food as much as any other fried cheese product around town.

The chicken pakora was much like the cheese; it seemed like any other fried chicken strip. The flavors want to be there, but it's just not executed well enough. Not impressed.

The samosas were really tasty. The crusts were flaky and the stuffing was generous and flavorful. Layered flavors, a great kick of spice, and the textures were good. A highlight, for sure.

The sauces (mint, tamarind, and chili) were fantastic! Really, really flavorful and fresh. We refilled our sauce dishes at least twice. Best part of the meal.

The chicken tikka masala was tasty. Not the best in town, but tasty. We ordered one medium and one hot. The hot was truly HOT... pushing the line of too much (and therefore hiding some of the flavors). Still, the flavors were good and the chicken was tender. 

The peas pulao (basmati rice with peas and cashews) was pretty damn good, actually. I tasted a bite with a little of everything and really loved the freshness, the combination of flavors. Great complement.

The breads were good (my companions had to try at least four kinds?). I tasted a few small bits here and there and found them good. Again, not great. But good, worth trying.

COST/VALUE:

The apps and bread are priced well, especially for groups who want to get a few things and share. The entrees, however, are overpriced for what we received: appetizer size at entree prices. The tikka masala was tiny for what they charge and the rice was a la carte (also a bit pricey for what you get). Bad juju there, as your \"entree\" becomes a $20+ dish but it's just not a $20+ place. It wasn't my dime, but $200 for a group of four is a bit excessive for a place like this, even considering the wine.

OVERALL:

 Food (and value of same) made me think it was a 2-2.5 (edible, but I have had much better...) but the service and atmosphere was easily a 4.5! So, a 3-star, A-OK experience. 

I *would* go again with my friends as they have a special affinity for this place... but I'll also take them somewhere else when it's my turn to choose."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

SO FAR (I've been living here two months now) this is the best indian food place I've tried. Makes me wonder why the reviews are so average for this place? The service is so-so but the food was great! Had the tadoori chicken plate on a bed of onions and bell peppers, lamb curry, and garlic naan. Chicken was perfect, moist on the inside and had a nice grilled flavor. Lamb curry was perfectly spiced with tender pieces of lamb, and the potatoes were a nice touch. Naan came out hot, crispy and garlicky, great for dipping into the curry. Mango Lassi was not watered down and was the real deal. I actually had to ask for extra ice to dilute it because it was so thick, yay more lassi for me!

Price is pretty standard for a indian restaurant, but I'd want to come for the lunch buffet and try out some other dishes (chicken tikka masala, biryani).

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Naan arrived 10 or more minutes after we already picked up our food at the buffet. The second round around naan arrived after another 10 mins - this is after reminding 3 staff members and giving them a heads up to avoid the same delay as before. 
Food DEFINITELY not worth any of this. Customer service not their priority. 
Time to find another Indian Restaurant when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian food place in the Valley.  My wife and I have been to a few.  The Murg Mahkani is delicious and the Naan was most excellent!  Come here.  Just off of 17 and on Bell!"}
{"text":"Worst Indian food ever!! There are much better Indian restaurants in Vegas. Sour food , bad service and not worth your penny ! Never visiting again"}
{"text":"The waitstaff were very friendly and courteous.  The flavors were not your typical Indian flavors (my husband liked them; I prefer the traditional flavors).  My biggest issue was that they only seem to use onions- in everything.  My husband and I ordered 3 different dishes, and the only vegetable in any of the sauces were onions- large chunks of onions.  Saag paneer?  Yes, there were more large chunks of onions than there were chunks of paneer.  Tikka masala?  Yep.  Great proportion of meat to sauce- but just huge chunks of onions in there with the meat.  Lamb dish?  Yep.  More huge onion chunks.  It was in such excess that I don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Server Vick is the best!!!!! So charming, excellent customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch boofay the other day with my brother and his coworker was one of the best tasting lunches I've had here.

My recommendations: 
ask for Garlic Naan instead of plain, but be ready for fresh garlic breath all afternoon.

Go several times, since the about half of dishes they have out vary from day to day.  I've discovered that sometimes I'm not a fan of the items, but have been glad to try new things, since I've also found some unexpected gems. (don't expect me to remember the indian name, though)

Don't worry about crazy gimmicky coupon sites that just want to spam you all day.  This food is superb at the fair price they charge normally.  The owners are great, and staff is friendly and eager to serve."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this is not a restaurant I would return to. We eat Indian on  are regular basis, and I would say the food is average, maybe a bit above, however the main issue was the service.

Our waiter was extremely friendly, however we were there on a Friday night, and there was not a crowd, it was a best 20% full.  First, they had a full bar, but they were NOT serving drinks.  Apparently they sent the bartender out on a delivery, and no one else could mix drinks.  Why they did this on a Friday night is totally beyond me.

We also had issues with the waiter, while friendly, both waiters I noticed spent the majority of the night on the phone.  Not taking orders, just talking.  We struggled to get their attention when we needed to, and several things were missed on our order.

Food was extremely reasonable, however the service issues were simply too much for us to overcome, and thus we will not go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch buffet. Very dissatisfied with the food. Everything was so sour and poor quality. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a nice atmosphere representing the country of India. Reasonable pricing for the food. I went with a few friends and was able to have a satisfying meal. It was good food as agreed upon by all three of us. The staff although friendly and courteous, didn't know what was in some of the dishes. Not sure if she is new to the restaurant but it seemed like a question that should be answered by every employee. Nonetheless it was a good find."}
{"text":"This is THE Place for authentic North Indian food in the Vegas area. You want to order from the menu for the right spice levels. Very nice wait staff. This restaurant has better tasting Curries than Indian restaurants in LA. Highly recommend paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, dal. Even bhindi masala is fantastic. We were helped by a person called GARY. He is awesome! If he waits on your table you know you are gonna have a good meal :)"}
{"text":"Everytime my family and I have eaten at this restaurant, we haven't been disappointed. The service is wonderful and the food is one of the best in town."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch last weekend during our Vegas trip and what a let down this place has been. When we walked in there was no one there to direct us to the buffet or a table so we decided to just stand in line and pick up our food after which we had to search for a table and sit ourselves down. We flagged a server and asked for water which came almost at the end of our meal.

The food did not have any flavor at all and we felt that we were just stuffing our stomachs rather than enjoying a meal. The masala dosa was uncooked, tandoori chicken bland and i cannot even define the taste of the butter chicken. Finally we decided that you cant go wrong with dal rice but that again was under seasoned and tasteless. The sweet dish mentioned a mangao custard but it felt like thick mango nectar that was sweetened to the point of being inedible.

When the host was informed by one of our group members that the food could have been better he was arrogantly told that the food is purposefully kept bland to suite the taste requirements here. Well it is not about the spiciness of food but the taste that was non existent so we just decided to laugh and walk away."}
{"text":"After several visits to partake of the lunch buffet over the years, I'm still happy to return for some of the best saag paneer I've tried in Vegas. The vegetable korma and the great fluffy basmati rice are also standouts. Gladly would I give greater praise but for the following:

Fresh naan delivered to the table would be most welcome, instead of the rather dried out naan that sits in the heater tray in the buffet line. Also, while it is certainly quite authentic to serve water without ice (I experienced this repeatedly in India years ago), I should not have to ask (multiple times) for a glass of ice in which to pour my room temperature water (call me an American snob). Lastly, the buffet items should be served at a higher temperature. It's all in the details...."}
{"text":"Too bad I had to give even one star.  This place is obviously in a very bad financial bind.  We had our living social voucher and were using it last night on our anniversary.  The place was eerily quiet.  There was a note on the door-they decided they were no longer going to honor Living Social, Groupon or two other pre-purchased coupons.  We went inside and there was no one in the place but the hired help standing around.  I asked about why they no longer honored the voucher and the guy said something in a very soft voice which I am assuming was a reason.  I don't care how good the food supposedly is---let this place go under which it will undoubtebly be doing soon."}
{"text":"First time - won't be the last!

I like to rate businesses according to their competition, what you would expect there, or other comparable businesses. We decided to try India Palace because of the Yelp reviews (don't know how I didn't find this place sooner) and I was REALLY in the mood for some Indian food and (thankfully) my boyfriend has begun to appreciate it more and more so we decided to try a new place. I had only been to 2 or 3 other restaurants in the Valley since I moved here and I thought I had found my go-to...well, turns out, I have a new one. 

We learned that this was a new location for the business, that they had moved recently from a location they had been in for years. We thought it was decent, well decorated, we were comfortable there. It was really slow and we wondered why, but whatever - better service for us eh?

And it was! Besides the food being SPOT ON - the service was so attentive, personal and friendly we not only had our tummys warmed by the culinary loving but also our spirits by just having some nice conversation with our server (whom we didn't get her name but she had just moved to Phoenix from Flagstaff where she worked for their location there which we are definitely making note to try next time we go up North!). 

For our visit, we stuck with some of my usual Indian faves - Shrimp Curry (medium heat) w/ Garlic Naan and Basmati rice and then the MIXED TANDOORI GRILL (OMG, best I have had, served on a sizzling plate with vegetables and onions, tender and not dry). We had a little RICE PUDDING with some INDIAN TEA to finish which was a perfect combination. 

(Sorry, I CAPITALIZE the food I had/recommend for the skim-readers.)

We cannot wait to go back and bring some other family and friends who want to try Indian food, probably try the buffet!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Indian food, service can be slow, the buffet is pretty good as well. It has gotten really expensive over the years all things considered. The neighborhood is a little bit strange too so make sure you lock your car doors."}
{"text":"One of the best indian resturants I have been, the food here was really amazing.  
Good ambiance 
Great food 
Wonderful service 
Overall amazing experience !!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with Justin G. because we had eaten at Mint like the previous week and wanted to try something different. If you've eaten at everything around UNLV, you get tired of it so we were off. 

The restaurant is in a shady area of town yet it's the only nice building so it's fine I guess. We were one of two groups of people in the place, apart from a table of servers which was weird, because it was lunch time. 

Overall, the food is good. Their goat isn't as good as Mint's but I still ate like a billion plates of it because it was still really tasty. Some of the breaded veggies were a little chewy but I assume that's because there wasn't a crowd there to eat up the food and have it rotated. They had some awesome naan.

I got a free mango lassi with a Yelp check in. Justin checked in too but they wouldn't give him one because it was one per table, rather than one per check. It wasn't a big deal because it was (delicious) and big enough to share. 

The reason this gets 3 stars instead of 4 was because when Justin asked for the check, we somehow were charged for a different table and it came out to more than $40 for two buffets. Justin said that his card had been charged for the wrong amount and that they needed to void the transaction. They told him that they couldn't give him a void slip and that they ran the card for the correct amount. He argued with them about now paying $60+ dollars for two buffets when the server threw the receipts in his lap, told him to call his credit card and dispute it and walked away in frustration. I went to sit out in the car while Justin tried to fix it. Super uncomfortable. 

Justin called his card and made sure he was only charged the correct amount. The food was good but the way the meal ended, I don't know if I'd go back."}
{"text":"I'd love to give India Palace 5 stars but the food isn't always consistent. Some days it's a 2 and other days it's some of the best in the Valley. We typically order the samosas, garlic naan and chicken tikka masala."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find that the food is even better on the weekend. 8.99 for the lunch buffet was already a great quality for what I received during my previous visits, but they stepped up their game food-wise on this fine Sunday. This gives such a great value. They were extremely busy and were having trouble attending to water and naan refills, but the management apologized and told me how much they value me as a guest. That rarely happens. Way to go, India Palace!"}
{"text":"Great Service by Vick, food is always fantastic. Vicks food and drink selections were spot on. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Checked out India Palace with my boyfriend and was way less than thrilled. Arrived to a mostly empty restaurant (they had maybe 3-4 tables of people). It took a minute for anyone to greet us and then seat us. We were seated at a booth (which was showing quite a bit of wear & tear on the seats... the vinyl/leather was cracking) and given menus and then the host walked away. Our server came by and we ordered papadums and onion bhaji to start. 

The restaurant is located off the strip and was pretty easy to find. They didn't seem to put a whole lot of effort into decor, but they have a couple TVs set up. In the back of the seating area, they had a buffet area set up, but I'm guessing its only a lunch buffet because there was nothing out when we went for dinner. It did look pretty sizable though. 

They brought out our onion bhaji, which was alright but definitely not good or great. No papadums. We ordered 1 garlic naan and 1 cheese naan and our meals...I got chicken tikka masala and my boyfriend got tandoori chicken, asking again for papadums. So the server brought out 2 orders of garlic naan but no cheese naan. My tikka masala was not good and ended up making me sick. My boyfriend's tandoori chicken was over cooked & dried out. And still no papadums. I asked AGAIN for papadums and our server finally told us they don't have papadums, even though they have them on their menu. 

Between the awful service and the OK (which is generous of me), I'm not impressed with this place. I won't be back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food, very inpressed, and I'm from New York, the home of \"supposedly\" authentic Indian cuisine. Delicious garlic naan, and all the other dishes we tried. No complaints, thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is a BOMB!!!! Their food is 1000000 times better than those hotel buffet costing $$$. It has a great collection of legitimate Indian foods ranging from South to North India. And we got a deal on living social ($30 for $15) plus free mango lassi on Yelp. What a dope deal!!!! If you want to save money on food and party more, this is a place to go!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to have indian food. I've been coming here for years. I live their paneer masala and malai kofta. My husband loves the garlic naan bread, chilli chicken and keema mattar."}
{"text":"Ordered here for the first time and we had madras lamb at least that's what we ordered... Anyways it was take out so I guess they messed up our order and gave us beef instead of lamb. I really wanted to like the place since it had such good reviews but the taste just wasn't to my liking. This could have been due to the disappointment of eating beef instead of lamb, but the madras just didn't have the same balance between the spiciness and the coconut that I've tasted at other restaurants. The naan bread was the only plus."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while and it is always wonderful! Staff are very friendly and helpful and the food is fantastic. I highly recommend dining in. The onion parantha fresh out of the oven gives me inappropriate thoughts. This is our Indian go-to for sure. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Having lived in both southern and northern California, I found the food to be good but not great.  4 stars because I know how crappy the other Indian food in Vegas is.  3 stars because the service was not very good, and the manager argued with me about the bill after I claimed 2 separate Yelp offers (neither claimed they had to be used exclusively, and they took the order with no issue when I showed them the offers I was planning on using).  The daals were the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"We have been going to India Palace for about 6 years. The food has always been good whether it's the lunch buffet or dinner. However, they consistantly have the worst service of any restaurant I've been to anywhere. It is almost like customers are an inconvenience for them. If you can get anyone's attention it's a feat as they all disappear into the kitchen and never come out. I'm giving 4 stars because of the service, the food is really good so maybe I'll  just try takeout next time."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I ever tasted so far in Las Vegas! Sorry ate the food before I could snap a photo."}
{"text":"The food was alright. I went in for lunch buffet. Service was great but food not so much. Being an indian i guess i am more aware of the flavors and thats exactly what was missing. Desserts were terrible their gulab jamun was hard as a rock and the kheer was missing its main ingredient SUGAR. I give this an average go."}
{"text":"MMMM has a great buffet all you can eat buffet for lunch for a good price. It's Monday through Sunday. They have just remodeled so there's a bar added to it as well as a larger area to sit."}
{"text":"Nice decor and very clean. The servers need to take some training on etiquette, but they didn't mean bad. The chicken tikka masala was tasty for sure but a small portion for the money. Goat biryami was bad . Gulab jun was yummy."}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch buffet with my friend. Initially I was disappointed there is no huge range of items. But trust me what ever they had are best. It's one of the best buffets had in recent past."}
{"text":"Excellent meal!
Clean restaurant and the service is 5 Star!

We started with the Bombay Fish and Garlic Naan for appetizer. So tasty, and just the right amount of flavor.
For entrees we ordered the Goat Curry, Lamb Pasanda and a side of rice.
Absolutely delicious! the only place in town who knows how to cook the Goat just right. The sauce on both entrees was heavenly! 

I have been here a few times, and it is always delicious. Even their lunch buffet is fun to go to.

If you like good Indian food, I highly recommend!

Thank you India Palace for always giving excellent service and fabulous food!"}
{"text":"Great place!!! Chicken tikka masala is one of the best I've ever had!! 
Great service and nice and clean!!
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I go for the buffet and it's always a wide selection of food. Love the chicken makhni and the fresh hot naan! Lassi was a Lil on the sweet side."}
{"text":"My brother found this restaurant, asking local folks where they went for Indian food.  Certainly the outside of it would never have attracted us!

But ooooh, the food!  The lamb curry was good, the chicken vindaloo was delish, and the goat curry (yes, goat curry) was to die for.  Service was swift and friendly.  The decor was odd -- a cross between New Delhi and someone's living room -- but that went weirdly well with the sense that this was, in fact, some fabulous home cooking."}
{"text":"Better avoid. Worst restaurant in Phoenix. Last I ordered chily chicken and they gave chicken curry. Chicken biryani was very bad."}
{"text":"Was craving buffet but the asian ones in the area are horrible. Never really had Indian food so I thought I would try it. The buffet didn't look appetizing at all but I felt bad leaving so I thought I would suck it up and just try it. 

To be honest I don't know the names of any of the things I tried lol the chicken with the red sauce over rice was really good. The tikka chicken? Something like that.

Tiny buffet with very limited selections. They had the Indian names of the foods but to someone who doesn't know, that means nothing. I think putting an English description would definitely help.

The dessert which was little dough balls or some sort covered in syrup was good. Something different.

Truth be told, had I known ahead of time what the buffet consisted of, I probably wouldn't have come. But the food turned out to be good and the staff was very nice.

I do have to add that their tap water was actually pretty good! Which is rare when it comes to restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"We've come here quite a few times for both dinner a la carte and for the lunch buffet.   It's my bfs favorite Indian food place in Las Vegas.   I think it is slowly coming to be mine as well.   

The service is great.   We never have to ask for more water and someone always stops by to check on us.  This is especially good for lunch time when you want more garlic naan. 

The food is very consistent and always tastes good.   Everything comes to you hot and spiced just to your liking. 

Last night was the first time I'd gotten take out  (from yelp! ) and it was just as good as dining in.   I got there early and sat at the bar.  The service is so great they made sure I was ok and didn't need a water or something. 

The food was also just as good as dining in.   Obviously things that are fried and the naan don't travel that well but everything else was spot on.

I absolutely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I've never been to India, so this place will have to do. It's a lot closer and let's face it, I wouldn't be able to speak their language anyways. I could always go to India and try to speak English to the natives, but I doubt they'd understand me. It's not like they've ever been colonized by an English-speaking country or anything.

There are many TVs here that constantly play Indian shows and music videos. It really adds to the atmosphere and gives insight as to what their culture is like. As a growing expert in Indian history I have a great appreciation for such things, but I find that I disagree with many of their principles. Gandhi may have advocated a non-violent approach, but I'm glad they slaughtered the animals to bring me my chicken tikka masala.

The Naan breads, both garlic and normal-flavored, are especially appetizing. I often have these dreams in which the naan bread speaks to me and reminds me of how great it tastes. This usually occurs on Saturday nights because on Sundays I go here for lunch. My friend likes to wash down his meal with a cup of fresh chai tea, but I don't quite like the taste. It just doesn't speak to me the same way the naan does.

I usually come here for the buffet. The lunch buffet is $10, which is a little less than what I paid for the toilet plunger I used following this meal. Yes, eating exotic cuisine can be painful sometimes, but don't get me wrong; there's nothing bad about the food here. It's always prepared well and tastes authentic. But spicy food going in is still spicy food going out.

--------------------

The food here is great and I come here twice a month. Highly recommend!

Cheeeeeeeeeeeers"}
{"text":"Delicious food! They had all my favorites available at the lunch buffet. Service was great, food was great, and beautifully decorated interior. The only thing keeping my rating from a 5 star was that the food at the buffet tables isn't kept warm enough. By the time you get back to your table and grab a quick few sips of your drink, the food is no longer warm. Other than that my experience was perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm very new to indian food.  Sure, I've been to the occassional business meeting or friend's house where chicken tikka was served, but never on my own.  I asked the server, Paul, for a recommendation.  He suggested chicken korma based off of my other likes.  It was great.  Add basmati rice and garlic naan, perfect.  Everyone was nice and attentive.  This is going onto my weekly cravings next to my favorite panang place.  Well done, guys.  And a soecial shout out to Josh and Sonny for remembering my friend from a lunch a couple of days before."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I got the Tandoori Chicken with the medium spiciness which was perfect.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and the flavor was really, really mouthwatering good.  I also got the Basmati Rice, which was perfect as well. The cheese naan was worth it as well, very soft and fresh with great flavor.  I love the mint sauce that came along with it and the brown sauce was excellent as well.  I will come back the next time I'm in Vegas for business, I ate a bunch of high-end high-rated food in the resorts while I was here and this is what stood out the most.  I'm partial to this kind of stuff, though, but ultimately I'd love to try many other things on their menu after the awesome flavor and great quality of the food I had here this evening."}
{"text":"Last night in Vegas:

My girlfriend and I wanted to eat somewhere off the strip and have some good Indian food. We are both glad we found this place. Ok it may not be in the best part of town, but the food more than makes up for it.

Appetizers: Complimentary flat breads with dipping sauces

Entrees: Lamb Curry & Chicken Tikka Masala

Sides: Keemon Naan and Plain Naan.

Everything was oh so good. I don't really eat too much indian food, maybe because I'm worried that I'm going to get bad indian food. But I'm glad we went here. First thing you notice when you walk in, is that everyone that is sitting in the restaurant is indian! Ok, so they're all indian this place must be good! And YES it was. For sure we are going to have to go back here again if and when we are in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Las Vegas!!!! Excellent service and a lot of variety!!! Brilliant taste...everyone should definitely dine here!!!"}
{"text":"We have been following and eating at this restaurant for 15 years. It is the best Indian restaurant. Food flavor is just right, not greasy. We love the naan here too."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, the prices are not so pretty good. Plus you have to pay for rice which I think is a complete sham especially when you're already shelling out ~$15 for a curry. I mean come on, how much is rice? Definitely not the $3.95 you charged me.

Anyway, we were a group of 4 so we got a decent variety: Saag Paneer, Haryali Chicken, Karahi Chicken, and I convinced my bro-in-law to try goat so we also got the Goat Curry. The Goat Curry sauce was pretty tasty but all the goat meat was attached to chunks of bone so it's a bit of a pain and not so fun to have to extract actual meat. Goat is nearer to pork than anything if you've never tried it by the way - & not gamey like mutton can be...barf.

Karahi Chicken was also worthy of getting. A nice tasting curry with various spices intermingling. I had mine done \"spicy\" but it still could have used a little more heat. 

I wish I could tell you about the Haryali Chicken but my soon-to-be sister-in-law didn't seem to want to share from the other side of the table. It looked good. 

Check Groupon or Yelp for deals here. And get the garlic naan and paratha to round out your experience."}
{"text":"Good Indian food buffet for lunch. Food is a bit above average compared to similar places in the valley. Spiciness was good for me (mild-medium) but the food wasn't as flavorful as I'd expect for Indian food. Some of the vegetarian dishes and naan were bland. 
My favorites were the chicken curry and the paneer based dishes - they had enough spiceness and spice for my indian food fix. 

Also, staff is friendly and they have rice pudding - so I'm sure I'll be back. 

Just a quick note though - the sign from the street says \"Cuisine of India\" - not \"India Palace\" but it's still the right place. Just look for the Good Egg."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, but I had lunch there today at their buffet. It was one of the most delicious Indian meals I have ever had. I love their iced tea too, it was strong and delicious.  Every single dish I tried at the buffet, and there must have been a dozen or 10 at least, was fantastic. 

I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Super fireeeee. One of the best spots for chicken tikka masala I've ever had. And the saag paneer. It was like an orgasm in my mouth every time. Lol okay just trying to give you a visual so you'll come try it. My sister and I have lived in Vegas well myself 3 years her more than 10. We pass this place all the time. This time we were finally just like let's go they got good reviews. We were not disappointed. Jaga was a fantastic server. The garlic naan too! Oh you gotta get the garlic naan. Gahhhhhhhh okay I'm done bye"}
{"text":"Great food with authentic taste, and at very reasonable price.
Not very far from the strip.."}
{"text":"I ate at the buffet and every dish had a flavor that was slightly different and off from what I was expecting and wanted."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurant in Vegas. We tried paneer tikka masala and tarka dal (tip - go for double tarka if you like spicy). Looking forward to visit this place again."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas.
Their chicken tikka masala is excellent and their naan bread is delicious."}
{"text":"Hip location and atmosphere, and the food was above average as well.  Veggie pakoras were outstanding, and I loved the red chili chutney that is served alongside the mint and tamarind.  Northern Indian entrees were rather good, but the Dosai were very average.  Sambar was watery and low in flavor."}
{"text":"I'd give this more of a 3.5.  It's Las Vegas, so I guess you should expect to pay Las Vegas prices.  I've had dosas in California and in Asia, and would give this a 7/10 for flavor (that's why we came to this restaurant- for the paper dosas.  We also had the malai kofta, and that was better: 8/10.  Naan was solid and so was the basmati rice.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Well, I had tried Origin India, Tamba, Bollywood Grill, and India Oven. 
None of them compare to the tastes of India Palace that I experienced in Oct 2009. Everything tasted great, from the mango lassi to the chicken tikka masala.
The only negative was that the waiter's Indian accent was very thick and he tended to speak quickly, so he wasn't always easy to understand - even for a well traveled person like myself. 
Still, I'm yet to find a better Indian restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is delicious. The service is friendly. The restaurant is clean, comforting and the videos on the television are fun and entertaining. :-) 

I usually avoid lunch buffet places, in this case I encourage it, especially if you are new to Indian food. The buffet today had biryani rice in addition to a wide selection of vegetable dishes, meat curries, tikka, tandoori chicken and lamb. They offer salads, chutneys  and the best naan I have ever tried to accompany your meal. They also offer delicious desserts.  Try the rice pudding (kheer) and the gulab jamun (sweet fried cheese balls in syrup)  

My favorite vegetable dishes: kofta, dal and yogurt masala. My husband a son in law both approved the lamb curry and chicken dishes.

This place makes the herbivores and the carnivores in my family very happy.  I want to try their dosas next!  

Great atmosphere. Nice family operation including two very well behaved children on summer break in the booth next to us. Love this place. Go see them!!"}
{"text":"This place had yummy food and good service however their portions are small. We had to order an extra chicken Tikka masala to help fill our tummies and it's $15 for such a small portion. Garlic naan was awesome:)"}
{"text":"3 stars for good service. the staff were friendly and polite. however, when it comes to food, they are a bit lacking. we went here for the lunch buffet. the buffet costs $9.99 which is not bad for the price but only has limited choices.  i liked the spinach dish, korma vegetable, and their naan. otherwise, they could do better adding a bit more taste on the other dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout chicken saagwala- sooo good! $14 for a nice portion (rice was separate but a huge order.) saag was creamy with tender chunks of chicken. I like spicy Indian food (but can't take it too hot) so the \"regular\" intensity was perfect. One of the most savory versions I've tried - if they were walkable it would have been 5 stars"}
{"text":"Consistently great chicken tikka masala, Peas Pulau and homemade garlic Naan!  We live on the opposite side of town and drive the distance for this food... it's the type of really good food that you crave!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. I have tried many others, but India Palace has consistently the best food. The new decor is a plus, too. Favorite items include Shrimp Biryani, Vegetable Samosas, Dal Makani, Aloo Gobi, Tandoori Chicken, and Garlic Naan. They also have the best Tamarind Sauce."}
{"text":"Our favorite Indian food in Las Vegas - near the Strip and UNLV campus. Sure, it's kind of in a sketch area, but the building is nice - and once inside, the decor and food are just great. They play bollywood movies or clips on the tvs and it's fun to watch while waiting for our food. 

Tonight our party of 4 was really hungry so we ordered our staples: vegetable samosas (2 for $4.50), garlic naan, basmati rice, matar paneer ($12.95); and 3 dishes we haven't had before: House Special Lamb Rogan Josh ($15.95), full Tandoori Chicken ($20), and Chicken Vindaloo ($14.95). 

We're wimps so everything was \"mild\" spicy but still very flavorful and delicious, with plenty of leftovers to take home. I like to try different things on the menu each time we're here, but would definitely order the Lamb dish again - fantastic flavor and tender!! I only wish I had room for dessert when I eat here!

 I always come here with a coupon to make the meal an even better deal (ended up being $21/person including tax) and the waiter always have to be reminded to take the discount. But I've always had good attentive service and great food here and that's why we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I visited India Palace when i came on an official trip to Las vegas. I ordered Paneer tikka masala and roti.Both were made with perfection. Tikka masala was their house special. It tasted great without so much cream( how they usually make in other indian restaurants). Roti was made in tandoor and it looked little burnt, but it was actually soft and good to eat. The ambience was warm and neat. The staffs were really friendly and very welcoming. Totally, i had a good experience with India Palace. I would surely visit again for tikka masala!!"}
{"text":"This place has authentic Indian food. I had ordered (take-out) Garlic Naan, Alu Kurma, Paneer Tikka, and Dal. All dishes were excellent. I had asked for \"spicy\" and I wasn't disappointed. The food had some kick but it was the good kind. At some restaurants, you get an extra sprinkle of chilli powder/paste if you ask for \"hot\" but this place actually integrated the spiciness into the food very well. I live in the bay area with a hundred options for vegetarian Indian food but this place has been quite a standout. 

The service was also excellent, and that's why I don't have any hesitation to give it a 5 star rating. The order-taking lady was pleasant over the phone, they accommodated different spice levels and slight customization (I had asked for \"gingery\" dal : - ) ), and they provided some take out plates and plastic cutlery. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was excellent. Good variety both meat and vegetarian. Brought choice of warm bread to table as well. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very questionnable service here.  Our server kept sniffling the whole time he served us in a very obvious way.  If you are sick, you should NOT be serving customers food!!  I had to mentally block images of him sneezing into our food before he came out of the kitchen.  

We wanted to order a bottle of wine that would complement the spicy dishes that we ordered and asked for recommendations.  However, our server had absolutely no knowledge of their wine list and told us that every bottle was a merlot. Riight....  

Food here was reasonably good and fresh but their butter chicken tasted a bit artificially sweet.  You can't beat the price though as for 5 people each ordering a main dish + wine, it came out to $27 including tax & tip."}
{"text":"Food is bad and location didn't seem very nice. Beware of automatic gratuity which is charged when you have six people even if some of the guests are little kids."}
{"text":"We had visited the place during 4th July weekend. Right as we stepped in, we felt that the host was non-welcoming. The lunch buffet didn't really have enough options if you were a vegetarian. So we ordered a la carte. The curries were ordinary, and surprisingly even the breads weren't good. What we were most dissatisfied with, was their service - sloppy to say the best."}
{"text":"Customer service at it's worst. 
I don't think these people working here know what service means. The receipt for my to-go order was literally thrown at me. I understand that customer service cannot be at its best during peak hours but the restaurant was not even half full. I would never recommend this place for a pleasant day out..."}
{"text":"I've been eating here regularly for a few months now and I absolutely love it! The food here (I've tried quite a few dishes) is phenomenal! Some of the best I've ever had. The staff are welcoming and it's a nice quiet atmosphere, at least when I've gone. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try some authentic, delicious Indian food."}
{"text":"Same old same old . Nothing new. Ok looking place. Below par with hygiene compared to American dining places. Looks like a dingy bar. Food is ok nothing great for 4 star reviews."}
{"text":"Good punjabi food. Fresh tasting and just the right amount of spices. Yellow dal tadka, panner bhurji and palak paneer were excellent.  Very friendly staff ."}
{"text":"My go-to place in Vegas for Indian food. Staff is exceptional and very accommodating to my food allergies. I feel safe eating here. Try ordering a hot tea or coffee with the spicy foods and it will set off the delicate flavors and take it to a whole new level. You can also order items with less spice. Btw their coffee is good and VERY strong!"}
{"text":"1 star for free mango lassi thru yelp checkin. 
Below average food, uncleaned plates and glasses. Bad service. No water was given for the first round of buffet had to ask for it.  Very unhappy not recommended. THe guy with specs at the bar has a very bad attitude."}
{"text":"Personable and lovely staff.  Food is amazing!  I wish I could give it a thousand stars.... found my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered a bunch of Biryanis and Utappams. And a vegetarian Dinner plate. Food taste was good enough for the biryanis and dinner. Not so good for the other south indian dishes.But the most surprising thing was an \" Automatic Gratuity\" !!
We as customers can be suggested amounts for tips, but not charged automatically from the amount !!
for a bill of 138.5$ were charged an \"automatic grauity\" of 25$. Thats 18%."}
