{"text":"The food is okay ( I use to life in southern CA)  but the prices were crazy, it's is so OVERPRICED"}
{"text":"Trying to think of something positive to start with. Ya, there's nothing.  First, they were out of lemons AND limes...yet they were still serving Margaritas. Go figure!  The enchiladas were undercooked. The server (Cody) was friendly & knowledgeable, but the service was unforgivably slow.   Save yourself the frustration by abounding this place."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. The hostesses were rude and didn't tell us our wait would be extended. Once we were finally seated our waitress didn't come for 5-10 minutes. She was not very on top of things, she didn't come and re-fill water. The guacamole on a cart was disgusting, it was brown and some avocados were moldy. Finally we received our entrees and it was nasty and tasted like Taco Bell. If I wanted $9 tacos I would have gone to Barrio. If I wanted tacos that tasted like that I would have gone to Taco Bell. It overall was horrible and I will never be returning."}
{"text":"This was a poor dining experience.  The place was dirty, the service was slow, and the waitress didn't seem to care.  I will avoid eating here ever again!"}
{"text":"Besides the table side guac - I don't have anything good to say about this restaurant. We waited well over 30 minutes for a seat (2 people) and I counted at least 20 open seats at tables they apparently were not seating. We arrived just after happy hour ended and the margs while tasty were way to small for the price they were charging. The table side guac was well done and made to your tasting but the tacos were thrown together poorly and were just mediocre. My wife and I love Mexican and are pretty easy to please but unless I have a meeting or reason to be in Solon we will not be making a special trip back."}
{"text":"Paco's is a very cute place and they have a fantastic staff. I love how clean it is and the food is amazing. The salmon salad is to die for! Plus they do happy hour and they have a great deal on tacos! Love it."}
{"text":"While service was good, we did notice a lot of servers and staff crowding around the door. It was a bit overwhelming when you walk into a restaurant for the first time with 10 staff members staring at you.   This is not the place for vegetarians, their black bean tacos were almost inedible. I've heard they changed it around, but I still don't see myself returning.  The sugar skull decor is fascinating."}
{"text":"The owner might consider looking at the Menu from Los Fuentes Mexican Restaurant ln Los Angeles. A 50 year establishment with the greatest Mexican Food.   Perhaps a trip to California to update the menu would help.    The beef taco I had at Pacos was more americanized (it tasted like it was prepped with a grocery store  taco packet ) than what you would find at a true Mexican restaurant.  The chips were good as we're the rice and besns. The salsa did not taste fresh roasted nor prepped from fresh tomatoes. It lacked spice.....  Lovely restaurant but you have to tweet the food.a bit.."}
{"text":"When we arrived we were told there'd be a thirty minute wait even though there were 7 or 8 empty tables (maybe reservations?). We decided to sit at the bar instead. That proved to be a great choice. Drinks were good-margarita flight perfect for those who want to try different drinks, bartenders were fast and friendly, food came quickly. Wife had Baja chicken tacos and I ordered Pacos Nachos. Both were great but nachos such a large portion that we easily could have shared just those and still had leftovers. All in all its a great new place. I highly recommend you either make a reservation or sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Just got back from my family and my first visit to Pacos Tacos.  We got there between 3:30 - 4:00 on a Saturday and were seated by the open wall area.  House margaritas were very good, the $11 shrimp appetizers were totally not worth it and our tacos (though small as many people mentioned) were pretty good.  We had to wait a long time for our tacos to show up and we made it through two and a half bags of chips during the wait.  (We all liked the chips and salsa (and we were hungry!))  The tacos were $6 for two (mix or match) and the margaritas were $5 each during the happy hour that runs 3 - 6 daily. All in all, a decent place to go and we will probably be back at some point in time."}
{"text":"Run for the border... The service is less than spectacular and the food is just OK. Given the success of the Burntwood restaurants I would have expected Pacos to be much better.  The floors are dangerously slippery!"}
{"text":"Meh. Food was bland,  menu was boring. Our waiter acted like we were the rudest for asking for more water. I'm pretty sure he heavily set a glass down on the table after filling it. I mean,  that was after we had to go to the bar to ask for refills and interrupt him from sitting down at a table with friends."}
{"text":"This was our 4th visit.  Each time food was good but service was bad.  This last time we all ordered waters but they ran out of glasses so we had to wait at least 20 mins and it was only 6:30 pm on Saturday.  They recently changed their menu. The tacos I ordered were bland and the side of rice and beans that use to come with them is now a la carte.   Waitress was not very friendly."}
{"text":"Planned on coming here for birthday dinner.  Looks like a nice place.  Checked in and was told wait was 20 minutes. After 35 minutes went back to check and asked how long and they said maybe another 30 minutes. I understand that tables need to empty to sit new customers but there were a number of tables sitting empty already. Plus after  looking at several reviews we decided to cut our losses and go to another restaurant where we know the food and service is excellent. Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Had tacos and chips.  Service was bad.  Server made it seem like we were bothering her.  This was the second time there and very similar experiences both times.  Wanted to give it another try as I like the look and feel of the place but don't be fooled.  The food is just ok and the service is horrid.  Your best bet is to go sit at the bar and order food there and bypass the servers.  Was hoping for much more the second time but left disappointed."}
{"text":"I think this place is centered around their bar. Food was mediocre and took along time to come out considering Mexican food. Bare walls and ceiling make for a loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went last week on a Saturday night.  The wait was not bad and the guac was of course good.  That's about where it ends.  The service was awful. We had to ask for everything (napkins, water, forks).  When we could manage to get the server to bring us water, we got it in little rocks glasses. That wouldn't have been so bad if I knew we would see her again any time soon.  I tried to order more margaritas a few times but couldn't manage to get her to bring me more drinks, isn't that how restaurants make money?   I won't go back any time soon which is too bad.  I love Mexican food."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive. Great location, really nice decor, and the chips are great. We ordered the guac prepared tableside and the gentleman who made it was fantastic. As for the rest, menu is limited but in fairness it's online so you know that going into it. Prices were reasonable and drink selection is great, if they are not out of various drink mixes. We tried to order a couple of drinks and dinner items only to find out they were unavailable. Service was atrocious, everyone we encountered (guac guy aside) was rude and appeared annoyed. We were there for 90 minutes plus until our food came. Food taste was nothing unique, almost Chipotleish. Big disappointment for a place that was really hyped up."}
{"text":"My tacos (duck and lamb) were significantly smaller than the pictures of others and about two bites each versus at a separate seating time, my son said his lobster tacos were three bites each but delicious.  Wait staff is young and inexperienced. Hope it all improves."}
{"text":"The tacos were excellent and the corn cakes are heavenly. Above all, they serve the best tortilla chips and salsa, I've ever had in a restaurant. I liked that there were so many choices. I ordered the American, the chicken Tinga and the Barbacoa tacos. All three were delicious. I was happy with the service and thought that the size of the tacos and the price were just fine. I plan to come here often."}
{"text":"Wanted to love it because I like the decor and the location is great. They need to improve the food. I had chicken burritos and there was little chicken and dry crunchy rice. The wait staff was great. My companion had tacos and said there were dry also. With a few culinary improvements they would be great. It appeared they trying for a fancy taco experience and it wasn't a good fit.  New review a year later....much better food. Had the happy hour and the chicken taco Tinga. Much improved!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience for a new place in town. Came with kids, waited way too long for a drink and for the casual kind of food. The waitress was not paying attention at all. How can you get the kids tacos wrong? The food was average. Tacos size was too small but maybe it's ok for $10. Overall, it seems too much effort went into decor and not enough into training staff and getting place organized. Why bother opening a restaurant if cannot provide a decent service? I don't care about the looks and don't expect fine cuisine. But please improve your service!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed oir evening at Pacos Tacos! Was excited to try the new place and it lived up to my expectations. The table side guac was delicious. We got spice in it and ended up being phenonomenal. Living in Mexico for 6 months so I had some fare share of great guac and this guac was top notch! Pacos nachos were a feast themselves. The table of 4 we had barely put a dent in them!   I got the pork belly tacos and my wife got the fish tacos. Pork belly tacos were out this world! Especially love their hand made tortillas. Price point is good when you consider they are making them in house.   Desserts we got the fried ice cream and churros.both excellent.   It was a fun experience, will definitly be back!"}
{"text":"THIS IS A PLACE YOU WANT TO LIKE. MAYBE I DO. BUT NOT FOR THE FOOD. SORRY TO BE YELLING, but it is SO DAMN LOUD IN HERE!  I can hardly taste the food.   First the drinks. Happy hour $2 draft Corona is a good deal, if you drink Corona. Everybody does, it seems. Except for being brewed in St Louis by the biggest beer brewer in the world, I can't think of any other reason to drink it. Spouse says her margarita is good. Not fantastic. Good. Eldest child says her watermelon margarita was good. \"Not the best I ever had\" is the exact quote. Funny, they are old enough the drink. Much less REVIEW A DRINK.   TABLESIDE GUACAMOLE (oh sorry. I'll use my indoor voice) is a cool feature. But less than perfect; avocado and too much lime made it less cool. I know how hard it must be to find 300 dozen ripe avocados. In Ohio.   Carnitas tacos had spice but no other flavor standing out. And too oily. Youngest child, a vegetarian, said black bean tacos had flavors of an appetizer, not an entree. Too sweet to eat. A good salsa, not a taco. This is the accountant child, so she recognizes good value. Quote: \"I wouldn't pay for them\". Did I say she is smart too? Cause I was paying for the meal.   My grilled fish tacos were fresh, lemony, tart. Just like last time. But small. I have an issue with food invented by peasants now reduced in size and increased in cost. If you want traditional Mexican dishes, not here. Spouse says even the music doesn't match the food. It's more of a Mexican-Czech -American -hipster. Go to Barrio. They do that better.  Best feature is the outstanding service. Quick, polite and go the extra distance. Youngest child has a nut allergy, and the hostess and waitress handled that with confidence.  Go here to be seen at happy hour. Whatever being \"seen\" in Solon Ohio gets you. But I'm still in search of good Mexican food in Ohio."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight at 10:00.  Experience was underwhelming at best.  Food was not good and definitely did not live up to the marketing. Ordered carne asada tacos.  They came cold.  Aside from some chewy beef, nothing else from the menu description was there.  It was bland and tasteless.  There were no jalapeños as described.  There was a mystery cream sauce/ crema on these tacos that was not shown on the menu for this dish but was shown as part of the description for carnitas, that made me ill.    Restaurants that are too arrogant or presumptuous to put salt and pepper on the table and then serve food that needs salt are not worth visiting.  I asked for a  bottle of hot sauce to try to add a little flavor to the food and they brought me a one oz cup of something that tasted like hot barbecue sauce.  A bottle of Cholula would have been better.  Table side guacamole needed more onion, salt, pepper, cilantro, and peppers.  It was tasteless.  The guy making it was pleasant.  Service was average or below.  Waitress ignored us a lot to talk to other tables.  She disappeared at check time."}
{"text":"Much like its sister restaurant, Burntwood Tavern, most of the creativity is spent on the decor, not the menu."}
{"text":"I tried it on 8/8 for lunch.  I love the decor and atmosphere.   Hard to tell what the place looked like prior to the renovations.   The pork taco was a joke I love tacos and the burntwood group and have always recommended them.  Sorry guys but u missed on this one with respect to food.  Portion size was insulting.  What little pork I had was too tough to chew.  The beans / rice were a good garnish.    Service was slow I watched other tables get food before my group of two.    Come on guys you can do better than this!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago and must say that I was quite dissapointed with the place.  The taco shells have too much of a starchy texture that makes them fall apart very easily, which would be okay, except they taste very starchy as well. I couldn't really tell whether the meat inside the taco tasted good or not because the shell's starchy corn flavoring was so overpowering.  Service was slow and food was very expensive for a small amount.  They get two stars instead of one because they have improved the atmosphere from the former Applebee's, but I think they should look into a new tortilla recipe and make the tacos taste coincide with the price."}
{"text":"We came in for a late lunch. We started with the lobster quesadilla and shared a burrito for an entree.   Service was friendly and attentive. However we were very unimpressed with the food. Quesadilla was very bland. It lacked salt and flavor. The burrito was just terrible. Dry tortilla, lots of rice and under seasoned.   Also I cannot help but note that a group of managers and staff were having a meeting/eating lunch a few tables away from us. It was very disruptive to our meal and altered the energy of the area.   We live close but I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"I thought that the guacamole table was dirty. Good idea, but eh. Cute decor. Food was ok. I will try something else next time."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Came here for desserts and drinks. The margarita sampler wasn't bad but the fried ice cream had no taste and the brownie was mediocre at best. The floor was wet and it took several minutes to be seated.   The server was super friendly and helpful with my wife's gluten allergy but outside of that it was a forgettable experience. I highly doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced small portions. All metal ceiling. Sound bounces like a ping pong ball LOUD If you are looking for a full Mexican menu this is not the place. Will try again In a few months to see if quality and portions improve."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to!  The food is awful!!!!  Chips were soggy.  Salsa and guacamole are awful!  Tacos are awful!  The only thing that was good was the bottle of wine - all they had to do was to open it and therefore couldn't destroy the flavors.  But what should one expect from the owners of Burntwood Tavern and M Italian?  Awful food everywhere further dumbing down the palates of Clevelanders!  Shame on you for serving such awful food!  Shame on Clevelanders for allowing it to happen!  Three strikes and you're out!"}
{"text":"One star for the ceviche, which was pretty much the only edible item on the menu. How you can screw up tacos this badly is beyond comprehension. Flavor profiles on the menu read interesting, but execution is heavy handed and poorly balanced at best. Margaritas are allegedly \"classic,\" yet all feature triple sec, so no, that's not how the cocktail is made. No tequila list. No flights. Beer tap system was completely down when we visited. Wine by the glass ranged from days old to just opened, both wrong temperature. Service was poor to atrocious. Oh... The décor was nice."}
{"text":"After reading what people said I had to write my first review.     This place is my current obsession!!   And  I'm no newbie to Mexican food- most especially margaritas.   In fact I am on the quest for the perfect margarita in the world.   Yes I ask for a margarita ( and discuss the same with the server and/ or bartender - fair warning) everywhere I travel.    I have had margaritas in Mexico, South America, across the U.S.in Europe and the Mediterranean .   I could eat ( and drink) Mexican everyday (yes I like pizza Chinese and sushi too)  but this is my place.    It takes more than one visit to perfect what u like (chipotle took a few visits for me to figure it out-now yum).     This place rocks!   The bartenders and kitchen will modify anything you want.   The happy hour (3 to 6 EVERY day!!!) is amazing and unparalleled.  There is a little bit of fun (free face painting on day of the dead).    I gotta say I have nothing critical to say (don't forget we live in the real world where people take time to complain more than take the time to say anything nice).   Live.  Eat.  Have fun. Life is short .  I hope they are around for a long long time   Ps I just checked yelp and I have been to 17 of the top 18 local Mexican places..."}
{"text":"My husband, brother-in-law and I dined at Pacos Tacos over the weekend. I've been there a handful of times before but never to eat a full meal - typically just chips+salsa and appetizers or happy hour. I ordered the rotisserie chicken cobb salad. I didn't taste the \"cider vinaigrette\" dressing it comes with and the rotisserie chicken seemed old and dry. My husband ordered a few tacos including the americano and chorizo - he said both were extremely underwhelming. My brother-in-law ordered a chicken burrito which he didn't have any complaints over. Later in the evening we all suffered from stomach pain probably due to high sodium levels even though we're healthy people. My husband and I decided we won't go back - it's not worth the misery. If you're in Solon and looking for Mexican, head over to Señorita Bonita's Mexican Grill & Cantina where you'll find authentic Mexican food, fresh ingredients and a lightning fast staff."}
{"text":"Hugely disappointed.  We really needed a high quality Mexican restaurant on the East side.  Unfortunately, it's form over substance.  Restaurant decor is awesome.  Guacamole is solid but doesn't compensate for the weak nacho chips.  Entrees (steak and shrimp) were just OK; same goes for the salsa.  Aside from decor, doesn't meet the food quality of Burntwood Tavern or M.  I'm going to give it another shot this evening, and will update my post if warranted."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by to try it out thinking it might be like luchitas tequila bar and grill in Hudson..  We were disappointed once our appetizer came in: Pacos Nachos. It wasn't gross just dissatisfying. Instead of actual jalapeños (like it says on the menu) we were served bell peppers and the sauce that came on it made it taste sweet.  I did not know what to do.. Instead of complaining I asked for some jalapeños from the kitchen to add to the nachos.. I was served \"grilled jalapeños\" instead.. Once cooked, the pepper loses its original spiciness! I was so disappointed with the service and nothing about the atmosphere was Mexican but the words on the menu. The name for the restaurant is misleading if you're looking for authentic Mexican, the only nice thing about the place is the atmosphere but it is everything but Mexican. You can find higher quality Mexican food at Taco Bell or del taco, this place didn't even have the right music.  It's more of a place to get a drink after work and an appetizer(if you can afford it)  Way over priced and you do not get what you pay for...  By the way my girlfriend and I got our food to go only to come across another Mexican restaurant called el chile bravo where it's authentic to the core and were way more satisfied.. Not to mention its affordable  Also I am 90% sure I was the only Mexican in the entire restaurant and got stared at the entire time I was there.."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced and below average food.  I've been there twice now (hey, I gave it a 2nd chance) and I wasn't impressed either time.    The pork belly taco was one slice of fatty bacon.  The fish taco was adequate.  For $12 (after tax and tip) you get two incredibly small tacos and a side of rice covered in refried beans.  You're way better off at quick-food style places like Qdoba or Chipotle."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this for awhile, but the reviews have been not so good.  Should have known better on a Frdiay night not to have to wait for a table!  Great decor, rustic.  Love the vibe.  Waitress was attentive.  There were three of us.  Two loved their food, and of course, I am the one writing this review and it couldn't have been more interesting.  I think that the name taco means taco.  I ordered a chicken taco with slaw on it.  I got a taco/buritto shell delivered with a large piece of hot deep fat fried overly breaded chicken on it, with slaw on top and another taco shell.  I get that you want to be creative..... I wouldn't dream of making anything that hideous for my family.  I asked the waitress was she joking, this is the farthest thing from a taco I have ever seen!  Just because you have taco shells doesn't mean you can put a BIG piece of fried chicken on it and call it a taco.  Really.  Hot chicken, with cold mayo slaw on top of it.  If I wanted that I would of gone to KFC, they are still open aren't they!  The waitress wanted to get me something else.   I said no thanks.  I'm good!  The manager did take it off the bill.  Here's an idea.  DESCRIBE on the menu what the item is.  CUT UP the chicken and make a taco out of it!!!!   Then the waitress disappeared when she needed to bring the bill.  Oh and one more thing.  Get some wine that is really popular now.  Like White Zin, Reisling, etc.  Maybe if you had some decent wine, I would have had a glass and not been so annoyed.  Different is one thing, feeding the masses in another."}
{"text":"The building was originally built for a national chain and was gutted and transformed into a cool, hip fun place to go. The back side of the restaurant has rolling garage door walls so you do get an al fresco dining experience even inside the building. If you are young and love a high volume on your \"background\" music and don't mind having to talk at a louder volume than usual, then you will love the atmosphere. The food although portion size is small, is well prepared and very delicious but costly for what you get. Taco dishes include 2 tacos (instead of 3 at some other restaurants) and comes with a cup of rice and black beans, very tasty but again small. Tacos are a double layer of corn tortilla about 5\" in diameter. Guacamole is prepared table side with 3 avocados, spices and herbs and is enough for 4-5 people to have generous portions, worth the $9 cost IMHO. The down side is the staff is very young and behaves in a fashion that exemplifies inexperience because of their lack of time in the service industry. The night I was there it was still pretty crowded at 8:00 on a week night but the staff was all very young, who by the way the place was rolling, might have been working their first job in this industry. If the goal of this place was to be competition to the restaurant/patio bar next door, then they have succeeded. If they wanted to attract a similar customer base as their others restaurants Burntwood Tavern and M, then they have a great deal to tweak."}
{"text":"Tiny portions of extremely bland, sad excuse for Mexican food. A one-two punch of disappointment. So angry that I gave them a dime! I wouldn't feed my dog this food. You'd do better by grabbing Mexican food at a gas station. They need to be boarded up and banned from stealing money from unsuspecting customers. Disgraceful! Literally tasted like paper. And that's an insult to paper. I ordered from here through UberEATS, worst experience ever. The tortillas were stale! The \"steak\" was minced mystery meat.  Beware, employees will LIE about the quality/size of the food. This was highway robbery!  I wish I could give negative stars"}
{"text":"The day I went was around 5pm and waited awhile for someone to even ask us for our drinks.10 minutes! The food came on this weird skinny rectangular plate allowing rice to fall all over the table! Lol then my lap. Very small portion. I got the burrito for 16 bucks ."}
{"text":"Restaurant has a great look and curb-appeal and sets standards high. However food is extremely disappointing. Seemed to be frozen and microwaved. Similar to the deteriorating quality of burntwood for those who know (same owners.)"}
{"text":"Too expensive,  for that food- CHANGE the menu, bring down the price and make some real Mexican food-  we want good Mexican! Service bad -  we went twice-- not going back until major changes occur!   Many native Mexicans around ..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times with my wife and friends. Atmosphere is great and the service is good. That said, when they first opened it seemed like they had a lot of entry level servers.   The table side Guacamole is delicious and is served with home made chips. They also have complimentary salsa that is really good and thick.   I love their tacos. Unique recipes that taste good. Full disclosure: I've never had anything else on the menu other than tacos.   Overall I like this place. It's not fine dining but it's a great fun evening out."}
{"text":"Summary: Taco Bell is way better and way cheaper.  Pacos Tacos is a genius name and the menu is incredibly simple. Excellent marketing, but terrible food.  I tried all of the meat options on two different tacos and a quesadilla. I also tried two of their salsas. Out of everything I ordered, I thought the side of sour cream was decent.  I honestly believe a drunk college student could make better tacos using \"whatever is in the fridge\" than what I had at Pacos Tacos tonight. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Taco Bell likely has better ingredients than this place. I might consider eating here again if the tacos are 50 cents or less and I'm completely drunk, otherwise I will never be back. I'm honestly amazed that a taco place could make a taco so repulsive, but this place has managed to do it. Save yourself the time, money, and bathroom trips- go to another taco spot!"}
{"text":"For me this place is fun. If you keep in mind this place is trying to get a feel for what it likes and what it doesn't. For those that never been its not really for kids or at least I've never noticed like kid friendly stuff. Tequila list is super nice and the happy hour is probably my favorite part. The guacamole cart for an appetizer is really good. I think for me personally this place would be better when it gets cold so they can close the doors because for me the flies are the worst. Oh for the tacos I had the steak, which was really good, so was the lamb. I also had the duck which was okay and the fish tacos. I had them when they first opened which they started out with Maui Maui fish which was sweet and delicious but then sadly they changed it and I'm not a fan. They said is was because people really didn't like it so sadly won't be getting it anymore. But as a fun happy hour place to go with friends I would say for sure but family dinner night probably not."}
{"text":"The guac was good and my food was good but had others say theirs wasn't. I had the crispy fish tacos so get those! We had guac which is a huge order plenty to share."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill fast.  Unfriendly, unprofessional, and untrained staff.  Food cold and just bad.  Promised myself I wouldn't go back did and payed for it.  Never again!"}
{"text":"cute inside, super small portions for big cost in comparison-NEVER again for food-drink menu is bigger then food menu-might try that, but can't afford to eat there and get full.  lukewarm bottle of water sits on table (I order water often)-NO ICE-went in nice weather, they have garage doors as wall and had open-bugs and birds flying around-YUCK. $40 bill for me and 2 kids and we left starving.  Son ordered soft taco dinner-it was 2 tacos the size of a dollar pancake, like one bite-off adult menu, don't know if even kids menu."}
{"text":"Warning do not eat here if you don't want food poisoning! I ate there last night and instantly became ill after eating the black bean tacos. I gave it a day to see if it could of been something else but nope for sure food poisoning. Not only did the food make me sick but the service was terrible highly disappointed considering how great M Italian and Burtwood are.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL!!!!!! The carne asada tacos I ordered were so disgusting they weren't even edible. I do not recommend wasting your money."}
{"text":"CAUTION: SLIPPERY FLOOR!!!! This is actually the second time I have visited Pacos Tacos. I thought I would give it another try since the first time I was not impressed. Every table receives an attractive clear bottle of cold water, chips and salsa. The first time the chips were so salty, we could barely eat them. The second time they were cooked perfectly and salted just right. The salsa was EXTREMELY garlicky both times. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE garlic, but that much mixed in salsa was way beyond comprehension!!!! The food was good, but seems overpriced for what you get. I had the Spicy Margarita Flight both visits, which includes strawberry pepper, spicy mango habanero, and spicy grapefruit. All are WONDERFUL with a spicy salt rim. The Mexican Fried Ice Cream is a must, with a cornflake crust and honey lightly drizzled over it, accompanied by a couple dollops of homemade whipped cream on the side. Both visits we had the same server Alyssa, which was a delight, and I would definitely request her each time. Don't forget if you have a Burntwood Tavern VIP card, you can use it at Pacos Tacos AND \"M\" in Chagrin Falls, which are the same Owners. In fact I saw a couple managers that have moved over from Burntwood to this location. Another thing that gives this restaurant one less star is the EXTREME slippery floor both visits, and cannot see it changing anytime in the near future. EXTREME CAUTION IS NECESSARY!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"While it is a nicely decorated establishment, the food was not anything special. The variety on the menu was low. I did like that you can get a flight of margaritas and there are some interesting flavors. For my flight, I got the spicy mango (not very spicy in my opinion but still tasty), sweet strawberry (very sweet, but good), and the watermelon (my least favorite and didn't taste like watermelon). You get a lot for the $8 flight so that was nice. My mom got the traditional margarita which she said was not worth its price and was small. My dad order a beer, and they brought him the wrong one.m, but he didn't realize it until he drank half of it. The chips and salsa were very good and we got plenty of them. The chips are presented in a brown bag ... I think this is wasteful.   We were seated promptly. Our waitress was nice, but any time we asked for anything like more water or silverware, I felt like I was asking the world from her. Our drinks seemed to take quite a long time to come to our table. She did bring things somewhat quickly when asked. The restaurant was kinda busy, not packed for a Saturday night, so I will give her the benefit of the doubt.   My dad and I each ordered a mix-and-match combo of the tacos, which costs $1 -$2 more than if you just order 3 of the same tacos. I think this is a weird concept, considering many places I have been allow you to just pick what tacos you want for like $3/taco. The tacos are very small but they do put a good amount of meat in them. You also get a side of rice and beans. I just had the rice, which I found very dry and bland. The tacos I got were steak, chicken mole, and barbacoa, they were good, but nothing special. My mom got the chicken burrito. At first glance, it looked very good because they grill press the tortilla. But inside, it was mostly rice, some beans, and little chicken. My mom and I both prefer burritos with fresh lettuce, tomato, etc so this burrito was not our favorite. It was okay, but I would definitely pick Chipotle over this burrito any time.   Overall, my parents and I would not return to this restaurant. We have been to places that are much better than here. The only time I would return is if some friends wanted to go during happy hour (7 days a week). I might try one of their appetizers if I did ever return."}
{"text":"I've been going next door (to Genos) for years. Absolutely love it. Was stoked to see they opened up a taco shop in the same building as well! Try their tacodillas. Super good and cheesy. Only $4 too. Love it! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Tried shrimp tacos and crispy shrimp both were delicious. Casual place but good food. Would come here again."}
{"text":"To be honest, Paco's Tacos wasn't much more than an atmosphere. An awesome place, with good enough service, and a nice vibe. Chips and salsa were really good, and I was super excited to get my tacos. Unfortunately, the portions were expensive for two very small tacos. I was disappointed, and this is the reason that Paco's isn't a 4-5 star establishment. Expensive and small portions will leave you hungry or with empty pockets- my recommendation is pass on Paco's, and go somewhere else for your Mexican fix."}
{"text":"I think most of these reviews are spot-on. Average food, decent service (I have never had horrible service like many have stated). Also, I think the prices are extremely reasonable. Where are you people eating that you find this expensive? Taco Bell? And while it's clearly better than taco bell, the food really could be better. How hard is Mexican food, right? Anyway, the guac is truly excellent, probably the only thing I can say that about.  The rest of the various tacos, etc, are so-so. The corn tortillas tend to fall apart. The lime rice was overly salty, inedible (and the server was oblivious to the fact that I took one bite and ditched the rest--yes, I could have said something, but the beer made up for it, so I wasn't in the mood to complain).  I would do 2.5 stars if I could, but since I figure this is about a 2.6, I went 3 since it seems everyone else is being pretty critical. The building is cool, with the large window/doors that open when the weather permits, and in Cleveland, we don't get to enjoy that very often. Oh, and the chips and salsa are at least 4 stars, so there's that."}
{"text":"Cool place, will return. I'm Mexican so grading it from 1-10 scale, it gets a 7. The tableside Guac is great, just omit the tomatoes and onions. The chips are warm, fresh and awesome. I had the chix and carnitas tacos. Too much onions on chix and the carnitas had BBQ sauce that was too much and that is not Mexican.  Will come back because the place has good vibe. The decor is rad. Cholas, low-riders, sculls, palenque, and la lucha libre... Orale!"}
{"text":"My wife, son, and I visited for dinner.  Service was excellent.  Tacos were very good, portions modest but very tasty....e.g., spicy duck.  Chorizo date appetizer was overpriced for what it was.  Margaritas were very good.  In short we were happy and will come back."}
{"text":"A great experience all around. I had the rock shrimp tacos and they were delicious. The chips and salsa were also very good, the salsa clung well to the chips. The service was great and the manager makes you feel welcome.  A fair warning, if you're really hungry and getting tacos, you may want to get an appetizer or two orders. Each order has two tacos, about 3.5 or 4 inches across."}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I decided to try something different from our usual Mexican restaurants, and ended up at this place. First off, the service was mediocre at best. The waitress seemed less than thrilled to be at work. I don't recall her cracking a smile not even once while she served us. I ordered a root beer was flat so I asked if she could take it back, which she did and never offered an alternative. The food arrived quickly, which was a plus. Our satisfaction quickly faded once we dug into our meal. The queso was the 1st to arrive, which was barely warm, like they nuked it in the microwave for 20 seconds before bringing it out. And the proportion we got for $9 was laughable. He ordered 3 tacos: roasted chicken mole, steak, and mahi. Of the 3, he said the best was the chicken, as the other 2 were tasteless. I had the blackened shrimp, carnitas, and baja fish tacos. If I had to choose the best, I would go with the carnitas, which actually wasn't bad, but after forcing the other 2 disappointing tacos down I didn't have the appetite for it. Bottom line is we won't be returning, and have agreed to never stray from our favorites, Barrio and Cozumel."}
{"text":"The notion of Mexican cuisine sans spices is unheard of. Garlic, cumin, onions, cilantro, salt and pepper promise to give flavor and texture, but Paco never heard of this. Instead , the carne asada was bland and just plain awful.   At first, I intrigued as to why the decor was the Day of the Dead. After eating, I know why."}
{"text":"Went to paco tacos for an early lunch with my mom, our server was great and the tacos were deeeeelicious! I love the table side gauc service! But those huge carts are a little much being pushed across the room. But it's so good! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with a Freind on a Sunday afternoon before the dinner rush. Sat in the bar and are service was Amazing. The food was fast and delicious. I would recommend this place over and over again"}
{"text":"Last night was my mom's and my first time at Pacos. We met a friend and ordered a round of cocktails, which we all enjoyed. My mom and her friend both ordered the Baja fish tortas and I ordered the Baja fish taco and steak taco. The fish taco was good but messy. The steak taco was nasty. The meat wasn't good and it was so dry I didn't even finish it. The server we had wasn't really informed about the food and didn't say much to me when I said the steak taco wasn't good he didn't say anything. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed!!! I love love Mexican! Queso And salsa in a jar  are better...had the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos.... Horrible. Traditional margaritas are good. Service was slow but staff was very nice. Will not give it another try ... Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Few quick notes after two visits.   The tacos are alright except the portions are pathetically small. It's a joke for $9.   Floor is very slippery   Music was way too loud   Servers are in need of more training and/or experience   Chips were very salty   I would take Barrio or even Chipotle over Paco Taco's any day. Both are much more tasty and generous."}
{"text":"So far since being seated our waitress acts as if she doesn't want to be here. We had to get our silverware from another table, our trash from the bags of chips and salsa bowl has been sitting at the end of our table for about 15 minutes, even after food was given to us she just left it there, and our food all came out at different times. The food that has come out so far looks really good.  But far as service goes.... It sucks!"}
{"text":"The service is great, our waitress Ruby, was awesome. The portions aren't really  \"American sized\",  but there is enough food for normal people! Pork belly tacos were delicious.  The table side guacamole is delightful! Just on a side note, there is a giant painting of a cock fight on the wall."}
{"text":"Give it another try. The inside is adorable with decor. The tacos were full to the max and good insides, especially the pineapple slaw. The torta was delicious, the bread was great on it. The burger was sooo good, big and hand packed meat, ask for a side of chipotle mayo to add a little kick, the guac on it makes it. The fries were so hot and good but over salted majorly. The corn cakes weren't my fav, wanted some sweet in it but was a little flavorless, at least it was warm! The corn Chips and salsa are perfect, come out warm. Only weird thing was the tortilla, not a fan of how dense it was, not a traditional American tortilla. Our waitress was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently ate at Pacos Tacos. We have ate at Burntwood Taverns and M Italian so we were excited to try it. We ordered the $9 guacamole which was sent back because the avocados were not ripe. The lobster quesadilla was oily and the enchiladas were smothered in sauce. The carne asada tacos were probably the best item we had but the portion was not enough. To be honest it's just a middle of the road Mexican restaurant. I had higher expectations for the Burntwood Group."}
{"text":"Been once, the first two times the line was out the door.  The service is good with enthusiastic servers that are unobtrusive but still available to keep the water full and provide for requests. Good food for a vegetarian and meat eaters."}
{"text":"Attended on a Saturday night so we knew we would have to wait. However there is no where to wait. I mean nothing. Nothing inside and no benches on their long sidewalks outside. No where to sit was a minus.   Now for the food. A nice change of pace for Solon and the surrounding that nothing outside of seniority Benitos.  Chips and salsa fine.  I had pork belly tacos which I give a four star. I don't drink so I can't rate the bar."}
{"text":"$9 for four bites worth of taco?  Come on now...  Chips were pretty good, especially the appetizer version with the carnitas on top.  But overall for the amount of food you get the price is not right here.  Only thing saving it from one star was the nachos."}
{"text":"Cheap prices, basic food, very poor service. Our bill was under 20 dollars but somehow our food beat our drinks to the table and service was slowwwww"}
{"text":"The food was alright, service was slow. Staff treated us like we were an annoyance at the door & management seemed confused. Not impressed."}
{"text":"The food and service was great! The lobster and shrimp quesadilla is a must have! The shredded pork taco and fish taco are good."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Looking over and seeing all the employees sitting down while my guest and I both needed water refills. Made the guacamole table side, but didn't offer any chips. My husband had to go to the bar and ask for more chips and water.  No prebussing of any sort. Corn cakes tasted like stale corn bread. The best part of the visit was the friendly manager that seated us AND cashed us out."}
{"text":"New to the area and it was packed. A good sign. Had the Carnitas Torta. Unique and tasty. Came with four monster size fries. Definitely try the chipotle seasoned ketchup.  Great kick. They just need to laminate their menus so they are clean or toss the soiled ones."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant, waited 8 min for someone to come to our table. No one ever did.  Talk about poor service. Walked out!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst tacos I've ever had. The 5 star reviews had to have been bough or put up by the owners. The Carne asada tacos taste like shoe leather that's been left out for a week. Their sauces are both stale. The staff was unprepared and we had to order at the genos pizza next door because they're owned by the same people. Check out their reviews to get a more accurate tale of this place, but Please most of all go somewhere else, anywhere else but not here."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for Paco's.  The interior is trendy with interesting light fixtures. The ones above our table were bulbs suspended in a burlap sack.  Interesting.    We started with the queso \"fondue\".  (Queso fundido?)  It was good and you could taste the onions and poblanos.  The chips came out in a brown paper bag which was good when we went to leave and didn't have to put them in another container.    We ordered two flights of tequila.  You don't get a lot in the flights.  We have three pours of less than 1 oz each.  The tequilas we tried were all very good and they have a great selection.   For our mains we ordered three taco plates.  My wife had the chicken Tinga in hard shells, I had the pork belly in soft shells, and we split the brisket in soft shells.  I think the brisket was our mutual favorite.  The flavor was good and smoky.  The pork belly was good as well but lacked something.  It would have been nice if the slaw was a little tangier to complement it.    The sides we had were the black beans and rice, vegetables, and corn cakes.  The corn cakes were the winner, hands down.  They were moist and sweet and reminded me of corn \"spoon bread\".    The black beans and rice were very bland. The only thing I could taste in them was the faint hint of cumin. They desperately needed salt and pepper, garlic, and a few other things.    The vegetables, while cooked to a nice al-dente, were completely devoid of any discernible flavor.  They consisted of green beans and red bell peppers cooked under a broiler.  Some garlic and salt would have gone a long way.    Overall, our experience was not horrible but it's doubtful we'll be back."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken tacos were excellent and I loved the rice and beans cooked in their own casserole dish. Still, I think that this food is overpriced. No alcohol, and my dinner was still $17 before the tip."}
{"text":"Our server was nice. The staff didn't seem to be happy though... Guacamole was great! Tasted both chicken tacos and found them to be very salty. We ordered tuna ceviche, and it was a little disappointing. Served over tortilla chips, which is lame considering I just ate 20 of them we get with salsa. Not much tuna and a redundant amount of chips. I could see this being a good place for a drink and a snack but that's it."}
{"text":"My first experience at Pacos Tacos started out mediocre, the wait was tedious. But, the entire experience was uphill from there. The manager personally apologized for our wait and gave us complimentary cheese sauce with our chips and salsa. The cheese sauce was full of flavor and the salsa had a unique aftertaste that had me eating non stop.   The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and we all started eating. I ordered the barbacoa torta and the flavors were spectacular. It had a slight heat to it but was mostly mild. My only complaint was the bread got soggy after eating for a while.  The waitress was very attentive and nice and always was there when we ran out of water. This was a five star experience and I would definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Stopped by this taco shop yesterday with two friends after we saw it while walking into the pizza place next door. We ordered some \"tacodillas\" after the staff recommended trying them and a platter of 10 carne asada tacos.  THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SMALL HIDDEN GEMS!  We couldn't get enough and ordered 6 more.  The pick was fresh, the salsa was hot and flavorful. I liked the corn and the four tortillas.  BUT, the tacodilla I had was so good.  I am definitely going back weekly.  The store is nothing fancy, but I like that.  It's a taco shop... that really knows how to deliver a great taco."}
{"text":"Place half full but service is slow. Staff are not well trained. Good concept but they are dropping the ball in so many ways theatre easily fixed  Update. Tacos showed up and we cold."}
{"text":"I love burntwood however this is not up to the owners standard. Food is sub par and the tequila is also limited. We eat at many good taco stands around Cleveland and this one is not one of them."}
{"text":"I love the concept and I love the decor, but compared to the food at the original Burntwood, I just don't think this place stacks up. They have great appetizers including a HUGE plate of nachos and table side guacamole, but the actual tacos are pretty bad. I tried the rock shrimp tacos and ended up just eating the shrimp off of my plate because the tortillas were crumbling as soon as I picked them up. Also the portion sizes are small in my opinion, with the tacos only coming with 4 or 5 shrimp a piece. The tacos also come with a side of rice and beans, but that is also a small portion and I found it to be a bit too spicy for my liking.  The desserts are great though, especially the fried ice cream, so Pacos Tacos does have some redeeming qualities, just not their tacos... Personally, I would rather go around the corner to Burntwood for the price as of now, but we'll see if they make some changes to their menu as they try to establish themselves, I think they're still getting some kinks worked out!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, chips and salsa, and can't beat the happy hour!!! The staff was on top of refills and when I needed hot sauce they were running to grab it."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place! Although the lobster quesadilla was good, the rest was not. The worst was that my 11 year old son found a 1 inch long chicken bone (presumably not from some other animal) in his taco!! We told the waitress, who seemed horrified, but the manager never even came over to apologize. We've had better treatment at chain restaurants like Longhorn! After that we hardly saw her at all & they were not even that busy. It took about 20 minutes or more after we were finished to even ask for the check!  I would avoid this place. Try Tres Potrillos for Mexican instead. They actually have decent food without stray bones!"}
{"text":"Ooooook.....so this taco place is in a Delivery Mart which is attached to Ginos pizza. The soda machine was broken, so that was a bummer. The chicken and carne asada are actually not bad, hence two stars however the meat was not hot temperature wise... both were cold. The girl at the register said they were street tacos,  not true.  Regular flour tortillas you can buy at the grocery store, which added nothing to the taco.  Pico was alright. The hot and extra hot sauces are just gross. Definetly disappointed and can't say I would give them a second try."}
{"text":"My area has recently acquired a lot of new Mexican restaurants.  This is by far my least favorite.  The portions are tiny and not really tasty.  The prices are way, way out of proportion.  The restaurant seems to be trying for the \"upscale market\" (the folks who might be willing to pay $10 for two itsy-bitsy tacos.  Sadly, while the prices qualify for a \"gourmet rating,\" the food just doesn't.  The service, too, is so-so--or was when I visited.  Good point--it seems that the place is often so near empty that diners can have a private conversation with no fear of being overheard.  Personally, though, I'd choose the public library for a chat and skip this place."}
{"text":"The food was bland and portions are small for the price.  One of our taco meals had cold steak.  Liked the decor and the service was good.  May give it another try in hopes the food is better but am in no hurry.  Had high hopes but was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Nothing special food is not that good and its too spicy. Plus, service is horrible waited 1hr to for us to get our food. And you need to ask the servers for water, silverware, plate and menu. I dont recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"This is great little soppy to have an early dinner or late lunch. Tacos $3-4, with happy hour prices everyday 3-6! $4 margaritas that are the best around! The place is nicely decorated and the service was good. I think my kids would eat the food and I would just order of he big kids menu."}
{"text":"After a day soaking up the summer sun at Wildwater Kingdom, I worked up quite an appetite.  Loving Mexican type establishments, I was pleased to see this new stop on the way in to wwk.    I was fearful going in that it would be \"a rigrous display of simple foods overly priced and displayed\"  Well...I was sort of right.  The specialty, tacos of course, actually tasted quite good.  Very flavorful in the mouth.  Somewhat small, but I was sure to eat enough of them to make up for the growling stomach :)  I was disappointed with the table-side made guacamole; not sure what it was, but something was missing.  The prices were a bit high per my prediction, however I was there during happy hour which was half off and saved the meal from being obnoxiously overpriced and small portions.  For a good experience, go there during happy hour and get half priced tacos!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place by driving by and decided to stop in for lunch. Really like the atmosphere. Concrete walls with hand painted murals and modern chandeliers surround several booths and a large u-shaped bar.  Big windows allow a lot of light and make it seem larger than it is but not cavernous.   Ordered the IPA and spiced duck tacos. Very tasty!  The tacos were flavorful and light with a side of beans, rice and melted cheese. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  Straight forward menu and not as overdone as most Mexican. I like their take on street food for a quick but sophisticated lunch."}
{"text":"Very limited menu. Though if you love street tacos this is the best place to get them. Now if you go into this place thinking its Barrio, you're going to be upset because it's not. Prices are fair. I got the Chorizo and Sweet Potato tacos. Very unique idea of taking the classic spin of  sweet and spicy."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  The table side guacamole was highly recommended so we started with that.  The waitress brought a trainee who she said she had trained herself and left the trainee alone to make it. She clearly was nervous and shared with us that she had never tasted guacamole, let alone an avocado.  As expected, it was bland (we asked for it to be spicy) with too big chunks of avocado. My friend got three tacos that looked more like appetizers than an entree. The quesadilla I ordered was average at best.  The bill was $125, for drinks and bad food. I don't see a future for this place. To the manager- train your people and make sure they have tasted what they are serving."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. We came in as a group of 6 and I had to tell the waiter that we need more than one bag of chips and one bowl of salsa. If not, it'd have to constantly be moved for the people on the far end of the table. Then he forgot our straws and the alcoholic drink orders, thank god we had water.  The tacos are tiny and not worth any price. Nothing special. Sorry this place is such a loser I really wanted a taco place closer than Cleveland.  Luckily there's Senorita Bonita's which is a fabulous establishment!"}
{"text":"Not authentic Mexican food. It wasn't terrible a good late night place. It's basically a pizza joint adding a taco stand in the back. The mission tortilla was crispy not fresh and authentic. A notch above Taco Bell.  The people there are nice and it's clean and new I just didn't eat my food. Took a few bites and tossed it in favor of going some place else"}
{"text":"This is my first updated review, and I am adding one star to it.  Sadly, the service was still very slow, even though it was not crowded. We still did not see our server much. We ended up snatching our own napkins and utensils off a nearby table, because we had none when our food arrived. My friend and I also had to ask 3 times for waters, and as we neared the end of the meal, we walked to the bar to get them ourselves.   I have given Pacos Tacos 4 tries now, both at lunch and dinner. The acoustics in the restaurant make it a loud place, so its not super ideal for conversation or meetings. Previously, my guests and I had issues with receiving incorrect orders and being over charged for things, and being caught up in the restaurant for 1.5-2+ hours.   Updated pros: 1. For the first time, my order was correct! 2. For the first time, our bill was correct, and we weren't charged for things we didn't order or never came. 3. The food seemed generally improved, and less overwhelmingly spicy than usual. 4. We were able to get out in under 1.5 hours. Hooray!  I am happy that those improvements have been made, because I do see potential in Pacos Tacos. I hope they will continue to make improvements on the service side."}
{"text":"Horrendous service. Our server, Steffani was either on drugs or alcohol while she \"served us\". Slurred speech and forgetfulness. Drinks sat empty for several minutes before we flagged down another server for refills. The food was mediocre, at best. Atmosphere and decor were cool. I would get rid of that train wreck of a server if you want to continue having business. Worst service I have EVER received in my life!"}
{"text":"These tacos have to be the best STYLE TACOS I've ever had! The food was amazing, the owner recommended to try the tacodilla and I've never had anything like it! And the best part was it was very filling! Not like many other places that give you barely anything for your money. Not only was the food great but so was the customer service was stellar and the place was very clean and neat! I also thought it was cool it was connected to the pizza joint right next door which is also AMAZING."}
{"text":"Try the tacodillas, OMG Amazing!!!! Was at Genos and saw they opens a taco shop next door, it's diff worth the try fresh very fresh. Open till 5am Wow"}
{"text":"The places looks nice, but it is so loud you cant hear yourself think. The tacos were tasteless, and embarrassing small. Two tiny tacos for $9 ? We ordered Queso dip, and it was brought out with nothing. we had to wait another 5 minutes for chips. The server had no clue. These guys have good ideas as to concepts, they just need to serve better food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  First, if you go, make sure it's during happy hour!  My niece chose this place for her birthday get-together. She, my mom or sister have not been here before.  I was once, last summer, and thought it was a great place.  I knew they had good chips and salsa and pretty tasty margaritas.  Server, \"H\", needs to go back into training.  She was very frumpy and without a smile or even eye contact.  She took our drink and food orders. We ordered a flight and individual margarita's.  The flight and one drink comes out and is being served by someone else.  Flight was good, single drink was not the way it was ordered.  The guy who served it didn't know what kind it was so we sipped it to try and guess, it ended up being cucumber, which I ordered, but I asked for a salted rim.  All drinks came separately, as well as the food!  And served by others, not our server.  You can count the people in this place, so being busy was not an excuse.   Food was ok, drinks were fine, until my mom found a hair in her rice and beans!  Total turn off.  She told our server, who said \" I am sorry!\" That's all!  Really??  The manager came over immediately and apologized.  We asked our server for the check.  We looked it over and found my mom's meal and drink were comped.  Server tells us \" thank you, I hope you have a better evening\".  Not good!  I don't see this place lasting long at all!"}
{"text":"Visit one experience, sit down style: Small tacos. Dry side of rice. Overpowering flavor of black bean in everything.... Servers wait on you with stank eye. May as well have eaten my meal with the families and friends around me - absolutely not privacy!   Visit two experience, sitting at the bar: slow as eff service and confusion. Margarita Flight was so watery. And the dessert was so basic as a fried tempura churro thing. Eh. The bartender wasn't too welcoming either. Why didn't you wanna serve me :(?  p.s. Totally can see the old bones of Applebees, RIP."}
{"text":"The lamb and the pork belly tacos were very good. Didn't care for the duck. Personal dislike of a seasoning they used. But, the corn cakes are superb and I just want to make a meal of them with some of that lamb they slow cook.  Overall, considering the price it's a fun lunch that won't kill your pocketbook. Service was just right and the vibe is cool. I think I'll come back but it won't be a regular standby place. But those corn cakes . . .  My wife says I'm being too generous!  BTW - I'm an old man and the floors are dangerously slippery. The entire time I was walking to the bathroom I was afraid I might slip, break a hip and wind up in a nursing home. My wife says she will put me there if that happens."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, just go to Barrio.   The pork and fish tacos are very bland and the ground meat has little seasoning.  The service was good, but the place was empty"}
{"text":"The food is good but I have to give them 3 stars because their chips they leave on the counter for snacking are not labeled. The chips are pork skins. Being a vegetarian I had no idea what they were but was happy I asked. I wonder how many non pork eaters accidentally consumed this \"fried animal skin\" called chips?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and really enjoyed the food, all the ingredients tasted fresh!! I would recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for good street tacos and fast service for a lunch break."}
{"text":"Sub par food, poor service and over priced.  The margaritas are good, but the tacos are not, so its not worth being there.  The best thing in our meal (we had 3 kinds of tacos, the chicken tortilla soup, corn cakes, and 2 of the little single serving desserts) was the corn cakes. You know its bad when a little kid won't finish their dessert.  We got the key lime and the chocolate one and neither of even finish the tiny little dessert. Yuck."}
{"text":"Both seats were covered in crumbs. Had to brush them aside. Server was prompt and refills occurred regularly.Chips and salsa were good and plentiful . We had American taco, calamari , and Baja fish taco. I think the sizes of the tacos were to be expected, and could see how some may consider them to be small. Calamari was best with the peach salsa being on point . Baja fish taco was just ok with a little too much southwest sauce . American taco was just a no. We sampled a side of rice, but in the end it was just ok . I think we will try them again. There is potential and still a few things to sample."}
{"text":"Updated Review.   I have gone back quite a few times since they opened. Since then the service has consistently been slow. I thought that this was just a symptom of being brand new but it has stayed slow enough where it is hard to justify coming here on a lunch break.  But the bigger issue for me is that they removed the \"fancier\" items from the menu that, for me, made the higher price worth it. They no longer carry the lobster or rock shrimp tacos which were both fantastic. I thought they also told me they removed the duck taco but I still see it on the menu so I may be wrong about that one.  On my most recent visit I tried the enchiladas since they no longer carried the items I planned on ordering. They were just not good at all. The red sauce on them was horrible and if you must get enchiladas make sure to get the green sauce. The bartender actually recommended that I not get the enchiladas; I should have heeded her advice."}
{"text":"The decor in this place is great and they have a pretty good happy hour. The service was decent but those are the only nice things I can say about this establishment. The food is overpriced for the portion sizes and nothing I ate tasted close to being Mexican or good at all. They should be closed!"}
{"text":"Too expensive- smaller portions..food good enough but nothing special. The staff friendly and lots of parking"}
{"text":"Overall, this place is good. Creations that you don't get anywhere else on the menu. Recommend the mole chicken, shrimp, and whitefish tacos. I actually preferred the size because it made the meal feel more authentic or like tapas. Table side guacamole is also something to give a shot, because you can tailor it based on your palate of spicy, medium of mild. Service lacked and I must say, the skinny margarita was not something I would order again but I really was intrigued by the flights they had. Warm chips, good salsa, great flavors, awesome atmosphere....not much more you can ask for when it comes to mod Mex. we will be back and hope the things that lacked a little, pick back up."}
{"text":"We have been here four times and I must say that both the service and product have worsened each time. It usually takes a very long time to both receive food and have your order taken. I ordered one dish that had sunflower seeds and they were frozen with ice covering them! The tacos contents have changed as well...less meat and not as tasty as before."}
{"text":"greeted nicely at the door by a younger gal that was SUPER nice and sweet. Got seated rather quickly, ordered beverages right away.  Sever (Vanessa), she needs to have training 101 all over again. I understand in a busy place on a Saturday things can get overwhelming, but in a customer service industry, don't show that to people. She was just not working with even a half a deck. Lights out!  There were a few bills at the table as we had a party of 6, all 3 needed to be fixed.  I will personally come back here not only because how nicely we were greeted upon coming in (for the first time), but the food was good. Just wish there was more of it. I recommend to anyone to try the sandwiches, great! The salsa chips are better than Chipotle even (I felt they were the best before I came here). Would have been a 5 star but the server dropped it down to a lower 4."}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant.  I have been wanting to try this place for lunch.  So my husband and I went today.  The table was dirty, the chairs had food on them and the menus even were dirty.  Not to mention the table was wobbly and uneven.  Don't know how the food is as we didn't even get a glass of water offered to us as we sat and waited for at least ten minutes.  So needless to say we left and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Tempe hands down! I definitely recommended the tacodilla, which is two tortillas of your choice filled with mozzarella cheese and topped with savory Carne Asada or chicken and your choice of toppings"}
{"text":"Big swing and a big miss. Wow... Disappointing, crazy expensive dry tacos and dustbowl rice. Server was slow and not happy to be there. We all had tacos, chicken Tinga and steak. Portions were small and well done. Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Very Cool place. Margaritas are excellent. Food is just ok, nothing great. Service...not very good at all. I really want to like this place because the atmosphere and the drinks are excellent and so I will give it another try but I won't give it a third try if it doesn't improve the food really isn't all that it's hyped up to be."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork, fish and portobello tacos for lunch. Wasn't super crazy about the first two but that mushroom taco was fantastic! It had hearty mushrooms, sweet potatoes and a little bit of a kick to them; my fav thus far! And the frozen mango margarita was perfect while I sat in the garage-styled patio. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Aside from the chips and table side guacamole tasting wonderful everything else was disappointing. From the start we waited a few minutes just to be seated while the host talked on the phone. Our drinks can out wrong and waited half way through dinner to ever receive them.  We asked for straws twice but I ended up getting them at the bar myself. Our food orders can out mixed up, we had to swap food on our plates to get the correct tacos we wanted. We asked for hard shell and we received corn.   Throughout our lunch you can hear surrounding tables missing drinks and returning their wrong items. The place is poorly ran and the wait stuff seems unorganized."}
{"text":"Giving them 5 Stars although I never got the tacos I ordered. Our waitress seemed to be overwhelmed, but it wasnt her fault. The GM came to our large party and apologized for the way the night was going and even brought drinks and appetizers on him. The margarita flight is AMAZING!! This was the best peach margarita I have ever had. I plan to return soon to see if the food is as good as it looked!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time I was underwhelmed second time a waste of money and will not return. People's food brought to the table cold and tacos just not very good. I would not recommend going here. I'd prefer taco bell."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a later dinner bar side. Atmosphere is great...food is average at best. We have much better Mexican restaurants in the area. I had shrimp taco which was good, carnitas taco was bland. Beans and rice side dish was dry. Probably will not be back....sorry Burntwood"}
{"text":"The food is so so and can be quite hit or miss. A unique environment but highly overpriced, food and beverage wise. Portions are quite small and since they have opened they have cheapened some of their ingredients. For example when they first opened their Baja tacos were mahi mahi and now they are cod or possibly even haddock and the price has actually increased slightly. Possibly worth it during happy hour. Their tacos seem to be hit or miss as well. I found the shrimp taco to be very good but the Americana taco was pretty bland and tasteless. Their sides are also hit or miss. I've had fresh corn cakes but I've also had very stale, dry, and hardened rice. I'm honestly shocked it hasn't closed yet. But, in summation,  If you're hungry / looking for value keep looking because you will not be full and you will not get a value.   If you're in the area from 3-6 and are looking for a quick in between stop of lunch and dinner then 6 dollars for two small tacos and a small side may be a step up option than a fast food drive thru. After all you could get a 2dollar corona to go with it and that is not something you could order at arbys. But that is about all Pacos is good for."}
{"text":"It always takes me longer to write a 2 star review because I feel bad and want to be fair.  the tableside guacamole is a nice touch and very tasty. We ordered nachos which were huge. Other than that, the servings were small and disproportionate to the prices. The flavors were pretty underwhelming also. We were on our lunch break, but waited a very long time for food and were over 45 minutes late coming back to work.  One of my dining companions got the wrong tacos, so she sent them back and asked for her correct order. The replacement never came! We stood around waiting and the manager finally came out and said 'well, your meal was comped, so we assumed you didn't want anything'. WHAAAT??? Her meal, which never arrived, of COURSE should have been free. But you let a guest leave your restaurant hungry? Emptyhanded?  Didn't even send her with some chips so she wasn't starved.   Our server was nice, but along with the other reviews here, seemed frazzled. Paco's is poorly managed, lots of empty tables but long waits. My coworkers have all had bad experiences here."}
{"text":"Found this place next door to my favorite pizza shop and can I just say that Tempe better watch out because this place is top notch!. The tacodilla is so simple but so delicious 5/5 stars! I will be back"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Pacos Tacos and it was a great experience! I ordered a chicken tacodilla and was very excited to see they had bottled Mexican sodas. Jordan was the only staff member in and he was very friendly. We chatted while he made my tacodilla which made the short wait more enjoyable!  They have a simple menu that they perfected. The meat was well seasoned and it very was filling. Definitely an quick and easy stop, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really delicious tacos. Slightly judgmental waitress. A bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Seeing the restaurant always crowded I had high expectations.  I anticipated fresh ingredients, and interesting combinations of meats, vegetables and flavors in the tacos. I was disappointed.  I've seen most of the menu offerings at other restaurants. The restaurant tried but ended up a poor imitation of top quality places like Rosa Mexicano.  People enjoying the restaurant appeared to be there for the drinks, not the food. Atmosphere is nice and service was outstanding, but the food lacked taste and creativity."}
{"text":"Found an opportunity to visit on a Tuesday evening, and check out the mixed reviews. Love the decor--trendy, modern, open, cool light fixtures. Full bar. Great margaritas. Had the best informative, attentive waiter. Ordered grilled fish tacos on soft flour tortillas, and a mixed plate of fish, chicken and beef on hard corn shells. We were a bit surprised to see the smaller tortillas, but the price was right, and add in the chips and salsa. The fish tacos with peach were mild and yummy. The meat ones were very good. I had the optional mixed vegetables. So good!  We liked it all!! Remember that reviews are opinions.  Try Paco's Tacos for yourself."}
{"text":"Bar tender complained the whole time, food way below average. Barrio anyone? I guess the chips were worth one star . The tacos were just bad!"}
{"text":"I think if you change the wording to Pacos Tequila/Tacos instead of Pacos Tacos/Tequila you wont go wrong.  You will know that you are going for very good drinks and very very good tequila, and fancy but small (some would say overpriced) tacos. Fun atmosphere, fun crowd ( majority yuppy-but nothing wrong with that).  If you want to go during dinner time make sure you make reservations, and the place is small so it is loud.  All in all it was okay, again good place to get some good tequila."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst tacos ever. No flavor. Not hearty. Wimpy. Meh. Service sucked. Guac was good. But it was priced accordingly! We had a big party and the consensus was that it wouldn't be a go-to restaurant for us."}
{"text":"Things went bad from the moment I walked in the door. I entered and the first employee I saw was a young man with big muscles and lots of acne, I said, \"Hello\" and gave him a big smile. He honestly scowled at me and walked right past. Oooook. So I made my way to the bar. Noticing on the way a large mural of two chickens fighting. Literally a cock fighting scene on the wall. Is promoting animal cruelty cool these days? The bar top where I sat had bits of food and liquid on it. The manager, who was four feet away behind the bar, looked right at me so again I smiled, she just turned and walked away. Oooook, not feeling very welcome here. After about two minutes a bubbly blond bartender came over and put a drink napkin down right on top of the liquid and crumbs. I asked her to please wipe down the bar. She gave me a pretty snotty response like it was a chore. That being done, I ordered a Negroni. Not only did she have no clue what it was, neither of the other two girls behind the bar did either. It's a pretty popular drink these days. None of the three bartenders had ever even heard of it? Not great bartenders. At this point I knew the rest of my stay would be uncomfortable so I left. I haven't done that in years. The Burntwood group of eateries is growing very quickly. Maybe too quickly. In my opinion the staff needs better training. It's the hospitality business and they were anything but hospitable."}
{"text":"Good food with great prices. Lobster Chowder.  It had a cheese base with chunks of lobster.   Rock Shrimp Tacos The habanero mango salsa was tasty, but too hot for me. It is the kind of hot that sits on the tongue & just intensifies. I ate the tacos with the salsa that comes with the chips. I was very happy with that.    Beans & Rice Just how I like it with perfectly cooked rice. Served with  a little cheese on top.   Lauren was our server. She was excellent. She was knowledge & very friendly.  I love how they bring the water out in bottles & serve it.  I will definitely go back to try other things that interested me on the menu."}
{"text":"This place blows. I don't care about the decor. The food was sub par, warm at best, and not executed well. Cheap, sloppy, and gross. Luckily the manager took one of the entrees off the bill. 1 star for the margaritas. Will not be coming back"}
