{"text":"The food is incredible but the service is awful. You are not acknowledged at all and the process of getting food is so disorganized. Be prepared to wait for a very long time for your order."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek salad and pickled turnips! I would definitely recommend. Also, they offer delivery which can be a huge help, especially when it's busy inside"}
{"text":"8 people were expected for dinner and welcomed the owner's suggestions.  She quoted $170 with tax and delivery.  After giving the driver a $10 tip, I glanced at the bill and saw an amazing $245.   The owner was not prepared to assist by allowing the return of a dish despite the driver still being on site.  Her attitude was far from good business acumen.  It's unreasonable to expect the customer to loose in every way.  Much of the food was not to my taste and since the guests were offered everything, I was delighted to be left with nothing!   THE OWNER HAD ENSURED FOOD FOR AN ARMY, naturally at my expense !!  This was a truly awful and unfair experience!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, especially their pizza. However, I find that their service can e quite bad. The lines move slowly as they take so much time on one order when it really doesn't require it. I find that if you aren't Jewish, they can be a little harsh but they converse and talk nicely with Jewish people."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is sub par  And there not appreciative of the customers  In fact almost rude"}
{"text":"Falafels are fantastic, so fresh and flavour-packed; they could be the best in the city. Pizza is very good, nice cheese blend and the crust is so crispy and delicious. Breaded cauliflower is good as well!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Tov Li twice a week    In the past month they have not only increased their prices but doubled most of them without any notice to their regular customers.  25% increase would be fair but DOUBLE???? Won't go back.  Not worth the new prices and new smaller portions."}
{"text":"Their food is great tasting and they have great presentation, but their service sucks. Their pizzas are great, good topping choice, especially the zucchini slices, their fries are amazing.   The service is terrible for two reasons, you have to order and pay at one place and pick up in another. The problem lies in the fact you have to go and look at what you want, not always easy as the store is small and usually crowded, and then go back and order.   Then you have to find a seat, sit down and wait to be called. It makes for a complicated ordering arrangement and frequent mixed up orders and long waits."}
{"text":"Wow!  We had Tov-li for a work lunch, it was soo unexpectedly good! The order included a falafel buffet platter, and side greek salad.  All the ingredients were so well flavoured. The pita's are a teeny bit sweet and very soft. The caramelized eggplant had a slight crunch to it, and a deep braised flavour that I have no how idea how to emulate at home (I tried ;). The feta cheese in the greek salad was creamy and smooth. And the falafel...best I've had in the city. Crunchy outside, soft and fluffy inside. There was pickled beets and other veggies. Roasted red pepper....everything was terrific.  I would of never thought of going to a kosher restaurant for good falafel, but hands down their food was excellent. I also never thought I would enjoy a falafel sandwich so much, but I did!! I will be making the trek up to Tov-li's in the future for sure...I checked their online menu, there are individual servings available. I'd love to just get a package of their amazing pita...and the eggplant...and the pickled veggies. Argh I want it all."}
{"text":"Not only does Tov Li have fresh falafel with a toppings bar mimicking that of a middle-eastern market, it also has pizza down to an art. Big slices & whole pizzas are available for eat-in & take-out. But, Tov Li is kosher and vegetarian so don't expect to find any meat on your pizza."}
{"text":"Sloppy Joe of Falafel.  It will fall apart on you ever single time. Slaw and Balls.  You have to pay for other toppings.  Its good if your kosher I guess because there is basically nothing else."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place for lunch often because it was close to my old work place. The service is slow and they are sometimes closed during their business hours which is frustrating and confusing. However, the food is amazing. I love love their falafels. The veggies and hummus they add are beyond delicious. If this review was only about their food, I would give them 5stars."}
{"text":"The falafel at Tov is second to none. Crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Nothing compares...unless you want to head over to Israel for a quick bite. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best kosher pizza Ive had! Sometimes a bit slow - but worth waiting."}
{"text":"Gross food and horrible service. Hurts my stomach Everytime. Never going back. Also rude servers"}
{"text":"Stopped by today to pick up a quick bite and a place to sit outside and get some quiet father's day time.   This is one of the only kosher places in the city with a patio.   The food is decent, the ordering system is messed up but if you want a slice of pizza, a falafel, a shakshuka, or a massive salad then is is your place.   For best service, go during an off peak time and then the system is not that messed up.   Betayvon!"}
{"text":"This is some of the tastiest falafel in the city.  The beautiful falafels are large, meaty and moist.  There are lots of herbs to add to the taste.  They fry the falafel to order, as should always be the case.    They pack the pita generously with lots of falafel balls and different salads.  I like that their salad is slaw-based, which is a departure from the norm.  I usually ask for hummus and fried eggplant.  The pizza in this place is also very good."}
{"text":"Ok, well after reading these 3 dismal reviews, I felt it my duty to alert the world to the sheer goodness of tov-li. First off, being jewish, I can understand how non-jews might find this place a bit too crazy, maybe a bit too agressive or fast paced or whatever, i also cant stand the orthodox people that come here but hey, they are people too and they gotta eat. that said, ordering here is a cinch, you order what you want, you pay, then you take your order over to a lady waiting to cook you up whatever you asked for. not that complicated, idiot. So the breakdown on food: Falafel's= very good, Sandwiches = ive had the tuna melt (with feta cheese) and the tunisian to date which are both great. App's = Fried cauliflower- had it today was pretty awesome, Bourekas (filo/fluff type pastry with spinach and cheese - delicious).   Overall, its an enjoyable place to have a falafel or partake in other israeli food. it \"aint\" fine dining"}
{"text":"Great Falafel and the menu looked great. However, the service was very poor. I was waiting in line to order and the gentleman taking orders accepted orders from 2 other customers who had just walked into the restaurant. I was not acknowledged until I had to make it more obvious that I have been waiting in line for a while. While I was waiting in line, the same gentleman who was taking orders took out his phone to discuss something with a customer/friend...I'm not the type to complain but the service was very poor. I would go back only because the menu had many options and the falafel sandwich was great and I'm sure that my negative experience there may have been due to other factors the gentleman may have been experiencing."}
{"text":"The falafels are amazing!! They have such a nice flavor, service can be bad at some points, when it is late at night. Falafels are a must though."}
