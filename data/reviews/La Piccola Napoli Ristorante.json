{"text":"Awesome lunch today. The most lemony veal al a limone. I love it. I wish I knew about this place years ago. Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I am writing this mostly to remind my neighbourhood that La Piccola Napoli exists, and because our community Facebook site regularly has new visitors who have just moved here, I want them to know, too. When I moved here, a friend told me to visit this little Italian place and I told her I \"never go out for Italian\". But then one night we were feeling like not venturing far from home and we realized we could walk to this place, and then suddenly we were eating there one a week so we could try everything on the menu. Last week I came for lunch, and the place was empty, but the spaghetti aglio e olio was still terrific, and so was the veal marsala (I didn't even think I liked veal until going to LPN.) 

Prices are reflective of the fact that they have been here for over 30 years, and their food is freshly prepared, and they are not paying downtown rent. In short, it's a far less expensive and far more intimate dining experience than Earl's or similar mid-range place. Recommended if you wish to talk to your dining companions, and not if you want to stare at big screen TVs while eating, and not if you are looking for fast food or Olive Garden portions. I'm not sure if I'd send Celiacs here, but in response to my query the waiter assured me that they can accommodate gluten-free diets, so I guess that would be your call to make. All in all, please remember our local family-owned restaurants or they might soon end up where local family-owned bookstores did. 

The proprietor told me that they will close the restaurant with a booking of 50 people for dinner, so that is a handy fact if you are planning an event.

Oh, one more thing. I do not recommend bringing babies or children who cannot reliably behave in a nice restaurant. They will not turn you away, but I also don't think it is the proper environment."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to hold a smallish function or get together consider this restaurant.  There is a sunken area which will accommodate about 30 people.  Good Italian food, friendly service."}
{"text":"We were taken there by friends and could not complain at the time, but had we been there alone I would have sent my meal back. 
The menu is old-fashioned Italian. Nothing wrong with that as such, but not everyone wants pasta. 
The staff were welcoming and friendly, as we would expect since our friends are regulars there. 
The food came in a timely manner - the waiter offered pepper for my appetizer, which I refused but he put on anyway! My main course caprese salad was the real disappointment. Underripe tomatoes, (no excuse for that in late August, rubbery mozzarella instead of creamy, fresh buffalo style; no balsamic and no seasoning!  I looked for salt on the table but alas, none to be found. 
It really wasn't worth the drive so far south. I wouldn't bother to go there again."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience. Busy but staff were super efficient and made it look easy. Calamari was missed on the  menu but we branched out. Everything was served hot and they coordinated things so no one was sitting without anything to eat. Everything was tasty and the family all enjoyed their choices. Will return!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, incredible people, and incredible atmosphere! Love this place. It's great Italian at a very affordable price."}
{"text":"Wow, excellent Italian joint!  I wondered by here last week but appeared to be underdressed so I decided to try again later.  I stopped by tonight after work and was the only customer in the joint for most of the meal...so service was great.  Two things caught my eye so I asked for the proprietor's suggestion.  To my surprise he suggested the cheaper of the two.  The medaglioni was excellent!  The house red was decent and the Caesar salad was delicious.  Unfortunately the salad was way overpriced at $9.  That's some expensive custom dressing.  Almost earned a 5."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant, which kept us well fed at a large business dinner. The veal was tender, the antipasti and shrimp flavorful, and the tiramisu to die for. Plus, very good local beer. If I make it back this way again, I'll definitely visit."}
{"text":"Enjoying this place when we come to Calgary is a tradition. Lovely little place. The gentleman that greets you and probably owns the place is sweet as can be. Clean restaurant. Prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. I had the lasagne last time there. YuM."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Best Italian in Calgary AB
Appetizers top notch.  Wine excellent choices. Menu superb.  Can't miss. Great quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city! It is an Italian restaurant. Small, located next to Boston Pizza in Avenida, across from South Centre. It has a very cozy feel as you walk in the door. On certain nights there is a live musician in the corner playing quietly and enjoyably. The staff is always warm and welcoming. 

The food is always amazing and consistent and I'm fairly certain made from scratch to order. My favourite is the carbonara pasta. I don't think you can get a bad meal here. Sometimes it feels a little slow to get your meal, but I think that is because the quality is so high. It is similar in pricing to chain restaurants and you get a fine dining experience. Perfect for date night! 

We come back time and time again! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
