{"text":"Update: unfortunately this place closed down. Hard to stay a float I guess.  Pity."}
{"text":"A little update to my review. I just learned that they don't use MSG after all.  Also, they don't use any ingredients from the onion family, so they are Dao and Buddhist friendly, too."}
{"text":"I love Malaysian food!  AND I love vegetarian food.  I was quite happy that they opened a new Malaysian restaurant in Toronto -- truth be told, we need more.  My mother and I came here today and we had the nasi lemak and the malaysian curry with mock lamb.  I was very impressed by the malaysian curry - it really hit the spot.  However, the nasi lemak was on a bit of the disappointing side.    With the set lunch, it comes with the lunch and a hot drink (soy drink or tea milk).    Will definitely come back another time just to try the curry laksa!"}
{"text":"Pretty great place if you want vegetarian food that is a bit different from the many traditional Chinese-style veggie restaurants in the area. Menu is a bit easier to navigate than the usual Chinese restaurants with selections ranging from Singaporean, Thai, and Malaysian cuisine. Decor is contemporary and flavours are exotic with a greater variety of spices and flavor profiles.   I prefer this place over Gourmet Vegetarian (the classic spot just across the street) and Lotus Pond (in the Midland/Steeles area). This is primarily because of the more unique flavours and less greasy food. Staff are friendlier as well.   I'm looking forward to trying the pre-order menu items (these are items that require advance ordering for whatever reason). This is maybe the one gripe that I have with the restaurant, because I rarely plan in advance to come here!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here, with rave reviews.  When I finally tried Senwell, I was not disappointed.  The food was really flavourful and wasn't overly saucy.  It was especially nice to find a vegetarian restaurant in a cuisine style that is known for being meat-heavy (and off-limits to vegans).    The staff was very helpful when giving recommendations.  They would alter menu items from vegetarian to vegan if you asked, and then would modify the rest of the order accordingly as well.    The menu is rather large, but has helpful little icons to let you know if the food is spicy or contains eggs or nuts.  It certainly makes the sifting easier if you have aversions to any of the above.   Oh, and a little sidenote - spicy means SPICY (not tabasco sauce spicy, but biting into a chili spicy)"}
{"text":"Senwell Vegetarian Cuisine is a Vegetarian restaurant that serves Singaporean, Malaysian and Thai cuisine.   Lunch Specials are $5.99 which have a good selections of rice dishes, soup noodles or stir-fried noodles, comes with a soup and a choice of beverages.  Curry Laksa extra spicy was spicy! There are 2 kind of noodles mixed in and with some tofu puffs. The mock fish balls were a little depressing...small and tasted funny. The fresh tomato in the soup base was a nice touch!!  Services is really friendly as they just opened and the staffs are willing to please.  I will come back to Senwell with my Hot Yoga Date and some of my vegetarian friends to try out more items on the menu. But it is great that a \"Spicy\" vegetarian restaurant like Senwell open up that has a reasonable price in suburbs!!"}
