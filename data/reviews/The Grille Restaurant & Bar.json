{"text":"Finished the tour de Mississauga and stopped at this restaurant for a big brunch! Everything is great! Love the waffle Grille and the Grille Skillet!"}
{"text":"The past year -service has really declined and the place is really filthy.    Don't bother ordering your eggs soft scrambled or over easy.   They can only make your eggs over-hard (burnt) and inedible."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. We sat on the patio next to some very obnoxious drunks (it was 4pm) I should have known from that point what was in store. I ordered the meatball sandwich with fries and gravy. The sandwich was extremely dry. I requested more sauce which was very watery. The fries were also very dry and the gravy came with a thick layer that had clearly settled over some time. I peeled the layer off the top to reveal gravy that was inedible. Our server was very abrasive and barely took the time to grunt at us. I would avoid this restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"Overall not horrible. The food isn't great.  I had a pork souvlaki on a pita, meat was tough and dry. fries were good.  Friend had a scary burger. The burger came with fried onions, but when served they gave him caramelized onions instead. He asked for fried onions and they said it was the se thing. Anyways they were rather rude about it.  Rarely came by to fill our drinks and took forever to bring us the bill.  Not going back"}
{"text":"ive been here several times before. Everything ive ordered or 'tasted' off of friends' plates has been good. The house caeser dressing is TO DIE FOR. I dont come here without ordering a caeser salad. Also has a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time i came really early at 5am and food was awesome then this time my second time i came close to 11am for their 4.99 breakfast special food was meh. I will only come early morning next time and probably order their 'awesome breakfast'"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning and it truly set the day off on a sour note. Firstly the food is mediocre at best. The home fries were nothing more than a boiled potato thrown into a frying pan for a bit to brown. They were still slimy and moist and the eggs were barely cooked and the bacon hard as steel. Then there was the service. Cold and unpleasant. Wouldn't want to wake up next to this waitress each morning. Never again for this place."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong when you go to the grille. The full rack ribs special are my favorite. I never go home disappointed!  They make great wings as well.  The menu is big, so it's great when you have a big crowd with you.   Everyone is satisfied."}
{"text":"Came again last night and brought some friends with me. Everyone enjoyed the food and the portions are more than generous. We ordered a chicken souvlaki wrap, chicken wings,  lasagna, chicken mushroom penne, red velvet cake and an ice cream Apple Pie. The food was delicious as always. I can't wait to try more items on their menu"}
{"text":"Old-school diner, cool atmosphere and always busy which gives a good buzz. There are two dining rooms and a patio so you should generally always get a seat.   Perfect for breakfast/brunch or late dinner. Menu is huge and so are the portions. Typical diner food in that it won't blow you away, but everything is consistently good. Always found the servers to be very friendly."}
{"text":"I went there today for Breakfast. This place is GROSS! I have no clue why people wait to eat here.   My boyfriend ordered eggs and they came with a really delicious HAIR! Now I know that happens sometimes but when we told the Server about it, she turned into a not-so-nice lady. It was almost as if she was mad at us for telling her - she stopped making eye contact and didn't really seem apologetic. We even acknowledged that we knew it wasn't her fault. She did not handle the situation in a professional manner. We ended up not eating anything and just paid the bill and left.   On top of that, the place seemed super dirty- food everywhere- on the floor and tables. Just an overall greasy feel. For the prices they charge - $8.99 for Pancakes that tasted like they were made from a box and a  nasty fruit cup with old fruit- they should be held to a higher standard for service and cleanliness.   AVOID!"}
{"text":"Love love love coming here for breakfast, try the french toast breakfast. Ive honestly never been disappointed with any thing ive eaten at the grill. We do eat out a lot and I can also say the servers are some of the friendliest ive ever encountered."}
{"text":"The grille is my go-to restaurant on the Queensway. I can never decide what to order because there are so many things I love on the menu. Its open 24 hours, so that's a huge bonus too. The owner Jimmy is a great guy and if you're a regular, sometimes you get free stuff!"}
{"text":"Like a fancier diner... not as sketchy as a dive hole... no it's really not bad at all in there. Cute atmosphere. They get their cheesecakes from The Cheesecake Factory and had sooo many fancy ones. I had the burger with fries, crazy greasy, could eat about half before getting too full. TONS of food. It's not going to knock yer socks off, but it's for sure worth a visit on a rainy hungover kind of day; totally tasty, very filling."}
{"text":"My wife and I have visited this place 4 times. The first time, the service was quite good. The young fellow was polite, prompt and efficient. The food was good. The next 3 times, there will be no more chances for this place by the way, was terrible. One of the waitresses had a mouth like a trucker. The 3 waitresses, all on three different occasions never said thank you after a very non-deserving generous tip. Always looked like we were troubling them. They were completely miserable and disinterested. They won't see our business anymore. Which is a shame because I like supporting small businesses. If management reads any of these reviews, I suggest you talk to your staff and see if there are any issues, because the most positive people in your establishment seem to be your greeters. And that just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"As a diner, I love it. I have visited for breakfast,  lunch, dinner or late night tea for many years. Tea is served in carafes which means it's always hot and plentiful.  Staff are always friendly and the food is consistently tasty,  not over cooked or laden in salt. I am still getting used to the renovation, I feel that some of the warmth and coziness has been lost, however,  still a great go to when looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to The Grill most Saturday mornings. The breakfast is amazing and down the street from our house. We decided to go to The Grill for dinner the other evening for a change. I ordered a Greek salad and I found not one but four small pieces of hair in my salad. I immediately lost my appetite. At first I did not want to complain but my boyfriend stood up for me and informed them that we will be leaving. The manager apologized but had no service recovery skills. We left disappointed and I must say I wish she would have tried harder to keep us as customers. We will never go there again."}
{"text":"I chose The Grill Restaurant on a Wednesday afternoon based on a positive online review. I was in the mood for bacon and eggs. How could I go wrong!   I'll say right off the top that the service was friendly and efficient. The eggs were fine as was the coffee. The bacon, though, was saturated in salt as was the toast in butter. Regrettably, my lasting impression was not entirely a pleasant one. This was due entirely to the din created by the music blaring from an overhead speaker. The stuff was 80s through 90s era pop rock that actually might have appealed to me in an appropriate context. Who the heck wants to hear loud conversation in a diner over a distorted chorus of Hall & Oates, Gloria Estefan, Cindy Lauper and a host of techno rock stuff enhanced with screeching guitar solos that groups at the time would put through fx pedals. I asked the youngish guy who seated me whether the music meant anything to him. Not surprisingly, he said it didn't. He thought the owner probably liked it. I suggested he pass on to the boss that the vast majority of his patrons were ages younger than the two of us. That being the case it might be considerate to either turn down the volume by 50% or, ideally, to simply play bland background stuff that would allow diners to ear their meals in peace while hearing themselves think!"}
{"text":"Got in and the place was ram packed. There was almost no parking. I was 3rd to be seated on a waiting list and I was seated in about 5 mins. The male hostess that greeted me was nice. I ordered the meatlovers skillet with cheddar cheese. The food arrived surprisingly quick! Less than 10 mins. It's was very delicious. The waiter did check in with me periodically, so that i did appreciate. Although the place was a little bit noisey. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"The only thing that is good here is the all day breakfast and the quesadillas and thats about it. The greek food here is horrible! Absolutely no taste. Burgers and your typical food is alright. Probably would go back if it would be the only place open in the area and id be starving to death...."}
{"text":"Meh just about sums up this place. The dining room is clean, the service was good and the food was decent enough. Not great but not gross. I had the Buffalo chicken sandwich which I almost immediately gave up on trying to eat like a sandwich.  The bottom of the bun is too soft and it's really 3 chicken fingers in Buffalo sauce that keep falling out of the bun. The chicken was tasty though with a knife and fork. The coleslaw was also not bad. Not the worst meal I've had but I probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Cold and rubbery, like the service.  Eggs flat, tasteless and tough. Like the service"}
{"text":"One of my favorite diners in Etobicoke. Huge portions, they give you a full pot of coffee at your table and they're open all the time! Very clean and inviting decor. A great bfast or brunch spot for those casual mornings. I usually get the florentine Benedict bfast which comes with 3 poached eggs! I've also had their cheese burger and chicken fingers & poutine- both are just the right amount of greasy when you're feeling for that type of greasy diner fare."}
{"text":"I've been to the Grille a fair number of times, not as my choice, but because it's the type of place my in-laws enjoy.  So dinner out with them is usually here or somewhere comparable.  I don't mind the Grille for brunch.  They do your typical diner-style breakfast.  Bacon, eggs, homefries are all standard and decent.  Serving sizes are HUGE.  Even their French Toast is decent - nothing special, but an okay option for breakfast.  I don't love having dinner there though.  The food is just okay.  I prefer something with a nicer atmosphere and a little more love put into the food. They have a very wide menu, of all the typical comfort foods and family restaurant favourites.  Luckily, their breakfast is All-Day, so I tend to have breakfast for dinner, since it's harder to screw up.  I've seen my dining companions be less satisfied with undercooked meats, soggy foods, etc.  when choosing off the dinner menu.  The atmosphere is that of a long-standing family restaurant.  Nothing special, but nothing awful either.  Not the kind of place I'd choose, but passable for a value-for-the-money meal with the in-laws."}
{"text":"Sometimes the little things can define a relationship for you. When the waitress at The Grille poured my cup of coffee fresh from the thermos carafe -- and then left the entire carafe beside me at the table -- I knew this was going to work out between us.  My breakfasting partner and I arrived mid-morning absolutely starved. We had both fasted for our yearly physicals and had already decided to try The Grille based on a list of recommended Toronto All-Night Breakfast Places I had read a month ago.  Physically, The Grille shows its age in the well worn seats and tables and the eclectic interior decorations. It reminds me of a restaurant attached to a motel, or one of those cheerful places you encounter travelling up north. You know going in that you'll find no hoity toity cuisine here, but you hope to be well fed.  Well, we got what we expected. Our meals were prepared quickly, hot and ample. When my wife's waffle arrived I said, \"whoa! that's big\" and the waitress said, as she slid my Ham and Swiss Skillet in front of me, \"Well yours isn't small, young man.\" That remark made my morning too, as I'm 58. :)  My order, The Skillet, consists of a real cast iron frying pan on a wood block with a layer of home fries, nicely done and crispy, two fried eggs, ham and cheese, and smothered in Hollandaise sauce. A plate of toast with jam as well as a dish of straight-from-the-fridge fruit slices accompanies this. It was almost too much for me, but I soldiered on and enjoyed the entire thing, washed down with all that coffee (which was also excellent).  My wife enjoyed her strawberry waffle, but said she would have been more impressed with real fresh strawberries rather than the compote that was liberally spread over it.  We will certainly be returning to try other breakfast choices from the intimidatingly long menu."}
{"text":"I agree with Tim S.   Mehhhhh.  It's a nice option if you want something other than a chain restaurant.    Ceasar salad is too greasy and limp for me.  We were told the souvlaki platter was the way to go.  Souvlaki platter is huge!  Enough to share between two people.  Meat was a bit dry, but the sides are okay.  Rice, potatoes, greek salad etc.    Get a milkshake if you do go, cold, thick and rich.  They come in its own shaker and they're a perfect side to a burger."}
{"text":"The service was prompt and friendly. Came here with my girlfriends for morning breakfast and catch up. Large amount of food and it was very tasty. Will be back again."}
{"text":"If you want a hefty breakfast, come to this restaurant. It's the only breakfast platter I couldn't finish - IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. It hit the spot, for sure. Staff was also friendly and the place was packed! Worth the 10-15 minute wait in line.   Recommend: \"The Hungry Mofo\""}
{"text":"went here for dinner.  They had a special of Caesar salad, entree and desert.  I ordered the Caesar salad.  When it came, I was surprised to see a plate with romaine lettuce, with about half a teaspoon of Parmesan cheese, and 3 tortilla chips on the top of it.  This was their version of Caesar salad.  No bacon, no croutons, and only a touch of cheese.   When asked for the manager, she defiantly said they didn't believe croutons or bacon were necessary ingredients of any Caesar salad ! No apologies.   Suffice it to say, we got up and left. So much for their \"special\".   Apparently, this restaurant thinks a plate of Romaine lettuce is the same as Caesar salad.  I could have gotten a much better and proper Caesar salad at a fast food place like Wendy's.   This restaurant ranks really low, even by Toronto standards (which is not very high in terms of its restaurants)."}
{"text":"Had brunch with a few friends and our young kids today (second time there) and it was another good experience. It has a mom and pop diner feel, although the restaurant is quite big.   I ordered the steak and eggs (3 large eggs) which came with home fries. The steak was cooked medium (asked for medium rare), and it was pretty tasty for a $16.00 meal. My wife ordered a waffle with fruits and she said it was pretty good/average (meaning it wasn't bad), so overall it was a good meal with the bill to match."}
{"text":"If you are ever west of Toronto and in need of a brunch type meal, do yourself a favour and roll into The Grille.   Now, it is open 24 hrs but we (my family and I) go exclusively for brunch so this review does not cover the lunch or dinner menus.   For me, the three most important components of a good brunch is that the food has to be simple and tasty, the wait staff must be quick and happy (or at least not hung over), and the place needs to be clean.   I hop around from dish to dish every now and then, but when I'm hungry I order the meat lover's skillet. It is a layer of home fries, a layer of scrambled eggs, and then a layer of sausage, bacon, and ham topped with three kinds of cheeses (cheddar, swiss, and mozzarella I think). It is served hot on a skillet and is covered in hollandaise sauce.  Oh, and I always get the coffee because they bring an entire pot and leave it on the table. This excites me for some reason.  Tip: enter through the south entrance, you'll get a better table that way."}
{"text":"The late night restaurant spot for many years. Remember going here after a night with the girls at the club. Food is not 5* but always good"}
{"text":"My friend had been going to The Grille for over 10 years now and though a lot has changed since then the restaurant still maintains it's core roots of big servings at low prices.   The burgers ($9-15) are large,  flavorful and beefy, we usually order it with a side of poutine (+$1.99), which itself is a hefty portion or fries smothered in heaps of gravy and cheese. Other dishes we've tried are the pastas which are very delicious, great size and comes with a basket of garlic bread, the souvlaki dinners ($17), breakfast, and sandwiches .  They never skimp out on any aspect of the meal.  The service is always friendly, like eating at your local diner back in the day.  The decor has been updated within the last few years are it's a cozy modern ambiance.    All in all The Grille is a great place for late night eats, early morning breakfasts and anything in between!"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast joint. Ok value for what you get. Service is good. They have a breakfast special Monday to Friday in the morning that's a pretty good deal. Was sick over the weekend, just nonstop throwing up and couldn't eat anything so this was the first full meal I've had. I regret every second of it. #ItIsWhatItIs"}
{"text":"They did some changes to the restaurant I think the way it looked before was better now it's too bright inside. The staff are very friendly, prices are great but the food quality is not so good. You pay for what you get. The presentation of the food could be improved on, seemed like they rushed when cooking. Also they need a dessert menu!! They told us it's at the front we can either tell you or you can go look. I rather have a menu and think about what I want."}
{"text":"I went here the other day after they re-opened from renovating. The place looks ok - doesn't have the best decor or restaurant feeling but I came to eat.   I had the veggie breakfast skillet that came with a side of fruit salad and toast. It was good lots of flavour but the fruit salad definitely had been sitting in the fridge too long because the fruits were mushy. My friend ordered something different- french toast- which was good and an egg breakfast which was good but nothing special. I ordered a side of peameal bacon and I must say it was the worst I ever tasted. It was white looking and too salty with no flavour- I wouldn't recommend ordering it.  Overall the place is ok but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Finally made it in to this place recently for a late breakfast and loved eery minute of it. It's an old school looking diner, located near the East Mall and The Queensway in Etobicoke.  Walking in you know this place is all business and as been for a long time, there are 2 full sized dining rooms and every seat is filled (and thats after two visits). The staff are extremely cordial and conversational asking how you are, your holidays - even those that aren't your server per se.   Aesthetically it's definitely a no frills kinda joint, but that's ok. You come here for the food and good prices.  Having visited twice now, I've had the pleasure of ordering one of their signature omelets and a skillet. The omelet was a tad overcooked, but the amount of fillings inside more than made up for the browned egg exterior. It's a massive portion and before 11am you get coffee and side toast all in for about $10!   On my second visit I went with the skillet and that too was incredible, potatoes topped with any number of toppings, cheese and then the real kicker - topped with hollandaise sauce. Amazing! Best of all it's served in a real cast iron skillet, not just a baking dish that's tossed under the salamander to melt everything down.  A great feature and one that helps the servers from running around doing coffee top ups is when you order coffee they drop a full carafe on the table for you to server yourself. Appreciated this very much.  End of story, great breakfast/diner spot (they serve lunch and dinner too), that's open 24/7!   Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"I have been going to The Grille for many many years.  It's always been our go to place for breakfast or brunch. And I've always loved it.  They just just recently closed for about a month, and underwent a renovation, it was needed as the decor was feeling worn and tired.  The food was of the same quality as before, a slight increase in prices.    It seems however I will have to find a new breakfast place to go to.  In order to enlarge their seating area, they made their booths much smaller.  We have tall/big boys in our family and it was very uncomfortable sitting in a booth, even with just three of us, and it was the larger option booth.  Our first experience back left us not wanting to go back at all, which really saddens me.   I really wish they would have taken into account that not all people are 5' tall and weigh 100lbs.  Anyone know of a really great breakfast place with room to breathe in South Etobicoke? :/"}
{"text":"This place is Popular with a capital P. We are talking about lines outside the doors and long waits.  This was essentially our second choice as the place we wanted to try had long waits. I wish we had waited. I had the eggs benny and waited and waited. The potato side was poor. The main egg itself was OK I suppose with half decent hollandaise.  The coffee was just awful IMO. Add that to the poor service and long wait one can do a lot better."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become one of my favorites ever since we moved to Toronto.  The staff is very efficient (Brittney, she is awesome), the portions are huge, and great ambiance.  A very cool family restaurant indeed.  I have tried their burgers, ribs, philly cheese, all are worth recommending.  I love the deserts too.  The best part is they service 24/7 so you can drop in anytime, especially late nights."}
{"text":"People actually go here when they're sober??!  I've been here maybe 50+ times and it's always been after last call to get a late night bite to eat. I freaking love the food here even though it's super unhealthy. Even their deserts are awesome (one night I decided to buy like, 6 deserts and take them home haha).   DONNA is the freaking BEST - if you come for a late-night snack/meal, MAKE SURE you sit in her section. What a freaking doll!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is worn, the food was over cooked, and the waitress had a steady stream of mucous dripping off the end of her nose, an observation I made, sadly, only after I ate. I will not be  back."}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Atmosphere is an upscale Denny's with dark wood. Service was good, as good as expected from a family style restaurant. I have only seen the breakfast menu and it is decent but weighted on the unhealthy side. A few healthy options."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast/brunch. It has a nice patio for sunny days. My favourite thing to order here are the breakfast skillets. They are about $12 and come with toast and fruit (usually melons and grapes). I have only tried the meat lovers skillet, but my girlfriends had positive things to say about the vegetable and grille skillet. We also got a side of pancake ($3) to share.   The meat lover's skillet is filled with bacon, sausage, peameal bacon, home fries, egg and cheese, smothered on hollandaise sauce."}
{"text":"Me and my girl went to the grille last friday evening due to after driving by several times and always seemed to have cars out front. Believe me this means absolutely nothing when choosing a place to eat!!!!! We eat out several times a week and usually only eat at places that we know but this time we thought about trying the grille. I was in the mood for a burger and fries so after reading their huge menu (First red flag) lesson learned, the burger was advertised as fresh ground beef served with fresh cut fries LOL, What I received was a totally dried out severly charred piece of meat with zero flavour or seasoning aftere one bite I nearly puked in my mouth with such a bad taste. I patiently waited for the server to come by and asked how everything was so I moved on to the poutine side that I ordered again not as advertised FROZEN FRIES not Fresh with over salted gravy. After I flagged down the host or manager to send my meal back she asked me what else I wanted I said nothing please after be totally turned off but she insisted so I ordered the corned beef sandwich thinking its a safe bet, another dissapoitment stale bread with microwaved re-heated meat and even more frozen fries on top.. Morale of the story avoid this place if you have any standards on eating out and are looking for fresh fast food."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. They recently renovated and it's a lot nicer inside! They're open 24/7 and have all day breakfast which is awesome"}
{"text":"We went to The Grille today for lunch and got \"The Hungry Man\" breakfast, big potions, low price!  This was more than enough for 2 people! One of the people in our group had the stir fry and he said it was great! The meals were delicious and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Pretty good portions for the price. I have come here various times with a bunch of my friends. It is one of our get-together spots as the food is decently priced and the portions are fairly large most of the time. So overall, not my favourite place when it comes to the quality of the food, but a decent place if you are on a budget and like to get a lot of food for a decent/cheaper price range. So there's the good and the bad. Lots of food, decent prices, but also don't expect it to be the most spectacular food. Good diner-esque spot."}
{"text":"Too many drunken night memories here. Great staff, great food (minus an item or two) and you get a bang for your buck too. Their regular burger is huge and it comes with fries. But really though I've been way too drunk here than I had business being. One time I puked and passed out on a parking spot and my friends went ahead and ate without me. But I digress. The grille is good breakfast(all day) through to late night dinner. The service is great. Nice workers and they're cool with customizing orders and correcting mistakes.  Oh and it's not on the menu but order an onion rings poutine. You're welcome."}
{"text":"You ever eat a meal and you are just like \"**** yes\" and you feel a nice sense of accomplishment? I have been coming here for years and I hadn't in a while and completely forgot how thoroughly satisfied I always leave this place. They have all day breakfast AND they're open 24/7...so from a lovely brunch with your mom to a drunken shi*show at 3am this is the best place in town. No bullsh**, you get what you ask for...you want eggs bacon and sausage you get f***ing eggs bacon sausage. That being said, the portions are good (for an average person that means huge) and it doesn't have all the bells and whistles and stupid crap other places do so I wouldn't recommend it for a first date. However, a movie and stuff-your-hole date with an old friend. Perfect. Hungover? Woke up at that shady crappy run down queensway motel for some reason? Get the ceaser and big mofo breakfast meal. There are many many reasons to come on down and mission it out to butt**** nowhere for a damn good meal. Large selection of cakes, got your pastas, your burgers your sandwiches, steaks, all that good sh**! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great late night spot. HUGE portions for the prices. They have daily specials and serve breakfast all day. Service can be inconsistent, though friendly as most are middle aged or senior. Morning patio is a definite highlight."}
{"text":"There is nothing special here than your regular all-day big breakfasts meals. They have a great patio so its a great place to get breakfast on the weekends, however its usually pretty packed.   It is a 24-hour restaurant but I've never actually tried it past 1pm (yes 1pm breakfast!)"}
{"text":"This place is my 'goto' brunch and breakfast joint and I've been a dozen or so times already. It is consistently good and has yet to disappoint. The atmosphere is relaxing and casual and the all day breakfasts and coffee is satisfyingly tasty. Perfect for a casual Sunday brunch with decent portion sizes. 8/10"}
{"text":"This restaurant has two sections both seemingly good, the one in the front when I first walked In looked like a 1950's style restaurant, and a section in the back with waiter service. The wait staff are extremely friendly, and the food very delightful. I had the fish and chips. This came with a salad(I upgraded to Cesar), the salad wasn't what I expected on first look, but the flavour of this salad was amazingly creamy, and in it's simplicity it is healthy. The main course comes with a side of slaw. I squeezed the lemon wedge that comes in the coleslaw on my fish and didn't regret it. The fish is the perfect amount of batter and fish. The fish has a fresh flavour about it, and combined with the batter it makes for one halibu meal. Not forgetting the fries, they paired perfectly with the tartar sauce. I definitely go back to try out some of the many  tasty looking items on the menu."}
{"text":"The Grille - Has been a long time favourite of mine.  Recently (this past year) I have been finding the quality of the food and he services has gone down the hill.  The burgers are huge and meaty but taste gross.  I have been to the Grille probably about 30 times in my life and seeing as I have not been happy the past year I will probably be thinking twice about returning."}
{"text":"The renovations are beautiful.  There seems to be more seating.  It was absolutely packed today for breakfast and we were seated quickly.  The only drawback would be the smaller booth sizes.  A bit disappointing as we had our grandson and getting the booster seat in the booth was a bit of a stretch.  Food hasn't changed (that's a good thing).  Definitely a great place for brunch."}
{"text":"We came here for some late night eats and to pod cast after seeing Wonder woman.   The location itself is very nice, my friends told me it had been renovated since they had been there last, I was quite impressed.  This is a 24hr dinner, with a really nice patio, and a full bar.  The serving sizes were HUGE. So this place really gives good bang for your buck and the Shakes are on point.  They had a decent sized crowd.  Service was good, but the lasagna I ordered at just past midnight was a little cool in a couple spots, though they fixed it right away.  This place is awesome. I definitely have no issue recommending it.  Best diner in Etobicoke I have been too. I will be back and bringing more friends!  Other awesome features, plenty of FREE parking."}
{"text":"I had visited The Grille on one previous occasion and it went like this. Weekday morning. Seated immediately. Waitress approaches. No smile no eye contact. Grunts at me. I order the breakfast special and it's on my table before my coffee. It's mediocre at best. Waitress returns and removes my empty plate. Returns. Throws bill at me. I put down my debit card. She returns with machine. Takes my card and grunts. I pay the bill. It's over in thirty minutes. Brutal experience. I felt violated.   So needless to say I wasn't excited about returning. Friends encourage me to the point of annoyance. I submit.   It's a Busy Sunday. We are warmly greeted and seated within ten minutes. Party includes two children under two and we are seated by a smiling hostess who graciously accommodates our needs. Waitress approaches quickly offering drinks with a huge smile while fawning over babies. So far much better. Food order taken quickly and food arrives hot, fresh and tasty. The table receives the appropriate amount of attention -- not too much and not too little. Much different experience and I'll be back for sure.   Note though that I saw that cranky waitress from past visit. She's still there. Beware."}
{"text":"Do not go if you like your eggs over easy. Have been going to this place for years and they've recently undergone a change. Its decor and menu have changed and they not only are unaccommodating for requests  but they police your food order and change it to what they want to do. I tried to order one of their skillets and requested my eggs be over easy and was told they don't do the skillets with over easy eggs. Scrambled is the only option. So I decided to order their grill sandwich: egg, cheese, and peameal bacon on a biscuit. Again, ordered the egg over easy. I specifically said I wanted the sandwich messy. Was given a sandwich with the egg over medium and was told the cooks won't cook over easy because they don't want people making a mess.    To have a go to breakfast place not accommodate a simple request for over easy eggs is unacceptable. They have lost two long standing customers.   So if you are the type of person who likes your yolks runny, go somewhere else. They're afraid you'll make a mess."}
{"text":"A solid option for a late night bite. I got the Buffalo chicken sandwich, which was delicious and properly spicy. The salad I got as my side was delicious too. The service was good, and the decor was updated and very nice. Booths were roomy enough for two and very comfortable."}
{"text":"Foods cheap and servings are large. Servers are quick and consistent and the place is alright for the money you're paying. I also got a free slice of chocolate cake every now and again. Ive been going there for 3 years now."}
{"text":"Been going there on and off for many years.  Every time I go back I am reminded why it stays in my mind as an option for anything.  They have a large menu and have never been disappointed in anything they have served me.  Now, to be honest, I write reviews for what they are.  If you are expecting this great diner to be some upscale restaurant with designer decor, then walk away, you will be disappointed right off the bat.  However, if you want good food for a fair price, then you have hit the jackpot!  The home fries are made with real potatoes, not fake stuff at other eateries.  Every dish I have had has been made to order and you can tell they make it in the kitchen, not re-heated frozen crap.  I have had many of the entrees, but it is the breakfast I always come back for. cooked to order, and if any mistakes are quick to fix any minor mistakes.  Once, and only once, they slightly over-cooked my steak (medium instead of medium rare), took back the steak, left the rest of the meal with me and brought out a whole new steak breakfast cooked perfectly.  Weekend mornings expect  bit of a wait, as it is very popular for good reason.  Bring your appetite, as portions are generous at very reasonable prices.  Highly recommended!  And I can tell that a few of the reviewers have not eaten there, as they have very conflicting stories, portions too small, portions too huge, prices to low, prices too high, people hating it from the decor and such.  Take it from a local who has eaten in restaurants all over the GTA, this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Huge Portions, Gross Food.  The price-to-food ratio at this place is amazing, But the quality of the food is very low. I would almost go as far as saying it was disgusting. I had the chicken fettuccini alfredo, not sure how you mess that up. The parmesan tasted like dish washing liquid, the chicken was not seasoned AT ALL and undercooked. The pasta noodles were cooked well though... Overall it was a gross dish. As an animal lover, I would not feed it to a dog.  The server we had was inattentive and would toss things onto the table. My partner's burger was burnt AND under cooked :/.  I will never go to this place again and hope to erase it from my memory."}
{"text":"Very very large portions. Been here twice. The poutine was huge, there was no way I could finish it. Also the burger combos had huge amount of fries, I got full really quickly.   I also would like to add that the potatoes did have a funny taste to them, the after taste lingered.   Nobody could argue against the price vs portion at this place. Not a favourite, I felt sick on both occasions when I left.   Service was normal, it's gets really packed and stays that way most of the time.   Would I return? Most likely not."}
{"text":"I've eaten at The Grille many times. Their breakfast alone is worthy of at least 4 stars! Sadly their dinner, the food and the service leave a lot to be desired.  Let's start with waiting to be served for almost 15 minutes. When our server finally did come over, he abrasively commented on all these tables needing service (with no apology) and then said, \"What do you want?\" No hello, nothing. I can live with rude servers, it just means less tip! The part that I cannot live with is my meal. I am gluten free so my options are quite limited. While I should have ordered a salad, I ordered the veggie nachos. To my horror, they came out hard and stuck in clumps to the wax paper they were cooked on. The best part is how obvious it was that they simply microwaved my nachos!  I mean seriously!? I can microwave nachos at home, when I get out to eat I'd like a bit more effort than that.  I honestly thought The Grille was real food, cooked with care. Now I think maybe they are just glorified fast food and don't give a rats ass about anythng except cash in their pocket.  It will be a looooooong time before I ever go back. If I ever go back."}
{"text":"Food look nice, but bland.  Tomato in sandwich not fresh, fruit salad that come with the food not fresh.  Coffee taste best in my meal.  Poor service. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Great diner food for great price!  Too bad they aren't 24hrs anymore."}
{"text":"Line up outside Saturday morning - we asked for bacon done the way we like it and it came out perfect. Waiter super friendly. Finally good diner food without having to go into a greasy dive."}
{"text":"One of my fav place to go for Breakfast in Toronto. Awesome food overall.  Potato pancake is amazing !"}
{"text":"Been coming here for Years .... It's always a great spot for breakfast lunch or dinner  Never a fail ! Great omelettes and pancakes. You have to try there Souvlaki it's huge !  Place is clean , fast and pretty friendly !  Give them a shot you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I think the people that gave this place a poor rating ate somewhere else. We had breakfast here 2 days in a row. The home fries are real, the bacon was perfectly cooked and the potato pancakes are out of this world. The severs were very attentive and the wait time was nil. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"We have given this place multiple chances but they seem to be incapable of cooking eggs. This is the only restaurant where we have to order our eggs over medium and even then 99% of the time the eggs arrive still raw on the inside. We have spoken the the manager and pointed it out to the waitress and the eggs are still consistently undercooked. When my eggs arrived almost raw today we sent them back and they were returned to me dramatically over cooked. Time to find a new breakfast place that knows how to cook eggs."}
{"text":"Decent food, good value, ample portions. Tomatoes and orange slices were fresh."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while as I usually pick peak times when it's lined up and I found the decor tired and dated. So to my surprise and delight I come in on a quiet Monday for dinner. The total Reno looks awesome inside and out - much more classy and open feeling. Delighted they offer 1/2 litres of wine. Great menu and my server is professional, friendly, prompt.  The patio is spotless and clean - nicely spaced tables and good sized  chairs.  My new favourite place and a definite 5 stars"}
{"text":"Solidly average breakfast place.  The quality was never top tier, but in the past at least they would always give you a sizable portion. I feel like that isn't really true anymore."}
{"text":"This place is simple, but good.  24 hours is awesome.  Thursday night special is ribs.    The portions are HUGE, which is awesome.  Basics of ribs, fries, free garlic bread (the garlic bread comes with real chunks of garlic spread on it, yum!), and coleslaw hit the spot.  They do milk shakes which really are like thick shakes too... but it's all good.  Given the relatively cheap prices, and the fact that they give BIG servings, and the fact they aren't another stupid North American chain, I like this place a lot and recommend it.  After 10.30pm the service seems super fast - ribs came in less than 10 mins.  It's simple food, but good."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  The prices are relatively low.. which means the food quality isn't mind blowing & the service is lacking. But if you are meeting a friend for a low key lunch date, a little drunk at 2am looking for a greasy burger or hungover the next day and looking for a big breakfast, The Grille will do just fine.   It's open 24 hours which is wonderful. I've never taken advantage of their midnight dining experience but I couldn't expect that they would cook anything on the menu that you wanted... and if they could they I may question the freshness of their food.   I've ordered the homestyle chili, chicken fingers, greek salad, chicken caesar wrap, and chocolate chip pancakes. All decent dishes except for the greek salad which was disappointing.  Their website is completely misleading. They make it seem like a upscale joint when it really isn't. http://www.thegrille.ca/home.php  Overall, it's okay. Good family spot."}
{"text":"So The Grille delivers exactly the sort of food you might expect. Greasy-spoon diner fare in huge (almost unreasonably so) portions. Nothing here is *great* but it is reliable, particularly if you're in the mood for this kind of thing.  This time around I figured I'd give The Grille's hamburger a chance because who doesn't love a good burger? And the description of the Grille Burger was impossible to pass up: \"A big juicy burger topped with melted cheddar cheese, peameal bacon and sauteed onions.\" Sold!  After a fair amount of time - forgivable, since it was Mother's Day - my hamburger arrived. I was a little confused, however, since I didn't see any cheese or bacon or onions. Instead it was filled with tzatziki sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. A quick check of the menu confirmed that our waiter heard \"Greek Burger\" instead of \"Grille Burger,\" which seems a little questionable if you ask me.  Anyway, the Greek Burger was just okay, I guess. I don't know who thought it was a good idea to drown a burger in tzatziki sauce, but I think there's a reason this isn't a common thing. I had also ordered onion rings on the side - at least the waiter got this part right - and I'll admit they were both plentiful and tasty.  I'll return to the Grille, of course, but next time I'll make sure I enunciate extra hard."}
{"text":"After a long, stressful day of shooting an anti-drug commercial, a friend and myself needed some food to keep us awake on the drive home. Being 3:00AM on Sunday morning, not much was open west of the city where we were shooting, but he recommended a restaurant in the area that he had been to once before and heard good things about as well called The Grill. It is a 24-hour restaurant that carries all day and night breakfast as well as the standard grill foods like ribs and burgers. The place was packed when we arrived, so we had high expectations of quality. With the amount of people there it was surprising that we were able to get a table right away. The location is very large and has enough tables that also brought on a feeling of confidence that we chose the right location for our middle of the night meal.  It took about 10 minutes before a waitress came over to the table to take our order, and she explained that she was unaware that no one else had taken our table. We thought nothing of it and ordered. My friend ordered the breakfast combo with eggs, toast and bacon, and I ordered pancakes with bacon. About 30 minutes later we were brought two plates of ribs and fries. When seeing the very confused looks on our faces the waitress realized that she brought it to the wrong table and hurried off with the plates. Just over 20 minutes later we had still not received our food or any explanation where our food was, so we flagged down the first server we could find and had a manager sent to our table.  A very polite gentleman came to the table (the same one that had seated us when we first arrived) and after mentioning how long we were waiting he looked genuinely concerned and said that he would find out what is going on. Less than 2 minutes later a rather attraction young woman came to the table and introduced herself as the \"service liaison\" and asked in a borderline rude tone what the problem was. We explained the situation again about how long we were waiting and she said that she would go check in the kitchen to find the status of our order. My friend remarked, \"if the food is not here in 6 minutes then we are leaving\", as those 6 minutes would have made it 4:15AM and we just wanted a quick bite and then some sleep. The \"service liaison\" got very defensive at that moment and in an even ruder tone that previously asked, \"are you giving me an ultimatum?\", to which I replied, \"it is more of a statement because more than an hour for eggs and pancakes is kind of ridiculous.\" She got even more upset by this response and started to raise her voice. That was the moment that my friend got up from the booth and walked out with me right behind him.  Having not tried the actual food I didn't feel right giving only 1 star, but that has to be the worst service that I have ever had! Under the right circumstances I might return because the ribs did look and smell great, but it will probably take quite a bit of persuasion to get me to go that far for the experience that I had..."}
{"text":"They have really good Beef Chili  :-) We had the Chili Dinner, Fried Calamari, Omelette with Cheese, Mushrooms and Tomatoes. Food quality are good!!  Nice ambiance, with option for outdoor seating during summer and fall. Good and prompt service. And another good part is, they are open till late, so definitely it's in our shortlist for late night supper."}
{"text":"We sometimes go to The Grille for brunch and it's always awesome.  There is a large patio out front where we always sit as we find it a bit stuffy inside.  Plenty of parking on site.  Food is always excellent - we have our favourites - eggs benny, the hungry man and kids waffles.  Service is also always excellent.  A solid favourite place for brunch!"}
{"text":"I'm a very very big fan of brunch.  I can never wake up early enough for breakfast on the weekend so I love me a meal that will get me to dinner when I finally get out of bed.  This review only focuses on their brunch menu.  If you're ever in the area during brunch, you should stop by here, you'll definitely get your fill.  Pros:  BIG portions Nice atmosphere 24 hours (though this review solely is on the brunch menu)  Cons: Can get quite busy so it could take a while to get a seat. Might take a while for service at times because of busy nature.  Being that this place is in sauga, I would normally not venture here.  I was here for an event later and went on a recommendation by a friend.  Walking in, I was pleasantly delighted with the decor of the place.  Simple and not over the top but definitely classier than your run on the mill grill places.  Seats were nice and confortable and it didn't feel crowded while at our table.    On to the food.  I got the Hungry Man which 4 eggs, any way you like them, bacon, ham, sasauge, home fries, and toast.  When the waitress brought the food over, it was a plate at least 25cm in diameter, I kid you not.  It's a lot of food.  My friends got Eggs benedict, Steak and Eggs and their portions were very generous as well.  When you order coffee and tea, they just give you the entire pot.  I can tell you one thing, I was very full by the end of all that.    The food is cooked well, nothing special but nothing bad either.  Standard for most places.  I love the home fries though, they weren't your usual deep fried variety.  They were from fresh potatoes (I think) and done really nicely.  What sets it apart are the portions.  I don't think I've ever had portions this big.  You come out satisfied, that's for sure!  The prices might be on the high side, (mine was 13.99) but not high enough to keep you away.  We were lucky we came early.  After about 30 minutes, it became very busy and customers were told of 20 minute wait times at least.  Our waitress was probably serving more tables than she could handle so it was tough at times to get a hold of her.  We ended up just going to the cashier for the cheque.  Not a big deal, we knew she was trying her best to get to everyone and that's all we need.    So yeah, if you want a hearty brunch that will totally leave you full to last till dinner, give this place a try.  I won't come as often as I would like because I'm nowhere near this place.  If you are though, I consider you lucky!"}
{"text":"What a shame.  Used to be my regular breakfast spot.  Great Patio, nice staff.....but the  sub-par food and dirty interior make for a not so pleasant dining experience.  The only thing this place has going for it is location."}
{"text":"Taking a course nearby, so meet with friends weekly for dinner.  Food is alright most of the time. Although often one item on plate is hot and other item is cold. Servers apologize but do nothing to correct the problem.   I ordered toasted western sandwich, it was tasty.   Most of staff is pleasant, however the male-waiter has issue with everyone. He is always rushed and impatient. Lacks people skills.   If you can avoid his section, its half the battle won already."}
{"text":"Very abnoxious and arrogant cooks who take the time to come out on the floor and yell at a customer for asking to slightly customize an order rather than just having the waiter say they don't customize their menu in any way possible. Unnecessary drama and disgusting way to speak to anyone. I don't care if you are the head chef or whatever you think you are. Every restaurant should have some basic etiquette when it comes to knowing how to speak to their customers. Don't believe the ratings or reviews because the place looks dirty and the food is below average. Save your money and go literally anywhere else"}
{"text":"You can't really complain for the amount of food you get for the price...but here's my complaints anyway: My medium steak was well done. Vegetables were raw, and potato had a funny tangy taste. Meh"}
{"text":"We came here for a team dinner.  In this area, there are not a lot of restaurants that can accomodate 35-40. This place can and more! I made reservations a week before. Manager was very nice and called me to confirm. We had tables as soon as we walked in. Good selection on the menu with an all day breakfast. They dont accomodate changes in the breakfast menu- one of the coach wanted the breakfast with eggs over easy instead of scrambled, waitress said they couldnt do that... so coach said give me the breakfast without the scrammbled eggs, and i'll take eggs over easy on the side. Dont know why they didnt give the eggs over easy. Also, they kept on forgetting to get me my ice tea. Fish and chips didnt come with tartar sauce, had to ask for it. Cheese burger was a bit burnt underneath. Garlic bread was burnt on the edges.  So overall,  Manager was great with reservation Service was ok Food was ok, could have been better. Good portions for food.  Good ample parking!but its near a traffic light. If you miss the entrance then its hard to u turn back in, especially during rush hour."}
{"text":"I come to this place quite often and usually it's half decent. Last night me and the gf went to the grille again since we haven't been on a long time. We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer, it came out under cooked and the badder was drenched in its own oil. We told the server it was under cooked and soggy so she had the calamari re fried and sent back to use (not a new batch) We also ordered the rack of back ribs which came out undercooked (pink) and cold like it came out of the fridge.  I called the manager an told him what happened. He was very nice and about it and we left without paying to have real ribs and wings at Montana's up the road"}
{"text":"Mehhhhhh. It is a step up from greasy spoon, but not by much. Went there for dinner and sat on the patio. Our server was a bit overwhelmed with the 3 tables she had, ugh.   The spicy buffalo chicken sandwich was a bit odd. No sauce to it really, just this red paste on the chicken fingers and a bit of italian dressing. My friend had the ribs special, and they were super dry...not very saucey either!  I am sure it is decent as an all day breakfast place, but anything else i would stay away from."}
{"text":"12 Years been going here since my clubbing days around 3-4 am and seen this place change over the years.  I now go here during the evening with my wife and daughter which is so nostalgic. All day breakfast is always a great deal.  Try their burgers, Greek platters and chicken wings worth giving a shot.  This place will always be a major staple of Queensway west places to eat.  Worth checking it out at least one time."}
{"text":"This diner is the place to go if you're hungry, unsure what to eat, and not feeling like spending too much! Generous portion sizes. Friendly staff. Great service. Good for families (w/ kids), couples, and friends. I've been coming back for a couple of years now because I can't seem to find burgers that beat their mushroom and Swiss burger. It's a good brunch spot, too."}
{"text":"Good food, good service"}
{"text":"Realistically this place was just never going to be my favourite.   It's kind of an older restaurant, with a very simple (albeit, massive) menu of your classic breakfast fare.   (Terrible) coffee comes by the personal pot, and service is awful at best.   This place is always unbelievably crowded, and I'm not sure why. I'm guessing it must be a neighborhood staple and people just haven't realized how bad it is. Unfortunately, I'll be back - the location between my in-laws and our house makes it too convenient to avoid."}
{"text":"The eggs are good but the homefries are boiled (yuck, not my cup of tea). All of the waitstaff need a lesson in customer service. Prices are a bit high for breakfast, especially compared to Sunset Grill where I can get much better food quality and service. The coffee is absolutely disgusting here, do yourself a favour and order tea or juice."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a xmas eve breakfast here just the other day. Was moderately busy, with plenty of wait staff available.   It was clear that regulars had preferred spots and servers. However, I found that a bit unfair. One server had her entire section filled based on requests. Other servers had just one table each. It was xmas eve, these people were working for their tips, be fair.   The menu had so many amazing options to choose from, but I wanted the potato pancakes. They were delicious, but greasier than I really should have eaten. Ate 'em anyways! The bf got the meatlovers skillet which was also delicious.  Prices were reasonable for the portions received. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly:  The Good: their yummy breakfast skillets, and the mostly cheerful wait staff. The Bad: I made the mistake of ordering dinner, and got a hamburger that was burned black and inedible. They can't do a burger, the simplest diner dish there is? The waitress said the manager would speak with me.  Then came The Ugly: The manager was indignant and belligerent. She said the burger was well done as it always is.  When I said it was burned, she kept angrily arguing with me. With all the 100's of burgers I've had over the years, I can't tell well done from burned? Gimme a break! This nasty woman didn't offer to take the burger off the bill, a discount, or even another meal choice. Although I had previously enjoyed several brunches here, I will never ever come back."}
{"text":"This place sucks! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for the past 4 years and it was always just mediocre. Nothing special typical all day breakfast, you really can't screw up bacon and eggs.  We decided to go for a late lunch one Saturday afternoon, the place was pretty busy. It had just been re opened after closing for renos. We walked in and stood at the door waiting to be greeted. There was no host. We just stood behind a lady that looked like she was waiting to be seated. After 15 minutes of standing like idiots we were greeted. Our server was nice we've had her before. The food just sucks. I ordered the quesadilla and asked for a side of sour cream.... you'd think it would be served with it but no. Was charged $1.50 for it. It was gross. Like just gross. The chicken had no flavour and tasted old. It was only chicken cut up in big gross chunks and green pepper and a little bit of cheese. Ew just thinking about it makes me feel sick."}
{"text":"I went with some friends here after a morning workout. The 5 of us found seating relatively quickly for a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the Meatlover's Breakfast Skillet. The portions are HUGE! No way I could finish the whole thing. For $13, it was a lot of food. The skillet was hot, and very tasty. Service was great. They are open 24 hours Friday through Sunday, so its a great place to have a bite, no matter what the time."}
{"text":"I wish I could post a review about food. However sense I sat down with my girlfriend at 9 pm on a Wednesday I still haven't had a chance to try the food. Mind you it is 9:42 as I am writing this. All we ordered was a couple of omelettes. The only reasonable thing I can think of is that they are waiting on the chicken to lay the eggs."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the last 6 months for breakfast. This is The Grille's specialty I think. So why put a booze bar in the corner and try to be a Boston Pizza type establishment. Being all things to all people never works (visit any Boston Pizza. Lame format). It was dreadfully loud today, 80's hits blasting, ice machine churning, staff running around. And my Hungry Man's brekky was not served hot. Is it real ham or a slice of that lunch meat fake ham ? Oh well, it's almost in Mississauga so who cares."}
{"text":"Just came back from the worst service we have ever had.  We ordered before two other tables and didn't get our food until after them.  When I informed the waitress said she will talk to her manager about it.  He offered us a piece of pie to split between the three of us.  ARE YOU KIDDING!!!!  The portions were small which is not the norm.  Considering how long we had to wait to finally get served due to the amount of people there, which we were fine with.  Extremely disappointed and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Thought we would check the newly renovated grille for  breakfast sat out on the patio beautiful day for outside dining.  Ordered the breakfast wrap after about 15 min it arrived looked good tasted the opposite.  No flavour onions were still raw and came filled with cut up breakfast sausage inside the wrap which I failed to read when ordering . Potatoes were unappealing as well,piled on my plate like slop coveted in paprika and who puts a pickle on a breakfast plate.? Coffee was weak and lacking in flavour.  Sorry won't be back   Only positive was a very nice waitress"}
{"text":"Ended up here after the place that I planned to go to closed early. Boy, am I glad I found this place! The food was good, the drinks were good and the service was amazing.   I went on a Sunday afternoon, for brunch and I was not disappointed. I got the upgraded hungry man and it could easily feed two hungry men.  The person I went with got the eggs benny and it was really good. Everything came out hot and exactly the way we ordered it. The only downfalls for the food were the fact that they didn't use peameal for a classic eggs benny, the potatoes were a little bland, and the hollandaise was also a bit bland. The meats that came with the meals were delicious, eggs were perfect and the pancakes were absolutely delicious.   They have a great menu, excellent service and the atmosphere is wonderful. I will definitely be returning to try some non breakfast items from their menu.   I definitely recommend this place. The hours are great too. I can see this spot being great for late night eats."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning. The server was pleasant. We ordered our drinks and breakfast and they came out really quickly. The eggs were cooked well and potatoes were seasoned nicely too. Good spot if you're looking for a place that looks nice on the inside and has a quick turnaround on breakfast food."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a tea and the cup came with lipstick on it. Also the menu's are unclean  (a hair was in the plastic sleeve). The new renovations are nice, but the quality has definitely gone down. This place use to be a great breakfast spot for us, unfortunately we will not return."}
{"text":"over priced for plain food  glad i didn't pay for the meal  the place as well has a general odor thats disgusting"}
