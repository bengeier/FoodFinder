{"text":"It was my first visit here last night. Wanted some good wings but highly dissatisfied. I got the ten wings, half mild and half parm.and garlic. Didn't taste the garlic or parmesan or the sauce. Couldn't get all flats. The wings were tasteless and they were not jumbo as advertised. Took me years to try this place, won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after a movie with no expectations. I only knew I was not in a mood for pizza or Chinese.
Amber, our server, could not have been nicer, she was pleasant and was quite attentive to our needs and desires.
We only had appetizers this visit: garlic Parmesan wings and chicken quesadillas. Both were delicious and plentiful.
The ambience made it very comfortable for us, with lots of TVs and two pool tables.
The only negative was that they could have had a larger selection of craft tap beer. No matter. I would return and wholly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been to Russells many many times and have spent a lot of money there BUT will NOT go back after last night....My girl friend and I went for dinner around 9 30 and was met rudely at the door by a guy that said ya'll got ID?  I said I am 56 years old and have all this gray hair seriously?  I told him I have been there many times he said I don't care no ID You ain't coming in.  SO I WILL NEVER step foot in there again.  Seriously?  If this is the direction new management is going I will tell everyone where I work the same thing, which by the way we used to bring about 10 of us there after work but that will change as well...  Good luck with your new Door Guy you have gotten the last of my money"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in around 7pm so we could grab a bite before hitting an 8:15 movie across the street.  We ordered a couple of beers and two sandwiches and the beers came out quickly, followed by the food about 10 minutes later.  That's where everything fell to pieces.

I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap (no onions) but they brought me some other beef wrap full of onions.  Since our waitresss never stopped back to see how everything was, I asked another girl to send her out for me.  Needless to say they offered apologies, said a new order was in and it would be out in a few minutes.  She also indicated my sandwich \"would be taken care of\".  At least 10 minutes later...no waitress and no food so my girlfriend went to find someone to ask.  Our waitress then came over and said it would be less than a minute.  5-10 minutes later...still no food.

Long story short, at 7:55 she brought my food and I asked her for the bill as we had to leave to catch the movie.  Guess what?  They charged me for my sandwich, it took almost an hour to get a wrap, we missed the movie and I had to pay for the sandwich!

I'd go to Burger King before I'd go here again or suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food. This is a comfortable neighborhood bar and I see my neighbors from sardis woods hanging out often. Can't wait for football season to start."}
{"text":"This is barely a pub and it's not much of a grill either. The wings are only served in weird counts of ten. I don't know whether it's a dumb decision or whether they just want you to over-order. They don't come with fries or anything. The servers weren't consistent and only came to the table to take the order, deliver the food, and get the check. Not once did they fill my girlfriend's or my drink so it was a waste to order anything but water. We are in the south so there are plenty of good local sports bars, but this place is a total waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight and believe me I'm not impressed. First off the music was terrible, the appetizer I ordered was sent out burnt , unexceptable !!! Clearly you could see that the philly egg roll was burnt and they sent it out anyway. Bad quality and showed a lack of care as well. The drinks the bartender made for me were way to strong and I had to ask for more juice . On top of that the second drink she mad was still too strong, she proceded to put a straw in my drink to taste it. Inappropriate and it's unsanitary ! I will not be back to say the least !"}
{"text":"I am trying to figure out why  all of the reviews are so low. I went to Russell's for the first time with a friend of mine the day before the superbowl. There was a band performing and a pretty decent crowd. The band was pretty good, there were people dancing, playing pool etc. The waitress that was I assigned was  \"On It\". She did a pretty good job helping us since we were first timers as far as explaining the food and drink specials. The atmosphere was more of a older crowd which I was fine with. The food that I order was pretty good and I even order food to-go. I had a pretty good time and would come again."}
{"text":"Visited Russells for the first time with a friend of mine for a Tuesday lunch. We were in and out within an hour and both spent less than $10, including tip (awesome,  apparently new,  lunch specials.  First impression was,  holy shit is this girl running the whole bar by herself?  Turns out she was; host,  bartender,  server and cook for all I knew.  So to say the least,  while obvisioulsy understaffed, I was pleased with service.  The food was good,  checked a lot of boxes; hot,  flavorful and filing.  I had the Buffalo chicken wrap and my friend had the pulled chicken bbq sandwich, fries were great to me.  Overall happy with the experience,  with come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Been here many many many times. We only came for the wings and fried mushrooms.  Sadly , they've discontinued the mushrooms so there's no reason to ever come back."}
{"text":"Alright folks- this place could've been better with service. Period.
I was enjoying a few drinks outside and had the bartender(white female wavy blondish hair) persistently asking for a lighter from me and my group of friends, she displayed herself as an \"attention whore\" - and like I said MORE than once. Thought she was cute and we really didnt care so she was offended.  Said something under her breath toward my friends and I... 
It was annoying and doesnt look good for the business.  Didnt eat food here- dont know if I would really want to either, I was accompanied outside by a trash talking thug and a drunk bully. Simply didnt enjoy the people that were spending their evening here or the people working for the place. However- the drinks were on a good price!
I wont be rushing back here."}
{"text":"There's literally no one in the restaurant and it took 25 minutes to get a beer. When it got to the table it was warm. Ordered wings it too an hour to arrive. No napkins or to go boxes. The waitress was slow and unprepared. The new management charges extra for ranch and bleu cheese dip for the wings. Horrible experience!! I would not visit again even if they were giving away free food."}
{"text":"The rudest waitress I've ever encountered. Placed my order at 5:05 and part of it arrived at 5:37 and it was lukewarm.  Rather than the waitress being apologetic and owning the delay, she insisted that problem is because food is cooked to order. I will never return!!!!"}
{"text":"I really believe the only review above very bad must be an owner or employee , tried to get a drink the first time I visited , after 30 minutes I left , Russels contacted me wanting me to try again , we texted back and forth , went after seeing a promotion on Facebook for NBA finals , the bar was packed and I sat at a table , management told me on slow nights they only had 2 server , the bartender was the bartender , server , waitstaff , the NBA finals let me remind you !!!! Seemed if you are not a regular at the bar they don't want your business , if you want disrespect , terrible service , management treating you like crap  This is the place to go , they wonder why there slow lol  
I went down the street to Buffalo Wild Wings and they were packed , Russels is Dark , Dirty and it smells like rotten beer  and mold !!
Just Sayin !"}
{"text":"If you are not a bar rat & sit at the Their bar every day, forget about getting waited on.   They absolutely do not care when you sit in the booths.  No one will wait on you.      Two times now, we picked up our own food from the kitchen.    

The staff hangs out at the bar instead of waiting on customers.   They will sit and finish their own meal before they even come to wait on you.  Every time I've been in there, the staff is eating at the end of the bar.   I swear the guy bartender is intoxicated half the time while he is working."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent for your run of the mill bar. Interesting food items that you don't expect to see which was refreshing. Aside from that, the service was an absolute joke. Our group of 10 received barely any service and took almost an hour to get our food, despite being literally the only table at the restaurant. Of course, I would probably provide bad service too if I forced any large group to tip a mandatory 28% on the bill. Big parties beware. Oh and the dress code is laughable. It's a dive bar, not a five star restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok...so I've been coming here for a couple of years. There has been huge changes - and at the time I would say these changes would give this place a 5....I have a friend who is a retired cop who thought I was crazy bringing them in here but they liked the changes and food was fresh and good, riff raff down to a minimum, everyone was happy and all was fun. Well a bad thing happened and Russell passed. I happened to come here the day everyone way celebrating his life. It was a sad day but I wanted to keep coming and support the business. Been here a couple of times since- and I had to finally say something. I'm not sure what's happening but first- I ordered wings and saw Kens blue cheese dressing on my plate. What? This place makes their own. Nooooooo....my friend got spinach dip.....it was frozen in the middle. What???? And the Caesar salad was loaded with Salt....then I got harassed by some drunk talking about I'm not sure what...and then the fish tank is blowing air....that will kill them...I hope Russell isn't looking down and crying right now."}
{"text":"The smoked wings tasted like they were cooked over a garbage fire.  Awful, acrid and chewy.  Wife's 'prime rib' sandwich was offensive to the word 'beef', let alone prime rib.  Thin grey chunk of leather. Just call it a steak sandwich, at least then it's not a total farce.  The beer, however was fresh and our waitress was nice, but pretty sure she knew the food sucked, didn't even offer a box for my dozen uneaten tail pipe fume flavored wings."}
{"text":"I have been to Russell's a dozen or so times, and have had a far different experience then previous . My fiance and I live in Stonehaven off Monroe, so Russell's is a stone's throw away.  I have found the service to be excellent.  My favorite is Taylor who always remembers our names. The bartenders are super friendly and always smiling ( unlike the ones at boardwalk billys who act like serving us is a chore.)  The food is completely underrated.  I consider myself a foodie and my fiance is a chef.  I think the garlic parm wings are among the best in Charlotte.  They are always crispy and flavorful.  I also enjoy the ceaser salad.  But if you order food, you have to get the Philly roll app.  It is AMAZING!  I've never had anything like it.
The only thing I would change is the beer selection.  I would prefer going to Russell's on Saturday night but boardwalk billys has 2 or 3 dollar craft beers.  Also, sometimes the music is kind of lame.  Other then that,  I  believe Russell's will grow in popularity once people realize how good the food is."}
{"text":"Some of the worst take out I have had. We had to wait and extra 25 mins because food was not ready when they said it would. Then when got it home all of the cheese in the mozzarella sticks was out of the stick. Fried way to long! Also got crab rangoon and spinach and artichoke dip they were blahhh. No real taste.  Also got the crab cakes..Don't waste your time they where awlful! Got onion rings as my side and of course they were way over cooked! Overall this was a horrible experience and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for karaoke. My gf invited me out. This place would typically be too far for me but since I was invited I decided to check it out. It's conveniently located on the corner of a strip mall that houses a large grocery chain and some other stores. Compared to where I normally go this place was packed with a decent mixture of people. They do have pool table which is hard to come by no a days at \"sports bars\"..they had several televisions. I was able to only sample the late night menu because I came in after midnight. I ordered the fried wings (lemon pepper), they were good, had a nice zing to them. I also tried the potato skins, no complaints there. Good drink specials too. My only complaint is that it seemed as though they didn't have enough staff? Even though it was late night, it seemed like there was only one waitress for all the tables which meant slow service and two bartenders. I sat at a table with a group of people I didn't know and the waitress charged 20% gratuity, because it was a table of 5 or more. Which I get it if we were actually together, but when seating is limited you sit where you can, so I'd just advise everyone to let the waitress know how many is actually in your party. I probably won't return because it's like 30m away from where I live, but if you're in the area check them out and they're open until 2am. The host for karaoke had a decent mixture of music so thumbs up to him, and I like how the words were on the tv screen so those in the crowd could follow along/sing with others."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place a two is the food is what I expected which is great I guess. The service is absolutely horrible I finally got tired of waiting for beer and just went to the bar to get it to find my waitress playing games on the computer thing at the bar. Oh and by the way I was ordering buckets so she didn't have to check that often. Hate to keep saying oh but oh I ordered a bucket 3 times before she finally brought it. Sadly enough I've been here before and the service was no better"}
{"text":"Waitstaff sucked... they are in the back smoking cigarettes... even when she took our order she had phone and box of Newport's... smh... I'm almost scared to see what the food is like.. I will update my review"}
{"text":"Tried Russell's Pub for the first time last night. The chicken tenders were great! The service was fast and friendly. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The only reason this hidden little gem doesn't get a 5 start rating is their beer selection.  So generic my husband drank a water!  
We ordered wings, half hot, half hot honey.  Not a huge difference between the flavors and not real spicy, but nicely crisped.  The blue cheese dressing tasted like a homemade dressing.  We then ordered the BBQ bacon sliders with fries.  Obviously hand pattied on a very soft, yummy bun.  The fries were perfectly crispy.
Welcome to our lineup Russell's!!!  We'll be seeing you again soon.  Sooner if you get a better beer selection."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to visit when in N. Carolina. Every  and I mean EVERY employee here is friendly, courteous, just down right AWESOME. And the icing on the cake is the food. I loved the chili, Cesar salad and wings. French fries and chicken Cesar wrap was enjoyed by my friend. All good. :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would.  It used to be a cool spot when it was Five Steps Two, but has continued to go down hill over time.  Went in to grab beers and some apps, the bartender came over and greeted us and we ordered beers and waters.  We asked about the happy hour specials that were named \"small bites.\"  Our bartender said that she was pretty sure they were shots and not food.  One, why didn't she know exactly what they were, and second, Huh?  Since when are small bites shots?  LOL ok.  We got our beers and mine needed a lime to go with it.  I asked if they had some and was told yes, but they weren't cut yet.  I had to wait about 10 mins before I could drink mine due to waiting on cut limes.  (It was about 6pm, there were only about 4 other customers in the bar, so it wasn't like they were slammed or anything.). We were waiting to hear from a friend to have dinner somewhere else but were hungry so we decided to go out on a limb and try an appetizer, given that what we saw and experienced was already a little worrisome.  When we asked our bartender if they had fried pickles, she said I'm not sure, let me go ask.  She literally had to ask if there were fried pickles to order.  She came back and said yes, she could order them for us.  We get our fried pickles, and I asked for another beer.  I also asked for some extra ranch dressing to go with our pickles at the same time.  So she goes to ring in my beer, and rings in the ranch for the chef as well so she can pick it up from the window.  She brings back our ranch, and my beer is still visibly empty, but instead of going to get my beer, she goes to sit down at a high top and starts eating a container full of food.  We try our pickles and they were so salty, we felt like we were going to melt away like a snail from all the saltiness!  We finally have enough of this depressing environment, because she never returned to our table, so we had to go to the bar (from our high top we sat at) and ask the other person that was in the bar for our tab.  We get the tab and my beer I never received was included and we had to ask for it to be taken off.  We were also charged .50 extra for ranch!  But not before the other bartender person verified that we never received the last beer from our bartender, but she had the audacity to ask if we still wanted it 30 minutes later.  I hate writing bad reviews, because I want so bad to be able to give praises to deserving places so that others can benefit from mine, but this experience was just way too bad to not notate.  I hope this was the exception rather than the rule, but sadly, I'm pretty sure it isn't.  I don't live nearby anymore, so i probably won't be going there ever again, but it used to be a cool spot when I did and nostalgic when I've gone back, since moving away. But I think I'm cured of that now lol."}
{"text":"The food was great! I would recommend this as a stop for anyone passing through. 

Very pleased with all. There was a bit of a wait, and the waitress seemed overwhelmed. Our table ordered the Carolina burger, buffalo chicken wrap, Texas burger, two American burgers, and honey chicken sandwich. Everything came out great. The chili was good on the Carolina burger and really made the whole thing, the chicken wrap was good but the person that ordered the wrap said she thought the burgers were better and would advise against the wrap, the regular American burgers were great and had all the fixings, Texas burger was great but needed more Barbecue sauce, and the honey chicken sandwich was awesome."}
{"text":"On September 10, 2017, my group & I went to Russell's to watch a football game with in the VIP ROOM and the night from hell began: one of the two big screen TVs was not working, the other was in Black & White (like the '70s) instead of color. We were told one of the servers had just been fired. There was only one bartender, Kaye, a very nice person working in this hell hole, only one server for the whole place, LuLu, an egregious & disrespectful young lady, one cook who had only been working for a few days there, he kept messing up the food orders and some of the food was burnt! They were running out of liquor.. there was a long, long wait to get this messed up food.We were advised to go to the bar to order our food & drinks, because they were short handed..

Then, a fight breaks out when another bartender who started helping Kaye, the asst. mgr., when he attempted to stop a patron ( who wasn't with us) who didn't pay his tab.. another employee came in yelling that \"they were fighting outside, call 9-1-1!\" , the cook left the kitchen to help out the one bartender, Kaye runs outside to break up the fight, as well as rude @$$ server, LuLu, who also runs outt..leaving no staff members, some one could have run away with the few bottles that was left or the few coins left in the register. The police never arrived, Kaye comes in and apologizes, but doesn't offer any discounts or comps at least a round of drinks..but had the nerve to charge a gratuity on a bottle of beer! 

After the free, no pay per view fight, the whole place was practically empty. People left before the fight because of the bad service and the rest fled when the fight occurred. 

Monica, the manager is probably the most unprofessional of all the members of that staff..she and LuLu seemed to not like their jobs or people, the wrong place to work in the restaurant industry. Monica is an unprofessional, self absorbed, egregious and obtrusive young lady who is leading that restaurant to bankruptcy. By the way, on the way out of this House of horrors, we noticed the sanitation grade score was a 93...what the heck!
Do not ever, ever, ever, ever go to Russell's! I wouldn't take my enemy's dog there to eat.

You can NOT make this stuff up, it's like a National Lampoon Adventure movie, I was looking for Chevy Chase the whole time that I was there."}
{"text":"Went to Russell's on a Sunday evening because every place else was packed. The atmosphere is your  typical dimly lighted bar and grill with a few TVs tuned to sports. The service was good. 

I put a lot of stock in a restaurant's iced tea because it indicates how frequently the container is cleaned. Russell's was passable but starting to turn.

The cheese fries were smothered in what I would describe as what you would expect for nachos at a stadium; you know pumped warm Velveeta, but in this case slightly off flavor. Stay away from them. 

My wife had a half rack of ribs and rated them 3.5 out of 5. My son's Hangover Burger was cooked to near dryness, but it was still pretty good. I had a cheese steak. Lots of meat with greasy grilled onions. Again, the meat was over cooked and it had a couple of spots of tough grizzle. The onion rings are of the kind you would buy frozen at the grocery store.

I find the place a bit over priced given the mediocre quality."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my family. We had 7 people and always know that many will be a wait. We got there and luckily it was pretty empty for 5pm. Now I know why.  We waited for 30 minutes before our drink orders were taken the another 15 before we even got the drinks. About 30 minutes later a second waiter came over to take our order because the first one left without a word. We waited almost 2 hours before our food arrived and it was very typical bar food. It was decent but the service will be the reason we never return. Only reason for 2 stars was the food was ok."}
{"text":"They served us Fish n Chips and they gave us fries. And the server was like \"do you want chips?\" and we said \"yes\" and the server goes \"im just kidding.\" They disrespect the customer and they don't even know how to deal with the coupon that we purchased online. So I had to figure out how to use it. Also I ordered the build your own burger, and I chooses onion and bacon on it, and they served me with raw onion not even heated, and I had to ask for bacon again b/c the server didn't serve us. And bacon was so greasy and taste so bad. I dont recommend this restaurant. The food was really bad and server was the worst."}
{"text":"First visit today,  will be the last.  Came in for take out.  Took 10 minutes to get a beer.  Ordered wings and  fried chicken sandwhich (plain).  Waitress said just chicken and bun?  Yes.  First time came with cheese.  Second time it was grilled.  By now wings are cold.  Took my card at first delivery.  Asked to speak to manager but he was too busy sitting at the bar.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Well I was very disappointed the last time I visited this place. I am very big on leaving the proper reviews and this place is unorganized. Waitresses didn't get to my table until 10 minutes after I got in and I had to chase her down to get to me. I had a pickup order which had been sitting at the bar since I came in, however no one explained that you have to go up to the bar to pick up your food. Then they missed one of my wings out of my order. The price was to high for any wings to be missing. I doubt I'll be back because I see once restaurants gets comfortable their quality of service and food goes down. Sad because I stay a couple minutes away but can't because of the service. You can try it if you like!"}
{"text":"To start, the \"dress code\" is blatantly racist:

\"NO! Extra long T-shirts
NO! White T-shirts
NO! Excessively baggy jeans
NO! Head gear
NO! Construction boots
All jewelry must be tucked in 
Pants must be pulled up\"

And as if this weren't enough to keep you from patronizing the establishment, here are a few more reasons:

The food was sub-par
The staff was lazy and rude (check out their replies on some of these reviews!) 
The orders came out WRONG
There is an automatic gratuity for groups incentivizing poor service.

Stay far, far away!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We go on a weeknight and service is great! You will like the music if you grew up in the 80's!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch on the patio - very good service, excellent food and a nice patio.

Wings were excellent - burgers and wraps were also great."}
{"text":"Pool tables, dartboard, poker tables, lots of tv's, and good food.

The Philly steak and cheese was really really good. The bread was soft although I prefer a little bit crusty. The macaroni and cheese is to die for. Ample portions. Totally worth the price tag. We'll def be here again...maybe meet some friends!

We were here on a Thursday night. And there were about 20 people here. 

I will say that the first bottled beer we had to send back bc it had been warmed over but they did it w/no problem... And they told us that they had a certain type of beer in stock but they really didn't. Then had to change our order...when the tab came we had 5 beers on there when we only ordered 3. Straightened it out immediately and paid the correct amount. Additionally, the water tastes like it had soap in it. We love water and drink lots of it so I know we weren't being super sensitive about it, but it was totally noticeable."}
{"text":"Mixed review here.

Other reviewers are right. The service is poor. They seem surprised when anyone wants to eat in the place. I basically have to go to the bar for a refill, get napkins or pay the bill. Way more misses than hits. And frankly - I don't think they care.

However, the food (when it comes) is actually good. I've had the chicken, wraps, burgers, fish -- all pretty solid. The fries are good and they give you plenty. I would take this food over many other places.

If they could fix the service issue - I would recommend this place. Right now, I can't."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat her often. At first we played Pool for free. Now they charge $6 to play so we don't enjoy that feature that originally drew us in. We've always had a pleasant experience with the same bar tender/server lady. Our most recent visit was not enjoyable. We had an event to be at and limited time to order and dine in. A new server couldn't answer any questions about the menu. He ordered the Philly and I ordered beef brisket sandwich. Food came back - I received a black and blue burger. I asked the server \"This is brisket ?\" She looked long and responded \"uh yes I think so\" I obviously knew this was not brisket and was pondered as to why she even brought it to the table when I never ordered it. She returned it and renewed my order. By then my husband was done eating and I watched him eat for 15min while I had no food . A manager delivered my order and apologized that I had to watch him eat. The server was eating as she was attending to our table and that's why she was unfocused she input the incorret order. They took the brisket off the bill. The server admitted that she wasn't paying attention to detail of what she was doing. The issue for me is that this interfered with our plans for the day. We were late to our event and I waited over hour and 20min to eat. We might give them one more shot but will request service from the management for lack of care to our table from this experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we drove by it and it looked interesting. 
We both got the Texas burger.
Oh. My. Gosh.
Definitely one of the top 5 best burgers I have ever had.
BBQ sauce, jalepenos, onion rings. Perfection. It was cooked perfectly, and made very well.
We will be back."}
