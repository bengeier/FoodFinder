{"text":"Serious question:  Have you guys stopped caring?  It's supposed to be an upscale experience, yes?  Then why are the theaters not cleaned in a timely fashion?  And then, when you finally get to go into the theater why are they STILL dirty from the last movie (straw wrappers, popcorn, misc everything everywhere)?  And why, when we arrived a 1/2 hr ahead of schedule so we could get drinks, food, etc.. we now have to order During the previews because the theater wasn't ready and our sever completely skipped our row.    Dear AMC Esplanade: Step Up Your Game!     We gave you another shot, but for the money we end up spending I think we'll just go to the IPic instead."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our date night at the Esplanade for the first time since it's renovation.  I was surprised at the changes made to the place.  Gone was the old ticket booth, and the lobby/concession stand area was turned into a bar lounge type atmosphere.  Looked like a cool spot to hang out and wait for your movie if you were early, or even to it and chat, if on a date, after the movie.  You can purchase your tickets at the automated machines, or buy/pick them up inside at Guest Services.    The employees were very cordial as we passed them on our way to our seats inside the theater.  We decided on the Cinema Suites, since it was 21&over.  We were impressed with the layout, and the very comfortable seats that recline.  Our server was very nice and informative.  I was surprised when she was entering our order into her pad, the other servers were bring our drinks and appetizers.  WOW!  That's faster and more impressive than a restaurant.    I had the sirloin tips and mashed potato's, and my wife had the fried shrimp with fries.  I can't comment on any mixed drinks, (another reviewer complained of watered down drinks) mainly because we had wine.   All in all, it was ok.  Kinda like food at an Applebee's, or Chili's.  Nothing to go crazy about, mediocre, and over priced, but it WAS a MOVIE THEATER.  I mean, It's not a Michelin Star restaurant.  I don't care that it is in the Biltmore area.  The thing that annoyed us the most were the 2 pompous couple's we sat between.  They constantly complained about something.  Mostly their refills.  The waitress explains to you, should you need something, PUSH the call button.  They never did.  They expected someone to come by.  The point of the call button is to minimize the wait staff running around disturbing patrons who are watching the movie.    This is the main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. They were really annoying.   It's like this.......You are at a THEATER that serves food and drinks.  Not at a Fancy restaurant that shows a movie.  You're paying for the comfort and experience of being able to relax, enjoy a drink or dinner, all while watching a movie.  Bottom line, Food was ok, a little over priced, so watch what or how much, you order.  If you like to drink, have a beer, wine, or straight drink, if you are so worried of getting it watered down.  The employees from beginning to end were excellent.  And the over all experience was very enjoyable and fun.  We would definitely do it again real soon."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I had my doubts because of a prior experience. Years ago I went to Farelli's Cinema Supper Club in Scottsdale and it wasn't great. Bad food, seating wasn't ideal and just not a good experience overall. But wow. As soon as I walked into the newly remodeled AMC 14 I was impressed. A full bar where the concession stand use to be and nice tables and seating filled the lobby. The vibe was much more adult and cool right from the start. My friend pre-purchased tickets for six of us. We had our own row and when I sat down in the super comfy recliner I was in heaven! Great menu selection and the drinks were good. Got a cosmo and it was very good. Not the best I've ever had but really good. I honestly didn't expect the drinks to be drinkable. Not at a movie theater but I was pleasantly surprised.  I got a Swiss mushroom cheeseburger and it was delicious. A few nice touches really made this an extra nice experience: while we waited for our drinks and food, we all got a cup of chocolate covered popcorn and when we left the theater, an employee was holding a tray of mint chocolate Ghiradelli squares. Nice touch. We had a few issues with the credit cards being charged properly and the bills mixed up but the management fixed things right away and gave re-admit passes without question. Nice service. This may not be for everyone if you just want your run of the mill popcorn, soda and movie but it's a fun treat to go here. I highly recommend it and will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Expensive. Really disappointed. I ordered \"blackened chicken Alfredo\" and it was disgusting. Chicken was raw! Pasta overcooked and almost no Alfredo and very unsalted. I am not going back there again. Also we have been waiting to order food for 20 minutes and nobody came, so we had to summon the waiter by pushing the assistance button."}
{"text":"A few things I heart about this theater is:  1) Ability to purchase tickets online, which allows you to reserve seats & avoid lines so you can show up last minute. 2) Comfy seats and some recline...yummy!  3) Having a server  Areas needing improvement:  1) The food! Oh gosh, if you're going to sell this place as a dine in theater amp it up AMC! In this case simple is better. Go with the classic movie foods: hotdogs, pretzels, roasted almond. Just amp up the quality to differentiate yourselves from the other movie theaters. Make them gourmet classics. Even Ipic got that right!   All in all it's a fun way to watch a movie, convenient & comfortable but the food makes me miss the classic movie theaters."}
{"text":"It's a nice theatre, with comfortable reclining seats. There is unfortunately one major design flaw. When you recline even slightly, the panel in front of you blocks the bottom 1/4th of the screen. So I didn't recline the whole movie which defeats the purpose. Still better than a regular theatre, but not as nice as the ipic due to the design flaw."}
{"text":"Has potential but...  Beer I ordered wasn't cold and the appetizer we ordered never arrived. Makes paying attention to the movie difficult when you're wondering what's up with the service and for the price you're paying this shouldn't happen."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check out this dine and view theater last weekend for the debut of TED. This AMC was remodeled into a dine and drink type of theater. They have certain theaters that are called \"Fork and Screen\" and the other \"Cinema Suites\". Cinema suites have recliner chairs and are 21 and up, less seats. Fork and Screen are cushy seats but no reclining. We went with the Fork and Screen as that was all that was available. We arrived early and had a drink at MacGuffins Bar inside the lobby. Ryan had a PBJ drink that tasted like a PBJ sandwich. I had a Southern Slam - Southern Comfort, Amaretto and Sour Apple Pucker shaken with orange juice. Quite yummy and strong. I may have had several..... We headed into the theater. The seats were setup with 2 4 2 across the theater. We were able to get 2 seats on the right about 3 rows up. They have tables that slide out in front of you for dining. Full silverware setting, side table area for drinks, etc. Our server was quite attentive and wasn't annoying. We never had to press our button to call him. He had water brought immediately. We started with Parmesan Fries which were quite tasty, Deep-fried until crispy and tossed with our seasoned salt, Parmesan cheese blend and Italian flat leaf parsley. Served with ketchup and garlic basil aioli. Ryan ordered the fish and chips meal. He said it was nothing special and was good for what it was. I had the Bruschetta Shrimp Pasta - Pan-seared jumbo shrimp tossed in zesty seasoning with corkscrew pasta and creamy sun dried tomato sauce, and sprinkled with fresh tomato and basil bruschetta. The flavor was great. My only criticism is that I wish it would have had more shrimp. But over all it was a great experience. I want to go back and try other entrees. They are about average as far as costs. Our entrees ran 12-14 dollars each.  I would suggest checking this place out for sure! Great date night or a good girls/guys night out! They have underground parking and do validate."}
{"text":"We were so excited to check out this theater!! Comfy seats, dinner, and a movie?! Sounds great! It was ok. Movie was great! Seats were more comfy than typical theater seats but were made of some material that you kind of stick to...which in hot Arizona weather isn't so nice. Service was ok, our server was on the rude side and acted as if we were an inconvenience to him. Food was ok, about what you'd expect from a theater. I would give it another try but I'd go for the upgraded cinema seating next time."}
{"text":"To start, the service was not great. The gal at the check in counter was unfriendly (to say the least).   Next, the seats are not that comfortable. Comparing to regular stadium seats they're average. BUT comparing to the reclining seats that the AMC at Desert Ridge provides they're pathetic. I know this part sounds a little whiney, but hang in there...you'll learn soon enough why this fact is significant.   Ok so the FOOD was ok. My kids got the chicken tenders and fries. What you'd expect from like a Chili's or Applebee's.   But here's where things took a turn for me. They charge $5.19 for an iced tea. Like a 10 oz that you'd get from a Chili's or Applebees. And refills are NOT free.   Not to mention the service while you're in the theater is slow as hell!   So for what you actually get, it's not worth the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"Forty dollars per person for a family movie night with no alcoholic beverages.  The tables were dirty with very little legroom, misbehaved children kicking chair backs and running around theater.  We will not be returning and recommend that readers not repeat my mistake."}
{"text":"This was without a doubt the worst experience I have ever had at a movie theater. Went to see the hobbit battle of five armies with my girlfriend. Some family decided to bring their 1.5 year old child. For the first hour they were fairly quite but after that it was nonstop crying or laughing or babbling, none of it on the quite side. Listen, I understand kids will be kids but if they are that young do not take them to a theater and ruin everyone's experience. And to top it off the employees there did absolutely nothing about it. Ruined the movie and I sure as hell will never be back."}
{"text":"Treated myself to Star Wars as a Christmas gift from my out-of-town father. I had never experienced the 18+ fork and knife (dine-in experience). For my first solo movie experience, I figured THIS is the way to see the most epic movie! Boy.. was I disappointed. Be warned service moves very slow or maybe my server had too large of a section. As a industry individual myself, I know the need for speed as it equals cash. I ordered a burger (the royal-bison... the best part of my experience! ORDER IT!) and a glass of water from a girl helping out. It came as it should in an appropriate amount of time for a burger- dropped off by another server. About an hour and fifteen minutes in or so, I push the button for a neat jameson. I wait. I see a male server past by four times in over twenty minutes before anyone even comes by to see what I'm requesting. I think to myself three things: 1. Is the button broken 2. Should I cancel if they ever come over 3. $1 tip on $24 it is. I did notice my server, who never introduced herself, was limping and could have been pregnant. Bare in mind G5 is near the back and I saw her working the front near the screen. I really should have got up, missed epic parts, and got a drink from the bar. But it's Star Wars and why chose the fork and screen if your drinks are served in over a half hour? Glad I got my cocktail ten minutes before the movie ended.  Needless to say, I will be preparing ahead of time as well as making the drive to a theatre with more prompt service."}
{"text":"Pros: - Comfortable seats, reasonably good pub-style food.   Cons: - Too much ambient light for 3-D films - glare on the glasses.  - Teach the servers how to master the billing system - or get a better billing system - there's no reason in this day and age for multiple checks during a single sitting (film).  Work out the kinks and this is a very viable business. Farrelli's had better food, but AMC gets points for seating."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the Esplanade for the whole movie experience they offer. The food was pretty good, especially the parmesan fries and fried shrimp. I've been to movies in both the Fork and Screen and the Suites, and found seating in both to be very comfortable."}
{"text":"So far we've been waiting for 10 minutes to be served it took a little longer but the guy was really nice and handled my friends and I orders with ease it made so extravagant what a treat. Although the service kind of slow the food it self was A-OK 3/5"}
{"text":"Nnnnooo...I prefer to order my own snacks for a movie before I enter the theater, thank you very much. I don't like buzzing my server like I'm in a Boeing 747 cabin & then wwwwwait for a damn popcornsies and soda.  I've seen TOO many movies here, but by gosh it's close to home. Last weekend I went to a random Harkins in the East Valley and the customer service and food seemed like a damn paradise compared to the Sit N PoOt AMC Dine-in and Get Gassy Theatres Esplanade 14.  The low-down:  1) Do you like sitting next to gassy neighbors eating greasy burgers, fries, jalapeno poppers and drinkin beer in the dark? Do you like smelling the results during 120 minutes of CGI space villains?  2) Some of the servers here are friendly and on-it. Some have seen better days. But no matter WHAT it takes too long to order...too long to get yer food...and too long to PAY. And of course the check/tip/process comes during the movie's conclusion. Annoyburgers! Grrrr!  3) THE VOLUME IN THESE THEATERS = ALWAYS WAY TO LLLOOOWWW. Seriously you will be straining to hear the movie because either the projector room dudes are slackin and smokin, or the speaker systems here are freakin WEAK. Or maybe both.  4) In ALL my times here, I have never once seen a manager enter the theater during a movie to test the picture and sound...something good movie theaters do regularly. Again, AMC PoOt and Toot doesn't care about your experience, so wtf, ya know?  5) Only a few seats per theater means if you go during peak times and you don't order ahead online to reserve your seat, forget it. I am a fan of the online reservation system. However I am NOT a fan of 30 seats per theater.  6), 7) and 8) Probably THE MOST ANNOYING facet of the Poot N Toot theater is the PAPER THIN WALLS, so you will always hear the movies playing next door to you. AMAZING since when you're in the damn theater you can barely hear YOUR movie. It's like all the speakers are positioned away from the audience and towards the walls. ARGH!!!  9) and 10) 20-40 minutes of trailers and commercials before your main attraction starts. F*ck you, AMC.  The good:  -Parking is easy. Just validate, jabroni. -They tend to show the movies you want to see. -The central Phx location.  Will I go back here? Unfortunately, yes. Just. Because. It's. So. Close. Will I go often? No. Will I EVER again patronize their gross food/kitchen? No. Popcorn = cold. Meats = cheap. Suds = not while I'm watching a movie, boss. I will pay as little as I possibly can because I just. want. to. see. the. movie.  Stupid concept. Indifferent management. Gross operations. Awesome location.  Poot."}
{"text":"I used to think that this was the most awesome place to see a movie!  The seats in the Cinema Suites are superior to the I Pics theaters and the price was very reasonable (half of the I Pics theaters).  The Menu USED to be packed with high quality food and an extensive menu.  I used to be more excited to eat here than to even see the movie!  I loved the Asian chicken salad and the pasta dishes with chicken or shrimp were fantastic!  The wedge salad was also great with shrimp added.  I could't wait to order and I have even come here for lunch without seeing a movie.  Well that all changed!!!!!  The folded card menu with no pictures is a cheap substitute with options that are low quality, finger, junk foods!!!  Total garbage and just reading the menu wanted to make me vomit!!!  If you think greasy french fries that are hours old, macaroni and cheese and chicken fingers are exciting then this is the place for you!  Forget about anything healthy!  Nothing is fresh, nothing is healthy and is only junk food that is promoting obesity!  So the  last time I went there and I saw the menu I was extremely disgusted!  I was so hungry because I expected to eat there I tried to find something edible.  I chose the sushi roll thinking at least that would be a healthier option.  It was the worst sushi I have ever had in my life.  It was obviously rolled the previous day or rolled by a factor somewhere, the rice was hard, there was barely any artificial crab in it (yes, artificial), the wasabi was not wasabi.  I think it is just a blob of flour that they added green food coloring in to make it appear like it was wasabi.  The entire blob had no wasabi flavor!  Then to make it even more disgusting they squirted mayonnaise all over the plate!  But they called it \"Japanese mayonnaise\" so that makes it legitimate, right? I never had a chance to complain and return the dish because I never saw the waiter again until at the end when I wanted to just leave.  I did complain before I ordered that the menu is horrible and the waiter simply agreed that the menu now \"sucks\" but he could't do anything about it. I noticed that the service has declined and also that the price of the tickets has gone up too! I was asked if I wanted to renew my \"stubs card\" registration and pay the yearly fee but after realizing that the food sucks, the price is higher and that the experience is NOT what it used to be, I declined.  I will not eat here again and will visit a local restaurant before seeing a movie.  By the way, \"Ten\" at the base of the escalator is wonderful to eat at."}
{"text":"The Cinema Suites are the way to go...21 yrs and older, GREAT recliners, good food and no proximity to other moviegoers. I wish I could rate this 6 stars. Better than watching it at home...and someone is bringing you food and drink!!!"}
{"text":"I hate writing a review based on one bad experience, but it was an exceptionally bad experience.  I had an order of chicken nachos and some popcorn, and regretted it immensely 6 hours later.  Got incredibly sick, and so did my friend who ate the same things.  I assume that it had to be the chicken nachos.  They tasted alright, but the repercussions were not worth a single bite.  Take precautions while eating food in the dark!"}
{"text":"Theater was not very clean Staff was courteous but not attentive.  Complained it was not a good place to work. Chairs are very comfortable Food was not good.  Sent mine back. Would not go back!"}
{"text":"Just had one of the worst experiences ever at this theater! NO service for over 20 minutes when we go there. NO one even came in when we lit our call lights, the entire row! Staff outside of theater was VERY rude! The manager Mario was nice, and tried his best to be helpful, but once the movie started, the server was absent even when called! Messed up our drink orders, forgot to use the coupon the manager gave us for desert, mixed up our tab with someone else in the theater when presenting the bill, NO pens in the binders to sign with, and clearly didn't want to be there!"}
{"text":"We attended the preview Fork & Screen weekend and was not impressed. It was nice to experience a free movie and lunch, but we will not be returning. All workers were friendly and helpful. The large seats were nice but leaned back too much. I felt like I got a great ab workout leaning back too far. There is a small light at the top of the armrest but it is generally blocked by your arm and too dim to see the menu or bill. I ordered a pepperoni pizza entree that came with a side of fries. My husband ordered the coconut shrimp. We both though the food was bland. We ordered a bag of popcorn to share and were shocked at the small size of it for $6.99. Usually AMC has great popcorn, but this was awful. It tasted like the oil they cooked it in was burnt and had a strange aftertaste. The concept sounds great, but I would rather eat at a sit down restaurant inside the theater and not be bothered by a waiter while watching my movie.   Pros: bigger chairs, validate parking, *It was free* full bar Cons: blah food, bad popcorn, waiters interrupting, parking, too dark to read menu, chairs that won't sit up enough"}
{"text":"Use to work at this location. Horrible management and over worked employees.  Food is over priced its Apple bees quality with Ruth Chris prices!!! Tickets are expensive as well. Not worth trying in my opinion"}
{"text":"I thought this would be expensive, and waiters going in and out annoying. This place was AMAZING! The seats were so comfortable, and the way the theater is laid out you don't even notice the waiters. the food and drinks are normal price compared to a restaurant, and not overpriced like I thought it would be (like a normal theater for popcorn/drinks/candy, etc). The bar in the lobby is awesome, and the staff is friendly. We had a problem with our tickets, they split us up (you mainly order ahead of time and get reserved seating). they helped us and got us exactly what we wanted. I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Comfortable? Sure.  Drinks are way expensive.  I don't eat dinner at a theater regardless, so can't tell you how good that is.  If you want popcorn, it's \"one size fits all\" and it's huge!  Way too much for two people, might as well share with the whole row and just pass the bowl.  Service great, and friendly, but in some theaters they can get in the way while watching a movie.  I still prefer iPic."}
{"text":"Cinema suites! Recliners are the best!  We've gone to a total of 4 movies in the Cinema Suites over 2 visits.  We rarely go to movies when we're home.    The menu is solid.  Every item we ordered (dessert, drinks, entrees) were good.    The tickets for the Cinema Suites are a few dollars more, but the experience is worth the extra money.  You get to choose your seats when you purchase your tickets.  Therefore, you don't have to worry about getting to the theater early to get a good seat.    The commercials and trailers are a bit too long (or maybe I just don't go to enough movies in the theaters).  I'm in the reclined position with a drink in my hand, so I don't mind the extra 15 minutes of trailers."}
{"text":"The server was incredibly rude and loud when taking orders from other movie goers during the movie. I felt like the seats were not as comfortable as other dine in theaters. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Theatre was great. I had never been there before. The only thing I would say is that they should have a little bit more complex items on their menu. Some of them are big dishes and when they come out it stinks up the theatre. Other than that it was really nice."}
{"text":"They have Cinemasuites AND Fork and Screen. I was so skeptical the first time someone told me a dinner theater could actually be a pleasant experience, since usually you go and it's noisy and the food isn't as good as it could be elsewhere, and movie theater food is always suspicious anyways. But AMC actually trained their employees to serve food during a movie without being intrusive, and I've seen three or four movies with dinner and drinks now and had a great time every time. The food is actually good! Regular movie tickets cost enough anyway you might as well make a night of it and have dinner and drinks all at the same place. Speaking of drinks, they don't skimp on the booze either."}
{"text":"I could not be more obsessed with the Cinema Suites option at this theater. Plush, comfy leather chairs that completely recline and are reserved in advance so there is no hassle. A mini bowl of complimentary popcorn. Great service. A little chocolate when you leave. It is the absolute best! I wish I could go everyday. And I'm not even a movie person..."}
{"text":"A really disappointing experience with AMC starts by getting to a PG13 movie in time for a 4:15 show. Kids were excited to see a teen flick \"Divergent\". Unfortunately, AMC was showing that in a 21-and -older theatre. Huh? Come back in 2.5 hours or drive across Phoenix to another AMC that's playing Divergent in 30 minutes. When we get to the second AMC, they've canceled the showing for \"maintenance\". Ugh.  This is supposed to be entertainment, not a wild goose chase."}
{"text":"Coke sprite and diet...what about the other 97 choices on the menu....dump, dirty , rippped seats, dirty floor no soap in restrooms.  Servers are nice but place is worn and a  Dump... Harkins is way better."}
{"text":"We love coming here, it's always good service and cozy seats, but if you are looking to eat go to iPic, the new and \"improved\" menu is absolutely terrible, I would have rather eaten at McDonald's (I hate McDonald's). Other than the new menu we still love going and is always a good experience, please please bring your old menu back!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here!! This is the only place I come for movies, but it's a shame that the bar staff is not very knowledgeable about basic drinks ie sidecar and an old fashions with the prices we pay you would think they would be awesome I will continue to come for the movies but guess I'll just stick to beers until the bar staff fix themselves"}
{"text":"My favorite movie theater. Why? It's clean, the refreshment lines are short, many nearby dining & drinking options (and not just a Sbarro's or Chile's), covered parking (underground), it's a relatively safe neighborhood, and it's not tucked in a shopping mall. Add another plus - customer service. Last night we lingered at Morton's so long that we missed our 7PM show for which we prepurchased tickets. No problem they said, and handed us tickets for the 8PM. Very cool."}
{"text":"True to my word, I have to amend this review. We went on Valentine's Day a few years ago and it was slammed and the service/experience suffered for it. BUT we've been back twice since then and it's been great. Nice seats, quick and friendly service, good food!  I have to say that they have just recently changed their entire menu and from looking online all of our favorites are gone! Prices look a little higher and there's a little less variety. Maybe check out the menu on their website before you buy tickets. But overall this can be a fun place to see a movie."}
{"text":"Wow surprised to read some bad experiences because me and my partner had a fabulous first time here. We called ahead of time to confirm what they provided and a gentlemen named Alex was so kind and very helpful over the phone. He was very detailed explaining everything to us even how to get there from our destination. We got there and everything was so smooth. We were extremely surprised on the emptiness, since this was a Saturday night we were expecting the place to be packed and cramped but it was great! As we sat down there is mood lighting on your chairs so you can see your food as you eat and our waiter was so kind and chill. It was a casual vibe which we didn't mind at all because lets be honest it would have been weird to see someone walk up to us in a tie or something. Honestly there is so much I can say about this that it will take to long to write so here are the basics.  1. Great service 2. Great environment and vibe. 3. Amazing food. 4. We didn't mind the prices at all because honestly its like any other restaurant. 5. WE ARE HOOKED!!!! Definitely will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"At last a theater for adults, this place is awesome drinks are great but the food is so so this is the only theater that I go to."}
{"text":"Food is so so. Service was poor. The food is also a bit pricey especially for what you get. The portions are a little on the small side. My date ordered the quinoa bowl and for $12 you get barely half a bowel of food. The burger I got was OK but there were hardly any fries.   Comparing this to Roadhouse Cinemas in Tucson, this place looses. The chairs are not as comfortable and the food is nowhere as good.   Having said all that the movie was good and the popcorn was delicious."}
{"text":"Very fun experience -- we ordered the white cheese nachos, and they were pretty yummy. I thought the ticket prices were very fair. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because I thought the wine was pretty overpriced. Come on, people, more than fifteen bucks for a glass of Cupcake malbec??  Even so, we had a good time. We'll definitely come back if we're in the Phoenix area and want an out-of-the-ordinary movie-watching experience."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place to go on a date! The seats are so comfortable and they have a good menu. It's a little pricey but it's worth it! Their smoothies are also super good."}
{"text":"$8 for popcorn.  That is not right.  Seriously I can't order a smaller size.  I would rather go to a regular theater and not be bothered by the inattentive server, the people eating noisily with fork and knife around me, and the light that is so bright next to my side that it is distracting.  Blah!!  I think I am most upset about the popcorn.  The food is average  and over priced and the whole serving people with in a movie is really not a great idea.    I like many other Americans appreciate value and good deals.  The amc esplanade offers neither when it comes to food at least.  If you are going to pay $9 for some potato skins at least make them really good.   They were actually ok but the whole experience leaves a sour taste."}
{"text":"If I could give separate ratings for the movie theater experience and the restaurant/bar experience, I would give the theater a 4 star rating and the bar/restaurant a 2 or 3 star rating. Here's why:  The movie theater is probably my preferred choice in the Phoenix metro area. Christown? No freakin' way. I don't want to get shot on the way to my car. Tempe marketplace? Not unless you want to watch 17-year olds make out in every row. Arizona Center, nope. Not there, either.    The theater is pretty clean, and paying the extra two bucks to sit in giant, reclining chairs, have an assigned seat, not deal with kids talking, etc. is totally worth it, IMO. I can just purchase my tickets online and avoid having to wait in line or the possibility that the showing will be sold out. Genius.  Parking is in an attached garage and is free when you remember to validate.  Honestly, the only negative thing I really have to say about the theatre itself is that every time I go into a restroom there, the first stall is always out of tp. Always. Sometimes the second, too. The bathrooms seem to be cleaned and maintained regularly, except for this detail, which kind of turns into a big detail when there are twenty women waiting in line for the bathroom when the movie gets out. It must be the Murphy's Law of movie theatre bathrooms. Ugh.   The bar/restaurant is mehhh. If it were just a stand alone restaurant, it wouldn't be anywhere I'd frequent for the food itself. Think an above-average Applebee's. But having the option to actually order real food (and DRINKS!) in the theatre is pretty neat. The waitstaff always does a good job of not being disruptive during the movie, and are usually very friendly. Candy/soda/popcorn can also be ordered, at pretty typical movie theatre prices. But again, not having to stand in line with 50 other people for a package of red vines and a sprite makes it SO worth it.  Lastly, there are two theatre types. Cinema Suites and Fork & Screen. When you go online to check showtimes/purchase tickets, it shows you what type of theatre every particular showing is in. There's usually some in each type of theatre for each movie. This is where it gets kinda weird-fork and screen is fine, I would still come here if that was the only type of theatre. Still a comfy chair in a way better theatre. But after sitting in the cinema suites, you won't want to go back. Huge seats (that recline! woot!) and way more space in between the groups of seats. Because the last thing you want is to be sitting THIS CLOSE to a stranger who's apparently never eaten a taco before and loves to elbow bump all movie long."}
{"text":"Terrible Service! Never going back!  My girlfriend and I went to see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes here and had quite a poor experience. The tickets were expensive ($13 a person) and when we sat down someone came after about 5 minutes to get our drink order. We ordered two waters and a few minutes later the server came back for our food order. We told her what we wanted (potato skins, two burgers).  The appetizer came and we had still not received our waters that we initially ordered. I told the server that we had not received them and asked that she get them for us. We also asked for silverware and napkins. She said she would check on them but the bar was really backed up at this point. What bothered me the most was that the people in front of us ordered their drinks when they got there and received them within 2 minutes. As did everyone else around us.   We finished our appetizer and the burgers came out. Still no water... We asked the person delivering the food if she could bring us some water as we had been waiting 45 minutes on our drinks. She said she would check. No water ever came. We finished our burgers waited about 5 more minutes and then asked the next person we saw for water as we had been waiting 70 minutes for two simple waters. 10 minutes later they were brought out. We never received silverware or napkins either. The wait staff constantly got the seats mixed up for people's orders.   The movie was very good. The food was above average. Better than I expected. The service.... completely terrible. I will honestly say that I will never visit this theater again because of the service alone."}
{"text":"Major fail today... couldn't load a one day showing of the Yokai kids movie... needless to say there was a theater full of very disappointed kids that had been waiting to see this movie for weeks that unfortunately missed because it was showing for ONE DAY ONLY. Expected more from a movie chain this large!"}
{"text":"The light from the table next to you for your food is sooo annoying!! You'll notice it out of the corner of your eyes during the entire movie!! I thought this place would be really cool - eating more than just popcorn in a theater! The FOOD IS CRAP!! Like cheap frozen food they pop in the microwave. We tried a lot of different food here. Prime example: the brownies - they didn't taste like box brownies (I think boxed are good), they tasted like the packaged brownies you buy at a gas station except they warm them up in the microwave. Why would you pay so much more to go here other then to eat and maybe drink?? It's just annoying sitting with servers constantly walking in front of you and bothering you."}
{"text":"Loved this and will totally do it again. This is first class all the way with reserved seating, great food and service and  yet surprisingly affordable. Seats are comfortable and roomy. Service is friendly and efficient. Food was delicious and affordably priced. This takes dinner and a movie to a whole new level."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several years, since they first opened this dine in theater. I have watched menu prices go up as quality of food and service has gone down. Arriving this afternoon, I noticed just how shabby the theater has become.. The seats and armrests in the auditoriums are cracked and ripped. The carpeting is stained.  The walls need a good cleaning and/or coat of paint. There is a new theater in town (Roadhouse Cinemas) that is doing a much better job with comfort, quality, pricing and menu selection. It might be a little further drive, but it is most definitely work making the trip to Roadhouse Cinemas."}
{"text":"I give these guys a HUGE plus for the seating (be warned make sure and get the cinema suites not the fork and screen for a really comfy movie watching experience). I love having the option to lay out in a huge recliner and catch the newest Harry Potter,  but they really need to work on some of their food items. I have tried 5 different menu items and they all needed some TLC from the chef. However you can't go too hard on the food #1 your eating and getting waited at the movies so WOOHOO, and number #2 you can enjoy your favorite glass (or bottle) of wine maybe even a 23 ounce Blue Moon."}
{"text":"Not worth it.  First, we went to a 4pm matinee and it cost $24 ... that is $10 more than seeing a matinee at our usual theater.  Then we ordered some of their Italiano (sausage and pepperoni) pizza.  It tasted like bad frozen pizza and it was $10 per pizza.  The ice tea was $4.50 for unlimited refills, but it didn't taste good and we couldn't even get the server to bring us a glass of ice (since they put hardly any ice in it).  The popcorn was $7.75 with unlimited refills, but I was the only one eating popcorn and didn't need refills.  My usual theater gives me free popcorn if I spend $20 yearly for a t-shirt and $1 drink refills on their souvenir cup.  Our total tab was around $64 including tip.  Thought it was just too much for bad food.  Seats are okay, but I find them uncomfortable since I don't like to lean.  They aren't really any more spacious than a regular theater since you have the moveable tray.   I think I enjoy eating at a restaurant and then seeing a movie; I would spend some time talking to my spouse when I go out."}
{"text":"If there was a zero star button I would have selected it. Definitely the worse customer service I have ever received my entire life. The guy who gives out tickets is incredibly rude! I have been coming to this theater since 2005 and then stopped going about 2 years ago because of the staff change. This location is literally down the street from my house and I still would 100% rather go to any Harkins (Tempe Marketplace 20-30mins away!) Than to ever go back to amc esplanade again.  I just recently went to try out the dine - in experience and watch a movie. The second I walked up to the ticket counter was when it all went downhill. I'm sure by reading these previous reviews, everyone is talking about the same guy I'm talking about. They really need to reevaluate their staff. Horrible!"}
{"text":"If you compare the total experience here to any other traditional theatre in the valley, it's hands down the best.   Reserved Seating:  You can select and reserve your seats online. Sooo if you are dying to see a new movie you can reserve your seat instead of showing up an hour early to stand in line! That is worth any price to me! Jus sayin.   Theatre Seats:  The seats themselves both in the Fork n Screen and the Suites are superior over any other theatre seating.  The seats are far enough from strangers that you don't feel uncomfortable or smell their breath! lol  (The Suite side for adults have recliners)  Food Service: You have a waiter/waitress. All you have to do is press a button and they come runnin!  Can't get that at any traditional movie theatre!  One experience the waiter brought our food late into the movie, and didn't respond to the button, so the manager took care of the bill.   Food: It's bar and grill food. If you're ordering gourmet food and expecting it to taste like Dominicks Steak House, etc., then you're mistaken.   Drinks and popcorn: All you can drink soda and popcorn. If you don't like it, have them replace it.   The overall experience is positive, especially if you're on a date. The recliners go all the way back...side grin. Oh, and don't get the seats up on top. There's a wall the separates the last seats from the rest and it's in the way of the view."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been pretty regular visitors here and not only enjoyed the comfy seats,  but also the food offered.... There was something for everybody on the menu, even healthy choices.  What were the thinking  changing  to a menu that offers nothing but fried stuff.. And a five types of macaroni and cheese  dishes...... Really!  What really topped it off today was the fact that the have thus elaborate drink menu but when I went to order,  was told they did not have any of the drinks listed!!  Having a business of my own,  I cannot follow this strategy.  I like the comfy chairs,  don't think I will be back any time soon.... Nor recommend this theatre."}
{"text":"Read the fine print. Some movies are only 21+ because of the alcohol even though it's not explicit when buying tickets online which is a joke. A lot of time and gas wasted driving over for a movie. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"So disappointed in AMC... They changed their menu,and are now serving crappy food but with the same high prices. I used to come here for a good lunch (beef tips and mashed potatoes, lettuce wraps, wedge salad),but now its stale popcorn and hard pretzles and cheese. What a let-down.  Signed, X-AMC fan"}
{"text":"Love love love this theater. Amazing to sit down and eat during the movie. Staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Love this venue. Its in a great location next to the best shopping venues in Scottsdale and the theater is never crowded! You get friendly servers and a descent menu selection.   I went here for the first time with some of my girl friends to see Side Effects! Loved the movie very hot and sensual! Its an awesome spot for a date night too. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This dine-in, drink-in theater was truly a wild experience. When you walk in and see a full bar in the lobby, you know it is different. As for the food, I will say the bacon, cheeseburger I had was incredible!! I also like the concept that in a lot of the theaters it is age restricted to nobody under 21 which also comes with lazy-boy reclining chairs. You also have assigned seats so it's important to either get there earlier or pay the extra $1 charge to order online so you get good seats (but how they have it spread out really makes most of the seats really good).  My only hold back is that this place is not cheap! A large import beer was $7, the burger was $10, small popcorn $7 (with unlimited refills), and my ticket was $12 for a matinee on a Sunday. But this is definitely something that must be experienced."}
{"text":"This AMC sounded like a great alternative to Studio Movie Grill in Scottsdale.  However, we were greatly disappointed. In addition to a server telling us our sodas were going to take 25 minutes to get to us, this brought us their loaded chicken nacho styled appetizer. It was so spicy that just the smell made my eyes water. We requested to change it out with something else. An hour into the movie, we finally got our soft drinks and the new appetizer of mozzarella sticks. Now, with the mozzarella sticks appetizer it states it comes with marinara sauce. They brought us salsa. At the end of the movie, they brought our check. The check was wrong. The waitress asked to just take our card and she'd be back to grab it with the correct receipt attached. She didn't come. We sat thru the credits wondering when she'd come. Finally she came. To ensure no error was made, we circled and wrote directly onto the receipt to take off the chicken disaster. If you want an experience not from hell and want to enjoy a movie with food, go to Studio Movie Grill in Scottsdale or rent from Redbox and make your own food. This dump isn't worth the ticket, let alone the shitty food and service that comes with it."}
{"text":"This definitely makes for a fun date night!  I've been here twice now since it reopened as a dine-in theatre and have enjoyed each experience, although customer service was much better the second time around.  Both times we've gone, our movies have only been in the Fork & Screen theatres - looking forward to trying the next level up.   The last time I was there, we weren't able to make reservations online since we were paying with gift cards. So we got there early, enjoyed a drink around the corner at my fave bar - Merc. And then arrived 10 mins before previews started to order our dinner. It worked out perfectly. I ordered their brisket sandwich concoction - it's not even on the menu yet - and I was quite pleased with it. And my pomegranate martini was delish - a little on the sweet side - but that's what I prefer!  The previous time we went, we split their queso blanco dip w/chips and thai coconut chicken skewers. The chicken skewers were pretty good, but the queso dip was horrible. Tasted like your typical concession stand nacho cheese. So i would stay away from that.  All in all, I'm a fan and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I get it. This is supposed to be really cool - eating and drinking in the theater. Sadly, it wasn't until after I'd purchased my ticket that I realized what I was getting myself into, and at the time I was just looking to see a movie - not have an \"experience.\"   I'm going to try really hard not to just be a curmudgeon about the whole thing, but there are a few flaws I'd like to see fixed before I ever go again.  1) Figure out some way to make the lights next to the seats optional. I hated having a light on the entire movie. I didn't need it but there was no way to shut it off. 2) Get the servers more comfortable with serving. They were a little slow and forgetful. I'm figuring it's just due to the fact that we're in a dark theater and this is a new thing. 3) I know that there is a poster talking about how the whole thing works, but I didn't see it. I'm not the type to just go asking for help because I'm stubborn and want to figure most things out myself. (Grumpy Becky is voicing her opinions now, sorry.) That being said, I kinda wish it would have been easier for me to figure out on my own and through a little less trial-and-error. (I sat for about fifteen minutes waiting for service before realizing that I needed to push the service button.) I know, I'm being THAT girl.  Also, let it be noted that if you're going in a group of three, be ready for the third wheel to feel even more excluded. The seats are set up perfectly for couples...and that's about it.  I will probably try this place at least one more time, but I'll hope to swindle someone into buying my ticket for me."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to coming here with my mom. She was taking me to see Mike and Dave for my 20th birthday. We reserved our tickets online, not knowing that this was a 21+ movie. There is a TINY sign when buying the ticket online that says 21+ but it was definitely too small for me to notice. Upon arrival, the cashier scanned the tickets and charged us for the tickets. AFTER they already charged my moms card, the cashier asked me how old I was and I told her I was 20. She proceeded to tell me I could not enter the auditorium. She should have asked me before she charged our card. She didn't apologize for the inconvenience but instead, argued with us and told us that we should have seen the 21+ warning on the web site. We asked to get a refund since I couldn't be admitted inside and she just rolled her eyes and walked away to get a manager. They ended up just letting us see the movie. I was very disappointed with the service :(   AMC, if you read these, PLEASE, have your employees check ID before you charge us. And work on making it more obvious that a movie will be 21+ for people reserving seats online. Because clearly it's not that noticeable."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite theater. Not so anymore. We went last night and asked to see if they had seats together for a show. We were told no, so we got separate seats. When we got into the theater the entire last two rows were open. Second, they've started showing literally 30 minutes of previews. Third, when we pressed the service button to order food, 30 more minutes elapsed and no one ever came up to us. I went to complain, but there was no manager to be found. The bartender had to run food to me. By the time I ordered food from the bar (and missed the movie in the process) no one had helped my friends who  still had their call lights on.  Between the crappy service and previews, there's just literally no reason to come to this theater anymore. Go to desert ridge if you must--avoid this theater at all costs."}
{"text":"AMC Dine-In is easily the premiere eat-in movie experience.  It's not just the fact that you can get food and drinks during your movie (which is great), but the quality of the whole experience.  Service is fast and awesome.  The menu is huge - this is no bar menu.  The seats and super comfortable leather recliners with power recline - you could easily sleep in these seats.  Table tops and cup holders are perfect for dining or keeping out of your way.  I don't even want to go to regular movies anymore."}
{"text":"Great experience.   While not as classy as iPic, located in the center Biltmore, surrounded by vistas of the Phoenix mountains makes up for it being just a regular theater.   Really really cheap tickets, but it's to encourage you to order food. I did have an issue with getting someone to talk to about ordering, but it was resolved quickly. So other than that this is a great theater, with big comfy chairs, however don't expect them to bring you a blanket and pillow like at iPic.   It's a great place for a date, knocking out a dinner and movie at one place for a nice price."}
{"text":"Comfy seats, good service, below average food. Don't forget to bring your parking pass to get it validated."}
{"text":"I'm going to start with you are paying for the experience of having dinner and a movie.  For someone who works in the \"industry\" we have a saying \"Hotel and Airport prices... what can you do.\"  The same applies here.  You should expect to drop $100 for tickets, app, 2 entrees, and dessert (their shakes are huge so you can easily share this)The food is mediocre but the serving sizes are fair.   Here's  why they got too stars.  Part of the experience is having a button in case you need a refill on your drink, want to order something a little extra etc.  Kind of like calling your steward on an airplane.  So half way through the movie I push my button.  My $4.50 + tax coke was empty.  10 minutes go by still no one comes.  My daughter pushes her button as she doesn't have any more of her drink left.  Another ten minutes go by STILL no one comes.   Okay... SHIT happens.  I get up and leave the theater (like you would at a normal theater where drinks are only $3) and go ask the very sweet bartender if I can get some assistance in the theater because we've pushed the button and could really use some drinks.  She says absolutely.  I kid you not 15 minutes before the movie ends a girl (who was not the person I ordered from) rudely asked what we needed.  Really!?!?!   For the price that you are paying for the \"experience\" service should be included.  And if you provide a tool to help with that service it should be used.  And when it's  used and you fall short when I ask for help (politely as I totally get it the things happen) don't  be rude.   I will eat at a restaurant next time and go to a movie afterwards.  Sorry AMC"}
{"text":"I love movies. Going to see the latest flick is one of my favorite things to do, and I don't mind doing so at AMC Esplanade. Here they give you the option to do the Dine-In theatre, where you get big comfy recliner chairs and a waitress who will serve you restaurant style food and drinks - alcohol included! It is a fun movie-going experience, and makes for a great date night or a night out with friends. The only real con is that prices can add up fast as tickets, food, and drinks are all paid for separately. But the overall experience is nice, and I'd recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I read the reviews and I must say I have had completely different experiences. The staff is both courteous and friendly. they offered me several suggestions and the wait for drinks and food was minimal. I suggest to the people who dislike this theatre so much please go somewhere else and save the good seats for those of us who love this place! AMC you hit a home run here and we love you for it..."}
{"text":"This was always my go to theater.  Our experience last night was not what I expected here.  The menu here has changed.  It is not anywhere near as good as it used to be.  The food we did get was mediocre at best.    The seats were filthy when we came in and had to wait for someone to come and clean them before we could even sit down.  The menus were also filthy and sticky.  Definitely NOT worth the premium price anymore.  I live really close to this theater and it really is sad that I'll now drive elsewhere for a movie."}
{"text":"What an amazing laid back theater! Literally you can lay all the way back in the seats. Not to mention a friendly waiter or waitress is always just a ring of a bell away"}
{"text":"There was no server available at all this is happened three times we were only two people in the whole theater do yourself a favor and go to Harkins instead"}
{"text":"This was our third visit to the AMC on Camelback.  The first time was before it became a dine in venue, and the second time was before we KNEW it had become a dine in venue.  That time, the guest services agent was so rude to us when they came to understand we had not made a reservation before brazenly appearing 20 minutes before a start time I would never have returned to the location again.    Since a friend had given us some vouchers and gift cards we decided to brave it with a little better planning after my husband had knee surgery.  We thought the reclining seats would be more comfortable for him.  So I called the day before to find out how we could use the vouchers if we had to purchase our tickets online ahead of time to get a seat.  The agent was friendly enough and advised us we could purchase the tickets and they would exchange the vouchers after the show.  I suspected it would not be as easy as that, and my instincts were right. After the show, the cashier said she didn't know if she could do what we were asking and called the MOD.  This person had the poorest customer service skills I have ever encountered, and having worked (and managed) in customer service/retail/restuarants myself, I know there was something he could have done.  He chose rather to refuse to make it right, so at the end of the day, we paid for the tickets out of pocket and were stuck with the vouchers to a theater we would neither return to NOR send our friends to by regifting the vouchers. More on this below*  Additionally, while the server was nice, the tray and menus at my seat were dripping with something unknown and sticky and greasy.  She served me a flat coke and when I sent it back, she brought me one that was good, then brought my refill with the FLAT coke again.  REALLY?  The popcorn was stale and not hot, so I would definitly have saved $9.  Considering that I have again and again commented to my husband how GOOD the service is at our locally owned theatres, Harkins, I don't think I would consider going anywhere else unless he gets the other knee done and needs the recliner.  So all in all, the only thing that wasn't terrible about this experience was the chair and the movie.  *being suspicious of the ease of the exchange was my problem here. I used the CG to buy the ticket online, rather than use my debit card since under no circumstances did I want any credit for this awful theatre when the day was over. When I went to the counter to see what they could do with my vouchers, they were unable to refund the balance i paid online back to the card so I could then use it to pay $20 for the stale popcorn and flat coke.  The manager had a choice between us leaving pissed and figuring something out, but he was unable to think of a thing.  In the same position, I would have perhaps comped us a bill credit on our concessions in exchange for the vouchers rather than seeing us walk out angry and ready to write a terrible review about stuff I would have let slide, like the crappy popcorn or the goo I stuck my hand in when I opened the menu.  Let it be known I still tipped her 25% even though I would certainly not have re-served flat coke to a guest.  She wouldn't be working in a dine in theatre on a weekday if she were a rocket scientist."}
{"text":"Tried to buy movie tickets online and was told \"movie tickets were not available at this time\". I called to ask if our movie was sold out and if we could pick another time so we wouldn't have to drive all the way out to Scottsdale if it was unavailable and was transferred to an assistant who told me to call again later."}
{"text":"Super comfy chairs.. relaxing... and a good time to get away and just relax. The new bar is always a plus.. and our waiter Phillip was pretty awesome as well. The only down side to our adventure? We sat in the top row and if you put your chair back at all the little wall in front of you cuts off about half of the screen... design flaw much? Other than that.. pretty great.. can't wait for another movie!"}
{"text":"Went to see Captain America tonight. Movie was great. I ordered the hamburger, it was good, the fries were cold. Date ordered nachos, they were cold and they couldn't make new ones because they were out. Ordered drink- margarita, it was $12 and good but not $12 worth."}
{"text":"This theater is amazing. I love being able to go to the movies, be comfortable, have some drinks, and best of all have no screaming children ruining the movie. Love this place"}
{"text":"So disappointed in the experience I had Friday night when I took my family to see Leap.  My 8 year old daughter was very excited for the dinner & movie concept, but the food was not properly cooked and the popcorn was stale.  Our server Abby was very nice and tried hard to accommodate us, but the overall experience was not the quality that I would expect for the prices paid."}
{"text":"Dining experience was well executed, but the quality of the food and price did not do it justice. How do you screw up chicken tenders? I've had better from fast food joints. Seating was clever and practical, just no where to hang a jacket. If you're not from the area, it can be a pain to find the entrance and parking. Didn't help the movie I was dragged to sucked, but the service was actually really good. Crappy food, cumbersome locale and parking, and overpriced.... Eat at a restaurant first, then go to a normal theatre."}
{"text":"Overpriced tickets, lousy communication, passive aggressive employees. I walked out before I even got my tickets. If I could rate this zero stars I would."}
{"text":"The food was fresh, the seats are wonderful, lots of room, all round a great date. But for the drinks guy who kept acting like he really didn't want to be there, this is a five star place. Superb."}
{"text":"Still the best place to watch a movie, but no longer a complete date in one location. They just downsized their menu and filled it with sushi and quinoa and 12-dollar mac and cheese. Bring back a real menu and you get your other 2 stars back, AMC."}
{"text":"I don't care how much it costs. I'll never see another movie in anything other than their cinema suites again. Ever.  I love their leather recliners! They are just as comfortable as the one at your grandparents house. Plus, you get beer delivered to you at the touch of a button and prices are surprisingly reasonable (4 for a pint of domestic, 5 for imports). Plus, you get a sample of specialty popcorn, a warm towel, and a Ghirardelli chocolate on your way out.   It can get crowded in the evenings, so you might want to consider purchasing your tickets ahead of time.  Don't go expecting AMC to serve you a gourmet meal unless you think Applebee's is a real treat."}
{"text":"We go to Film Bar fairly regularly.  You can bring your own food or purchase theirs, which includes some very fine tamales.  Since we were going to be at the Biltmore, we decided to try the Esplanade 14 dine-in theater.  We chose the fork&screen option.  The seats were well padded and leaned slightly backwards, but did not actually recline.  So they were comfortable except that to eat you had to sit up straight while your seat remained in its slightly reclined position.  On the tray next to your seat, the theater provides a dinner-sized cloth napkin, restaurant grade, wrapped around metal bread knife and fork.  Very nice!  However, be sure you open your napkin and check your utensils before the lights go off.  Both of ours were dirty, especially the knives with dried food particles.  Hoping to avoid bothering the server and because we were alone in our row with no others in the rows before or behind us, we opened and checked other utensil packages (4 additional sets), none of which were clean.  Our server graciously provided clean utensils. The food itself was fine, not great, but good enough.  I had fish and chips at $12, which was as good as Rose McCaffrey's. The meal included fries, a brussels sprouts slaw (slightly bitter), and garlic cheddar buttermilk biscuits (very good).  My partner had a hamburger; he thought the $12 price high but he was well satisfied with quality. His hamburger came with french fries.  Our server asked if he would prefer tater tots or their special fires instead.  He decided on tater tots but did not discover that meant an extra charge until the check arrived.  This on top of the $12!, especially since our server did not warn there would be an extra charge for substituting tater tots.  However, other than failing to tell us about the extra charge, our server was polite and helpful.  Next time we chose fork&screen, we'll avoid being uncomfortable while eating by ordering drinks and finger food.  That way we can continuously decline with our slightly reclined, well-padded chairs.  The movie was good, so overall we had a pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Wow! This theatre has redefined a night out at the movies. They've taken everything we dislike about most movie theatres and replaced it with a new way to cater to America's favorite obsession. Here are some examples (but you've gotta experience this for yourself to fully appreciate it):  Typical theatre: Get to the movie early so you can beat the crowds and find a good seat.  Esplanade 14: Choose your seat beforehand (all seats same price)  Typical theatre: stand in line at the concession stand and give up a better seat or part of your movie and expect major price gouging.  Esplanade 14: pay reasonably priced concessions from the comfort of your seat with the help of a server (included).   Typical theatre: small, dirty/sticky, cloth seats with little leg room Esplanade 14: big plush leather seats with a fold out table with so much leg room you should never touch the seat in front of you. And they were thinking large Americans here- No problems for the 300+ pounders. They won't be spilling over into the seat next to them.  These seats rock!...literally   Typical theatre: various popcorn sizes and drink sizes all rediculously priced.  Esplanade 14: one popcorn size 7.50 (free refills and large enough to feed anyone), one drink size (large with free refills). Not a rip off either.   Typical theatre: $10-$11 Esplanade 14: $13 and probably should cost more.   Only one negative thing to say: I don't like the extra butter for my popcorn on the side in a small plastic cup. I don't know how to put it on like the specially trained concessions staff and it's difficult in the dark. The theatre should complete the preparation of the popcorn before it reaches your seat."}
{"text":"Out of all the dine-in theaters we have in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area  I do take preference to this one due to price and service. iPic is awesome but extremely overpriced, and the rest are a dud.    I love having the cinema suites with 21+ only to avoid children and crying babies which is often the culprit of a ruined movie experience.    The drinks are a little expensive, but I wouldn't expect any less at a dine in theater. I've definitely paid more for a cocktail in Old Town,    The food is served in fair portions, but as stated in other reviews the menu is like a Chili's. Their Parmesan fries are ridiculously good!   Service is always fast and attentive, staff overall is great.    We will be back for other movies!"}
{"text":"Horrible! 8 dollars for popcorn. You kidding me?  Seating is terrible. The self serve machines in the lobby don't work. Very overpriced tickets. Piss poor food. Terrible candy options. Please read what I am writing and trust me...GO TO HARKINS!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad.... But not unbelievably great either. This place is a bit overpriced for what it is and the food is mediocre at best (comparable to maybe say, Applebee's, or something along those lines?). The location is convenient for those living in east or central Phoenix and the leather chairs and recliners are nice touches as well. Choosing your seat ahead of time helps ensure you know what you're signing up for and eliminates the need to hunt around in the dark to get a group seated together, etc. All things considered, I wouldn't go out of my way to catch a flick here and I'd definitely grab something to eat somewhere else before or after the movie."}
{"text":"My husband and friend went to see \"The Other Women\" on 5-25 and had a family behind us that had a 10 month old who cried often (of course it was his nap time) and then with his boredom he tipped over glasses and kept pushing the service buttom, The 2 women had their phones on talking out loud. When we complained to the manager he told us that babies/children were allowed in the theatre in the am and afternoons and they weren't allowed to ask families to leave. The manager was extremely arrogant and continued to insult our sensibilities with stupid excuses how children prevailed even though before the movie the rest of us are told to turn our phones off and not to disturb others during the movie. I have never had this experience with Harkin's anywhere in the Valley, and even though this is considered a higher class establishment i would rate it very low. I was told that you have to attend movies where kids aren't welcomed  (theatre's 1-7),  however what if you want to see that peticular movie?  This was by NO means a child's movie much less an appropriate movie for a baby. We purchased our seats and the theatre was full and small so moving wasn't an option. My husband and friend are post cancer patience's so attending a movie at night is difficult for them.  Be aware of this place, know the rules and stay away during the day with theatre's (8-14 ). If there is a movie you want to see don't go there if it's during the day in the movie theatre's allowing babies and children.  They gave us free tickets to come back but after being insulted by the rude manager, I returned them and told him to give them to someone who cares. We will never step back in this place again. I am in Pediatrics and love children, but not all parents are insightful enough to respect others when they go to the movies. And, then again, I guess they knew what they were doing because their poor choices are reinforced by the Management.  Our first 2 times there were very nice but this last time was our last. Good Luck and be very paranoid."}
{"text":"This is the only movie theatre I enjoy going to. I like to know exactly where I am going to sit. The seats are big and somewhat comfy-after getting settled in. I appreciate my personal space which I get here. The fact that we can order food and drinks from a full bar....enough said. It's clean way more than not. Noticed once the seat/console area needed to be wiped down better and one of our menus looked like someone literally took a bite out of it, no biggie tho. The staff has always been friendly, helpful, and attentive. We've never had an issue with parking and they have a machine to validate the garage ticket. AMC Esplanade is our first choice to go watch a movie."}
{"text":"Nothing like paying $15 a ticket only to have to watch ads blare on a big screen before the movie. I expect to be able to talk to my date before the show, but the ads make it entirely unpleasant. Give us a repreive. Or at least give us some sort of original programming."}
{"text":"This place has seen better days.  The 2 escalators leading up to the theater have been broken for (literally) months, and now one of the elevators is down too.  Just a few flights of stairs, though, so workable for me, but perhaps not for others.  Anyway, we ordered tickets online a week in advance, but when we got to the theater, we learned that our movie had been \"canceled.\"  I've never had this happen before. They did refund the cost of my tickets, but not the $3.50 convenience fee I had to pay when I ordered the tickets online.  That seems unfair since I was greatly inconvenienced at having to travel to the theater to learn my movie was canceled.  Why no email from the theater in advance, which would have saved me the trip?  Basically I paid AMC $3.50 to give them the opportunity to disappoint me.  It worked."}
{"text":"Gross... Make sure to check your silverware.  Accidentally set the silverware in the light and it was covered in food parts and dirty right out of the rolled napkin.  Seating is great but I wouldn't eat the food.  Stick to popcorn and drinks.  Manager was 17 and offered nothing but an apology and two free passes to come back.  Wouldn't do anything toward the bill. See pictures I took of the silverware in the photos. Time for a health inspection?"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Not great service and the movie was 25 minutes late.  Didn't even offer anything to make up for the huge delay.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Comfortable reclining seats in the 21+ theater, while enjoying a glass of wine, sign me up! If only there wasn't a giant wall that cuts off a portion of the screen! I'm a pretty short person so this was even more inconvenient for me. I found myself pushing off the seat to see the screen at times throughout the movie, which is sad. The other rooms don't offer the reclining seats and the seats are a lot more close together so you don't have very much space.  We like going here, 1, because it's really close to our place; 2, you can reserve your seats in advance and avoid lines or having to get to the theater early just to get a good seat; and 3, because they sometimes offer reduced prices (I'm talking $5) for earlier showings. I'm a morning person so this works out great on the weekends! The food isn't the best meal you'll eat, but it does beat standard movie food. However, with all the great restaurant options within walking distance, I'd suggest you save your money on a better meal. I will say that we went to Studio Movie Grill last year and we were not impressed at all. In my opinion, AMC is slightly better. If AMC got rid of the giant walls blocking the screen, this would be my favorite theater."}
{"text":"This is the best movie theater ever. We usually go see movies in the cinema suites if available. Basically you get to watch from the comfort of a la-z boy that reclines. It's also great that there are servers who bring you food and booze. My only complaint would be that the food is not spectacular, but who cares. Just fill up on beer. I'm not sure I can ever go back to a regular theater."}
{"text":"What a nice way to watch a movie! Big comfy seats,Waiter service and refillable popcorn! It was great! The food was good. I don't think that I can enjoy a normal theatre again."}
{"text":"It's awesome to have a movie theater with NO KIDS. It's awesome to have a movie theater where the white trash behind you cannot kick your chair.   Food: better than any other movie theater around. Chicken tenders are awesome, and when I ask for extra ranch dressing, oh boy do they comply.  This is my favorite theater and I cannot say anything better."}
{"text":"I don't know if it is because it's a full moon, or a Monday night or what but tonight it was difficult for me to enjoy my movie because on our right, a couple guys brought their own carrots and on our left, a couple not only brought their own crunchy snacks but also bottled beer...yes bottles of beer! And to top it off, they were smoking off electric cigarettes that each time emitted a blue, LED light and an awful, sickly smoke. REALLY? AMC management really sucks at this location if they are so BLIND and other sensory impaired that they don't see this abuse. And here we are paying all this money not just for tickets but to buy their expensive mediocre food and wine only to be assaulted by this experience. EPIC FAIL AMC."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this theater for a little \"treat yo' self\" as a fun alternative to a regular theater. We like to grab seats in the cinema suites if we can - there's nothing better than feeling like an extra in wall-e as you recline in giant red leather chairs pushing a button for someone to come wait on you as you enjoy fine theatrical entertainment. It is straight up American relaxation.   The drinks are pretty delicious - I would suggest the electric lemonade or the southern slammer. I think my only complaint is the food. For $12 chicken fingers, I would expect more than pre-formed frozen chicken strips that I could get in a high school cafeteria. But I will forgive the chicken strips. Because lounging in those comfy chairs instead of praying someone doesn't sit in front of me in a regular theater with a drink in my hand is totally worth the extra $5 in my world."}
{"text":"As far as movies go, this is one of my favorite theaters in the area! You can always find good deals (ie, buy one get one) and regular movie tickets are very reasonably-priced. The seating is luxurious and extremely comfortable. They keep it very clean and neat. While the food is alright, the prices are way too steep for what they offer. Beers are reasonable and the service the three times I've been has been really friendly inside the theater. The bar, however, is a different story. While never totally full, it takes a very long time to be served. Your best bet is just to order something inside the movie!"}
{"text":"Phew there are a lot of reviews. My wife and kids love the comfy chairs and chicken tenders. Seems crazy to me, but have a real hard time getting them to go to a traditional movie theater now.   BTW my star rating is based on experience,  balanced with hit to the pocket book."}
{"text":"The dine-in theater at AMC is the PERFECT place to take a date.  With dine-in experiences being 18+ there are no children running around.  The food is the same price as a Chili's and they bring it right to your seat while you enjoy the feature.  I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to visit an AMC dine in theater during a house hunting trip. Food was cold. Ordered a margarita that I nick named, \"ass water\". Seriously, the worst thing I have ever tasted. Service was awful."}
{"text":"Was so glad when I found out about this place because I love the Cinema Suites! It is similar to iPic but way less as expensive and just as good, in it's own way. Love how you press the button for service if you want to order and the great seats that recline. The only downside was that the wall in front of us kind of blocked the screen when you reclined the chair. Other then that, love it! I can't go to a regular theater anymore!"}
{"text":"Except for the fact that this theater doesn't have Dr. Pepper, this place rocks!!!  Power reclining leather chairs.  No one is cramped.  Every seat is as roomy as your leather recliner at home...if you have one.  Waiters / Waitresses serve a variety of beverages, alcohol included along with food.  This is the place to see a movie."}
{"text":"First off, the staff is GREAT.  Friendly, professional, and thorough.  Big kudos to whoever hires these folks.  Great brand ambassadors.  The product, however, is just okay.  The food's about the quality you might find at a Chili's in an airport.  It's not bad, it's just nothing you can't get a million of other places.    Then there's the theater.  Great idea.  Needs some fine-tuning.    After getting there, we found out that the movie we wanted to see was showing in a theater without Lazyboy chairs.  (Wish we had known before we bought tix and drove there.)  We wanted to experience the Lazyboys and switched movies.  Upon sitting in our seats, we noticed there was a partition (you can kinda see this in one of the photos here on Yelp) that covered the bottom 20% of the screen. (25% if you're short like one of the women with us.)    Then we tried to order some more food.  Turns out what we wanted was listed in the menu, but only available in select locations - one of which, this was NOT.  So between the food being mediocre, stuff we wanted being unavailable and the theater sightlines being compromised, we left before the film started.  I can't think of a reason to ever go back.  But one more time - the people are terrific.  AMC just needs to give them a better product to represent."}
{"text":"What a great place!  I've been going here for the past year about twice per week.  The facility is always clean and the staff is friendly.  The concept of this theater is nothing but fun. They have a bar located in the lobby with seating if you choose to have a drink while waiting for friends. You can take your drink with you in the movie if you do not finish it.  There are \"2\" theater types. Fork N Screen permits children where \"Cinema Suites\" only permits 21 and over. Both serve the same food & drink menu. The Fork N Screen has more seating but the seats do not recline where the Cinema Suites are far more private and the seats recline. I love the little red help buttons next to each seat if you need service, hit the button and voila... they show up! The food is average, the apps are pretty good, and the drinks are fun. There are really good restaurants located in the Esplande if you choose to have dinner elsewhere and then see a movie.  They also validate for parking for 4 hours!  Overall, this is a great spot for a night alone, date night, girls night, or a family afternoon. AMC also has a stubs program ($12.00 year) I use it to earn points and free dollars to use."}
{"text":"In the past, this WAS the greatest way to see a movie, great menu, surprisingly excellent food, comfortable seats, advanced purchase reserved seating that's effortless... What changed is that the last three visits the food was terrible. The menu is simpler but it's a much lower quality in preparation and ingredients. The Avacado/crab sushi last night did it for me though, it was by far the worst sushi roll I have ever tasted. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome that I literally can't stand to see movies at any other theater now.  I feel like I'm in international first class when I sit in the higher end \"Cinema Suites.\"  I feel like I'm in my living room recliner with a server when I'm in the \"Fork and Screen.\"  So basically, it's awesome.  Most comfortable theater in the Valley hands down.  The food and drinks are pretty good, and not insanely expensive either.  I can't stop going back."}
{"text":"It was 2013 and we decided to come down for mini-vacation from San Diego to see my folks. My parents gave us the a parent's pass that weekend out and so we decided to give this a try from the traditional theater. It was an amazing experience and to be honest we haven't been to another theater since... Moving forward we decided to move to Phoenix from San Diego Spring of this year and we've been coming here at least 2-3 times a month (gotta love the Stubs Rewards). I mean seriously we can nit pick about this and that but when it comes to enjoying a movie that you paid a pretty penny for the last thing you want is some teeny-boppers obnoxious ass talking next you or smacking on their food... Love the freedom of having to reserve your seat in advance and the food/drinks aren't that bad."}
{"text":"I bought tickets and reserved seats 22 hours before the movie. Don't bother doing all that.  I got to my seats and they were taken. Again, I had reserved them- had confirmation emails and codes. Apparently it didn't matter. According to Mario ( a manager but I'm hoping not for much longer) it's first come first serve. We eventually moved to other seats, but the woman who had reserved them wanted us to move. I had yet another bewildering and belittling conversation with MARIO who TOLD us to move. We didn't. Another manager with some actual communication skills found seating for the other displaced party.  Usually I wouldn't care where I sat, but I needed my broken foot elevated.  I was treated condescendingly and very poorly by this untrained and confused Mario.  Will never return to this theatre. Going to I pic from now on."}
{"text":"This is the first dine-in theater I've ever been to, and I love it. For one, the big, cushiony chairs are super comfortable. The first time I came to this theater, about a month and a half ago, I did not realize this is a dine-in theater and was a little surprised to find no concession station in the cinema lobby. At first, when I entered the actual theater for the movie and looked at the menu, I was skeptical. My previous experience with theater food, outside of popcorn, nachos, and soft pretzels, told me that the quality of the food would be low, but then I wasn't pleasantly surprised. The first time I ordered the fire-roasted veggie quesadillas and they were excellent, definitely restaurant-quality. A couple of times I ordered their mushroom Swiss burger and it was excellent. My only complaint is that sometimes when I would ask for a refill for my iced tea and was told that it was coming up, the refill would never appear. Other than this, I have enjoyed my film-viewing experiences here. True, it is slightly more expensive than regular theaters, including the price of admission, but it's a nice change from the regular theater experience. Because of the price, however, I don't go here all of the time when a movie I want to see comes out."}
{"text":"Ugh, I used to love coming to this movie theater and have been for years. The last time we went we were headed to see The Revenant (great movie by the way, from what we could see...read on..) and were placed in theater 5. My boyfriend went to the movies to purchase our tickets a few days in advance and the seats that were available were up higher in the back. So we arrive ready and excited since we normally love this movie theater and we sit down. UMMM to our surprise, we can't see the bottom 25% of the screen like others have mentioned. A block of wall literally blocks your view. I had to sit with my feet underneath me as high as I possibly could just to hopefully be able to see the whole movie. Even then, I couldn't see some of the subtitles. WTH? Who builds the inside of a movie theater like that?  It was also extremely hot in the room. We were sweating throughout the whole movie and that's gross. So much for a relaxing experience.. Service was whatever, but I've been in the service industry so I am more understanding to things like that. We also didn't order food that night so I can't comment on that.  I've had the food there a few times and honestly, it never really bothered me. It wasn't wonderful but it wasn't terrible.  But with this experience, we will never be back. What a waste!! Get your sh*t together"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night - was a little hesitant due to the negative reviews. We saw Batman in the Forks and Screen theater. Loved it! The seats are comfortable (despite what another reviewer said), everything was clean at our seats and our server came by right away like he said he would. We each ordered appetizers and already had drinks from the bar. The food was great! The only negative would be that it's pretty distracting having servers going in and out during the movie. But it's to be expected at a place like this and just something you have to deal with. 4 stars because of price - we had two tickets, two drinks and three apps. It was over $80 - not sure that it's worth that. But good for a once in a while date!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed at this theater! We ordered tickets online for the 3 of us and drove 45 minutes only to find out about the rule of over 21 for the theater with reclining seats. Our daughter that was with us is 17 and accompanied by 2 parents. She's sure not disruptive and was standing there with the manager and was told she couldn't go in because people pay to not be around others under 21. I totally get the rule if kids try to come in as a group of rowdy teens or preteens but I feel like an exception could have been made for this case - especially since the rule isn't spelled out on the website at all. The girl and manager explained you have to hover over an icon to see the rule!! Really - well that's the last time we will come here. How disappointing for our family night out!!"}
{"text":"Love these movie theaters with the lay down seats and service while you watch a movie! Saw The Decendants, great movie great theater!"}
{"text":"I used to give this place 5 stars, but since corporate changed the food I downgraded it. Everything is completely inedible - how do you screw up pretzels?? However, we love the reclining chairs and the staff is amazing - they even know us by name! (Thanks to Simone, Ana and Lindsey!) We had two incidents where the movie was canceled because the fire alarm came on and the power went out, but they quickly gave everyone refunds and free tickets to a future show.  All in all, still great, but please change back the food!!"}
{"text":"Once again disappointing experience at AMC esplanade. No one taking tickets at the entrance (had purchased online and printed) had to ask employee that acted highly disturbed to speak to a customer which theater. Bathroom and theater not clean as usual. Was in knife and fork theater, no wait staff stopped by in two hours or even glanced in our direction. Customer service at this place is virtually non existent. Oh and the escalators once again not working. Not sure why I pay a premium to see a movie here?"}
{"text":"Sushi is absolutely terrible. The tables that are with the seating have been dirty/sticky, along with the menus and silverware. The service is good but the cleanliness is a huge problem."}
{"text":"Contrary to everyone else, we really enjoyed our free movie experience.  Super friendly grand opening staff ... almost bordering on Disney-esque enthusiasm. Hope the energy stays on!  We definitely would come here again, larger seating, quieter atmosphere due to 18+ age group, and decent dining without scary airport-like pricing (entrees $8.99-12.99)...  Food quality is Applebee's level, so set expectations accordingly...  Chicken tenders - run of the mill normal strips, no hint of coconut but there was the odd ponzu sauce.  Battered shrimp - received 7 large tender (not overcooked) shrimp, better but the ponzu sauce is corn syrup scary.  Allowed me to sub the typical fries for a small side salad (romaine).  Chicken fried steak - ok, came w/ hearty portion of mashed red potatoes and snap peas.  Smokey salmon sandwich - would order this again, came with chips  Triple berry stack - unmemorable  Chocolate brownie and ice cream - warm and delicious"}
{"text":"It was so expensive and it was a thin Little burger... nothing like what it shows in the pictures displayed all over the theater. It look like it was just thrown together and it took 45 minutes to receive. I will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"I mean, who doesn't like the idea of being able to sit back comfortably and eat while you watch a movie? This isn't my first time watching here, but this has changed the way I like to watch movies in theaters. Their seats are far more comfortable in my opinion than 'regular' movie theaters and you reserve your spots when you purchase tickets, but note that Not all rooms have recliner seating. I ordered food while here and got their southern style chicken tenders which came with buttermilk biscuits and fries. The tenders were really good and so were the fries, but the biscuits I couldn't eat because they were so hard. Oh well, still enjoyed my experience here and will most likely keep coming back to watch movies. Also, this particular location is garage parking only with a fee, but AMC validates your parking ticket."}
{"text":"I came to see Jurassic World with my boys.   I haven't been here in years but I did like the underground parking options.  It's so hot and parking outside in the summer with leather seats in not a good idea.  There was plenty of parking and we were able to park by the elevator.   We got upstairs and the view is nice you can see camelback mountain.  It's right in front of the Biltmore shops too.   The facility is really nice, they have a seating area and had lots of bottles.  It's nice to relax and watch a movie.  We found our seats right away.  It's reserved seating and we did everything online.  It was very easy and convenient because you just print your tickets and go to your theatre.   The service is good and the food is comparable to Applebee's appetizer menu.  They also have sushi, pizza and burgers.  We got fish and chips, nachos and popcorn.  It's a good options to go watch a movie and eat lunch/dinner.  We got our parking ticket validated and called it a day.  Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"My favorite movie theatre in our neighborhood! I love that we can order our tickets ahead, so that we don't have to arrive early to look for seats. They always play all the latest blockbusters, so you have plenty of movie choices. I love the comfortable seats here, but not all theaters offer the same seating (some recline others don't). They do have a nice variety of food options, but I usually stick to popcorn. The French fries are pretty tasty though so that's a must have. Good service, comfy seats, & good popcorn so you can't go wrong with this theatre."}
{"text":"This is def 1 of my Absolute Favor8 places 2 go every opportunity I can & I'd luv 2 give them a Perfect score but unfortun8ly out of the countless Xs I've been there, my 1st experience there doesn't allow 4 that 2 b the case. Guess it's pretty impressive that out of all those Xs since, it's been nothing but an EXCEPTIONAL experience Every single time in service & food (other than WAY 2 much salt on popcorn once), but it still can't take away what wasn't handled as it should have been 4 the 1st impression. Have dined in both the fork & screen & the Cinema Suites (both r Gr8 but our preference is the Suites: b~n roomier & more luxurious)!     My 1st visit was 4 a special occasion 2 celebr8 the birthday of my very special guest.  Unfortun8ly it never fails, there was a crazy lady seated 2 our left in the row behind us.  I'd like 2 think she had tourette's syndrome but found out rather quickly she was a deliber8 instig8or &/or a bitter attention wh*re hag who was trying 2 ruin every1 else's time, not just immedi8ly around her but in the entire theater. 4 whatever reason (in her head) she put most of her focus upon us.       It was well b4 the previews & the server was explaining everything 2 us while taking our initial order of appetizers & drinks.  She kept clearing her throat way 2 loud whenever any1 was ordering anything but when our server came back w/ our drinks, she loudly said \"Gonna order anymore b*tch?\" right as the noise of the present preview ended.  Every1 including our server looked @ her as she tried 2 play off not saying it while loudly eating her tub of popcorn worse than the cookie monster off Sesamee Street.       We assumed our w8er left 2 notify management but that wasn't the case.  She continued w/ her antics throwing her popcorn & insults all through the final preview & on in2 the start of the movie.  My guest went 2 notify management & 2 c if the w8er was in process of doing so.  I sat there clenching the arm rest trying not 2 turn in2 a She~Hulk while we were missing the opening.      Our w8er was busy tending 2 his orders but confirmed what had happened 2  management which my guest relayed.  Returning, he came back w/ some lady \"manager\" (using that term very loosely) confronting the lady who immedi8ly burst in2 tears playing the victim & claiming she had a headache & would apologize 2 us after the show (like that was supposed 2 make everything ok/understood).      Then the manager approached me & I told her if that woman didn't like the fact that this was a dine~in cinema she could go 2 a regular theater (as she's still chowin' down on her popcorn like nothing happened~crocodile tears dried) & that we were in no way being loud or disruptive (unlike her).  We were told not 2 talk 2 her & that \"she said she'd apologize 2 us after the movie.\"  We're thinking, What?? So ur not going 2 take care of the problem that the entire theater was having 2 deal w/ & then tell US not 2 talk 2 her when nothing warranted this HARASSMENT of US & some1 trying 2 ruin things 4 others?  Sorry, that's NOT good enough!!      The PROBLEM should have been REMOVED/had 2 LEAVE especially since the w8er confirmed what happened as the entire theater could.  It SHOULD have been CORRECTED even if it meant giving psycho lady off~her~meds a refund!!  Sad part is that doesn't even apply 2 her as everything was so blatantly intentional.  Part of HER PROBLEM trying 2 project on2 others seems 2 b she had an issue w/ others ordering from the menu while she only had popcorn.  And if she wasn't such a nasty miserable being, we might have actually paid anonymously 4 her 2 select something 4 herself.       Shame on that so~called \"manager\", thus the 4 instead of 5* rating!!  The only apology we got was from our server (we didn't care 2 hear from the wierdo lady who should b gr8ful we're the people we r instead of following her 2 her car or residence) but replied \"unfortun8ly we can't control the actions/behavior of others but something can b done when these situ8ions/nuisances present themselves & SOMETHING should have been!\"  Then a couple following behind us on the way out of the theater said \"oh yeah that crazy lady was Horrible, WE almost left ~ Absolutely NO excuse 4 that!\"  Glad 2 know obviously we weren't the only 1s feeling that way..."}
{"text":"I am torn about this theater. Yes the seats are super huge and comfy but I am not sure if it helps the movie experience. If you are on a date its really hard to be cozy without acting like you are in bed.  The food is not very good."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, I really do. We come here all the time, it's convenient because we live right down the street.  The food, tastes good, but is overpriced and hit or miss if you get it hot.  We went this last weekend for Rogue One, saw it on Sunday.  The first thing I noticed was that despite the fact the theatre remodel is less than 5 years old, had the seats were covered in duct tape due to rips and wear, while not a big deal, as expensive as the place is, makes it seem a bit rundown.  The server tried really hard and for the most part did a good job, but the kitchen was not prepared, they ran out of not one, but both of the meals my wife wanted and by the time they figured that out, the rest of us had finished our food.  We have had other times when the server was more concerned about getting paid than providing actual service. This place really needs to step it up if they want to be worth the price otherwise I'll just go downtown.  The ONLY thing I like about this place at this point is the reserved seating..."}
{"text":"I just love this theater! It's made going to the movies fun again!!  I highly recommend the cinema suites experience if you can swing it... Big reclining chairs coupled with a great theatre food & drink menu, make it the ultimate way to catch the latest flick! (also, the cinema suites are adults only!)  I also recommend buying your tickets in advance online.  If you go to see more than a couple of movies a year, I would also consider joining the AMC stubs program, which waves of the online ticket fee, and gives you money back for $$ spent on tickets and concession items.  It costs $12/year to be a member, but I've made way more than that back in the year I've had it!  Oh and if you've got a sweet tooth, I would suggest ordering the ice cream waffle sundae with bacon bits... Yum!   TIP: Always remember to bring your parking stub from the garage downstairs up to the theater to be validated!"}
{"text":"From parking to credits. The theater is not hard to find, however the parking is not cheap. I entered a parking garage labled theater and shop parking, over 70% of the spots were reserved so that was the first frustration... As you enter it says 1$per 20 min... Max 12$. After parking getting through the snake of stairs and elevators was rediculas. One set of elevators says not to use if you're a patron to the theatre and to use the staircase on the west end.  Then you go down a flight of stairs find another parking garage, go up a flight of stairs find an elevator around the corner and then you're finally at the entrance.  The movie we saw said start time at 1:30, no where on the website did it say to arrive early so we got there at 130. When we sat down at 135 the previews were playing and all the lights were off. The only light is a small dim light on the corner of the chair. I decided that I wanted to order the bbq brisket Mac and cheese for 13$ and an $8 blue moon. When it arrived the bowl was cold, the noodles were undercooked, and there was about 3 bites of dry hard brisket. The only thing good about the experience was the blue moon and the waiter who was pleasant for only being able to say few words while the movie played. So much potential in this but it fell soooo short"}
{"text":"Awesome. The place is well kept and I can't wait to go their again. The prices are good and the service is excellent! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A fun film to watch, \"Secret Life of Pets.\" Great sound quality, perfect size of the screen and color in the film. That is the main reason why I added the third star. I have to say the worst experience ever in any theater we have ever experienced in our life time. Sad..... Comfortable seating, good sushi, & wine. It was difficult to see what we were eating because by the time we got our food the movie started and it was dark. Very expensive food and the service is not so great. Staff look like they don't want to be there and I was ignored when I stood by the bar waiting for service.  Two bartenders there who looked like they didn't want to be there and neither did the staff. I noticed two of the staff there kept looking at me as if I was going to steal something. No greeting or a smile or are you being helped? ...the waiter who served our food was almost on top of everything.  He was friendly and not slow and he knew what he was doing. Another staff person there was helpful too to let me know more about the theater. She was friendly and helpful. I have to say the experience we had with the manager there was pretty rude. We got there to meet with a non-profit organization and we were not able to find them. We had thought we had arrived to the wrong theater that day. All the staff there had no idea there was an event and neither did the manager. She looked on her list and didn't see the organization event on there. One of the cashiers there was helpful and even contacted the manager to find out what was going on. When we were about to leave we ran into the gal who is the owner of the organization. It was the correct theater and we walked back inside. We bought our tickets and my good friend saw the manager and approached her to let her know that the non profit organization was there and he pointed out where our table was just in case other people came in and could not find us. The manager's comment back was, \"...we DON'T have any event here!, ....they sure didn't buy tickets from us!\" she walked away. WTF! ....seriously? The non-profit organization did buy tickets from them. It was a very unprofessional rude comment that she made. We didn't want to let our fun evening go sour as it already did when we first arrived. I really don't think we plan to return."}
{"text":"Movie time!  We went to see \"Chef\"  what a great movie!  The food this time however left much to be desired.  I always have the Thai Bang Shrimp Tacos and this time the corn tortillas were old and dried out, and there was almost no shrimp to speak of.  My hubby had the Coconut chicken tenders and he did like those.  The rest of the experience was good as usual and this will not prevent us from coming back.  I just may ask this time if they changed the recipe."}
{"text":"After hearing about it for a while, we were very excited to try this theater for their food, drinks and movie. We made reservations online and got perfect seats which is a big plus. Front row=I don't go.   It's awesome to be able to sit down and order food when you're cutting it close on time for a movie. I was a little disappointed by the menu - it reminded me of a bar menu and nothing really jumped out at me. The waitress took my order before the previews - a chicken wrap and popcorn. The chicken wrap came about 15 minutes later and was decent.   The popcorn took 45 MINUTES. When we inquired about the popcorn, we were scolded with \"it's not my department\" from the waitress. By the time it came we were over it, so the $7/free refill deal is a joke considering the service is so slow.   Garage parking is free with validation.  I would go again just because the seating is so comfortable, but I would rather eat before!"}
{"text":"In credible seats....well worth the the ticket price.  The food is overpriced and some is much better than others.  Nice for going on a date night!"}
{"text":"Just went to see the hobbit marathon on mon and I got to say if I spent a whole day at a movie theater it would be at the amc esplanade 14 dine in theater the seats comfortable (even though there not cinema suite seats!) the service was great and super friendly and helpful and the food was even better from the drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts I love this place I'd go everyday if I could I and would suggest this to anyone who wants a great movie experience."}
{"text":"I think the concept of AMC Esplanade 14 is great and the remodel is definitely looking nice but honestly,  the last thing I want while i'm sharing a room with far too many strangers is the smell of someones Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar lingering from behind me for two hours. Can't we enjoy movies with a drink, Red Vines, and popcorn anymore? Why do you need a New York Strip while you watch Prometheus?  I just don't get it. 3D movie plus a huge meal= vomit. Just saying.  Plus, who wants someone (servers) walking back and forth, back and forth, yada yada.. while you are trying to watch a movie? They do a great job of being quiet, courteous, etc.. but over all the service is just ok. We told our server before we ordered that my boyfriend and I were on a separate check from a friend and he still only brought us one check. Super annoying.   I say, if you are going to have a menu keep it small. They have tons of drink options that seem like they would be great but again, I doubt I'll down a margarita in a movie theatre. I promise I'm not boring. Hell, maybe I am.   I'm sure many people will rave about this and go on and on about how great it is to ring your server 5 times during a movie for more food... god. But this just isn't for me. I'll go and I'll bring my own Milk Duds and Red Vines. Don't tattle."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would! The customer service could be a lot better. Ask to speak to the manager regarding a issue with my waitress and the manager was very rude. He refused to let me speak and was very condescending! Don't even waste your time trying to contact corporate because they will never get back! Plus if you happen to be in one of the later movies, you'll surely catch most of the staff just hanging out at the bar and talking story about their personal lives for all to hear! No wonder it takes 30-45 min for my soda to come! When this theatre first started at this location many years ago it was good and lately I'm not sure if it's new staff or just complacency but this place has really declined! Do not go here! Go to anywhere else but this place! Seriously!!! Anywhere else!!! You've been warned!"}
{"text":"I went to see \"X-men: Days of Future Past\" 3D in one of the Cinema Suites. The powered recliners are AWESOME! I was in row D, but in the future will only sit in lower rows as you can't fully recline without cropping out some of the bottom part of the screen. The theater was about 70% full by my estimation (25-30 people) and based on other reviews I was certainly worried about noise from people ordering food, etc. However, I found it to be a non-issue. It was maybe a little noisy for the first 10-15 mins of the movie, but it was so minimal that it's barely remarkable. There's such a drop in height from one row to the next that I think it prevents one from really being bothered by what's going on in rows that are in front/behind them. Also, I didn't feel that it was really any brighter after the movie started than it would be at any other \"regular\" theater. However, the little call/menu light was reflecting off of the inside of my 3D glasses. So, I took the cloth napkin and had it covering the light for most of the movie. For non-3D movies, I don't think this would be a problem. I ordered the Jalapeno Chipotle Burger with Parmesan Fries and it was HUGE and also pretty tasty. Not the best burger I've ever had, but good.The servers were really attentive, but not annoying. All in all, I was pretty impressed and feel that the $6-7 mark-up over a traditional first-run theater ticket is worth it, even if you don't get anything to eat."}
{"text":"Recently my uncle rented out a theatre at this location to celebrate my aunts 55th birthday! This would be this first time I've been to this theatre since they changed it into the dine-in movies. Lets just say I was very impressed! A few family members showed up early to set things up but when we arrived the staff was already on top of it! We requested to play a short video as soon as all the guests arrived and the staff had no problem accommodating that request. As the guests arrived the friendly staff walked around taking drink orders and quickly returned with the beverages and continued to take orders and help out with anything we requested. After a few minuets of greeting each other we sat down in our huge comfy recliners and started our private viewing of Iron man 3. During the beginning of the film the wait staff walked around taking food orders from the guests, we were given a fixed menu to choose our meals from. We had the option on a chicken quesadilla or loaded potato skins to choose from for an appetizer, and for the main course we could choose from four different burgers or a chicken Ceaser wrap (all options came with a choice or house made potato chips or french fries). I ordered the potato skins as my appetizer and the bacon cheese burger with french fries as my main meal. The potato skins were very good... not amazing but defiantly better that what I expected. Burger and fries were average.   The bar is pretty expensive... 40+ $ for a bottle of wine? 10+$ for a glass? That's okay if I'm fine dinning but get real... The wine selection wasn't even that great.   All in all the service was fantastic and the food was better than expected (but not wonderful)... Ill be back."}
{"text":"Horrible. They bring out my Jim beam wrong first go around. Then 15 minutes later our water and iced tea come out. This is after they bring us an order of wings that was wrong. Then the wings come back and they're ice cold!  We get those removed for some average popcorn and it comes with three sides of melted butter when it's already swimming in butter wth??  The waitress just stopped coming by and had other people drop off our stuff. We only saw her again when she dropped off the check that after all of that really should've been taken care of since it was only the soda tea and a shot of Jim beam. The soft drinks are 5.20!  Stay away. Shit service couldn't speak to the food."}
{"text":"What a great way to watch a movie!! We got to do the dinner theater, which cost $12 per ticket. Huge oversized stuffed chairs, great service. They, suprisingly, had a great well rounded menu for food and a full bar. I didn't have any drinks, but I did snag  an order of fish and chips with an ice tea that was perfect while watching a good movie. All in all, super fan!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Danny and I love going to the movies, but this was our first Dine-in theaters. He loved the idea and ordered popcorn from our seats. We were able to make a 745 PM showing, even though we showed up right at 745 PM. It was a Thursday night, but the service was great and the usher that helped us to our seat was also really nice. I tried to order a drink at the full bar and that is where I wasn't greeted for a couple minutes. (No smile, no acknowledgement) It felt a little awkward and I almost left to go back to my seat. The bartender took my order brought my drink but took another couple minutes to charge my card to go. She proceeded to get other orders, not sure what they're protocol is, but I think it can be improved for timings sake. I wasn't an angry customer but I could tell you that another person or two were annoyed/not happy. Regardless, I came back to my seat and Danny was already enjoying his popcorn and next time I will just order from the seat! Much easier with less hassle!"}
{"text":"The last few times we have been here the theatres auditorium was still dirty from the previous showings. I have always had really good service but the cleanliness is a real issue, especially considering that I have noticed and that is without the lights on. I also will caution you that the seats anywhere other than the cinema suites recliners are uncomfortable during long movies."}
{"text":"A Nice Change. Unique Experience. Food & Movie Experience Simultaneously. I sat in Fork & Screen for the matinee (only $6 per person). Other people said they had bad customer service in fork & screen, but I received awesome customer service. I got there before the movie started and placed my order during the previews. My food came out quick and Diner quality (tasty, but probably not awesome quality).   Quick Note Regarding Parking: Park behind the movie theatre, by where it says AMC & Shops. The movie theatre will validate your parking for 4 hours of FREE parking.   If you are a shopper....You can walk the underground path to the Biltmore mall afterwards for some quick shopping."}
{"text":"I have had high expectations for Esplande, but very bad management, hospitality and the timing on delivering food. My friend and I came to watch Black Panther 20 minutes before the movie started ordered our drinks and dinner, we could not enjoy the movie since we were waiting for our service... an hour later into the movie NOTHING yet. Went to check what was going on and still the staff scrambling on the food and drinks. Highly recommend coming to this theatre to just WATCH a movie and not DINE-IN."}
{"text":"Once you go to the movies here, you will never go to the normal movie theater again.  So nice to have a drink while watching the movie."}
{"text":"Other dine-in theaters around town are nicer...(your seats totally recline...but NOT here).   Food is pricey for the quality (and very carb- as you would expect)...and the DRINKS....wooooo $18 for a 3/4 full vodka martini and seemed watered down.  OUCH and BOOOO!  You can't beat $5 Tuesday though....that saved a star."}
{"text":"Seemed like a good idea on a hot day. Found out shortly after the previews started the AC wasn't working properly. It was cooler than being stuck outside in 117 degree heat. Had a tall beer and a recliner so I top a nap."}
{"text":"This was the worst food ever!!!  My husband and I both ended up sick the next day with food poisoning from the chicken we ate.  I would expect a lot more for the prices they charge for food/drinks.    I made a complaint about the experience which was never followed up on.  For a company as large as AMC I had hoped for better customer care practices."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and with the exception of my last visit, it has been a great experience (hence 4 stars). The difference between the Fork and Dine and the Cinema Suites is like business class vs. first class. Both are great but ones a little more plush. Food is good, service is good, it's comfortable,fun and a nice way to have lunch or dinner, a cocktail and a movie. I will continue to enjoy going here."}
{"text":"haven't been to a dine in for years.  the seats were comfortable but the food was horrible.  ordered a Quesada and it was soggy on the bottom.  the service was wasn't good at all.  when asked for an extra plate, the girl  who brought the food said \"you ask your server for that\" and very abrupt.  the server came eventually with a plate.  we were surrounded by several people and we got our food/drinks last.  i can understand if it takes longer to cook but it wasn't good.  $16 for a Quesada?  two pieces?  are you kidding.  prices really very high for everything and definitely not worth it.  the place looked like a ghost town and the theater is hard to find.  will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and nearly every time has been a total disappointment. Uncomfortable seats, theaters that smell like rotting food, the sound of falling forks and smacking lips the whole time, waiters running through the theater during movies... I understand the concept but man is it a terrible execution."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy do I like this theater... I must since I've probably dropped over $100 here in the past month between the 25 minute drive, the ticket price, and food; but I've got to say it's worth every penny!  In the past month, the Hubs and I have frequented the AMC Fork and Screen twice and have had the best experiences.  By combining two of my favorite activities, food and movies, AMC has made me one happy girl.  Ever since Farrelli's closed, we've been craving a similar experience.  Now with SMG and Fork and Screen we are set!  The service at this theater is great.  I love the fact you press one button and can get anything you want.  The food selection is good - chili's quality, but perfect for the movie and dining experience.  I've liked most everything I've eaten with the exception of the chicken fingers, which really tasted by McDonald's mcnuggets (which I usually like, but wasn't expecting here).  The tacos and pizza were great and overall, can't beat the prices.  The soda price is a little high, but that's ok you can get refills during the movie.  The seats/ atmosphere are awesome and everything is clean and new.  I can say without a doubt we'll be back... you can pick your seats in advance and have a no-hassle dinner/movie experience... what more could you want!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst movie theater in town!!! Even when you call in multiple times for information, they cannot provide it, or worse yet they lie to you so that when you show up to purchase your reserved ticket from 30 minutes before and there are no seats left. Their min wage employees do not care about how quickly they are running this theater into the ground, they're just waiting around to go home."}
{"text":"ok this place is really nice and fancy!me and my friend is been coming to this place 2 or 3 times a week i dont mine spending that much money because i really enjoy coming to this place and its close in my house.but for the past 6 months have raise the price!it was 9.50 each person then.then it became 12.00 each person then on new year it was 13.00 dollars already that is abusing customers and taking advantage the people!we wont be back in this place anymore...they lost us as a customer!"}
{"text":"This is how to watch a movie. Recline, order you meal and wine and enjoy. It's the service and theater experience that we lost. Love it. The 3d movies are excellent. Saw Guardians of the Galaxy in 3d. Awesome!!!! Don't just pick make sure you are in the full service nice  theaters"}
{"text":"My first time was my last time. I may have to go see Atomic Blonde at another theater because I was so distracted by the awfulness of this place  The seats are horrible. They are barely an upgrade from the hard tiny theater seats of the 80s. These seats are naturally reclined at the strangest angle so that as a 5'4\" woman my feet are slightly off the ground and my back is awkwardly arched as I am leaned back in the seat. It's not relaxing at all. In fact, sitting forward on the edge of the seat is so much better - but not really for 2 hours.   The tiny incandescent bulbs used to read the menus are on throughout the entire movie and high enough that they nag at my peripheral vision the entire time. It was horribly distracting.   The crab and avocado roll had the worst chemical smell to it that my wife and I both noticed as soon as it was brought to us. On top of that, when the server handed it to me, there was something slimy and crusty all over the bottom of the plate. Imagine wondering what the hell that is in the dark.   Lastly, right in the middle of an intense scene, the lights suddenly came on in the theater. Then about a minute later, they just as suddenly shut off. What a nice touch.   Not one single thing about this place impressed me.  I'd never return."}
{"text":"This place has comfortable chairs but I found a few things very irritating....  They started the show half hour late, for that half hour there was nothing being played on the screen... They delayed to deliver ppl's order... Also, during the show, servers were walking up and down to service ppl's request and blocking view of the screen... This totally kills the experience... The ticket is pricier than regular AMC theaters but the experience is worse... I am never coming here again"}
{"text":"Tasteless and bland foods that will send you to an early grave. The food here is so bad that it completely detracts from the romanticism behind the idea of dining out and watching a movie at the same time. The food here is seriously bad and expensive. As if paying for bad food with your wallet wasn't bad enough you will also be paying for this food on the treadmill because just about every dish is within a short range of 1000 calories! Keep a careful eye out for the calorie listings on the menu if you go in. Terrible and unhealthy foods aside, I must say it wouldn't be a bad place to go for a dessert. I would not recommend going here for drinks though, since they are so expensive.  Friendly and attentive employees and waitstaff."}
{"text":"Love the concept! Dinner & drinks all while you watch a movie on the big screen! I'd been once before a couple years ago & remember really loving it! This time was just as enjoyable but only because of my date. Our server was also nice & efficient! The downfall was the theater was so dirty! There were crumbs on my seat & our tables. There was trash on the floor & the menus were sticky! It was surprising the state it was in. I liked my food but my husband wasn't happy the fries came room temperature. To be honest I don't think we'll go back. It's a nicer experience to get dinner somewhere else & go to a regular, clean theater."}
{"text":"The service and food was terrible!!! The food was cold. The fries was old and hard. The waiter took forever to bring drinks!!!! I couldn't even enjoy my movie!!! It was TERRIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"I would have given zero stars if it was allowed.  The Theatre is dirty, the concessions MUST be ordered through a waiter, who stands in front of you during the movie while the show is playing..  They also have a wall in front of each row, and sitting in the back row, the wall blocked 1/3rd of the screen, so the subtitles could not be read if you were reclined, and you have to crane your neck when sitting upright to see the bottom of the screen. This is true for any of the seats in the upper section, back from the screen. This Theatre was built several years ago and it shows it's age.  I would not recommend it, the Harkins at Scottsdale Fashion Square is much nicer, clean and you can get your own concessions.  When I complained about this viewing problem, the client service staff never got off their chairs and acted as if they could care less, so I asked to speak to the manager, and she was even less helpful.  Really horrible experience."}
{"text":"We loved going to this theatre when it first opened - having food and drinks during the movie was novel to us. Our first visit back in a couple of years was really disappointing. We arrived early (15 minutes) to order drinks and dinner to take in. There being no food menus in the lobby area we got wine (which took almost 10 minutes even though there was no line). Once in the theatre, we pressed our button to order and waited. The couple in front of us had already been waiting 15 minutes and (about 10 minutes apart) we separately approached theatre staff to request service (or to order). It took over 30 minutes for the wait staff to make an appearance in our section, while other sections had multiple staff in each.  Separately, I didn't recall how little room there is between rows. I couldn't cross my legs without having to be very careful to avoid kicking the back of the seat in front of me - and my seat was kicked throughout the movie.  We won't be back soon if at all. There are other options in the area."}
{"text":"Our Favorite Theater Experience Love the reclining seats, waiters, are really friendly and helpful. You've must try this place.  The only reason I don't give it a 5 star was the food. This was the second time we visited this theater and the second time the food wasn't the high-light. From now on when we go it's drinks and desert. Our thought is if we are going to spend $15 a meal not including drinks we really want to love the food."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying we've been going to the Esplanade for years, even before it was a Dine-In theater but we've experienced the Cinema Suites side 24 times now (by looking at my AMC Stubs) since it became Dine-In.  It was great when it first opened and I would even say up until this last year.  We moved to Florence a year ago and even still we drive out to Phoenix just to come to the Esplanade for a night out of dinner & a movie.  The movie quality is consistently good but I have got to say, if you are going there for the novelty of eating dinner while you watch a movie....just don't waste your money.  Or order popcorn or some candy, something that they cannot screw up.  This last visit on 8/11/15 might very well be our \"last\" visit to this theater.  The chairs were dirty and even had popcorn still sitting on the seat, not even brushed off.  The menus were sticky and/or slimy depending which page you were on, just absolutely filthy.  Our server did do a good job, so I have no complaints about him and the tip we left reflected his job but definitely not the food quality.  We ordered an appetizer and dinners x 3.  My friend ordered the tenderloin tips which he said were very much over cooked.  I ordered chicken tenders which honestly, how do you screw up chicken tenders?  Apparently if you want to find out, contact whoever works the fryer at AMC Esplanade.  The \"tenders\" were rock hard, overcooked chunks of chicken jerky.  I'm not expecting 5 star quality food, but when you spend $90 (including tip) for an appetizer, 3 dinners and 3 non-alcoholic drinks, you should get something a little higher quality than \"I'm too drunk to taste this\" greasy bar food.  The only positives and which is why I'm giving them two stars is for movie choices/quality, ability to pre-purchase seats (reserved seating) and our servers have been helpful."}
{"text":"This WAS our go to date night spot when we needed to squeeze in dinner and a movie in a few hours.  We drove from Gilbert, just to come here.  However, after this last visit, we will not be back.  We will most likely go back to Studio Movie Grill, even though they don't have reclining seats.    The menu changed the last time we came.  It was very short and not a lot of options.  I immediately thought maybe we accidentally got fork and dine menus, nope these are the new cinema suites menus!  The food was way overpriced.... $16 for mediocre fish and chips.  No thank you!  I ordered a $8 milkshake, it tasted like they left a pint of chocolate ice cream out to melt then poured it into a glass....awful!    The service this last time sucked!  Our food was taking forever, so we hit the button to figure out what the problem was and it took 10 minutes for someone to come.  Because of how late our food was, we didn't order popcorn....  The only nice thing about this theatre are the comfy reclining seats, but not worth the crappy food and service.  Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I like the idea of being able to dine and have cocktails at the movies. The only problem I have is these AMC theaters aren't very clean. Seems they need an update. The carpet is dirty and worn. The experience is fun, but it's very pricy so I am expecting a current and clean space"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go out for date night recently and thought we would give this a try. Here's my recommendation, if you want to do dinner and a movie, pick a good restaurant, eat your dinner and then go see a movie... preferably at a Harkin's Theater.  We hadn't seen a movie here since they turned it into a dinner theater so we thought we would give it a try. First of all, you can't even talk to a human ticket seller without paying to join the AMC VIP club. Luckily, they give you a discount the first time you do, so it didn't cost too much extra.  The theater itself was tiny, like the little shopping mall multiplexes from the 80's. In fact, I'm pretty sure that there are houses in the Biltmore or Paradise Valley with bigger home theaters and better screens. And yes, the seats were fairly comfortable but not all that great.  As for the food, we were not impressed at all. I had a hamburger and fries which were just boring and my wife had the chicken fingers which she said had little to no flavor, despite the menu description and endorsement of our server. Sure I was able to drink a beer, but that didn't make up for the poor food.  Well at least we got to see a movie right? True, but the sound quality was terrible. I noticed that they didn't play the Dolby intro at the beginning of the film and it's clear that the theater did not have surround sound. All of the sound appeared to be coming from speakers at the front of the room and nothing from the side or behind which was a big disappointment when you are trying to see a musical like La La Land.  Overall I was very disappointed in the experience and will not be returning and would not recommend anyone else waste their money at this location."}
{"text":"I love this place. The seating is the reason to go here.  My favorite auditorium is not the one with the reclining seats that practically lay down.  You can't see the full screen because of the wall between the rows.  The bottom of the screen is out of view.  I like the one without the half wall between the rows.  No obstructions.  Movie theater popcorn is not what is used to be.   But, theirs is ok, not fabulous, but ok.  Free refills though and so are the large drinks.  I guess that makes up for it.  Buy in advance, it's a breeze to get it, validate your parking and you're in like Flynn!  I wouldn't go anywhere else to see a movie since this is an option."}
{"text":"This is an OK place to watch a movie.  I like it because it's close by, usually has the films I want to see and it's relatively clean - although the other day I did step on gum in the theater.  Ugh.  Nice selection of corporate pre-date chow in the area, too.  Downsides are the film selection and parking layout.  The film selection could involve more creativity.  Why are they showing 3 screens of Pirates.  Is that really necessary?   I think AMC could show an indie film or two - I think the Biltmore / Central Phoenix types would really eat it up.     I find the parking set-up to be fine, really.  But for the first-timer used to parking in a flat parking lot and walking straight into the theater it might be a bit confusing - because it's all urban, mixed-used development parking garage and stuff.  The stairs leading out of the garage to the walkway of the theater is REALLY confusing.  I can never remember which alternating staircase I took or which floor I'm on - Gila Monster, or Cactus Wren?  Hmmmm."}
{"text":"We went here to watch \"The Book Of Henry\" ,and also wanted to get dinner along with our movie. We were very pleased to find that there was a small slide out tray big enough to put many dishes of food on. The service was very fast, and we got our food about 5 to 10 minutes into the movie. When the food arrived it was very warm and luckily not cold. Overall, the food was above and beyond to be something that was served in a dine in theater. I got the country style chicken and biscuits along with French fries and red slaw. The service was great, and things that we needed were quickly brought to us. For dessert I had the chocolate brownie milkshake. It was  rich and creamy, and the brownie was very delicious. The brownie could have been served by itself as a dessert and still would have impressed. Nicely pulled of meal overall. The only things negative I'd have to say about the food and the theater was that the seats did not recline whatsoever, and there was not enough sauce to go along with the meal. But, I still was impressed by the first experience of going to the AMC Dine In Theater!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to see movies, so for my birthday he took me here because it was highly recommended. I had such an amazing time! It was so nice to go to a theater where anyone under 18 had to be accompanied by an adult. It cuts down on the obnoxious teenager factor. The service was amazing. I was skeptical at first because I thought that servers walking around was going to disturb the movie but it didn't. The food was great and we loved that you could order food in the lobby while you wait for your movie. I just have 3 complaints: the ticket prices are so expensive, but considering they have to pay wages to the servers, I get why they increase the tickets, but still, $20 is a bit much. They also don't have student discounts to lower those prices. My last complaint is that the movie selection isn't as high as some of the other theaters so it was difficult to find a movie that both my husband and I wanted to see. So 4 stars for me because of the down sides, so an overall good time for me."}
{"text":"I will inevitably return to this place since it is the closest theater to me, but now I know what to expect for next time. I got an aisle seat and ordered some grub. I picked some coconut tenders, thinking they would be an easy finger food during the movie. At $13 (and another extra $1 for my truffle fries), I was very surprised that the tenders were just like longer versions of chicken mcnuggets and I didn't bother eating them. The truffle fries were pretty good though my waiter didn't seem to care that what I thought of the tenders either. Also, they charge you the regular movie theater price for coke - around $5. I figured at $5, it would come in a big cup like regular movie theaters or whatever. Oh, no, it comes in a restaurant sized coke glass filled to the top with ice and very little soda. They sometimes give you refills. I say sometimes because around 40-50 minutes before the movie ended, my waiter asked me if I wanted a refill. I said sure. 20 minutes later when he brought the check, he said it was \"coming soon\", but I never got it. I don't mind returning to watch movies, but dinner is another story."}
{"text":"I am an AMC MovieWatcher... and I have the card to prove it!  I always catch the before-noon shows because they are only $5- even for new releases. The perfect treat for an early morning. The theatre is clean and there is usually a line but I skip right to the self-serve kiosks and get my tickets right away.  Also, sign up for the MovieWatchers' club. You can earn points and get discounts on snacks, free popcorn, candy and even movie tickets. I've cashed in on a couple free movie nights already.   The concession stand moves slow. I wish sometimes the kids at the counter would just move a bit faster to get our things,especially when there is a long line. However, they are really good about upselling.   The butter factory is clean and works! The jalapenos for the nachos are fresh and packed in its separate containers which makes it easy and I don't have to fish around a container of juice and soggy jalapenos for them.  The seats are comfortable and leave me with plenty of leg room, not that I need a lot of room but at least I know its there. It is a bit chilly so bring a light sweater.   I haven't tried any restaurants nearby because it seems like there isn't any marketing for any. Most people come here just for the movies.  Oh yeah and don't forget to validate because if you didn't, the gate guards will make you go back to get it."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times I love this place! Friendly staff, clean facilities and yummy food."}
{"text":"I will say the theatre is overall a success. Dine-in theatres seem to be trending nowadays instead of the uncomfortable rows of old, and even with several competitors now sitting in the Valley, the Esplanade hasn't changed much. Which may not be a good thing.  Tickets will be a little pricier due to the couch seating and the opt-in dining service. Unlike some of the recently renovated theatres, the seats don't recline, but there's plenty of cushion to make it work. The tables swing in from the side like a desk, and there's a call button behind you on one of your sides.  The food selection is actually good. I think it's better than Studio Movie Grill myself, just think of an Applebee's that doesn't suck. They can swipe your card when you order and you'll get a check near the end of the movie.  With dine-in theatres you have an expectation. Inevitably someone will drop their forks on the floor, and you'll have to deal with people constantly walking around to bring your orders. Then it starts getting a little mediocre. Service to me has been slower compared to other dine-in theatres. Last couple times I go here, sometimes it'll take up to 10 minutes for a call. Which I get when it's busy, but sometimes I don't see any movement at all.   Well at least there's validated parking. But even with a sick bar and a clean theatre, Esplanade feels complacent to me."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this theater but it definitely needs some fine tuning. The food was on par with Applebee's. (Maybe? Haven't eaten there in years) Our drinks were decent and my husband had free refills on his Arnold Palmer. The brownie sundae was ah.may.zing. Seriously shocked and would probably return just for that. The seats are fantastic. The real issue is the service. Everyone we encountered had the look and service skills of an awkward high schooler. It took forever for anyone to respond to your button in the theater and then another forever for whatever it was you ordered to arrive. Also how do they not have touch screen ordering? It's so distracting trying to talk to someone in the middle of a movie when there is plenty of affordable technology to make it a much smoother experience."}
{"text":"I went to watch the new Star Wars movie Wednesday night and was highly disappointed that AMC would allow 29 minutes of previews!!!! The movie didn't start until more than a half hour after the advertised start time. Totally unacceptable!! AMC is a big corporation and should not subject anyone to that much of a delayed start.   While it's hard to beat the big screen experience, it's no wonder why people just wait to watch movies at home!"}
{"text":"Had a business meeting down in Biltmore and decided to come here with some co workers and wasnt all that i thought it would be, prices were too high and traffic was terrible"}
{"text":"Very limited selection of movies and seats. To sit at the luxury side to watch a movie was $16.50 plus tax. For this price you basically get an assigned leather plush reclinable couch seat with tray and cup holders. You also have a server who takes your food and drink order. Just push the service button - like the button you push at your seat on a plane. The theatre was cold so the cloth napkin was of great use to cover my lap. Ordered a hot cup of cappuccino for $5 and their only one size popcorn $8.50 come in a large square bowl. It didn't taste as fresh.  Either my hearing is really great or the movie sounds was extra loud - I think might have gotten slightly deaf. Would I come back? Um not so sure. My couch and the comfort of my home would have been a sweeter deal for that moment."}
{"text":"The seats are great and the concept is great, but the service is unfortunate. I usually let things slide because I don't know how busy it may be, if they're short-staffed, or something else outside of the staff's control, but this has been a common experience. I saw Pitch Perfect 2 here a few months ago and they completely forgot to put in our food order so we got it when the movie was nearly done. I just saw Suicide Squad and they didn't put in my food again, brought me the wrong drink, said they would rectify it, never did and then charged me for the incorrect drink. Often it takes about 30-40 minutes to get a drink so you should order right when you get yours if you want another one during the film. The staff are friendly, but the responsiveness and delivery for orders is absolutely horrible!"}
{"text":"Stopped at this place to watch IT and the experience was horrible from the moment we walked in. The young gal at the customer service desk clearly did not want to be there. After a very long wait to get service we ordered only to have our drinks come out 20 minutes later. Half of our food order finally made it out well into the movie. The call buttons are useless as no one bothered to stop by even though our call light was on during the entire film. The only other time our waiter came by was to drop off the check. I told him I hadn't received my order and his response was, \"yes you did.\" I would never return to such a hyped place. Definitely NOT recommended."}
{"text":"I dont know what's worse... Not being greeted by the grungy boring staff at the bar or paying $8 for 5 quarter size boneless wings...its safe to say i will not be returning to this once great location, as everything has gone downhill since my last visit here.   This is the biltmore for God's sake, you have an image of being a high class establishment in a well to do area. Guess that doesnt matter anymore considering every staff member i saw needed to take a shower and brush their hair.  And when you work at the bar its good to engage with the customers and maybe smile a lil bit.   Also we bought tickets for a movie that surprised everyone as being 3D, when that was not indicated on the tickets we bought. I hate 3D movies because they make me sick and my eyes dont adjust well which makes a lot of the movie hard to watch and out of focus. Also if you want to recline in your seat you might want to rethink that, because you wont be able to see the bottom half the screen because each row is separated by walls that are much too tall. Good luck to anyone who wants a mediocre experience with overly high prices. Never to return!"}
{"text":"Their 21+ \"Cinema Suites\" theaters with Lazy-boy style seats are the most wonderful way to see a movie.  Make sure you buy your tickets ahead of time as the seats are reserved.    On the other hand, I've been in their 18-and-up \"Fork & Screen\" style theater once ... and haven't bothered with it since.  If you want to bring your kids here, this is the theater style you'll have to go to, but personally I thought the seats were uncomfortable (the seats in any standard, non-fancy-pants theater are far better).  Trust me, if you're not in the Cinema Suites theater, just go to a regular theater instead."}
{"text":"This place is great! Make sure to reserve your seats before stopping in! As soon as you enter you'll see a nice bar. Servers are friendly. The seats are nice but don't recline. Wouldn't recommend the food here, stick with the popcorn or nachos!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place! I'm afraid I have gone for the last time.  I enjoy the comfortable seats but service will be keeping me away.   I have had cold popcorn delivered to me, and red wine when I ordered white. One time I ordered a bottle of wine and received an open bottle with wine missing. Bartenders are overwhelmed easily and the bar is often filthy when any guests are present. The quality of food isn't worthy of the experience.   I don't expect much from this place anymore which is sad. They have so much potential if they would take their service seriously."}
{"text":"The AMC Esplanade is an enjoyable experience when watching a movie. This is the only theater I will go to, specifically, because you can pick your own seat, ordering tickets online and even food. The staff are quick with orders and always helpful. Further, I saw complaints about the elevator and escalator; however, I don't believe that is AMC's fault for them being down. With the competition between movie theaters, I doubt AMC wants those facilities to be down.  Love AMC Theaters and this place especially!"}
{"text":"Great way to see a movie.   Pros: Comfortable, assigned seating (buy online in advance) ensures you don't have to rush or wait in line.   Lobby bar is a great place to meet for a drink or three before the movie.  Cons: Cocktails seem a bit watered-down on multiple visits. Count on spending at least $50/person if you're talking dinner/movie/drink."}
{"text":"Was served two flat beers, the pizza for my two year old came out cold, along with cold stiff fries.  The salads were fine, the shrimp I served was good.  The service they do have down, the wait staff was gracious and did the best they could.  The back kitchen needs SERIOUS work... SERIOUS work.  I will wait for a long time before I go back again."}
{"text":"This AMC has gone way down hill for the area it exists in. Have gone there twice in last two month. Once the will call buttons didn't work so it was impossible to get service. The second time their ovens weren't working so majority of menu wasn't available.  Save your time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and another couple to watch Star Wars on New Years Eve. We were going to eat dinner here and have some drinks, but after the iffy Yelp reviews, we went to a real restaurant instead. Glad we did - because after we took our seats, I ordered popcorn well before the start of the movie. It took 20 minutes to arrive; and it was cold, and way over-salted. I paid the tab at the end of the movie - over $8.00 for the bucket, and handed the waitress a $20 bill. Rather than making change on the spot, we all had to wait at least 10 minutes for her to come back. Altogether, the waitresses walking around the place during the movie was distracting; the seats, as others have commented, were not very comfortable; and if they can't get popcorn right, I can't see trusting them with anything more complex- like a burger. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This was our first time. The food was good but the service was horrible. Our server was Imran. He made it a horrible experience. We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Average. I am spoiled by seats that adjust to the point where I'm almost in bed. :).  Food was average. Couldn't see it so that was scary yet it may have helped."}
{"text":"I love this theatre because it is for adults only. This makes a simple date night into more of pleasant experience because their are NO babies, young kids, crying or screaming!  Man....and they sell angry orchard!  Gluten free alcohol sipping boy I was.   I will say if you can avoid the spoon and fork theatre.  The better one is the other theatre because the chairs are bigger and they recline without touching the person behind or in front of you.    Happy viewing!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this theatre. Now they changed their dinner menu to something you could find at a dive bar. Way overpriced for mediocre at best food. Absolutely terrible. Changed review to a 1 star after sitting thru an entire moving with what sounded like a vaccum going off every 2 mins during the whole 2hr movie. Asked the waiter the theatre is claiming \"wind\" what a joke. We were in theatre 7 right near the kitchen. Don't plan on heading back to this location."}
{"text":"This was the best theater I have been to in the Valley that serves food & drinks in the movie. Great lobby, statium seating, clean and friendly service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place! I've been going here for years I take my fiancé, and when all my other family visits I take them here. I recently moved away from the area but I enjoy going here so much I do not mind the extra distance. The food and drinks are really good as well. If there was one improvement that I may recommend it would be faster service. Sometimes it drags out a bit--again just a recommendation not a complaint. Love it overall and I remain loyal!"}
{"text":"Tried this theater because it offered food.   First one of the escalators is broken but you can take the elevator. By the way, not that it's the theater's fault but the drivers in the parking g structure are very reckless so be cautious.   Anyway, the theater is what you'd expect for AMC. The theaters are small with nice sized seats. These do not recline all the way, no foot rests and don't have heaters. The backs will recline slightly and the seats are cushy but they aren't comfortable for someone as small as I am. We noticed some seats worn and torn. The table is ample sized with back-stops to prevent things from sliding off.   As for the food, it's good. Not spectacular just good. Had the jalapeño burger, it was tasty. It didn't have any heat to it but it was satisfying. The burger and fries were fresh and hot. My husband had an appetizer platter and he enjoyed his food.   Now it was the service that really disappoints. We were among the first to order, having arrived about 15 minutes early. It took them about 10 minutes to even respond.   One in our party got their food and drink within 15 minutes. The remaining three of us didn't get our food until 45 minutes into the movie. I didn't get my cocktail until shortly after. We complained to the manager and he told us our order only took 16 minutes.  Rather than argue in the middle of the movie, we just went with it. The food runners seemed extremely confused. Throughout the first hour you can see him asking around whose order was whose. Distracting.   We won't return to this AMC because it's out of our way and the food and service wouldn't make the trip worth it. Well, if it was only 10 minutes away I'm still not sure we'd go back because of the poor service."}
{"text":"I love this theater.  First, let me just say, the 21+ theater - BRILLIANT.  I love that I can go to the movies, sit in a recliner, order booze and food delivered directly to me, AND I don't have to deal with screaming children????  (Don't worry - those of you with children they separate the theater into two sides, one for all ages and one for 21+.)  The food is good, not great, but definitely good.  If the food quality was just a bit better I would have rated this place 5 stars.  The set up is fantastic, I can actually see the screen from any seat no matter who sits in front of me and my husband (who is 6'1\") no longer has to slouch in his seat out of fear he is blocking the person behind him.  My suggestion, buy the $12 stubs rewards card.  It's worth it.  You avoid the internet ticket purchasing fees, plus earn rewards towards free credits."}
{"text":"Awesome experience overall.  The seats are as comfy as can be.  The food is very good bit a bit pricy.   But that's why I don't go every weekend.  The employees are very friendly but occasionally they forget to bring something when you ask for it.  The service is still fast though."}
{"text":"I have been here before and love the concept. I went out with my mom on Saturday and told her how great this theater was.  Boy did I look like a schmo. We usually go to Arrowhead. Should have stuck with that location. The online ticket portal specifically said \"reclining seats.\" Imagine my surprise when I got basically a coach airplane seat. The seat \"rocked\" back and forth but in no way did it recline. I inquired with our server about this and it was obvious that I was not the only one who was victim to AMC's bait and switch. He said only the first 5 theaters have recliners and ther is NO WAY to know what theater you are booking online. Um hello....am I no longer in 2017? What am I supposed to do, go down there 4 days in advance an inquire. Absolutely unacceptable.  On a happy note, our server was great, food was ok and my mom and I had a good time. But I am just not ok with this flat out false advertising by AMC."}
{"text":"Bought two seats and the one my husband sat in made a squeaky sound every time he moved! He had to sit still throughout movie. Not worth a second visit from me."}
{"text":"Honestly, this AMC was a pretty big let down. It's not at all clear from the area how to even find the movie theater; from our spot in the parking garage, we probably wandered around the Esplanade for 10 minutes before we found stairs leading to the theater. Upon walking inside, there is no immediately clear direction as to what you're supposed to do; we bought our tickets online, so we assumed that we had to check in or get printed tickets somewhere. Nope, apparently not. The only counter in the front lobby is for something called premiere guests. We actually didn't ever have our tickets checked once... So, good thing we're not terrible people and didn't lie about where we were supposed to be, I guess?   We were killing some time before our movie started, so we headed to the bar to check out our food and drink options before we went to sit down in our auditorium. We were there for a while before a bartender addressed us, and when we asked to see a food menu along with the drinks, he seemed a little taken aback and had to call on another employee for help. The other employee scampered off and returned a few minutes later with a food menu. Not a big deal, but a little confusing as to why they don't have those on hand.   We went to our auditorium, and pushed the call button upon making our food/drink decisions. Now granted, we were sitting in the back row. But, it was probably a full 40 minutes between the time we pushed the call button and when an employee actually arrived to take our order. It seemed that there was only one server working our entire auditorium, so she started with the front row and wound her way back to us. We felt really bad for her, as she was clearly flustered and overwhelmed. When we asked about their gluten free options, she said she'd return with a list of which menu items were gluten free--no dice, she said it \"wasn't where it's normally kept\" so we kind of just had to gamble on it. Our food came out probably half an hour later, which was more or less expected, but we didn't get water until probably a full hour into the actual movie itself (which, for the record, started about 40 minutes after the posted time).   The whole shebang just seemed super unorganized, and was an unnecessarily stressful movie-going experience. Our checks weren't brought out until the movie had fully ended, and the party next to us actually just walked out without paying; I can't speak to whether or not they meant to, or just genuinely forgot that they hadn't yet paid, but it was kind of a bummer for the already-stressed server who was clearly overworked and definitely should've had some help.   The one upside? Super comfy recliners. Unfortunately, we weren't able to make full use of them, as there is a little wall between your seat and the row in front of you. Even sitting up fully, I probably couldn't see the bottom two feet of the screen. When I was fully reclined, I was missing about the bottom 50% of the movie. Cool.  Definitely will be sticking with Roadhouse in the future."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was senior day here but they were everywhere on Sunday. They were in the way and very mean. If they do have senior day here I highly recommend not coming on that day.   Having just gone to the movies 3 days prior and having such a wonderful experience at the other theater, this theater did not meet those expectations.   I liked how big and clean it is in here and the air conditioning was at just the right setting.   The concession stand line was confusing. With elderly wondering around it made it even more confusing.   I got Popcorn, A Coke Zero (YAY!!!) and a Soft Pretzel with no salt.   You had to put your own butter on your popcorn. How am I supposed to get the layered effect if I'm handed a full bag of popcorn? This is a luxury that I will never take for granted again.   Also the butter had a bad aftertaste that I didn't like.   There is also nothing to put the mustard in for your pretzel. I had to wade back through Bermuda shorts, beige socks pulled up the calf, canes and blue hairs to the concession stand to get a small cup to put mustard in for dipping.   I will say the pretzel was pretty darn good and chewy and moist.   The seats were uncomfortable. They did have those lifting arms which is nice to spread out.   Its OK, not to busy except for the schoals of old people wondering around. Its just OK in my book"}
{"text":"I would usually give this place 4-5 stars. My fiancé and I see a movie here about once a week. Today we saw the Purge Anarchy. We didn't receive water until 30 minutes into the movie! THEN we had the service light on for another 20 minutes to get our water refilled and get silverware before the waitress ever came over. THEN, when the waitress came to give us silverware (all that was left at our seats were the dirty fork and napkins from the people who sat there before us) she kept forgetting my water! I even reminded her AGAIN when the check came. I never once received a refill on water in AZ when it was 111 degrees outside!! The waitress was named Jocelyne. We left a $1 tip for a $26 meal...I thought I was being too nice."}
{"text":"The over-sized, electronic reclining seats are worth the price of admission alone. No kids is a big plus. The food hits the spot and the serving sizes are good, no skimping. Makes for a nice date night. The seats are a little far apart so you'll have to make due with making out in the parking lot."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the bar/snack register does not have the candy readily available or on display. The bartender had to leave her station to walk halfway across the theater to get our order making us late for the movie. Then it was quite warm inside the theater, enough to make me uncomfortable throughout the movie."}
{"text":"We would never go back.  $17.50 per ticket with these big comfortable seats, and a pony wall in front of you that blocks about 2 feet of the lower screen.  Thanks but no thanks.  We used to come there often but when they made the change to the intimate theaters, we are passing!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I go to watch movies now.... They have a full bar, the food menu is extensive for a movie theater. Drinks are pretty good and you even get a glow stick in some of the specialty cocktails. Servers have always been helpful without being pushy. Appetizer sampler is a good starter... Don't forget you can also get candy and popcorn like a regular movie concession. BTW the order of regular popcorn is HUGE-GANTIC!!! Parmesan Fries are also good and the portion is huge! Don't forget the full bar!! You can meet up before the movies and get a little toasted! Hahaha  Try to get a theater that has the touch button recliners. They are so comfortable... It makes it feel like you're watching a movie in bed. Don't forget to validate your parking."}
{"text":"According to Yelp, I've checked in here 27 times.  Yesterday just might be my last.  As I've stated in previous reviews, we pretty much only come to Esplanade which is about a 40 minute drive from my house.    Despite a few bad experiences, we've patronized the Esplanade theater since it opened.  We used to love to go there for dinner and drinks while enjoying a movie.  The food went downhill so we started skipping meals there and eating elsewhere before or after.  The drinks were never terribly good (way too sweet and stingy pours) so we started going elsewhere for that too.  (Beer and cider are safe but the cider never changes.)    Yesterday, we arrived at our Cinema Suites theater to find our seats and seating area filthy.  There was popcorn in the cupholders.  The table area between the sets of two was full of crumbs.  The floor appeared to be dirty as well - I kept my purse in my lap during the movie.  I was tempted to contact a manager right then but the movie was starting and I didn't want to miss it.    I also requested water and never got it.   Additionally, two of our three purchased seats had tears and were taped over.  The theater is showing obvious signs of wear and tear which really detracts from the \"luxury experience\" of having recliners and no children.    I did speak with a manager after the show and he seemed very disinterested.  I explained that I was a long time customer and explained the issues.  He clarified which theater it was and said he would have someone take a look at it.  No apology.  No contriteness.  Nothing.   Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed in our experience and even more so at the lack of interest from the manager.  Everybody can have a bad day and maybe someone missed cleaning that theater... that's where the manager comes in.  An apology and a remote interest in keeping a customer would have gone a long way."}
{"text":"My husband and I  went there on Friday the 12th. We were both disappointed with our movie going experience. First, the popcorn tasted like it had been sitting out for days, it wasn't fresh, and it was tasted burnt. We figured that if they could not do popcorn right, why would we order any food? We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to come watch a movie. The only place we come to, but since the menu change we have started to eat before the movie. Which cuts down a lot of revenue for the theater. We used to leave with at least a $70-$100. The traditional wings here used to be amazing, now it feels as if it's chicken nuggets. There's no more dynamite chicken. The Loaded Tots are good and the Brussel sprouts but the Mac and cheese are all good but over reaching. I had the Grill Chicken quinoa and I didn't enjoy it, it came out cold.   So the place is good but it used to be great and it felt like it got boring. Lacked inspiration. The boneless chicken wings and the southern chicken tenders are the same. Drinks are still good, but since I eat now before I come it's not fun to order a drink. I'm looking forward to a revamp again. This place could be amazing. I used to talk about how great the chefs choices and how the cooks were, now it's blah."}
{"text":"I love the concept and the seating is amazing but the operations side needs help.  I arrived 30 minutes before show time when I was supposed to be seated. I had to stand outside the theater for an additional 20 minutes while they supposedly cleaned. Only one or two people went in or out of the theater and then we were able to enter.  We didn't have time to order our meal and get settled before the previews started."}
{"text":"This AMC is located in the Biltmore area near the Ritz-Carlton and has a parking garage behind it which did not have a fee. The area in which this AMC is in has a lot of shops and the corridors are architecturally detailed.   The service was great from entrance to exit especially the waiters during the movie. They came in about twice during the movie even though we didn't ring (press a button for service). The menu is pretty large. Most of the food is of the \"American\" variety. The desserts were tempting but overall it was a bit pricey for the type of food offered and serving portions.   The best part of this theater has to be the giant cherry red recliners. The most comfortable movie theater seats I have ever enjoyed a movie in.   The screen and movie display was relatively the same as any AMC, nothing special there.  Oh and this theater has a full bar instead of a candy case in the lobby. That has to be an incentive for some people. Candy and popcorn can be found on the menu received when seated for your movie, don't worry."}
{"text":"It's run down, the service wasn't great. Parking was confusing. Waited a really long time for our food. No refills offered on our drinks. My seat was broken and clicking everytime i moved. Gave it two stars because I enjoyed the movie itself."}
{"text":"My first time here and definitely going back! You can drink adult beverages and eat while watching a movie!! Food is actually good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"First time and will not go back....   maybe I will. Seats are bigger and spacious but not comfortable. I felt like I was going to slide off. My husband purchesed middle seats which is normally eye level to the screen not here you will be looking down to the screen. Which is not bad but your seat is shaped to your back and your head sits on the chair facing upward. It smelled like onions right from the start.  I did not have dinner just soda, popcorn and candy way over priced. My husband loved the fact that he could drink his beer and enjoy the movie. He and my son ordered the special nachos. They were not good but looked delicious. Well what can I say, I sleep like baby but they did not have a good night."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a premier movie-watching experience, this place is for you. Plush leather chairs that fully recline AND drink/meal service throughout the screening? Dayummm. Can't go wrong. We even ordered off the menu items and were fully accommodated."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have ever watched movies at. Not only can I go to the matinees I can share it with friends a wonderful time of lunch and a good movie and a totally comfortable environment. Services are phenomenal you were treated with total respect and as if you were the only person in the entire theater while you're watching your movie. I travel almost 40 miles one way just to go to this specific Theater. Have never had a bad experience and take all my out-of-town guests today's special place."}
{"text":"It would be cool if the waiters menu tablets signalized with the call buttons, creates a bit of lag waiting for them if they're not around or see your light right away. Otherwise convenient, comfortable and decent menu. Mac and cheese, chicken tenders, etc., and bottomless popcorn!"}
{"text":"This is a good theatre. Tickets are $5.00 in the morning, the seats are comfortable and the service is friendly. Plus, how many places can you pay $5.00 to see a show and then share a bottle of prosecco? Plus, the prosecco was a decent bottle.   If you are going here to eat really amazing good, you may be disappointed. This eat-in theatre is good for the classic popcorn, candy, nachos and does have a couple of decent appetizers such as the pretzel bites, I recommend shying away from the sushi and seafood choices."}
{"text":"Here's a huge upside of the AMC dine in theater, you get to reserve and pick your own seats. Wait staff take your order for various movie treats along with a Full dining and drink menu including alcoholic beverages. The theater is nice and clean and I like that the theater seems to be making an effort to go green by using reusable dishes and flatware versus disposable. There is also covered parking which is really nice especially in the heat of the summer. Remember to get your parking ticket validated. The one down the side is that it is very expensive if you decide to order food and drinks."}
{"text":"Regular movie theaters have been ruined for me. Esplanade is fantastic and while it's a bit of a drive for us, it is a a theater  I will gladly put miles on my car for. Between the two types of theaters, I would recommend the Cinema Suites. These theaters are smaller (less people to annoy you,) no kids allowed,  the cushy seats recline, no one can kick your chair (you're in your own partitioned row,) and best of all you have your very own server in your very own reserved seat.  It's in a great part of Phoenix, the Biltmore area has plenty of options should you choose to have dinner outside of the the theater. Make sure if you park in the garage you have the front desk validate your ticket. Also, reserve tickets online before you head out the door. The theaters are small and sell out very quickly. Looking forward to seeing The Dark Knight Rises midnight premier this week and NOT have to wait in line! God bless reserved seating."}
{"text":"Definitely not your average theater and it doesn't have to be expensive if you can figure out when the cheap shows are.  Too bad the website is confusing and it's hard to figure out. I ended up just hovering over the times and saw different prices ranging from $6.75 - $17. Guess it doesn't matter if you've got the cash flow but I'm a student and would save this place for a special night out.  Harkins student tix are always $7. Free 4 hour parking with validation.  The theater is very clean and there are large screens, even in the small auditoriums.  The seats are pretty comfortable but are arranged in sets of two. Every 3rd person will feel a bit away from your group because the extra armrest/service-tray thing.  It's a good concept to have food but I found the smell of others eating to be annoying when I wasn't hungry.  The light next to each seat bothered me a lot and I used a menu to cover it up.  Servers coming in and out of the room during the movie was also disruptive for me, especially when they made wrong deliveries and had to find out who ordered what. And there were definitely kids running around the lobby. Kids aren't not allowed; they just need to be with an adult.    If you wan't dinner and a movie, go out somewhere where you can actually see your date and have a conversation. I'll probably be back for the cheapest shows because I like clean theaters... but I don't think it's worth paying extra for."}
{"text":"Dine in theater which is a plus for those wanting to have dinner and a movie. Cheap pricing considering we got to reserve our seats. Comfortable seats, only complaint is they were at a weird angle, but you get used to it. Parking was a little bit of a mission -- lots of garages around, but it was hard to figure out which one the movie theater was for. Once we found it, we had to climb three flights of stairs to get to the front of the theater. On the plus, parking is validated for up to 4 hours!"}
{"text":"Sat in the second row from the top, and from there we couldn't see the bottom third of the screen while reclining, and couldn't see the bottom quarter while sitting upright due to the wall that divides the rows (I'm 6' 0\")  Wait service was good and discreet while the movie was playing.  Prices are comparable to a Diamondbacks or Suns game as far as food and drink.  Theater was clean; the restroom could have used some work."}
{"text":"As I mentioned in my check in... 3 hours still no nachos. Got to the theatre, checked out the menu and the best option for us was to get a couple of snacks, turns out it was the biggest mistake in AMC history. The wings were good but they were the only food we got that we ordered. Ordered the loaded nachos but they probably couldn't carry them out of the kitchen because I never got them. #thatswhatyoucallloaded. Went to customer service to ask about my nachos and they said they were going to send out a manager, three hours later I'm still sitting here waiting for said manager. How much longer should I wait?  In all honesty, horrible customer service, you should spend your money on Harkins"}
{"text":"Parking is horrible  . The place is very busy. . But it is an experience  to be there. The sound system  is great and seats very comfortable.  Just a challenge"}
{"text":"Worst food ever. I mean I wasn't expecting like high quality but come on. The mac and cheese I ordered was dry and cold. No cheese whatever. The bacon that was suppose to come in it but just pieces of bacon stuck together by grease."}
{"text":"My wife and I heard about this new cinemasuites thing at a christmas party. So we decided to go check it out. It was totally worth the drive to get there. All guests at the cinemasuites have to be over 21yrs old. The seats are all leather lazy boys with electronic recliners. You have a button to push for service, and there are drink menus and food. Its like being first class on an airplane only better! Movies before Noon are 9$ and movies after noon are 12$. Not too bad for such an experience!!"}
{"text":"I am a major movie fan! I have been to this theater a number of times.  Last night 5 servers standing at the front of the theater bitching about their schedules.  At the end of the movie I'm told to hurry and leave and be sure to tell my friends no after credits so they can clean sooner.  This morning first in and my server didn't show up for almost 25 minutes 10 couples served before I get my food.  Fries cold and burger not prepared correctly.   Spoke with mgmt and I hear the service person complaining about her sciatic nerve."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge movie theater person, preferring to spend my free time outside. However, when a friend suggested we have a girls' night and take in a movie at the Dine-in theater, I thought, \"why not?\" The AMC Dine-in theatre is a pretty luxurious experience; from the seat-side service and multiple food and drink options to the huge, cushy seats, all was an enjoyable experience. Prices are on the high side (theatre prices!). I got one veggie sushi roll ($10 for 8 pieces, 670 calories -- one of the items lowest in calories!) and a glass of white wine (I think it was about $10) while my friend ordered the classic burger and fries ($12, 1330 calories for the burger; 850 calories for the fries) and a glass of red wine. You order your food and drink whilst lounging in your chair...then staff come by and deliver your order. A person can get used to that!  A couple of things: 1) Don't go to the dine-in theatre if you are counting calories and trying to save money. You can easily spend $40 per person from the movie ticket, food, and drink. 2) That said, if you want to try and make healthy dining choices, at least you have calorie info!  This won't be a regular place to visit, but if I want to splurge and indulge, I know where to go!"}
{"text":"Now this must be how movie heaven feels like. As a pauper =( having the opportunity to enjoy the experience a couple times a year does it for me. It's first class seats and service for a mere $15 for a movie ticket, then add on drinks and an appetizer, and you end up spending close to $40. Not bad, especially if it's a real big blockbuster movie, then it makes it more worth it. check it out, it's awesome."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  I was in town for business trip and had a free afternoon. Decided to take the bus down to the AMC. My only complaint, ONLY. No sign to advertise this theater from the ground floor. Me, like an idiot walked around the entire building not knowing the theater was on the third floor of the building. For a non-local it was hard to find.  Once I got upstairs, I found they dont have box offices. Just kiosks to buy tickets. Very self explanatory. Easy. Once I purchased my ticket, an really nice guy directed me to my theater. Made chit chat about where I was from. Great service. In the lobby is a gigantic bar. Filled with booze and beer. I'm from Vegas, I like this bar! It felt like home :)  I asked the guy where I can get popcorn and a drink. He said you just go in the theater and a waiter will serve you drinks and popcorn. What! 'Thats $&^%^ Awesome!' He replied that it is very awesome.  The theater is huge. Very big. it was 4 in the afternoon so nobody was in the theater besides two other people. I ordered wings and a coke zero. Fast service, even got a free refill. Movie sound was great, huge screen. Little chilly in the theater, which is the way it should be :) I'll be back ! Suggesting it to all my traveling friends. Customer for Life !"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice and I have no real desire to go back. I give it two stars instead of just one because the beer I ordered was very cold, which I enjoyed. Otherwise this theater wasn't too pleasant. My friend and I went to see Rogue One recently, and like others have complained it took forever to get our food. And speaking of food, we probably heard about 7 or 8 pieces of silverware hit the ground during the movie. Lol. The seat I was sitting in had duct tape on the arm rest. I had seen the same red duct tape on another armrest in a recliner theater here during a previous visit. The seats behind us were too close and the children sitting behind us kept kicking the seat (I thought this theater didn't let anyone under 18 in. Has that changed?)   The servers are super nice and are trying their best! Don't give them a hard time, these issues should reflect poorly on management and not the staff.   If you're looking for a better luxury movie going experience I suggest trying out Harkins at Scottsdale Fashion Square."}
{"text":"I've been to this theater several times. It is a bit pricey compared to most. I invited a friend to this facility. And OMG! he is still complaining about the admission. That was my fault. I should have given him a heads up.   I like the place. You can choose your seating when you purchase your ticket(s). The seating is VERY comfortable...oversized, recycling seats! Don't sit on the very back row...you won't get the full effects of the these seats.  Staff come around before the start of the show to take your food and beverage order. However, you can purchased a beverage and/or eat prior to entering the theater. The staff has always been pleasant and knowledgeable of the menu items as well as the what's currently playing.  There is plenty of garage parking. Staff will validate your ticket."}
{"text":"The only way to watch a movie, this is the best movie theater in Phoenix, little costly but worth it for watching a movie while seating in a reclining lazy-boy and a full bar and the food is pretty good.."}
{"text":"Since the menu change....yes a few vegetarian options...but the kids menu options are crap and half the size and quality they used to be.  My sons chicken strips were cold and stale...wow what a disappointment.  The prices are insane for shitty food as well.  We will not be eating here ever again!  The Biltmore mall restaurants are a short stroll away....and well worth the price over this place.  If the theater is losing money, jacking up the prices on horrible food isn't gonna buy them much time."}
{"text":"MoviePass works at AMC in Biltmore!!!!!!   Wow, this is another game changer for MoviePass and the film industry.  I like AMC but it could get a little pricy with everything so I feel much better going since my ticket is \"free\".  The ticket process was smooth and no issues to boot."}
{"text":"Kinda hard to find for people new to Phoenix. Escalators were not working and no signs directing you to the elevators or stairs. Nice area for grown ups who want to drink and get nice VIP treatment. Reclining chairs laid all the way down, they were so comfy I could almost fall sleep in them if it wasn't for the movie lol. Service was fast and friendly.  Although we were bummed they didn't offer regular nachos with cheese. Everything was served on a nice silver player..fancy! Very pricey but worth the theater experience. No complaints! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"AMC refused to serve my 84-year-old grandmother a drink on her birthday because she left her ID in the car. Not kidding.  The manager of this theatre is on a pathetic, little power trip. He went above and beyond to be condescending during the whole ordeal, making sure that we knew if anyone else bought my elderly grandmother a vodka it would be confiscated. He said this even after we said we'd go to the car to get her ID. He wouldn't even allow the drink to get started while the ID was being retrieved from the parking garage. I mean, jesus christ. I wanted to freak out on this guy, but decided against it. His life, as a movie theatre manager, is thankless enough.   P.S. Congrats on being condescending towards an old lady whose only pleasure in life at the moment is vodka. Did I mention her husband recently passed away? Way to ruin the only movie she's been to in over a decade, jerk.  P.S.S. As it turned out, this also ended up being the last movie she ever went to and the last birthday she ever celebrated ... so good job manager-douche. The next time an 80-something year old person wants an adult beverage, just give it to them."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for while, but never tried out AMC Esplanade until a few weeks ago.  We'd always go to Harkins or Studio Movie Grill out of habit.  And while I really like the quality of the theater and the location, the food leaves much to be desired.  First off, I love being able to pick my seats online ahead of time.  We use the AMC app to book our tickets, which also allows us to get points through their AMC Stubs rewards program.  The seats themselves are great - plush leather reclining seats.  Super comfy for watching a movie.  And the theaters only hold maybe 40 people max, so it feels much more like a private theater.  The food is really the only thing I don't like.  We've tried the appetizer sampler, the burger, and the chicken tenders.  All were really greasy and poor quality for what you pay for.  I'd almost prefer regular movie theater conessions to this.  I did try the quinoa bowl which is the only item on the menu I've enjoyed there.  Great for a matinee, but if you want a full service movie theater I'd recommend studio movie grill or iPic."}
{"text":"Firstly I want to say that service here was just phenomenal! Alexander served us tonight while we watched captain America and we had a good time. Do expect a large amount of white noise from all the other patrons eating. The servers walk around and deliver food and it all provides for a rather distracting experience. I'm not sure I would go for a movie that I really want to enjoy, but if you're here to drink beer and watch The Expendables, than you are in the right place!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here to watch movies. Being able to pick my seat ahead of time and have a cocktail while watching a movie is awesome! The icing on the cake is the 21 and up cinema suites.  The food isn't bad but I normally eat elsewhere before heading here. If you're drinking, go for beer or cocktails, the wine is typically warm and a little overpriced. The beer gets you the most bang for your buck especially if you get a pitcher."}
{"text":"Came to Amc to see Sully and the projector doesn't work for a straight 15 minutes! They came in and told us that it was fixed but it has still been 5 minutes since playing AND skipped previews because of a majority vote... Wtffffff. Movie was supposed to start at 1045 and didn't start until well after 11pm. We asked for popcorn after we got our drinks but it never came until we pressed our res assist button. Movie was good, seats didn't recline all the way. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i went out for a date night and decided to try something new with the dine in theatre. we saw \"daddy's home\" which was hilarious and a great choice for the first time dine in experience. we ordered the chicken quesadilla and the the buffalo hot wing plate. the food was quite good for a theatre and the service was amazing. the waiters were quiet and tried their best not to disrupt the show which was really nice. we ended the movie with a delicious chocolate milkshake which was woah to die for! over all our experience was great! the movie was funny, the food was tasty, and the service was top notch. not an all the time date night because it is pricey, however it is a once in awhile experience we would do again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This is the closest theater to my house - and I am digging matinee pricing. I work second shift, so the lunchtime showing of movie plus lunch at the same time makes weekday movies a possibility for me.  Is the food fantastic?  Not really.  But it's predictable and tasty - the servers I have dealt with are all friendly and well trained not to impede with the movie.  Glad it's here - and as long as the quality and cleanliness keeps up, I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience. Not all theaters here have reclining seats, so I made sure to pick the showing that does have them. I had two pair martinis. They were delicious. Service was great. I ordered the shrimp flat bread and the Parmesan fry's. It was great for movie theater food. The parking is always free. Just get your ticket validated inside AMC. There is an escalator past the elevator if you actually look."}
{"text":"Make sure you double check your bill. Two people in our party had incorrect bills. Great concept but a redbox and a Papa Murphy's pizza is about $80 cheaper."}
{"text":"Okay, it's gone downhill a little bit...  First issue is the menu changed, and the food selection and quality have definitely gone down, while the prices went up.  Beyond this, is the fact that on opening week for a blockbuster movie, they only have 1 or two cinema suites showings a week... Frankly, the Fork and Screen showings aren't worth it.  This has now happened for Star Wars and for Deadpool.  Not to mention that back in August (Phoenix is freakishly hot), was stuck in the elevator for nearly an hour (about 140 degrees in there).  The service the past few times I've went was pretty bad.  AMC really needs to pull their heads out of their asses and actually have more cinema suites showings of top selling movies... They are consistently sold out, except for the handicap spaces that don't actually have seats, and no indication on the website as such.  Beyond this, every time you have to go back on their website to pick another time, it takes forever for the current day to load before you can change days, then it takes a long time again... it's like the programmers at AMC never heard of data caching."}
{"text":"Always use to get a wonderful shake with the movie it was expensive but worth it. Now they are horrible, filled with ice. Way too much money for a ice filled shake. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"The new design and layout of the theater is great, but what makes this my new favorite place to catch a movie would have to be the seat side service and the pretty good bar food selection they have."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP I LOVE THIS PLACE.  the chairs are awesome and the servers are great."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Hate waiting in line for a movie hate having to look for a good seat because they are always taken... But this place.. I love how it os just s few seats so you don't have to worry about other being too loud or having to worry about where to sit. Just buy your tickets online and you get to pick where you sit and the best part bout it is that they are reserved! I love going to the 21 and over, their seats are so comfy and so huge you can literally lay on the couch! It's like being at home and having s waiter! YES!!!"}
{"text":"went there last night with my parents and boyfriend to see Jurassic World.  Movie was awesome!!! :)  Theater was nice and clean...but we had to pre buy our tickets a couple days before, and the only four seats we could get together were in the last row.  Last row was fine, not too far away seeing how there is only like 6 rows total, but DO NOT sit up there if you're under 6 feet tall.  You can not see the bottom of the screen because of the wall in front of you, therefore you cannot use your big comfy recliner at all!!!  :( so i was pretty much sitting on my legs to use as a booster seat so i could see the whole screen.  Note to self, i will never sit in the last row again.  As for the food, it was good...service was a little slow.  i had my button pressed for a good 15 mins, server never came, so i had my bf press his also, and finally ten mins later the server came.  so movie and food and theater was good.....seats were horrible and service was not so good."}
{"text":"Great movie! Awful service. I order one mixed drink from their menu at the beginning of the movie and 1.5 hours later after asking for the drink twice still nothing. I went down to the bar to get my own drink and my order was just sitting by the bar! The novel was great but I would not recommend visiting this theater ever."}
{"text":"We basically only go to this theater because it is the closest around and we can reserve seats. It's overpriced because it is a \"dine-in\" theater, but the food is pretty bad. There is nothing light on the menu. Also they have enough early showings, they really should add some brunch items. The thing that bugs me the most is that they only have one size for popcorn: massive. Would it kill them to add a medium?  Also most of their theaters do not have reclining seats and the tables are not set up well if you want to share food with your date."}
{"text":"this is by far my favorite theater.  Just to give you an idea, i have two theaters near me (one run by teenagers and the other by people who use the theater as a baby sitter).   So i have no problems driving way out of may way to experience a movie without those distractions.  21+ screenings is the best service idea that has come to the theater industry.  The reclining chairs also are an added plus  the downfall to the theater is the service.  While most of my experiences have been great sometimes they are slow to take your order, other times the food takes forever and the worst is they forget something like your beverage.  I understand that depending on when I placed my order the kitchen could be slammed so i try not to hold that against them.  Despite the sometimes slow service the staff has always been friendly.  Food quality - well for the price you would expect better but i guess you are paying for convenience.  It's not that the food is bad, it just needs a tweek to give it a boost in flavor.  I just wish they had more 21+ showings throughout the week."}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit this theater last week as well as yesterday for free screenings of the new \"dine and movie\" concept. I watched 4 movies- 2 of which were cinema suites (way better) and 2 Fork and screen. Cinema suites is pretty killer. No IPIC but hey you get what you pay for. The seats reclined all the way back they are big leather comfy seats. The menu was very chain-like. I ordered Thai coconut chix tenders that came with fries and a cpl of chili-asian like dipping sauces. Thank God it was free b/c $10 bux is kinda steep. The best meals I ordered were the smoked salmon BLT and Chicken tenders. Pass on the pizza (blech). The Fork and Screen rooms are not comparable at all to the cinema suites. They had hard leather chairs that basically swiveled a little. Go for the Cinema Suites it was roomier and really comfy. Plus you get a complimentary lil cup of the daily gourmet popcorn, hot washcloth and a ghiradelli choc mint candy when you leave."}
{"text":"I've always been a loyal AMC Esplanade customer. For the past 3-4 few years, AMC on camelback has been our go-to theater. I can't remember the last time I've been to a \"regular\" theater. Like the other reviewers have pointed out, you become spoiled after you go to a dine in. I've never been particularly a fan of their food, but it's always an enjoyable experience nonetheless.  Last night was the first time that I had a disappointing experience. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered from the Kid's menu, specifically the chicken tenders ($8). The menu had stated that it came with a drink and a fruit cup. I had asked the server for coke as my drink of choice. At the end of the movie, as I was about to sign my tab, I was surprised to find that they had charged me separately for the coke ($5). I went to the front desk area to voice my concern, and one of the staff members rudely told me that it would be a while before she can help me with my tab. She walked out and came back with who I assumed was the manager. I voiced to her my concern, telling her that I thought the kids meal came with a coke which I was charged separately for. She told me that I was not allowed to order from the kid's meal and that was the reason why I was charged. I told her that the server did not inform me that this was the case, and that had I known this I would not have ordered from the kid's menu. The manager made it seem like my fault, and was adamant that she would not take the $5 off my tab.   The manager almost made me feel like I should be thankful they \"allowed\" me to order from the kid's menu. I didn't get their logic. They charged me $8 for a kid's size portion of chicken tenders, without bringing me the fruit cup that was supposed to accompany it (which I didn't realize until the very end), and charged me $5 separately for a glass of coke.  It's disappointing - it's not about the money. It's about the principle."}
{"text":"This place is filthy.  A filthy filthy mess.   Popcorn, wrappers, crumbs, and food remnants all over the floor.    Seriously?  Clean the flocking theatre before people enter as this place hasn't been cleaned all morning.    You're not the only place in town AMC.  Harkins would NEVEr look like this. This is the ESPLANAde!"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time but moved, so this location was more inconvenient for me, so only came back occasionally. We Just moved back to the area and was excited to be back at my theatre! But instead of leaving with my group talking about the movie, we were left with sticky shoes and questioning how clean the kitchen was.   One of the first in the area, this AMC provides the \"total movie going experience\" dinner, drinks and snacks are available here and the concept works, but somehow this location stresses me out.   Carpeting needs cleaning, napkins and popcorn everywhere, dirty dishes still on the handicap table, and the floor in the theatre extremely sticky with probably weeks of spilt soda. As you arrive, usually you are served immediately so food and beverage prep can begin, but we waited, and waited, and waited. No one showed for a while so I went out to ask if we could get some service while also mentioning the state of our theatre.   After the previews started service began. No big deal. Get my soda and popcorn pretty quick, but as the movie starts, food jeeps coming. So distracting. We're into the movie by about 20 min and people are still getting their food!   Management really needs to step it up here. One lady was great though. I expressed my disappointment and concerns and she handled it beautifully. Thus is why I'm giving three stars instead of one."}
{"text":"This place has a great bar area and is in a good location. But they don't have reclining seats like most places these days... kinda weird that everything else is so updated?"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Pretty good food and drinks. Has stock bar too for those that like afternoon drinks. Seating with lounge as well."}
{"text":"Writing an updated review about 4 years since the theatre opened (felt like yesterday!)  Unfortunately, it has gone a little downhill IMHO in regards to how staff is managed, the new menu items and how they're prepped.   Food/Drink  They actually had great menu items in the past with the beer battered chicken tenders/fish sticks and parmasean fries which now have a different texture/taste in the way they're prepped. Or perhaps they are doing business with a different food vendor. Either way, it's not as good as it used to be. I haven't gotten the chance to try their new burgers, but i'll be back another time to try it eventually.   Their beers and cocktail choices have remained the same I believe. I mean, it's drinks. The taste of vodka, tequila, sam adams and what not are always going to be there. Of course, all objective if the tap co2 remains consistent! But great beer selections either way. I also like the 16-20 oz options too.   Service:  It's average. Ultimately, all I care about is that you're efficient in when you respond to the button (unless its a busy weekend, i understand) and if you get me the right items. I don't need you to give me WOW! but just prompt timely service. Unfortunately, even during the weeknights i'm there, that is not always the case. 10-15 minutes for a bar napkin ? cmon!  But the whole coming in during previews or the movie doesn't bug me. What i don't understand about some of these reviews, is that people forget they're in a DINE IN THEATRE. you want snacks and drinks before the movie? go to a gas station or harkins! you don't want to be interrupted during a movie? well what the heck are you doing in the dine in theatre to begin with? that's what the concept is about. Yes, it's not always ideal to hear side conversations during the movie, but thats the sacrifice, and even then it's still worth it.  Prices:  Okay yes, it is a lot of money upfront. But it's for the luxury and convenience of being served at a movie theatre WITH reclining chairs WHILE watching a movie and being able to drink alcohol in the theatre at that. So, the prices are pretty reasonable for the experience. Plus, if you were to go to dinner prior to seeing a movie, you're still dropping a good chunk of money for the evening anyway.   Location:  It's in the heart of biltmore, with a beautiful view of the mountain when you walk out during the day or early evening. Plus, while you do wait for your movie to start, you have the luxury of hanging out by their bar or the biltmore fashion park for drinks/apps if ur not getting any of that in the theatre.   I never really have a bad experience in this movie theatre, and I will be returning back again."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this concept more, but in the end it seemed awkward and more of a hassle. Firstly, these are not reclining seats. They do lean back more than a regular seat, but recline is too much credit. When you order food the server does this before the movie and doesn't really explain the process such as how/when you pay. Food gets brought in and is handed down the line, which is weird when you are sitting next to people you don't know and you are trying to figure out who's got what when the movie is going. More distracting than anything.   The food itself was good for theater junk.  Didn't have high expectations for magically delicious gourmet, but it was decent for sure.   The theater was clean, but confusing. You can't go get your popcorn at the normal place, you have to order it from your seat. The staff was nice. It was a nice screen and the seats (while not fully reclining) were comfy. I feel like this model could be utilized more efficiently and effectively and than this dining experience would be awesome, but as is, it's just not functional."}
{"text":"The place is nice, a little messy, but it is a lot nicer than most dine in movie theaters. The food is overpriced and nothing like what is shown on the menu. Expect fast food quality food for twice the cost."}
{"text":"I love going to the movies. I think I usually go to at least one, if not two movies a week. I love the experience especially when Im at esplanade. I love knowing that my seat is reserved when I get there. The reclining chairs are also great and so relaxing to enjoy the movie. They have a popcorn for $10 but it's MASSIVE so you can easily share it with 4 or 5 people. The service is also really great there. If you want to have a relaxing movie experience, then head to AMC Esplanade."}
{"text":"By far my favorite theatre! Pricing- about $10. 00 a ticket.  Seating- assigned seating so you don't have to worry about getting to the movie theater early to find a spot for you and/or your party.  Snacks- snacks are priced normally but drinks such as Icees  and sodas have  unlimited refills via the self serve machines.  Experience- super comfy recliner seats!!! Perfect if you just want to lay back and watch your movie. Tons of leg space, it's almost impossible to kick someone's chair or have your chair kicked by the person behind you.  I would say this theatre is on par with iPic theaters minus the server, menu options, and price."}
{"text":"I'd like to congratulate the manager or whomever is doing the hiring on selecting a really solid staff.  I took my family to the theater on a busy Friday evening and we interacted with 8-10 of your people.  Each was kind ,courteous and professional.  These days that kind of service can't be taken for granted.  This continues to be my first and only choice for movies in Phoenix. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Not the best of the dining theaters - the food is average and the prices are high for both movie and food.  The portions for the mediocre food is also the smallest I've had at one of these.  The popcorn is the same price as other AMCs so that's not a relief of any sort either.  I probably won't be back to this one.."}
{"text":"What a fun way to see a movie! We enjoyed the Jambalaya and Mac and Cheese with our showing of Zoolander 2 and it was a good time. The food is fine...nothing overly special but it is a fun and different way to see a movie. It was nice to be served rather than wait like sheep at the candy counter. It was nice to have someone else cook and clean up. While it's a bit pricey, it's a creative treat for a fun evening."}
{"text":"Ok, this is a \"Fork & Screen\" and \"Cinema Suites\" AMC (one of 9 in the USA).  Since it is spanking new from the remodel completed in Sep '11, it is clean and shiny.  The comfy and roomy chairs are nice but not sure why they didn't put at least 2 to 3 more inches between them.  Service was fast at first then seemed to slow down.  If you want to drink alcohol while you watch a movie (instead of going to the AA meeting that you should be at), then this is the place.  Else, there are several other movie theaters near by that are just as comfy and a bit cheaper!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive and the seats don't recline, it felt super cramped, and our service was awful. I prefer other AMC theaters like Desert Ridge or Deer Valley. If I'm spending this kind of dough for a dine-in experience, I'd go to iPic or Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Meh. Food is just average, a lot to choose from but nothing I've ever ordered was spectacular. Best thing I've had is the Brussel Sprouts and they were out of them last time. Also out of the cheese and meat appetizer. Services is average. Drink selection is probably the biggest plus."}
{"text":"Always a good time. Hubby and I make it out here often. Comfy seats and attentive staff. Love it. Ready for Bad Moms Christmas  so ready for laugh times"}
{"text":"This is my go to theater since the remodel. I've never been much of a movie goer, not a huge fan of the whole crammed like sardines into a room with a bunch of strangers thing...AMC Esplanade is a game changer.   I'm a snob when it comes to almost everything, and hey, now I can be snobby about going to the movies too! The food is actually quite good. A significant step up from traditional bar fare. Offering everything from hot wings to fruit salad to the wonderfully tasty Smoked Salmon BLT. The fries are hot and crispy and the service is quick and friendly.  Now, let's talk liquor. When you walk in, the area that used to house popcorn, candy and soda is now a full bar! That's right, a full bar! Better wine and beer selection than I expected and you can still just get some popcorn and a Coke if you so desire.   The theaters themselves are comfortable and seating is just how I like it, recliner type seating with a lot of room between you and everyone else. We ordered our tickets online prior to the showing and were able to choose our seats which is a nice touch. Go! Go now!"}
{"text":"Best place to watch a movie!  I'm more of a rent a video at home gal than go out to the movies, but I'll make an exception for this place.  The reclining seats are fabulous.  Order the popcorn - it's seriously the biggest bowl of popcorn I've ever seen.  The only thing I didn't like was the water / soda comes in a ginormous cup with no lid."}
{"text":"Wow, did we enjoy this theater! I live only a few minutes away, and we hadn't been back since they renovated. We are so happy to see someone investing money into the Esplanade, because inept management of the complex has caused some merchants to leave or go out of business (really grungy, scary garage and elevators bothers a lot of people). But now, with AMC updated like this, there could be a resurgence coming to the Esplanade area! It is the most unique theater experience you can find anywhere. We've been to UltraStar and others who serve food and drink and this is far better. They really pulled it off.  The \"fork and screen\" theaters are less expensive and they are just like a traditional show with a somewhat nicer leather seat and a tray with a call button for service. The wait staff is friendly and outgoing (thanks Brittany!). But we enjoyed the \"CinemaSuites\" section of the theater so much more than the \"Fork and Screen\" side. In the CinemaSuites section, there are huge screens combined with exotic, electric retractable lounge chairs and dining trays that swing in and out of position. I was literally as comfortable as I would be on my own couch (more so!!) and the service was great. I had a White Chocolate Expresso Blender to drink and a delicious bacon cheeseburger. They brought us a little popcorn snack with chocolate in it that was not ordered, nor charged, and it was delicious.   The theater itself has state of the art sound and as I said, a great big screen. It was expensive ($12) but I think very much worth it. There aren't that many seats in the theater because of the amount of room they give you around each seat -- it's really super luxe. Comparing this with an airline, the seats and service are like first class here compared to the tourist/economy seating of a standard show seat like a Harkins. We get it, AMC -- we see what all the fuss is about. This is the way to see movies. The only-average movie we went to see (\"The Iron Lady\") was made so much better by the comfort and care they gave us. Highly recommended.  The only negatives we had is the continued dirty, grungy appearance of the parking area and the elevator. I agree with another poster that there's too much \"Security\" presence, but they never bothered us or made us uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I keep going back because it is close by and you can reserve seats.  But again there are so many issues with this amc.  First off amc charge convenience fees for online orders or you can avoid fees by paying a membership fee each year. Either way you pay.  Parking is ok in amc parking in rear, plan though because literally 4 hours and a couple minutes and you get nickel and dimed again (sucks for long movies). Went to theatre #7 and we didn't need a jacket... we needed a personal fan!!!  It was HOT, complained to management and it didn't get better.  Toughed it out but should have left.  Asked for \"Iced tea\" and received zero ice, and no sweetener.  Asked if they had maybe a cup of ice and some sweet and low, they asked if I had ordered it? Some reason the escalators are down the past few months so be ready for 56 stairs or an elevator ride.  Every time we go it is always something, I no longer order food here as they can't figure out orders and it is always an issue in the middle of a movie to try and fix."}
{"text":"The food tasted OK but you really could not enjoy it. The seats were not adjustable and you were practically eating and lying down. Very uncomfortable! Food was over priced for its quality and the servers kept walking in front of my view.  Very distracting! Bar tenders in the lobby were all kinds of rude and the alcohol was way overpriced. I would recommended IPics!"}
{"text":"I reeeeallyyy wanted to love this theater!  Everyone kept raving about it, supposedly the best in Phoenix.  We arrived & were def wowed by the nice lobby & bar.  The seats we definitely not the most comfortable compared to the other AMC theaters & I found it really distracting with the clanging of forks, drinks being dropped on the floor, servers walking back & forth etc.  I know it's the whole experience that's supposed to be neat but I just didn't find it to be my cup of tea.  The sign said the theater we were in was 21 & older but there were tons of loud kids in there which confused me. I also wish there was an option to turn off the light on the side of your seat when you're done eating.  I found it to be pretty bright.  Glad we checked it off our list but we probably won't be running back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I usually like AMC, I do.  But it seems that everytime we go here, there is a problem.  For example, the other night, we wanted to see Date Night. Both MoviePhone.com and Fandango.com had shows at 8:45 and 9:40.  When we showed up, having missed the 8:45, we wanted to go to the 9:40 show. No one was up front selling tickets, so we had to buy it through the machine. It said it was currently 8:51, and that the only show that night was 8:45.  So we figured with previews we'd be fine, bought the tickets...which then came out of the machine completely smeared and unreadable.  Upon entering the theatre, we realize it was way into the movie, so we check out cell phones. It was actually 9:25 -- the machine's clock was off.  We went back to guest services to get a refund, and were told there was no 9:45.  Then I saw his sheet of paper, and pointed out to him that it SAID 9:45 was the next showing.  After a moment of \"oh, well, I just didn't see that...and the machine is broken\" we asked if we could just go see the 9:45, and were let in.  For the outrageous prices for both tickets and food (and the machine sure doesn't help OR give any student discounts), I'm really underwhelmed.  We'll probably look at another theatre."}
{"text":"Such a fun evening and a nice treat.  I love the comfy seats and attentive service."}
{"text":"Worst experience in a theatre. Sounds good but you have waiters walking in front of you every 2 minutes, or can choose a seat with bad viewing angle. I prefer the old school theatre. This whole-- pick your seat thing is more of a pain than the first come, first serve approach too. Unless you have been there before it is hard to really know where to sit without having someone walk I front of you, and seats are  in pairs so you if you show up with an odd number, one friend gets screwed. The popcorn is disgustingly oily and salty. And, as always, food is overpriced. AMC needs to learn how less can be more"}
{"text":"If you want to have an outstanding experience at the movie Theater, this is it.  I sat in a reclining chair, couldn't see the row behind or in front of me and had a waitress serve my order. I ordered a glass of wine and a bowl of popcorn. This is what a movie theater experience should be!"}
{"text":"We Came here for the extra SERVICE we've come to expect when paying the extra cost.  Arrived for our movie, found our seats, decided on a drink,some popcorn and sushi. We thought the service light may have been out of order when we pushed it, waited 30 mins and were never acknowledged. My better half walked down to the lobby to find someone, and was told someone would be up to take our order. We waited an additional 10 minutes before he went back to the lobby to place our order. No explanation or apology for why we had not been greeted. The food arrived by two different people in about 10 mins.  We ate and wanted a refill of the $6.00 coke.  This time I had to use the restroom so I went and asked for a refill on the way there. The bathroom was filthy. Trash on the floor, wet sinks, clogged sinks and unflushed toilets. The refill arrived 10 mins after I ordered it. Extremely disappointed in the cleanliness and attentiveness of staff.  Our theater only had about 12 other people so I'm wondering if all the staff was attending to Star Wars opening weekend."}
{"text":"Worst. Food. Ever. Everything is legit microwaved and the chicken tastes like rubber. Definitely not worth over $250 spent of the 6 of us. Drinks were not good either and our server was something else- Seats seemed nice but the parking situation is pretty bad. I'd rather pay more per ticket and go to Ipic or Studio Movie grill. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best Theater in the Valley  Reserved seats. Good quality food. Good theater viewing and sound. Clean restrooms. These are the things that I'm looking for in a theater and AMC has nailed it.  The grilled salmon is surprisingly good (and healthy) for a place like this. I get it without the sauce and they supplement it with lots of nicely cooked, crisp broccoli. Their milk shakes are also awesome (with a burger...not the salmon :-) ). I'm not sure we've had a bad meal and my family has spent a lot of time here.  The only suggestion I would have is to improve the checkout process. The servers really do not know how to handle the AMC Stubs accounts properly and often are not readily available as the movie ends."}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only theater I go to.  Yes they have increased the prices a little since it first opened up but it's still cheaper than the over rated Ipic in Scottsdale.    The seats are always super comfy and the food is actually really good.  The food is about average price but the drinks can get pricey.  How can you complain though about getting to eat dinner and have a drink while watching a movie!   One thing to stay away from though are the milkshakes (might as well be ice cream flavored milk) and the burgers I haven't had much luck with as you can't get them cooked to order.  Just about everything else I've tried has been great though."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this movie Theater and would defiantly recommend this for Couples if you have kids keep them at home lol............. This will defiantly be Me and my husbands favorite date night spot. this was our first time at this AMC and I really enjoyed it. the seats were comfortable the server was very polite and prompt on getting our order and refills also the crab dip is very tasty. and I would recommend the fried shrimp it was also very tasty. Great date night would highly recommend this movie Theater to anyone."}
{"text":"The service here is awful. They are insanely slow and literally just forget to bring things. It has happened the last three times I've gone there. The last visit I had to go find the waiter after the movie because he never brought the bill, although he did pre charge the card when I ordered and then never brought me the $8 beer. They are just the worst. And the reviews on the seats are right too. They are really uncomfortable. The tickets and food are overpriced also. I love the location of this theatre, but everything else is horrible."}
{"text":"Management is to be desired and that's putting it mildly.  Someone work with Ricky and the tiny angry child like woman on a power trip."}
{"text":"I went to the dine-in theater last weekend as a treat.  This is my first time experiencing a dine-in theater so I was excited.  I decided to order my tickets in advance on Fandango.  For two tickets the cost came to $30.  This is a little over $10 more than what I'd typically pay for 2 tickets.  However, I did it for the experience.  I arrived at the theater about 15 minutes early in order to make sure that I could order before previews started.  The seats are quite comfortable and you can adjust them to lift the legs up.  You also get a nice long tray to put all your food and beverages on which is attached to the seat.  I ordered water and a cocktail and waited until the server came back to order my food.  I ended up going with the shrimp and fries dish.  The shrimp was jumbo sized and quite good for a theater.  The drink was also pretty good.  The theater has a full bar so you can practically get anything.  The movie viewing experience was standard besides the occasional clinking of silverware and servers making their way through the aisles throughout the movie.  My total bill for two drinks and two entrees came out the $70.  Add that to the price of the ticket and it cost over $100 with tax and tip.  I definitely will only do this on special occasions going forward since it was a little costly in my opinion.  However, definitely a great experience and a very professional staff."}
{"text":"I have gone back a few times, and received much better service each time! Food and drinks are still a bit pricey for what you get, but I would recommend going."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this idea, it cost about the same as if you went to a movie and dinner at a place like chili's or TGIF.  The food is very good and the seats are so comfy you will never want to go to a regular theater again."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review on Yelp in a while, but I felt this place warranted one. The prices here are right on some things... Like the movies. The prices are about the same as a regular movie theater. The food is priced about the same as a restaurant. But the drinks are way overpriced. I ordered a peach shandy \"beer cocktail\" at the bar and it was $12. Yikes. I considered ordering another drink later but the prices talked me out of it. $5.99 for a Bud Light? No thanks. But the worst thing was the service. Someone came over to take our order the minute we sat down so of course we weren't ready. We should have been because it took probably 15 minutes after pressing the button to get a server. Then another 20 minutes to get our food. We were almost halfway through the movie before we got anything. When I finally did get my food, the salsa was pretty spicy, and my drink that was gone by that point. So I pressed the button again. At least another 10 minutes before I got a server and another 5 before I got the water. Everything just took forever. And then the movie ended and we hadn't gotten a check. We easily could've walked out without paying but we didn't. We paid at the bar. Seriously... This is a great concept but the service needs a LOT of improvement."}
{"text":"This cozy theatre is great when you want a little more from your movie experience. I like that they don't price gouge (not like many of the other full-service movie theatres I've been to). The prices are reasonable for the movies and I like the plush seating.   The only issue I have is it's hard to get to unless you know where you are going. This place is tucked away upstairs and I found myself wandering around a bit. However, they do have a very helpful valet downstairs to get you where you need to go. He just happened to be busy when I walked by the first time."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst most disgusting theater I have ever been to. Don't fall for the \"premium power recliner seats\" they falsely advertise on the website. They are covered in duct tape! Yes duct tape. Also if you sit in rows D or higher you cannot see half the screen. Something I reported to management which they responded with yes we have been aware of it for 3 years, but don't disclose on their website which is where you reserve seats. This place is a joke. Don't waste your time for something that is falsely advertised!"}
{"text":"The experience is not what it used to be!  We waited over 20 minutes for napkins/silverware AFTER food was delivered (they were not next to any of the seats like they used to be).  And then came the baby crying and a toddler screaming... throughout the film. We specifically chose the 'Cinema Suite' theater because it has always been 21 and up only. As a group of 4 adults we wanted to enjoy the movie with some nice drinks - screaming really ruined the atmosphere.  I wrote to corporate asking if they changed their 21+ policy and will update this review when I hear from them.    For now I would say STAY AWAY from this theater. While it used to be our favorite theater it has steadily declined over the last year. Driving to the Harkins IMAX in Tempe is worth the extra time!  UPDATE: Yes AMC changed their policy. They no longer have  21+ theaters. I have went back twice since the prior review. First time went during the day (before 5pm) and experienced fussy toddlers during a rated R movie. Second time we went back at night (after 8pm)  after the R rated movie had been out for a couple weeks and there were only adults in the audience. We may go back in the future at night but the Tempe IMAX is significantly better."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, we won't likely return.   First time we had a theatre with plush recliners and less seating. The experience was nice.   The last 2 visits we were in older style chairs. Ripped from wear. Quite frankly, the seats at the Cristown Harkins are more comfortable.   After alerting an employee of a group being disruptive-nothing was done.   We ordered cheesy tots (a bad idea, we should have known better) they were covered in roughly chopped green onion. Almost inedible.   Not worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"I've been to both the Fork & Screen, and Cinema Suites sections of this theater, and have never been disappointed with either. However, as a matter of continual patronage, I really prefer the Cinema Suites, as the chairs are more comfortable.  Overall, both venues are a no hassle way of enjoying the movies without all the interference that detract from the experience. At first glance, you may think that the continual flow of servers who assist patrons with their orders would be a distraction. Nonetheless, the aisles themselves are fairly wide, and the theater is designed in such a way that none of this activity is actually obtrusive.   And the fact that all this open space reduces the number of patrons per theater is an added bonus.  The only bad experiences we have had so far were with a fork and screen that had sticky floors (probably someone spilled a drink), and slow service in the Cinema Suites.   Otherwise, the food has been good, and the venue is a great departure from a traditional theater.  We almost always exclusively come here now to watch movies."}
{"text":"Went on 6/16/17 with the family to see Cars 3. When we arrived at the seats, they were dirty. Cup holders were full of trash, trays weren't cleaned and there was even tomato on my arm rest. It took quite a while for someone to return with a less than clean looking rag to wipe it off. The popcorn was pretty good, the food was mediocre at best. (We had chicken tenders, Mac n cheese and a burger.)  While the poor food quality and lack of cleanliness was enough to make us not return, the overall lack of good manners by other customers sealed the deal. This movie theatre was the equivalent of being at Chuck E Cheese with kids shouting, crying and running around the place. It was a very expensive and not enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Clean theater but the food was over priced and not that good. When I tried the sushi and it tasted bad and asked the waitress, her response was no one likes it and sends it back. If that's the case take it off the menu!"}
{"text":"Our go-to theater these days is the Esplanade AMC, mostly because of it's proximity to home.   Reserving seats is really nice because you can come to the movie right on time and be sure to have a great seat. If we find out the movie is in the larger theater, I'm bummed, because I prefer the smaller theaters with the full reclining chairs and a little more space - great for date nights.  I'm not a fan of the movie ticket price, so we try to come when there is a special running such as $5 moves on Tuesdays around the holidays. I also don't love having a server come by during the movie, or having the lights on next to each seat, but it is nice having someone deliver food (popcorn for me please!) when you get to the theater late."}
{"text":"This was my first upscale, premiere dine-in movie theatre experience. It was fabulous, the seats are so comfortable and the servers serve (okay) food and alcohol! There is nothing better than this as long as you are drinking wine during a Jennifer Aniston movie! The theatre we sat in had la-z-boy recliners which you can fall asleep in at any moment. The previous theatre the last time I was here had regular seats, nothing special and paid extra for the ticket. It seems the type of seats vary per theatre so be aware if you buy tickets for a showing.  I don't think I will ever go back to your \"typical movie theatre\" if I have the option again!"}
{"text":"Great setup. Nice bar. Terrible service. Comfy recliner seats.  Buying tickets is an awkward process. Ticket kiosks don't work very well (all of the printers were down. Couldn't buy rated R tickets at the kiosk).   Front desk lady was very short and somewhat rude. She didn't seem to know if the theater offered military discounts on tickets and simply responded \"I don't see it....\" .... OK..?... Also, would have been nice to be informed which row was the front/rear row when picking seats on the diagram. Would have saved me a second trip back to guest services.  Heavily priced items but the novelty is cool of being served. Press the button on the comfy recliners and your waiter is summoned.  Highly recommend the Parmesan fries!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I now watch movies. Its clean, good food, great drinks, good service and no screaming babies. It's pricey but I'm willing to pay it so I can enjoy watching the movie instead of wondering when the kid behind me will stop kicking my seat."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I used to LOVE to see movies here. My hubby and I are huge movie goers  at least 5-6 movies a month. However my last two trips here have been horrible! Saturday night the theater was so hot I could hardly breath on top of this my seat was broken. I am 5 month pregnant and my waitress felt bad so she said she would get someone to fix the chair.... It took about 15 min of me standing on the side but it did get fixed.   Then today we went back to the movies - different theater this time however, same problem the chair was broken. We were early before the lights went off so I called the waitress over. This time the waitress said to us \" I know it's broken I told my manager during the last movie but I guess he choose not to fix it\" this one was really uncomfortable.... I could hardly sit. She said she would go talk to her manager and see if he would fix it the .  15 min later The waitress came back and said \" sorry there is noway for us to fix now that the lights are off\"  so I stuck it out and watched the movie. They then proceeded to charge me $7 for tea- not even a compt drink. This manager working today on 11-23-14 should really learn what Customer service is. I'm not sure I will be back. I'm willing to drive 10 more min to scottsdale."}
{"text":"Best theater out there.  Dine-in, assigned seating, comfortable chairs, and no ghetto teenagers talking throughout the movie.  If you want ghetto, head over to Christown theater..."}
{"text":"Never really had a problem here. The crowds aren't awful like the other theaters around me. Annnd it's close to the Gelato Spot, so I can smuggle in some treats.   But what's up with the totally rank sewage odor that you have to suffer through while you go up the escalators? You'd think that in such a nice, upscale area as that, they'd want to fix that immediately, but it's been like that as long as I've been a patron."}
{"text":"Great theater. . Greg and I are movie buffs, were at a movie,  at least once if not twice a week. We spend most of our time at the Esplanade.  Its a good theater.  Unfortunately the food is not my favorite AT ALL.  But,  in general,  the atmosphere of the place is great."}
{"text":"This theatre is run by amateurs.  I knew something was wrong when the theatre was not showing the usual AMC promos but was assured that this was because it was the first show of the day.  Finally, right when the movie was scheduled to start the alleged manager came in reporting the file was corrupted and it would take two hours to download.  I guess checking a movie before it is run is outside the thinking capacity of this crowd.  Never again!!"}
{"text":"The chair I sat in was broken and so eating laying half down was a little difficult! c6 was the number.. don't  get that seat! The menu, dinner food and service was great... but the popcorn was old and cheery and they didn't have red vines! Awwww so it was average but not as relaxing as I hoped! They need to put some beauty and cleaning and better seats in the place. I expected better for the Esplanade!"}
{"text":"An older theater that's keeping up with the new kids! Comfy, reserved seats with food service with a smile without the astronomical cost found at other luxury theaters. Food was pretty good, or with the great location, you could just go for the show and scope out one of the many nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a Quality over Quantity decision, folks.  You pay a premium for these seats, but they are easily 2x as comfortable, you aren't crowded with others, there are no screeming kids in strollers, in general this is a more upscale audience where you are not likely to get in the middle of a gang fight, etc.  For me, I made the decision to take my family's usual movie going schedule, and spend 1/2 of those seeing a movie at home with Redbox for $1, and half the time taking my family to this theater, paying $2-5 per ticket premium, and having more fun.  The food is Applebees in a theater, basically, with a $3-4 premium per dish for getting served at your seat.  Again, if you were going to an Applebees quality restaurant, pay the premium.  It's fun.  If you wanted upscale, there are lots of restaurants in the complex or across the street (use the tunnel, it's cool!).  One thing I recommend is skipping the popcorn.  It's a small bag, isn't as fresh as a usual theater, and runs $8.  No thanks.  If you want to spend $8, spend it on real food or candy.    For me, the difference between watching a movie in a theater like Harkins Christown or in AMC Esplanade is like the difference between First Class and a middle seat in Coach on a 12 hour transoceanic flight.  Yes, it's that big.    But it only costs $2-4 per ticket premium folks.  That's money well spent.  I mean, for me, it's a complete, total, no-brainer.  By the way, unlike the other reviews, the adults only theaters ARE more comfortable seats, but not THAT much more comfortable.  So if you have an equal choice, go with the adults only theater seats, but if not, don't be scared... still do it."}
{"text":"SSLLOOOWWW service. Had three different people serving us so no wonder one drink was forgotten till we asked again for it. Had to inquire when food would be delivered, it took so long. Check was handed to us without asking if we wanting anything more. Seats not so comfortable. If I wanted to recline, I'd stay home. Don't go hungry."}
{"text":"Disappointing this time...  logistical difficulties to start... 10 minutes before show time still cleaning with large crowd waiting.  Loooooonnnnnng preview and advertising - probably a management attempt to allow for some buffer to take orders, etc.   not the worst idea, I guess.    Matinee show so no major food for us.  Popcorn, sodas and trying the churros out.   Overall, food was as one would expect for a movie:  greasy, salty, sweet.    Several annoying problems during the movie.  Interrupted repeatedly by runners trying to bring us other people's orders.   The one thing I did request (a simple Diet Coke refill) was a no show - despite asking twice.   Oh well.  Seats weren't comfortable and the last shows popcorn was still all over - despite the delay for cleaning...   Have been here several times and quality has been slowly fading, but today was definitely an acceleration."}
{"text":"They just switched from a traditional theater to a \"dine-In\" theater. More food options are available in lobby or during movie via waiter service. Bigger more comfortable, leather chairs in Fork & Dine screens & leather recliners in suites. You will be paying more for these seats as far fewer seats in theaters. Bacon Cheeseburger and Smoked salmon BLT are nothing spectacular, average at best. Burgers not cooked below medium well"}
{"text":"I love this theatre. The first time my husband took me there as a surprise I was so impressed! The Cinema Suite are amazing. Each person has there own extremely comfortable recliner. I have had many meals here and the food is pretty good. The big bonus about this theatre is that they have alcohol! It is so fun to enjoy a beer or cocktail as you recline and watch a movie :) It is a bit more expensive than other theatres, but so very worth it! Especially for a treat."}
{"text":"The chairs in the \"Cinema Suites\" are The. Most. Comfortable. EVER. The service is great. It does make for a pricey movie going experience, but once in awhile, you gotta Treat. Yo. Self. This is my treat to self of choice."}
{"text":"AMC Esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new \"Dinner and a Movie\" blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate (that's right, I just referenced Blue Ocean Strategy, get over it).  No, it's not an extremely enlightened idea. I've been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger. Like \"Don't mind this $9 full meal over here, we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold.\")  Yes, it's more expensive than a regular ticket. Almost double for the nice seats. But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS. You will regret not getting the $15 seats if you don't buy the $15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home.   This theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable. I saw The Master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled Bacardi flask if I didn't have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it. I seriously won't go to a movie anywhere else and I guarantee you'll say the same once you go. FIVE STARS."}
{"text":"For years I've enjoyed going to the movies here The cinema suites HAD the best seats in town  So large and comfy  Just went last night They got cheap and replaced the once comfy recliners  Now they have the same uncomfortable chairs that all the others have Seats go back just enough to keep you squirming trying to be comfy and leave with a hurting back and neck I used to go to the movies once a week Won't be going back AMC"}
{"text":"Worst theatre experience ever, seriously avoid this place.  Deadpool 2 was to start at 12:30. \"Pre-show\" ads played til 12:40. There were then 20 minutes of trailers. The 12:30 film did not start until 1:00. That is simply ridiculous.  Beyond that: 1. The place is dirty. 2. Servers walk around with lit cell phones to take orders. 3. A server was arguing with a guest about his bill during the last few minutes of the movie. 4. Severe lack of signage to find the theatre and parking."}
{"text":"I've come back a few times to give this location another shot since my last review and unfortunately still the same sad experience. This location has so much potential consider the fact that it is in the heart of the Biltmore area. Plenty of parking in the garage which is validated for four hours. Easy access to restaurants and shops for a night out experience but not worth paying extra money for service that is not up to par with restaurant standards.   My last experience was on July 4th at 1:20 pm. My trays were nasty. So bad that I went to the restroom grabbed a paper towel to wet it and wipe the trays that I would be eating on. Imagine going to a restaurant and eating at a dirty table.  Same situation. My menus were sticky which seems to be an ongoing issue at this theater. My server was quick to come take my order but did not receive everything which is kitchen error as I saw him type it in. The first thing to come was my fries not our drinks. They were luke warm. No silverware. The whole row I sat in did not have napkins or utensils. After asking three times for it and wait staff delivery food who kept telling us it was coming it never came. After nearly finishing my food, along with everyone else in my row who all had to eat our food without utensils. I walked down to the bar to ask for it. I was told they ran out and it will take 15 mins to clean everything. I asked for at least paper bar napkins because popcorn butter and pizza grease is not fun all over your hands. The server provided me with some and came to drop off silverware 15 mins later. By that time we were done. No apology. I understand things happen but we should have been told this every time someone asked. I find it disappointing that a dine in theater did not have the proper utensils to provide when serving meals.  The bathrooms were perfect and well stock. The movie played great they just can't get the service down."}
{"text":"This place is sweet.  It eliminates the sucky parts of going to a theater (finding a seat crammed next to a stranger, needing more popcorn during the movie) and replaces them with wait service, seat assignments, and comfy chairs!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was a mediocre experience. Obviously, the concept is a great idea- food, drinks, and a movie all at your reclining seat. However, we ordered our tickets and the only seats for four together were the back row; which was no biggie. When we sat down and reclined though, the ledge was blocking our view-so much so that we had to physically pick up and move our seats. Sounded like a great solution until we had to put our recliners down so that the servers could come by each and every time.  The food wasn't too bad, but the kitchen was forty minutes behind..."}
{"text":"I am in love with the cinema suite! Being able to stretch out your legs on the LazyBoy recliner is the way to enjoy the movie. The chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with viewers.  The foods are at a reasonable price and the server is nice. For movie that are 2+ hours long, watching movie on the recliner is the best experience. Also great place to go on a date :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I will not be returning to this venue. During portions of the movie we could hear staff in the foyer laughing it up and talking about schedules which killed the mood of the scenes. In the meantime, we waited way too long on serving basics such as drink refills, napkins and cutlery to go with the food. Overall food was okay except for some over salted/peppered chicken. Afterwards, these issues were addressed with a non-chalant manager whose response was to give us free movie and dinner tickets which I regifted immediately. He seemed more annoyed to get another complaint than making it an opportunity to educate his staff. Overall, based on the myriad of other reviews, this place is going to be a gamble."}
{"text":"Great theatre, horrible manager.  The manager was working the cash register and told us that they only had front row seats left for our show.  We looked online and came back to the front after discovering that there were plenty of upper row seats available.  Her excuse for telling us there were only front row available was because she thought that my 5'6 girlfriend wouldn't be able to see over the ledge. She also told us that the front row seats were better because they reclined and the others didn't, which was not true."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill over the years. We thought we had ordered the Cine-Suites but I didn't realize in the description it mentioned it. :-(   We are in the first showing at 9:30am and it's a little sticky."}
{"text":"Ordered food even though I wasn't hungry just because I could. Nowhere like it in NorCal."}
{"text":"What started off to be a nice experience quickly fizzled when an hour after leaving the theatre we realized we were given the wrong credit card. We had to go back to the theatre. My husband spoke to the manger and the senior manager about the issue. They were pleasant, apologized, took down his information so if the other girl comes back with our card they will call us. They also sent him off with a bunch of coupons for free appetizers bogo entrees and a few movie passes. That would have been a very kind gesture if they didn't EXPIRE on 10/15/2011 being that today is 10/9/2011. The few movie passes don't expire for a year which is nice.  Those \"might\" make up for the time it takes for me to cancel my credit card, change my auto pays to a new card etc.  Tip for the Esplanade: Please give your servers flashlights so they can give out the right credit card to the right customer. (On a side note: our friends that went with us were given the wrong change and had to let the server know or they would have been short-changed)  We will stick with Harkins at Fashion Square."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to AMC dine in theater, I had the burger which was good she had the macaroni and cheese which was cold so she sent it back.  We both shared the macaroni and cheese which was returned to us luke warm.   Within four hours she was violently ill shortly after I experience the same symptoms, we were both severely ill for the next two days, i'm guessing Norwalk virus.  I contacted the Maricopa County health department, I will no longer eat at this establishment."}
{"text":"Ehhh. It was Ok.   Honestly it was a bit of a letdown.  I have been to both luxury theaters in Las Vegas (North Las Vegas and Henderson) and even one in Bangkok, Thailand(Siam Paragon Mall), so I was pretty pumped to experience something similar in Phoenix during a recent visit. I'm sorry, but this one just did not stack up to the others.   It wasn't horrible, though. Our party of 4 went to see the latest Transformers movie in 3D. Matinee tickets were fairly priced at $11 each. Not a problem there. The picture and sound quality were on point, which made the movie easy to enjoy. The A/C was set at a nice \"deep-freeze\" level, which I greatly appreciate during the face-melting Phoenix summer!  However, there were a few things that were lacking here...  - the seats did not fully recline, which was probably the biggest disappointment here, they would ease back a few inches...but thats it...ehhh..not impressed.. - you just hit a button by your seat to order your food, and while our hostess(?) was very nice(and busy), it got to be distracting from the movie, when you ordered, than when you received your food, than when you got your bill, again when they picked up all the tabs, again when they returned for your signiture, and yet again to deliver your receipt.....and if you want refills, of course you will be visited again..  I understand its all necessary, but i would miss snipits of the movie here and there and it wasn't really an optimal situation.. - $4.50 for a 20 oz soda...ouch...at least kiss me first! -$8.50 for a popcorn, one size only....comparable to a medium at most other places...with 1 free refill..popcorn was tasty though  Overall, it wasn't bad...but I have simply experienced better.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and the food is just great.  Today I had the pizza and it was the best I've ever had. Have not had an avg or bad meal here.  Far better food then most restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! As good as it gets - the leather reclining seats are like flying first class in an airplane, the food is great, there is a button to call the waiter if you want to order anything else - definitely try it!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family and totally felt discriminated against. The server came and asked if we wanted anything we order some popcorn and sodas and I guess he didn't like our choices.. next thing we knew he came up with his manager and we basically got kicked out. Manager didn't do it in a professional manner. His reasoning was that it was an 21 and over side of the theater and that my son who was 8 months wasn't allowed in there even though it was 10am and there was no one in the theater just us! Horrible horrible horrible...."}
{"text":"The only pro was that this is way better than studio movie grill but nowhere close to ipic. I'm so glad we had a gift card because I would've been pissed if we were spending our own money.  Cons: 1. The seat I was in had tears which made it totally uncomfortable in my shorts.  2. They were out of the espresso mix 3. It took 30 minutes to get an iced tea, water and popcorn 4. The servers are not very well versed in customer service  Only way I'm going back is if we have a gift card again."}
{"text":"Eh. The idea is cool but unfortunately this place doesn't meet me expectations.  The seats in the theaters with recliners are awesome! Tons of space and the chairs are comfortable. The service was fast and the employees are very nice.  The last time I went, we were in one of the larger theaters due to the moving being a new release. The service was still fast but these seats are so crammed together. They do not recline and your knees are maybe a few inches from touching the seat in front of you. They are still the cushion type seats but are not comfortable due to how close they all are.  As for the food, falls flat and it's overpriced. I would compare it to the microwaved food from Applebee's, but honestly, it is worse. No flavor and cold. I would guess the tickets to be the same as a regular theater due to the price of the food but the tickets are also more expensive. I know there are plenty of other theaters in the valley with big comfy reclining chairs and the ticket prices are normal.    My last visit the movie was at 10:30, we arrived very early and waited. It took them over 45 minutes to clean the theater and we were not allowed to enter until 10:30, the start time of the movie. This was an inconvenience because they started it up right away giving no one time to really get settled after waiting for the staff forever. I've never had this happen before. I've always been able to enter a theater at least 15 minutes before the previews to get settled in. Maybe they need more staff for cleaning the larger theaters when there are new releases.  ...... And to be honest eating mediocre food in the dark that I can't first see scares me a little."}
{"text":"Only 32 seats in the theater. They are luxurious and motorized fully reclinable old man leather couch chairs. So comfy. Sound was great. Matinee prices very reasonable. I did not take advantage of the full bar or waitstaff food service, but may next time.  Location is sort of odd, across the street from mall area; but there is a walkway underneath the busy street."}
{"text":"I like this place. The food is not that great though. I kind of feel like it's pre-made and then heated up for each person.   What I like:   Nice fancy atmosphere  Comfortable chairs  Helpful service  Plenty of Staff  You can drink in the movie   What I don't like..   The food.. Don't order the quesadilla, mac and cheese or chicken tenders...   The burger is OK...   I love going to this theater and I will keep going, but I don't know if I will order food again, unless I'm starving. The theater would be exceptional if the food was more tasty. I also feel like movies are better when  you go there because you don't have to worry about anything. There is plenty of space in your big comfy chair, the wait staff is at the push of a button and you can always get a good seat. They even ran back to get kid sized 3D glasses.   I have seen 3 movies here so far and am making plans for girl's night to see more in the future, but like I said, I will most likely only order popcorn and maybe dessert to eat."}
{"text":"Love the chairs and the screen experience.  Parts I don't like: While at the bar I noticed the bar back drop some clean cups and water pitchers on the floor as he opened a cabinet. I watched to see if they would clean them after, but they didn't. They took them and filled them with water to be used in the movies. This kind of grossed me out. For god sake if it touches the floor it shouldn't touch your mouth! If I were the manager I would have made those kids use a cup I had just put on the dirty floor.  Alcoholic drinks are really expensive considering how much ice they put in the cups, food and soda is only slightly expensive considering you are in a movie and soda refills are free. My girlfriends mojito didn't taste good at the bar, but the bar tender agreed to add more syrup to correct the flavor.  I would go back, but hope they increase their sanitary standards and lower cocktail prices."}
{"text":"for frequent movie goers this theater might be a different experience. large seats, usually quieter than other AMC's"}
{"text":"Renovations had this theater closed for a time and I recently attended the soft reopening of their dine-in theater dubbed \"Fork & Screen\". A promotion they sponsored \"won\" me four tickets to see \"The Hangover Part II\", though things didn't go quite as planned.   While I was promised four tickets via the internet, when I went to print them, only two were available. In addition, while my guest and I arrived early, we were promptly told at the front door that the movie had been sold out. (More on that later.) Disappointed, my guest and I were about to leave when a good Samaritan offered us two tickets to see another move, Limitless. Glad the night wasn't a complete loss, we were happy to wait an additional half hour for the showtime of that particular film.   During our wait we sat at what was formerly the concession stand, now renovated into a bar called \"MacGuffins\". We each drank Blue Moon and while cold, it wasn't the best flavor I've had. I can't quite put my finger on it, but will say they were competitively priced compared to local pubs. While this particular evening was probably a dry run for the staff, as well, I think they need to make an effort to get the table numbers straight. During the 30 or so minutes we sat at a pub table, we were approached by three additional servers (besides our own) bringing food we never ordered.   The staff was very friendly and had been well coached on educating the public about the dine-in theater experience (and multiple offers for their version of a prepaid card.) In fact, one of the servers chatted us up so much he eventually offered to show us what the upgraded \"suites\" looked like. We got a quick peak and saw a theater with limited (reservation only, I believe) seating featuring roomy reclining seats and from what I've been told, will have an expanded suite-only menu available. If memory serves, I believe these seats will be about $2.00 more than seats in standard theaters. (And probably worth it for for quiet factor, alone.)  We arrived inside the actual theater and while our Good Samaritan had given us his extra tickets, they were not beside one another and an usher attempted to locate a pair of side-by-side seats.  He was able to accommodate us after a short wait, but I was confused as the theater was half empty and I couldn't understand the fuss.  It made me wonder if the movie we actually had intended to see and were told was sold out might also have been half empty.   In the theater where we were seated we found chairs that rock back a bit, but do not fully recline. Frankly, I didn't feel they were the most comfortable. Each seat has its own swing out tray table, a call button and a small light. The light is useless as it is situated about four inches behind where your elbow might rest and isn't bright enough to read a menu or see your food. Our server was friendly and our order arrived promptly and hot, though the food was forgettable. Most of the menu options are similar to pub food. I had Buffalo Chicken Fingers, french fries and a Diet Coke. My guest had the Bacon Cheeseburger, french fries and a Sprite. Neither meal seemed to be anything more than processed food.   While it was a promotional evening where the movie tix, entrees and fountain drinks were comped, had I paid for it all myself (nearly $85 with tip) I would have preferred to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cocktails and food with little distraction. It's the same price as you would pay regularly, and the food is yummy. It's our new favorite movie experience so far.  Great date night!"}
{"text":"Great idea but save yourself $75 and invite yourself over to the house of the buddy who has the nice home theater.  You can bring Chili's takeout since that is about on par with what they serve here.  All told you still save about $30 and you can get by with taking off your shoes and getting really comfortable."}
{"text":"Place was not as clean as last time and seats were ripped up..Food was too expensive for what we received..Will not return."}
{"text":"Love this theatre! The Cinema Suites are for ages 21 and over only and have stadium seating with high walls so that you can't see the row in front of you or in back of you. The seats are huge and have two arm rests and recline. Food and drink ordering service is available from your seat - simply push a button and someone will come to take your order. The only major flaw is the walls are too high in the back rows, so the bottom of the screen gets cut off when you recline. Still 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very nice movie theatre. I didn't order any food, but I did order an Angry Orchard Cider on tap which was perfect! Our server was Jason and he was one of the nicest people I've encountered at a movie theatre. He was very prompt and somehow said everything with a smile.  The reason I didn't give another star is because the seats were a little uncomfortable. I'm fairly tall with long legs and any time I repositioned myself I would accidentally kick the seat in front of me. I'll pay more attention to where the seats are located to check for more leg room next time."}
{"text":"The only place for an adult to enjoy a movie.  We regularly drive out of our way for super comfy seats, beer while we watch and friendly service.   We generally don't get food anymore as it is all very old ballpark like.  Lacking flavor etc.  I think I've tried 5 items and all are very out of a package foods."}
{"text":"OK, here it is folks....I've been to this theater before and ran into the escalators being broken down and having to use the elevator(way too long a wait!---Not fun)  but the whole idea of the theater's location is a nice one, and yes, the movies seem to be a bit less macabre there and the maturity of the over-all crowd seems to have less crying children than many other theaters.  Last night though, I experienced the rank sewage smell (throughout the complex) with a friend (bad smells are the worst and most offensive to me!), theater #13 was filthy and unkempt, and the parking underground was a mess again! I'm sorry, but if I should decide to go on a date any time soon or to impress a friend, I might have to strongly reconsider my theater choices.  Possibly go to Fashion Square in Snottsdale (Oh well)--At least I know what to expect there!  To me and my friend, the smell was the worst!  Sorry, this theater gets only two stars."}
{"text":"This place is great! When my friend I went here, it was my first experience with a dine-in theatre.   Our server was so friendly and prompt.  I expected bland cafeteria food. I was worried it would taste like it came out of a TV dinner cardboard box but their food is seriously not bad!  I had mac and cheese and was very happy with my choice.  Only downside, I could barely see my dinner or the menu. Luckily, I am not a messy eater!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING We decided to see a 6:30 pm movie at AMC Dine-in Theatres Esplanade 14. My daughter spent the previous 48 hours at her grandmothers, so the only food that my wife (Shawn) and daughter ate together in the last 48 hours was the mac and cheese at the AMC Dine-in Theatres Esplanade 14.   We went to see a kids movie with my daughter Kylee and her friend. Tickets for the 4 of us were $42. We justified it because of the comfortable seating and food service in the theater. Sure we could have waited for the movie to hit NetFlix, but we wanted to make the evening special. And boy was it ever!  On the way home Kylee  and Shawn talked about how bad the food tasted and we decided to keep it to drinks only in the future because of how poor the food is at the Theater. Little did we know that the food we were complaining about would be coming up again later that night.  My wife flew out of the bed at about midnight and made a mad dash for the toilet. She was in a cold sweat and groaning with pain from her abdominal section. She said she was afraid she was going to pass out. We'll pass on describing what was coming out of her body and where. Finally, after about 45 minutes she made it back to bed feeling like Rocky Balboa had been in the ring with her for 12 rounds.  I figured that we were past all this now and the family would finally get some much needed rest. We soon entered into REM only to be awoken within the hour. It was my daughter. She was vomiting while sitting on the toilet. Same symptoms that Shawn had. Eventually we all went back to bed. We were worried that Kylee's friend who went to the movie with us was going to be next. Luckily she did not eat the mac. I did not eat at the theater, so I was out of the woods.  Conclusion: we didn't mind spending $100+ for a family evening of fun. However, we will not be doing any eating in the AMC Dine-in Theatres Esplanade 14 again. I don't know what goes on in that kitchen behind the scenes, and frankly don't want to know.  Recommendation: Watch more movies at home"}
{"text":"My hubby heard a few people talking about this movie theater for awhile so for his BDAY I took him there to see \"Man of Steel\" this past weekend.  The theater is cool but it was getting to and from there through the garage that made the experience a little frustrating.  Those signs are not helpful.  Well, at least, don't do what we did.  We took the elevator through the garage.  I hit the starred button for the first floor and the thing shot up to the sixth floor and just sat there.  After about a minute, we panicked.  We hit a bunch of buttons and still no movement.  Finally we had to call security.  This went on for a good 10 minutes.  Finally, I hit another button and it took us to the basement.  Not sure if security came or not cause when we got out, we ran for it.  Coming back we were able to see our car from where we parked on the Gila Monster level but getting to it was like going through a maze.  It felt like a Twilight Zone episode where the stairs never take you anywhere.  It was like an endless climb.  Like I said, the theater is way cool but the directions need to be more direct."}
{"text":"Love this place - Definitely prefer the Cinema Suites to the Fork and Screen.  At Cinema Suites you get a full on horizontal recliner!  It is an amazing way to watch at movie.  I would definitely recommend buying tickets in advance, sometimes it sells out or you will have trouble getting two together.  The food is pretty good - mostly just regular ole stuff like chicken fingers, salads, burgers, etc.  There is also an alcohol menu.  As I expected, the food and drinks are pretty pricey, but it's worth the splurge when you are going for a big night out to the movies.  Definitely unique and super comfortable way to watch a movie!"}
{"text":"I've only been to two theaters since moving to the Valley.  Although I live closer to Harkins at Fashion Square, one experience there was enough for me.  I find this theater relatively clean and free of screaming brats.  That's about all I need to be happy.  I've never noticed the gas smell in the parking garage or encountered the broken escalators, but my husband always insists we take the stairs.  As if that's going to counteract the bucket of popcorn and 55-gallon drum of Coke!  Getting out of the garage can test your patience, though.  Beware of the lunatics whipping around the corners oblivious to the concept of driving on the right side.    Best time to go is the 10 am showings on Fridays.  Garages are empty, theaters are empty, and it's only $5.  Now you have just enough money to buy a candy bar with the change from your twenty."}
{"text":"Extremely impressive movie theatre! I was in Awwwe over the views from this AMC theatre. The Arizona surrounding mountains are breathtaking! The theatre itself is pretty special. It was my first experience at a movie theatre that has a full on menu of food, alcoholic beverages and many other items that you can order from your seat. The AMC staff was great. I appreciated their service. The seats are leather, each seat has it's own pull out table and service call-light."}
{"text":"Used my $2 T-Mobile Tuesday special for my movie.  Plenty of money to splurge on my dine in fare = priceless ;)  4 stars cuz who wants to pay for parking at a mall ??"}
{"text":"This theatre needed the remodel, because people started to forget it was there! I went last night to see the Breaking Dawn Premier and was quite impressed.  The tickets are expensive, but you are paying to have no one under 21 in the cinema suites (the theaters with the recliners), unlimited soft drink, coffee, and tea refills.  The food comes out quick, which is good because when they turn off the lights you can't see your food unless you push it way back towards the little lights.  Don't be put off by the prices, the portion sizes are pretty ample.  another drawback is they keep all the theaters SO cold that your food gets cold :("}
{"text":"So I go here allot, not going to review every time I go, but to say the least my experiences are always just OK. This time they lose a star due to the fact that, this place just seem to be getting worse every time I go.   First...its dirty, they could use a thorough cleaning. I mean its a movie theater, its generally gross. And it keeps getting dirtier, I feel at least once a month these things need to be cleaned  to the max. they are not.   Second...the food quality has gone down hill. I can only assume that the kitchen like the rest of the place is starting to get run down and since the theaters aren't clean, I can only assume the restaurant kitchen isn't either. And it's overpriced. To pay what you ask me to pay, $10 for shrimp that taste like it went bad, and $4.00 for a glass of ice tea. A little much...seriously $4.00 for tea. IT'S TEA.   Lastly for as much as they gouge you, the service sucks. Most of the time, you will press your little button and not see a server for 10 minutes, they are either understaffed, but most the time I am there I just see staff hanging on either end of the bar or standing around talking outside the theaters in the hallway.  And a final tip, try not to tuck the validater for the valet parking away until everyone leaves, so I don't feel like I am getting looked at like I am robbing the place when I have to go behind the ticket counter to get my parking verified.   Please step it up AMC. I do enjoy movies...which is truthfully the only reason this review got 2 stars...but not your business."}
{"text":"Purchased tickets for Gold at 5pm....get there and they had canceled our movie.  WTF!!  I didn't want to see replacement movie.  What a waste of a Sunday ....pissed me off!!  Lost our money!!!"}
{"text":"OK, let me start by saying that my preferred Theater is Harkins... I am a very 'thrifty' person and rarely we go out without using a coupon or some kind of promotional prices. I buy Harkins tickets in bulk and I can take a family of 4 to the movies with popcorn and drinks for $30-34.  That said, we occasionally go to AMC, and each and every time I cannot believe they can get away with those prices, particularly the concessions, not offering regular student discounts, etc...  However, I understand that you get what you pay for, and for some this is the place and environment they want regardless of the price.  Back to the actual review : )  * Hubby drinks industrial amounts of diet coke, so the small glass cup that we got when we got ther was the first... \"what?\" It looks and feels like a bar.. (is it a bar?) so it seems appropriate to tip your server, so for more than we were expecting to pay we got a glass full of ice that hubby finished in a couple of sips : P  * Once we were seated, it seems it took a long time for a server to come and take our order... perhaps like 30 minutes or so?  * I didn't think the menu options were that attractive, someone in a review compared the place to Chili's and I kind of agree with that... I am not a big fan of Chili's though...  * We decided to share a chicken/chipotle quesadilla... which was good and the portion was generous. If you ask me, the sauce was a little too sweet, but oh well... It was OK.  * It seems to me the dish comes with a side (chips were pictured), and while taking our order our server asked \"Chips or fries?\", at the end we had an extra charge for choosing fries. I understand if there is a charge, but I believe servers should make you aware at the time you place your order. Something like... \"It comes with chips, would you like fries for an additional charge?\"  Up until this, it would have been 3 stars, but...  *I didn't think the seats were that comfortable... they didn't seem to recline and the angle was kind of weird.  * Honestly, I thought the place was nasty. The small tables have some metal pieces and are not flat, obviously this makes them tricky to clean but that is not an excuse. They had marks of being poorly wiped, there were crumbs on my area, even garbage and a cherry stem in my cup holder...   * Over 30 minutes - Over 30 minutes it took for my husband to get a refill for his drink...  * And, my pet peeve... pop corn bags were not full, they were about or more than an inch below the edge or the bag. Argggghhh...  * This must have been a very nice and impressive experience when everything was brand new... not now, not for us.  Disclaimer - I attended a free screening here, so I did not really get the 'full price paying customer' experience, however, I think that should not make a difference. OR even worse, I would be even more disappointed if I had to pay admission on top of what we spent.  On the bright side, this area is very nice to go for a walk after your movie, if you go on the evenings : )"}
{"text":"I dig this place.  I have yet to eat here, but friends who have said its good.  I really like picking out my seats ahead of time and not fighting a crowd on busy weekends.  The popcorn is pricey @ $8.50 for a big bowl with a refill. Come on Explanade, it's popped corn and it costs you 50 cents. You've already got our premium paid for the seat, throw us a bone!"}
{"text":"To keep it short. Ranged two buzzers to order food kid took 20 minuets to get to me and my girl. Specifically asked for diet said (she's diabetic) brought her regular soda ( this could have killed her if she kept drinking it) ranges bell took another 10 for the kid to come back. Got food chicken tenders and fries food was overly salted couldn't eat it. Ranged two bells again to have food taken back kid never came. At end of movie since the kid never came to pick up bill went down said had an issue would like item removed. Kid told me I should have said something during the movies. Without embarrassing him and telling him that we ranged for you twice and waited over 15 mins I just said I rather waited until the end to enjoy the movie. Even had the full plate of food that I didn't eat with me. The kid told me I don't think my manger is going to do anything because you waited until the end Of the movie. This incipient alone is the reason I will never come back. Rather go to studio movie grill, iPic or Alamo Drafthouse."}
{"text":"When a movie I want to see comes out, this is the place I go to. I think it has to do more with the fact I can reserve my seat and I can order food that will be delivered to me. I like how I dont have to scramble to find a seat or rush to make the movie on time and hope a seat is there.  I do like some of their food selection, BUT they need better drink selection, Not everyone likes just coke and sprite! The only other flaw I can think they have is the wait time on refills is a bit long, the movies ends up being almost over."}
{"text":"Forget having to schedule your dinner reservations around the movie you're going to see. AMC Esplanade 14 in the Biltmore area of Phoenix underwent major renovations, turning its 14 theaters into chic dine-in auditoriums where viewers reserve their seats and get restaurant-quality service as they fill up on food and drinks while watching the flicks.  This is only the ninth AMC dine-in theater in the nation, with the next closest one being all the way in Kansas City. The new theaters' capacities range from 32-136, so each visit is way more intimate that the traditional movie-going experience.  The first cool thing about the theater is the MacGuffins bar that greets you when you walk in. It's replaced the concessions stand, with the kitchen behind the bar. I love the drinking-and-movie combination, since a lot of times alcohol can make a mediocre movie that much more fun. It's also a great place to hang out and catch up before the movie or discuss the film afterward, and the bar is fully stocked with everything from beer and wine to mimosas and martinis.  There are two types of theaters at the new AMC-nine Fork & Screen theaters and five Cinema Suites theaters. The Fork & Screen have more seats, and they're also the ones that will be showing all-ages movies. They have great comfy chairs with little lights you can push next to them to get a server to come around, and the seats are spread out enough to where nothing feels cramped.  While the whole venue is technically 18-and-older throughout, kids younger than 18 can come with someone 21-and-older.  The Cinema Suites theater have a more luxurious feel to them in the sense they have less seats and the chairs are absolutely amazing. You can just sink into them and recline almost to the point of lying down. Those theaters are exclusively for people ages 21-and-older, and they have the same set-up where you push a light to get a server's attention.  Each seat in the theaters has a menu and silverware next to it, along with a tray that slides out right in front of your seat. It's actually possible to be reclining while eating, which is really cool and makes you feel right at home.  The servers try to take your full order, from appetizers and drinks to dessert, all at once, so they keep the disruptions during the film to a minimum. The menus are full of American fare, including burgers and salads to flatbreads and seafood dishes, all served on bamboo plates that eliminate clinking during the film.  We tried a lot of food, starting with the Veggie Triple Feature ($7.99) that included jicama, pizza strips, celery and carrot sticks served with hummus and ranch. It was a huge appetizer and really tasty, and I loved that it was such a healthy option.  We also ordered the Double Cheese Batons ($7.99), mozzarella sticks topped with parmesan cheese. They were also yummy and a big portion.  I had to order the Bistro Mac and Cheese ($10.99) for my entree. I left off the bacon and chicken, and I loved the creaminess of the sauce and the abundance of pasta. It was served with a really great pretzel breadstick, which I thought was a delicious unique touch. I would recommend getting this, for sure.  And for dessert, we ordered New York Cheesecake ($6.49). I have to say, for a casual dining menu, both my guest and I freaking loved this cheesecake. It was really soft and creamy, and the strawberries were a perfect accompaniment.  I was really impressed with how concerned the wait staff was with making your movie experience enjoyable. Everyone who brought out our food and drinks were really careful not to disturb us, and they were impressive as servers in that they were very knowledgeable about the menu and were accurate with everything. They also spaced out all the courses expertly, preventing you from getting your entree while you're still working on your appetizer. They'll usually drop the check about an hour into the movie, but you can still add on whatever you want. Altogether, it was just a really pleasant and comfortable experience.  Tickets for movies range from $6-$15, and prices depend on the film and the theater you see it in. Even if you don't want to eat a full meal there, I think it's great to have the option to drink alcohol while you're watching a movie. For more information, log on to www.amctheatres.com/Esplanade."}
{"text":"This theater doesn't have any difference than other comfy theaters. I don't watch movie at random theaters that make me sit uncomfortably for hours anyway. I mean everything here is great. The servers do their job well. I just noticed that some people don't know where to park. There is a parking garage and the entrance is from behind of the building. 4 hours free if you validate the ticket at the theater.  & to people who order food here and complain, Just get drinks! It's A movie theater, you are watching a movie. Get food after or before. If you are hungry, get popcorn without butters. It's Biltmore, there are so many great restaurants around the theater why wouldn't you just enjoy watching movie with drinks and then grab food after?"}
{"text":"Food is insanely good. Would have never expected it at a movie theatre. Have been here a half dozen times, tried different things every time, all amazing.   Fork and Screen is nice but the Cinema Suites are fantastic. So comfy and can recline.   Service has always been great! Can go wrong with dinner and a movie all at the same time.  Oh.......and try the waffle dessert. It is to die for :) Bon Apetit"}
{"text":"If you are going to remodel half of your theatre, warn people about how awful the other half is. The seats are unbearable to sit through a whole movie. Also, don't order drinks here, they are ridiculously expensive with no alcohol."}
{"text":"**Update:  Went again, and tried the Fork & Screen. The seats are SO comfortable, and worth the extra money!   The people were very friendly, and helpful. Definitely made up for the discrepancies on the past! Added a star! :)   The theatre itself is great! Comfy seating, and who wouldn't like their food delivered to them during the movie!  The food is good - it is rather pricey, but everything I've ordered has been great! The two different pasta bowls (one chicken and one shrimp) are GREAT!! You could also just order drinks and popcorn/candy to keep the bill low.  The first two times I went there the staff was VERY nice. They greeted you at the door and offered to help find your seat. The last two times I've been, the service was dreadful! I'm not sure what changed!   The first time our waitress was fairly rude and I'm pretty sure they did not get our order in. We were quite a ways into our movie (and everyone else had been served) before our food came - and we had to ask our waitress who assured us it was on it's way (it arrived 15 minutes after that!)  Our visit today was the worst! We bought tickets online so we could pick our seats, and we arrived 40 minutes early. We were in our seats 30 minutes before the movie started, and we weren't even offered drinks until 2 minutes before the movie started. Many other people were seated and served, while we waited. We both pushed our buttons, and nothing. The waitress was nice when she came to take our order, but we were pretty put off at that point. It's a real pain to get there so early and be completely ignored! And there were lots of servers just standing around outside which was annoying!   It has such good potential, and was great the first couple of times, but seems to have really gone downhill. I hope they get better servers and turn the place back around! We're going to try one of the other dine-in theaters next!"}
{"text":"This theater is comfortable, you can pre-reserve your seats, it has fair prices and great food!   I've been going here for years, it is the only theater I will go to. There were a couple bad years where the service was awful, I definitely am going to this place FAR less because of that but that last few times I have went the service has been awesome and the food is great.   AMC has done quite a bit to improve after a couple bad years."}
{"text":"Oh my God, the service is horrible. As I write this, I have been here 20 minutes in a half-filled theatre, and no waiter. I was refused service at the bar, not because I was underaged, but because I was buying a drink for my wife and me, I was supposed to bring her ID along.  Do yourself a favor: drive the extra miles to iPic Theaters. Better facilities, better service."}
{"text":"Came to see a movie and didn't expect things to be so dirty.  Pretty disappointed.  Wet dirty towels, trash on the ground, and everything is sticky and greasy.  Don't they clean up?"}
{"text":"I visited AMC Dine in Movie Theater 2.26.17 and I was disappointed to see that the Quality of service here has greatly diminished and now it's just a ratchet hole.  For starters;  the movie theater's  restrooms are downright filthy stinky truck stops.  It's like a week worth of customers kicked in the restroom door from the hallway entrance and relieved themselves.   The Cinema seat dining Menus are covered in a grey thrush-ey film like someone has been licking all over them.  Flatware is dirty and the ketchup bottles have questionable contents.  (I see an infection control issue on the horizon). My neighbor's reclining seat didn't work.  Food Service is also delayed or misaligned   The theater use to employ workers with the same mentality or professionalism as an Apple Store employee.  Now it's like they recruit staff from the nearest whack Church's Chicken who simply don't care about their job.  They need service dogs to help guide them to bring food back to the correct customer.  My strawberry Fanta refill was given to the wrong person 3 spaces away from me (and the stranger actually accepted my old glass -yuck!!).  Don't waste your date night money here.   In the alternative, Invest in a big comfy couch,  microwave popcorn  and watch Netflix at home."}
{"text":"Since experiencing dine-in theaters, watching movies isn't the same unless it's dine-in.  You don't have to necessarily order food - but what's so great is that you pretty much pay the same price you would pay at a regular movie theater, only difference is you don't have to rush and look for seats.. you already have a seat assigned to you."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to quite a few of the dinner and a movie theaters. This one was by far the biggest disappointment. The movie was great, but the food and service left something to be desired. It took about 45 minutes to get our meal and when it arrived it was cold and almost inedible. We where both sick that evening and the next morning."}
{"text":"My roomate has worked at this theater for past 3 years, and let me tell you, this is the best theater I've ever been too. I mean you get to eat great food and watch a movie in recliners! You can even order alcohol if you'd like!  Overall, this theater is super friendly, clean, great food, good quality sound and picture, and very comfortable seats."}
{"text":"nice place to watch a movie. clean and very comfortable chairs."}
{"text":"I need a date!!! The food was great BUT the service wasn't as good. I'll definitely return"}
{"text":"Beautiful environment.  Seats are comfortable.  Movies are a little more expensive but so worth it.  The negatives are the food is lackluster and expensive for how bad it is.  The popcorn is so gnarly!"}
{"text":"I saw Avengers last night and the volume was so low that I could barely hear what they were saying at certain parts. Even my friend said the same thing. I look forward to re-watching this somewhere else so I can actually hear it."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in to watch a movie while in town on vacation. We visited theater 8 and there is not a large theater and the seating is limited. This is normally a bad thing however, it makes more room for the comfortable seats and space between rows so you don't feel cramped or on top of the person next to you.  The server was polite and friendly. He got our order correct and was very quick to respond when we pressed the button. We only ordered candy, drinks, and popcorn. The popcorn is free refills and is a LARGE bucket of popcorn. The butter came in small containers so we could pour it ourselves and mix up the popcorn at the same time.   The main reason I dropped a star was the menu is loaded with items they do not have currently. The beverage menu is LOADED with all the soda choices you could ask for. However, they have NONE of them only serving Coke products currently. This is a real disappointment when you look at the menu and decide on something then told it's not available.   The other reason for the loss of a star was the seating area was cleaned. However, the little swing around table tops were left VERY wet and hard to see that when sitting down in the low lighting so I got this on my arm and shirt. I had to use my napkin to then dry off the table.  Other than those two areas of opportunity it was a good visit."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the whole dining/movie watching concept. Also the seats are very large and very comfy :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner and watch MIB III last night.  Food was okay but it was overpriced and wished they would have more of a selection.  The waitress was nice and it appeared they were adequately staffed but our order took a long time so I must assume the kitchen was not adequately staffed.  Great place to have beer and watch a movie with your significant other.  Wish they would not serve hard alchohol inside the theater to obviously intoxicated patrons drinking Patron. Seating is comfortable"}
{"text":"The only way to see a movie! Get your own seat online, have a beer and/or food while watching a movie, it's a great concept and now my new favorite way to watch a movie. The suites are the best, it's like a first class flight only a movie. If you've ever dreaded ghetto places like Christown or metro center this place is for you!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night to see The Office Party. And we were quite disappointed with the atmosphere of the theater. In theater 13, my boyfriend sat in a chair with duct tape on the seat. Our server was very nice, but he completely forgot about our food. About 30 minutes went by and everyone else got their food in the theater. I pushed the call for service button on my seat, and he brought out the food and immediately apologized. We took one bite and our food had tasted like it was sitting out for a long time and was cold. We asked the manager to take it back and she promised to take half of it off of our bill. I was charged otherwise because the server asked for my credit card before the meal. I am awaiting to receive a refund. I honestly wouldn't recommend this theater. I feel the prices of their food is a little outrageous."}
{"text":"I don't know what I was expecting as far as food goes, but for the prices I would have expected better than warm not hot food served.  I would have expected made to order, not food that reached my seats before our drinks.  I had to flag our server down to even get our drinks.  He told me they come from a different area so they would be right out.  Every other drink in the theater that was ordered after our food arrived got to the seats before I even flagged our server down.  So with mediocre food and crappy service I think going the traditional rout of a restaurant then a Harkins is the way to go.  Good luck AMC hope it gets better."}
{"text":"While the theater is nice and their Minute Maid Smoothies are amazing, their food is a disappointment. I ordered chicken strips and ended up getting something that tasted like it was microwaved from McDonalds. C'mon. At least hire some real chefs."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have our first alone date night since our baby and thought this would be a great idea the movie we chose was Spider-Man everything was great however the waitress Ashlyn was a bit awkward and not very on top of things I asked for a sprite refill for my husband and a brownie sundae the sundae was pretty quick to come however the sprite took longer than the sundae it took around 10 for someone to actually bring it. And at the end of our meal she brought our check after only taking our order and never checking in on us wrote on our bill how much we should tip and please with arrows because we are not bad tippers and we know that 20% is the best tip amount to give we have her $10 however we also know how to appreciate good service and hers was not good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try the AMC Dine in for our Friday nite date nite and it was an awesome experience.   The staff was so friendly and fast.  The food was very good.  We enjoyed our nite"}
{"text":"Had a great experience their,very pleasant staff . Free parking in a covered garage as long as you get your ticket validated. Great drink menu and great food selection, had a prime rib burger was the size of a whopper but twice as thick was done just right . Sara was our server she really made the experience greatwas worth the money great food good beverage menu and awesome service ooh the movie was good too."}
{"text":"I went here on November 19th, about 9 o'clock at night. The movie experience was great, the service was great, but the food itself was terrible. I ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl and, I kid you not, the chicken was ice cold, as if it was simply taken out of the fridge and put on top of some (barely) warm rice without any attempt to cook or heat it. I really don't want to go back, but if I do, I think I'll skip the meal."}
{"text":"I loved it here the chairs are sooooooo cozy! They recline and all!!! ahhhhhhhh!!!! The food is pretty decent and the wait staff are like ninjas they just show up at the right time.   If I had to have a downside it's that the table in the theatre is slightly awkward and I say that looking for something wrong.   The decor is nice love the bar that greats you when you walk in. It is really a great place total bonus if your looking for a date but don't wanna invest the time for dinner and a movie (hey it's like that sometimes lol)!"}
{"text":"Just returned from Deadpool 2. I am absolutely finished with this AMC movie theater. Running time for the film was 111mins (under two hours) and we were in there almost three hours. I guess I knew someone was going to cross this line and, to no surprise, it was the brain trust at AMC who decided, \"Hey, people won't mind ANOTHER 15 minutes of advertising! They know how lucky they are in to be in our overpriced theater that they'll wait as long as we make them!\" Can you imagine going to your doctor's appointment and having to sit through half an hour of pharmaceutical commercials before even being brought back to the exam room? How about sitting down at a restaurant and being obligated to watch 30 minutes of ads before the waitress could even put in your order? This is the new normal at AMC.   Where irony clearly isn't lost on AMC, there was even a running 'gag' between all the commercials/trailers where the Grinch is popping in after each one saying, \"Just start the movie already!\" Right -- because paying a company for a ticket to a 7:30PM film that won't even be projected until 8:00PM makes us all Grinches. Well, I must have been in a theater of Grinches because the audience commentary as the trailers (four of which were for nearly-identical action films) dragged on and on was laughably audible. It's obvious that everyone gets that there are going to be previews -- but AMC is entering a new era of customer disdain with their open-ended advertising offerings.   What's honestly the point of going to a place like the Esplanade anymore? Their food is overpriced Applebee's reject garbage and everything on the menu is in line with ballpark pricing. Their tickets are pricier than other theaters. An unknown chunk of YOUR time is going to be spent looking at things like Geico commercials because eroding your overpriced moviegoing experience makes AMC more money. Your time doesn't matter to them. Your enjoyment doesn't matter to them. AMC might as well be run by Comcast or Centurylink.   AMC does not take pride in its company and it is obvious that this comes from their top level executives who have made their careers out of doing exactly what you're seeing at the Esplanade -- robbing the customer of his/her experience with the sole focus of improving their margins. As a consumer, we're at least fortunate enough to have other options for dining and entertainment other than this place.  There's no way I'm ever again paying $11/seat for tickets to a film that I have no idea how late it will start while I'm held hostage for concessions at 8X markup. I was so busy finding other things to keep my attention before this film that, by the time the movie started, I was barely interested anymore. All the excitement about going to the movies had completely warn off as I had moved on to checking my favorite websites and texting friends. And by the last twenty minutes of the film, I was so sick of being in my seat and anxious to just get the hell out of there that I couldn't even enjoy the ending. Exiting the theater, I felt exhaustion like I'd just flown halfway across the country, not the pep that used to come when walking out after enjoying a popular comedy/action film.   Shame on AMC and every theater that is going to definitely follow suit. This is absurdity that you cannot predict what time a 7:30PM showing of a movie is going to start, especially considering how great the in-home experience is now. Knowing this, instead of making their experience better, AMC is just doubling down on gouging you and daring you not go to the movies. Well, challenge accepted. For the time and money wasted at AMC, I've got no problem ordering in Uber Eats and putting any of the MILLIONS of available films on my Amazon account for a few bucks to enjoy a film at home. I mean, hey, that the in-home experience is exponentially better than visiting a corporate theater is not new. But the value that once existed with the experience of going to see a film at the theater has completely vanished. Seeing a movie at AMC is more akin to a chore than anything entertaining.    Well I'm done. The less-expensive Harkins will get my Star Wars money every couple years and that's about it. Not that AMC will care much losing a guy who goes to the movies only about ten times a year. But still -- have some pride in your business. Provide an environment that doesn't actually DETRACT from the film itself, AMC.   And fix your escalator, AMC. It seems like that thing has been out of service for months. Oh wait -- why would they? Repairs cost money and they can just expect their patrons to take the stairs, right?"}
{"text":"The theatre is showing wear and tear. Seats are still comfy but they need to be replaced. Cracking and stuffing/foam showing.  Menu is pretty boring with a couple exceptions."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this theater. Assigned very nice seat, full bar and restaurant.. They had special Christmas drink and my peppermint snowball was so yummy. It tasted like peppermint and chocolate :)..Food was great too. Enjoyed my dinner.  I would love to come back here for a date."}
{"text":"Took my daughter to see The Lion King for her birthday. Harkins has summer movies for $5. AMC charges FULL PRICE... for the LION KING! Our total was $17.45. Plus the cheapest treat they have (for the birthday girl) is $5.99. Switching back to Harkins."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my last trip to the movies now that this cinema has been revamped. Gone is the concession stand and in it's place is a full bar. There are also a few tables in the lobby where patrons can have cocktails or order an entree from the menu....yup, they serve food and adult beverages.  The cinemas themselves have been revamped with wider seats and small tables in between the seats. There is waiter service to bring you food and drinks during the show along with cloth napkins and silverware. The set-up is still stadium seating and there appear to be long tables closer to the screen for larger parties as the tables further up are arranged in groups of two.  Prices are less than I expected. Three beers and Parmesan fries was $20. This is not a bargain night out, but still an enjoyable outing and this experience may compel me to go the movies more often. May not be everyone's cup of tea but I for one enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"The only seats available have a pony wall in front of them preventing you from seeing entire screen!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I will not tell you the problems I have had because for a dine in theater it's not bad. I will say how ever the staff is less than trained on restaurant style service and basically it's comparable to your idiot brother making macaroni and cheese then eating most of it while complaining you do dishes. Pros-  The coffee! It's amazingly good! The bar- drinks are great. Atmosphere is clean and nothing is broke. Cons- No silverware after you use the one given to you. Long wait times to get service. The waiter will stand and block you while watching a movie and taking the order of the person in front of you. Refills on drinks? Not happening. Dirty dishes? They sit there in the way. Go to Ipic in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I want to love this place so bad, but it won't let me. There is some good, but a little more bad. I am honestly surprised at the number of 5 stars. I have been to the Esplanade probably around 6 times, and this is what I have observed.... -The ticketing staff is always patient, helpful, and friendly - The bar- ugh. My partner and I have officially given up on the bar. They always seemed understaffed and grumpy. Maybe AMC should have service bartenders that only work the service well? I have had the same bartender the last few times there (can't remember name but her favorite movie is \"A Walk to Remember\", and she does not smile at all and is not the tiniest bit friendly. While there on Sunday, we had one round and she dropped off the ticket. I had my card sitting on it for 15 mins. (Really, 15, because we were contemplating if we had enough time to go somewhere else before the movie.) Three bartenders walked by repeatedly, not one taking my card. We tried to get eye attention but were avoided. We had to stand up and shuffle around to get the attention of one bartender who had passed us the most. In previous visits, the service was always slow, and typically unfriendly. -Servers- hit or miss, but a lot of misses. In one incident my partner ordered a beer on draft. The server said okay.  Between 15-20 mins later a different server approached us and said they didn't have that particular beer.  Welp, that would've been nice to know. A different beer was ordered. Another 20 mins passed before we got that beer, by that time we were over it and sent it back. That seems pretty typical. Drinks take as long as food. Refills can be difficult to come by. I often see servers running food to the wrong people. Last time, we saw our order whiz past us and then back out the theater. We tried flagging the server down, but it was too late. I certainly wasn't going to chase after her. It took another 3 or 4 mins to get our food. On the bright side, the servers are at least all friendly. (Especially compared to the miserable bartenders) -The atmosphere is fun, the location is ideal, and it's very clean. The theaters are spacious and comfy.  AMC has a great concept here, but they definitely have a long way to go! I am not sure if I will give this place another chance or not. Maybe just a matinee where all we want is sodas?"}
{"text":"Wow! I love the new remodel. It is so nice and clean. I am really surprised with the attention to detail. Of course, you are still watching a movie at a movie theater, but the food was good - fairly priced and they have a bar? Who knew..."}
{"text":"I liked this theater. Had a date night here this past weekend, it was my first time visiting, not his. I thought the actual ticket cost would be higher, but they were 10 bucks a piece. I liked that when I booked online, I reserved the actual seats I wanted, opposed to other theaters where you sit where there is room. Parking is kind of a nightmare, its in a garage, and there are stairs required (at least this weekend the elevator was broken)....just a warning, as of course I wore heels. The seats were nice and oversized, comfortable! We sat in the very back row on the corner seats, great seats. I think any of the higher seats would have been good though. After reviewing the menu I decided to not get any food or drinks, I though they were overpriced (I am cheap though lol). Given that this is the closest theater to me, aside from the harkins downtown, I would still come here to just see a movie. Staff was friendly, and the location is clean. Would recommend. :)"}
{"text":"My favorite movie theater in town.  $5 movies before noon, nice neighborhood and surroundings, and not too many annoying ankle-biting children.  Yes, the escalators should just be made into fixed stairs.  I've had the privilege of riding an escalator one time in dozens of trips.  The smells in the parking garage are sometimes not fun, but it smells like roses compared to the clientele at Harkins AZ Mills."}
{"text":"AMC is now a China owned company and unfortunately I would prefer to support something USA owned or local.   I switched Harkins which is Arizona owned.  I will give up a recliner any day to support locally owned businesses. Peace out AMC."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this theatre if you're not in the neighborhood.  Overall not a great movie-going experience.  1. They don't have reclining seats! I know, I know, how bougie of me.. but every  AMC I've been to recently have made the upgrade. Plus, I live by a Harkins that does, so it doesn't make sense to drive extra miles to be more uncomfortable.  2. The service is god awful! It took 10 minutes and my boyfriend leaving the theatre to track someone down before we were served.  Every employee we interacted with seemed so upset they had to be there.  Every time we asked a question, we were met with cold stares and exasperation.  3. Whereeeee is my freshly popped pop corn and root beer?  Ughhhhhh.  We all know half the movie-going experience is being able to binge eat your favorite movie theatre snacks.  The popcorn was so stale, we barely ate any, and they didn't have half the soft drinks on the menu.  What kind of theatre is this?  Ok, I originally gave this place two stars but I'm downgrading to 1.  Really no positives about this place.  Oh, and parking was $8.  Seriously, just don't come here.  Choose another theater."}
{"text":"After having tried iPic theater in Scottsdale, this was like going from a Motel 6 to the Four Seasons. WELL worth the expense. We were on the side that served alcohol, not the \"Fork and Screen\" theater.  We started off early getting there before 3pm for a 3:50 showing. Waited in line longer than I would have cared for due to a woman in front of me who had to have the staff person read every summary of every movie showing. To that woman: have some courtesy for others and read it online for yourself or on that cool iPhone you kept looking it. So I found I really waited in line for nothing since if you purchased your tickets online, you could pick them up at the kiosks along the wall. Might have been nice to have a sign conveniently so I (and the others who heard this) wouldn't have had to wait.  I got a draft beer and it was served in an iced glass. Nice. I really didn't expect a theater \"bar\" to pay that much attention to detail especially after iPic. We were supposed to be able to get our seats at 3pm but when we went in, someone was still cleaning and asked if we could wait. Not a big deal. We were in by 3:10.  Seats. Amazingly comfortable and didn't have a bar going along the back as they did in iPic. Comfortable throughout the whole movie. Our server was prompt and got us drinks right away as well as an appetizer order. That reminds me...the menu. The menu was great with far more to choose from than the 3 items or so I was given a choice of at iPic. There were server call buttons on each chair unlike the \"wave them down if you see them\" method of iPic. I used it once to order dinner and again, the server was prompt.   Food. Food was hot and very good. Nothing to complain about at all. I had the Chicken Alfredo and my wife had the Mac n Cheese. Both were fantastic and the portions were large.   They even ended the movie with a lemon-scented hot towel! Attention to detail is how you do it and they are doing it great. I purchased a loyalty card since I will be back. iPic? iPic who?"}
{"text":"Love this place. This is my movie theater of choice. Even though its a little further away, and a little more expensive, amc dine-in is the way to go.  My favorite thing to order is the veggie dipper. Its a perfect fresh nosh, and when im in the mood for a meal, I love the shrimp tacos (but sub fries, instead of chips).  I've been here a handful of times, and the cinema suites are the way to go. Fork and screen seats are a little less comfortable, but you can bring family under 21.  Their popcorn is serious....ly awesome, and i would highly recommend it if you want a delish salty snack thats 100% addicting.   We signed up for the stubs program and have gotten such a reward back, that it pays for itself 5 fold! Great investment, and definitely the way to go.  Love this place. Its a prefect combination of ipic and harkins."}
{"text":"We've seen a bunch of movies at this theater over the years, so I am surprised I haven't written a review just yet.  Most recently, we went to see  \"The Blind Side.\"  (Loved it by the way and highly recommend it).    Some of the things I like about this movie theater: *Great movie selection *Comfortable seats *Validated underground parking *Easy access to Biltmore Fashion Mall, True Food, and Houston's *Popcorn and other tasty treats *Clean bathrooms *Very good times compared to other theaters  And just a few things I've noted during my visits to this theater: -escalators not always dependable -expensive concessions -ticket prices consistent with other theaters but still on the steep side!  That being said, I'm sure I'll continue to frequent this theater - keep the customer service, movie selection, etc... coming.  Just do me a favor and keep the prices where they're at.. no need to keep raising ticket prices!  Happy viewing all!"}
{"text":"Just moving to Phoenix a week ago I didn't have any idea this was a dine in theater. I walked in and was asked for my ID. I was like \"ummm sure\" the ticket dude told me what this place was an my jaw dropped literally!  We sat in the cinema suites which all the seats are lazy boy recliner chairs! You can order anything on there dinner menu plus get any type of alcoholic beverage you desire while in the movie theater...  Will Definatly go back since I live right down the street but this is not the type of movie theater that I will go every time a decent movie comes out."}
{"text":"this made going to the movies fun again! very comfortable chairs.. spacious.. decent food. the servers were nice and courteous.  I really enjoyed going here. will definately come again!"}
{"text":"Desserts are amazing here  Get the brownie and vanilla ice cream one  Or the Oreo shake is delicious as well    I ordered chicken tenders (which are the same as their boneless wings)  The southwest wrap  Pretzel bites ( comes with cheddar cheese and honey Dijon)   Everything was alright .. wouldn't have dinner here again. Definitely coming here for dessert and movie though"}
{"text":"Our trip here Sunday was mediocre at best. As regular movie goers, let me tell you what missing. Cleanliness.. we continue to be let down with this location. Did you forget that you are in the Biltmore and you have a level of class to stick to. Our cup holders had crap in them and so did the floor by our feet. If the theatre is not ready.. do not allow entry. I rather the movie start 3-5 mins late than have a dirty experience.   Other than this issue, the food was good. The server was good, however was a little loud vocally during the show. His tone was fine before the show...during he needa to be a level or two lower..i dont want to hear him over the movie and that was the case. Also, please have the wait to bring the tab.. i felt like you didnt want me to buy more. Halfway thru the movie hes giving me the bill.. is that my sign to get the frick out?   All these issue boil down to bad management training of thier staff. The Esplanade may be a close option, but you are not the only choice anymore for a luxury experience. Step it up!"}
{"text":"had watch Ride Along with my date. Its upscale I get it but even for Upscale its ridiculously high priced. Popcorn is 8? Seriously? Skip it and order food. My shrimps were cooked to perfection. Drinks on the other hand were over priced. Next time ill try the recliners and see what the fuss is about. I really use to like Studio Movie grill until they decided to change their menu and got rid of all the good items. Never going there for sure."}
{"text":"My guy is crazy about these upscale theaters and I know why. Dinner and drinks during a movie is an excellent concept and I'm all for it.  We chose our seats online, no need to wait in line early to get those perfect seats - just order ahead. The theaters are less crowded and have leather recliner seats with tables. I was completely comfortable.  We ordered a seafood appetizer platter that included lobster. This is not your average fare, yet the prices were equal to a restaurant dinner out. I was throughly impressed with our waiter service.  I went for the Mango Margarita, while my guy stuck to beer. We decided to switch up our second round and ordered Rum Punch drinks. All in all, these were great drinks that I would have loved anywhere...but in a movie, awesome!  So now that I've been to these fancy Dinner Movie theaters, I am really hoping they will open one up close to home."}
{"text":"This place was so disgustingly dirty and ghetto.  All of the seats had food splattered on them, the trays were sticky and the seats that were ripped and covered with tape. Great idea but terrible follow through.  Usually go to the arrowhead AMC and it is always clean.  I would stay away from the esplanade location if you don't want food stuck on your clothes."}
{"text":"My husband, kids and I feel this is an absolute staple in our romantic date nights as well as our fun family nights.  Parking is never an issue as there is a three or four story garage, you receive a pass that gets validated for free inside since you are partaking in a movie.   Once inside, or online beforehand, not only do you have a choice in movies and times, you also get to choose if you want to be a \"Cinema Suites\" patron or a \"Fork and Spoon \" patron.  In the Cinema Suites, thee are absolutely no children under 21, even if they are are there with you, it was last minute, no one can watch the , bah , blah , blah- no getting in!.  For singles, this is a glorious gift from the heavens, no chance of crazy little kids running around everywhere, making noises, etc.  For parents, this kind of sucks if there's a perfect showtime and it's a movie that everyone wants to see, especially when you have older children.  The nice thing is , it kind of forces parents to have a date night sans kids.  Another added bonus a  Now once you are in your seat, time to feast.  This food is phenomenal considering it is movie theater food. There's a good selection of appetizers:I recommend the parmesan fries, bread basket, veggie trio, and the hot wings.  There's a lot of sandwiches, I recommend: The Prime Rib Dipper(?), The Lime Chicken Griller (?), The Turkey Sandwich, Now onto the Pizzeta's! Yumm.  Try them all.  The only negative report i Have on the  Esplanade;s Menu are the \"Million Dollar Milkshakes\"  I've had mine remade only to have to have have same conclusion;it tastes like it was made with water, not milk.   Overall, the customer service, the attentiveness of our server and"}
{"text":"Very comfortable seats , perfect place to dine in and movie Sunday evenings !!! Shrimp tacos is a killer !!!! Must try 100%"}
{"text":"I love this theater.  I love that you get to reserve your own seat in advance.  No more rushing to the theater hoping to find a good seat.  I also love that you have a choice of a 21 or above only theater or general theater.  I do have to say that even in the general theater I have yet to have seen a child or baby.  It's been adults only so far.  The food and service is good.  At one screening the film start was delayed by 15 minutes and without complaint from anyone the manager came and gave everyone in the theater a pass to come back just for waiting.  Very good customer service."}
{"text":"You can't really beat this theater for a great movie experience.  Here's what you need to know:  1.  You park in the back (I believe its off of 24th st).  Get a ticket from the parking garage and then have it validated before you leave.  The parking is free! 2.  If you exit the parking garage on the 1st floor, you need to take the escalator up to the second level.  This threw me off the first time. 3.  You can purchase your ticket and reserve your seat head of time!  This is great for opening weekends. 4.  There is a full menu and drink list.  I'm still a sucker for the popcorn though! 5.  Saturday afternoons are more inexpensive than evening shows - something to keep in mind if you are on a budget! 6.  The seats are big & comfy and have a little side table for your food drinks!"}
{"text":"My favorite theater I've been to since moving here. Super comfortable chairs, good food options, and reasonably priced all around.   They validate parking, too!"}
{"text":"A little hard to get to. The place is a tiny bit run down. Escalator up to the theatre has been broken the last two times I was there.  Reclining chairs are great. Most comfortable seating you can get for watching a movie. Not sure which theaters have them here, but at least some here do.  Service is meh - but what can you really expect for dine-in theatre.  The burger is actually quite good - I would recommend it. The frys came out cold, but, had they been warm, would have been good.  Take note. Some of their theatres are adults only, but it is not clear on the website which ones."}

{"text":"Just moved back to the valley and was anxious to go see Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates. Initially was going to go to Harkins at Fashion Square but after looking at the prices for regular seats of $14 a piece for the earliest show I was happy to find that the movie was also playing here.  Pros Great ticket prices, adult matinee tickets were $8 a piece which included convenience fee for purchasing on line Large recliners that fully recline with tables that you can move when you're done eating  Friendly staff Parking garage with 4 hour parking validation with purchase of movie ticket Large selection of food items (we didn't eat anything as we just came from breakfast)  Cons I believe the theatre also has some viewing rooms with regular seats so make sure that when you are looking if you want the recliners that you check carefully The partition walls between the rows are a little high so you miss some of the bottom of the screen  Overall I give 4 stars and am looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Nice seats...pricey over - fluffed menu. Truffle fries? Really?  Got the chicken fingers with thai sauce...was just ok...next time I'll just go for the booze!!"}
{"text":"Our first attempt to see a movie here was an epic fail on my part. Who'd a thunk you have to purchase your tickets in advance which allows you to pick your own cushy seats? What a nifty- brilliant idea, right?  I was like, drop me off here and I'll go buy the tickets while you park the car and he was like, you didn't pre-purchase our tickets (white eye stare)? And I was like, seriously, who pre-buys tickets on a Friday night as I exit the almost stopped car?  I high tail it to the counter praying to god and all the saints that there are two fantastic seats available. So I get to the ticket counter ever so confident still thinking I can score us some fantastic seats to a movie during opening week. But got the disingenuous - sorry all sold out instead. I politely but desperately asked her to \"check again,' nope sorry. Maybe someone's cancelled?\" She was like, no, sorry, still sold out. He shows up - almost out of breath from his post park jog. So, where are the tickets? And I was like...Well, Um, hmmm...and he was like,, Yeah... Pre-Purchase Tickets (white eye stare)!   So lesson learn, I pre-purchased our tickets to our follow-up movie and it was a fun experience. Great seats, good food, a couple rounds of cocktails and most importantly, NO CRYING BABIES!   Funny thing, we discovered the stow away food trays half way through the movie and we were so excited.   They even have movies...IN 3D.  We'll go again."}
{"text":"Date night, friend night, this is how we should always watch movies! Very comfortable seats, the food is okay.m but there is a lot of choices. You can buy your seats online to avoid the line."}
{"text":"Still my favorite place in the Phoenix metro to see a movie. The theater is upstairs and does validate parking but that's not the draw for me. I love being able to reserve my seats ahead of time and go to shows that aren't filled with the little humans that can disrupt the movie going experience.   The seats are plush even in the \"fork and screen\" halls and the \"cinema suites\" are like overstuffed electric reclining couch chairs. For those who are interested in some libations they have you covered here! Literally with a push of a button. There is a nice lounge out front where you can eat out in a more well lit area if you prefer that to your seat during the movie.   Overall I can't think of a single reason to go somewhere else unless you are looking for a \"dollar theater\" experience... this place provides great customer service, food, and drinks at a reasonable price if you're looking for a date night upgrade."}
{"text":"VIP Theater the only thing better is iPic  I got to go here on the 12th for the first time while visiting for business.  It was pretty nice. Reserve your seat to any movie in advance and the seats are really comfortable.  The rooms are much bigger than iPic so I like the stadium seating you get with a lazy boy leather seat. I was disappointed they didn't recline but I did like that you could call your waiter anytime where as iPic you have to wait till they come back.   It's cheaper than iPic for sure.  Over all I had a good experience. It was easy and enjoyable.   The best thing about any VIP theater is the ability to pick your seat and get your tickets in advance so even if it's a popular sold out movie,  you know your not only going and when but you also know where you are sitting instead of hoping it's not sold out and hoping you get a good seat. Can't beat that, then to top it off really comfy seats and a great experience. No more missing the movie to run to refill your drink or get more popcorn etc...   If you haven't tried a VIP Movie Theater then you've got to experience it at least once!"}
{"text":"Clean and comfortable. Eat before you come though as a popcorn with drink can be almost many! Nice staff though."}
{"text":"Came for a 2nd time! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE! Ordered 3 drinks durning the previews, received them 45 minutes later. The comped the overpriced stale popcorn, so that was....a try. iPic is still the place, but this place gets 1 more shot from me. Sink or swim, its up to them......"}
{"text":"We saw the new Star Wars movie Solo this past weekend. We were in the 21 and up reclining theater which is absolutely divine. My husband and I split an appetizer platter they have changed their menu but it still fairly decent. Mixed drinks pricey not necessarily worth the price in my opinion. But they are tasty for what they are. It's very nice having a reclining chair and some great food and a cold beer and to enjoy your favorite movie. very spacious comfortable chairs and a lot of foot room. I'm 6ft and husband is 6'4\".  We're so spoiled we keep renewing our AMC stubs card and continuing to go to this particular theater. We almost don't like going to a regular theater now."}
{"text":"Looking for a dinner and a movie?  Check out AMC Dine-in Theatres!  Food is good, seats are comfortable and the service is friendly and timely.   Definitely a good choice for a present night out."}
{"text":"Well, If you had asked me six months ago, I would have given 5 stars - great food and great theaters.  Now, for whatever reason, they have changed the menu that is barely even worth ordering from, and so my friends and I have been REALLY disappointed the last two times.  Plus, my tray was broken and although I asked for extra butter both times, I had to push the damn button again, get interrupted during the movie to ask for extra butter....the flatbread pizza is gone, the popcorn shrimp is gone, the yummy cheese sticks are gone....replaced by food that is really hard and messy to eat in the dark (burger with everything on it???) - I got the fries and even THOSE have been replaced from yummy thin cut fries to soggy thick cut fries.  They unbelievable deserts have been replaced by mediocre shakes and ...wait for it...DONUTS.  That's it.  No other choices.    Other than the reclining seats, now there is no incentive to go back."}
{"text":"OMG.. I LOVE what you've done with this place. Saw Twilight - Breaking Dawn here (dont judge me). Service was excellent, food was excellent. Seats were comfy.. love that there is reserved seating...I dont know why you would go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"I love coming here for the atmosphere and the comfy reclining seats. However, way too expensive for real poor food. Would not recommend anything on the menu or their over priced wine. Stock up before you go!"}
{"text":"I'm weird & picky about movies, & I realize this. We also go to the movies maybe once every 2 years, only to something we really want to see in theaters (Boyhood this time around), & I usually prefer renting at home. So I find having people walk around and serve you, and eating something savory while watching the screen, kind of strange, but I can see how many human units would like this experience.  That said I love being able to reserve seats, makes the experience so much better. I check times a few days in advance, grab the prime seats at a movie I'm excited about, and show up as the previews are rolling out worry free. This time around we actually had to get the usher to kick people out of our prime seats to take theirs way up front, very satisfying!  Never experienced anything but Fork & Screen, but this has been good. I'm not a fan of the food they serve, and everything seems pretty expensive ($5 for a soda), but I only get popcorn & soda, and save my appetite for the real food in the area afterward. Movie ticket online was pricey but comparable to modern rates (around $12 each). Service has always been well organized & pleasant, they try to do all the distracting delivery & bill paying during previews & end, but you can order something during the movie if you want. The garage setup was strangely confusing, we took a different entrance & ended up on a lower level, but this worked out to not really be an issue, and they validate with an easy to use card machine-just remember to bring your parking ticket upstairs. So a good experience all around, will check up on it in another 2 years."}
{"text":"Chicken fajita wrap was a nice lighter side item to eat tonight.  I left the salsa alone, as it reminded me of salsa that I ate in Minnesota, catsup with a difference.  This theater makes movies better."}
{"text":"I love the esplanade for many reasons. First of all, if you go to a movie before noon the tickets are 6 dollars. That is quite the deal for the amazing service and atmosphere they offer. The seats are as comfortable as they get and the regular priced tickets are still only 12 dollars. The food is not phenomenal but it is good if you are just looking for something to munch on during your movie. I would recommend this place to anyone. I don't think I can go back to a regular theater!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had with AMC. The server was slow and rude! Passed by my friends and me several times before acknowledging our call light. Then she \"had to do the math\" for 7 minutes to figure out that we were 21+ for alcoholic drinks. Let's start on the food and drinks. My friend ordered an alcoholic lemonade that included more than what the menu said would be in it RETURN! Then the food comes. My shrimp tacos tasted literally like a**! I was sitting in the middle of the movie spitting out the food and gagging on what was still in my mouth. I was so upset I left out and took the food to the supervisor. The best she could do was remove the items from my tab. No apology, no I'll look into it, etc. there was a lady who worked there as well who walked up and was more sincere than the supervisor. My friend then ordered a shrimp salad. It tasted like the tacos I had so either the shrimp were bad or the vegetables were not cleaned. My friend went with me to complain and after she got her salad she did not feel comfortable asking to send it back and ended up paying for it. I'm not a picky eater (I eat McDonald's) so I mean it was just a terrible experience. I will never return to the dine in again!"}
{"text":"This theatre has gone down-hill quick. Our latest experience was one of the worst. Here's their issues. The movies are starting later and later. The advertised start time was 5:45pm yesterday. They ran commercials until almost 6pm (not coming attractions, but just ads). By the time the movie previews were over it was 6:12pm! Service has gotten progressively worst. They don't greet you at your seats anymore and are super slow to respond to the seat button. The staff (although nice enough) act like they hate their job. Bathrooms are consistently dirty with paper towels all over the floor (the men's room is always freezing with cold air blowing hard from the vents). The menus were sticky and some were missing near our seat. I stopped getting food because of the price increases and inconsistent quality. I only go there now because it's close to home and I was given AMC gift cards (when those run out, I'm done).  I much prefer to make the trek to Harkins Camelview at Fashion Square in Scottsdale, who run a clean, friendly and classy operation!"}
{"text":"One of the coolest places to watch a movie in comfort. Full reclining chairs and the on call food service is a huge plus. The only downside is if you're shorter (like I am), the seats sit too low and the divider walls get in the way of the bottom quarter of the screen. No way to adjust seat height so my wife and I were kind of stuck.  Your best bet if you're shorter is to grab one of the side seats (you have to reserve seats) that allow you to see the screen at a bit of an angle to avoid the divider wall.  Overall a good experience with the only thing keeping this place from getting a 5 star rating from me was the lack of height adjustment :)."}
{"text":"Love this experience! It was so relaxing and the food was really yummy, I'd recommend ordering something easy like finger foods (my fiancé and I got the chicken fingers and fries meal) because it's dark and hard to see when you're eating. The chairs are cozy and spaced out so you have privacy, I loved that! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the wall in front of the seats made it a little hard to see all of the movie screen. But overall I love this theater and we will be going back for a date night again soon for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great movie and service!!! The reason for the 2 stars is the  4 things I wanted to order I could not as 2 of them they ran out of and the other 2 I could not order because their oven went down and due to the time of year there is no one who is able to come and repair it. ;( very bad for customers wanting a lite treat and also loss of business for your company."}
{"text":"We come here maybe once a month or so for a date night. It can be quite expensive to eat here but the food is well worth it! If your looking for something on the lighter side the quinoa bowl is very healthy. I was Very excited to see an Oreo milkshake made it onto the new menu!   Though be sure to look for the 21+ mentioned in the theatre description so you get the reclining seats!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, all smiles. This was my first time to a dine in movie so I didn't know what to expect. I'm also new to the area so the location of it and where to park so a bit tricky.  The sitting of the theater itself wasn't the cleanest, crumbs and wrap we're still in the seats, and that's the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars.  Food is average, think Applebee's. They seem to bring the food out as it was available, meaning, we got the main course before the appetizer and drinks. And the desert came before the drinks. I didn't mind personally but I understand how other people can be bother by this. The food was also lukewarm.  I would come here again but maybe just order snacks and not expect a full meal, although the portion size was very filling."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking out the hype of a dine in theatre,  however this has to be the most miserable experience I've eve had in 30+ years of going to the theatre to see a movie. The seats are absolutely uncomfortable and torn up and needs recovered. The food tastes microwaved and the soda was flat and clearly prepoured because the ice was already melting. Also, I didn't love eating in the dark or all the strange smells from burgers to Brussel sprouts and add milkshakes and then popcorn...ugh!  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars was the screen was a good size and the sound quality. This place was def disappoints. I will stick with Harkins."}
{"text":"I am beyond disgusted with this theater. Until last night it was my favorite one in Phoenix. I lost my keys while watching a late show. When I got to my car in the very hot parking garage I realized I had set my keys down Inside the theater and needed to go get them. When I walked back in to ask them if anybody turned a set of keys in. They said no, without even checking. So I made my way back to the theater to look for them. They of course weren't there. Knowing full well I had them in the theater, I asked the man at the ticket counter to please get on the walkie and ask any of his co workers. He rudely refused and stated they didn't have them. At this point I am very upset as I know they were there.  I attempt to go look again in the theater when I am cornered by two more employees who tell me I need to leave, my belongings aren't their responsibility and they don't have them. ( all in disgustingly rude tone) I am in tears at this point as I know they are here and they refuse to look. 1 hour later (now 10:30) pm I am forced to call a Lyft to take me home where I am meeting a locksmith ( my apartment key was also in them). I am charged 150 dollars for the door to be unlocked.  Fast forward to today, I go back in and ask a new person at the ticket counter if they have my keys. Immediately he says no. I lie and say. I spoke to someone in the phone last night who said they're here. He calls the manager and the manager also says no. All the while NOBDOY WILL EVEN LOOK FOR THE DAMN KEYS!!  Five minutes later a girl walks out with my keys in her hand.  Big surprise my keys were there the entire time and these worthless \"human beings\" couldn't be bothered to just locate them. Now I'm stuck with plenty of bills while they don't give two shits. Screw that."}
{"text":"The new dine-in experience was pretty good. The seats in the \"fork and screen\" theaters are nice, though it seems like they are going to start to squeak, as they are more like rocking chairs than recliners. The seating is reserved, which I actually like. But be careful if you have a party of more than four people -- most rows of seats are only four across. I recommend any additional people sit in the row behind the main party, as the aisles are extremely wide. I took a peek at the \"cinema suites\" theaters which look a bit more comfortable, but I didn't get to try it. Note that each movie is usually shown in only one type of theater layout, so you won't have a choice of the type of theater you get.  The food was merely ok, as other reviewers said, on-par with a low-end chain restaurant. Most disappointing was the chicken strips, which were McNugget-like blobs of ground up chicken in a tasteless coating. And like McNuggets, there were weird gross pieces here and there. Not what I expect for $12."}
{"text":"The wait staff in the lobby was slow and the theater didn't get cleaned until minutes before the start of the movie."}
{"text":"My new go-to theater when I need to lounge and relax while watching a movie in public. I had ordered and paid for our tickets online so there was no waiting while I got our tickets from the machine. We were in theater 3 to watch Interstellar. That's a long movie, but I didn't even notice thanks to the comfortably padded reclining leather seats. No one else sat in our row (and only 5 people total in the theater) so we had privacy...and quiet.  The whole experience was so comfortable and positive that I know I'll be back. I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos: Two seasoned beef carne asada tacos with savory applewood-smoked bacon, corn salsa, pico de gallo and a cool avocado-lime crema wrapped in double-layered corn tortillas. Served with fresh tortilla chips and salsa. The pico de gallo was good. I can't believe I ate the whole thing."}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that this theatre is close to home, it is not as packed and you feel like you are VIP. They don't have the best food in town, but it's not bad and the concept of people serving you while you watch a movie is pretty cool.  They also offer alcoholic drinks so that is a major plus.  You definitely have lots of leg room and you can snuggle up with your honey because the armrest goes up.  You pay $2-3 more than an average movie ticket, but you sometimes gotta live the high life for a change so spend that extra $6 for you and a date, order her an alcoholic drink, put up that armrest, and start manuevering your arm over her neck, and watch the movie.  Hopefully, your arm doesn't get a cramp from leaving it in that position for too long.  Afterwards, don't forget to validate your parking ticket and hopefully, you end the night with a nice smooch.    Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Won't waste my time coming back here. With nobody around on a Sunday night, the 9:30pm showing of a movie nearly empty, we were refused tickets because I didn't have my ID to prove I was over 21. Really? I'm frickin' old enough to be your mother, kid. Was told we could see another movie on the forks side. For $30? No, thanks. AMC MAJOR FAIL! I'll just spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Summary: I am consistently underwhelmed here. For the price, it should be so much better.  The concept is wonderful! And I always have a good time when I go, but the food is only so-so, often cold by the time it gets to my seat, the service is hit or miss, depending on what time and day it is, and it is impossible to get someone on the phone when calling in. Make sure to get reservations a week or so in advance for weekend shows.  Food: I have gotten the tenderloin tips a few times, and sometimes they are good, and sometimes they are too salty and the meat is poor quality. The broccoli is delicious though! When I got the fettuccine alfredo with chicken, noodles were clumped together and the sauce was lacking something.  Very bland.  Anything fried comes out cold, including fish or fries.  Salads are okay, heavy on the sauce though.  Popcorn is unlimited, but when they are busy it takes a long time to get refills.  Same with soda.  On a particular day, I had bought tickets ahead of time, and needed to change them. I got stuck in this awful loop of automated voices kicking me back and forth from their store to the 800 number over, and over, and over again. It was awful.  I spent 20 mins trying to find some sort of corporate number or something and eventually gave up.  Eventually i found a number for corporate, and they informed me that they don't really have the man power to have someone assigned to the phones at the stores. When I am paying $50 for a movie and dinner for one person, they should have the funds for this.  On a particular night where my food didn't come, then it was wrong, and the staff was unsympathetic to my plight, I decided I was done with the theatre.  Then they sent me a survey asking how they did. I filled it out honestly. I received an email with a phone number to the store's manager, so I called.  Guess who answered? That same automated bs loop! I was pissed.  So I wrote Mr. Garcia (the manager handling this) and told him exactly what I thought and that I couldn't call to give him the feedback he wanted.  When he called me back a week later, he seemed stoned or lazy or something. He was passive and unprofessional.  He said he sent me passes for a free show and I never received them.  That was 2 months ago.  So, in conclusion, I do not go here any more."}
{"text":"I really had a bad experience at this location tonight, not only I am not satisfied with the slow service where my popcorn and Coke took half an hour to get to us and worst part is I got charged for the order(cheesecake) I didn't even eat at all after waiting for another half an hour to get our refill for popcorn and Coke and we waited for another 10 minutes for the check this is pretty unacceptable as I am regular customer to this location and what make more worst is that I didn't get $5 off my Tuesday tickets where I had my stub premier card with me and I didn't get the discount and front desk told me to call the ticketing services because they have nothing to do with it which makes me more angry and upset for this bad service tonight on top of that I had a shitty day which is why I Wanna relax and watch movie tonight and it just adds up to my bad day."}
{"text":"As a movie theater, 5-stars. The service is excellent (in Cinema Suites, in Fork & Screen not really). The seats are amazing in Cinema Suites. I also LOVE the assigned seating aspect.  The food is ok... sweets and milkshakes and candy stuff is much better than normal food. The chicken fingers I had, or wings or whatever, were kinda gross.  I also love the \"age limit\" of the theater. If your under 18, you HAVE to be accompanied by an adult. Makes for a much quieter and enjoyable experience.  I also love that there is a FULL bar up front. Beer and a movie - can't pass it up."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and customer service. The bartenders are awesome and made my husband and I few really good cocktails while we waited to go in the theater. However, the food is pretty mediocre. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and would return."}
{"text":"We had fun and the food was good. Sat at the very top most of the seats are well positioned. Do not chose any spot near the stairs as the view is blocked be stair rail. Also to much foot traffic is this area"}
{"text":"Great movie house!!  I love my movies and nothing is better than being able to lay back in the CINEMA SUITES ordering dinner while you watch a good movie. The service was solid. All servers have always been really helpful and polite.   The food options on the menu remind me of and Applebee's menu. Try the fire burger! Also the parm fries are solid!   The only downside is when the bill comes. Usually they bring the bill towards the middle end of the movie which is kind of awkward because usually by that time something important is happening in the movie. Other than that its a great place to take a date!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful idea to get food and drinks while I watch a movie. If you have not been here then you have to go at least once. I went and watched the hunger games catching fire. The waiter was excellent in getting me what I wanted and didn't bug me through the whole movie, just the boring parts. :)   The chairs were comfortable and roomy. I got to choose where I sat. The place was very clean and inviting. Great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Now that I have experienced the AMC Dine-in Theatre, movie going will never be the same!  I recently saw Gravity 3D in a Cinema Suite, and can say it will be hard to go back to a 'regular' theater:   - Cinema Suites are 21 and over - no little kids talking, crying or kicking my seat!   - Assigned seats - huge, comfortable reclining chairs even more cushy than my living room furniture.     - Full drink menu - gleefully drinking beer, I felt almost like we were breaking some sort of rule.  Perhaps it was flashbacks to sneaking drinks in to the movies long ago?  :)   - Food choices - while not the most extensive or fancy menu, it was pretty cool to have Mac n Cheese at a movie.  And it was Good!  The Bistro Mac n Cheese was a generous portion of cheesy pasta with topped with nicely seasoned chicken breast.   So large I couldn't finish it (and I certainly tried!).  Yes, it costs more than a typical movie theater, but it is so very worth it!"}
{"text":"I love how this theatre is close to everything, but you can always find a parking spot and the theatre is never crowded. I just wish they (and all other movie theatres) would show movies at 8pm instead of 7 and 9."}
{"text":"I like coming here for the alcohol and movie experience.  The seats are comfortable, but the dining while watching can be a bit distracting.   I suggest sticking with basics when it comes to the food. They make a decent quesadilla, but it's pretty hard to mess one up. Avoid the shrimp!  If you like strong mixed drinks then this is the place to go, otherwise stick with beer.   And, if you have superman ears, try to avoid listening in on server and bartender conversations.  I overheard a couple racial comments and it got me heated.  Those kinds of conversation shouldn't take place anywhere around where customers can hear."}
{"text":"We went to see Pete's Dragon today.  As far as the movie itself goes, it was great.  The sound is great as well as the picture.  The rest of the experience, however, was not good.  Our seats, trays, and armrests were sticky and dirty.  The cupholders still had trash stuffed in them.  The armrests are worn out and showing the inside cushioning which is very uncomfortable.  We got there hungry so we (myself, husband and 2 kids) ordered food.  It took a long time to get it, and it was cold when it finally arrived.  My husband specifically asked for sauce on the side for his tots and it came with sauce on it anyway.  I ordered the nachos and they were cold and soggy.  Even my Coke was not good.  My kids got the macaroni and cheese and it was cold and congealed.  My husband and I went to a movie a week ago and ordered the pretzels and cheese, and the cheese was cold and congealed (gross).   We love that we can come and have our seats reserved, but lately it hasn't been a great experience.  This is not the first time the food and service has been bad but this time compelled me to finally write a review in hopes of getting this venue back to its glory days when it first opened and was soooooo nice.  In the meantime we will be looking elsewhere for our movies."}
{"text":"Sadly not the best experience. Weird situation with parking and no signs really directing you where to go. The escalator was broken and along with another couple we found the elevator and made our way to the theater. I love AMC especially the reclining chairs but we were in that dine in regular theater. Food was horrible!  Tasted like it all came from expired can. Hubby had gourmet Mac and cheese and I had potato skins. How can you mess that up. Wait Service soooo slow even blocked the screen ahead of us with taking orders. Popcorn bucket probably only good thing except later my stomach hated that too. Expensive movie date. Think I will stick with my favorite AMC and ditch this one."}
{"text":"This was my go to theather when I lived in Phoenix and I was up in the area Saturday so decided to go to a movie.  I was so disappointed, I was in #14, and the chairs hardly rock and I tried several in my row since they were not taken and they were either broken or all torn up. I use to tell all my friends and family how I love going to this movie theather, but I WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT ANYMORE.  Even as I left I heard other people complain.  I tried not to give this place any stars but it would not let me continue without leaving at least one star. NO STARS FOR THIS THEATER."}
{"text":"First trip to a movie theater in more than 5 years and my first to a dine-in, which we enjoyed once we FOUND it within the Esplanade complex.  Lobby was clean and attractive.  The entire complex as well as the theater in which we watched The Last Jedi was nearly empty for a 9:45 showing on a Sunday night, but appeared clean.  All interactions with staff as well as movie sight and sound was more than satisfactory.     We ordered popcorn ($9), 2 iced teas, and a brownie sundae to split, totaling roughly $30.  This was was delivered to our very comfortable seats in a reasonable time by a polite young server.    Men's room was decently attractive and reasonably clean, with minor qualm that on such a slow night, seems like someone might have picked up the paper towels overflowing the trash bins somewhere in the two hours between my initial visit and after the movie.   Overall, a pleasant, satisfactory experience."}
{"text":"Great way to see a movie,awesome recliners and great service  ,drinks and dinner should be more of these theaters around!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Super busy today (Mother's Day...go figure). Took a while for my server to take my order.  Chose the breadstick sampler (2 soft breadsticks and 6 pizzetta strips with queso blanco and marinara which I switch for alfredo sauce).  Got 4 sticks and no pizzetta.  Turns out--no pizzetta.  Ended up just keeping the breadsticks because my movie had already started and I was hungry.  Ordered a frozen strawberry margarita (these are so good!), but got it on the rocks.  Sent back.  Took about 25 minutes to get the drink, which was ordered before the food.  Again, I get that it was busy for a Sunday night.  But a little heads-up from the kitchen to the wait-staff about the pizzetta would have been helpful.  It's also nice to get your drink BEFORE the food when you have to drive.  Still love it here, but I'll be extra-cautious about when I go."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. I want to see Central Intelligence with my father and grandmother. There was a valet parking which made it easy and an escalator up to the AMC theater. There was a lot of Lounge area seating which was comfortable for the wait. The seats themselves were just ok but there was a button you could press under a light that called a person to your seat so that you can order whatever you would like off of the menu provided. The menu is superb what the prices are ridiculously expensive both for the food and the tickets. other than that great experience."}
{"text":"I've had a great experience everytime I've gone here. I just got done reading some bad reviews for this place and want to say that people should get over themselves. I have had food most of the time I have gone and out of about 8 things I have ordered 6 of them were great and two of them were ok or not good.  so.. I think that is a pretty good average for a theatre.  It's nice to have the option of dining and I don't expect the service to be like that of a normal restaurant because i'm there for the movie.  duh so for the whole experience it's absolutely great.  try it everyone and get the burger or the vege plate, it's awesome.  you can't beat an entire burger meal for ten bucks and you can have a cocktail with it as well.  very cool and I'm glad your here, and....if you want the server to kiss your feet, go to a restaurant and pay a hundred bucks for dinner and you'll probably get that, but.. you won't get an awesome movie experience either.  wise up people and stop being so critical, you obviously have never worked in the service business before and if you have...shame on you."}
{"text":"I have been sitting at the bar for 30 mins now and no one has asked me if I wanted anything!! The worst part is I've been staring at every bar tender as they walk by and they still do not acknowledge me! This is $$$ walking away and left a salty taste with the AMC experience. There's a gal with bleached white hair, an African guy with Afro spikes and a third guy....and not one \"hello\""}
{"text":"Will never go back here. We went the first time yesterday and were so disappointed. We pushed our button for service and they never came. My husband went to see what the hold up was and he was told they don't start taking orders until the movie starts. I guess yelling over the previews is more convenient to them. Finally we were able to put our orders of pretzel bites in. We were the first to order and last to receive our order. When we got the bites they were cold. My husband took them back to the server and he said \"that's how they come\". Really?? Who ever serves pretzel bites cold? Could it be that they just sat there for 20 minutes before he finally decided to bring it out to us?"}
{"text":"This theater pretends to be high class yet is subpar. My family and I went there to watch a matinee 3-D movie. The food was average yet the screen did not work &  we did not get to see the movie that we paid to see. In all fairness, they gave us passes to a future film but I can't help but feeling I wasted my time in driving to this theater to watch a movie. Kinda weird to eat lunch in a dark theater without a movie playing."}
{"text":"My all time favorite thing to do lately... make sure you go to a movie in the cinema suites where there are leather lazy -boy recliners, full food and beverage service, and you can call the waiter with the push of a button. I have been here probably 15 times and always had a great experience!"}
{"text":"$$$. Would suggest eating before a movie, it's on the expensive side. Lovely place though. The staff is friendly and helpful, comfortable seating and quality movies. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I loved it! Sooo over the top from the moist towellette, free mint, free refills, comfy seats with footrests and super helpful servers. Our only mistake was eating dinner before the movie --PLEASE whatever you do--go with an empty stomach or at least be ready to eat dessert to get the full experience!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Comfy chairs (although they don't recline :(...), full bar, reasonable tickets ($8.75 for matinee), reservable seats, and BEST OF ALL waiter service! Oh yeah, they come around to your seat before the show and multiple times during to see if you want another beer or some more popcorn and then present you with a bill at the end of the show. For me, this is the place to watch movies in Phoenix."}
{"text":"the first time i was there service as great, but as the second and third time came the service and staff was poor, the manager and staff just stood there joking and messing around with no intention of asking us if we need any help. The waiter was great food is good but lobby customer service is not all that great younger spike hair manager is kinda rude too."}
{"text":"Oh I love this movie theater so much. I just wish it was closer to my house. Whenever I have guests come from out of town, I take them here. I do not tell them why we are driving 45 minutes, and look at their faces when we get to the theater. They are always awestruck! I have always had wonderful experiences here. Its fabulous. You need to check out the 21+ suites at least once in your life. It will ruin regular movie theaters though! Once you have this luxury, you cannot go back easily.  I love being able to have a drink beforehand. it can be pretty expensive but it is all about the experience. Having a few cocktails before and during the movie just make it more fun.  I always order food. It is not the best food around, but again it is about the experience. I love reclining like a queen, and having them serve me food and drink with just a push of a button. I had the thai bang shrimp tacos, I dont recommend them, they were a little chewy. Their pizzettas are really good though. I also like the queso blanco dip, but it can be a little small if you are sharing. My dad said the prime rib sandwich was very tasty.  Make sure you make a reservation in advance using fandango so you can pick out your seats. The cinema suites can get packed fast, especially if it is a big movie.   This would have been 5 stars, but they took some of the perks away and it made me sad. If I never had the perks before, I would not have known, but I feel a little jipped every time I leave with out my hand towel, mint, and free sample popcorn. Please give me back my perks!"}
{"text":"I love the place best place for a date and to relax and watch a movie"}
{"text":"This place has a great setup and location but the service has suffered since opening.  The last 3 times I have gone there have been issues with my bill and our seats have not been clean.  The need more of a presence from management with the young staff.  I will no longer eat when seeing movies here because the food has really declined.  Feels like the inmates are running the asylum."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago and after reading some reviews i was both excited and nervous about going.   Excited because the idea of comfy seats, food, and NO kids sounds amazing!!! (And it was!) Worried about the server walking around during the film.   As it turned out my experience was great! So awesome to watch a movie in giant lazy boy chairs and eat something other than popcorn. The servers did a good job to only sneak by when a customer paged them. (However, if you are going to see a movie you can't miss a minute of .... maybe don't go to this theater.) Otherwise very enjoyable.   The food itself is pretty average, but at least not overpriced.   I would definitely come back again!   PS. Reserve seats in advance!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow,  took about 10-15 minutes to get a drink.  Should of gone to the bar,  when I got my drink it was all ice...  Food,  well I've had better.  We started with wings,  no flavor,  straight from the freezer to the deep fryer.     I had the chicken chipotle sandwich,  recommended by the waitress,  it was only partially filled and the dipping sauce was way tooo spicy,  and I like heat.  The bread or Pita it was served on was really dry.  Wasn't anything special,  and wouldn't order again.  My date had the chicken bowl,  she ate about a third of it.  That speaks volumes.    I would not eat there again.  Don't waste your time and hard earned money on mediocre food.  Maybe a beer would be the best bet.    Come on AMC,  you can do better than this."}
{"text":"Ok so lets start this off the right way by saying I was there for the Twilight Breaking Dawn Premier ... you think lot of teen girls screaming there heads off to see the film.  Nope ... 18+ for the whole theater when I walked in and had a seat in one of the lobby chairs I was properly greeted and offered a drink.  Wow that is great! I could even get a ADULT beverage ;) I like.  So I showed up about an hour early just not knowing what to expect and was informed by a greeter that we could go into the theater about thirty minutes early.  We get in the theater and where greeted with a smile by our waitress who took all are information and order and got us drinks with unlimited refills, get that large popcorn get unlimited free refills.  This is great now sure the tickets cost about $10.00 a person, Drinks are about 3.59 But unlimited refills.  Overall I had a great experience and look forward to being back again soon :)"}
{"text":"It's hard to go back to a regular theater after this! Just for an additional $2 per ticket you can enjoy Cinema Suites(over 21 only). Drinks, food, extremely comfortable and great customer service."}
{"text":"Went to a show a morning show and was only  $5. Seats were large and comfortable.  It was nice to he able to pick your seat ahead of time and come when you want instead of arriving early to get a good seat.  Service was good. Drink was $5 and  burger was $12. Still not too bad for getting to sit and have them bring it to you. Downside is that both the escalators are broken and only one elevator was working. I didn't mind the exercise, but it was three flights of steps to get to the entrance."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Eating while watching a movie is a brilliant idea. Food selection is okay, wish they had more vegan or vegetarian items. Also I don't like the fact that the drinks and popcorn sizes are all one size. I'd love to see all sizes available here just like at a regular AMC. Other than that, servers are nice and good is tasty. This time I got popcorn only and a glass of water. Popcorn was well made."}
{"text":"WTF...\"Sorry, we're outta butter.\"  No butter for movie popcorn?!? That's like McDonalds running out of fries. Note, this is Thursday, not the end of a weekend. Did I mention slow service?  Oh, and the ticket kiosks were either frozen or out of paper. This theater has gone downhill for many reasons - going back to Harkins.  As a follow-up after the movie:  Paid cash for drinks  and the \"server\" didn't bring all of my change back.   Not even mentioning the filthy restrooms. This was all late-morning BTW."}
{"text":"Living in Austin Texas, i am very familiar with the dining movie experience (Alamo Drafthouse).   So while my wife were in Phoenix on vacation, we decided to see two movies (01/19/2013).   the chair were very comfortable, and the call button is a good idea (just not well executed - more on that later).  I like the idea that you can reserve your seats, and the fold out \"tables\" worked very well.  I don't know how exactly this thing is ran, but my educated guess is that each server has a section in several different screens at the same theater all at the same time.  So it is sort of round robin when you will be helped, as the server has other screens they need to attend to.  I also don't know how the server is alerted when I hit the call button, but the response times were different in my two experiences.  In my early movie (11:30 am on a Saturday) our server was Jackson (at least that is what our receipt said, I thought his name was Nick, but he was a tall/slender black male - great server) and he generally arrived within 5 minutes.  (He was also very on top of it as a server).  Jackson delivered the bill with about an hour left in the movie.  To me, that is really early.  I would have almost rather given him my credit card up front, so that my service could have lasted longer (which by the way - means more sales of booze and food for AMC and Jackson).  Getting my bill an hour before the movie ended probably lost AMC ~$15 in extra sales.  When it came time to deliver the bill, Jackson had them all organized and just walked up the stairs and handed everyone their bill - he knew who's bill was who's before he walked up the stairs.  During the evening show that we attended (8:30 pm same day) we had the B-team server: Nick (at least that is what his nametag said - the bill said Graham - which is odd because I wasn't served by a Graham.  Either way, a tall white guy with a Justin Bieber looking haircut).  Nick struggled from the get go.  He was either having a rough day or isn't meant to be a server.  I ordered a beer and some food, and my wife started off with a water.  he asked if we wanted waters for both of us - I said sure.  The food came first (Weird!!!!) then the beer.  Waters never made it.  Nick was a no show, so we asked the runners, who somehow/someway got the message to Nick.  her water (not mine) showed up 30 minutes after we asked for them.  Later she ordered an entree, and it came fine.  After that I ordered another beer and a dessert.  the beer came - not the dessert. Oh yea, it took Nick ~25 minutes after I hit the call button to come answer it.  I almost turned it off... and wish that I did because 10 minutes after that my beer came.  So 35 minutes after I wanted a beer it was delivered to me - I'm sure AMC can do better. Nick came by to hand me the bill and I said that the dessert never came and I wanted to make sure it wasn't on the bill.  he hit himself on the front of his head a la Homer Simpson and said he screwed up and that it wasn't on our bill.  Also, Nick was not organized with his bills - he was in the aisle way sorting out the bills as he was walking up the stairs - disconcerting to the movie goers.    I'm sure AMC has studied this at length, so they can shoot holes through my theory, but why don't they have 1 or 2 servers take care of just one screen at a time?  It seems like the response time would be much faster (thus you sell more food).  Maybe it isn't fair to the servers or something, but who cares - isn't your guests' experience priority #1?  In general we enjoyed our experience.  the food is good, if not slightly overpriced.  I thought that the beer prices were reasonable, and free refills on soda and popcorn is A-OK with me.   if they could step up the service they would have a real winner. I also enjoyed that we could reserve our seats ahead of time - very cool."}
{"text":"This location has good service,  and the theaters are really comfy - if you go for cinema suites. The fork and screen theaters are too packed in,  and it's really not more comfortable than a regular theater. The only benefit is the food menu. You can't get burgers and cocktails at the regular theater!  Perhaps the only downsides are the limited availability of cinema suites showings, and the lack of vegetarian options on the menu."}
{"text":"On Cinema Suites*: If you are of age with no children or in a group full of adults, do yourself a favor and upgrade. Five stars for this experience.  With no children, you can eat comfortably and get engrossed in the movie without the unexpected jolt of a baby crying or a parent snapping at a kid to be quiet.   The smaller and more intimate setting with fewer seats and better chairs translates to comfort. I loved the fact that you can recline with your feet up and still use the large tray. To those who complain of not being able to eat when reclined, this isn't Rome. Sit up when you eat, and lay back when you're done. It's good for your digestion.  *Fork and Screen and Cinema Suites are separated by a wide, wide ocean of class, ambiance, and comfort. This review completely ignores Fork and Screen because of how bad it is."}
{"text":"So, for $16.50, you can get an oversized, leather reclining chair w/a side table and swivel tray over your lap, and fab view of the picture? I think it's money well spent. It's like flying first class - once you've got a taste of it, it's hard to go back to Coach. I felt like a true baller, I really did.  I do, however, wish AMC would consider bumping their OVERLY inflated meal/drink prices. I paid $4.50 for a Coke Zero? That hurt, it did. I didn't eat any food, but my friend's fries smelled heavenly.  Oh, and I wld also suggest better signage for parking. I got lost/trapped when parking at Gallagher Kennedy. I shrugged this off and found my way to AMC parking, but hit 2 dead ends in the garage by their loading dock. But, maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"Refused to serve my 68 year old client a beer because he left his id at home.  Sometimes rules are kinda silly. We won't ever come back.  Silly since this is a nice place with good food. Servers are just filling rules from idiots I guess."}
{"text":"No surprise to see a coke be over $5 but wasn't expecting there to be no refills. Movie and food was fine and all. I sat down towards the back and there was still trash on my seat and in my cup holder. I'll give it to the cleaning crew that they \"missed\" one chair...other people in the back were throwing some kind of candy at people below for being on the cell phone. Typical baggage that you would see in theaters. I wouldn't go back to this one because after paying $9 for a matinee and $17 for one meal, I would expect better behavior from the people in there. Guess I was wrong.   The crew working was as friendly and quick as they could be but they had almost no control over the actions of those others in the theatre. For dine in, the only distraction I would expect would be waiters talking to patrons about simple orders... Far opposite."}
{"text":"The first few times we came here, it was great. Unfortunately that has changed. The menu is smaller, the service is less than subpar and they raised the menu prices.  This is the second time we have been here when they have not brought my order but managed to bring everyone else's. My kids got three refills but the server didn't come back to me once. Additionally, my son ordered his burger without a bun because he can't have gluten and, of course, they brought it on a bun. Just one thing after another and their solution is one return pass. Yeah, not coming back so...keep it."}
{"text":"I had been to this theater many times before it converted to the dine-in style. We just returned from our first time since the conversion and we had a pleasant experience. Normally I would not make the drive to Esplanade since I now live in Tempe, but they had a March special for buy one get one free admission to any show. Getting a ticket was a slow process since they only had two people working and the lines were long. They do have ticket machines you can use, but I had to redeem the coupon I had so needed to wait in line. I loved that we could choose our seats before going into the theater.   Once we were seated, we ordered some drinks and the Breadstick Sampler appetizer from the specials menu. The two types of breadsticks were very good, some large soft pretzel sticks, and then some cheesy garlic breadsticks. They came with sides of queso and marinara sauce. I think I would stick with finger foods like this if I visited again. They should make the Breadstick Sampler a permanent menu item, I would have it again! Downside to eating in the dark - I was very tense trying to maneuver and make sure I didn't get any sauces on me or spill my drink.   The seats were comfy and I like that you have the option to swivel the tray table over your lap or leave it to the side. Service was very attentive. As we were leaving we filled out a short survey about our experience and they gave us each a $10 appetizer voucher. I imagine we will be back to use that at some point. Otherwise like I said it is too far from Tempe, but if AMC added a dine-in location in Tempe or Mesa or Chandler, I would gladly frequent it!"}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with it at all.  All the renovations are nice, and it was nice to be able to sit and have a beer while I watched the movie but everything else sucked.  The service sucked.  The food sucked. The as to the service, they take your order on a little ipad sort of thing, each person is assigned a seat number...I don't believe they actually record the seat down as the waitress continually brought everything to me. other peoples food and drinks...and checks! Ugh. ALSO she brought my 15 year old cousin a BEER! WTF! We all received our food at the same time, except for my husband...he had ordered a burger and for some reason it took a good 15 minutes to arrive.  Drink service was quick.  The food itself was sub-par. I got chicken tenders. They did not have the taste or texture of chicken. they were really weird.   I would say save your money and don't order dinner here. We will be back, but will only do drinks and light snacks."}
{"text":"This theater is the best! Great seating and good food. Great place to take a date or a good friend from out of town. Service is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix visiting my brother, we decided to see Pitch Perfect 2 at this theater. We got tickets for the theater with the reclining seats, and it was awesome! The seats reclined and the footrest came up, and the seats were incredibly comfortable! We also decided to eat while at the theater and we each ordered chicken fingers and French fries, which were SO good. We were so happy with our experience at this theater and I would love to come back to this theater again!"}
{"text":"We grabbed a movie here recently. Liked the valet parking. Nice food selection and we tried the Sushi roll and I believe the Chicken Strips. Both were good. Server was fast and overall a fun way to spend a couple hours."}
{"text":"I have to say I was really impressed by this theatre's food.  I ordered the avocado chicken.  The chicken was salty but well cooked.  The fries that came with it were really good too!  What was even more amazing was the chocolate brownie milk shake! Awesome brownie and chocolate."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite place to watch a movie.  The comfy Lazy Boy like recliners are awesome!  The menu selection and food is great.  I love the service as well.  If you have never been, you will absolutely love it and return again and again."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. It's so sad because it was my little treat to myself to be pampered with drinks and food while I enjoyed a quality movie. I came here last night and there were about 6 or 7 very awkward and impersonal employees behind the bar. My girl and I opened a tab and we're just hanging out until our movie started and at least 4 people in a row asked us if we wanted to close our tab. After telling 3 previous employees we wanted to keep our tab open, we finally decided on the 4th ask to close out. How annoying! Do you not understand the concept of an open tab? Everyone here looks frumpy and ungroomed. The whole staff needs a shower and a haircut. I also noticed the crowd is now a bunch of scummy looking people.   Now for the food: $8 for 5 boneless chicken bites. Ru fucking kidding me?  The theater: giant dividers between each row made it very difficult for me to see the screen.   In theater wait staff: Slow and incompetent.   We purchased tickets online for the 2d version of Star Wars and of course we show up and they tell us it's 3D. We were offered a refund but we had waited long enough to see the movie.   Conclusion: This theater is no longer worth the amount of money they charge. The wait staff is unpleasant and boring, you are no longer treated as high class to match the ticket price, crowd is a bunch of skanks."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge movie goer and much less to fancy places seeing how I'm from Idaho, so this place was freaking awesome for me and like nothing I've ever experienced.   It's definitely not cheap, but I was pretty dang impressed with the food. I had the Mediterranean Mac and it was huge and a couldn't finish it but it was super good, and my wife had the appetizer sampler and everything on that was really good. So all in all the food was surprisingly really good.   The seats were amazing. Suuuuuper comfy and they recline mechanically. There was also so much space and didn't feel at all crammed like most other movie theaters. The only real problem I had was I couldn't really see the bottom of the screen. I don't know if it was just the row we were sitting in that made it hard to see the bottom of the screen but it sucked. I had to really sit up to see the bottom. But other than that it was amazing!"}
{"text":"We decided we would watch Wonder Woman at this location.  I'm pretty sure this location is new so they still have some kinks to work out.  If you don't know where you're going, it can be quite confusing.  The parking garage we chose because the sign said it was for AMC was a bit of a walk and a confusing one at that.  I would have preferred that they had a sign leading us to the garage that is actually right beneath the theatre.  When we finally figured out how to get to the entrance, the escalator going up was closed and suggested taking the elevator.  Well, the elevator was not in service either so we ended up taking the stairs.  Luckily, I'm in shape and it was no big deal but what if I wasn't?  Once we finally got to the top, we did notice that there was another escalator and elevator on the opposite side, which would have been nice to know.  However, again, there was no signage letting us know this.  Such an ordeal just to get to the entrance of the theatre.  Once inside, the first thing you notice is the huge bar where a snack stand would normally be.  But there's no snack stand.  Anything you want to order is done through your server inside the theatre, including soda and popcorn, which also means you must now tip said server.  The theatre was nice but no reclining seats.  You do get a swing table that you can use to eat on as well as a call button for your server.    Overall, a very nice theatre and great for a date night.  However, I feel that some of the other theatres that fall into this category are a better fit for me.  Not determined to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went for a midnight showing... no waiting in line, comfortable seats, it was a great experience. Cinema suites is the way to go!"}
{"text":"The waitress sneaks up on you and scares the crap out of you if you arent paying attention. They are ninjas here, or something.   Besides being served food here, its a typical theatre. Nice big chairs which are comfortable to sit in an enjoy.  I wish the lights next to each seat would turn off because it gets annoying that they stay on during the movie. I like it more dark.  We only went because we had an AMC gift card and this is the closest to us. Otherwise if you dont plan on ordering over priced and visually un-appetizing food, go to another theatre"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here numerous times. The location is decent - I like that the Biltmore/Union shopping center is right across the street. Plus, Fuego Tacos is down below and tasty. However, there isn't much else in this plaza. A few places to eat, but whenever we visit, everything seems dead. While the parking lot can get pretty full, there's never anyone walking around. It's like a ghost town!  My husband and I used to come here more frequently, but when they closed to upgrade to the dining experience, we realized the Desert Ridge location is much closer to us. (We found out they were renovating the hard way. We stopped by one afternoon to find the AMC closed and none of the restaurants were open yet. Again, total ghost town!) Needless to say, we haven't tried the new dining experience but it's on our list. Once we try the new dining experience, look for an updated review!"}
{"text":"Food is pricey but reserving your seats is great! Not to mention if you're on a date you can go in to the screening for 21 and older and don't have to deal with children crying."}
{"text":"This dine-in movie experience is very cool. Make sure you book your movie to the right type of theater, so you can get the best experience possible. There is a full bar and restaurant that is catered to you in the theater, so that you can kick back, relax, and enjoy your movie while eating dinner. Totally fun and super relaxing! :)"}
{"text":"Since they made these theatres \"AMC Dine-In\" theatres, it's my favorite place in the Phoenix area to see a movie. It's nice, upscale and you pick your own seats.  The stadium theatres are the way to go. They're large, with huge, motorized reclining seats and walls in front of you and behind you. You can't see anyone behind you or in front of you, and you can't really see or hear anyone in your row, save for the person/people next to you. You get a dedicated server who will bring you anything from a soda to movie candy to spinach dip. There is also a full bar, so that's a plus. I haven't had a full meal there, but I've had a dessert (which was good), and service is attentive while being surprisingly unobtrusive.   The smaller theatres are still good, just not as secluded. I absolutely hate hearing people talk during movies, and I don't like children in the theatre, so the larger spaces are my favorite, since you can't really see/hear anyone and you have to be 21+ to see a movie in the stadium areas.   It's not as swanky as iPic, which feels like a nightclub in Vegas, but it's much cheaper ($12 per ticket for smaller theatres, $15 for stadium), and you get the wait staff here as well.  Totally recommend, I know I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Five Rivers went to go see the Black Panther my husband ordered fish and chips my grandson ordered fish and chips I have fish and chips one had a hamburger and I don't remember what the 5th one had. Before we left the movie my stomach started feeling tight and strange we got home about 10 I went outside to smoke a cigarette man I threw up like The Exorcist .  And that was in February I still have the tickets in my phone the fish was cold I thought it might be a little cold from the delivery but I'm thinking that it was not to the temperature. That morning my 10:00 grandson had to fish he got sick he was sick all through the day. My first experience I was excited because it was a dine-in theater but"}
{"text":"Went to watch Jungle Book and although we enjoyed the movie a lot, the service was not that great! Very disappointing!   We put our order in first thing when we were seated, all I ordered was the sushi roll and an icee to drink. While my sushi roll came out quickly, I had to press the red button to remind them of my icee.  When the waiter came, he said you still haven't gotten it? Uh... no! He seem frustrated and said he will get it. By the time I received my icee I had already finished my roll!  The food is good, the seats were torn and needs to be replaced. It has the potential to be better with the service!   I would recommend choosing the smaller theater since the bigger theatre seems overwhelming to the wait staff and you would be waiting a while! Also, with the smaller theater the leg room is bigger and more comfortable!"}
{"text":"The dine in theater is an intriguing idea. Unfortunately, here it is so poorly executed, with food below fast food par, but at upscale cost. Seating is hit or miss in terms of the better auditoriums showing the various films. Essentially, you eat in the dark, not seeing how the food is actually prepared & presented. Service is also hit or miss with a bias towards misses. It's a bit more than the cost of a regular movie, but for recent releases, which have the better auditoriums, it can be nice, so long as you steer away from anything but French fries, that are more like Jack In The Box. Though you can get some alcoholic drinks, is it really worth it with places like Merc Bar downstairs from the theater? Dont forget to allow for tipping if youre dining here. All this doesn't touch on the horrible parking situation at this location.GET YOUR PARKING TICKET VALIDATED!!!!  In summary, if you want to see a popular 1st run show upon its release, and can do without the food service experience, it can be nice. Otherwise, avoid it like the plague!  Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Got here and every movie is sold out even if seats available.  Make sure to choose your seats or you end up in the front row!!!  Favorite theatre but sucks last two times."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that there was a place like this after Farelli's closed. The seating was a bit confusing at first to know what to pick from never being there before. But once we got in and seated we fell in love with the huge cushion recliners. The drinks were fine but a bit pricey. I ordered a type of nacho and it was really good but greasy and hard to find the jalpenos in the dark. My husband had the parm fries and they were awesome! I wsih there was one of these on the west side because I would totally be frequenting it more!"}
{"text":"I like this theatre a lot because of its location, the warm, reclining seats, and they generally play a mixture of indie and mainstream films. I've ordered food on a few occasions. The servers are pretty quick and the food came out fast considering a lot of people tend to order food during the night showings (which is when I like to go watch movies). I hate kids, so the best part is people don't drag their noisy brats into this theatre at night just because it's kinda physically demanding to get to (you walk up a few flights of stairs). Thank you for keeping the brats and their annoying, self-entitled parents away!!!"}
{"text":"my wife and i really like the value proposition ooutIf dinner and a movie in one, and a comfy recliner to eat in.  its way cheaper than the Ipic, and the food is pretty good without being too much.  if the movie isn't any good, just have a few mojitos and you'll feel better about it.  my one gripe in case management is reading this:  they need to clean the menus more often.  They're sticky.  Edited on 08/01/2016 because I would have thought they could improve on theater cleanliness by now, but instead of getting better it's gotten worse.  If clean restrooms and clean seats are important to you, go visit the ipic in North Scottsdale.  Wife and I were there on Saturday for star trek and spent $90 on dinner, drinks, and tickets.  Though the theater wasnt busy, every surface was covered in sticky goop.  They would never get away with this in a normal, well lit restaurant, and should feel lucky they haven't had corrective action from Maricopa county environmental services.  Definitely won't take the kids there.     Try the Bistro Mac n Cheese."}
{"text":"Came here tonight to go see \"it comes at Night\". Getting our tickets came with no problem. Downside, went in sat on our seat c3 and c4 and just happens that one of our recliner seats wasn't working. We tried every vacant spots and still wasn't working. Then we moved to a different row, our seating was working this time but this couple next to us wouldn't stop talking and phone kept ringing a handful of times. Decided to go at the top, now this time seat wasn't working again. There was a light that was on , and 20 minutes later got turned off. I've been here plenty of times and every single time I've been disappointed. Only good thing is that managers were apologetic and got our tickets refunded. I'd rather go to Ipic theaters , harkins or roadhouse cinema for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my past 2 visits to AMC Esplanade. I'm new to Phoenix and looking for a good place to see movies several times a month. The waiter did not bring my check to my seat and asked me to follow him to the lobby to process my check. Then on receiving my check, he charged me for food I didn't order. Then sent another waiter out of the kitchen for the correct bill. In the confusion between several waiters, my credit card was lost. After an unhelpful conversation with management my card was not found or returned. Another visit, the armrest on my seat was broken, no padding, just a hard metal bar between the seats. Even though this is the closest theater to me, I will not be returning and will gladly drive further for a better movie viewing experience."}
{"text":"It's close to me, so I go here, and usually it's pretty empty. You're always assured a seat in air conditioning! They've always got the top movie selections - but the reason why it's not my favorite theaters is the PARKING - oy! What a pain in the butt! You have to park in the retail/restaurant parking garage, walk in the outdoor mall that is the Esplanade, but then you have to remember to get your ticket validated. Once I went and forgot, then gave my ticket to the parking lot guy - he said that they can't take that as validation anymore - $15!!! On top of my movie purchases, it was unreasonable. They should really stress making sure you have your parking taken care of. Either that, or I'm going only with people who promise to remind me to get validation!"}
{"text":"We ordered our food before the movie started and 25 mins before the movie was over STILL. NO. FOOD. We pressed the button so we could cancel, but no one came. After waiting a few minutes we walked out (not knowing there was only 20 mins left) and went to guest services to see if we would be able to get passes to come back and try again and explained what happened with our order. They did not believe us and went to check and make sure we didn't eat our food and the rude, loud guy (not a manager) was demanding that we pay our full bill. They said no passes bc there was only 15 mins. Definitely NOT worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I loved it! I liked that I could buy my tickets online and you could pick your own seat. I also loved the big comfy chairs. What's up with that light right behind the seats though? You can even dine in or buy drinks. What's not to love?  I'm new to this area so I really didn't know what to expect. I didn't know if they allow you to take snacks and drinks inside. i stopped and bought a soda at McDonald's and no one seemed to know if the theater allowed you yo bring drinks.  The parking sit. Is a bit tricky. First, I pulled into one driveway where I saw the valet sign. Nope! I'm not a baller today. I then preceded around back and parked in the theater parking lot. The only problem with the theater parking structure is that the elevators don't work, so you're instructed to take the stairs on the west side. I'm not from Phoenix so I have no  sense of direction here. I can't even see the sun so I can't determine East from West that way. Ugh! I just tried the next best thing and parked close to all the other cars. It was pretty empty Saturday morning. Hasn't everyone heard about the $6 early bird special???"}
{"text":"This really is a nice theater. The seats are very roomy, it is set up very nicely for dining, and there are free refills for soda (even though a soda is about $4 haha). If you have never dined at a theater before, I would just suggest that you get there at least 15 minutes early to order your food (the servers are very good at working with you and explaining what to do). I would also suggest not to each a movie that requires a lot of focus as the servers and food certainly can distract you (I watched \"The Duff\" and it was just fine :)"}
{"text":"I've Visited several dine in movie theaters recently. I've been impressed once so far unfortunately this is not one of them. It seemed rather average. It took a long time for the service to respond once the button was pushed.  Two of our meals required silverware which we didn't get that had the ring the bell button again and wait for those to arrive. We ordered for drinks one of them was a diet and our server couldn't figure out which one was which. The chicken in the southern fried crispy tenders was tough. There are better options."}
{"text":"First let me say the 3D movie was great and so were all of the employees. HOWEVER, the rating is tainted by the dinner. I had the beef bowl and that tasted ok or low quality; not the case, it was contaminated causing me a night of...illness. I tried to call the manager let them know so they could take steps for health safety. I got a recoding that asked if I'd like to speak to an associate press zero. I did so and then after many rings a recording came on and said \"the system is unable to complete your call at this moment please call again later\". So I thought I would just alert you all. ORDER DINNER AT YOUR OWN RISK."}
{"text":"leave it to corporate america to capitalize on a great idea (ipic) and roll it out, steamrolling everyone in the way...  --book your seat in advance using the website (fandango's mobile site integration not working at the time of this review) I LOVE LOVE LOVE knowing that my seat is MINE, and if it isn't available, i'll just have to look for another showing --choose from either the exclusive cinema suites (think first class airline seat, and then some), or the more standard and rowdy \"fork and screen\" --efficient and hardworking servers and food runners. --the concept is excellent, but with declining food quality, it could die off quickly. why would i pay $8 for a (cracked) plastic bowl of popcorn? goddamit!  #chicken wings gone south. they're the fatty and mushy \"pump-me-full-of-antibiotics-while-i-stand-in-my-own-shit-while-the-steroids-grow-me-bigger-than-my-body-was-ever-going-to-grow-in-90-days-fee-lot-meat\" SHIT \"chicken\" #that means they're cutting other corners too... yikes. #food often arrives \"dead\" cold. SEND IT BACK. #be careful to be specific when ordering; many items are similar and your server will assume. #effect of dining while you watch has literally put all the nearby restaurants out of business. the esplanade is a ghost town note to lessees: always put a clause in your contract that competitors in the same property must be approed by you!  HINT: push the service button between your seats as soon as you arrive, even if the server stops by to say he'll be right with you. the button starts a timer which sends an \"all call\" if someone doesn't reach you quickly."}
{"text":"Esplanade is quite possibly my favorite theatre.  I bought my tickets for a 5:30 Saturday showing of Iron Man 3 (opening weekend) on the Wednesday before. Their website was glitching during my purchase, so I called and an incredibly nice dude named Eric let me purchase my tickets over the phone. Thanks, Eric! Saturday evening came along, and we walked into the theatre at 5:20. Hey, my comfy seats are saved! No standing awkwardly at the front, searching for a spot. Just sit, order your beer, get me some mozzarella sticks, life is good. Halfway through the previews and you've already run out of your Stella Artois? No worries, Husband! Just press that button next to you and a server quickly comes by to grab your refill order. Who knew there'd be 10 previews. Didn't it used to be 4? Jeez, I'm starting to feel old.  I prefer the Cinema Suites, since they're 21 and over. No kids in the seats behind you kicking your chair for two hours because their parents are three rows higher, splitting a bottle of red and not giving a crap. I believe we've learned our lesson in the Fork and Screen....  and that lesson is to split a bottle of wine and not give a crap! HELLO, that's genius. And also get some seats in the Cinema Suites.   High five, AMC."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a movie, while the prices are generally higher it's worth the extra money.  Food is not the greatest but it's about what you would expect out of a movie theater.  The biggest complaint I have is that the chairs are to low and when you recline them back you miss a quarter to a half of the screen. This problem could easily be fixed by raising the seats or putting in a glass wall in front instead of it being solid"}
{"text":"Decided to go watch the avengers movie here. Ordered a pitcher of beer, 20 mins later they give me a pitcher of beer......but no cups. I spent the next 30-45 mins pushing my button, asking 4 different people for two glasses. When i finally got 2 glasses, they were the coca cola plastic ones, not a chilled glasses that everyone else had. So we got to drink warm beer. I will never return to this place, cant even do something as simple as bring cups with a pitcher. Braindead...."}
{"text":"Came to this location to see a movie with my husband. Bought tickets beforehand. Got a text with the ticket link. Once we got to the theater, we stood in 3 different lines. No one knew how to take the electronic tickets or how to print off paper tickets. We got inside the theater and ordered a chocolate shake. They brought us a Diet Coke. We sent it back and waited an hour before they brought the shake. At the end of the movie, they brought us a bill and then never came to collect payment. We went to the bar and told them what happened. No apologies were given. No acknowledgement of how bad they were at customer service. Don't waste your time or date night trying out this place."}
{"text":"So the movie was amazing but this theater is shit. I will never come back. Horrible experience and I'm super disappointed. Expensive and none of the food tasted very good and our service or lack of service was just insane. Seriously don't come here.  Not worth it at all. I'll stick with studio movie grill. It was my moms birthday they screwed up our order and then instead of just removing the item from our check they gave me a stupid coupon for 12$ off my next visit? What next visit? Seriously? We left both of our lights for service on FOREVER at one point and they never came back so we gave up and shut them off halfway through the film. Seats are too close together no leg room could hardly stand after the 2 hour movie I was in so much pain. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Very sad, disappointing night.  Just came back from seeing the showing of Grease -- 40th Anniversary showing.  1) the movie started but the background \"elevator music\" was still playing over the movie sound track from the movie.  2). After about 10 minutes into the movie, they restarted the movie thank God.  3). Food and beverage service was mediocre at best.  4). My friend received an order of pretzel bites he did not order......did not receive the order he placed.......until we pressed the call button 3 times.   Finally got that, but his chicken tenders were cold and dry!! 5) I never received a final beverage order, with 30 minutes left, but was still charged for it.   6)  Did not even receive my bill at the end,  even though I gave the server my debit card when I first sat down and ordered.  Had to track down the manager to actually get my bill to sign for it.  Basically,  not sure if I'd ever go back,  not even to use the free pass they handed out at the beginning of the show due to the screwup.  Just really bad service overall and a less than wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This place like other AMC is going down hill fast.  Just 2 yrs ago I would have given 4-5 stars.  Seats are Falling apart.   Cracks in leather.   Last time I went the armrest was missing.   I know this place gets a lot of business and I would think profitable.  However if they don't maintain it I will stop going soon."}
{"text":"A good concept to keep what was a dyeing movie theater alive.  The big comfortable reserved seats and no one under 18 without supervision policy make for a nicer viewing experience.  You can see movies in a suite cinema for $3 more, the only point I see in spending more money for a nicer seat is knowing you're in a theater where everyone is over 21.  Not worth it to me.  The full bar in the spot that used to be a concession stand is a nice touch.  The food is reasonably priced, but not all that good.  The burger I had was probably on par with something from a cliche american chain restaurant.  Decent, but nothing special.  You can get much better food across the street for similar prices.  I also found it a little difficult to eat my meal.  The big reclining leather seats are nice for movie viewing, but I did not enjoy leaning forward to take a bite and not worry about spilling all over myself.  The staff did a nice job of trying to stay transparent during the movie.  You have to press the button for service, but the waiter did quietly ask if I needed anything else when he bused away my empty tray, and dropped off the check.  And to make things better, when the credits started rolling he advised audience members who were getting up to leave to stay until the end because there was a stinger.  The heads up was much appreciated.  I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to give this theater a try.  But if you live in the Biltmore or Arcadia areas, this is probably your best option."}
{"text":"Prior to visiting this place I thought the dinner/alcohol/movie concept was a brilliant one....now? Not so much.  Pros:  -Big Cozy Seats -Alcohol  -Food   Cons: -The big cozy seats have big huge consoles that make it impossible for one to get cozy w/their movie date (the whole yawn & stretch routine won't fly here fellas) -Higher than normal ticket prices (up to $5 more) -Parking is kind of inconvenient (be sure to bring in your ticket for validation) -Tickets need to be purchased in advance (this cannot be done via gift card) -Food/Alcohol is somewhat pricey/undesirable ($20 pre-tip for faux chicken fingers and soda) My friend even let an alcoholic beverage go to waste..it was that bad  All in all, I didn't love it. The theater was nice, our server was sweet, and the movie (Warm Bodies) was bomb diggety, but in the future I think I'll skip the extra cost/ inconvenience and resort back to watching films the good old fashioned (eat a delicious dinner elsewhere) way."}
{"text":"This used to be the ONLY theatre we would go to in Phoenix. Now, after a long series of declining experiences, it's the only theatre we WON'T go to. Consistently dead escalators and elevators (it's a third floor theatre), ever declining service levels and (sorry) a horribly incapable staff all conspire to make for a lousy but expensive theatre experience. Go ANYWHERE else and you'll be happier."}
{"text":"Took 40 minutes to get two Caesar salads to go today.  Ridiculous.  Way over priced as well.  I won't go back again."}
{"text":"World class place! I've been to a couple dine in theaters and honestly the food is usually sub par with high prices because of convenience. But this place had great food! I would eat at this place if it were just a restaurant. Great service as well! And still one of my favorite concepts, feed me while I recline and watch a movie- ahhhh so relaxing"}
{"text":"Saw a movie here for the very first time last night. Decided to take my friend for her birthday since it looked spectacular from the website and we wanted to try something different. We usually go to Studio Movie Grill so I expected it to be similar...  There were definitely a lot of differences starting with the fact that they don't let you print your tickets from home. You have to pick them up at a kiosk when you arrive which was actually very quick and easy as long as you have the credit card you bought the tickets with on you. Also, they have a specific age rule so that kids under the age of 18 aren't allowed to go there unless they are accompanied by a parent or guardian over the age of 21. What a great rule!   There was a pretty good sized bar in the front lobby but not a single person was sitting at it. The bar at SMG has always been packed out every time I've gone, so this should have been a red flag.   About 15 minutes before the start of our movie, we headed into our designated theater. I was really excited until we walked in and there was a horrible stench. To be honest, it smelled like Chuck E Cheese.   Our seats were great! Smack dab in the center of the room. They were also very comfortable and clean. The problem was it was so dark, we had to squint to read our menus. And this was before the movie! A waiter appeared literally 2 minutes later and asked us what we wanted which was unexpected since I hadn't even pressed the call button yet. We both thought the mac and cheese sounded really good but I ended up ordering a Pizzini which is supposedly one of their \"signature items\" and she got a bacon cheeseburger. If you get a Pizzini, they charge you 99 cents to upgrade to french fries or else you are stuck with crunchy, loud potato chips. No way was that appropriate for the movie! We also both ordered diet cokes since the alcoholic beverages were way too overpriced and I had already spent $12.75 each on the tickets.   The food came out really quickly. Almost too quickly to the point where I started to question how fresh it was. The fries were way too salty and tasted like they were from McDonald's. The Pizzini was very dry and bland. Luckily it came with a special dip that was sort of spicy, but still decent.   After eating half of the Pizzini and half of the fries I was extremely full. Decided to focus on the movie and save the rest of my food to take home for later. However, I was unable to do that because THEY DON'T GIVE OUT TO GO BOXES?!  About 20 minutes before the movie ended I pressed the call button to see if I could get one, but nobody ever showed up. At that point there was still one waitress roaming around collecting people's bills, but she didn't even acknowledge me. I can't believe they would have the nerve to charge $12 for an entree and then not even allow us to take any leftovers home. This was a huge disappointment, but mainly because I hate wasting food. On our way out I looked to see if anyone else had received a box, but they hadn't.   One of the main reasons why I probably won't go back to this theater was that parking was a huge pain. It's one of those structures where you take a ticket and then when you leave you have to stick it in a machine and pay. At least I was able to get away with not paying since the movie theater validates tickets at the front when you walk in. Just be sure to keep your ticket with you, and not in your car.   Overall, I was not impressed. Was expecting a first -class experience, but instead received one that was mediocre. I think I am going to stick with Studio Movie Grill since it is cheaper and the food is much better."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here! Sometimes the service can be slow if the theater is full, but other than that, service is usually pretty good. The food is decent. The selection could be better. The drinks are good and usually change, where the are specialty mixes."}
{"text":"Students pay student prices ONLY on Thursdays.  Otherwise, everyone pays $9.50 per ticket past 6p (seniors may have discounted rate).   $9.50!  Good thing garage parking is validated up to four hours!    On a positive note, in fifteen minutes or more, I get to squeeze in a good workout before catching a movie.  I love climbing up and down those flights of stairs!"}
{"text":"I've gone a couple times and always enjoyed myself. They have two types of theaters, one for only over the age of 21 and the other is for over the age of 18 or with an adult's presence. I've only ever gone to the the one for adults only. The seats are very comfortable and the servers do a nice job bringing food and drinks, but still staying out of the way of the viewing audience.  The food is really good. I'm a huge fan of the macaroni and cheese. It's got grilled chicken and comes with a piece of pretzel bread that's doughy and perfect to dip in left over cheese sauce. My husband likes the jalepeno burger, jalepenos are diced into the meat and fried jalepenos are served on top of it. There is a bar in the front of the theater and the drinks are really good too.  Parking for the Esplanade is validated for up to 4 hours and is easy enough to get in and out of."}
{"text":"Great idea -- bad followthrough.  Drinks were weak, despite their price.  Food was decent, although we had to eat ours WITH OUR HANDS.  The server never brought silverware or napkins.    After the food was served and we realized we were utensil-less, we rang the call button and the proceeded to wait 20 minutes, while NO ONE came to answer the button and our hot food got stone cold.  I ordered a brussels sprouts appetizer and another main dish.  My husband ordered a steak salad.  My main dish never arrived, so after we finished eating our now-cold-food WITH OUR HANDS and the film came to a close, the server walked over and plunked down the tab on my tray without a word.  I handed it right back to her, saying I never received my main dish, silverware or napkins.  There was no acknowledgement of, or apology for, the missing dish, utensils and napkins.  Next joke!"}
{"text":"Theater #5 - Row B Photo Attached.  Center of the house would be rows C & D.  The last row has a big wall in front of you and you are near the ceiling.  Very large screen.  Overall good food.  Service was not as good as the Roadhouse Cinemas.  Overall 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Finally tried the New AMC theater. I am a loyal Harkins T-shirt wearing ,cup toting  Movie goer. But the old man and I decided it was time.   1- Most comfortable theater we have ever been in! We were in the Cinema Suites side. It was first class the whole way. Seats lay almost flat.  2- You can order food/ drinks- adult beverages- The whole Cinema Suites area is 21 and over- no kiddies... 3. Food was really really good. We had burgers and fries- Delish. I also had a waffle, maple, bacon ice cream dessert- Best dessert I've had in a while. If you order soda- free refills. I ordered bottled water. Later noticed others just getting tap water- I will order that next time. 4. Even though I gave it a 5 star I have to mention. There are lights that stay on during the movie and the wait staff are walking by a lot. I was ok with that- but that may drive others crazy. 5. Not for the poor- We paid $33.12 for 2 tickets- and $68.63 plus $12.00 tip for dinner. 2 burgers and fries, 2 drinks, 2 desserts and $12.00 for the rewards stubs card.  6. Until we hit the lottery- we will reserve going to this theater for very special occasions or for movies that are 2 1/2 hours or longer."}
{"text":"Way ,way overpriced! They don't use cups with lids go figure!!! I got an entire cup spilled all over me and my boyfriend! Greasy overpriced popcorn! I prefer the seats popcorn and loyal program Harkins provides. Don't waste your money unless you get the lounging seat theater!"}
{"text":"Why can't they bring something like this to Tucson!!!  Their service is off the charts! Unbelievable!  I'd pay these prices for this service any day."}
{"text":"I've been to IPIC, studio movie grill...the other dine-in locations and this place was good. The food was great and the seats comfortable. The staff was professional and parking was easy. They validate parking at the front."}
{"text":"What a nice change! I enjoy much more the whole movie experience! Been there since they opened it back then and with the remodel to a new level, I can go more than just being inside of a movie theater! The food is good, the drinks with more options; it just fun!!"}
{"text":"Worth. Every. Penny.  Recently went to AMC Esplanade for a movie and WOW. Tickets were $15 but considering what they come with, it was worth it!  They boast a full menu and bar, and prices are decent- similar to eating at many chain restaurants. Thought the popcorn was a little expensive- it's $7 for a small bag, but you can get free refills. I had the Sicilian Pizzini ($9.99 with Parmesan fries), and a Shock Top beer. My meal was delicious! It was crazy to think I was eating that in a movie theatre.   The seats fully recline and are incredibly comfortable! They make a little squeaky noise as you adjust during the movie, but it's not enough to notice or annoy other movie goers. The staff was excellent and attended to our needs immediately after we called for them.   As someone who is time challenged, being able to reserve and pay for seats online at home was a huge help! We got there 5 minutes to showtime and our seats were waiting for us, instead of having to search to find seats together. Cinema Suites are 21+ too, which was a nice plus with no children!  I will never go to another theatre again. It's either watch at home, or go to Cinema Suites."}
{"text":"This is easily the worst theater I've ever been to. Seats are wildly uncomfortable, and make an obscene amount of noise anytime anyone moves. On top of that upon getting to my seat I found it covered in spilled soda and sticky (are there not people to clean the theaters??). attendants run into and out of the theaters the entire movie but didn't bother to tell the patrons being incredibly loud to respect the rest of the paying customers and shut the hell up. Hey AMC, you know what makes lots of loud noise? Ice in plastic cups. So why do you serve your soft drinks this way? To add to the noise of the creaky uncomfortable seats?   Lastly, the parking and theater is not easily handicapped accessible. The parking directions for the theater is vague. We ended up parking in the wrong lot and my 85 year old grandmother who just had hip replacement surgery had to walk much farther than she should have to get to the theater. Staff was snarky and unhelpful when this was mentioned. Getting out of the parking lot was just as convoluted. No signage for exits and when there were signs they led to nowhere. WTF esplanade? Get your shit together.   Suffice it to say we will never be back to this theater."}
{"text":"The new Esplanade provides a nice afternoon or evening out. The price for the regular movies is comparable to 3D movies and much more worth it.  The seats (especially the ones in Cinema Suites, which fully recline!) are comfortable. The wait staff is very friendly and attentive. The refreshments are good, and food and drink prices are not inflated and more reasonable that those at the sports stadiums. An imported beer and unlimited popcorn is $13, not more than most theaters' large combos.  Parking is validated. If you are the ultimate movie fanatic, are not picky about atmosphere, and can go to movies at 10 in the morning, you can find a better deal elsewhere. But if you are a regular Joe, you will enjoy an occasional movie at the Esplanade."}
{"text":"A very cool concept and if I could give a 4.5 star I would. The ONLY downfall is the ledge covers the very bottom of the screen the higher up you sit. The food prices are extremely reasonable for a movie theater.. Great job AMC!"}
{"text":"I give it a 3 because you can get beer. But that is where my happiness stops. Menus are always sticky. Service has been terrible the last few trips. Drinks wrongly ordered or don't come out at all. Seats are duct taped in red tape....just because it is the same color as the seat doesn't hide the tacky patch job. Food is just okay. I prefer other AMC locations to this subpar experience."}
{"text":"Honestly the whole experience at this theater keeps getting worse each visit. Food quality is poor, price is high, service is way below average. For a family of 3- we bought tickets for $35 which is fine- but then choose to use the \"dine in\" aspect of this location...the server was friendly at first but service was poor. We ended up spending $75 on food and drinks where the boneless wing basket was laughable- I honestly thought some nuggets had accidentally fallen into our sauce basket and they were bringing us more wings- my sons popcorn came 35 minutes into the movie after I had to ask twice- even though we ordered prior to start of film...and then our waters never came out - so I went to the bar myself and got them. The servers were laughing and chatting amongst themselves in a little kitchen/nook area, yet rarely checked on their patrons. I have worked in pubs, coffee shops, and 5 star resorts... it doesn't matter location- service should always be a priority. Maybe management should do some training of basics. As a theater we enjoy it but if you're offering food and beverage you need to step it up."}
{"text":"I can say hands down I won't be returning.  We were able to enjoy the preview weekend offered for the new Fork & Screen features, and the best thing I can say about it was I'm glad it was free.  All in all we enjoyed 2 free movie tickets, as well as free dinner and soda.  When we arrived we were helped quickly by a friendly guy who helped us get our tickets and headed to the new bar in the lobby.  I order a pomegranate martini from the menu and was shocked with the $7.99 cost arrived in the smallest martini glass I've ever seen.  In addition to being outrageously priced, which on this instance wasn't too bad since I didn't pay for much else it was terrible.    Even though we'd been told to arrive very early we were unable to actually enter our theater until 30 minutes before show time (even though the theater had been empty for nearly 40 minutes before we were able to be seated).  Once seated we experienced how close together the seats were.  I spent most of my evening being kicked, which isn't the fault of the person behind me I'm guessing she had as much foot room as I did which was none once the seat is reclined back.  Not to mention the highlight I saw on the site was about the age restrictions.  The cinama seats, which are only a few of the theaters are 21+ but the Fork and Dine theaters which I was in are 18+ or with a parent. So we had the joy of a 2 year old squeeling most of the movie which the staff (which was numerous) did nothing about.    When the waiter who was friendly took our order and our food arrived about 20 minutes later.  The food was about on par price and quality wise of what you would get from Applebees or TGI Fridays.  We had the potato skins (it had been FOREVER and I was excited to be able to get them without the bacon), I had the margarita pizza, one of the few vegetarian options, which was very greasy. My husband had the chicken fajita wrap which is served with very plain potato chips.  All of it was alright, nothing terrible and nothing fantastic.  About an hour into the movie, as we'd been told, the waiter brought our check over.  Personally I think this is silly what if someone wants to order something else?  About 10 minutes later he comes by to pick up the check which we had not taken care of yet, after all we're watching a movie. He then told me he'd be back in a few minutes to pick it up then.  Personally this was the low point of the evening.  I handed the check to my husband, he took care of it and we simply left.  I hate being rushed out when eating at a normal restaurant but now you're going to interrupt my movie to pay a check when I could order more, and also you can't flip my table I'm going to be here for another hour watching the movie.  I simply couldn't stand to deal with any of it any longer.   Like I said at least it was free, we did the math and our total for the evening would have come to about $70.  Which the experience was no where near worth.  I'm old fashioned I guess, I'll stick to dinner and then a movie."}
{"text":"I liked the concept. Staff was very nice. Food tasted like it was warmed up in a microwave and cold on top and warm on the bottom. After we watched our  movie we wanted to purchase tickets a week in advance for another movie. We went to customer service and asked them if they knew if TinTin would be playing on Weds. (we were there Saturday night). They told us they did not know and we would have to check on Weds. Whaaat? They don't know what movies are playing the following week? I was ticked off... their website is no better. It is confusing and hard to order tickets. I searched for tickets for tomorrow and it says showtimes not available. Sure seems like they don't want anybody to come see any movies. After spending $100 for food and movie I think I will try a different place."}
{"text":"They gave me a diet soda when I cant drink artificial sugar. I asked the guy if he was sure and he said yes. I drank about half of it and then got sick. Regrettable to say the least."}
{"text":"Second time going here and this time my friends and I accidentally ended up paying for the prime experience with the ability to do a full recline, not seeing the people in front of us because we were on sort of a private row (went to a 3 pm showing and tickets were $12 a piece). We hoped to get there in time for a beer at the bar but ended up needed to go right to the theater but fairly quickly got service and ordered drinks (I had a local San-Tan IPA which was great), along with a veggie platter and an order of hot wings. I find the wings to be great though we were not provided with an extra plate on which to put the detritus of wing eating, the gnawed upon bones but oh well...I was so delighted to find I could make my seat do a full layout that I didn't care and the sound and video quality in the theater house was excellent.  As others have mentioned, I love the reserved seating aspect and I'll be certain to come back. Oh, and when you come out they have a group employees greeting you and thanking you for coming and they have a tray of chocolate mints you can take advantage of as you walk out of the theater house, nice touch!"}
{"text":"Best way to watch a movie! Food and drinks were fairly priced and so yummy. Seats were super comfortable. I will defiantly be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Went to AMC this past week and had a mindblowing experience. I had ordered 2 margaritas for my grandparents that were in town visiting. The server brought our drinks everything seemed fine until she came back and interrupted not only us but the people around us. She wanted to take my 68 year old grandmas margarita, because she didn't have her ID on her. We asked for a manager to make an exception given her age, which was denied. She was very rude throughout the process and took the drink and walked away. At the end of the movie we waited an extra 10 minutes to get our check back. She really embarrassed my grandma as there was a lot of attention on us. I will never go back to AMC dine in again as it was not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! The customer was amazing for a first time impression for my family & the food was very delicious. I'll be back for my next's movie. Great job!"}
{"text":"I feel like this theatre was  just brand new top of the line but has fallen apart. The seats were worn out and old. I was also expecting the seats to recline and they do not."}
{"text":"Since my usual habit is to see movies after work, during the last moments of matinee pricing, the advent of theaters-that-serve-real-dinner is extremely welcome.  After years of paying $7 for a small popcorn, I expected real-food prices to be airport-exorbitant... but the dinner menu pricing is roughly comparable to what the same food would cost at a regular restaurant in the neighborhood, possibly even a bit less, since the BIltmore area is muy expensivo.   Seating in the Cinema Suites puts your meal on a generous arm rest, rather than on a table in front of you (as at Studio Movie Grill). I like this set-up a little better for keeping things out of my way when I'm done eating; depending on your need to cut food, you may disagree. Seats are sharply terraced, so one's view is not blocked by servers working the rows in front.  The menu is less \"basic pub food\" and more \"chi-chi Biltmore grill\" than at Studio Movie Grill, though it still sensibly emphasizes food that can be eaten in the dark without undue complications. I've had some sort of panini that was apparently enjoyable but not memorable (with sweet-potato fries, as I think serving sweet-potato fries is required by law in that neighborhood) and then, on another occasion, a lobster pizza that was fabulous. If you can find something to order that strikes you as faintly silly and you wouldn't order it elsewhere, but the price is okay here, that's probably the way to go.  Make sure to validate your parking at the front desk, as the complicated and annoying parking garage otherwise charges rather a lot. Fortunately, I have not yet learned this the hard way."}
{"text":"I still love this theater but it is ridiculous that I spend almost 100 bucks on a movie for 2.   2 tickets, a snack and 2 drinks - YIKES!~~"}
{"text":"Love this place! No waiting in line because you have assigned seating that you get to choose, reclining seats, a meal and most of all grown ups only (21 over suites/alcohol available). No one kicking your seat, talking through the movie or phone screens lighting up from texting.  Is the ticket pricey...Yes, but worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, here's what you want to know first: How are the drinks?  It physically pains me to report that the cocktails at Esplanade's new dinner-and-a-movie theater suck. I guess Spouse and I are spoiled from drinking in gay bars (the gays love a heavy pour) because I could barely taste any booze in the 9 margaritas I devoured. It's also entirely possible my taste buds no longer detect the presence of alcohol in anything other than 190 proof Everclear grain alcohol. It happens.  I'm fairly certain the bartenders here are the same folks who used to serve the popcorn prior to the remodel. I guess since it's a movie theater I expected Tom Cruise to be slinging liquor bottles behind the bar. No, they actually use a shot glass to measure their pour. I know some queen reading this at One Lexington just gasped out loud and had to grab hold of her tomato red Hennessy sofa to keep from falling over. (Seriously, the gays love a heavy pour.)   As for the rest of our theater experience, the food was better than expected. I was prepared for frozen entrees re-heated and served, but it was at least Applebees quality (check out them high standards). I ate a Chicken Quesadilla that was perfectly spiced and paired nicely with my virgin margaritas, but Spouse was less thrilled about his Lime Chicken Sandwich that he called \"just ok\" (I'm good with words, he's got the looks). Quick tip #1: Finger foods are the way to go; the woman next to me cutting into a wedge salad probably missed the first 20 minutes of the movie.  The seats were plush and comfy with plenty of elbow room. The slightly pricier tickets are worth it alone to avoid knocking elbows with some porny stranger who gets twitchy every time Scarlett Johansson appears on screen. Quick tip #2: If you're going in a big group, have one person buy all the tickets online so you get seats together; reserved seating FTW!  Spouse and I love movies so we'll be going back often. Where else are we gonna go, Christown Mall? Oh, the horror. It's just too bad we'll have to continue smuggling in the mini-bar we keep stashed in our glove box.  PS: Contagion - probably not the best choice for our first dinner movie experience. I went straight to the bathroom and washed my hands for 25 minutes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite theaters in the state.  Modern and stylish, awesome bar, awesome stadium seating and I love the Biltmore area.  Ipic style theaters are too pretentious and don't retain the old fashioned movie theater experience like this place has.  I would say though that some of the plush leather seats seem to be cracking a bit and could use an updating."}
{"text":"Per usual a disappointing theater. Dirty bar top with un-bussed dishes. Unable to get a drink from inattentive bartenders. \"Unkept\" bar staff. Sticky theater tables and menus. Probably my last visit"}
{"text":"Comparable to the iPic theater in Scottsdale, but more affordable and less pretentious. My new go-to!"}
{"text":"It's 1044pm...movoe starts 1045pm the thing is still up and workers are not done cleaning. Unacceptable.  Typically this is our go to theatre and everything is nice...tonight were slackers working."}
{"text":"Once you attend a movie here, it's very unlikely you will go anywhere else! Comfortable seating, seat specific, dine in theater service (you press a red bell and the waiter comes to you) it's the PERFECT dining and movie experience."}
{"text":"I can walk to this place to catch a movie (5 stars on that), but ewww, the food just isn't worth it. Maybe if I'd had a few more drinks and written my review immediately after, the place would have earned a higher rating, but I didn't and so, it earns what it deserves.   I did enjoy the comfort of the big seat, and the second time here, I didn't order anything to eat, which made my whole experience a lot better.   The whole idea, however, behind \"dine-in\" is to EAT, right? Why go watch a movie at a dine-in theatre if I'm not going to EAT?"}
{"text":"The new menu is so bad, we used to love watching movies here and enjoyed the food but our last two experiences have been terrible with their new menu. My wife and I are so disappointed, we won't be coming back until they go back to something worth eating. Who wants sushi at a movie theater, they think fancy food done Bad will work. I don't think so. Stick to the original concept that worked maybe desert ridges new dine in offering will be a better fit for us, we will see."}
{"text":"I've been to this theater many times. After reading some of the negative reviews I decided to post my own. The dine-in option at this theater is NOT fine dining, it is convenience food. The food is expensive and not very good. I don't eat meat so there are even fewer options for me. You can't go wrong with their popcorn, it's one size fits all or bring your own snack.  We were at this theater a couple of months ago and a couple brought their young child and their baby. Once the baby started crying they left. I disagree with one review that said this place is not for kids. If an animated kid friendly movie is showing by all means bring your kid along. If it's an adult film leave your kid at home.  We pay a little bit more to come here because the seats are extremely comfortable and my husband can enjoy a beer while enjoying the movie. The staff has always been friendly, courteous and quiet.   Two tickets for a mid week matinee = $21."}
{"text":"I couldn't reserve online though it showed the movie time open. It gave me an error. I tried to call the theater and no one answered. I drove down to find out and the teenager told me it was sold out. Why couldn't they show that online and/or answer the phone.  Elevator was filthy dirty too and fingerprints all over the doors. We left and I will never go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place and the intimacy it gives if you go out with your plus 1. Their food quality is not bad at all and never encountered any issue here. I don't think anything is wrong with the place except parking can be slightly tricky."}
{"text":"I'd rate 4 or 5 stars, but had a bad experience last night. I was anticipating eating an appetizer or something. The shrimp basket looked like just the right amount, but then I saw the price: nearly $20!! So I started mulling over smaller, simpler options. A waiter/staff approached me (I didn't have my service request light on) and asked me if I wanted some water or a soft drink, I was actually pretty thirsty as I'd just had a workout, so I said, \"Water would be nice!\" I wasn't going to buy anything yet, but I did want the extra time to consider my options, *with* some water in my body, first. He mumbled something and then said, \"Let me know if you need anything else.\" The way he mumbled and the way he said that last bit, I sat there betting he wouldn't return with water, not without me actually ordering something.  Well that's not how it works, buddy, and that's why I'm here posting a negative review. You offered water. I didn't signal to request water. You took the initiative, you set my mouth on fire looking forward to water, you didn't bring it because you wanted a guaranteed tip. NO TIP FOR YOU. I genuinely would have considered ordering something if you had brought me my water first. And despite an eventual slight craving I abstained from giving you any patronage out of principle.  The setting and seats are very nice here and very clean. The online seat selection doesn't have proper proportions of screen; I was in a 3D movie and the screen wasn't nearly as wide as suggested. Not bad, though, just normal, and the sound levels were just right too. The 3D viewing wasn't super low FPS or whatever, so no headaches, good comfortable viewing. Extra star."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with some friends and had a great experience! I was worried it would be odd seeing a movie with people walking around serving food, but they do a great job and not disturbing the movie watching process! Service was super quick, and I can not say enough kind things about my server Bailey!  She was so attentive and helpful! And since it was our first time, she did a great job at explaining how things work! I hope to go back soon, and I will definitely request Bailey!"}
{"text":"Have been here one time previously and had a great time however this time was a disaster!  We usually try and hit the movies at least once a week and mainly go to the Ipic in North Scottsdale but they didn't offer a movie at the time we wanted.   As our second choice we decided on AMC esplanade 14, bad move!   We ordered and app  and entree as well as some wine and tequila shots at the start of the movie.  The wine and shots came in about 10 minutes, the food we thought we ordered came about 45 minutes later which wasn't even what we ordered.  Instead of potato skins and a burger they brought chicken tenders?  We then tried to get the waitress's attention which took another 15 minutes, after she came to take the wrong food away she said the kitchen was now closed and we would not be able to get the food we ordered.  At this point we are well over and hour into a 3 hour movie which we planed to enjoy and also grab dinner, however, we left hungry and upset not to mention going to have to watch the movie again since a good portion was missed trying to figure out how and why a movie theater with 6 people in it couldn't ever have service as poorly as what was experienced during this showing, Service is poor, seats were dirty,  not a good experience!  Sorry AMC if you are going to try a service movie theater you have a long ways to go!"}
{"text":"I went yesterday evening to watch a film and have a little dinner. At approximately 610 pm I ordered a beer and a salad and settled in to watch the movie. My beer arrived at 711! An hour later for a beer!!! I asked about my salad and the girl that served my beer said they had to have the order sent out ??? Whatever that means.  My waitress arrived another 20 min later to give me my bill when I told her that my salad never arrived and my beer was served an hour later. She did remove the salad from my bill and offered a tub of popcorn! Really?   Awful service but the movie was good. I won't be going back. There are far too many theatres in the phoenix area that offer far better service."}
{"text":"It's so nice!!!! We sat in the 21+ theater and they had super nice love seats with recliner, a table and then a side area that you can out your purse if needed. Very plush seats. The best part is you only pay $12 a ticket! So affordable for a really nice theater!"}
{"text":"We had problems booking through fandango so I really do recommend just using the amc app if you use any app to buy tickets or try your luck at buying tickets when you get there but just a warning you pick your seats that you buy and they are assigned and go fast so don't show up 10 minutes before on the day a movie is released and expect to sit wherever because that won't happen. My husband and I LOVE the cinema suites because the seats are like sofas so we can cuddle up and be comfortable like we are at home. Cinema suites is 21 and up because you are able to order alcohol and fork and screen is 18 and up. We prefer esplanade over a regular amc because we don't have to worry about younger kids disrupting the movie. (don't get me wrong we love kids and have one but its nice to enjoy a movie without interruption) the food here is actually not bad and its nice to eat and watch the movie but with Biltmore so close by I'd recommend just having a nice dinner at a restaurant because here its overpriced for the quality. All in all we come here for the peace and extremely comfortable seats just make sure you get tickets early and DON'T get them in the back because when sitting in the seats the low wall blocks some of the screen, poor planning on their part. Also if you are 21+ just go to cinema suites not fork and screen because fork and screen seats honestly aren't much better than regular old theater seats and cinema suites are seriously like private couches. Anyway, with all the fancy additions it is more than a regular theater but its only $12 and regular theaters are $9, the seats and privacy are alone well worth the extra $3 not to mention they serve meals and alcohol if you choose to buy any. PLUS if you have the AMC stubs card you rack up points fast here"}
{"text":"I remember I went to this movie years ago when it was just a regular theater. Then I went back about a year ago and saw the changes, it was awesome! They took the iPic concept which I love! We watched The Vow and reclined and got over prices mediocre tasting food. But I still loved it! So I wanted to have my boyfriend experience it as well since he liked iPic.  We went and got tickets for Safe Haven (I'm a total chick, I know) and I didn't care how expensive the tickets were because I knew what to expect for that price...my expectations were shot to tell! We sat in a theater where the chairs didn't recline and were uncomfortable. And it pissed me off even more that they had waiters in there because that's the reason they were over priced. If I'm gonna be in a regular theater, then I have no problem with standing in line at the concession stand. Needless to say, it was disappointing.   Do yourself a favor and go to iPic."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this theater for a very long time, and the renovations are really impressive. The ticket booth is gone, and instead they have you buy the tickets inside at a machine or the Guest Services (or online). There's a full bar and lounge in the entrance, which was perfect for waiting for our friends to arrive. We couldn't get our tickets right away though, since we wanted to sit with our friends, and the theater does assigned seating. Once we were all together, we were easily able to pay separately but get seats together (on a weekday afternoon).  I saw Young Adult in the Cinema Suites (21+ over), so I can't comment on the regular dine-in theaters, but the cinema suites are really comfortable. They're paired in two's. I did notice, however, that when fully reclined, I was missing part of the bottom of the movie (blocked by a little wall that is behind each row), which might be because I'm short.   The waitress we had was really friendly and nice. I asked her about turning off the light in between the seats, and she suggested putting the black napkin that comes with the silverware over it, which was brilliant and got rid of most of its annoying glare.   We tried the brownie sundae, which was good (hard to get that one wrong). It came out really fast. They brought the check about an hour into the movie, which I think is a bit odd since the movie still had a bit to go.  Overall, I like the changes to the theater, but I'm glad I got to spend my high school years going here without all the fuss and restrictions."}
{"text":"Girl at the ticket counter was condescending and had a poor attitude. I just wanted to go to the theater (as the showing was literally about to start) while her and my mother worked out a refund for a previous showing of Atomic Blonde that we missed. She gave me immense attitude. It started with me saying let's just go as the movie was starting soon and I like seeing the trailers. She decided to be smart about it and was like \"well the trailers haven't even started yet\". I said that it was literally 1:15 pm (when the showing was going to start) and she just rebutted with smart remarks. Then I was asking what seat numbers we were and she said \"theater 9\" and I said \"no, I need the seat numbers\" and she interrupted me with a \"if you'd let me finish honey, I would've told you they're [seat numbers yadda yadda yadda]\". She does not have a Southern accent so it wasn't a cute/endearing or accidental thing. It was dripping with her condescending tone. Any worker who thinks it's okay to call customers \"honey\" condescendingly while interrupting them and serving attitude the whole time they're \"helping\" someone need a severe attitude check. Wish I would've caught her name so I could put it here.   Otherwise, food was eh at best. Got the traditional mac and cheese and it was a little tough/undercooked pasta wise, and then I also got the brownie over the top sundae and the brownie bits were pretty hard instead of soft and chewy. The movie was awesome though and for once the menus and the floor weren't sticky."}
{"text":"I came with my dad and it was pricey and the section we had selected happen to have some damages that had not yet been fixed. However, theater was very cozy. We did not try the food and the pop corn seemed like it had been made earlier that day. Overall, it would be better to go to a regular theater and just eat before going."}
{"text":"This is the only way to see a movie in my opinion.  I've been there twice, and love it. it's not as expensive as I had expected.  Great for date nights, or company outings."}
{"text":"My wife and went to the show last night at AMC Esplanade 14. This was our 1s visit since the remodel. Wow, what an experience! You can select the Fork & Screen theater, or the suites. We saw a movie in the Fork & Screen theater, but the suite is where its at. Fully reclining leather chairs, and full service bar and food through out the movie. I've also been to iPic, and I think AMC has outdone them here with a better price and service! iPic only offers service for the 1st 15 minutes of the show, whereas AMC offers service for the most of the movie. Also worthy of noting is that the Suite theater's are 21 and over. Check it out - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite movie theater, and the only theater that we patronized.  The convenience of online seat reservations, the cozy-sized theater and comfy leather reclining seats, and the varied full-service menu that everyone in my family, including several picky eaters, could find something they liked... these factors made the premium ticket and food prices well worth the cost.  For some inexplicable reason (at least to me), however, this theater recently and drastically changed their menu.  Now, instead of dozens of tasty menu options, the new menu is now primarily burger-oriented.  We've been there twice now since the menu change, and everyone in my family unanimously agrees that the new menu offerings are, frankly, disgusting,.  Even the few things on the new menu that we thought we might still be able to enjoy were just awful (e.g., their \"new\" chicken quesadilla, sushi rolls and the kid's chicken strips).    No more chipotle chicken flatbread sandwiches, salmon, pastas, Parmesan truffle fries, or any of the other tasty entrees that we used to order at this theater.  They're all gone now!  In their place are food items that one might expect to find at the corner \"independently-owned\" bar.  I can't understand the reasoning behind the substitution of a really nice variety of food items with a burger-based menu where every non-burger food item that we've tried has been foul-tasting.  Before, we were happy to pay a premium price for movie tickets and food, and we always looked forward to seeing new movies at the AMC Dine-in Theatres Esplanade 14 at dinnertime.  With this unpalatable and very limited new menu, however, we now plan to eat at restaurants with tasty and varied menus (like this theater used to offer), and then we will go and see a movie at another theater that charges more reasonable prices for tickets.    I don't known who oversaw this recent menu change for AMC, but that person needs to be replaced.  After 5 years as our exclusive/favorite movie theater, we don't plan to return."}
{"text":"$16.20 for an adult ticket and parking is roughly $12.  The theatre is nice, but you can get the same thing at Studio Grill (minus the over priced ticket and inconvenient parking)."}
{"text":"Full experience was a 2.5, food however is a one star.  The seats are very comfortable and you can recline all the way down.  The sound system in this theater is really good, creating a better movie watching experience.  On to the food, we got loaded chipotle chicken chips and tenderloin tips.  Chipotle chicken chips- All the flavor was there however,  the very first bite COLD, chips not crunchy, cheese had been melted but had already set. As I said all the flavor was there but everything else fell flat.    Tenderloin tips- This came with mashed potatoes and broccoli, I was excited for this dish as it was recommended by our waitress but everything tasted like it came from a microwaved dinner. The tenderloin tips were not tender at all and super chewy, mashed potatoes were starchy (like the ones from a mix) and broccoli cold.  I know this isn't a five star restaurant but I expected more from a dine in theater. We went to iPic a couple of weeks ago, the seats and sound were not as amazing but the food was 100X better.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things, maybe it was an off day, we are still in debate to come back a second time or not."}
{"text":"Here's a concept--have a movie theater that serves you dinner at your seat.  Sounds great and I do plan to return here periodically.  However, there are a few dents in the plumbing to bang out.  There are two settings here:  Fork and Screen, and Cinema Suites.  Both are similar, but Fork and Screen is suitable for families, while Cinema Suites seats are adults only.  Know the two well, because Fandango for the iPhone may not tell you this if you are booking seats for your family.  I did so, and ended up with a nasty surprise when I arrived at the theater.  Thankfully, we were able to convert the tickets to Fork and Screen about 2 hours after our original booking time, but it was annoying.  Service in the theater for dinner?  Friendly.  SLOW.  If you want a drink refill or more food, you push a button near your seat to summon the server.  Then you wait 15 minutes or more for the server to come.  Plus, if you are seeing a movie that goes until after midnight, the kitchen shuts down halfway during the picture and you can't even get a drink refill.  It would have been nice to know that this was going to happen beforehand so we could have gotten a last drink.  I like the system and the food is very good, but they need to tighten up their procedures quite a bit.  The food is also, as you would expect from a theater, very expensive.  Snack food and drinks for three cost over $50.  Still fun--good for an occasional movie night.  It's worth having the experience, but know what you are getting yourself into."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this theater for years and have been a few times since they remodeled and changed concept. Most recently was a few weekends ago to see Gravity...   The seats are comfortable enough, and I don't really mind the concept of dine and watch a movie - but then again, maybe I do. I've been to a few other theaters with this format, and I guess I find it kind of distracting and annoying with waiters wandering around. I mean, it has its pluses and minuses.   The food here is okay. In no way is it worth the price you pay, but it's also pretty absurd that regular cheap ass candy is just as expensive here as anywhere else (as others have pointed out), and when proposed next to their \"fancy\" desserts, the price of a box of Dots is ridiculous.   So I get that people make mistakes and everyone has a bad day and all that, but while sitting and trying to watch the movie, the waiter carrying a bag of popcorn to someone behind me dumps the entire thing on my lap, and in my drink and all over my pizza. I don't mind so much... I'm just trying to watch Sandra Bullock float in space. However, he apologizes profusely and asks me what I was eating and drinking... I said \"pizza and a coke zero.\" He takes my food and drink away and says he'll bring me replacements. He leaves me covered in popcorn shrapnel.  Half an hour later, I get a replacement pizza... still no drink. I ask him again for a Diet Coke or Zero... about 15 minutes later, someone else hands me a Coke. Nope. Then another guy comes by and sweeps around me. All of this is REALLY fucking distracting while trying to watch a film. I ask someone else for a Coke Zero or Diet Coke... eventually, I get it.   Then later, the guy bugs me again to give me a bag of popcorn \"on the house\" - uhh... thanks, but if I wanted popcorn, I would've ordered some in the first place. I get it though - nice gesture. I didn't eat any of it.  Then the bill comes and the movie is over. The bill has 2 pizzas on it. I'm like, \"WTF!?\" I didn't even ask for a replacement pizza! We sit around waiting for someone to come by and nothing... I get up and go to find my waiter guy and he's disappeared. A girl who may have been a manager asks me what's up and I unload on her all of the anger and rage I had apparently stored up combined with all the tension and intensity created by the film I had just watched.   She took my bill and said she would remove a pizza... then came back and said to just go ahead and leave without paying because their credit card machines were down. I gave her whatever cash I had on me and split... on the ride home, I decided that was dumb because she probably just pocketed it. Then I figured she probably earned it for listening to me say fuck a bunch of times loudly. Then I went back to wishing I had just left.   They should've offered me my ticket(s) back and comped my drink and removed the extra pizza and apologized... or maybe offered passes to another show. They could've handled it way better than they did. I mean, spilling popcorn on me isn't even a big deal at all - they just kept making it worse and worse. As it stands, I probably won't be back.  And Gravity was fucking top! It was so amazing, though I probably need to see it again without a bunch of bullshit going on around me."}
{"text":"The site to purchase tickets has been down since Dec 25. No one answers the phone when you try and call. Now I am going to Harkins..   Awesome job - AMC..."}
{"text":"First time here. Quite honestly will never go back. Extremely slow service. We ordered drinks and meals before the movie started. I thought it was weird that we never got served. I just thought maybe they would serve us later. Then about 3/4 into the movie we received the check. I thought maybe they just gave you the check before the food but we never received any food. I pushed the little order button for someone to come so I could talk to them and see what was going on. 20 minutes later a lady came to collect the check. I kindly asked why we have not received our food yet. She did not even apologize or mention it. All she said was I will take it off of your check.   When she brought the check back she did not even say anything just set it on my tray and walked away.   It was really hard to enjoy the movie because the whole time my stomach was rumbling and I was thinking of food and I felt anxious.    Parking was super confusing. We cannot get into the lobby and had to walk up to the parking garage because we could not take an elevator and we had to end up paying eight dollars."}
{"text":"Great leather plush seats with full food service. The food are really good too!  The tickets are a bit more than your traditional theaters but you get what you pay for. We often go here for our date nights."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. We waited 20 minutes before finally leaving the movie to get our order and then afterwards wanted to speak with a manager about it and they couldn't find one for us. Really sucks in a dine in theater to have to try to track a server down especially for how pricey the drinks are."}
{"text":"We live in Glendale, so this theater isn't exactly our local neighborhood theater. When we go here, it's planned out in advance and not very often. We've been here twice. The first time we used cinema suites and the second time \"fork and screen.\" The first time was amazing, but then again if you're in a recliner drinking wine watching a movie can you find anything bad with it?   We went back a second time a few weeks ago, this time we ended up in the fork and screen theater. I was disappointed this theater didn't have recliners, but that was my fault for not checking. In my opinion, I would exclusively use this theater for the cinema suites option. Never doing fork and screen again. We had a family sitting by us with a toddler that seemed to not realize they weren't in their own living room, and allowed the child to make all kinds of noise and ruckus throughout the movie. I'm not sure how the staff didn't hear this, because I sure did, but who knows, maybe they did and they just didn't want to say anything. I know I sure wouldn't in this whole \"kiss the customer's ass\" world we live in.   I emailed the manager after we got home and told him about our experience and he apologized and said he'd talk with the staff about how to handle incidents like that.   Either way, if you go to this theater - cinema suites, all the way. They're 21+,  no exceptions which is great if you're like me and it bugs you when people bring kids into not kid appropriate movies."}
{"text":"This place is okay. When you click on the button to call for help, they take forever. The food is okay but it's really pricey."}
{"text":"WOW!!! It's like every seat is first class! There is a server too that comes to check on you. It may bother some people during the movie, so caution on that. There was a food and drink menu and so I ordered the blue moon and was surprised it was served on draft in a cold glass! That's the stuff!!  What I absolutely hated was the parking. It was my first time there and didn't know where to park so I circled around 4-5 times until I parked in the garage. You can have your parking validated at the box office. Once in the garage, it is tough to find the theater entrance. There were no signs and I kept walking toward the amc reflections, but those were reflections! So it was totally the wrong way. I had to ask some strangers where the theater was.   But now I know where to go, it'll be a lot more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"My first experience at a Dine-in Theater! Such a great idea, like seriously this is the connecting link between purchasing foods at concessions and a dining experience at the theater.  I came here with Khoa N. to watch Guardians of the Galaxy and previously booked our tickets online, love how you can choose where your seats are located so you don't have to worry about other people stealing your chair and all that nonsense.  Once seated we looked over our menus and got our orders taken. I had an Appletini and we shared a small order of Onion Rings and Buffalo wings. The drink was good, delicious with that alchy kick. Food is decent, think Applebee's or Red Robin's quality. Overpriced? Hell yeah, but it's the novelty of being served food and eating a full on dish inside a movie theater. Only cons were Khoa's beer glass was luke warm and dirty.   For a dine-in theater I expected it to be a lot louder during the showtime, but the noise level was pretty quiet. Comfy big chairs and alcohol during a movie? Can I get another hell yeah? The service was good, we were served and brought the bill. The servers weren't too distracting either.  If you park in the lot, get your parking ticket validated before you leave it's right by the exit.  Esplandade 14 you have ruined me from watching movies at a regular theater, it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The last three times I have been here the service has been great. The seats clean. The food not so much.   They charge full price for refills, the first soda you get is 75% full of ice. This must recent time I order mac n cheese and the cheese was cold like ice. The noddles were under cooked. Chicken tenders were pink the middle also. I asked for a soda to go and paid anther $6. For two cokes, two refills and one to go I spent $30. I won't be so upset if the menu had told me refills where the same as a full price drink or maybe if my food at been edible.   I tried to give this place a try but after the terrible food and deceiving menu, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"My family and I went to this AMC for the \"Full Meal Deal.\" The theater is located across the street from the upscale Biltmore shopping center in the Esplanade (also high end). Many people are familiar with the crossroads of 24th street and Camelback, as it tends to have a bit of snob appeal.   We parked in the Esplanade garage with the turn in being off of the west side of 24th street. You do need to grab a parking ticket, which will be validated for 4 hours at the theater ticket counter inside the theater, after paying or showing your valid movie tickets. Please make sure your parking is properly validated, as they use Archaic validation machines that forced me to return to the theater after the movie was over. This means I had to go all the way down to the parking garage (with family in tow) and back up to the theater on the second floor of the Esplanade (The escalators are often shut down, as they were Monday night).   The entrance to the theater is nice with a view of the full bar right as you walk in the doors. There are approx 15-20 seats at the bar. I don't imbibe, so cheers to all of you who do. The ticket counter is actually split in two with the bar to your back, yes there's only two lines for tickets. This should come as no surprise, as this theater doesn't have massive amounts of coach seats crammed together. The approach in this theater is to give each movie goer space to eat, as they watch the movie.   Seats in this AMC are not reclining seats, which is why this is a 4 star theater vs a 5 star. The seats are very comfortable and come with a sunken drink holder (very handy) as well as a swiveling tray that your food sits on. Each seat is preset as a table in a restaurant would be, minus any wine glasses, plates or a breadbasket. You will find silverware wrapped in a cloth napkin, along with a main food and dessert menu, full bar menu and a third menu that contains specialty drinks, deserts and monthly food specials. After making your selections simply push the red button over your right or left shoulder, depending on where you're seated.   The experience was a 7 out of 10 and with a few modifications it could be a 10 out of 10. Here's how you fix what's holding this theater back.   When a movie is set to start at 9:00pm and starts at 9:42pm, there's a problem. We've all have grown to accept the obligatory 15-20 minutes of previews, not a marathon of 42 minutes (I'm not kidding). Yes while everyone is ordering and waiting for their food, the trailers play and play, all while the theater is pitch black and everyone is trying to use their cell phones to read the menus. Those who order early, are looking on with contempt at those who are still using their bright cellphone lights and interrupting the punctual movie goers that love their 42 minute trailer viewing experience.  Why not require everyone to preorder their food and be ready to get things going in a timely organized, no cell phone light needed manner? While the movie is playing, why not do what the car companies have done? Simply have the dim lights that allow you to see what's going on when your hands are close to them. This solves the problem with orders during the movie.   The seats are plush and rock back and forth slightly, but as said, THEY DON'T RECLINE! Why can't you make these seats recline? Consolidated Theaters in Hawaii (Specifically \"The Ward Center,\") has reclining seats with swivel trays, copy them and leap forward.   The food was actually not bad. That being said, it wasn't that good either and they were out of several dessert items (even though I should skip dessert).   I really did enjoy the overall experience, but there's absolutely room for change, it needs to happen."}
{"text":"Pro:  -The seats are nicer than a typical harkins theater.   Cons:  -The servers come throughout the movie and don't whisper. It's pretty distracting.  -It would be nice if I could grab a popcorn on the way in. Your only option is ordering anything is in the theater so you have to wait and then tip. It honestly doesn't feel more convenient than just getting it myself.  -Parking garage sucks."}
{"text":"I appreciate the upgrades that have come with the Dine-In Theatre concept.  First, the not-so-good. It is nice that they serve alcohol, but it's incredibly over-priced ($21 for a domestic pitcher). The food is just okay- it's comparable to going to Chili's.   Now the good stuff- If you go before noon, movies are only $6! Also, the Cinema Suites are 21+, so you never have to worry about obnoxious kids or crying babies ruining your cinematic experience."}
{"text":"Hmm. Not sold on the dining theatre experience. Only thing to order before movie is alcohol or coffee. No popcorn until the theater opens, which is usually 30 minutes before movie, however tonight they were running late in cleaning theater so it was only 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with the BF and I've had a great time every time. They have good food and I love how when the armrest is put up it feels like were watching a gigantic tv on our couch in the living room. I love that we get to cuddle up super comfortably and munch on some fries and candy. I learned my lesson about drinking too much before a movie, having no recollection of the movie Immortals, so I have since grown to love the whole movie and (1) drink concept. Love the fact there aren't children and you can reserve your seats. I haven't had any instances of dis-satisfactory service or technical difficulties so I can't give them any less of a rating. The ticket prices are reasonable for all that you get, I definitely think it's worth the extra couple of bucks. It's fairly close to where we live making it more convenient than going to Studio Movie Grill, but I have yet to try UltraStar. Love the french fries here! Will return many times over I'm sure."}
{"text":"Idk why all the haters , I really enjoyed our experience .  Huge recliners , pretty  decent food , great service , no kids running around , I think our theater held less than 50 or so. During  a great movie I almost fell a sleep I was so relaxed . Ya , $23 for tickets for 2 and we spent $46 for two margaritas and an appetizer and two meals, I'd do it again"}
{"text":"Do not go to this theatre. We went on New Year's Eve. We chose seats in the back row several days prior to New Year's Eve. When we arrived at the theatre all of the seats in the back row have a limited view of the screen. If you recline you can only see the top half of the screen.  Even if you do not recline you cannot see the bottom of the screen. When I went to express my concern to the manager he was rude and unconcerned. The only offer was to refund our money if we leave. Leave on New Year's Eve. We planned this in advance and it would have been impossible at this point to even get into a restaurant. It gets worse, the food was ice cold, one staff member literally threw straws at us and we were told she was having a bad day because she was overworked. Worse experience ever. We will never go to this theatre again. Thank you AMC for an awful New Years Eve experience."}
{"text":"Super large plush reclining chairs. The wall railing cut off like the bottom four inches of the screen unless i sat straight up. I also sat on the very back, so the wall may be taller back there?  Service was quick and friendly.  Parmesean fries were potent with the parmesean smell and pretty tasty.  This place is comparable to the studio movie grill.... But a bit more intimate."}
{"text":"Bad food, too salty, got stomach ache, will never dine there again, don't think they try there food before they serve it"}
{"text":"Early movies are $7 and empty.  Service was a little awkward. Either my button didn't work or they were behind on staffing.  Next time I will order a soda from the bar.    Parking is validated for 4 hours."}
{"text":"There is no better way to watch a movie than the Cinema Suites here.  No kids and recliner chairs are the way to go.  Drinks are fine, food menu is better than I would have expected.  It's a bit pricier, but worth it.  Side note - if you want to save some bucks, come for a morning matinee show.  Spend what you'd save otherwise on a Bloody Mary at the bar before you go in.  Worth it!"}
{"text":"LOVE this theatre. Yes, it cost a little more, but the seats are ten times better (although the cinema suites recline and have a leg rest) and you can have lunch/dinner/wine while you enjoy your movie. The screens are huge so any seat you get is going to be good. I usually come to this theatre if I'm watching a movie alone and don't want to be bothered (seats are usually in pairs). I do take my daughter here to watch kid movies (you can only take them in Fork&Dine), but I love it because they have kid's meals and unlike a regular theatre you don't have little kids banging on your seat or screaming. Everyone is rather well behaved. For this, I definitely pay the extra $2 or $3 to watch a movie here."}
{"text":"Must say this is the only way I'll be watching movies from now on. What a great experience. Seats are large and comfortable and well spaced. The Cinema Suites are the best, I just wish they had all the theaters like that.  Only downside is the food is average. Besides that, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The idea of a dine-in movie theater was a great idea when it first came out and the Esplanade was one of the trailblazers for this... unfortunately over the years, the quality and experience has not remained at the same high level it once was.   Parking isn't too bad if you are familiar with the area as the garage offers plenty of spots (when you get past the 2nd floor). AMC was \"trailblazer\" and put other movie theaters on notice who wasn't adjusting to the times and demands of the customers.   Compared to other theaters, the seats are small and do not recline... They rock back and forth but they don't \"recline\" where you can kick up your feet. What's worse is that the seats are closely packed so the extra money your spending for the experience does not include 1st class seating (more like the economy class seats). They do have a swinging table to place your food on but it makes it even more uncomfortable as you feel like your eating your food in the person's lap next to you.   Prior to the movies, we put down a few drinks as expected and that I will say was pretty good. Slightly higher in prices but decent. When it was time to sit down, 1 of the 9 seats we purchased was broken. Luckily we had a no-show so they moved seats. The seats are dated, and they need to make sure they indicated if a seat is damaged to prevent purchasing online.   I have no desire to return unless I'm in the area for the morning tickets that run $5, but even still I'm spending another $20+ for food and drinks. Disappointing as this theater doesn't live up to hype it once was and for the area, it's not meeting the other business high standards. Gotta get better guys!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't see what the hype was about. My friend ordered a drink from the bar and couldn't believe at how much it cost. The seats were fine, but nothing extraordinary. I'd rather hit up a Harkins to be honest. Not worth the extra few bucks."}
{"text":"I have never been to a theater with food delivered to your seat! Comfortable, reclining leather seating,  And terrific service to boot!  A little more expensive the traditional theaters, but worth the splurge. You are definitely spoiled!!"}
{"text":"I am an AMC Stubs Premiere member, so I have been to my share of AMC's. This place just jumped to the top of my list.   1. They have a full bar 2. They came to my seat to take my order 3. The guy who served us was friendly and had personality 4. They have a full bar  I get tired of only beer and wine options when I watch a movie. So a full bar is crucial to my movie-going experience. They are overpriced (what movie theater isn't). It was a bit distracting to talking to your server while watching a movie. I might have missed some key parts of the movie. But I thought they handled it as best as they could for what it was worth.   The one thing that was missing was the recliners. They have rocking loungers...... Um, no.   Also, I don't know what is going on with their parking situation, but half of my group had trouble finding parking. They could make it a little easier."}
{"text":"Amazing place. We are from Washington so this was our first AMC experience and it was excellent. Love how you just push a button on your seat and the server brings you everything. The wait on the popcorn was a little long comparative to getting our other food and drinks. They even validated 4hrs of parking from the garage."}
{"text":"The Esplanade is a decent movie theater to go to.  We are currently in a bit of a fight though, as they've decided to stop selling Snickers Popables.  It might not be entirely their fault, maybe more of a corporate decision, but I think I'm going to start sneaking my own treats in after that slap in the face.  Besides disagreeing as to acceptable movie snacks (they replaced the Popables with Goldfish crackers), I'll usually choose this theater over others, if only for it's proximity to my house and the mostly civilized crowd.  I find less screaming babies in R-rated movies at this theater than at, say, AMC Arizona Center.  Sometimes you get some annoying, giggly teens and pre-teens, which is why post-city-mandated-curfew shows are great.  I never have figured out why they can't seem to solve the problem of the garbage odor though.  It's not always present, but when it is, it's there in full force.  I'm guessing it's the food garbage from the restaurants, but I can't think that their neighbor, the Ritz-Carlton, is a big fan of that stink wafting over.  Some tips:  * If you want to avoid parking lines, park underground.  (This may only be useful after business hours and on weekends.)  If you come in off 24th Street, the entrance to the underground parking is to the right.  It's kind of creepy, but you can usually park right by the elevators and avoid the reeeeeally long lines that occur when almost all 14 theaters let out at the same time.  * If you're afraid to park underground, simply go downstairs and get an ice cream/coffee/pastry/drink at one of the restaurants and bars on the ground level.  By the time you get your food or drink and get back to your car, you've most likely avoided the line.  Don't be too leisurely though, or you'll catch the next exodus and the circle will start all over again.  * If you take the stairs, make sure you make note of which side of the stairs you came up.  There are two sets on each side of the theater and if you go down the wrong side, the entrance to your floor will be a non-descript little door rather than the wide open double-doored entrance that you recognize."}
{"text":"What would it take to spray some grease on your  screechy seats? Seriously wd40 or some butter maybe, I don't care but, I give this place one star because I didn't have  the only noisy seat. I couldn't follow along with the movie.  My wife kept getting kicked because the 3D theatre is cramped. Servers where extremely nice. I hope they are making $16+/hr.  And your escalators, please fix your escalators outside . It seems they are always broken and I've been here 3-4 times, not impressed. I will be going to camel view if I ever want to see another movie"}
{"text":"The quick of it:  I went to see the Conjuring 2 and the movie was a great horror/suspense film. The picture quality was fine and the sound was really good! These are the only positive things I can say about my experience. The staff was very slow to come take our order and the theater was pretty trashed. The experience they claim you'll experience falls short and doesn't hit the mark. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up and onto another of the many theaters in the area.  STOP reading unless you really want the specifics: I was really looking forward to checking this place out since I've been to several similar theaters throughout the country however the moment I got there the seats weren't torn but they had popcorn in the sides of the seat cushion, the upper head portion of the recliner had a very certain greasy type of hair product or perhaps sweat funk of some kind. I then found a fake eyelash in the cup holder barf*  I suppose all of this isn't a really big deal all in all but then things got worse.....  I notified the staff that was congregating right outside the theater door and i was told \"yeah that sometimes happens, we try to clean it up as best we can but we clean and vacuum better at the end of the night\". I then asked for a clorox wipe or something so that I could at least tidy up (thinking he would offer to send someone) but I was told he only had a damp rag he could give me use (so I did!).   I ordered a water and a Lagunitas IPA and it took them 29 minutes to bring me the beer (not the water. I know the time because after it took them a very long time to answer the call button I looked at my watch when I ordered the beer and water). The beer was not very cold and I walked out to the bar myself to get my own water and came back in less than 5 minutes.  On my way in the staff was gaggling around the computer/register at the back of the theater and I asked if they could put a food order of chicken tenders in for me.   The food came much quicker than the beer took but it was terrible. The chicken tenders were in a very salty breading and 2 of the 4 or so pieces I had to spit out because the chicken was so rubbery or almost as if the piece was made of a large nerve or something. I also ordered it with BBQ sauce and they served it with the default ranch and honey mustard anyway.   The staff had a very indifferent type of vibe and the service was pretty bad. They were loud during the movie and would laugh or make noise in the rear of the theater that would snatch you out of the movie experience. The lights that illuminate near the call button are also at about shoulder level and are a bit to bright if you're used to a traditionally dark theater.   The added cost just isn't worth coming here to watch a movie. If you're just looking to catch a must see flick and you have to come here I STRONGLY recommend you order your drinks from the bar yourself and order a popcorn/candy from the server but no more!"}
{"text":"First of all, the parking is difficult. I've only been to the Esplanade a couple of times before, but there is so much \"reserved\" parking, that it's difficult to find a visitor space, much less park anywhere near the theater. I do however appreciate that AMC validates for a 4 hour time frame, so that easily covers the movie/dinner experience.  We stopped by on Monday, for an 11:15 am showing. Got in pretty fast, got seated, had our meals picked out by 11, pushed the buttons and by 11:10, still no waiter. My husband went out looking for someone, there was no one in sight. Finally, just a minute before the movie was to start, the waitress hurried in and said there were 4 movies starting at the same time and only 2 people in the waitstaff. From there, things didn't get a lot better: they mixed up our drinks (easily solved, we switched). They mixed up our food (in the dark, we never did figure out whose was whose, since we both picked a different quesadilla) but it tasted ok. I tried to get a refill on my iced tea, but that took another 15 minutes. Ultimately the only thing that moved quickly was the bill.  My experience with dine-in theaters is limited to Scottsdale's Studio Movie Grill. Their food isn't that great, I would say AMC Esplanade is much better in that regard. Esplanade is also cleaner, but hands down SMG has better service. I might try Esplanade again to see if this is a weekday thing, but I feel that a business should be consistent."}
{"text":"I am officially in love with AMC Esplanade!  I love the comfort of seeing a moving in a reclining chair.  I have been to this location several times and I have not been disappointed.  The staff are super friendly and are quick to help.  The last time I was in to see Wolverine, my chair would not recline.  A Manager came over and tried to resolve the problem.  Unfortunately the chair could not be fixed but I was given two movie passes for my next visit.  This didn't ruin my movie experience.    AMC Esplanade has a great menu with lots of items to choose from.  They have the usually candy, popcorn and Coke.  But they also have a full menu that includes appetizers, sandwiches, pizzas, desserts and a full bar.  The Thai Bang Shrimp appetizer is a great bit for the movie.  This order has crisped golden shrimp with a zesty Thai bang sauce.  I don't know what this sauce is but it's delicious.  They offer the Thai Bang Shrimp Taco and they come with chips and salsa.  I recommend the Thai Coconut Chicken Tenders and add the Parmesan fries.  The tenders will come several sauces but the Thai coconut red chili glaze was my favorite.    The prices are a little higher than a regular theater but you pay for what you get.  If you want to see a movie in comfort, I highly recommend AMC Esplanade.  The price is worth the comfort."}
{"text":"I love this place.the seating is awesome and it really feels like a night out when you can watch a good movie, be comfortable , have tons of leg room and get some amazing mac and cheese all in one place.It is a movie experience thst will make you wonder why all theaters arnt this way ...dine and watch!"}
{"text":"I took my wife there to see we bought a zoo, the movie was great and this place unbelievable. it was the best movie going experience i have ever had. they bring your drinks and food to you and you get to pick your seats before you go in there and it is on a really nice neighborhood too. i totally suggest this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Probably the nicest dine-in theater I've been too.  I have been to the Alamo Draft-house in San Antonio and the Roadhouse Cinemas we have in Tucson, and this one is the best.  The food is pretty good and the seating is spacious, which I like.  It is pricey, but then again so are all of these theaters with this concept.  Parking was difficult, but at least they validate your parking so you don't pay.  The wife and I had a good time, so we'll be back nice time we drive up to Phoenix."}
{"text":"My food arrived during previews with no drinks. 15 min later still no beverages still watching previews. Walked out theatre to the bar and got some waters missing the only 2 previews I got here early for. Movie just began and now our drinks arrive. One of us has no food left and mine is cold. Not spending money here again"}
{"text":"My other half & I decided to give Esplanade another try after not returning for quite some time. In the beginning, we thought it was really cool to have dinner while watching a movie in fancy reclining seats with no kids around, but then after multiple foodservice experiences that really distracted from the movie, it became more trouble than it was worth. But it had been awhile so we decided to give it another go and went to see The Jungle Book at Fork & Screen. When we arrived, our theater was still being cleaned so we were unable to go in until about 10-15 minutes before the movie started. The menu was different. Seemed like fewer options to choose from. I was considering the Southwest Chicken Bowl and asked our server if it was possible to get white rice instead of brown. He wasn't sure and when he pulled it up on his tablet, the Southwest Chicken wasn't even available. So I went with a plain Cheeseburger & fries. My other half was smart and ordered 4 waters for the 2 of us so we wouldn't have to push the button and wait for refills during the movie. My burger patty was so well done, it was crunchy. Just thin & dry, no juiciness to it at all. I used to get burgers here and I don't remember them being like that... The fries were pretty boring, a little salty. I used to enjoy their parmesan fries. While I did enjoy the movie, the meal was a disappointment and does not make me want to return."}
{"text":"Love this place! First time I've been to a \"dine-in theater\" and it was the best experience! Very friendly staff! The seating is extremely comfortable and cozy! It's like being in the comfort of my own home :)"}
{"text":"....holy cripes is this place expensive.  I have to say I dig the free parking, plush seating, and great screens/sounds, but at $15 per person for a 3d screening for of Wreck-It-Ralph I don't understand how this place is affordable for a family of four - even for myself that seemed outlandish."}
{"text":"Horrendous service, poor management and terrible attitudes ran this theater on a pathetic Wednesday evening. The stars were aligned for this one.   1.) I am house sitting for a friend who leaves for vacation tonight. I had just picked up his keys before my girlfriend and I took another friend to the movies for his birthday. The vacation friend needed his keys back from me but I would be in the movie by the time he got to the theater. I asked the box office employee if they wouldn't mind putting the keys behind the counter so I wouldn't need to leave the theater mid movie. He simply said, yeah I can't do that. I asked him if he wouldn't mind asking a manager. So this kid walks away and walkies his manager, them comes back and tells us \"yeah we don't do that.\" I find the manager on my own and ask why not and if an exception can be made. He is very smug when he flatly says that it's their policy. I tell him that I understand policy but it would have been nice if the desk clerk would have explained that it was a policy instead of saying that he wouldn't do it and didn't seem to have any concern or desire to help me. Very poor customer service as well as attitude and lack of professionalism from the staff's management.  2.) The wait staff was terribly slow. I would be fine if it were slow and we got even the simplest apology even if it weren't heartfelt but no such luck. I timed the server on two of four occasions that I lit up my call button and it took 12 minutes and 17 minutes. I would understand if they were super busy but there were maybe 30 people in the theater. That's INSANE. Then not only does our server take forever to answer the lit up call button, but through the evening, I saw 4 different people. Not one asked if we needed anything else and not one took away dishes that we were clearly finished with. That is until the original waitress comes by to see if we have payment ready for the check she dropped off. Of course, NOW you want to be attentive.  There were other little things like unclean bathrooms and all around unfriendly, discourteous staff but the first two were enough. I come from many jobs in customer service so perhaps my standard is high, but not unreasonable. Without customers, this place doesn't exist. You'd think that they would care more about our experience as clients of the theater. I've been to AMC theaters in the valley and never had an issue until now. This specific theater will never receive my business again and I will vehemently recommend against them if any such opportunity arises. I truly hope someone fixes this theater and their staff.  Do yourself a favor and visit a different theater, AMC or otherwise."}
{"text":"Okay... I reeeeeeally want like this idea. It would probably work if patrons exhibited any shred of common decency. However, seeing as how Mr. & Mrs. Douchebag can't figure out how to get to the theatre on time I guess I shouldn't expect them to whisper their order to the waitress while the movie is running. I also probably shouldn't expect them to not get drunk during the movie either. Since you get both full restaurant & bar treats served directly to your movie seat, rude people easily forget they aren't watching the movie in their home alone. I've gone twice & there was just too much noise for me to relax & enjoy the movie. That having been said, the staff has been really helpful & friendly & the seats are pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I'm an easy going person and there are few things that'll make me give less than 4 stars. The food was great, prices were decent, movie was excellent.   My only complaint is that when I paid my tab I put $40 in for a $30 tab. The waitress never came back with my change. I had to ask another waitress to find my waitress and have her return my money.   When my waitress came back, she replied with \"Oh, you wanted change?\"   Well yes, I would like to decide what sort of tip I give you, with the hard earned money that I make.  I spoke to a manager, explaining what happened and he didn't seem interested in the slightest.   Bottom line, just pay with a card. Customer service isn't phenomenal but typically I never have to deal with them at a movie theater."}
{"text":"Weekly ritual to go see movies at this theatre! Food is good & the Suite theatres are amazing! The only thing lacking is the website to purchase tix always seems to be down & there aren't a whole lot of showtimes available (even for new movies.) always purchase tix ahead of time to make sure you get good seats!"}
{"text":"Terribly designed!  This is the worst designed eat and watch luxury theatre I have ever been too.  The ledge is too high, so that if you recline your seat 25% of the movie is cut off!!  I had to sit on the edge of the seat and on my tippie toes to see subtitles.  Experience ruined, and couldn't take advantage of all the nice stuff that they did put in there."}
{"text":"Consider yourselves warned. This theater has truly gone to shit in the last 3 years since I've been coming here. The seats are cracked and disgusting, the menu has been slashed (many options are now gone), and the employees have no discernible customer service skills.  I would hope management sees this post and realizes just how far you've driven this theater into the ground. What could have been considered a \"luxury\" theater in the past is now an unholy shithole.   I will be doing my damnedest to avoid this theater in the future, and highly encourage everyone else to do the same.  As an alternative, the new Harkins Camelview in Fashion Square or the AMC Centerpoint in Tempe are heads and shoulders above this crackhouse disguised as a cinema."}
{"text":"Great for dates. Terrific way to watch a movie. The waiters and waitresses are quiet when assisting as to not interrupt the movie. Very comfortable amenities:-)"}
{"text":"NOT FOR KIDS!!! And if only, they would let customers know CLEARLY on their website.  That no kids are allowed. And that means an 18-year old or a 14-year old are not allowed to attend the theater!   Additionally, because it is all twenty-somethings getting drunk and being obnoxious, you can expect to be annoyed, that is, if you are not obnoxious and boisterous yourself!  Also parking is a MAJOR pain in an overcrowded parking garage.  Be sure to bring in your ticket to get validated!!!"}
{"text":"We had no idea how this place worked. The movie we saw was hilarious, and how great to watch it while relaxing in comfort?  However, the food was terrible. Save your money. We had the blue cheese wedge salad and lime chicken burger. The wedge salad was three chunks of iceberg lettuce. The menu doesn't cater to people who are trying to eat in a healthy way. Fried this, fried that.   Go here if you want to watch a movie in comfort, perhaps having a drink, after you have had dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"The wife and I went to this theatre to see 3 Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MO this past Sunday only because the movie wasn't been shown anywhere in the city of Tempe where we reside. I am all about the dining option in the theatres but I do believe this place is trying a bit too hard.  You only have one popcorn size option which is very annoying because everyone doesn't need a 3lb bucket with butter on the side which can only be ordered through the server which is kinda annoying you don't have the option to go a counter.  The time listed on the movie was 11:45, the previews didn't start till 12:30pm since they theatre was down some employees and I'm assuming they won't start the movie till all the shrimp/steak bowls and flatbread pizza is served.  Lastly, the seats are very cramped together leg room wise which wasn't the best for my pregnant wife.  Not trying to sound like a turd, we can be boujee, but I would rather be boujee at Studio Movie Grille, they do it the right way."}
{"text":"Our experience here today was terrible, we went to watch Super Fly and we were the only couple in the theatre we thought what could go wrong? We have privacy and this movie is going to be awesome, we walked in with a drink so we figure were good for a while and then the drink was gone. We were in the movie theatre watching previews for 15-20 minutes, we pressed 3 buttons to get assistance and no one ever came. I told my husband this is ridiculous so I went and found a manager and she had someone come in and take our order. Order came quick but then everything went bad again, we pressed the button and no one came for about 15 minutes. I loved the movie, the experience was terrible and for that reason I will not be returning, I rather go to the Alamo where they constantly check on you."}
{"text":"Ever see or hear of the movie '50/50'? Well, I would've loved to have seen that movie at the AMC Esplanade 14 Fork & Screen \"experience\" because that was the \"experience\" I had there: 50% good and 50% terrible.  It all started good - that's the 50%. The waiter Scotty was awesome upfront, the price of the ticket affordable and the food was very good - I had the classic Chicken quesadilla, Parmesan fries and a \"supposedly\" free-refillable Cherry Coke. The screen and sound were good and so was the idea of having someone come when you needed them by a press of a service button. I'll tell you the truth: I rarely go to the movies these days and it's mostly because of the inconsiderate jerks who use their cell phones, held up as high and bright as possible, to text. Granted, I was literally the only other one in the theatre this time, but I was very prepared to press the button and get anyone kicked out who attempted to ruin yet another good time with their selfish texting.  Ok...and here's the 50% bad part: the plastic/barely rocking chairs were uncomfortable after awhile. I ran out of my soda 30 minutes into the showing and I pressed the button. Scotty had not returned. I thought maybe it was broken, so after 10 minutes, I turned it off and on again. Still no Scotty. Finally 30 minutes later he came back with the bill and sternly told me to turn off the button as if it was bothering him the whole time. Uh...#1 it wouldn't be bothering you if you came within, say those first 10 minutes and #2 isn't this the perk of being at this theatre?  In addition, he didn't give me a pen to sign the receipt. I wasn't about to use the useless button again, so I just left the merchant copy. Only, I thought it appropriate to tip my waiter and I was going to add it using my card on the little \"tip line.\" Finally, I just put a few dollars I had on me in with the bill. Obviously, he didn't come back to get the receipt, so when I left the theatre when the movie was over, I looked for him. He was gone, wherever. In this economy and for someone working for AMC, you'd think he'd want a couple extra bucks for his efforts. (I say the \"working for AMC\" part, because I have worked for the company and I know all about minimum wages and abuse from management.)  So, I took back the tip money, handed the receipt to the bartender and left disappointed. Heck, they didn't even let me keep the plastic Coke cup nor did they honor the menu they publish online: I really wanted the Sicilian Pizzinis but they didn't have it on their hard-copy menu and Scotty know nothing of a \"Pizzinis.\"   Since the \"service\" button is irrelevant and since I can just as easily eat popcorn or eat at a restaurant before/after, I doubt I'll be driving half-way across the city to come back here any time soon."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricy, but it's a nice change to be able to eat a meal or have a beer with your feet up while watching a movie. The cinema suits have the comfy reclining chairs and its 21+.  My fiancé and I do enjoy coming out to the AMC  esplanade for date night and usually have a good time"}
{"text":"This is a service industry. We go to our reserved seats to find the only 2 other folks in the theater are in the seats next to us. I push the service button and Andrew shows up...to assist our neighbors with their order, and then tells us WE are not in his section. In the meantime other folks enter and get served, our neighbors' order shows up and THEN this kid shows up with zero skills. Can't wait to see if he gets the order right. Or if it even shows up."}
{"text":"I love seeing movies here! I refuse to go anywhere else. The cinema suite is the way to go. Reclining in a large comfy leather seat with a glass of wine in hand is now the only way to see a movie. They have servers and if you want something you just push the button on the wall and the server comes right over. They have a good size menu. Desserts and popcorn are good."}
{"text":"We live practically across the street from this place, but we are done with it. When they first reopened with the fine-in experience, their food was actually pretty good and the service was great. Both of these aspects have declined to the point that I HATE the food. There are several restaurants they should be partnering with because they don't know how to run a kitchen.  On second thought, they should also partner with another theater because they don't know how to do that either.   Here is what you can expect:  Your experience will start with waiting 10-20 minutes for someone to take your order. Then, you will be distracted because the movie is supposed to start. But, it's not. You will sit through commercials for 10-15 minutes. Not previews for movies that are coming up, but commercials. Those things you fast forward through at home have been forced on you at the movies.    20 minutes later, you will get excited because your order is coming. The server will approach you and begin to loudly call out what is on their tray. This will happen during the first 20 minutes if the movie. Unfortunately, it will not be yours because while you were able to find your seats based off of the number/letter combination, they have no idea how to use it to bring you your correct order.   You will finally get your food, but you will be interrupted a few more times as other servers try to bring you things you did not order. I promise this will happen to you. It happens every single time I am there.   They will bring you your check during the climax of the movie, just to be sure that they thoroughly ruin your experience.   Don't say you weren't warned. There are several other reviews saying the exact same thing.   The new Camelview is farther, and we have to drive but when I go to the movies I want to have a good time. It's worth the drive to me. Update:     I sent comments to the corporate offices, and they obviously care very much. Just look at the wonderful response that I received:  Thank you for submitting your suggestion to help improve the guest experience at AMC Theatres. We truly value your feedback and will review with the appropriate team(s).  Sincerely,  Rick Reavey Manager, Guest Services"}
{"text":"Employees look mad all the time or act like they don't see you when you need to check in. I have sat in some seats where a nail was sticking out of the cup holder, so when you put your cup in the cup holder, guess what?... it spills on you. The theatre has changed auditoriums for movies last minute causing employees to not know what they are supposed to do. Each time I order a burger, they burn it and it gets remade. I have been to this movie theater several times and really wanted to enjoy the experience because of how close it is to me. You can only be optimistic so many times, only to be let down. Go to Harkins instead."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews you would think Satan lived here but it's a nice place! You get parking validation at the front desk so you don't have to pay anything for that. I had the traditional mac and it was really good. The food got there before the movie even started. It is expensive but a cool experience! There was 3 of us on a Sunday and it cost 70-80$"}
{"text":"And open letter to the Esplanade Theaters:  Dear Mr. or Ms. Esplanade I enjoy your theaters. They are close to my home. And close to many restaurants and shops. Although I have to say the actual shops and restaurants at the Esplanade. Well, they suck. Except for Houstons. The choices of businesses and the horrible signage sends everyone scurring across the street. Yea, that's right. To the Biltmore. Just thought you should know. Your seats are comfortable and generally pretty dang clean. And your crazy concession prices. I don't even mind. It's like the crazy drink prices at the airport. I always expect it and actually enjoy overspending for some strange reason. Just part of the experience I guess.  I really just have one other thing to say Esplanade people: FIX THOSE DAMN ESCALATORS!!!!! IF I WAS LOOKING FOR A FREAKIN HIKE BEFORE AND AFTER MY MOVIE I'D GO TO CAMELBACK MOUNTAIN!  Thank you for your time.  Most Sincerely, Thomas S."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! They didn't remove empty plates for an hour. Brought us 2nd round of drinks over 20 minutes of ordering and didn't take empty glasses.  I actually left the movie to see what was going on. Everything on the little table was piled up. Screwed up bill and tried to fix it with me during the finale of movie (last 5 minutes). They're supposed to be great reclining chairs. But, they were held together by red duct tape.  WTF!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite theater in the valley.  The reclining seats are great, the food is good, and the service is usually quite nice.  I was prompted to write this as I just refunded my tickets and it was easy and the service person was most pleasant and efficient.  I would be ideal if the process was online, but if one call and a quick resolution is the requirement, I can't complain.  And if you ever have to watch a kids movie that doesn't appeal to you, getting a glass of wine in the process is not a bad way to go :-)"}
{"text":"Purchased tickets online in advance and arrived early to eat. Sign on the door, not online but taped to the door, no kitchen available. Ridiculous. The point of a Dine-in theatre is to DINE. When manager was asked why AMC's website didn't notify customers that their kitchen ovens were down and had been since Christmas he claimed that AMC \"doesn't own or control its website.\"  More ridiculous. The story then changed to we'll have a kitchen later this afternoon when the prep work is done. What?  Piss poor service and experience. Harkins - they don't promise what they can't deliver."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while. Walked into the theater and my heart hurt. The place is so worn out. Chairs are all cracked and are not as comfortable as they were. Service and food is still good, but come on AMC, where is your pride. So so sad."}
{"text":"One of the best movie theaters I have been to in a long long time.  When its 115 degrees outside, nothing beats sitting in an air conditioned theater.  My buddy and I went here twice during our stay.  We saw Inception and Cyrus.  Both decent flicks by the way.  5 stars.  That's right!  Know why?  $5.25 to get in.  That is unheard of.  I worked at a movie theater back in the day and those were the matinee prices THEN.  Here they are still that cheap.  That is awesome!   The theaters were really nice and they had multi levels in them.  We sat in the middle level for both movies.  There is nothing in front of you so you can stretch out your legs if you want.  The seats were comfortable and everyone we encountered was nice and friendly.  They also validate parking too which is awesome!  Overall a great theater!"}
{"text":"I know there are a lot of other great reviews on here about this theater and I agree that the dinner theater experience is fantastic. They give free refills on soda and popcorn (although they are awfully slow at it as others have pointed out), and it was wonderful to reserve seats ahead of time. However, the leather chairs were awful! We went twice while I was home and my mom and I both felt the same. The first time we thought it was just because we sat in one of the lower rows, but the 2nd time going (just to give it another chance) was the same. They are not cozy, very stiff, and the lumbar section actually hurt my lower back. Additionally, maybe because I am shorter person (5'3\"), I could not put my feet on the ground so my legs were dangling unless I sat Indian-style (criss-cross applesauce for you PC people out there). For me, it is now a search to find a similar type theater with more comfy seats!"}
{"text":"We love the Esplande 14. In fact, we call it \"our\" theater and have a hard time going anywhere else. Its clean, great staff complete with tasty movie theater treats. And, its a great theater if you're looking to make a good old fashioned date night this is the place for you... great restaurant and bar options within walking distance to the theater. We often get Stingray for happy hour at the Biltmore and then walk over to the theater."}
{"text":"Alright, I tried this theater one more time and am so glad I did.  It was a very different experience this time so I have to update my review.  I went with my boyfriend to see The Heat (which was awesome, too).  The popcorn was spectacular this time!!!  I was so excited and it tasted so good that I ordered a refill.  Woo hoo!!  I did not order the unsweetened tea (which wasn't good the two times I previously ordered it), but instead ordered the sweetened raspberry tea.  It was also very good.  And, just because we were uber hungry, we ordered some of their parmesan fries from the appetizer menu.  They were amazing.  I mean, they were really, really amazing!  Everything about this movie experience was wonderful and exactly what I've been wanting all along.  Thank you to AMC for correcting the former issues and making this the 5 Star experience I've been wanting.  I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this theater. Senior (daytime) is 6.50, we had reserved seats (recliners) with full menu, food brought right to your seats. Food was great and so was the service."}
{"text":"It's not a local theater it's a national chain.  I prefer to support my local Harkins.  I do like the new food options and actually the prices are not bad.  If you go here see the movie in the over 21 theaters they serve alcohol and the seats are a little more comfortable."}
{"text":"Today was our first time at the AMC Dine-In theatre. We were excited to try something new and it is a neat idea for sure, but I feel the price just isn't worth it. With only 8 people in the theatre room that we were in, 4 of the people being in our party.. The service should have been better, we waited long intervals after pushing the light for service and items were forgotten. The food was cold, overpriced, and bland. The mixed drinks are WAY overpriced and could've been better. We probably won't go again and that's disappointing."}
{"text":"Took my wife to the dine in theaters here twice in the past few weeks. Both times we had a pretty good experience. Food is decent. We ordered the nachos and some popcorn. Popcorn was expensive (8.75) but they give you a very large bucket. The nachos were $10 and it was also a pretty big portion. I like the black beans, pico, and guac on the nachos. Wish there wasn't the processed nacho liquid cheese, but the fresh toppings distract from that. Also free refills on drinks is a good perk!   Service is decent. The first time we went there was a long wait for our food and drinks, but we were in a larger theater. The second time we were in a smaller theater and service was very quick.   Reclining seats, pretty comfortable. One complaint, although it's not a huge problem, is that the trays aren't made to go all the way across your chair such that it would be easy to share with your neighbor. My wife had to hold the plate of nachos so that I could share some. Would be nice if there were trays that go all the way across so it's easier to slide food back and forth and share with each other.   Overall nice theater! We'll be back."}
{"text":"We like coming here for dinner and a movie and we sometimes bring family and/or friends. The seating is pre purchased and assigned, and very comfortable. The food is quite good. We share orders of Parmesan fries, and chicken tenders, and bottomless popcorn. The parking is validated, covered, and convenient. Sure you pay a little bit more than you would for fast food and a movie, but the seating, the food and the facility make for a fulfilling experience."}
{"text":"The food is actually really yummy. My daughter and I ordered nachos and my fiance ordered the pretzel bites. Both very yummy. For an entre I had the taco trio (1 shrimp, 1 salmon maybe?...and one chicken). The fish tasted very fresh. The only thing I didn't really like was that the seats didn't recline and it was so dark 40 mins before the previews even started, I couldn't read my menu. Our waitress seemed like she was ready to leap off the tallest building she could find. I really feel for her, being a waitress is no easy task, but I found myself looking longingly at the other smiling, friendly wait staff. I almost hated to press my button to ask her anything. Anyways, if you're in the area it's worth it but if your pleasures lie in comfort, it would be worth the drive to find a better theater for the same price."}
{"text":"We went to an early afternoon show and it was a terribly disappointing experience. This was our first and last visit to AMC Esplanade. Yes, the drinks are weak and sugary and the food isn't great - but we expected that.  We didn't expect a broken escalator with no direction on how else to find your way up to the theatre, a seat that didn't recline and loudly creaked and groaned every time I moved (I'm only 135 lbs!!!), no soap in the bathroom, only half of the sinks in the bathroom functioning, and a dirty toilet stall. The experience was certainly NOT worth the price we paid. One star added for decent service from the staff in the theatre."}
{"text":"The dine in theater here is a lot of fun and a nice option, especially if you are already planning on dinner before a movie.  The quality of the food is just ok, but if you aren't expecting gourmet fancy pants food, it's pretty good.  Our server was attentive and helpful as well.  The price, it can get to you.  $15 for a ticket with fees, $12 for a drink, $16 for an entrée, soon you are out $50 per person before tip.  I was also disappointed in the cleanliness of the theater, some pages of my menu were stuck together.  No big deal, I'll just exchange it with the seat next to me.  That menu was completely stuck together so I had to use The Boy's menu which was still sticky, but at least not stuck together.   It's fun for a splurge but not an everyday kind of option.  Don't forget to validate your parking!"}
{"text":"The ticket prices were very high for a weekday ($24 for two at noon).   Service in the theater was almost non-existent - it took at least 30 minutes into the movie to get server despite pressing the request for service button.   The most insane part of the experience was the fact they offer only one size popcorn- enough to feed an army!!!  What a waste.  I wouldn't waste the money coming here"}
{"text":"I've come to this theater about two or three times since moving here. The seats are terrible and not comfortable at all. No recliners unless you're lucky enough to get tickets to that auditorium. I could care less for the dine-in experience. It's caused the food, drink, and ticket prices to be higher. Plus you have to add tip on top of that. There also needs to be a way the servers can tell who turned their light on in proper order... the other night we waited forever for a server to come to us, and it was blindly obvious that people who came after us were getting served before us because they were closer to where the server was... and the table light is blinding when you're watching a movie. There's no way to turn it off besides covering it with the menu on the table. Will never recommend this theater and will not return."}
{"text":"I've been three times to experience dine in movies. Seats are super comfy, service is prompt and everyone seems super excited to work here. It's charming to have a bar out front to enjoy a drink prior to the show. Stock up on a huge glass of free water while you're there. Bottles are for sale in the movie theater but why pay for some H2O? :) Bring your parking stub for 4 hour validation.  SEATING There are some pretty neat seats available. With a last minute decision my brother and I sat row 1 for a 3D movie. (Groot was awesome from Guardians of the Galaxy. I'd probably date him.) Turns out the seats up close *recline*.    For another flick we sat further back. (Boo, those seats did not recline. Not sure if seating varies per theatre.) No complaints as sitting in a recliner with A/C blasting away makes for a perfect August day.  Here's where the envy crept in: Behind the front row section is a mini-bar area. You can buy seats that spin! (Seriously, I know how I old I am. Shet it.) I thought it was cool to have a personal table/bar area.  Some of the seats could use WD40. Have no fear, you'll be so entranced by the seats a squeak or two is ok.   DRINKS & FOOD Sweet Geezus, the portions are HUGE. I fork tasted the Tenderloin Tips and eyeballed Rick N's sandwich. Both could readily be shared and both parties satiated. What did I eat? Dessert. Yes, I had a chocolate martini. (Thanks Carlos V. for treating! And driving our sorry butts around.)  The drink menu is impressive. However, I like things simple. It was easy peasy to order a dirty vodka martini w/o any fluffy stuff.  CON Come early. The escalators have been offline the three times I've been there. Elevators exist, however, they are on the small side and fit four people. In case anyone forgot, it's HOT in PHOENIX in AUGUST. [Head shake]  Note: Voicemails left with questions about theatre seating may not be returned. Bummer!"}
{"text":"I like: ~the location (close to me) ~you can grab a drink after a movie or grab dinner before all in the same area ~the theater is traditionally cleaner than most  I hate: ~the smell of gas leaking when you walk out of the parking garage after you park ~getting stuck in the garage after the movie-- i don't get what the hold up is people???  Have your VALIDATED TICKET in your hot little hand as you approach the exit.  Often times, you can be stuck in the garage for 15 mins.  totally blows.  So I gave 3 stars, even though I like the theater itself, it's the parking that deserves zero stars-- so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Last weekend, I went here to see 12 Years A Slave. Figured I might as well be comfortable in a reclining chair while watching a movie that was going to make me feel quite the opposite.  PROS: -This movie theater is really nice, which isn't surprising considering the area. -Assigned seating. No having to get to a movie theater ultra early and risk breaking your neck in the front trying to see the screen.  -Comfy chairs that recline. It's like being in your own living room! -It's totally okay to drink here, there's a full bar! -Because there's a full bar, it's 21 and over! No screaming children..unless you're just a screaming adult. In that case, stay at home and watch a movie.   CONS: -Because it is really nice, tickets are a little pricey. -The upper levels, where I sat, have a railing that is too high. It renders the reclining chair pointless because I had to sit straight up and still struggled to see the entire screen. I mean.. I know I'm like 5'4\" but c'mon!  -Although there's a full bar, it's expensive and makes sneaking booze in more appealing here than a normal movie theater where you can't drink. -A bowl of popcorn (yes..a bowl, not a bag) is about $8 and only comes in one size.   Overall, it was an enjoyable experience despite the cons. It definitely would not be my go-to movie theater, only if it was a movie I was really excited to see.   I can imagine this would be a great first date place, especially if you're the type of person who worries about having nothing to talk about during dinner. No talking required if you're eating dinner in a quiet movie theater! And talk about efficient-if the date's bad it'll be over by the closing credits."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this. The service was good. But I'm so... SO sick. Maybe I'm the fool for trusting movie theater food with SHRIMP served to me in the dark. I won't be back. Just not worth this..."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit this done in theater for quite some time. Today we made our way from Goodyear to Phoenix to check it out. First off when you arrive if you park in the garage just go ahead and take the elevator up because the theater is on top. We made the mistake of going down to the ground level then we had to walk up the escalator stairs since none to the stairs going up were working.  The lady working at the ticket booth was awesome and she helped us figure out what movie to see after the one we were originally going to see was sold out.  She also explained how the whole thing worked. So far so good.  We were early so we sat at the bar and had a drink and appetizer. I ordered a margarita. It was super sour. I had to have them add watermelon purée to it and still couldn't drink it. Later I heard a waiter talk someone out of ordering one. We did a sampler appetizer that was pretty good.  Once we finished that it was time to head into the theater. We found our seats and they were worn out! I had to switch with my husband because the one I sat in originally was so worn out I felt like I was laying down. We ordered a pitcher of beer and popcorn. It took forever to get the beer and even longer to get the popcorn. It was $35 for those two items. I thought it was going to be around $27 but didn't check my receipt to see what they charged. I did hear someone else complaining about being over charged on our way out. When I mentioned it to my son he told me that he did not get all his change after he paid.  I was seriously disappointed with this theater. The seats were not nearly as comfy and the living room theaters and I felt like we got ripped off with the whole dine in thing.  The best part of this experience was sharing a pitcher with my hubby. I doubt we will be back after today's experience."}
{"text":"This is our theater of choice. It's clean, short lines for everything from tickets to refreshments. You can always find a seat. And  those seats are comfortable.  Covered parking. They validate and there is food nearby that is tasty.  They also have $5 dollar movies until 12 PM. So basically matinees are cheap. I enjoy that."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my and my husband's favorite movie theaters and we have been here a number of times  but after tonight's experience we will not be back. When we walked into the theater we were greeted by a friendly server and she offered to show us our seats. I thought we were off to a good start and a pleasant movie going evening. I thought wrong!!! When we looked at the seats we were about to sit in, they looked like some ferocious cat had scratched them all up! The white inside of the chair was showing and the leather was shredded. We flagged down the server and asked for a different seat. She promptly told us to check with customer service and left.  Upon sitting in our new seats we went to take a look at the menu and the menus were sticky and greasy and the food tables were sticky and had crumbs all over them. So disgusting! Even after all of this we still wanted to see the movie. When I opened the menu I immediately had sticker shock! The prices had increased significantly and many of my favorite food items from before were gone. Most of the meals were $16 with the appetizers being $8. This was not including a beverage. We were looking at $20 per person for food and a non alcoholic beverage!! We were finally ready to order and no one came to assist us. We saw servers buzzing all over the theater and not one stopped to help us. We turned on the conveniently located service button  not once but 3 times still no service. We finally stopped one of the servers and told him we were ready to order. He said we were not his section and he would find our server. At this point we had waited 15 mins and were ready to leave. Our server finally appeared. She gave us some story about new management and chaos. We placed our order and settled in to watch the movie.  At this point the previews and movie began and I thought things would start looking up. No such luck! We got no drinks or food for another 20 mins as we watched all of the people around us that ordered after we did get their food. When the food finally came I took one bite and it was cold! I kid you not!! This was the final straw. We picked up our food walk into the hallway and asked to speak to a manger. We told her the situation and our she offered us the option to order something different, no apologies just more cold food. We just informed her we were leaving and would like a refund of our tickets. She sent us to customer service and no apologies there either. We got the refund and left. This was the absolute worse experience we have had at this theater. Never again!"}
{"text":"I'm still exploring my new neighborhood and thought I'd check out my local theater. I looked up movie times online beforehand, but had no idea what I was getting in to.  When I bought my Saturday afternoon ticket, I was a bit thrown back by the $16.50 ticket price. Unless that comes with a full body massage during the movie, seems a bit steep. The young man at the counter explained how everything worked and asked me to pick out my seat from his screen. He printed out my ticket and I was on my way.  I had no idea what to expect from this point.  As soon as you get your ticket, you can head right over to the bar in the lobby and get yourself a nice frosty adult beverage. I was already short on time so I didn't get a chance to visit the bartenders.  I walked to the theater, turned the corner and was stunned by the rows and rows of huge recliners! I had no idea! I found my seat amongst a spicy group of older single gals and told them it was my first time here and I didn't know what to do. They pointed to the cocktail menu.  That's right my friends. You can order booze. From your recliner. At the movies. AND someone brings it to you.   Nestled under my drink menu -- full bar by the way -- was the food menu. Wait, so now you're telling me I can have someone bring me beer while watching a movie AND I can have a cheeseburger? Wow! I ordered my burger and onion rings, which were spectacular, and told the waitress she'd have to pry me out of that seat to get me out of there afterwards.  It's a bit pricey, but totally worth it. Makes a perfect date night too. Plenty of bars right out on the esplanade to grab a cocktail.  I cannot wait to go back!  **hint hint gentlemen!"}
{"text":"Been here several times but this time was by far the worst service. It took 35 minutes to place my first order, then i waited so long for them to come back that i decided it would be quicker to just go to the counter and place and get my order. Then add to it the fact that they changed thier menu and got rid of some of the faves."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome.  I first discovered it with my fat Friend Jeff.    The ultra premium seats in the top shelf section have room o' plenty for kicking back and handy snacks (blanket recommended).   A great practice is going to a morning screening when the tickets are actually affordable--they drop down to $7 bucks or so before 11am. Not a bad day to start the day especially if you're hungover.  You just push the button on your seat and an Oompa Loompa servant pops out of nowhere to take your food/drink order.  Alcoholic beverages available and encouraged.   Food is on par with red robin and drinks are on par with a TGI Fridays/ Applebee's.    That said, those choices aren't half bad when you're watching a movie in a first class airplane chair whilst receiving aforementioned handy J from your buddy Jeff!  Male-male matinee !"}
{"text":"I don't really see the appeal of this theatre. Yes, you can order food while watching a movie...but the food isn't good, it's over priced, and you have to deal with waiters walking around throughout your movie talking to people and taking orders. Not to mention you have to pay your bill during the last few minutes of the movie...very distracting.  We shared the app trio with fries, jalapeno poppers, and a BLT flatbread....the food all tasted like it could have just as well come out of the freezer, overly salty...nothing special. Additionally, it was awkward to share as I had to reach across the seat to get anything (there's no table between the pair of seats).The seats themselves were fine, but nothing special. My biggest complaint is that the movie ticket price itself is more expensive than other AMC locations....why? To have the ability to order food in the theatre that you also have to pay for? It just seems silly to me. Maybe I'm crazy...but I think it's nice to go to dinner and actually talk to the people you are with before going to the movies and don't think you should have to pay extra to have the option of ordering food.....Anyway, sorry for the rant, if this is something you are interested in doing, I suppose this location is as good as any other, but I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Ugh. This hurts. In theory I wanted to love the idea of this concept. I've been here several times since the \"revamping\" and it continues to suck worse each time. The service is horrendous. It's like trying to reign in convicts into jail. The food sucks, over priced and is oddly enough, getting worse each time. They bring you the check without a \"you need anything?\" It's obnoxious and not worth the money.  Don't be swayed, this venue is declining by the second. Wait for it on redbox."}
{"text":"LOVE this theater, It is reasonably priced and has good food and great service. The seats are comfortable when you get the recliners not the red seats. I did feel the seats were too close to eachother and the first time I went I was a lil distracted by the constant movement. But you get use to it and are able to focus. The lounge/bar area is nice and staff is very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Ok so this is how we should watch movies ALL the time! Once you've experienced this theater going back to a regular AMC or Harkins Theater feels like such a downgrade. lol.   I've only been here twice but I seriously love it! The fact that you get the whole Dinner AND a movie experience is amazing. You can't go wrong with comfortable reclined seats and your food and drinks being brought to you. I brought my boyfriend for the first time and at first he was pretty iffy about it and upset that I paid so much for our tickets. But once we got in and sat down he changed his mind about it immediately and loved it! lol. Plus I love saying I told you so. =P  The staff is always extremely friendly and quick at serving you. I think the food and drinks are a bit over priced but you really pay for the experience of the theater I think. I got the bacon cheeseburger which I thought was a bit dry and needed some type of sauce to it. I'd liked to try the drinks next time I come.   Soo.. if you haven't been here? GO! You might feel differently about going back to Harkins after this experience. =)"}
{"text":"This theatre is in a nice location so my husband and I enjoy coming here for a dine in movie experience. Things were very disappointing when we attended a movie last night. After finding our seats and looking at the menu we were saddened to find that it had completely been changed and all of our favorite items were basically gone. The menu had been reduced to basic \"bar food\" items. Then as the previews start we hear a \"vacuum\" sound in the theatre. We thought it was a temporary noise or maybe they were just cleaning the theatre next to us. Not the case, it was a sound we had to endure the WHOLE MOVIE!!!!! After several of us becoming disgruntled over the loud noise, my husband goes to complain and reports back that the movie attendant said it was the wind and there wasn't anything that could be done about it. Well, that's nice! Love paying to watch a movie that has a loud distracting  background noise! It would have been nice if a manager would have addressed the issue or at least given us a free voucher for the inconvenience when we exited the movie. It seemed that they didn't give a hoot about our experience and that was unsettling. None to say the least, not returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"I only go to this theatre for Cinema Suites--Fork and Screen is sort of a lackluster (but still expensive) time.   That said, I love the recliners and the wine has always been good.   The food, however, is TERRIBLE.  Just tonight, I ordered truffle fries... and they were barely lukewarm.  Also, I was one of about 6 people in the theatre so crowd/wait time could not have been a factor.  Sigh."}
{"text":"The new Esplanade is fantastic!  Food exceeded my (admittedly low) expectations. Everything packed a lot of flavor, and there was more thought and care put into it than I would normally expect from a restaurant that sources its food from a national distributor. For example, the breadstick that came with the Chicken Mac 'n Cheese was a soft pretzel. Cute, no? The Mac 'n Cheese and Chicken Fajita Wrap were on par with the best meals I've had at a TGI Fridays or Applebys. I mean that in the best way possible... This is simple whitebread American dining, but it's done well. Price points for food and alcohol were competitive with those chains as well... Most of the meals clocked in under $10, though soda was almost $4.   Service was scary good. Push a button, BOOM! they're there at your side. Our drinks were refreshed before we could finish them. Super friendly waitress. Their efficiency bordered on supernatural. I mean, it's not like they can just look out over a one-room restaurant to see what's going on with their section of tables. So mad kudos to everyone who works there.   There are two kinds of theaters, and you have to go to the AMC website to know which one your show is playing in. Note that the high-end theaters are 21+. Even the basic level had extraordinarily comfortable seating. Seats are arranged there mostly in groups of four. The enormous comfy chairs are worth the slightly higher ticket price.   If you go during the day, don't pay the extra $1 to order your tickets from AMC's site. Otherwise, it's worth it: The seats are assigned.  My only complaint is that the popcorn only comes in a small bag. Refills are unlimited, and you only need to push a button to get more, but it's difficult to share a bag with a group of friends without calling for more every five minutes."}
{"text":"This is the only place I see movies these days. Who wants to deal with the pain in the butt of getting to the theater early and having to fight for seats when you can reserve your seats ahead of time at this theater? I love all the conveniences this theater provides- 1) easy seating, 2) servers who bring you drinks and food (minus one star because the food is just ok in my opinion) and 3) covered parking. Thanks AMC for making movie-going so much more pleasant!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sunday night movie place. My boyfriend and I only like going to the Cinema Suites theatre. Don't even bother with the Fork and Screen side (it just isn't as good). The flatbread pizza is yummy and the servers are pretty great. I wish the prices were a little better or had a better reward system.   Plus I really wish they had $1 sodas like at Harkins... That is my one downfall.   But Overall great experience I haven't even tried any of the other dine ins... no reason to"}
{"text":"The movie was terrible (Rough Night) which of course is not something the theatre can help but everything else was sub-par as well. The drinks came with no ice because they \"ran out of ice\" at 8pm. We cancelled the soft drinks and had to remind the server that we ordered pop corn. We also ordered food (mac and cheese had to be sent back to be warmed up because it sat for so long til we received it and the southwest salad was some kind of mystery meat that I should not have eaten but I hadn't eaten all day so was famished and ate a third of it. When the bill came the soft drinks were still on the bill so had to ask it to be revised which took a while. Unfortunately both my daughter and I have upset stomachs now. The meal costing $50 along with the price of the ticket made this a very expensive evening. We will not return again and will not recommend this dine-in theatre to anyone. The others we frequent (Scottsdale Quarter and Fashion Square) are much better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite theatre to go to with my husband on Date Night. The food is (almost) always good and if it isn't cooked to your definition of perfect, they will gladly bring it back and either remake it or offer you a substitute. No complaints when you want to change your seats, just bring your tickets to the front and they will switch them for you. We go out of our way to go to this amc location because it's the best."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Clean environment. Decent food and snacks. Shows movies. All you can ask from a theatre."}
{"text":"Great theater,wish the seats fully reclined and that they had food that was a little cheaper but it's not a bad theater, it's very small and intimate."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to see a movie.  Garage parking, nice staff great seats, and mostly empty.  You can have the theatre to yourself sometimes."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a dine-in theater. The seats were comfortable except that they lean a little too far back for me. The food was of mixed quality. The parmesan fries were delicious, the grilled beef sandwich was okay, but the milk shake was just awful. It was very very expensive, quite small, and worst of all extremely watery, with actual chunks of ice cubes still in it. Absolutely no hint of any ice cream.  The staff were pleasant and courteous, over-all a nice afternoon."}
{"text":"This will be the last time I frequent this movie theater!  Bad from beginning to end.  It took 20 minutes for someone to come take our order.  25 minutes later half of our food arrives.  Fries were cold and maybe there were 15 in the entire bowl.  Another 20 minutes goes by and our drinks and popcorn arrive.  I explained to the waitress that the fries were cold and that we barely received any to speak of.  She said she couldn't take it off our bill because we had eaten most of them (because we were starving!)  I said I was just explaining to her they were cold and wasn't even asking for them to be taken off our bill.  The movie stated time to start was 7:15... which we all know means there will be a few trailers to watch.....we sat through over 20 minutes of commercials and then about 20 more minutes of trailers!  The movie did not start until almost 7:50.  (though no fault of the theater the movie was HORRIBLE!)All in all a very frustrating and expensive evening.... we spent over $100 for four of us to have two orders of fries, popcorn, one diet coke and one sparkling water, one appetizer, one cocktail and a southwestern chicken bowl.  I get the strong feeling they are really upselling the food and keep you there longer just to bolster their numbers.    That was the worst movie experience!"}
{"text":"I wish I could  rate this theater with 5 stars. Why I can't: It smells like old moldy carpet in the lobby Um, there is a partition wall in front of every row of seats. I am 5'7 and when u sit in the recliner (21 and over theater), you can't see 1/4 of the bottom of the screen!!! Everyone in my row commented on it out loud and I asked the server if anyone had ever complained: his response was a look that said \"of course\" and he said that MANY people have complained. Even taller men in my row couldn't see the whole screen. The more you reclined, the more you lost view of the bottom screen. That sucked. The sound in the theater was not loud enough. Only once did the rear house speakers activate and that was at the END of the movie. It was way too low, especially when you're eating crunchy food. Please, AMC corporate, please spend the money to update the theater lobby and overall interior. Paint, carpet, decor are still out of the 80's. Come on, it's the Esplanade. Take note of Ipic Scottsdales interior and mirror that as much as possible!!! We all know you have the capital to do it.   The plus side: Not that expensive for 21 and over. Seats are comfy Food was actually better than Ipic theater in Scottsdale. Our food (2 entrees and a dessert for three of us) was $35.  Much more affordable than the over priced menu at Ipic. Parking validation for the garage is a plus Nice staff"}
{"text":"Menu isn't as good as it used to be but always a comfortable fun time. Staff is always very friendly.   The gumbo Mac is fabulous!  The shakes are unnecessarily large and the popcorn always perfectly salty."}
{"text":"It's a good thing the seats are comfortable and the showtimes are good because wow has it become expensive to go to the movies. No wonder people stay home and stream.... haven't been to the movies for a long time and it will be a long time before I spend that kind of money to go again."}
{"text":"The absolute best place to watch a movie in Phoenix! Real food with a gourmet/gastro pub vibe! Everything I've had there had been good, but no matter I may eat, I always save room for dessert! The waffle dessert is the bomb! Don't leave without it! Absolutely the best dessert I've had in a while. The candied bacon will delight you're taste buds!"}
{"text":"As a movie theater itself, nothing to complain about. You have lots of room to move around, very comfortable reclining seats, nice staff at the check-in area. Perfect atmosphere to enjoy a movie, if you don't eat.   The fact that you can also dine in makes it really formidable. You just push the button and a server comes to you for drinks and food.   However don't be fooled by the idea to \"dine in\" for a full meal. The menu is limited and it's pretty much only snacks. Also only one or two items have less than 1000 calories. Even the salads, according to the menu, have 1000 to 1500 calories per portion. Unacceptable. Full of very unhealthy food that would be processed, stored, and converted into adipose fat. Great. I had different sushi rolls both times and they were not even good. Too dry and I didn't even taste the fish. My other complaint goes to the service: it's slow and (probably) poor organized. They got me food before drinks, and the drinks took more than 20 minutes to come. I understand the first time I was here the room was packed and the servers were running around for the confusion. But last night they had no excuse, there were probably 10 people total in room #4. How can you supposed to be totally focused on the movie when suddenly you remember \"Didn't I order a beer?\" A beer takes 2 minutes to be delivered.  No one ever apologized for the waiting time and of course, they still charged me for the full thing. Like If I had proper service and good food.   The other issue is the location. I assume 99% of the customers drive here and the only parking available is the covered gated one next to Esplanade. Way too expensive. Last night I paid $9 for 2 hours and a half. In the end I paid more for the parking than for the movie. Perhaps there's another parking somewhere else...but I refuse to walk more than 500 feet alone at night in Central Phoenix.   So in the end, yes try it out, but don't make it your first choice as a movie theater. There are better cheaper ones more conveniently located in Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to catch the latest flick.  It has lots of food/drink options all around, yet because it's not mall you won't find tons of kids, tween and teens running all over the place all of the time.  Most kids who are there are there to watch a particular movie.  In and out of there.    It's also just a perfect meet spot for folks from different parts of town.  It was almost equal distance for friends from N. Phx, Old town Scottsdale, North Tempe and me in SoMo.  With it's location, you know it has to keep things nice, and it always does.  And as a note, something about the place must work to help keep kids calm.  We took a pack of kids (Ok, 3 boys) here to see the first Harry Potter when it came out.  It was awesome.  Got everyone a Starbucks to sip on while waiting in the long line - even though we'd pre bought our tickets we had to get there early to ensure good seats.  And even after an early morning drive that could have made them whiny and a Venti serving of sugar and caffeine - they all behaved perfectly through the entire thing - as did almost all other kids during the whole Harry process.  Dang impressive."}
{"text":"Yes, the 21+ box seats are comfortable.  Yes, it's cool to be able to push a button and have a drink delivered to your seat.  Sure, eating actual food instead of movie theater food is probably a lot healthier.  However, the seats at the AMC theater down in Tempe are just as comfortable, and although they don't recline like the fancy ones at this theater do, the theater down there also doesn't have a wall that cuts off the very bottom aspect of your movie screen.  The food here is pretty poor in quality, so we don't often take advantage of this option.  The drinks are nothing special, a little too sugar-based for me.  The tickets are much higher in price here than at any normal AMC theaters in the Valley.  If you're going to offer food and drinks at your theater, you're going to be making a lot more money off your customers since they're going to be buying more to eat and drink.  I'm pretty sure that movie theaters make most their money on concessions, and combining a theater and a restaurant/bar is a neat trick to increase your profits.  Therefore, I would suggest that your base prices be cheaper at an AMC dine-in theater, or at least equally priced to any other AMC theater instead of marked up.  If someone doesn't take advantage of the food option at this theater, the price for a ticket here is horrendously overpriced, especially when you can find other AMC theaters that are just as comfortable down south.  That said, this theater always seems to sell out in advance, so I won't argue against the business plan anymore.  Instead, I'll drive a bit out of my way to watch a movie in equal comfort for a third of the price."}
{"text":"Upon arriving to our movie a little late, but we had paid ahead of time there were people in our seats. Staff failed to accommodate us, and just let the people chill in our seats. They offered movie passes, but I don't ever want to go back to a AMC period. So I will be filing a claim with the bank! Don't bother calling corporate they are just as rude, and they use no empathy. This company is horrible, I will be going to studio movie grill for now on."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Their food is pretty good and the seats are super comfortable!! The service is always really great and the staff is very nice. It may seem a little pricey but it is worth it! It's hard to go to a normal theater after going to this one! It's almost like watching a movie at home but your getting waited on! Definitely recommend this theater!!"}
{"text":"OK, not a bad chain of movies and we go there almost exclusively. It's clean and that's a plus.  Well,we have had to talk to the service desk to get them to focus the damn movie twice but who hasn't?  What I don't like is the popcorn. OK, not a real big deal but at the prices they charge you'd expect a little more effort.  So many other movie chains give the customer self-serve options for garnishing your popcorn but all these places offer are \"butter\" flavored oil. Well, it ain't butter flavored. It is disgusting.   And popcorn flavor? United Blood Service serves better popcorn in their recovery area.  Come on AMC, get with the future-present.  I'm sure you could come up with a better supplier and better buttery topping than the motor oil you serve. Plus there's plenty of places that offer self-serve sprinkle-on flavors. You serve salt packets. Woo Hoo. Hell, I was in a Daytona Beach Florida theater that had a better concession stand than you do.   If you force us to buy your food at your inflated prices, at least give us something to delight us. Try anyway."}
{"text":"Super fancy! I like how you can order while watching movie. The only downfall is that it could be very annoying since they keep walking in front and we can't focus on the movie but that's normal for a theatre like this, nothing too serious.  Service was ok, it wasn't fast. The popcorn did come early except the drinks where we waited for about 40 mins! But that's ok. Maybe next time, you guys can give the drinks a little faster. We got the basil strawberry drink thingy & the titosaurus. Titosaurus was ok & the basil strawberry drink was good. We like the fancy red recliner chairs.   This place is good for dates! I do wish the arm rest in between can be pulled up so there is extra spaced, you know :)  Overall, experience was good! The servers were very nice though & made sure everything is good!  Thanks! Coming back here again & hopefully the drinks won't take forever."}
{"text":"So I came here yesterday to see snow white and the huntsmen, everything went good as always, except they are cutting back, for example they no longer sell gourmet popcorn, so no more free sample of the day, no more hot towel to wipe your hands, and no more mint ghiradeli chocolate at the exit. the special touch this theater had is gone. Might as well be a regular theater with nice seats"}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time with a date on Saturday night and had a fairly good experience. It was a bit difficult to find the actual theater and I didn't feel there was adequate signage posted after I parked in the adjacent deck. Also, the elevator in the parking deck was broken so I had to take the stairs in four inch wedges- um no bueno. And I walked around the first level for a bit before I realized the theater was up the escalator because again- lack of good signage.  Minor annoyances aside- it's a pretty nice place. There were plenty of tables in the lobby area so my date and I  sat and had drinks out there until closer to showtime. They have an extensive drink menu with most cocktails costing $9 - $12. I had the hard strawberry lemonade. Very refreshing but not enough alcohol in it for me. I found it to be pretty watery.  In any case, close to showtime we made our way to our screening room. Unfortunately it didn't have reclining seats which was really disappointing! My date said only certain screening rooms there have recliners. Minus a star for that because I just didn't find the seats to be overly comfortable or generous in the legroom department.  As for the menu, if you are in search of a healthy dining out experience, it will not be found here. Lots of burgers and fried foods on this menu. Almost every item on the menu was listed at 1000 or more calories and almost NONE of it is vegetarian friendly. There are approximately TWO salads on the menu and both come with chicken.   Luckily I'm a pescatarian, so I was able to order the fish and chips. However, that was a whopping 2200 calories! It came with two cheesy biscuit things which probably had a ton of calories, so I didn't eat those. Ate half the fish & fries and took the rest home for lunch the next day. I will say it was tasty.  All in all this place was fair, but the unhealthy, non-diverse food menu & lack of reclining seats in every screening room make this a less than desirable option compared to non-dine in theaters such as the new Harkins at Fashion Square."}
{"text":"Seats recline, but the angle for the legs and back are not independent. Also, legs cannot be bent to an angle other than the defaulted angle.  No real butter for popcorn. It's coconut oil with butter flavor. I can tell. It's no good. Harkins butter is the best in town.  Service is good, don't have to leave seat.    You do have to leave to use the toilet though."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and enjoyed each visit so far. Once you enter, there's a bar you can order drinks and wait at if you don't want to go into your designated theatre too early (you can take your order inside). Seating is assigned, you can choose where you want to sit when you purchase a ticket. The food is pretty good, but beware of how much you're spending! The service is alright, I don't have much to say about it. The only thing I would change is the leather seats - they're comfortable, but act like a rocking chair."}
{"text":"Seats & floor was dirty with popcorn & spilt soda, movie was 30 mins late in starting"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite theater, but it has gone down in quality pretty significantly. Our waiter acted as if he could care less, the menu was sticky & dirty, and my food was lukewarm. Price wasn't a factor until quality became one. I'm disappointed..."}
{"text":"Uhmm it's our first time in this theater. It's pretty neat. The great thing about it is they do have amazing foods being served! Well as the name implies, it's  a dine in movie theater. So cool! Though they don't have reclining seats, but it's okay because  seat is pretty comfy, plus the mini table for your food which is nice. Well obviously the main highlight of their theater is their 'dine in' service. So that's about it. It's great! They serve the food on your table. Amazing! Our server was very nice, she did an excellent job!  Their food is surprisingly good actually! It's not the typical movie theater foods..they have real good food!  I got myself a bowl of grilled chicken with quinoa, and it's fantastic! Hubby enjoyed his food too! And I really like the  pizza we got! So fresh and it's like homemade good!  The only thing though, their food is quite expensive! But hey there is no cheap food in a movie theater LOL! That's how they make so much money- with their expensive popcorn, food and drinks!  The place seem clean. And I like that they have couches on their waiting area, which is so not typical for a movie theater! Very nice! So, overall, it was a fun movie time indeed! We will come back."}
{"text":"Why haven't I reviewed this place yet?  I've been to about a dozen different movies since Esplanade became a dine-in theater, and every experience has been great. On my most recent visit, the Hunger Games double feature, I was reminded why this place really is a gem: reserved seating. I'd purchased my ticket a month in advance because I'm just that much of a geek.  Typically, I only order water and popcorn unless someone else is paying then I'll order a cocktail and entree. The cost for food really isn't that much more than a nice dinner out, and being able to combine dinner and a movie certainly is swell."}
{"text":"Ok so they finally got new recliners...that's fantastic However how is it that every time I come here they are always OUT of the item I want in the menu??? Seriously how do you not plan and keep the items on hand for the items you have on your menu?? They were out of the steak and shrimp bowl"}
{"text":"Pretty nice theater but not super fancy. The lady working the ticket sales wasn't very friendly or patient. We couldn't purchase our movie tickets online using our gift cards and tried to call ahead but no one answered the phones. Therefore when we arrived we were stuck with crappy seats.   Food was good but pricey for what you get. You're definitely paying for the convenience. Also, the seats don't fully recline which is a bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"The new Fork and Screen is awesome! Being able to lounge at the full bar out front and then go in and have dinner...well, it doesn't get better than that! Keep it classy, not trashy, NCM...and they did an awesome job making this my newest obsession!"}
{"text":"One of the things that frustrates me when I want a night out is that the movie I want to see is never playing at the right time to eat dinner out too. You either have to eat dinner way too early to finish in time and make the show or eat after the show but by then it is midnight. lol     So how to solve the issue, go to a dine in theater. I am mad I did not think of this idea myself. Haha! I had heard a lot about this concept this year but had not had the chance to go to one yet. I finally indulged this past Saturday. I had not been to this location since they remodeled so did not know what to expect except the things I had heard, which were all wonderful.    The concept is a bit different from a regular movie. You purchase your seats with a certain seat number ahead of time, kind of like a play or concert. You can choose between the Dine In Theater or the Lounge. The lounge is three dollars extra and has reclining seats. They advertise the lounge as having \" A more adult like feel! \"  Ok, don't ask me what that means-hahaha! but My friends say it is great.     When I first walked in I noticed the nice lobby lounge chairs and bar. You can order drinks and food outside like in the old days-;0) that's ok too but the great thing here is that your theater chair is actually like a table at a restaurant. No more long lines at the popcorn counter, wow! (People who are late a lot will love it here! Ya hear that certain friends of mine?-lol- You all can run to your seat, get food delivered, and Wah-La the movie starts. brawhahah- sorry I digress) They give you full service right at your seat and even extend it during the movie. There is a button to call the waitress over when you need something but to be honest I never needed to punch the buttons. The servers were all over us the minute we sat down and the minute we needed anything. Actually, the service here was outstanding which prompted me to write a review! I thought it would be a bit distracting but it really was not.    The food was OK not bad but not OMG I am going to die either. The menu was a lot more innovative then I thought it would be so I would go back to try some other things.I just ordered the bread and pretzel basket with red sauce and spicy cheese dip. It was good but how do you go wrong with that? My friend had a burger that she said was good. The Parm fries were tasty.  The thing I liked best is getting refills given to me at my seat. Yahoooo! The simplest things are the smallest blessings.    OK, have to write the negative. You pay for the convenience. The place is very expensive so bring your wallet. The cheapest movie is 12 bucks and the lounge is 15 and the food is over priced. Wow! Shocking you say. Food overpriced at the movies? I am so surprised! But in this case it is really over priced. Well, like I said before you pay for the convenience, I suppose. Sadly, I won't be able to go here all the time but a nice treat every now and again. I suppose when you factor in gas and travel time between a restaurant and a movie house it might be similar.  Check it out. Definitely worth at least a one time visit to see what you think."}
{"text":"So last year we came to see a movie. We ordered some burgers... Well there was a hair in my burger, which made it pretty impossible to enjoy the movie after that. They did get me an all new burger which was good and had no hairs but I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This AMC theater was outstanding! Went out on a date and we heard they serve wine at your seat so we were all in!   We were able to choose the movie, pick our seats and pay all on our smart phone! So easy. The seats are fantastic! They recline to your like and are so plush and comfortable. They have little table that pivot to the side or in front of your seat.   I ordered white wine and my date ordered red. We also ordered a brownie a la mode and they asked if we were splitting it. When we got it, it was on two plate! Perfect.  Overall great experience and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Drive from Scottsdale to this location to see Southpaw because of the limited availability and got there 10 minutes before the showing only to find out that our 16 and 19 year old children were not allowed into the theater because it is for 21 or older.   My wife and I did not understand and thought at first that either the movie content was too harsh or sexually explicit or possibly the theater serves alcohol and turns into a bar or something.   Only to find out after sometime that this is exclusively for 21 and older as designated for adults by the theater.  Had we know earlier we would not have made the drive there and wasted our time. Like a 16 and 19 year old are going to be a distraction like infants in a Disney animation movie.   Come on what a crock of crap!!  We decided that instead of not being allowed in to see Southpaw that we would see Mission Impossible and asked for student discounts only to be asked by the ticket person to show student ID which the 16 year old did not carry with them because the high school requires them to use a lanyard to display at all times and they only carry around at school. The person taking the tickets was stand pat at needing the student ID which I replied \"give us a break you already screwed us over by not allowing us to see Southpaw and now you want to pull this?\"  Besides the worst customer service I have ever experienced the food for all us was horrible.  The coconut shrimp was tasteless and terrible and the mushroom burger had a strange smell.  The ticket person should be fired or taught some customer service because if you piss off all the customers you will eventually have no customers.   I would give this place a zero stars or negative if I could, but the one star is for the waitress that served us.  Btw the ticket person seated us on the end of the first row to see an action movie when the entire second row was empty.  I never make this statement, but this place sucks and will strongly encourage you not to go here.  I will never be back!!"}
{"text":"This theater was clean and overall good during our experience.  The food wasn't amazing but it was decent!  The chairs and area was nice and comfortable, I wish there was more seat offers cause movies book fast but it was still a Good time!"}
{"text":"Reserving specific seats is nice and the kids serving were polite, but  the rest of the concept and execution doesnt work for me. It's too dark to see menus, trailers are too loud to easily communicate with wait staff (let alone your companion), and  settling tabs during films is inevitably distracting.    I'm told their Cinema Suites format is more spacious than our \"Fork & Screen\" option,  but when the 400 pound patron in front of me descended into his Playskool-strength theatre seat - and into my knees with the force of a medium speed car accident, that less than luxurious 'impression' evoked something more akin to \"Fuck & Scream\" -  I literally blurted \"Fuck\" and screamed at  the bone cracking pain  radiating from both patellas.   When I slid over behind fatso's 100+ pound wife, she's banging into me too, so it's not their fault. The seats are just cheap, with lousy springs and they're hard to settle into comfortably.  I was kicked from behind periodically.  All by adults btw.  It's interesting how many yelpers rip kids and seem to feel 'adults only' or food/bev service somehow conveys a first class experience.  To me it felt more like a bad coach flight; cabin lighting's busted and some douchebag's  reclining into your space."}
