{"text":"Traveled from Montreal to Toronto. I stayed in a place near by and my friend recommended this great place for Chinese food for me. The food are so tasty. All fresh and hot. Great spot for lunch and dinner. The venue is modern and clean. They do delivery as well. Delicious food and Great service !!! Make sure you come and check this place out when you are around. You gonna love it!"}
{"text":"In general I try and avoid poorly reviewing mom and pop type shops as a single review can be so troublesome.

But there were a few problems.

I'm not reviewing this place and equating it to authentic asian food but more like Western interpretations of it (a la Manchu Wok, Panda Express, etc.).  As much as I'm not the biggest fan of it, I think there is a place for General Tsao and yellow goop chicken.  I'll get  a craving for it once in a while.

I got the General Tsao and Beef with veg on noodles, and booth items tasted really really off (like sour).  I don't have evidence the food wasn't \"fresh\" but it didn't taste right at all.

Also there were lots of little fruit flies zipping around me while I was eating and the empty tables around me still had food particles from previous dinners.

The service was fine, and decor is promising, but if they don't clean this up fast I don't think it'll last."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to eat Chinese food since I was close to this store I decided to give it a try. From reading all the reviews, I can understand why this place has low ratings. When I walked in there was no customer in site. It was completely a ghost town. Despite that I still continued to walk in and get what I wanted to eat. There was no food in the servery. So I asked the girl that was at the front what I can order, she showed me a menu that literally just had 5 choices and said this is the menu. After looking at it, I just walked out. I didn't try the food but from the reviews and the service I received I'm glad I didn't."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery here now twice. 

Food is great if you like your Chinese food BLAND and WET. Ugh. Just disgusting. We ordered a variety of dishes, including staples like hot and sour soup (literally tasteless, was like a bowl of snot. Without the salt.) Hakka chicken (tasted like a brown paper bag dipped into a puddle on the road), Manchurian fried rice (I think they cooked it in a wok made from 30 day old salmon), etc

I gave them a second chance by holy hell that was probably the worst delivery order I've ever received anywhere. Disgusting. Bland. Off-putting. AVOID."}
{"text":"Dont know if the last reviewer has eaten Asian food prior to their review but to me this is just Manchu Wok in its own store. Its basically a fast food hakka style food and the food itself isnt any much better from what you would find in a typical mall food court. Unlike other Hakka style restaurants the food is not prepared fresh but is sitting in a warming tray waiting to be scooped up. Sorry but I came here looking for real Asian food not fast food with a fortune cookie."}
