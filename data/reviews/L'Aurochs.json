{"text":"We had dinner here last night.  Service was wonderful.  

Ribeye was full of flavor. Sauces were a great add on.  There was also a nice selection of wines."}
{"text":"Negatives: 
- Waitress doesn't know how to smile.  I also asked her for the menu while waiting for two other people in the party, she said \"no, we will wait until everyone gets here\" and she immediately walked away... WTF?
- I had the salmon tartar... was ok, a  little bland.

Pros: Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food, but was a little over priced... it's like high end downtown Montreal overpriced... weird as it is in a suburb of Montreal.   

Bottom line: I'm not going back, I will do La Reserve or La Carcasse in Candiac or even Rouge Boeuf (better Salmon Tartar) instead as they are much better value, especially when you factor in their promos which L'Aurochs has none."}
{"text":"Great steak, good ambiance

Went last night for a work dinner. Our server was very friendly and professional, although he disappeared for a little while (he did apologize) and he forgot our side sauces. I really enjoyed my filet mignon and the mashed potatoes were so yummy. Wine list has many options and categories (I.e. Staff reco's, under $39, under $49, higher end, etc.) many different nooks and different sized tables for your group to sit at. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Whenever I crave a good steak this is the place I go. The steaks, particularly the Ribeye is to die for , one of the best steaks Ive ever had. Everything you order is going to be good. A little pricey, yes but totally worth it. You make your own plate if you choose a steak and I always go for the Ribeye with mashed potatoes and fresh veggies with a thai calamari starter. Top that off with a great beer and your going to have a good time. 

Not only is the food amazing, but the service is top notch too. The servers, one in particular, unfortunately I didn't get his name, are polite , professional and very nice. 

overall great experience with their authentic dinning room and sportier but yet very classy bar! 

Will and still go there quite often!"}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant that serves up mouthwatering steaks.  The ambiance is impressive and the food that I've had here has always been between good and excellent.  However, there are inconsistencies with service, since it can vary from being very professional and courteous to slightly snobbish and negligent.

The steaks are good, and the tartare is excellent.  Their soups are quite tasty as well.  I'd recommend going with the table d'hote and if you've got the urge to splurge, up the ante and the experience with adding truffle oil and other luxuries to your vegetables (since the veggies on their own are unimpressive).  

Overall, a solid spot to eat steak in style."}
{"text":"If you're looking for mediocre service, overpriced food and pretentious staff (and patrons), this is the place for you.

I enjoy classy restaurants, but not ones that really buy into their own hype when they're not that great. The service was mediocre at best. Out of the four of us, I was the only one the waitress seemed to want to talk to. When asking us if the meals were cooked to our specifications, I looked at my plate answering \"Mine was okay,\" wanting to finish my sentence by asking my friends how theirs was, I looked up at the waitress who was already walking away, without leaving me complete a full sentence.

The plates were completely overpriced for such a small portion. I very much enjoy salmon, but I at least expect to get more than 5 pitiful looking pieces of vegetables with it.

My friend's $34 steak was decent. Not $34 worth. I don't mind paying for a good steak. But this wasn't it. With her meat, she ordered a baked potato. And got a very pitiful spud. We had to ask twice for some sour cream.

At least my friends' steaks were decent. But born and raised in Montreal, we all have had better. Often.

My advice: avoid the whole 10-30 area altogether. I have yet to have a pleasant culinary experience in that location."}
{"text":"Quality of food was average at best. They described this was a fusion steak house with some Asian twists. The steak itself isn't worth the price. Put it simply, steak frite would offer a better offering and steak frite is also sub par but far less expensive."}
{"text":"This is a great date restaurant.  My hubby and I wanted a good steak and romantic ambiance and this place delivered.
I am usually really picky with the fat on my meat, but the marbling on these steaks are perfect. I ate the whole thing without a second glance.
It is a little pricey but well worth it for the best tasting steak I've had off the island!
Make the trip, spend the money."}
{"text":"La bouffe était correcte mais sans plus. Le service était toutefois impeccable. Un peu cher par contre"}
{"text":"Steakhouse and bar, slightly upscale with outdoor seating.  Dress is casual, but the inside restaurant feels quite formal.  Service was very friendly.  I head just one course of salad and a Burger.  It was very well prepared.  Overall though its just a bit pricey for my taste."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday night and surprisingly the restaurant was half full. A good sign. Located on the 2nd floor the decor is top notch. Wood tables, high ceilings, a very rustic feel. We were sat by the host, (not offered to take our coats which is surprising for a 5 star restaurant), given menus by someone else, water from another waiter, bread from another and I think butter brought by the 2nd waiter. After a while I stopped looking at the staff as it was so confusing as to who was to be serving me. No point in trying to make a connection at this point. I requested an English menu however they said it wasn't up to date with new items like the French menu. I find this highly annoying that they can print French versions and not bother with an English translation. Almost to the point that I want to leave, but I stay to try out the 5 star food. Up to this point the service was nothing special. We were suggested a Penfold's Shiraz to accompany steak.   No cocktail menu which is a shame as we probably would have started with that if something seemed different. We inquired as to the aged steaks and they only had 1 left being the ribsteak aged for 90 days. It was $120 for a 22oz. We decided to share it opting for quality over quantity. It came with a baked potato stuffed with cheese and bacon ($9 extra) and cheese covered broccoli. The first sign of good service was when the waiter asked what kind of sauce we'd like on the side. When we said mushroom she said that the pepper sauce is good too and that she would bring both out so we can sample both.  The steak came on the bone and had quite a bit of fat on it. It was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. No need for sauce to mask it's natural flavours. It would be like adding ketchup to foie gras. You could really taste some subtleties that regular steaks don't have. You could almost say you taste the farm (and that's a good thing!) however, is it worth $120$? NO. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, and for the price it should have been.  For desert I was recommended the chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream. It was divine. There was actually lava! Bravo to the pastry chef for not overcooking it. 
The damage at the end for a shared \"luxury\" steak, 2 glasses of wine, stuffed potato and a desert with tip was a little over $200.  Will I be back? Probably not very soon. At that price, for mediocre service I'd try my luck elsewhere."}
{"text":"We wanted to try asomething different in dix30, and we were glad we got to try this place. Situated on a 2nd floor, this restaurant has a pretty nice view of dix30 on the terrasse. It was closed because of the weather but we were not to far from the window and it was pretty nice. The place is beautiful and it was a pretty good vibe, not too loud even with the music. We were there around 6pm. At 8pm, it got really busy.

We ordered the meat plate \"le plateau du boucher\". Its a mixted of different meat like ribs, beef brochette, sausages, poutine with short ribs and onion rings. Everything was excellent except the sausages. Never again! They were stuffed with other ingredients that just turned me off! 

But besides that, they have a great selection of wine and cocktails. I wouldn't recommand it if you want something on the regular to low price range."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before visiting last week and was pleasantly surprised. To start, our waitress was amazing and extremely friendly. She immediately got \"stools\" for our purses to not sit on the floor which was very nice. She was very thorough with answering questions and made great recommendations. Following one of her \"favourites\" we started with the calamari which was as she said, amazing. A big portion which can easily be shared and a great Thai flavour. For my meal I ordered the small filet mignon. It was very good, but not the best I've ever had which is why I gave this review a 4/5 rather than a 5/5. The pepper sauce was great but the meat wasn't \"perfect\" but still good. Other than that the ambiance was great and I enjoyed my meal. Greats service."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday and was disappointed ! The restaurant was full, the décor was nice but the food didn't live up to my expectations. The menu didn't have much option. The portions we're small, nothing special about it. I found everything on the menu was overpriced, even the sides. The waitress could have offered a better service  !! We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Overall very good expierence, great ambiance and the food was really good. There service as well was top notch. 

Really enjoyed the steak, baked potatoe and the calamari. 

Definetly going back"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this outstanding restaurant. Two years ago I ate here with a group of 4 people. We ate upstairs and had a very enjoyable dinner - took our time and drank some great wine while having a lovely 4 course meal.
Tonight I ate here alone. Traveling on business and staying at a nearby hotel. I ate in the bar area which was very fun albeit a little loud - but heck, it was a Thursday night so everyone was out having fun. 
I had the steak with asparagus and gnocchi. Totally fabulous! 
I will definitely eat here every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"*Visited in July 2017, evening meals and drinks*

The Good: nailed artificial branché ambiance, elevator

The bad: not attentive serving staff, uncomfortable patio chairs and unbalanced/uneven tables

The ugly: tasteless meal, small serving pending order, and absence of terrace heating (turned off!). 


Overall, The quality-price ratio and value for money is shameful. Its a place to visite to be 
             seen and brag about (?!). Never going back.

There is real option out there if you want chef cuisine (yes, even steakhouse) and great table service."}
{"text":"2 mars 2013
Lors d'un souper entre amis pour célébrer la quarantaine nouvellement acquise d'un ancien collègue de classe, nous nous dirigeame vers L'Aurochs, un restaurant qui se caractérise pour son menu orienté \"viande\" notamment le boeuf Angus.

Dès le départ du service et la présentation du menu, le choix du Angus n'est pas un choix qui bat tous les autres, au contraire, l'essentiel de la préparation ne réside pas simplement dans le persillage du gras de la viande mais encore plus dans le niveau de cuisson et surtout la manière de l'apprêter.

Entrée : pour tester un grand restaurant vous devez débuter par le tartare de boeuf puisque c'est la combinaison ultime pour démasquer ceux qui ne savent pas l'apprêter correctement. La recette originale française comprend environ plus d'une dizaine+ d'éléments, comme des échalottes finement hachées, des fines herbes, quelques épices orientales, un petit oeuf de caille, etc... Lorsqu'un serveur vous demande si vous désirez le plat plus \"relevé\" et si vous dites oui, vous devez vous attendre à obtenir un plat qui sera plus GOÛTEUX, plus SAVOUREUX, plus ASSAISONNÉ, sans être UNIQUEMENT PLUS FORT donc PIMENTÉ. Le piment est un fruit assaisonné contenant de la capcéicine, ce qui donne la sensation de douleur nerveuse en bouche. Si vous relevez un plat QU'AVEC du piment vous n'avez pas compris la leçon. Malheureusement, le tartare ne fut que plus piquant. Ensuite, si on sert un tartare accompagné de pain, comme il le devrait, on doit le faire avec du pain croûté, blanc, ET SURTOUT NE JAMAIS ACCOMPAGNER avec des tranches de pain SURCUITES et surtout très très friables. Vous risquez de faire s'étouffer vos convives lorsqu'un morceau éclatera dans la bouche. Et oui !, il faut comprendre qu'un pain déséché et cuit comme un crouton n'offre AUCUN lapse de temps pour s'humidifier lorsqu'on y dépose le boeuf tartare. Ainsi, lorsque vous croquez dans la tranche, elle éclate et part en biais dans votre gorge, et peut ainsi causer un grave étouffement, ce qui aurait pu arriver d'ailleurs à votre narrateur ! :-). Il est donc primordial, voire obligatoire, de servir un tartare avec un pain croûté, avec une mie intérieure tendre et bien chaude. Votre plaisir bucal gustatif n'en sera que plus rehaussé puisque c'est l'hydratation et la dissolution de l'amidon dans votre bouche qui contribue à donner ce petit goût sucré et doux durant la consommation du tartare. Si en plus votre recette est bien structurée et correctement rehaussée, les saveurs en bouche seront TOUTES amplifiées. ce qui ne fut pas le cas, malheureusement. Donc un point de plus pour  LES DEUX GAMINS ! .

Plat principal : Pour vraiment tester les dires d'un restaurant qui se bat la geule en parlant de persillage de la viande, il faut tout d'abord voir la viande crue au départ sinon C'EST PEINE PERDUE, vous ne pourrez jamais distinguer une viande persillée d'une autre. Le Angus N'EST PAS le seul à l'offrir. Vous pouvez trouver aussi bien parmi d'autres sortes. Tout est une question d'élevage et de talents de la part de votre boucher. Un restaurant de viandes n'est égalé que par son boucher. Donc choisir un Ribeye steak de 12 onces n'est pas la seule chose à faire même si on demande une cuisson saignant-médium-saignant. Ensuite, c'est la qualité de la pièce en terme de comestibles/non-comestibles. Ce ratio définit ce qui se mange et ce qui ne se mange pas sur une pièce de viande. Si votre ratio dépasse 85-90 % en comestible c'est parce que vous avez vraiment une très bonne coupe de viande qui vaut vraiment son prix. Ce n'était pas le cas pour moi. Le ratio avoisinnait plutôt le 70-75 %. C'est cher payé !

On vous sert ensuite tout un accompagnement d'à-côtés avec votre viande. La petite marmitte de champignons était malheureusment très salée. Il est ici question d'un \"salé\" dépassant la quantité habituelle à absorber, il n'est nulement question d'un état de goût et d'esprit. Le goût devenait vraiment trop important en descendant dans la marmitte ce qui faisait augmenter considérablement la quantité d'eau à ingurgiter. Les champignons ont été clairement préparés avec négligeance et peu à considérer pour l'expérience du client. Deuxième à-côté, une petite marmitte de pomme de terre à l'ail apportait quand même un mieux au plat. La purée était assez grossière mais correctement savoureuse. 3e à-côté, deux beurres choisis dans une liste pour accompagner le steak. Un beurre préparé ne présente aucun défi, ils étaient donc bien ordinaires.

Globalement, les assiettes n'étaient particulièrement pas présentées pour aller avec la facture. On s'attend nettement à mieux de la part d'un tel endroit pour terminer avec 120 $. Que ce soit pour présenter un steak ou une côte levée, les vulgaires mini-marmittes cuisinart auraient pu être remplacées par de merveilleux bols ou servis dans un plat séparé.

Devons-nous y retourner ? LA QUESTION parmi les questions. tout dépend de votre budget !"}
{"text":"Food was fine, but the portions are small and very overpriced for what they are. Wouldn't go back..."}
{"text":"Un peu dispendieux pour le type de restaurant.  Très bon service.  Nous à permis de voir le match du Canadien en série.
