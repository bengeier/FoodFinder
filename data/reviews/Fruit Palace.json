{"text":"More than satisfied anytime I go to fruit palace. After my first visit I've been a regular here. The pupusas are on point, and the sandwiches never let me down. Delicious is an understatement when speaking about the quality of smoothies and juice here, fruit place made fresh by order smoothies and juices are a unique taste explosion in my mouth and always satisfy."}
{"text":"THE PUPUSAS ARE DELICIOUS! 

I had the pork and cheese pupusa, with a Salvadorian style elote and it so good I had to force myself not to order 2 more... The food is great, and the staff is super friendly, I definitely recommend this place. Its not just a fruit and smoothie place, because their food is better than other restaurants in the area and its affordable."}
{"text":"Las Pupusas estan ricas, tienen una gran variedad de comida para todos Los gustos y la atencion al publico Es increible, apoyemos a Los negocios locales y a nuestra cultura"}
{"text":"Noticed this little mom and pop shop the other day and decided to stop in.  So glad I did!  I ordered 2 pupusas (cheese, revuelta) and they are some of the best I've had.  The hot version of their red sauce is amazing and the curtido (the slaw) is great, too.  Will definitely come back for $1 pupusas on Tuesday.  Just a tip, they have a minimum of 12 pupusas for $1 Tuesday special.  I will also have to try some of their other \"platos tipicos\".  Give this place a try if you are in the mood for good food and are in the area...your wallet and your belly will thank you!"}
{"text":"This place should be called FOMO because Mexican-Salvadoran desserts are little known to many Americans especially those from the East Coast. 
Don't be afraid of what you've never tasted. 
If you are brand new to these fruit desserts you must try these:
1. CHAMANGO - chopped mango, mango slush, tamarind slush, and tangy chewy candied tamarind bits topped with a candied tamarind wrapped around a straw.
2. COCO PREPARADO - slices of fresh coconut, candies tamarind, tamarind sauce, cucumber, coated peanuts, jicama. 

And if you've never had pupusa, they are amazing here and are only $1.75 for one and they're huge! Pupusas are like fried stuffed pancake quesadillas."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good! Wonderful food , just their service was ok. Food was on own time , AC was not working so it was extremely hot while waiting for our food. Amazing prices!!"}
{"text":"I went in with my father who speaks Spanish and me not being able to speak Spanish I really didn't have any concern as I knew what I wanted and most the fruits I want I know in Spanish. The blonde lady there either doesn't know what's on her own damn menu or she doesn't understand Spanish, because I said 3 times what I wanted the kind of fruit I didn't want and which fruit I wanted simple Spanish that I can even manage for someone who doesn't speak it. And they messed my order up even after my dad confirmed it with them. Half their menu is in English either speak English or put your entire menu in Spanish because I assume someone in there knows a little bit of English. 

On the other hand the pupusas are amazing, the crepes are mouth watering and the fruit is fresh and juicy."}
{"text":"Very delicious. Friendly staff and defiantly a place we needed on this side of town. Will come back. The fruit was fresh, and the dishes were very authentic. Also the tamale was very good. My favorite was the corn with mayo and cheese. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Came in today to kill time while my car was being washed. There was a guy at the counter. I didn't get his name but he was very friendly. I tried the strawberries and bananas with cream. Omg they tasted like heaven. Soooo yummy!!! The cream they use has cinnamon mixed in and made it taste even better. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"New favorite place!! This spot has such good items for cheap! The menu definitely caught my eye when i first walked in, i was in loveeee. It's a very small casual spot but it's great. Not to mention they had spongebob on when i was there which is definitely a plus. Overall i would say give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Henderson has been tough cause I sure do miss Bay Area treats. Fruit Palace gives me a little taste of home while enjoying the desert heat. Love me a great homemade pupusa and nothing beats a raspado to wash it all down. Say yes to the bacon wrapped hot dog, try the pickled pig skin. If you are hesitant to try the sweet treats, try the savory. 

I loved watching the delivery man taking a smoothie on their way out, working folks picking up orders of warm pupusas for lunch. So excited to have discovered a little bit of authentic Mexican and Salvadoreno eats. 

*clean bathrooms and they accept cards :)"}
{"text":"Best pupusas i have had in Las Vegas/Henderson. I had the panes con pollo, pupusas revuelta, and chamango. Food made to order so there is a small wait. In Tuesday they have a dozen pupusas For $13."}
{"text":"Awesome, they're open on Sunday evenings. The pupusas here are my favorite.  Made fresh to order. So they come out nice and warm to your table.  The elotes are popular here too, so you might have to wait a while for them to make a new batch.  The fruits that they put in my dessert bowl was nice and cold, in season and not pre cut.  So it's pretty fresh. 

They guys who helped me out with ordering were really nice and helpful. I was told to come on Tuesdays for the Pupusas special.  But my meal here was under $16 bucks. Not bad for entrees, dessert and a drink!

The place is clean, the area it's in is off Boulder Hwy, is pretty sketch, but the parking area was well lit."}
{"text":"The fresh made to order pineapple fresca is the only reason you need to come here! They are delicious! So refreshing and so good.... and don't forget about the pupusas! But be careful, the sauce has a spicy kick on it, that can be taken care of with the help of the pineapple fresca!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing !!! they have tuesday special 1 dollar pupusas, the smoothies are so good , the fruit is fresh , the service is amazing , i work in a hospital close by , they always deliver for us ,just great overall !!"}
{"text":"They make the best Pupusas I've ever had!! First time eating here. I'll be a regular. Everything looks amazing. I had Pupusas, fried bananas, and re fried beans. Yum yum. I'll be back to try their crepes and smoothies.  The price is right. Nothing fancy just right."}
{"text":"WOW! I tried the corn on the cob YUM!!! the tamales AWESOME!!!! and the pupusa?? well I have never heard of it before but will be back!! I suggest you try this place once the food and prices cant be beat"}
{"text":"So far i have tried a few things on here and I can already tell im gonna he here very often! Inexpensive and delicious! Pretty traditional hispanic place! The fresh juices are tasty and natural. I also tried the nutella crepe and they give a great amount of fruit for a low price. Great place for a snack or for food! Love!"}
{"text":"I tried a good majority of the savory dishes here and I don't know if it's because I'm not used to the flavors (although they weren't that new) or because it wasn't done that well but I just though it was alright.  
I had the:
pastelitos salvaorenos de pollo (probably my favorite of what I got.   Similar to empanadas)
pupusa revueltas (good but just tasted like cheese)
pupusa chicharron (tasted the exact same as the revueltas)
pollo tamal (good but too much masa compared to pollo)
puerco tamal (the Puerco was a bit dry and again, too much masa)

It all tasted kind of similar to me to be honest, nothing distinctive.  I will say though that the salad that is served on the side is amazing and I would put that on so many other types of food!  I did not try any desserts and those look amazing so I may have to go back simply for those.  Although I thought it was just alright, my friend who has had them before and is Latina absolutely loved it and said it reminded her of her family's cooking so it must be authentic."}
{"text":"I love it here! The chile rellanos are amazing. I love the papusas the nutella crepes and Tamales."}
{"text":"Few days ago we bought  chicken tamales.  They are so good and tasty.  But the problem is we payed $5.25 for 3 and I wasn't happy cause they were to small.  Literally really small.  They were $1.50 and it was a perfect size.  Not to happy at all.  Don't mind paying $1.75 but for the right size."}
{"text":"This place is cheap and awesome! I've had the pupusas's, smoothies, watermelon juice, tamales, crepes, elote, yuca grits y sancochada and chamango. Everything was delicious! A great place to grab a quick snack. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Cute small place to go have breakfast lunch or dinner! Loved it! Staff is very polite and friendly and they make everything just taste good"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this \"whole on the wall\" place located in a not too perfect location, but everything we tried was worth it. We had a tamarindo raspado, and it was real tamarindo, we also had the pepinos, and coconut, and tostilocos. Everything was perfect! When we get back in town we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try! Definitely going to be a regular here. We had $1 Pupusas, Elote, and Nutella Crepe. Outstanding food! Really fun, cute and clean atmosphere. Definitely want to come back and try some other things. I love that they have smoothies and juices."}
{"text":"if you're looking for salvadoran/mexican food and snacks, this is THE place to go! they have a menu on the wall behind the register and also one on the table at the register as well. i call this place like a snack place because they have food that is what you would call \"snacks.\" for instance, my friend got the coco preparado (slices of fresh coconuts, tamarind sauce, jicama, chopped cucumbers and candied tamarind) and it is the size of a take-out box but it's not like a hearty meal, if that makes sense? it's enough to fill you up, but it's not the typical \"meal\" that we think of. 

this place is nice and clean, with friendly customer service. i got the papusas and they were filled with gooey cheese exploding from them! pupusas remind me of a pancake stuffed with cheese and you eat it with pickled cabbage, jalapenos and carrots. DELICIOUS! plus side of this is that it is inexpensive too and on tuesdays, if you get a dozen of pupusas, they're $1.00 each!! all in all, i am coming back here next time i'm around the area!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get the fruit salad where you pick four fruits. Always fresh and delicious - inexpensive and great service too."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mexican street corn and while we were driving home we kept smelling something really bad. When we opened the food we found out it was the corn. I took a bite but it was not good! My friend ordered a crepe that was terrible as well. Safe to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow what a nice surprise. Fresh food and friendly service. Really liked the panini de tuna. It had pesto on it and I would have never thought how good it was. What a treat and everything was so fresh including my smoothie. Very good and good price too. Will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! I lived in San Salvador for a couple years and this restaurant brought back some good memories. Amazing pupusas and agua frescas."}
{"text":"This place defines why I LOVE Yelp. I was bored with underwhelming and overpriced hotel food during a 3 days conference, and wanted something delicious for brunch that locals enjoy. I ordered caramel crepa with banana and strawberry. It was absolutely delicious! I loved the faint hint of cinnamon in the filling. I wasn't sure about the instant coffee, but it was robust and flavourful. Next time I'm in this neck of the woods, I'm coming back. Gracias!!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Fresh made Pupusas are $1 on Tuesdays, drinks are deliciously made with REAL FRUIT, their chamoy is made in-house, staff is friendly and professional, clean place, and food prepared/served EXACTLY what you see on the pictures on the menu!! Nom-nom... good eats!!"}
{"text":"Stop by for some pupusa and I was glad since I also got the Salvadoran pork tamales.  This place is super clean and bright, and the staff speaks English.  They have so many option but I opted for what I wanted to come here for.  The chamango look so good but I will have to return for it."}
{"text":"Hard to read menu, seems  very scattered.  Odd fruit concoctions on the menu.  Have to say though, amazing pupusas... we had the squash and cheese and the mixed and they were perfect, not to greasy, delicious.  The Curtido served along side of them had the welcome additions of jalapeños, since the red sauce served with Pupusas is notoriously bland.  The elote Mexican style was not as good as the ones served in carts in Hispanic neighborhoods on L.A. Although they do offer two versions ; one with \" black sauce\". The veggie panini was a charred whole wheat piece of toast with a hint of pesto, a sorry piece of lettuce and tomato, with avocado and a brick of cheese.  Also the horchata is disgusting, absolutely disgusting.  It tastes like whole milk with a faint hint of cinnamon.  It made me sick to my stomach.  I might go back for the pan con pollo, but that's a biiiiiiig but"}
{"text":"We stopped by because we've seen it many times and we finally decided to try it out! The staff was friendly the kitchen was very clean. We got popusas and they were so delicious! Really filling and well priced. We got the Nutella crepe, it was huge but so good we finished it all. The smoothies are great too. We just found our new spot!  The menu is very diverse and inexpensive."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to get fruit bowls with a Salvadorian spin, plus on Tuesdays they have a pupas special that's a great price and freshly made! Definitely call ahead or order and have a smoothing while waiting. It's the perfect place for a great snack that ranges from smoothies, fruit, crepes, pupas, and other Salvadorian dishes. The employees there are also great at giving wonderful service making you feel welcomed to come again"}
{"text":"Fresh food (not the syrupy / artificial stuff), real ingredients, & the best part... it's affordable! If you haven't tried this place yet, you're missing out on some deliciousness! I love their passionista drink and their chicken panini (which comes with complementary freshly cut fruit on the side). I recommend ordering pickup to avoid waiting if you're on the go. The location is to the left of Burger King when you pull into the shopping center. Make the healthy choice and try out this place! It's a small restaurant and I want it to continue to stay in business!"}
{"text":"Just came back from here. I ordered three papusas and three tamales as a meal for two. I read someone's review that stated the tamales were small. They were not. We were beyond stuffed and very much satisfied with the quality and quantity of the food. The ladies who work there are really nice and helpful. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome. I can't believe I finally found authentic delicious Pupusas! If you grew up in an Italian household you know how difficult it is to eat a red sauce that isn't your mom's. Same goes for me and pupusas. The only place we have had in Henderson for Salvadorean food is Las Pupusas and although my Mexican husband likes them I couldn't deal with how greasy and more like bad pizza they resembled. I digress, point is this place is great I'm so happy i found it. We've ordered pick up twice, two days in a row. I can't wait to actually go sit and eat there and have a tasty fruit treat to follow."}
{"text":"I decided to take my wife someplace different for lunch and decided on Fruit Palace.

It's a very small family owned place. The staff is very friendly. 

I haven't had a papusa in a long time so we both had them for lunch. I had the pork and she had the squash and cheese.  Both were some of the best we've ever had. They are served with something like a slaw with sauces. The mild sauce was great and the hot sauce will burn you in a good way.

It looks like they make all kinds of fruit smoothies and juices but we didn't have any on this visit. I will definitely try some the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Best fruit smoothies ever!!! They have about 5 different smoothies to pick from and me and my friend chose two different ones. The average price is about $5.50 for a smoothie. Once we ordered them we saw the employees choosing the fruits and making the drinks. Everything is fresh and made to order. 

I really enjoyed my smoothie and it would even work as a meal replacement. I can see coming here once in a while to order one of the smoothies for breakfast...or just to drink one! 

The service was also fast and friendly. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place I heard so much about first I only give 3 start only because today when I walk in the door the  foul smell I don't know what it is but I'm sure it's not the fruits smell but just can't wait to get out of there and also the lady that taking my order she's kinda snappy I think she's just ready to go home or something.anyway that being said I order the pepino locos or something idk the name but it's some cucumber with some good stuff in it I had to go home and eat it there cause can't stand the smell inside of the place but it is so goood so yummy love the combinations of everything they put in it oh and I also got the fruit palace smoothie that is good also so that being said I'm still gonna come back and try some other staff they have..but hopefully they can get that awful  smell out of there"}
{"text":"My coworker and I wanted something light for lunch and found this place was nearby. The gps directions were a little off because it showed it was next to the car wash. You actually have to drive into the parking lot of the mini mall area and it's across/behind the Burger King. 

We went in on a Friday and, right as we walked in, saw their sign for 2 for 1 raspados on Fridays. Totally had to take advantage of the offer so we ordered 2 mango raspados, mine with lechera (condensed milk) and my coworker's with tamarindo. The raspado was so refreshing and the lechera added a nice creaminess to it. We also ordered the bionicos (fruit salad with cream and granola) and the staff allowed us to choose the fruit we wanted in it. They cut the fruit right in front of us so we knew it was fresh. The serving was huge, too! The cream was the perfect addition to the fruit and the granola added a nice crunch. 

The staff was helpful and gave us recommendations on what flavors went well together. They also informed us of other specials through the week. Just be mindful, they cut and prep everything to order so it may take a few extra minutes. Lots of other items on the menu so a trip back is in order."}
{"text":"Only went here once but seemed pretty good. Interior can use some work. The smoothies are really good here!"}
{"text":"This place has authentic Mexican food as well. Totally delicious. I got a Chamango and it was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"I've gotten tamales and the chamango ..  Chicken tamale is bland, the elote (corn) tasted like it was just masa, no flavor. I've come back for a second chamango. Idk if I'll order anything else, I want to try the other fruit concoctions .. Eventually!"}
{"text":"Good Pupusas and smoothies! This place takes awhile to make your order so I recommend ordering anything extra incase you're hungry later.

I give it 3 stars because the lady who answers the phone doesn't speak English and hangs up when you speak English."}
{"text":"OH MY MY MY. The smell of dessert just lingers all around you.

Where have you been my whole life, fruit palace!? They really are a palace of fruit. All of their signatures have fruit in or served with the meal. They've got chamangos (which are a must try) and elotes, they also have fruit platters, and crepes. Lots of different drink options for sure. I really am a big fan of crepes and trust me when I say, they have mastered the crepe here (it's soft and delicious). It's ONLY $5.99! What a STEAL! Comes with your choice of two different fruit toppings, and they have nutella or cinnamon. But seriously, this is an excellent place to go to for dessert. I just wish I knew about them before. It's definitely a small mom and pop shop that's a hidden gem but that's what I love most about it.

It will really make your mouth water!"}
