{"text":"Amazingly good Chilean food - delicious freshly made empanadas (my two favourites being beef & jalapeno and chorizo) as well as a great selection of sandwiches served on the freshest of fresh bread. I love the steak or chicken ones."}
{"text":"When my dining companion suggested taking a bit of a trip to Plaza Latina, I was more than happy to say yes. I'm always up for trying something new.

We arrived at the somewhat rundown mall around noon on a weekday and the food court was pretty much a ghost town. Many of the eateries weren't even open, but Autentica was and seemed promising.

Looks can be deceiving.

We shared a few different things:

Completo (\"Homemade bread, wiener, fresh tomato, avocado and mayonnaise\"): So this was just a hot dog, basically. It's prepared and served in such a way that one's efforts to get a bit of everything in each bite prove completely fruitless, so you get a bite of wiener and then a separate bite of toppings. This is the least of the concoction's problems. It's just completely bland and tasteless, is the real issue here. The plentiful avocado is nice, but there's absolutely no zip or zing to the dish. The oddly crusty bread is a poor fit, as well.

Lomito (\"Homemade bread, tender pork loin, fresh tomato, avocado and mayonnaise\"): Given the assortment of toppings, it shouldn't come as a surprise to learn that this was just as ineffective as the Completo. Tasteless to an almost offensive extent, the Lomito is the food equivalent of a thoroughly mediocre movie: it's relatively painless but you forget about it within seconds.

I should note also that both sandwiches claim to come with mayonnaise but actually contain Miracle Whip. Not the same thing at all, guys.

We also shared a Chorizo Empanada, which, surprise, surprise, was also underwhelming. The filling was devoid of spice and not nearly as flavorful as one expects from anything containing chorizo. Bland, bland, bland."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding, and it is seriously addictive.  The owner puts her heart and soul into her food.  For your Central or South American fix, this is THE place to go to.  A bit out of the way, but worth the travel time.  She has an incredibly fresh and good selection of different empanadas which are home made, luscious churros and different Chilean sweet cakes.  Steak sandwiches also available, different ranchero type options.  Spotlessly clean, friendly and polite behind the counter service.  I love Mercado Latino for so many different stores there - but this place is the first I run into when I am there.  There is a food court opposite her bakery which have some amazing Salvadorean, Ecuadorean and Mexican restaurants."}
