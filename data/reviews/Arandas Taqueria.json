{"text":"Best Sopes ever!!! The carnitas were amazing. Carne asada was awesome too. Beans were fresh and the salsas were well balanced and very tasty. If you are tired of gringo-ed versions of Mexican classics you need to come for a visit. It's all about the flavor here. The Dining Room is clean but without a real sense of style. I am impressed every time I come here, you will be too. If this place was in Summerlin you would pay triple for authentic food like this."}
{"text":"On our way to Nellis AFB to pick up our sons, my husband and I stopped here for lunch, since we missed our turn for El Pollo Loco. Being a couple of white folks who've visited Mexico plenty of times, we decided to be adventurous. So glad we did, the food here is amazing! Had the shrimp taco platter and it was delicious. This place is super authentic Mexican, right down to the styrofoam cup of hand soap in the bathroom (the dispenser was broken.) I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"They have some of the best burritos I have ever tasted.  It is loaded with a lot of meat and will fill you up quickly as they are pretty big.  The flavor is good, the price is good, the service is good; I would highly recommend to anyone that is on this side of town."}
{"text":"Great food! Best shrimp burrito I've ever had. Get the nachos, you won't be disappointed! 10x better than Roberto's!"}
{"text":"LOVE the champurrado!!! They have a guy that sells churros outside starting at 5pm or so, depending on the season . They fry them fresh on the spot and I swear they are the best churros I've found outside of MX... Just be careful because the really are addicting and you will eat them all!!"}
{"text":"Will never go here again the cashier was rude and food is disgusting!! Wanted enchiladas and what I got was gross. My horchata was bad also and very dirty place."}
{"text":"My 1st time here. We got breakfast burritos & they were excellent. The place has a good vibe with bookshelves, artwork,  etc."}
{"text":"It's a dive, but the food is world class. There is nothing comparable in the area, though there are many restaurants that serve similar cuisine."}
{"text":"I must say these are some of the best tacos ive had by far! I absolutely love it!  Im originally from Mexico and ive gone to many places and nothing comes close! This place definitely is authentic! Must say im happy to have found this place and at night they make churros they are bomb as well! Def recommend this place to people who want authentic mexican food!"}
{"text":"Very different from CA Mexican food but the best I've had in Vegas...lost a star for the bathroom...food stellar...Mexican soap operas priceless..."}
{"text":"If I could give them negative stars I would. Years ago they where one of the best Mexican food spots to go to but now they really suck. I ordered al pastor burrito and it didn't even taste like it. It was so dry that I thought I was eating a carnitas burrito. NEVER again will I be going here again. Mind you I am Hispanic and for me to say that this place is not worth going. I would rather drive 30 minutes away for good Mexican food than eat them and they are like  5 minutes away from me. Definitely will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. I drove about 45 minutes to get here because I was referred by a friend. It was WELL worth the drive. It was clean, fast and the employes were super nice. I got a enchilada place with rice and beans. It was delicious! It was so great that I even ordered more food to go! I highly recommend this place for anyone craving authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The food here is  great.  Has good flavor and reminds me of my grandmas cooking.  Customer service was also good, the lady at the counter was friendly and patient while we looked at the menu and decided what we wanted.  I ordered the gordita and taco combo and everything tasted great.  My husband ordered the enchilada and taco combo.  He said this was very good.  I also ordered a champurrado and I must say that it was the best I had ever had.  The taco was good, but I have had better.  If I'm looking to only have tacos, I already have another place for that.  Since the food was so good here I know I will be returning to try other dishes.  The only thing I did not like was the way the food was served on styrofoam containers cut in half.  It just looked a little ghetto to me, and that's why they got 4 stars from me.  Also, for all the food we got and drinks, our total was $16! You can't beat that, every time I go out to dinner with my husband our total tends to be around $22.00"}
{"text":"We go to church nearby here and my husband is a big fan of hole in the wall eateries.    We walked in and saw only Mexicans and the place was filled - for those of you how don't know how to spot out authenticity - with only Mexicans and that is a VERY GOOD SIGN!  We ordered Carna Asada, Chili Verde, Horchata and a few other things.  This food is the best Mexican place we have eaten at in all of Las Vegas!  Wow such an awesome place, you absolutely have to check this one out and it's worth the far drive from the strip if you're just here visiting.    Atmosphere is okay Service is okay The Food you ask? AAAMMMMAAAZZZIINNGGG!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better Taqueria's in Las Vegas. The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, and I come here at least once a week. And I highly recommend it to anyone looking For that authentic Mexican taste"}
{"text":"Bad bad service ! The lady in the front is rude and nasty she doesn't wash her hands!  She left me waiting on drive thru for an hour at 103 degrees outside! She was awful! I don't think I will ever come back here again!  I love me some good food but I also love me a good service with it!  The food is ok but they won't work with you if you want to change your order up a little!"}
{"text":"Authentic hole in the wall! I ordered a fish taco and the veggie burrito. Very inexpensive. I didn't give this place 5 stars because my fish taco was so greasy. All I could taste and see was oil. However, the burrito was on point. Very filling portions. I recommend it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"In Vegas for meetings all week and I am always looking for a cool \"local\" joint that is cheap with great food. Arandas Taqueria is just that. Got the Carne Asada Taco combo with Horchata for lunch. The food is very authentic and the prices are very good. Three tacos, rice, beans, homemade tortillas chips and a large Horchata was only $8.38 out the door. The food was fresh and the service was fantastic. Stop by and judge for yourself. This place was a great find. Hope to stop back by before I leave town."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall restaurant! I don't ever crave for Mexican food but this place was amazing! Better than the popular El Gordo in my opinion. I love their tacos! I am a huge fan of tripe (if you don't like intestine stay away but if you do you must try!) it was sooooo amazing, crispy, juicy and flavorful. Also tried their beef burrito, they use the tomato rice inside!!!! My favorite type of rice... So freaking good. I would defiantly come back again and again and again. And take my family here to try!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered the hard tacos and received hard rolled taquitos. And when I told her that I asked for tacos she said those were tacos . And I asked for beef shredded tacos and got machaca. Machaca is a mixture of animal meat. I will never return. I had not at all day because I wanted some hard Mexican tacos and I had the worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Wonderful salsa bar and authentic Guadalajara food.. so happy we stopped here. You must try a birria taco with the pineapple salsa"}
{"text":"Good authentic good and friendly staff. And they have a library of books in Spanish. Excellent."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, cheap tacos, tons of options! Carnitas were amazing! Would recommend for anyone who wants a quick bite of authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is authentic, very well priced, and damn good!  When I worked for the power comany we used to hit this spot up when we were on the east side of town. Good steak & shrimp burittos, street style tacos.  I sometimes take my out-of-town white friends here to let them see a side of Vegas most tourists wouldn't see being so far away from the strip. :)"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food! We have been looking for good, authentic, reasonable Mexican food since we moved here 2 years ago. We both tried the al pastor, chicken, carnitas, machaca and carne asada tacos just to get a taste of a few things. Everything was excellent except the chicken. Very dried out. I had the agua fresca watermelon which was perfect. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is because we really like a margarita with our Mexican. Even though we live in Boulder City, we will drive all the way back here again."}
