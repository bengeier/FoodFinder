{"text":"This is a really great place to eat and it supports an amazing cause. My friend and I were doing a project on Belmont.  Several people told us that this was an awesome place to eat, so we came here for lunch.   Taken from their website, \"Cherubs Cafe & Candy Bouquet provides vocational training and meaningful supported employment options for individuals with mental retardation.\" It is a ministry of Holy Angels and is staffed with many of the individuals that Holy Angels helps. It's located in downtown Belmont on Main Street. It wasn't very busy and definitely not noisy. I ordered the Three Cheese Grill with a side of Pasta Salad and it was delicious. My friends ordered the Turkey & Swiss Panini and hers was also great. It was served warm and drinks were constantly refilled. Though we didn't order them, they had ice cream and coffee drinks available. All profits go to help fund Holy Angels programs and services, too. Everything is under $10. This is by no means formal dining, but it's delicious and so much better because it's going to an amazing cause.   http://www.holyangelsnc.org/cherubs/menu.asp"}
{"text":"From No Culinary Backwater So what makes for great dining experience? Is it the food, the wine, the company, the setting, the atmosphere, the service, the context, the reputation the chef? Is it all of these; some of these; or is it purely subjective?  This may be a debate with no resolution. This debate may go on as long as people have been arguing about Santa Claus.  My wife and I found our way to the quaint little town of Belmont, NC for a reason unrelated to checking out the local culinary hot spots. However, we grew hungry set forth on poor little Belmont like have crazed starving locusts. Belmont was not looking too promising with their downtown dining options; a steakhouse, general store and coffee shop were our initial findings. I was not looking forward to another disappointing meal, especially coming back from Waikiki 's lackluster, tourist-trap food from our last week's trip to Oahu. This would had made the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and author of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner contemplate eating that dammed albatross.  Luckily, we stumbled across Cherubs Cafe http://www.holyangelsnc.org/open-to-serve-open-to-learn/. A clean, quiet, slightly retro 50's style soda shop/cafe greeted us as a welcome surprise in contrast to the bombastic sports bar down the street.  Cherubs has a nice simple menu and a cheerful wait staff who took our orders. My wife had the soup of the day and I had the vegetarian wrap sandwich. The meal was presented quickly but, not rushed, nicely but not over complicated plating.  The food was fresh and served at correct temperatures to ensure customers' satisfaction and for food safety reasons. Well seasoned and fresh food was a welcome relief as opposed what was found in Waikiki. So what makes for great dining experiences? Not sure I could give you a written definition, but whatever it is, Cherubs Cafe makes for one."}
{"text":"Nice small cafe in the quaint village of Belmont, NC. Delicious food reasonably priced. Awesome staff with a shout out to Katie. Wonderful mission/vision to support and be a part of."}
{"text":"Delightful little cafe that also has a great mission of providing opportunities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.   Small breakfast menu has classic plates with the usual choices (egg style, meat, toast) plus grits or potatoes. Grits were excellent. Another plate adds your choice of pancake or waffle. A nice choice for breakfast in Belmont!"}
{"text":"The Deluxe Grilled Cheese was delicious and my sister thoroughly enjoyed her city club."}
{"text":"Have to love this place, it got a recent face lift and it is very beautiful, but loud.  I do miss rhe old charm, but now very fresh and current.  The cafe is very fast and fresh, with such exceptional service.  What a great place that teaches skills to the staff.  Love the chicken salad and the best side is the carrot raisin salad with marshmallows.   Fun lunch spot in the charming downtown area and they do breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wonderful  people!  I had pancakes and sausage for my birthday breakfast and it tasted just like the pancake breakfasts my grandmother made me as a child!"}
{"text":"The staff is amazing to have a disability and be able to be so aware of the customers needs the food is great. But most of all the people working are so sweet kind and attentive to your needs will be back"}
{"text":"I first arrived there and ordered a chicken pesto wrap and they were out of pesto. Then I ordered the veggie wrap with with turkey and also 2 kids hot dogs which didn't taste heated through all the way. I didn't get the chips that were suppose to go with it and the buns on the hot dog were hard and stale. As for the wrap it had a house dressing that they put on it and the dressing has ketchup in it. The ketchup literally takes over the whole taste of the wrap. I may go back to try their breakfast but I'm very hesitant with the way our lunch turned out. We shall see. I will say that the cookies they sell are the bomb though!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast and great staff. I highly recommend for anyone in town. Liver mush was surprisingly delicious."}
{"text":"Always a good meal at Cherubs.  Love that they have fresh bread to purchase also.  The wreaths that are made out of Ribbon are beautiful along with the candy bouquets.  It helps support Holy Angels so you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"What a great find! Pleasant service, happy smiling faces, great breakfast and coffee. Quiet and quaint. Try their Xtra special potatoes! Yum! And all for a great cause."}
{"text":"When I walked into this restaurant, a patron was sitting on the bench out front.  She suggested that we try the sampler platter, which my friend Charlotte and I both did.  I had the chicken salad, raisin and carrot salad, and broccoli salad. When my order got delivered to the table (very quickly after we ordered it) it included cold slaw, but no carrot raisin salad.  Of course, I pointed this out to the server and he quickly brought a side dish of carrot raisin salad.   That meant that I was also able to munch down on the cold slaw too - an unexpected treat.   Everything I had on my plate was simply delicious.  I loved every single bite.  Some pita bread tips were included on the plate and came in handy as I scooped up the chicken salad.  I could have used a few more of those tips because there was a lot of chicken salad left over after the pita tips were gone!  The iced tea tasted freshly brewed and I had about four glasses (I may not be able to sleep tonight).   This restaurant is situated in in idyllic little town and it reminded me of my home town in Virginia.  I look forward to returning to Belmont to explore other restaurant options.  As always, the best part about the experience today was catching up with a friend that I haven't seen in ages. The Cherubs Cafe provided the perfect atmosphere for our long overdue lunch together. Two Thumbs UP!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food was great! Will return when we are back in Belmont for sure."}
{"text":"Cherubs does a fabulous job - great food, HUGE portions, and supporting a good cause - Holly Angels, a Sisters of Mercy ministry.  http://www.holyangelsnc.org/  Highly recommend!  Will be back to the shop, as well as use their catering services again. Kat Oo."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Finally got to visit for the first time this morning for breakfast. It wasn't busy at all which made it even nicer because I met up with a friend and we spent a little time catching up without feeling rushed. I ordered the Classic breakfast which came with eggs, bacon (also sausage was a choice), grits (potatoes were also a choice) and an English muffin (toast was the other choice). I had coffee with my breakfast. The food was freshly prepared and came out quickly. The coffee was hot and refills were plenty. The staff there was so nice and accommodating. The prices were on point especially knowing it helped to support such a worthy organization which helps many in the local area. Looking forward to returning again for lunch and dessert!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The chicken salad was great and the staff delightful. I went back several days later and had a wrap that was also yummy. I'll enjoy Cherub's again."}
{"text":"We've been to Cherub's several times for breakfast. It's pretty traditional bacon, sausage, eggs, grits, toast...that kind of thing. It's great! Great spot for kids too. My five year old loves it.   My wife says lunch is always great too, but I haven't been by for lunch yet. Give this spot a try!"}
{"text":"We were in Mt. Holly to check out Discover You! and asked the director for a recommendation for lunch. He suggested Cherub's Cafe as a \"place that was dear to his heart\".  How can you not follow that recommendation?  I'm glad we did!    Downtown Belmont is about four miles from downtown Mt. Holly so it was a short drive over. Belmont's downtown is very quaint with several shops, a sports bar/pub, a good looking steak restaurant ( maybe next time), and Cherub's Cafe among the shops.   Chereb's is unique which is what makes it special and \" dear to the heart\".  The cafe and adjacent candy shop are an extension of Holy Angels, an organization that works with people who are \"differently able\". Per their website, the mission of Cherub's Cafe:  \"Holy Angels owns and operates two businesses located on Main Street in downtown Belmont: Cherubs Caf√© and Cherubs Candy Bouquet. In addition to affording our Holy Angels residents and community members the opportunity to learn about each other and socialize in a fun business environment, these important ventures provide for vocational training and meaningful supported employee options. Any profits from sales are used solely to fund the programs and services of Holy Angels. Your patronage and support of these businesses is appreciated!\"  The cafe is in a restored downtown building and has a nice dinner/cafe ambiance.  The wait staff have the best smiles you'll see all day!  Their menu is pretty simple with breakfast and lunch ( they close at 5:00pm).   The lunch menu offered several sandwiches including a Ruben, a club, grilled cheese, several paninis and several wraps.  They also offer a great selection of salads.  I had the Ruben which was very good.  I ordered a side of potato salad that I'm sure was made in house.  My wife had a grilled chicken salad sandwich that I snuck a bite of (only so I could include it in this review).  It was wonderful as well.  Service is super friendly and pretty fast.  Prices are very reasonable, our bill for the two sandwiches, two sides, and two drinks was $20.  If you're near Belmont around breakfast or lunch, drop in for a bite. Not only will you have a good meal, you'll leave feeling good inside."}
{"text":"The classic was a solid breakfast. Coffee is very high quality, freshly ground on site. Not a big deal but worth mentioning It was pretty cold inside the place. Staff were the friendliest."}
