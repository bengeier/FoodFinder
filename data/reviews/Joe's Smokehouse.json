{"text":"Tried it right after they opened.  Had the brisket sandwich.  Terrible.  Very little meat.  Meat was dry and tasteless.  They offered me ketchup, mustard and relish on my brisket sandwich?????  Obviously they had no idea how brisket is prepared or served.  He offered me horseradish and I got a large dollop of relish.   Only saving grace is the fries.   Don't bother!"}
{"text":"Poorest excuse for southern BBQ in this city or any other. In a time where places like stack , triple A bar, greenwood smokehouse  and the carbon bar are emerging to give us a true Texas footprint, how could this place think with their barely edible food, that they would have a snowballs chance in Austin of ever making it."}
{"text":"Got a chance the try a New BBQ place in the East end of town. Had the Beef Brisket Sandwich, it was a leaner cut of brisket than what I'm use too but tasty all the same. I was hoping for a rack of pork ribs but they do Beef ribs instead. Since the Sandwich was a good introduction to the restaurant. I'm more than willing to give the Beef ribs a try. Four hours of smoking for the Beef ribs . Sausages are also made on site and Hamburgers ,Chicken are also smoked as well. With all these things on the menu, Can't wait to try all of them this Summer. Give it a try and tell me, what you think."}
{"text":"The best beef ribs I have ever tasted!  Moist, juicy,fall off the bone. And the wings- smoked and then grilled.not deep fried."}
{"text":"Ok. The spot is perfect for this smoke house! Gives the ol school working class vibe back to the Leslieville area. Right beside the DUKE!   We went in for  a snack. The prices are very reasonable and on the lower end for this neighbourhood.   We paid 25$ for two of us. Got fries with our 2lbs of wings and creamy coleslaw.  The wings are DELICIOUS! The best wings I have had. Bbq, saucy, fall off the bone. Lots of meat.  Fries are regular pub fries. The coleslaw - was \"off\" so we could not eat that. Tried to call to let the guy know, but voicemail is not set up :( -   So my point! The wings are a MUST have!   This would have gotten a five had it not been for the slaw.   Five stars and more for the wings! And price. Friendliness was a five as well"}
{"text":"This place was - horrible. First off, I walk into the place seeing two guys behind the counter arguing. Awkward.  Went for lunch and ordered a brisket sandwich. The guy threw what looked like an old piece of cooked meat back on the grill. I should have run away right there when I got wind of the smell (nasty like burned rubber) but I had already paid at that point.  He asked me if i wanted tomato on it, and when I said yes, he proceeded to cut one tiny but thick slice of a roma tomato and put it in the middle, which seemed really odd.  The whole tasted bland and crappy and I threw it out half-way through."}
{"text":"Got take out from here. Then platter included beef ribs, brisket, wings, fries, and coleslaw. The beef ribs, brisket and fries were delicious. This is wet-style barbecue, everything was slathered in a really delicious sauce.   The ribs are HUGE and very meaty in a fatty but crispy, fall-off-the bone way.   The brisket was more lean but still really good.   The wings were so-so, too fatty and small, about one bite of meat on each.   2 things I wish were included, a side of the sauce to dip the fries in, and some baked beans."}
