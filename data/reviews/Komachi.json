{"text":"This place probably has the cheapest sushi in the area so great value. I got take out from here and ordered the spicy salmon roll and the Wellington roll. They were not amazing, but we're pretty good. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The sashimi plate came with 2 type of fish, 4 tuna and 8 salmon! And they were not fresh. The rice was hard and over cook! I would never come back."}
{"text":"I love this place - usually get a bento box. The portions are very decent, the food is yummy and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"great food! pretty affordable and awesome service. everyone is so nice. very quick serving as well :) my go to sushi place."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Aurora and possibly in all of Toronto. The service is excellent. It's not particularly aesthetically pleasing in terms of its decor but it more then makes up for it in its sushi. My girlfriend and I have been regulars here for almost a year and wont go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Friendly service and decent Japanese food. Don't expect blue fin tuna but you do get what you pay for here. Compare to other Japanese restaurant in the area, it satisfy your Japanese food craving and it won't break your bank account."}
{"text":"This is our main place for takeout sushi.  Service is great and the sushi is fresh.  Love the fast service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for takeout & sometimes eat in. This place is a small very casual \"Japanese\" place. The owners/servers area always friendly, polite & quick. There's nothing to wow you in terms of ambience but like I said it's casual with some decor of a Japanese quick casual spot.  Now the price point is very very reasonable, for lunch or dinner. I've shown a tip for this place for their Teriyaki chicken lunch combo. It comes with a small bowl of miso soup which is really well balanced in flavour & salt. It cost only $4.95 & tax for the meal and it was very satisfying- the girl kept my green tea flowing(included) in dine in. The sushi is decent for a great price point - it's just not my go to place for sushi. I really like this place to eat in or takeout when I'm in a rush or want to have a casual laid back lunch break on my own or with friends. You can't go wrong & it feels healthier to eat this food (especially after working out at Good life) I'm giving this place 3.5stars -they lose the point's on the washroom(I don't like where they store the excess styrofoam cartons- even tho they are wrapped)."}
{"text":"This is one of the better spots to grab a meal in Aurora.  The staff are super friendly and they have pretty great price points for their lunch combos (soup/salad/veggies/small spring roll/6-piece sushi/main meal) = less than $9.  I usually get the teriyaki salmon lunch combo.  I have had better Japanese food..but considering this is Aurora I don't expect on finding greatness.  I would actually give it 3.5 stars....but 4.5 stars for their staff.  Always nice and friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"We've been going here for 10 years.  Great spot...good value and consistent quality with solid service.  You won't do better for the money."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sushi restaurant! The servers are super nice and for the price, the food is really good. If you want something affordable, this is perfect. I've gone here for years and they're always so nice! Food 8/10. Service 10/10. Cleanliness 9/10."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best value sushi joint in Newmarket/ Aurora area (thats what you want in sushi, right?). Quant dine-in area on par with the smaller joints in Markham. You can't go wrong with the party tray or a lunch special. There is a reason this place has been around for so long."}
