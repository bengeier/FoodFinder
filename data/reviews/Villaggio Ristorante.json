{"text":"I went with a party of 4. The restaurant had great atmosphere, however it was empty except one table of 10. Instead of seating us in a quiet corner we were seated right beside the party of 10. Not one to complain we let this go. The waiter then came to take our drink orders. When I asked what beers were on tap his manor changed from friendly to arrogant. Instead of suggest ing one of the bottled bears the waiter stood there smugly. I than had to prompt him for what beers they had bottled. While ordering  our meals the waiter corrected us constantly. My wife asked for capers on the side of her dish. The waiter then lectured her on how the chef wouldn't like it and you would never add cappers to such a dish. Although he may have been correct. This is no way to talk to customers. The condescending manor in which he continued to address the table soured our evening. The meals were well prepared but nothing notable. They appeared to have a decent menu with several dishes that looked interesting. However due to our experience we will not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and even better service.  Never felt this welcomed at any Italian restaurant before. Quaint place, loved it.  Will be back for more."}
{"text":"We just went to Villaggio for Savour York Region special and were very pleased with that place. The atmosphere was really nice, perfect for a date or just fine dining with friends. They have very nice views from the windows. 
Food was really good, like real Italian home made food. The service was great as well. The best tiramisu I ever had. For Italian food I would go there."}
{"text":"Mussels were very flavourful and fresh.
Rigottoni villagio was pretty good.
Tiramisu and creme brulee were very good.
High-end price range."}
{"text":"Service was ok, when you take an empty glass you should offer another which was not the case until I asked. 
 We ordered salad which was very good to start off along with a couple of glasses of wine. 
My wife ordered chicken and she said it was ok and I went with Angus Steak. Steak was very bland, came in two small pieces and it was covered in fat. 
Potatoes and veggies were ok. 
Service went downhill after this and we simply told them they forgot our drinks and we just wanted the bill. 
Live in Kleinburg and I would not go back here. 
$38 for an Angus steak and I came home and made a sandwich."}
{"text":"First time at Villaggio Ristorante.  My Dad took us out to meet my Aunt.  
It's a very nice restaurant and it's roomy.  
The Bruschetta topping that they serve with the bread was nice and fresh, yum. 
Calamari - traditional and very well made
Caprese - tomato & buffalo mozzarella, I've never seen anything like it
Pizza - they did a great a job
Cheesecake - wow, it was \"so\" fresh & light, I've never had it like that before."}
{"text":"At this family run restaurant we are made to feel like we're part of the family. Antipasto of grilled peppers and portabello mushrooms with olive oil; light, crisp calamari rings the size of bracelets; and delicately sliced veal carpaccio with a splash of lemon are a feast for our eyes and the table.

The in house made gnocchi in a light tomato basil sauce is a dreamy pairing of sweet pillow-y potato and tangy sauce. Tagliatelli, fresh green and white noodles, is enriched in a savoury wild boar Bolognese. Fresh pasta, pure Italian olive oil, authentic cooking, and familial service make this warm dining room and peaceful patio a feel-good fine dining experience just down the slope from the main street of Kleinburg."}
{"text":"1st time visit to this place and was disappointed with most of the experience. 

As soon as we walked, the noise level was overwhelming. There was an entertainer playing piano and singing at the doorway which made it difficult to hear the hostess's greeting.

We had reservations and were seated directly beside a very loud party of 15. My husband and I needed to raise out voices in order to hear eachother talk. 

Appetizer: antipasto for 2.
-tasty, good size, a little skimpy on the cheese

Mains: grilled halibut
-done perfectly, vegetables weren't what we were told they would b but a good dish

Braised short ribs: was one of the daily specials. Amazing. So tender and flavorful.

The food was very good but the atmosphere of this place was horrible enough not to return or recommend it to my friends. If ur looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, this is not the place for u"}
{"text":"Our in-restaurant experiences a few years back in 2014 were a definite 5. We since moved away so haven't dined-in since. But our very recent catering experience this holiday season was a solid 3.5. It was good, but it wasn't great or amazing, which we were expecting based on our restaurant experiences. You do get value for money in terms of pretty large portions."}
{"text":"My rabbit gnocchi came with an eyelash in it. The situation got ignored by management, when I finally asked for a manager to pass by our table at the time of paying our bill, he claimed that it is natural for rabbit fur to end up in the meat. Really? No apologies, just rude service. Never again. It was our anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Had a great meal and experience here. Waiters/waitresses were attentive, professional and friendly. Had drinks and full meal. Everyone was extremely satisfied with their order. Menu is Italian fare with a handful of daily specials. We were pleasantly surprised by their collard green soup (soup of the day) that was extremely flavourful and well balanced.  We shared an antipasto, soup and salad and had our own main meals. Prices were reasonable for the quality of plates. I would recommend for a great dinner dining experience."}
{"text":"Food is great. And tony (the owner) is great! The restaurant is in a nice spot - cute little town. 
The restaurant is family run and the passion is present."}
{"text":"Top notch food. I rarely give a 5/5 but these guys just got everything right. The specials were super expensive but the rest is priced right. Fresh. Cooked perfect. Amazing service. And the house wine is an amazing value at $28/bottle. Calamari done perfect. Steak was amazing. Risotto is fantastic. And the bread on the table is fresh. Strongly recommend for dinner. We celebrated my daughters confirmation and they allowed us to bring our own cake. They even cut it and served it for us. Amazing service.  A true gem"}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere and great service is what earns this place three stars. The food however is not that great. Risotto is too salty, salmon with the carrot pur√©e is very bland and not worth the price. Pizza came out soggy and cold with also no flavour. As far as Italian food goes, there are much better restaurants to try."}
{"text":"I became familiar with this restaurant when it was located in a plaza at Weston Rd/Rutherford area. It was one of the better restaurants in the neighbourhood and we were sad to drive by one day and the restaurant closed. Thankfully, it did not go out of business and just relocated to it's new location in Kleinburg...Highway 27/Nashville Rd in a yet another pretty non descriptive plaza. The move must have been smart on the owners part, as the new location appears to be much busier than when it was located in Woodbridge. Thankfully, the food is still the same.

The \"new\" reincarnated restaurant is gorgeous...certainly relaxing to the senses. Atmosphere is along the lines of Canyon Creek/Keg...strong woods, low lighting, etc. Surprising, considering the building it is in would never suggest a place such as this is contained inside.

Staff are friendly and knowledgable....last time the waiter made suggestions which were bang on. We've run the gambit of pastas and steaks ...never been disappointed. 

On our last visit the noise level was higher than normal as the place was jumping, partly due to the fact that the restaurant was participating in Savour Vaughan and was booked solid. If they ever participate again, book a reservation immediately and try this restaurant, it won't disappoint.

A bit on the more upscale side as far as pricing goes...but a wonderful place to dine out when romance is in the air."}
{"text":"I had low expectations given the location but was pleasantly surprised. Started w pizza as an app. They use double zero flour, pizza was perfect. Actually could be better than Terroni's. My main was veal scallopini w veggies, asked for no butter & they had no problem accommodating. Service & atmosphere was great. We had a party of 4 right before Xmas. Would go back for the pizza!"}
{"text":"Excellent boutique Italian upscale restaurant with an amazing relaxing, romantic vibe. The food was very delicious! Everything was freshly cooked and nothing was pre cooked from the sauce to the entire dish. As Vegetarians we will definitely come back. Oh yes and to top it up the staff was extremely humble and friendly."}
{"text":"A good restaurant outside the Kleinburg strip. It's hard finding Italian restaurants like this these days. I enjoyed it just for that."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here to treat him to a birthday lunch last week.  We sat on the sunny flower filled patio.

He ordered the house made gnocchi, I ordered the Sicilian pizza, we had the fried calamari to start.

The calamari was extremely fresh and done to perfection, the gnocchi slightly over done but still had great flavor, and my pizza...i'm craving more!!  Although it was a bit of a drive for us coming from the downtown core we found it well worth the drive to the picturesque town of Kleinburg for good food, good atmosphere, great eats and a little afternoon escape.

Our server was great, I noticed the server for the other tables were on the ball as well.

Overall, great experience, and we would love to come back ...perhaps to try the veal scallopini or the tiger shrimp pasta for a nice romantic dinner in the near future."}
{"text":"Villaggio Ristorante is located in the picturesque town of Kleinburg. 

Our Savour York Region 3 course lunch for $20 makes it worth our while to drive all the way to enjoy a delicious lunch with great food.

We tried:

Appetizers: 

Mussels in a Marinara Sauce
- seafood always taste best in a simple sauce.. but this one needs some seasoning and a little more depth for sure

Mixed Green
- Simple balsamic vinaigrette dressing, though some of the greens were not too fresh..

Main:

Linguine with Tiger Shrimp
- This is the spiciest pasta I ever had in my life in an Italian restaurant
- I can feel my lips all pumped up and my stomach burning after I finished 
- Tiger shrimps on the smallish side but are fresh and nicely cooked

Vietllo Villaggio Veal Scallopini
- Veal is a little dry but love the cream wine mushroom sauce...
- Veggie on the side make this a more balanced meal

Dessert:

Lemon Tart 
- Buttery crust is so delicious
- The lemon custard filling is finished off with a layer of hard caramel  
-  I like how there is a mix of texture and taste in this dessert
 
B52 Cheesecake
- According to the menu, this is a New York Style Cheesecake but this is the most fluffy and light NY cheesecake I ever had
- Sadly, I can barely taste the Kahlua, Baileys or Triple Sec though..

Great portion size for a Prix Menu. I was quite full after the menu... I think I should be?

The atmosphere here is quite cozy and welcoming. Great for a quiet lunch or a date.  Service is decent though our waiter was a little clumsy kept running into tables and chairs and even dropping a berry while serving me my dessert into my water....."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is a romantic spot and has amazing food and service!  Their pastas are homemade noodles, amazing sauces and wine list is great and reasonable.  We had their fish spaghetti which was an amazing fish sauce and generous portion of fish.  Their lobster risotto is out of this world!!  I would definitely recommend for a romantic dinner.  I would reserve the round table by the windows as in my opinion nicest table and view"}
