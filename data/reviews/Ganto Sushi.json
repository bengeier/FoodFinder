{"text":"Tentative service and their seared albacore is really good! Would go back again to try their other options :-)"}
{"text":"Okay, so I came here after walking pass it on King st. First thing I notice it smelled funky in here. Like so strong chemical cleaner.  Also there is no A/C in this place. I immediately started to sweat. Had to ask for cold ice water which the server didn't bring out until 10 mins later. There was around 5 tables (I think around 10 tables) so half full.  Only 1 server for entire place.  On to the food, the quality is okay didn't go for the sashimi as I didn't want to risk it this time.  Had some raw fish on my Red Dragon roll. This place didn't offer miso soup nor salad with your meal. If you want it it will cost you extra.  For this price point which is closer to Tone and Etsu I would not come back.  But the server did give us miso soup as she said she had extra."}
{"text":"Was really hungry after work and Ganto was close-by. Entered and seated around 6:30 on a weekday; we were the only customers. My boyfriend and I order 2 special rolls. It took over 30 minutes to serve 2 rolls to your only customers.   I've never paid $30 for 2 rolls before (bill came out to $29+ without gratuity).  That's insane.   Quality is the same as the ones you see in supermarkets; stale seaweed and tempura bits.  The hostess was very welcoming and kind.   I was glad to see they have air-conditioning. It was really hot and humid today."}
{"text":"After the adjacent sushi restaurant suspiciously closed, I decided to move my sashimi fetish (two to three times a week) to Ganto Sushi. Needless to say, it's been a one-sided relationship from the onset of the relationship, with me continuously seeking validation with little to no response or fanfare. I'm not asking for much, really, I'm not. All I want, is the correct order, fresh food, clean fish, tactful presentation, a friendly smile, a hello and a goodbye. In this day and age, am I asking for too much? I even moved my first weekly order to Tuesday, assuming and believing the product would be fresh. No, was I disillusioned? Yes friend, me, disillusioned. Yesterday was the final straw, the other shoe dropped. You see, at my organization, I provide to 70 individuals, $15 weekly in Ritual credits to buy lunch. Ritual is a great app., which makes it easy for people to remotely order food at participating restaurants, and run to the establishment and pick up their lunch. Easy right? No. Two of us ordered sashimi from Ganto Sushi, my order was an 18 piece with brown rice (apparently I have a conscious). We get back to the office, my order is a 9 piece with white rice. There goes $30. This is where it gets nasty. 30-minutes post-lunch, my fellow co-worker is violently vomiting in the stairwell trying to get to his car to go home. Fearing the absolute, I decided to cancel all my afternoon meetings and quickly made my way home via highway 404. I didn't make it. I didn't make it. Insert awkward pause. I had to make a drastic pit stop at Tim Hortons. I had to push a senior out of the way. Once finished, I thought I was in the clear, no. I had to make another pit stop at Home Depot. Although I will admit, Home Depot has great toilet paper. This is the sixth case of questionable food issues from Ganto Sushi, and they've been put on our \"do not eat at\" list in the office. I can't and will not recommend this restaurant and it's unfortunate it's located on King W. My apologies to all at Tim Hortons and Home Depot."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef teriyaki bento box and unagi sashimi. Way too little beef and it's too raw and not very fresh. Hard to digest tempura. Can still feel the greasiness after a few hours.   Really only deserve one star. Give one more star for using real wasabi and the nice lunch box."}
{"text":"Good to know if you want late night food and there is no where else... walk to the next sushi place.  Down the the street. They don't do subs, no delivery, no specials, pay for your tea.   I mean I love sushi and Praise Toronto's sushi but seriously...."}
{"text":"Ridiculous poor quality. I ordered a lunch combo A (assortment of tempura with teriyaki, salad, miso, edamame). When I got it, tempura was cold and soggy, teriyaki chicken looked like it was made from scraps. I know this is a lunch menu but this is the one that gets new customers in the door. With this mediocre dish as your first impression, you will lose a lot of repeat customers. I sure as hell won't be back."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of the sushi place next door (Sushi & Bento) but they just closed down and I'm stuck with Ganto. Their rolls are good, but nothing to write home about. Their gyoza soups are good. Their sashimi is so so. The customer service is friendly and I have never seen this place busy. So no wait times, ever. The prices are also pretty decent. So definitely would come back but in search for something better."}
{"text":"Great little place! Service was awesome. We only had appetizers, Sapporo & Sake. The beef gyoza is one of the top 2 best gyoza's that we've tried and we have tried plenty (from FL, CA, CO, NY, etc). If you LOVE gyoza then you must try theirs! It was fresh, handmade and flavorful (not frozen). The crispy scallop with bacon was cooked well and had good flavor, it needed a little sweetness IMO, but for $9.50 CAD it was well worth the price for 4 scallops. Chicken Yakitori was dark meat (our favorite), but it also lacked a little sweetness. We just used the sauce from the dumplings to supplement our preference for sweet. Great place, cozy atmosphere and great value!"}
{"text":"Came here at around 5 one afternoon and the place was empty. I see why. Typical Toronto Japanese food. Tea was served to us barely lukewarm and with no flavour. Like tapwater. Had to ask for a new pot.   Agadashi tofu was cold inside but I was so hungry I just ate it. Everything we ordered was pretty bland and the roll I got was missing avocado, a main ingredient. When I brought this to the waitress's attention she attempted to question me about it and I had to point out where in the menu it says avocado. Waited on the roll to come back properly. Also ordered a simple hand roll. Got maki instead but I was too tired by now to bother correcting this too so I just ate it.  The fish seemed fresh enough so no worries there. The rolls and presentation were not artfully prepared but managable. Clean restaurant.  The price seemed high for the amount and quality of the food. It's better than what you get at Loblaws but nothing special."}
