{"text":"Soooo... good. We had the tacos. Then we got up and ordered more tacos, vamps and mulas. Needless to say we went home FULL. I tried to order a dozen of the homemade corn shells to take home, but it didn't work!"}
{"text":"They are ok tacos.  They do get really busy and the workers seem little overwhelmed.  Just expect a long wait.  They do have tables and chairs where you can just hangout or eat.  It's just your average neighborhood taco truck.  I would come back but I'm not fully sold yet."}
{"text":"Yooo... If you haven't tried D Taco Pit, you're missin out!  Tender & flavorful meat, handmade corn tortillas can't be beat.  Put some fiery red salsa on top and mannnn... .

Great food, great service.  I'm going back for the Super Nachos!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, take cash/card, price and food portion was not bad.

I had the vampiro tacos which were very good and comes with complimentary grilled onions, limes and jalapenos. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"The best street tacos I have ever had and the super nachos are to die for literally can feed four people with just one and it's not even skipped out with the cheese or meat  it's a family owned business and they are all so sweet and so many drink choices they have jarritos  pineapple fruit punch line mineral wwater orangeCoke big Coke Sprite water diet coke"}
{"text":"New into town.. lots of taco shops closes early or miles away, found this place on yelp and took a chance. GLAD I DID! Handmade tortillas, sauces and the meat are great! It's also 5-10mins away which is a plus. Seems like it's a family business, you should definitely check them out and support :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  Really great food!!!!   Guacamole is delicious, the al pastor melts in your mouth and super flavorful.   Carne asada was tasty as well. Family run food truck that really takes care of it's customers. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been out of town and telling my other half I really want to try these tacos after seeing the posts on FB, when I get back home. So, what does he do...  He goes without me while I was still gone. Tonight, guess what he treated me to... D Taco Pit!!! The great reviews are spot on! Delish, delish, delish! We both ordered three each, and then we ordered three more to share! Did I say the we're DELISH?  Yes, they really are that good!"}
{"text":"Yoooo Aye 
These tacos are fuego I'm picky on my Hispanic food but this is the best I've had & only tacos I would tell other people to come thru. Juicy & handmade from the meat to the tacos. God bless to these D Tacos."}
{"text":"Have to say we needed a taco spot in Laveen. The food is fresh, the pastor is cooked on a trompo. The guac is good the salsas are good to, wish they would have stayed on Baseline worth the drive though. And the waiters are so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I went today after work. I wanted to try it out. They have a small selection but the tacos are really good. Pastor, and asada. I also had a quesadilla. That was good. The guy working is also very approachable. Good customer service."}
{"text":"Love the handmade tortillas, the green and red sauce are spectacular. Very friendly and prompt. Nachos were also good"}
{"text":"We saw them setting up near or house and decided to stop by and try it... Best choice! Everyone that worked there was really nice and helpful. The food was delicious. We ordered tacos, a mula (one corn tortilla on bottom with meat, cheese, onion in the center and another corn tortilla on top) and the nachos. All three were really good. The best part homemade corn tortillas! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and tacos were amazing. They provide a decent portion of juicy and flavorful meat on their homemade corn tortillas topped with guacamole, cilantro, and onions. I was hesitant at first due to the price, but was very pleased during and after I consumed my al pastor and carne asada tacos. D Taco Pit provides great quality food. This will definitely be my new taco spot on the south side of Phoenix."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Laveen! We were looking for authentic Mexican food in the area and found this delicious food truck. I recommend the Tacos al pastor and also the mulas. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great taco truck and exactly what we needed in the area. Definitely will be coming back. Gotta try them."}
{"text":"The corn tortillas are what make the tacos great! Handmade and Fresh. That orange pepper on the side is very spicy."}
{"text":"We saw this taco truck driving by and decided to stop and get some diner. We ordered carne asada tacos, al pastor tacos, and carne asada mulitas. We took our order to go and everything looked delicious. I read the reviews on our way back and was very excited especially about the pastor tacos as they actually cook it on a trompo. My SO and I were quite disappointed with the food. It seemed that everything lacked flavor. The tortillas were bland, the meat was bland, even the guacamole was flavorless. The only thing that had some flavor was the mulitas which were given flavor by the cheese. I did like their salsas. I gave them 2 stars because everyone was very nice and as a teacher I was happy to see that they are #RedforEd supporters. Idk if they had a bad day or what but I'll likely give them another shot and update my review."}
{"text":"Best joint in the Southside with good price food and drink... Perfect for those late night weekends since they open til 2"}
{"text":"Classic food truck tacos, fresh hand made tortillas, their pastor is scrumptious and the carne asada is well seasoned.
Ordered the quesadilla with steak, the cheese was melty and the tortilla was perfectly crunchy!
Highly recommend it, salsas are tasty not too spicy with the right amount of kick.

Overall great and quick service. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I went yesterday the service was great and the food was delicious I had a taco and  steak quesadilla my husband had the pollo quesadilla and two tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos are really delicious. Great customer service, very welcoming. They are on their feet coming to you and make sure you got all you need. The kid even sat down with us and had a conversation with us and asked us about our day. No waiting a long time for you to get your food. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This isn't a 5 Star fancy restaurant...it's a food truck.  So be ready an outside meal.  They keep clean picnic tables with chairs and it's super clean!  Carne Asada is flavorful and super soft.  So far everything I've tried has been packed in flavor, green salsa is a must have on your food!  Also great to see a family run business, you get to see the kids serving and working with customers."}
{"text":"Tacos are bomb!!! Freshly pressed tortillas, and best part is the people. Vampiros are super crunchy and tacos are crazy good."}
{"text":"Delicious, the tacos were great, the whole family loved the tacos, would come again, 7 days a week!"}
{"text":"These tacos are delicious and the corn tortillas are the best! They always have fast and friendly service too."}
{"text":"Very good and fresh. They have great customer service. I love these tacos. You will think you are eating in Mexico at a taqueria."}
{"text":"Ridiculous lines for unflavored tacos plus the lady helping had such a bad customer service and attitudes, I ask her 2 for my food and the 2 times she keep sayin you have to wait 45 min I let pass 40 min and she said same thing and respond in such a rude place I'll rather drive to 19 ave and broadway to the taco place next to circkle k those tacos are the bomb.com"}
{"text":"Yum! Homemade tortillas, BEST al pastor, carne asada very good but can improve. I hope they find a permanent location so I can frequent it more. I DO recommend!"}
