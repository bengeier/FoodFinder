{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night around 12am and it was surprisingly empty. We shared udon and 2 rolls. Food was average, nothing extraordinary. However, would give 5/5 on the dining environment as it was extremely cozy and modern and definitely made the experience more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"It's official.  We are hooked and will be back.

We agree with fellow yelpers.  We love the following:

1) Sake.  2oz special bottle.  Melon, papya favour.  Yummy.

2) Ankimo.  Good recommandation.  Love the texture.  But be warn, strong fishy after taste.

3) Kaki Age with Shrimp.  Vegetable and shrimp tempura.

4) oh, we like their deep fry salted pasta snack....they gave us extra when we were waiting for more food to come, extremely friendly staff

5) Mikazuki.  15 piece sashmi, 12 piece sushi and maki.  We were surprise to see scallop sashmi

6) hamachi wara yaki.  We suspect they use charcol grill, smoky flavour stayed on the fish, love it.

We were so full after, party of 2... $60 all in.  My huby order a beer as well."}
{"text":"Sushi was alright. No where on the menu did they mention that their sushi was not made with regular sushi rice. 

We came at around 11pm on a Friday night and were one of three tables seated. Service was extremely slow and the server was almost rushing us to order. 

It is really pricey compared to kinka/guu.

Probably will not be returning in the near future.."}
{"text":"Just came here with my friend for our lunch this afternoon. Stepping into the restaurant, I already felt liking this place where it provides a quiet and very delightful ambiance. It's so perfect to hang out with friends in a nice restaurant and with good meal...

We ordered two lunch combos: one sushi and sashimi combo and one salmon teriyaki combo. They're served with miso soup, salad and steamed veggies or tempura. Even though the waiting time was a little bit longer than other restaurants but all the food came out so fresh and delicious. I found it's really worth for the waiting time especially the steamed veggies-sooooo yummy with its special sesame dressing. I really like it and it became the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"Gave us the wrong order and charged us for it at the end. We ordered a small party tray but received a medium"}
{"text":"Fantastic place, high quality food, good portions and option of doing steamed veggies instead of tempura. I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad. The sashimi was fairly fresh and a good price. However the drinks (both on the cocktail menu and mixed) are horrible. The 'Cosmo' was 1:1 lime juice and vodka. It was absolutely gross. The highball is unpleasant as well. Service was also substandard and fairly slow. It took me almost a half hour to get my miso soup. I've come to expect that in the first 5 after ordering. Wouldn't repeat. Don't advise you give them your money."}
{"text":"Overall was good, except the Cheese Buldak, too spicy and salty.  Reasonable price, great quality food, for sure I will come again."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Japanese restaurant in the 905 area. Awesome service, great location and excellent menu at a decent price. Can't ask for anything better!"}
{"text":"High quality sushi sashimi and rolls with decent price. I get some chef specials on the house everytime I have bottles of beer and sake."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for a late night snacks.  
Best thing is this place close at 2am everyday.  Which is great!  Where else close that late in Richmond Hill.  Thumbs up for that.  
We ordered couple if dishes to share. 
1) poutine with terriyaki sauce ans shaved cheese.
 Too little cheese,  gravy is just Terriyak sauce.   It was OK.  probably not gonna order that again.
2) Buta Negi 
It was very nice.  Must order to try.
3)  California rice bowl
I like it.  I will order again next time.  
4)  wahsabi octopus
Interesting.  I have never had it. It was interesting.. 
5) netto dish... (I forgot what it was call)
I think i had better one at FIN Izakaya.  

I will come back to try again."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere. I found it very calming and traditional. I ordered squid and it was very fresh and tasty! Prices in the menu were fair. I'll definitely go again"}
{"text":"Wow!

The place was smaller than expected.  The parking lot isn't as convenient as compared to the other restaurants in the area.

We were lucky to get a seat right away.

The food was amazing.  The waitresses were very fast (and cute).

I don't usually have Sashimi at Izakaya restaurants but I did tonight and it was very fresh.
The Maguro Tataki was great.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am not a person to write reviews on restaurants.  I always read them but have never felt the need to share how awesome a place was, until today.  

We went to Tsuki Izakaya.  The manager was incredibly awesome! So nice,  he kept giving us free snacks to try with our polar beers.  They are one of the few restaurants in Toronto that carries sapporo Polar beer.  It's beer with a frozen beer flavored head that keeps the beer ice cold until the last drop.  As for the snacks,  they have the best black cod I have ever tasted.  I'm not foreign to sushi,  I actually go out for it pretty regularly, but this cut of cod (that was cooked)  was so tender and flavorful that we both ordered a second helping.  Basically,  you need to try this place."}
{"text":"Very poor service. The wait staff came and took one of our menus (there were two of us) away before we decided on our main course!! We only sat down for 5 minutes. No, they were out of menus, he just stashed it back onto their full stack. One of our appetizers was sashimi salad, which we didn't finish cos the fish was fishy. We didn't order maincourse in the end and went to another restaurant for our proper dinner instead"}
{"text":"I loved the sushi rice! It's purple :) 

It was fairly late and we were looking for a restaurant that was still open. Thankfully, we found this place and were blown away by how fresh and delicious their sushi is. 

Our server didn't seem to understand my drink order (gin and soda), so it took a few tries until she got it - but that's ok. She was very nice and gracious, and the food made up for any miscommunication in the beginning. 

They are open till 2am, which is awesome for late-night sushi cravings! I definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"great atmosphere. fresh food. It's a good option on the plaza. Make sure you order one of their sake bottles.."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, I think we waited around 30 minutes for our order but the food was good. We had the cheese buldak, spicy salmon bowl and the tomaguro dragon roll. I liked all three, and surprisingly the tomaguro dragon roll was really good despite the tuna and tomato combination. I feel like tsuki changed the menu and the bowls available since the last time I can here. The bowl here really hit my craving."}
{"text":"It's okay, buttered squid is so good, and nice touch with appetizer soup."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today, friendly staff, very attentive, food was good.  Would have took pictures, but was too hungry!!"}
{"text":"A pretty solid Izakaya! Tsuki Don is affordable and good. Pictured menu, to make ordering easier."}
{"text":"I found out about this place when a review of it was the featured review on day on Yelp.  We went on a bitterly cold Saturday night and as it turns out we were lucky we went early (6:30) as when we were leaving they were going to have to close early due to the heat not working properly and the water not working.  Despite these handicaps, we still received an excellent meal that was tasty and very enjoyable.  There were even magic tricks at the end of the meal.   Since this is an Izakaya, they don't serve entries but plates for sharing.  I picked the beef tataki, the okonomi yaki, and tako yaki.  My husband picked the salmon tataki, seafood pancake, and tonkatsu tamago toji.  I ate all the beef and he ate all the salmon, but the rest we shared.  The beef tataki was excellent, not the best I have ever had but close.  The okonomi yaki was a bit different from the one I have had before but was still quite good.  I had heard of tako yaki before but never had it, and now I hope I get to have it again.  The seafood pancake was HUGE, easily enough for more than just the two of us.  It was very tasty with lots of seafood and a good dipping sauce.  The tonkatsu tamago toji was a twist on the traditional tonkatsu which is topped with an egg and udon broth.  I have tonkatsu many times so it was nice to see it taken in a new direction other than just the fired cutlet with katsu sauce.  My husband said the salmon tataki was very good as well.  We finished with the black sesame ice cream which was quite excellent, even if it looks like a lump of ashes. 

Bottom line is I like the place and their food.  I would definitely go again.  The only real negative is they do not have their own parking lot, you have to park at one of the places across the street and walk to it.  We parked at the Tilted Kilt which seemed to have the closest spaces."}
{"text":"The portion looked small at first but it was definitely filling and tasty. My husband and I ordered butter squid, sushi and sashimi combo, fire and ice rolls and mochi green tea ice cream. It was filling and tasty."}
{"text":"I liked that the place had signs outside showing their menu selections (but not the prices) so I could get a sense of what they had. I ordered the takoyaki and yam rolls and was surprised at the amount of food for the price. From my 2 dishes I liked the yam rolls a lot, great stuff! My cowokers all got different stuff, like a bento box, katsu curry, and some sushi rolls, all their stuff looked nice as well. I liked that they made things with purple rice, my first time seeing that. I would go back for lunch again and order a bento box, they look awesome. Service was a bit slow but that's because there was only one waitress working."}
{"text":"My favorite was the Tsuki Don. The bibimbab is pretty decent too. That purple rice is so good!

PS: All of their dishes come with the purple rice, don't order it as a side dish cuz then its just a bowl of rice hahaha."}
{"text":"Amazing ! I loved the ambience . The Food was delicious , we were 7 and everything we ordered was excellent and fresh ! Service and price very good . We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Tsuki Izakaya on Sat night and were surprised that it wasn't very busy. The food was very good: we started with Miso asparagus and Taco wasabi, then shared Karai seafood (the shrimps were a bit overdone), and finished the meal with black sesame ice cream. The service was friendly and the prices were quite reasonable. We will likely come back soon and try other dishes. 
Note, that there are many restaurants in this area and they all have common parking, it took us almost 10 min to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"2.5
This place uses purple rice in their sushi. While people may appreciate this as they think it's a healthier alternative to white rice, it just shows how inauthentic it is. 
I spent $100 there between me and my boyfriend and there wasn't a single thing we enjoyed. 
Sashimi is weak, rolls are weak, and their poutine sucked. 
Oh yah, they have frozen beer as well. My boyfriend hated it.  

Music is really loud here too. Not a place where you bring your family or a place to have a private conversation."}
{"text":"So far..... average at best.  Seared tuna seems pre prepared.   Tuna was OK,  Sushi chefs look about 20-25.  Music is a little gangsta. 

Menu looked really good, as did the pics on yelp.   

Trying chicken teriyaki.   We'll see.  Teriyaki is excellent.   Though meat, and very tasty 

Unfortunately t he waitress seEmma to have forgotten about me. 

I'll agree with Lisa C.... paling a little tough, and is a kind walk in the rain.

Probably won't be back.   Even if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"I officially have a new \"Go To\" sushi spot in Markham / Richmond Hill. They have something for everyone - amazing sushi/sashimi, Korean and Japanese dishes. The dishes are perfect for sharing so come with some friends. 

The servers were very efficient and friendly. The tea was refilled quickly, food arrived quickly and they asked multiple times if we were OK. I should note that the restaurant was probably only at 20% capacity as we arrived right at opening. 

As we finished our meal, I noticed things were slowing down quickly as it got busier. Two servers are not enough to work the door, the bar and complete restaurant table service (although they tried). I felt bad for two servers, they were literally running from table to table to bar to kitchen. Hope management adds some more staff.

The food was excellent. Like most Izakaya's the dishes are suited to sharing. We tried the following:

1) Kinoko Butter Itame - Mushrooms grilled in butter and oyster sauce. Great if you like mushrooms but I think I would prefer the dish without the butter.

2) Sashimi Salad. The sashimi is incredibly fresh - arguably the best in the Markham / Richmond Hill area. Only negative I would raise - only salmon & tuna sashimi are used, a little more variety would be cool.

3) Maguro Tataki - Lightly seared tuna sashimi served with salad and a fantastic dressing. They suggest you eat the salad and sashimi together. Simply delicious.

4) Mangetsu Sushi combo - The clear highlight of the evening. You get 14 huge pieces of sushi with incredible variety including Salmon, tuna, butter fish, Unagi, scallop, ebi, white tuna / seared tuna. The combo is served with 6 california rolls (bonus - they use the purple Korean rice). At $18, this is incredible value given the size of the pieces and amazing fish freshness. No cheap imitation crab sushi pieces in this combo!       

I really look forward to my next visit. Given the broad menu selection, you can really mix things up. Combined with the great atmosphere and friendly service, I foresee myself becoming a regular very quickly....

BK"}
{"text":"Sashimi specially the salmon is ayce quality, don't worth the price. 

The roll is nice, like they use purple rice instead white rice for the roll. More filling than the rice such is prefect! 

I believed I won't come back if I'm not near by."}
{"text":"I went here for a quick Dinner on Monday night. 

I had a seaweed salad and the grilled squid. My husband had a spicy salmon roll and chicken teriyaki. 

Everything was good, particularly the spicy salmon roll. The grilled squid was a bit too chewy. 

They had a pretty large cocktail and sake selection, but we didn't have any."}
{"text":"Only ever been to another Izakaya once, so that was kinda what I was expecting when I walked in. The staff didn't really greet us as we came in, only the hostess and 1 chef yelled out. Seats were quite comfortable in our booth, but the overall lighting was a bit on the dim side, as it became hard to read the menu.

We ended up trying quite a few things on the menu. The beef, tuna, and salmon tataki really stood out, as they were seasoned and prepared perfectly. The purple rice with the sushi and maki were especially unique, with a distinct sweetness that you don't get with white rice. It did take forever to make and get to the table. Sashimi was quite fresh as well! Lastly, the yellowtail fin was amazing, cooked very nicely where the meat was soft inside, and skin was just a little crispy!

Service was a bit lacking, as it took some effort to wave down a server. Had to ask many times just to get a refill on tea! A solid 3 for the overall experience."}
{"text":"When it comes to Izakaya, I think of loud and lively Japanese pub-like restaurants, accompanying bite size, tapas-style portion food. Here at Tsuki Izakaya, I'm surprised to learn that they are quieter than most Izakayas I've been to. It's good to have a change of ambience as I find the bustling noises could make it difficult to have a conversation. I came on a Sunday and it wasn't busy at all. The portion of their food was quite generous as an Izakaya and also slightly pricier in comparison. They have a diverse menu, including both Japanese and Korean dishes, rice, sushi rolls, sashimis and grilled meat.

Tsuki Don was definitely my fave with generous amount of fresh, diced sashimis. Imagine California roll but deconstructed into a bowl of rice. My second was the Cheese Buldak, very appetizing and zesty on the hot plate with lots of melting cheese. If you enjoy spicy food, this will be a great one to try. I find the food in Tsuki is decent but lacks creativity in general. So, if you are looking for something inspiring, unfortunately you might not find it from the menu at Tsuki. Overall, their food was still great and filling. I would come back if I'm in the area but it wouldn't be something I crave for."}
{"text":"The dishes we ordered were good. But nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"I came here just last week and for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.  The server was nice and knowledgeable about the menu and suggested some items for us to try as she said many others have enjoyed.  Service was prompt and the quality of everything was fantastic even late at night and the restaurant wasn't very busy.  I ordered a shrimp dish with crunchy shrimp chips alongside (sorry I don't remember the names), as well the spicy salmon salad bowl alongside a spicy ramen soup topped with bbq pork and half a perfectly boiled egg.  Everything was delicious down to last bite.  It was also the chef KU's birthday and he was greeted with some cake by his friends of which he shared with my girlfriend and I - it was so sweet of him!!  Overall that was a special night and I couldn't have asked for a better experience let alone satisfaction. . Definitely coming back with my friends for round two with the hot sake !!"}
{"text":"Came here because google claimed it was 4 stars. 

My bf and I got the Butter Squid, Sashimi/ maki dinner 29.00$, and Tsuki Maki Roll. Generally I felt that the menu was small with little selection. Sort of confusing as well because of how many photos there were scattered allover the place. 

Cleanliness wasn't really there in terms of the restaurant. The glasses and plate wear were greasy and not washed properly. 

Service was very casual, not really any followup with us upon receiving the food. I wasn't disappointed but I also wasn't impressed by this place. It felt like a 24/7 type of restaurant lol. They had nice hotel spa music on which made it feel posh and nice.

Other than those factors let's move to the food. The squid wasn't cooked all the way, still had some flour mushy taste to it, however the sauce was good. The Tsuki roll has the purple Korean rice topped with Aburi style flame seared scallops which was good tasting. The sashimi id say wasn't the best quality and freshness. They do need to work on that. Plus the presentation needs some help. Was given a chipped plate . 

I would have rather spent my 85$ at Matsuda, there quality was maybe a little below the AYCE restaurant."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch with my family, great good deal. 
The only issue I have with this restaurant is that it only offers lunch during weekday (closed during weekend lunch) and it's at the corner so not too many people would notice.
Food wise, I've tried many different items on the menu - special lunch and other causal plates. 
I am impressed that all their sushi are made with purple rice, normally you have to pay extra in other restaurants to have this option. And for bento boxes, you get to pick steam veggies or tempura veggies.
Causal plates that I've tried are pretty amazing, such as Calamari, Okonomi Yaki, Dynamite Roll, California Don, Sashimi are tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times, and each time, I have had a great time. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is always good. 

In terms of the atmosphere, it has always been a nice cozy place. Not to loud, and not too soft. TVs are everywhere playing sports and other stuff. To tell you the truth, I don't really pay attention to it, so I'm not sure what exactly is playing. 

The food is amazing. All the fish is fresh, and the presentation is very nice. One complaint that I do have is the sushi that I ordered. The slice of fish was extremely small. It looked like it was made for children. 

Stating that, I need to apologize for not providing pics. I don't know how you guys do it, but I usually forget or by the time I get my phone out, people would have already started eating the food. You guys must be quick with the phone. 

Overall, it is a great restaurant that I would love to go back to again. 

Pros

Great Food,
Nice atmosphere,
Tvs for distractions if necessary

Con

Sushi portions are on the small side."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time on my birthday with my friends based on Yelp reviews. Can't say it is a bad restaurant but I've experienced better.

The location is alright. I would say that overall it is located in a good area, situated more or less in Richmond Hill but not too far from downtown Markham. It is located in a plaza with a lot of different variety of restaurants and it can be very hard to find the restaurant especially at night and if you don't already know your way around this plaza then you'll find yourself driving in circles. 

Dishes are pretty good. I'd say the quality of food is slightly higher than other Japanese places. Had their purple rice for the first time and it tasted great! Prices were a tad more expensive than average but the yummy food made up for it. 

Service was great; staff was very friendly and greeted you upon entrance and exit. 

I'd most likely return but it probably isn't the top Japanese restaurant that I'd recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Definitely a repeat for lunch.  

Great ambiance for a lunch date with friends. 

Seating is very spacious and feels clean.  
Food was appealing to the appetite and looks healthy, and good size. 
Service was decent but expect a little small wait time for food to be served.  
Price is a must go for for its location,  renovation and food taste."}
{"text":"Been to the one at North York and definitely liked that better. Good selection of food, but pricey (as with all izakaya). Service was good as we were the only table at the time. Will probably go back again."}
{"text":"I loved the interior design of the place!  The sushi chefs were positioned on a higher platform so as to be able to oversee all the customers, it looked like.  The restaurant's seating was arranged into quadrants with wooden partitions between each party.  It was so nice!

We ordered a lot of izakaya dishes to share.  I loved the variety of food we had at this meal.   There were both Japanese and Korean items on the menu.  They offered items like sushi, udon, ramen, nabe (hot pot), okonomi yaki, and lots of izakaya small dishes.

The Edamame was the first to arrive.  I was pleasantly surprised with how large the portion was.  The beans were a bit hard for my taste at first.

The Nagasaki Chanpon was a large pot of pork broth with veggies, pork, and seafood.  You could add noodles to it too.  This was great for a cold winter's day.  The pork broth was sooo flavourful and delicious!!!  I didn't expect that at all.  The amount of seafood in it was generous too.

I haven't had Okonomi Yaki in a while.  This one was pretty good.  It had the Japanese mayonnaise on it and was sweet and tarty.  It had slices of pork on it too.

The Karaage was just okay to me.  It was crispy and looked good but lacked seasoning for my taste.  It came with a light green onion soy sauce too.

I also ordered an item from the nabe section.  This Tamago Mushi was a Korean style steamed egg with shrimp in it!  There was a bit of clear broth in it too which was really good.  Comfort food to the max!

Last but not least I wanted to try their Tsuki Roll.  When it arrived, I was surprised to see that the roll was made with purple rice instead of typical white rice.  This was a sold roll; the size was not too big and the raw scallop on top of the dynamite roll was just to my liking.  

I liked this meal and definitely wouldn't hesitate to return in the future.  The service was really attentive too; the server kept coming by our table to see if we needed anything and to clear empty dishes from our table."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 7.  The atmosphere is very nice, perfect lighting, wine/beer bottles all around.  The menu is very wide.  Lots of special items that you do not find in other Japanese restaurants (which have turned into buffets).  Prices are not too bad.  $10-16 per dish.  We ordered the medium sushi platter, which was huge.  As well as pork bone soup (very good), scallop roll, chicken yakisoba (delicious), pork cutlet, udon soup, and sashimi salad (fresh, delicious).  The sushi platter was so huge, we actually took home about 20 pieces of sushi (probably won't be as tasty as fresh at home).  

Food was delicious (as mentioned in other reviews, they use purple rice.  which I love, more healthy and seems softer?), price was decent, I have nothing bad to say about this place.  Maybe they can wipe the floors a bit more (kinda sticky) and parking is HORRIBLE, but that's not their fault.   Because its at that circle where tons of restaurants are situated (Jack Astors, Brewery, etc) all fighting for dinner parking spots.

I'll upload some photos, but there's already 477 of them here LOL.

I would definitely come back.  Good restaurant for friends to have a good time."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed this place. The food was great, servers were nice, but service was a bit slow. Took us a while to flag the servers down to get a drink.. overall a nice place to stay, eat and chat! I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"The lighting is so bright that I  feel like a celebrity eating izakaya. Way too many pot lights and they gave me a headache. Moving on, we ordered one bottle of sake and small sake with snacks. On the bill, the total value doesn't show the 18% but when they return our change, they took the 18%.

They did not disclose this on the menu but the waitress verbally told us gratuity is 18% for party of 6 or more.

They hardly provided any service and never asked if we needed to refill water, no service and expecting an 18%?!?! I don't think this is acceptable. 

My friend was asking for a mocktail, even that they didn't seem to understand. The waitress's response was \"I am new\"  The chicken karage was poorly battered, it tasted like the Chinese fried fish with corn, except this is chicken with no corn sauce.

Overall a poor experience not even deserving of one star! Ambiance, food, service, I can't find anything good."}
{"text":"First time here. I wasn't sure if I should go in as it looked expensive. I changed my mind when I looked at their menu outside.

$10.99 pitcher after 10pm. Nuff said! I ordered sashimi and it was fresh & delicious. Wonderful service and great prices. Posh decor, personally I'm not a fan of their cubicle like design and I prefer a more open place.

Great for date nights and meeting up with friends."}
{"text":"Servers are very friendly, made reservations twice and the waiter remembered who I was by my voice. The sashimi is fresh, scallops were very good- they garnished it with a mayo that complimented it very well. The beef sashimi was done tastefully and very flavourful but not over powering. The sushi was done with a purple rice, which was still very pleasing. The presentation is nice, food arrived at a good time. Is definitely a favourite!"}
{"text":"Got seated immediate on a Friday at 7pm. However the place filled up later in the evening. The Korean styled rice (aka purple rice) used in the sushi was defiantly the highlight of my visit. It added extra sweetness to every piece. The butter squid was also a favourite of mine; defiantly try it. Other than that nothing else really jumped out at me and the sashimi wasn't the freshest (could just be that day). Overall my tastebuds wasn't too impressed, but the visuals and presentation of the dishes were excellent. Also wished they filled up my drink more often without having to ask. To me this is a one hit wonder; worth a visit but not worth a repeat."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and my first visit just ok from what I remember. 

After 10pm they have $11 pitchers or $5 pints! What? That is almost unheard-of! 

It's an izakaya, but Korean run, so there is Korean influence in some of their dishes. We ordered the spicy pork appetizer which was fantastic, it's got some heat so get ready. 

And the spicy salmon and spider roll combo, both rolls were really good. They used purple rice on the salmon roll, and a good heaping of that Sriracha mayo! 

The service is friendly and we're always walking around ready to be called upon. 

Why not a perfect rating? I think as good as the food was, the price is a bit high for what you get. I'm comparing to Guu,  their priced aren't the cheapest either but they are more authentic in the izakaya department of food options and overall atmosphere. 

But for Richmond Hill /Markham there aren't many options for izakayas. I'm glad I gave them another shot!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Service was slow. The fact that they told you right before you ordered that they will add 18% gratuity to your bill because it's a party of 6, uncool. They should have told us when we made reservation on the phone. If service is good, not a problem but the service we had totally not attentive. Will not go back."}
{"text":"My favourite place to get poke in markham, although they don't really call it poke.  It's named the Tsuki Don and consists of salmon, purple rice, avocado (my fave), seaweed, crab meat and Japanese mayo.  Normally the Tsuki Don has an assorted selection of raw fish but I only get it with salmon (beware though, they add an extra charge of 3 dollars to change it).  

The other things I get here are ok.  It's your typical Izakaya affair.  My friend got the Oyster Kaki, which was deep fried and battered oysters.  It was a heavier dish, but what you expect from what you order.

Tsuki Don is the best though."}
{"text":"Finding parking in this food community is the worst. Its always packed and you'll be circling quite a few times unless luck is on your side.

Been here quite a few times and its pretty decent for an izakaya in richmond hill. its not as loud and lively as kinka (aka Guu) but you don't have to talk very loud to carry a conversation.

Service is pretty good too. 

lots of variety for food but wished they had yakitori (grilled meat skewers) too!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, this review is coming from what I can remember of this meal because for some reason I thought it'd be a great idea to get lit off of the Green Grape Soju..... 

Tsuki's environment is a nice, dim (I'm thankful for this place being dim since my asian glow was gloooowing) and loud like any Izakaya would be. 

We got seated quickly upon arrival and the menu was quite large to our surprise. From tapas to sushi I was very excited for what they had. 

We started off with the Salmon Tataki and it tasted good, what I liked was that it didn't have the overly seared edges and was on the edge of still being sashimi. The salad it came with paired great with each other! 

We then got the Kaki Fry and it came with a purple tartar sauce, it was pretty cool how it's a lot of their dishes come purple! The oysters didn't have a nasty seafood taste and I liked how they cut the pieces into smaller bite size pieces too. 

Then we got the Beef Balsamic Steak, this I wasn't too big of a fan of because the steak was cooked to well and it was really dry. 

Lastly we got two rolls. The Jorogumo Spicy Spider Roll and The Crunch Roll. At this point I was near drunk and I couldn't eat much anymore so I had like a bite of each, can't give my honest opinion because I don't remember it. 

Overall it was good, wouldn't be my first place in mind for Izakaya but it wasn't that bad!"}
{"text":"Izakaya Tsuki is located on the second round about in this plaza, in the same building as 3 Brewers. Entering into Tsuki, the environment was rather spacious with beautiful bottles of wine located on the shelves that divide up the cubbies. There's a bar that guests can sit on for food or for drinks.

Coming here for the first time, I ordered a Tsuki Don ($13), the spicy dragon roll ($15) and the Saba no Shio Yaki ($8). The Tsuki Don uses red/purple rice and is topped with a mixture of seafood slices such as crab meat and diced cubes of raw fish such as salmon, tuna, etc. I loved this dish, as it was filling and rather large! My friend got the spicy sashimi bowl, which was even larger and came with a bowl of rice on the side and it was only $14. 

We shared the spicy dragon roll which was a large roll with red rice, tuna on the top. It was wrapped with shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, and if I remember correctly, crab meat. I loved how the red rice was used and this roll was actually monstrous. It impressed me how the sushi stayed together, despite the size of the roll.

Lastly, the Saba no Shio Yaki was delicious. It was grilled to a great temperature, though I think I would prefer it more if it was served a little hotter. 

This is one of the best Izakayas in uptown Markham!"}
{"text":"Ordered their Udon, seared sushi, tobiko sushi and their nagachampon ramen. 

The taste was not too too bad if you ate everything quickly. But it all came at once that we had to leave our sushi to the last. 

The udon tasted fresh but the tempura sprinkles were all soggy and looked like my bowl was made for a while and just sat there while all the dishes were being made. But if that was the case they should have just served it in the first place. 

The ramen tasted good, not too salty and spiced just the right way. 

But since we left the torched sushi for last, maybe it didn't taste as fresh as it should have been. It tasted almost old even though it hadn't been left untouched for more than hour after reaching out table. 

Taste was ok, the aesthetics was great."}
{"text":"Summary: late night spot has a variety of options, but they're mostly lackluster tasting in a dim setting, mediocre service, and higher prices... Except $11 pitchers and $5 pints after 10 pm - THAT'S solid.

Top Must-Get: $11 pitcher/$5 pint after 10 pm
Top Regret: pork bone soup 

*This review applies to the late night dining experience, not the lunch which is apparently better...

Location pro tip: it's beside 3 Brewers!

We came here in a group of 8 around 9:30 pm on a Wednesday. It was empty when we walked in, and stayed that way for most of the night.

We were seated right away. First complaint? Some of their lights have burnt out. It's already a darker restaurant, but with some of the lights out, some of us had trouble even reading the menu. We eventually shuffled seats among ourselves to accommodate those who were particularly affected.

Second issue? The food took a while to get there and ultimately was mediocre.

Sushi had the novelty of coming with purple rice, which was the highlight. Otherwise, it was \"comparable to supermarket sushi\".

The Pork Kimchi Duruchigi consists of Kimchi, pork, vegetable stir fried together with hot sauce and garlic, and was fairly tasty, with the spice driving out the sourness of kimchi - but definitely overpriced at $14 (it would've been a good buy at half the price). Sadly, if you like your kimchi flavour, you won't taste much of it here (but hey, I don't love it, so I was just fine!)

In fact, pretty much everything is pricey here. A small plate of karaage runs for $7, and while it's well seasoned and crunchy, there were only a few (7-8) small pieces. Not worth it.

One of us ordered the pork bone soup. We jokingly said he might be the first to order it at this restaurant and when the waitress overheard, she sheepishly admitted it wasn't too popular.

Three bites in and he was regretting it, sardonically declaring he was a fool for even trying.

Tzuki's saving grace, in my opinion, is the extensive Japanese and Korean drink selection, and their solid deal of $11 pitchers after 10 pm.

If you're looking to satisfy a food craving though, I'd probably pass."}
{"text":"Party of 11. Amazing food. Ordered small Maki platter, small sashimi and Maki platter, grilled octopus, tempura, kalbi, tuna tataki, beef tataki and lots of other dishes as you can imagine as its Izakaya. No complaints at all here. Prices average. 

Service is a negative score. Informed server of nut allergies and server ensured us no nuts at all on facility.  first plate that came out was beef tataki with peanuts sprinkled on top. Big thumbs down. Insensitive and not customer oriented.

Brought a cake to restaurant as mother's day treat. . They didn't mention a service fee nor did they say we cannot bring outside food. They recieved it and refrigerated it with no questions  or comments. So thought no problem. 
 meal done, asked for cake and server brought to table in tied up box that we brought it in, we had to ask for plates, forks and knife 3 times with server storming off rolling eyes and big puffing breaths to finally bring it to our table. Paper plates, plastic forks and plastic knife. Another 21 thumbs down from our party. 

I don't ever expect even good service from Asian restaurants and usually will just suck it up but here is one of my worst experiences. 

Would not go back."}
{"text":"Tsuki izakaya is not located at a great location, it's huge but there is not enough people to fill it up, just because it's in richmond hill and not a lot of people come here for izakayas or are aware that there is even an izakaya here. 

The servers are really quick and friendly, and will help you right away. 
Every time I've went, there's never been more than 2-3 other groups in the entire restaurant, making it uncomfortably quiet.
The waitresses/kitchen staff all attempt to create the atmosphere though, because they yell hello when you come in. 

The food has big portions, and the prices are equivalent to those portions so it's pretty worth it. I've never tried the drinks here, so can't say anything about that.
The setup of the food is quite nice!

It's average, and I can't say more than that."}
{"text":"Tsuki offers solid Izakaya uptown - 3.5 stars. 

There's an impressive menu with tons of traditional Izakaya items to Korean items as well. I am a huge fan of having both Korean and Japanese items on a menu but most Korean sushi joints do not have Izakaya items, so Tsuki is a nice change from the usual. There really is something for everyone.  

Started with the tako wasabi which is was great. Wasabi wasn't too strong, red onions have a nice crunch, and the octopus was tender. 

Also had the pleasure of trying natto for the first time and was disappointed but it was interesting. The Japanese fermented soy beans were serves with pickled vegetables, cucumbers, and a raw quail egg which was all stirred up into a gooey mixture. The taste was unique, with the soy beans primarily coming through. The pickles provided some salt and the raw egg was subtle. Overall, wasn't my cup of tea but I appreciated the dish. 

If you have been reading my reviews, you know I like chirashi and hoe deop bap a lot so I just has to that the Tsuki don here and I wasn't disappointed. It was essentially a chirashi and hoe deop bap hybrid dish without the chogochujang, and added sweet (unagi-like) sauce. I really enjoyed it, although the mayo and sweet sauce was a bit on the heavy side. I also felt they could have given more rice too. It's odd that there's more ingredients than rice in a don (that's a good thing, because every spoonful wasn't just rice like some places). The purple rice was really nice and doesn't detract too much from the don. It works well so why not? 

I also tried some of the cheese buldak and it was great. The chicken was tender and had the right amount of kick. It was sizzling on the hot plate and was enjoyable. Grilled mackerel was also a pleasant surprise, which wasn't fishy at all - something mackerel is known for. 

Service was good and without problems. Food came out way quicker than expected.

Overall, I really enjoyed my short experience here at Tsuki and would gladly come back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"The staff were very accommodating and the food overall was delicious. I especially enjoyed the buttered squid and the takoyaki.  The portions are a bit small though but the quality of the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Food is always good here and reasonably priced. Their spicy salmon salad, teriyaki fries, okonomiyaki, and takoyaki are delicious. Food comes out quite fast too. It's sometimes difficult to flag down the waitress though. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Time to restart the reviews!!  I found myself an izakaya place in Markham!! Since I live in the area, it was always difficult to drive back to mid-town or downtown for some decent izakaya.  I'm glad Tsuki decided to open a second restaurant in Markham!

First thing first, this place is nicely decorated.  I know this used to be a wings place and they kept the television stands, which is perfect if you want to enjoy some izakaya and watch some sports!  Otherwise the use of woods here really impressed me.

The foods here are very decent.  I came here 4 or 5 times already and I would always order these two MUST EAT ITEMS: Butter Squid & Sesame Ice cream.  The butter squid just like its name, has very strong butter taste in it and it was delicious!!  The sesame ice cream i believe is made in house, very strong sesame flavour and if you have been living in Toronto for awhile, you know it's hard to find GOOD sesame ice cream!

Lately, I would like to mention the staff there are super nice and always smiles and they do make the dinner that more enjoyable.

If you are a beer person, go try the Asahi Black which is available in this izakaya if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the long hours. Servers are pretty negligent though. We weren't served tea or water even after we ordered ( I even failed to notice). Instead we witnessed the servers having a heated conversation with the sushi chef and also taking the shots lols. But, it was around 10:30pm so I guess it's fine to wind down.
Love the quality of their sushi, and the fact I can satisfy my cravings close to midnight. Their California don and sashimi salad are also very good; ramen, not so much lol. But I love this place. It's a nice atmosphere for drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"Open late - definitely gave an extra 0.5 star. 

Their sushi is quite unique - purple sushi rice. 
Ordered their seaweed salad with sashimi - decent quality, AYCE sushi grade but still fresh. The rolls however were a little too salty for my liking and one was too spicy. The spicyness overpowered all the fish which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my sister and my niece before Thor 2 (good movie by the way haha).  We ordered a bunch of little plates from the menu and it was delightful.  I was really impressed with the dragon roll.  Every sushi place makes this roll so i am impressed then they did something different or just made it so damn good.  I didn't even need to dip it in any soy sauce (i usually don't anyways) because it was seasoned really well.  All the other plates we also impressive.  

Service was also really good because the seared tuna came out with peanuts and i said \"Don't worry about it i won't eat it\" but they insisted they return it and bring a fresh new plate without...thank you!"}
{"text":"Good place for a large group. Fav dishes were the grilled eel, spicy calamari, and tsuki rolls. Their Korean cheesy chicken was not bad either!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled, having been a regular of Guu for the last 2 years.  Maybe when I saw Izakaya in the name of this establishment, I was expecting a boisterous crowd with communal seating for the true Japanese Izakaya experience.

Or perhaps it was because I have been to this very place when it was known as All-Star Wings for the past few years, and noticed the booth and big screen TVs are exactly the same as it was when it was a wings/sports bar. 

One thing that I must recommend on the menu is the butter squid. Very subtle in a creamy buttery taste, with portions large enough to share amongst 2-3 people while downing a cold Japanese beer.

Butter Squid, Seafood Yaki Udon, Rainbow Roll, Maguro Tataki and sliced raw Beef Tataki were what my gf and I ordered for the evening.  Both Tataki courses were excellent, the slices of tuna and beef were generous and thick, which is a nice change of pace as most izakayas tend to slice these very thin.

The Seafood Yaki Udon did not arrive at our table until 30 minutes after we had finished the tuna and the beef tataki.  We decided to slowly pace out the butter squid as there were only so much we could munch on squid at a time.  I must say the yaki udon left a lot to be desired.   It seemed like the chefs took a whole bottle of teriyaki sauce and just drenched if not poured the entire bottle into the dish.  The watery sauce sank and created a soupy base almost broth like bottom.  It overpowered the entire dish and was very sweet.  The udon noodles were chewy and were not cooked al dente.  There were also a over generous amount of vegetables that did not taste fresh. I suspect they were frozen vegetables as were the squid rings that were in this dish.

Finally, we wanted to add a Rainbow Roll. It was very hard to flag down one of the three waitresses working that evening, no one were checking in on us and after 5-7 minutes of trying to flag someone down, I literally had to get off my seat and talk to one of the waitresses to make our order.  It did not end there however as after the 20 minutes mark, we wanted to cancel the order as it was taking too long and our hunger was subsiding.  When we tried to cancel the course, our waitress said it would be another minute to receive our Rainbow Roll.  

Well, the minute turned into another 7-8 minutes before we received our order.  For one Rainbow Roll, it took an entire 35-40 minutes to receive it at our table.

The tempest did not end there as we found that our Rainbow Roll was soaked in teriyaki sauce, a first for us as out of all the many years of having been to other restaurants that served sushi - we have never, ever seen a Rainbow Roll that was soaked in the sweet, sugary sauce that is teriyaki.  We could barely eat 2 pieces of the roll as we found it overpowering and tasted nothing but too sweet because of the sauce.  We did not even have to use soy sauce.   We packed it to go only throw it out the very next morning as left over sushi should not be consumed the next day.

Some observations:

As the night went on, the restaurant became full with patrons effectively overpowering the wait staff and the kitchen staff. I could only see three waitresses working as well as three chefs working behind the counter.  Service was terrible as the night went on, for ordering 5 dishes we had to stay 2 and a half hours in order to get our complete order. Tea was not refilled promptly and sometime it took 2 or 3 tries to remind the waitresses to top it up. Beer came promptly in the beginning however.

The menu is very big, with a lot of items.  Sushi is offered, which I think adds to the orders being backed up.  Raw oysters are also on the menu.  Tsuki Izakaya sorely needs to hire an additional 2 chefs at least to keep up with orders, perhaps 2 solely working on sushi and the other 3 covering the rest of the menu.  Also, for a weekend, you need to have extra help by hiring more waitresses in covering the entire restaurant.  

I commend the staff that were working that night for keeping up with the demands of the customers for that evening, and hope that they receive extra help soon. 

Our tab came to around $80 with a generous tip on top for the struggling to keep up friendly and courteous waitresses that evening.

We left Tsuki Izakaya, feeling just meh, not impressed but recognizing Tsuki Izakaya has potential if they are able to address their service and lack of staff woes.

For now, Guu shall remain the top notch go to place for us when we need our izakaya fix."}
{"text":"Since I was early for my book club meeting at a near by restaurant and I was starving, I thought I would pop in here and grab a quick, small bite to tide me over.

At first I thought the place was closed b/c it was empty.  EPMTY.  It was 5:45pm and I was the only person in the entire place.  And this is a huge restaurant.  But I was hungry so I decided to throw caution to the wind and just eat here.

I ordered the spicy tuna roll and the octopus salad.  The spicy tuna roll was slightly smaller pieces than other places.  So definitely a quick bite for me.  It was spicy and fresh.  The octopus salad came with strip of seaweed wraps on the side.  I wasn't one hundred percent sure how to eat it, so I did the best I could.  I'm sure the server was laughing at me :).  It had a very acidic taste to it - not necessarily bad, but not my favourite.

The decor is really nice here.  I am curious to see how it is when the restaurant is packed, loud and noisy - like what I think an Izakaya should be like!  It's definitely not the best Izakaya place, but if you live in the area it's decent (assuming it gets cray-cray later in the evenings!  That's part of the fun)!

I think i would come back here to try more options on their menu with a big group."}
{"text":"Tsuki is a solid izakaya restaurant in the area. They have some items that I really like while some are just average. I still come back because its decent izakaya for this area. However, the service is lacking. My group of friends sat down and no waiter came to us to take our orders or serve us tea. We felt abandoned. We had to manually get up to ask for service numerous times. The restaurant was not very busy when we were there but their service is lacking. I hope they improve on this."}
{"text":"I've come here for 2 small birthday dinners and it always impresses me.  Parking is horrible ( not their fault), but if you can get in, be ready for wonderful meal.  

The only thing that keeps me back from giving 5 stars would be service.  It's become a stereotype but bad \"Asian service\" needs to be wiped from our vocabulary."}
{"text":"I decided to come here since there were many reviews here on yelp. The restaurant setting was dim and there were booths, tables and bar area. We ordered a lot of different Korean and Japanese dishes, and sides. My parents favourite was the sashimi salad, which had a mixture of veggies, sashimi and really good salad dressing. My sister really enjoyed the udon which was shared amongst us four. We also ordered this large seafood soup which was spicy and had variety of seafood inside. The sashimi and sushi combo was fresh and they didn't use the typical white rice but this red bean rice(?) The servers at the restaurant were very kind, and nice. Our server remembered all of our orders without writing anything down, which is pretty impressive! Definitely would come again! A very nice selection of food :)"}
{"text":"It's not noisy like most other izakayas. Great ambiance and plenty of big comfy booth seats!
Rolls uses purple rice which to each to their own tastebuds but I enjoyed it and found the rolls to be a good size.
I really enjoyed the buttered squid and takoyaki. Good portions and tasty! Everything came out hot and fresh looking!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family. We heard good reviews about this place from a friend. I was expecting an izakaya similar to Juu but Tsuki was more like a Korean sports bar. 
The service was great but the food could be better. 
The takowasabi wasn't good - there wasn't enough wasabi sauce so it tasted a little bland. The spicy chicken with cheese was too dry and it also lacked flavouring. 
I also thought the menu needs more izakaya selections, so far it leans towards a Korean restaurant rather than a Japanese izakaya."}
{"text":"People, this is an izakaya not a sushi house. Would you go to a steakhouse expecting lasagna? OK, now that THAT's out of the way..... This is not a bad izakaya. Not quite the rambunctious gastropub it's suppose to be, but the menu is decent. Plus it's tasty too and pretty fresh. There's a mix of Korean in there and some sushi rolls which makes the purist in me cringe. Service is friendly and quick. I recommend."}
{"text":"Really good service, the staff was very welcoming and the service was quick. After ordering we received our first dish and many of the following less than 10 minutes after which was on a semi busy Friday night. 

Me and my friends ordered a roll, the seafood pancake which was ($14 I believe) much bigger than expected looking at the menu picture it is enough to share with 4 people or even fill one person if you're ordering only that dish. The sashimi was very fresh and the sauce was just right. The sushi that came was blow torched, and all of the fish tasted very very fresh and refreshing. 

Atmosphere of the place was very welcoming. You go in and there is a sushi bar, and to the open area there are many tables for bigger groups to sit. Many decorations of sake on the shelves that make the place authentic Japanese and there is very dim lighting - that's why the photos are so dark."}
{"text":"Tried the new location with a couple friends and was pleasantly surprised! It's hard to come by a good izakaya in the Markham/Richmond Hill area. Parking spaces a little limited as there are many other dining restaurants in the plaza. 

Ordered the Mikazuki Sashimi Sushi Combo to try. The sashimi was served one a bed of ice and was fresh, almost melting in your mouth - definitely recommend! Delicately arranged, the platter was beautiful. Also tried the Maguro Tataki which was light and refreshing. I recommend the Sashimi Salad and Seafood Pancake as well. The Teriyaki Poutine was interesting, but a little too sweet for my liking. 

The service was a little slow, but quiet and great for conversation. The servers are polite and attentive and offered recommendations. Pricing is on par with other izakayas.

5 stars, will definitely return for special occasions or just to treat myself."}
{"text":"Good food,  decent servings.  Very friendly servers.  My girlfriend and I came here for a late lunch.  We ordered the spider rolls -  soooo good.  And I also had the spicy pork bento .  Hot sake hits the spot.  We stayed there for a good 3.5 hours.  This is what happens when you mix alcohol with good company. They were very patient with us,  and didn't in any way give an indication that we overstayed.  They also close late,  so if you have late night cravings for Japanese food,  this is the place to be.  One more thing,  the grilled squid and takoyaki balls are so delish"}
{"text":"Very cozy environment. Friendly staff. Awesome and consistent food. Usually easy to find parking. As a picky eater, this is my go to spot for good tasty comfort izakaya."}
{"text":"Food was not fresh, bathrooms filthy, mouldy smell in the restaurant, poor service, very poor food. We ordered seared tuna which is supposed to be raw in the centre, the entire set was light brown as it was old with a very unpleasant texture. Soggy and sometimes sour sashimi bowl, soggy karaage, kimchi pork was ~60% fat with dry meat, sushi rice very unpleasant. Fish across the board was unfresh with very off-putting texture. It was a blow to leave food unfinished and be hit with a $95 bill for two, following with mild stomach aches.

Hate to write negative reviews, but this was negligent across the board, and I hope this will act as an encouragement to the owners to do better and to take food freshness more seriously...all the best."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Friday night (that is busy for the parking lots). Service was prompt and attentive. The food was alright, comlarable to other izakayas. We ordered the beef tataki which was lacking in flavour and quite small in portion size. The rolls are made with purple rice and was good but pricey in terms of size. Overall worth a try but nothing special."}
{"text":"I came here 2 weeks ago with a friend and I was skeptical about the quality of the food.  The outside of the restaurant didn't look too appealing, and I knew the prices would be slightly higher than average.  I am glad my friend suggested this place to me though. We had a medium sushi platter between the two of us. The fish here was extremely fresh and fatty.  The fish felt like they melted in my mouth.  This place uses purple rice which essentially tastes the same, but it's nice to try something new. We ended up ordering the grilled BBQ chicken as well after we finished the platter because we were still hungry.  I was surprised that the chicken left me wanting more after my first bite!  The sauce was sweet, savory and also had a little kick of heat to it.  Overall the food was excellent and I've been wanting to go back ever since.

Now to go over the service here.  Our server was very friendly and quickly brought us water before we even asked.  While we were looking at our menu they came and gave us a few suggestions.  During the dinner, they brought us everything we asked for and was very attentive to our needs (ie. refill water/tea).  I will definitely come back here in the future with more friends."}
{"text":"My fave spot close to home. Service and food is consistently good. It's a great place to hang without the loudness of yelling overbearing customers trying to talk over one another like most of the other izakayas. My fave dish is the steak tofu and fried squid!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with fresh fish, open very late and isn't crowded most of the time. Somewhat expensive but considering quality I wouldn't say so. Don't use a lot of soy sauce since it's very salty."}
{"text":"Straight up, It wasn't a memorable experience here. 

I felt that there was a lack of bento box or combo items and if you wanted to get everything in a bento box separately, you would empty your wallet that night.

Wasn't too busy on a friday afternoon, picked up a little during the evening and service wasn't too bad, though I don't think pouring ice water that previously contained hot tea is good service.

I got an avocado roll and the Aspara cheese. The sushi rice was coloured slightly pink, which was really pretty and the avocado was perfectly ripe. I really enjoyed the sushi here but the Aspara cheese wasn't anything to rave about. Few gratings of mozzarella cheese melted over sauteed unseasoned mushrooms and asparagus bits for 10 dollars! Big whoop.

Their decision to play some weird Japanese punk rock/pop music while featuring wrestling on their TVs was not a good combination and I found the music to be too loud at times. Probably be back to try their green dragon roll and teriyaki poutine when in the east beaver creek area.........til then!"}
{"text":"My Orders: Creamy Croquette (nom), Chicken Buldaki (eh, ok), Tonkotsu Ramen (nom), Deep Fried Tofu (eh), Makkoli + Sprite (mmm).

Pros
+ Ambiance 
+ Service 
+ Food 
+ Parking 

Cons
- Price 
- Location: hard to find, hidden behind 3 brewers. 

I'd come back. I'm surprised I didn't find out about this place sooner. It's a great place to get little bites and share among friends."}
{"text":"Hands down my FAVORITE Izakaya in Toronto and the GTA.

There used to be one on Yonge St in North York, but it got dozed for a condo... Hope they can relocate back!!!

We always go for the fish dishes and their salmon collar is something to drool over!
The grilled, buttered squid is exceptional but what's truly special is the Wara Yaki: Salmon or Tuna sashimi smoked over burning hay served alongside thinly sliced garlic and onions and fresh sea salt!"}
{"text":"For an uptown Izakaya, Tsuki is not bad at all! I've been here five times now, over the course of about a year, and the quality of the food has always been consistently good. The service is good and the servers are nice, though if you are seated in the back during a quieter day, it may take a little more effort to flag down a server. The location is a little bit troublesome, since it's kind of hidden away behind other restaurants and doesn't have its own parking but it's not so bad that it would deter me from visiting.

They serve Korean dishes as well as typical Japanese Izakaya eats, but in my opinion the Japanese dishes outshine the Korean ones by far. The sashimi is fresh, beautifully prepared and they have a large variety to choose from. The rolls are also a good choice, and made with purple rice. My favourite roll is the Spider Roll!

On my latest visit, we were celebrating a birthday and asked if they would order a cake for us. The manager happily secured a delicious cake for us from another establishment and kept it a surprise as well!

Must Try: Sashimi Salad, Beef Tataki, Okonomi Yaki, Buttered Squid

Only Okay: Oden Nabe, Tako Yaki

Unique Features: Purple Rice"}
{"text":"I was really surprised about this place. Came here with no expectations. There was one waitress and one waiter during lunch on a Friday. The waitress was running up and down the place and working really hard. She had forgot our tea's but I could not stay mad at her. She was really cute and working so hard :)

Meal came with a complementary noodle soup which was very tasty. 
As an appetizer started off with deep fried oysters. Done very well with light breading on the outside. The oysters were really fresh and tasty and fairly large in size. It came with a side of coleslaw with wasabi dressing and also a side of salad for $7.

For the main I went with the salmon teriyaki bento box for $9. For this price I was not expecting much but everything was above expectations when I compared them to other Japanese restaurants. Loved how the steamed veggies were in a cute bamboo container like at dim sum places. There was a side salad, two pieces of tofu, two pieces of avocado sushi, purple rice and a fairly good size salmon. It was the most healthy meal I have eaten in a while. The salmon was nice and moist and the presentation of the whole dish was just perfect. 

Also got the fried seafood udon noodle for $10.99 - Another great dish with amazing flavours and had a good amount of seafood which included, shrimps, calamari rings and oysters. 

Didn't get to try any of the sushi/sashimi to see how fresh it was but I can't wait to come back to give it a try."}
{"text":"Quite surprised by the quality of food here.  It was top notch and everything was tasty.  We tried a few rolls, different apps and everything was worth it.  The only thing I thought was not worth the price for the app was the miso black cod, came out very small and not worth the price.  After 10pm a pitcher of Sapporo was $11 which is an amazing deal.  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Definitely glad I don't have to trek down to Tsuki North York anymore, since Tsuki Richmond Hill is now open. Quite frankly I'm surprised why this place isn't busier, because it should be.

Their sushi & sashimi isn't the norm; as they offer pretty good value and the fish is pretty fresh and so good. It is worth every penny, it is interesting to note that their maki is made with purple rice; which is a bit unusual. 

Service is pretty friendly and the menu is pretty much the same as North York - but a bigger more pleasant space.

Their grilled butter squid was pretty good, tender without being too chewy. 

Takoyaki - ok - but not too stand out compared to the sushi/sashimi. 

BC tuna tataki - I normally would be all over this dish; but I think this dish while beautifully done, just pales in comparison to the straight-up sashimi. ( that is just how wonderful their sashimi is)

Tofu steak - not really vegetarian as it has minced pork over the top of the tofu and watch out for that first bite if you get it right when it arrives fresh out of the kitchen - it is really hot as the tofu is pretty much fresh out of the fryer. 

Service - friendly and they check on you just enough to make you feel pretty good. Surprised us with a complementary dish - buttered shrimp, asparagus and mushroom dish - it was pretty good too. 

Extra bonus - open late 2am on weeknights. Check with the staff first as to what sakes are available as they might not have some that are listed on the drinks menu."}
{"text":"Good service. Food came to the table quickly. Complimentary little noodle soup to start. We then had the tuna tataki, butter yaki and the spicy roll. The butter yaki was so good we thought about getting a second order. It rarely has a lineup and is comfortably full.

The day after: in hindsight the spicy roll combo we shared had way too much siracha mayo on top. Upset tummy last night."}
{"text":"I accept the fact it's not an authentic Izakaya cuisine, but it's still easily one of the best sushi places I've had given the price. If I had more people tonight I would've definitely tried out some of the appetizers.

Our table of 3 had the Mikazuki sashimi combo, Mikazuki sushi combo, spicy salmon roll, california roll, and a takoyaki. All the sushi/roll related items were simply excellent in terms of taste and presentation, and the usage of brown rice was rather unique. Plus, brown rice is healthier for you; a plus!

If there was a disappointing part of our meal it would be the takoyaki. It wasn't bad, but the pieces were a bit small and it didn't have the taste that I enjoyed in, say, Kenzo. Not bad though for 7 pieces/$7.

Service was excellent, run by pretty young Asian girls. I'll definitely come back to try some of the fried and appetizer items."}
{"text":"I was looking for something new to try and came across this restaurant.

The place was very ornate, and very clean.

There is a strong smell of wood in the place, but I got used to it pretty quickly.

I had miso soup as well as red tuna and salmon sashimi and a red tuna hand roll.  I have never been served a hand roll with so much red tuna in it anywhere.

The red tuna was the best part.  

The fish was very fresh and served at a proper temperature.   The soup was very good and a good sized portion.

We did not see an all you could eat option, but the food was of a very high calibre.  This was a very good experience.

Recommended highly."}
{"text":"I've always liked Tsuki even when it was located at Yonge/Finch area. The owner is apparently still the same and the food seems very similar to before. However, I don't remember the sushi pieces being so tiny. They were literally the size of my thumb. I found that the their prices were a bit high for what you get, particularly for the sushi-related items.

The grilled butter squid, ebi mayo, and sashimi salad were also very tasty as usual. We shared 4-5 dishes among two of us, which was enough, but we saved room for bubble tea afterwards!

It's a great addition to the East Beaver Creek restaurant area. The atmosphere is a lot brighter than the previous location and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Came to this place for a drink...pretty small place, use to be a wings place
Pitcher of Sapporo was $17 bucks

Place kind of smelled funny like a toilet
We didn't bother ordering anything else"}
{"text":"This Izakaya is mediocre when compared to the likes of Kinka and Zakkushi. The atmosphere misses the spot. Upon entering, there is not the usual loud warm welcome from the staff, but instead you see numerous plasma screens in all corners of the restaurant. The overall feel is more like a sports bar than an izakaya, per se. 

The quality of the food does not hit the price point. We got the Hangetsu sashimi combo, the grilled salmon collar, the grilled squid, and the spicy pork. 

The hangetsu combo came with a limited selection of fish. It was all you can eat quality for the most part and had all the usual suspects of salmon, tuna, mackerel, butterfish and snapper. They did have hamachi, but the quality was not fresh and the taste was off and a bit fishy. 

The salmon collar and grilled squid were decent. In particular, the salmon was on special so we got it for a steal at 5$. The squid was also nicely grilled. 

The spicy pork was too saucy and tasted like it had been marinated for a month. The pieces were also not cut to bite-size portions. 

All in all, the menu has some decent grilled items, as should be the norm for all izakayas, but the sushi/sashimi options on the menu should be passed on. It's not a bad place for drinks and late night food while watching sports, but there are better dinner options around for the same price level."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is, but there's a smell to this place. I also need to point out the flooring in this restaurant are not wood but in fact laminates and is pretty dangerous if its wet and you are wearing shoes. I was in casual shoes and I didn't realize how slippery the floor was and I almost slipped. I thought it was just my shoes because casual shoes can be slippery, but I saw others in heels, leather shoes and sandals having the same problems. Two fully grown men in suits almost slipped on their way to the washroom. They were literally grabbing onto fixtures to keep themselves from falling. They were clearly not drunk as they came in after us and only ordered 2 bento boxes. So just be careful if you are visiting this restaurant when its raining or snowing outside. 

The food here is alright, nothing was particularly memorable and although this place is close to home it's not a place I would frequent. 

It's probably a personal taste but I find their spicy salmon rolls aren't spicy enough. The shari also isn't sour enough. Their lunch specials are good for its price but they aren't opened on weekends for lunch. Their sushi/sashimi are fresh and well prepared and its probably the only thing that's saving this place from receiving a 2 star rating. They also have a good selection of alcohol."}
{"text":"This cute little izakaya has been around for quite a while but I never gave it a chance as I assumed it was still a dingy place run by Chinese people like the prior wings place, lol.

When I walked in, I was surprised to see a cute bar-type style setting with many snug booth seats. 

We ordered Tsuki roll, cheese buldak and spicy salmon roll as a small dinner and it came out to around $50 for two people. One thing that I love is that they use purple rice for everything.

The service here is great, tea and water refills throughout our meal and the staff are very friendly.

Overall, I'm not sure I would come here often as if I were actually hungry..it would be very pricey to fill me up! Additionally, the ventilation here isn't that great..everything from my hair to my clothing smelled of deep fried/oil/etc! yuck

P.S. They have late night beer specials!"}
{"text":"3.5*  Sorta difficult to rate this one as well 'cause the only other Izakaya that I've been to was Guu and my experiences varied so greatly.    

Guu - dinner service, weekend, super duper busy, LOUD, & downtown.  Menu was more of a fusion, tapas style with a variety of cocktails.

Tsuki - lunch, weekday, only 1 other diner in the restaurant aside from my table of 2, and uptown.  Menu was more traditional of a Korean/Japanese a la carte restaurant with a bonus cocktail menu.

What I liked:  Complimentary soup, additional steamed veg with special sauce that came alongside a sushi/sashimi bento, makis came with purple rice which didn't feel as filling as the reg, white sushi rice, and obviously presentation.  Spicy Salmon was good, but sauce comes on top of roll.

I felt as though the sushi looked much better than it tasted.  Taste was good too, but it just looked waaay better.  Some sashimi pieces were slightly on the fishy side.

Lunch for 2 with 1 cocktail was just over $50, excluding tips, with a few leftover makis.

Certainly not opposed to coming back!"}
{"text":"Our server was extremely friendly and loved to smile. She checked up on us frequently, as well as the ones bussing our dishes.
We ordered the recommendations of the server. I split an appetizer and three entrees among three people. For the price, the portions could be larger. However, it is great for groups to taste different dishes.  I was full, but my brother and sister-in-law said they were still hungry. I do recommend their Okonomiyaki and Spicy Pork were delicious. I am not experienced enough to say that it was the best in town, but you would not regret ordering the okonomiyaki."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to eat and drink.  I've been here twice and the food is definitely different.  Their fish selection was the usual basic salmon, tuna, mackerel, butter fish, ...  If you are looking for the other \"richer\" fish (e.g. Toro) they don't have that.  An no selection for robatayaki style foods just yakitori (is the only robatayaki food item).  

Their hot pot is really good! 

I went once during Christmas day for dinner.  And I was so glad they were open!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place!  It's very children friendly - waitstaff is attentive bringing extra bowls and cutlery for the boys and even engaged in discussion with them beyond \"hi\".  Recommendations were good.

We had beef tataki - super good but small ($17), small sushi combo ($22 I think?) udon ($9) small-medium but kids gobbled it up, teriyaki poutine was delicious ($5), gyu tongue ($9) was ok, butter squid was very good and well prepared ($9 i think?), had the green tea mochi for dessert which were pretty good but i kinda wish they had more variety of desserts :P

The music they played when we first got there was awesome: r&b from the early 2000s lol

Would definitely go here again but it's a bit pricey compared to the cheap alternatives nearby...you pay for what you get tho :P

I'd love to try the Sapporo polar beer next time!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum! I loved this place. I'm glad Vlad and I made the trek here. I tried some things I would normally never try such as some goopy beans and raw octapus (not my fave), and some crunchy deep fried pasta which was really good with beer! I also tried sake for the first time, which I quite enjoyed.
My boyfriend and I split the Mikazuki sushi/sashimi combo which was $23, a pretty good deal!
It was delicious. The scallops were really good and I even liked the squid which I normally never like.
I was impressed it was open until 2 am.
I really liked the food and I would make the trip to Richmond Hill to go again!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends on a Friday evening. Service was great! Awesome, friendly, and attentive even though we had a pretty big group of 16. We got a bunch of dishes: 
Okonomiyaki - got to try a bit of it - decent portion - would get again
Tonkotsu ramen - pretty average - nice light broth and the pork was tender with the right amount of seasoning 
Large sushi platter - this was the eye catcher because of the purple rice used instead of the usual white rice - Korean fusion? - there's a good mix of different sushi here but in terms of taste I'd say it's average. 
Spicy sashimi bowl - nice amount of sashimi with nice presentation 
Chicken dalbuk - lacks in size but makes up for it in flavour
The Tsuki Roll was pretty good as well
I'll definitely come back to try other items as it's decently priced."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner awhile back and their izakaya didn't stand out but came back for lunch with colleagues today and wow they're lunch bentos were delicious! I wish I remembered to take photos.

The quality and presentation of my chicken bento box overruled my annoyance of having waited 40 minutes for our miso soup, salad and lunch bentos. Was the meal worth the 40 minute wait? No, but overall I was very pleased with their lunch set. All bentos offer a choice of steamed vegetables or tempura. My bento had chicken terayaki, a dumpling, two pieces of cali roll, salad, rice (they use purple rice). I liked that they used a yuzu sauce for their salad, rather than the usual japanese salad dressing. Chicken was a little overcooked but everything else was fresh and tasty. Everyone enjoyed their bentos of salmon, kalbi, beef, and rolls (spicy salmon and cali). One friend ordered the sashimi rice but I would recommend the bento as it offers a wider variety of food and portion is larger. 

Because Tsuki opens at 11:45 on weekdays, I think the kitchen took some time to warm up hence the long wait. I'd definitely come back for their lunch though. The staff also recommended calling in to pre-order the food in order to avoid long waits, if you are tight on time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an Izakaya uptown, Tsuki Izakaya is a pretty good contender among all the options uptown!

The interior of the restaurant sports a wooden theme that feels cozy and looks great. Service was ok, the staff was friendly but don't expect the atmosphere to be like an Izakaya downtown.

Food wise, the quality was pretty consistent with their selection of cooked and raw food items. 

Tako Wasabi - Octopus was fresh and not slimy. The level of spice seemed higher than other locations which I liked and did not smell fishy at all.

Maguro Tataki - This was OK. Lightly seared tuna with a light soy sauce and peanuts on top. 

Sashimi Salad - A mix of fresh sashimi in a salad. The house salad dressing is a nutty, soy sauce dressing? Not sure but it was good!

Butter Squid - Amazing! Was nicely presented on the plate and the butter kept the squid moist and added enough saltiness. Comes with a mayo sauce as well but it has more than enough flavour. Highly recommended

Seafood Pancake - This was huge! Also a really good dish, it was chewy and a great mix of seafood and flavour. Only consider ordering if you have more than two people

Sushi, Sashimi & Maki Platter - a great assortment of fresh fish and California rolls. They use purple rice for all their sushi and maki rolls and is an interesting twist!

Tsuki Don - A mix between a Chirashi and California Don. An assortment of sashimi and the ingredients of a California roll over a bed of purple rice. Also recommended!

I would definitely go back and for four people the bill came to $100 which was not bad at all. For those who don't want to go downtown for an Izakaya, Tsuki is a pretty good choice."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about my experience here. I would have it at 3.5. 

Parking was horrendous, especially during peak dinner times and late hours. 
You can find this restaurant tucked in the corner of the plaza. 

We made the mistake of ordering one of the party trays. I really didn't understand why they gave them out with the other menus when we were clearly there for sit down? However, they still made the maki tray for us, which was kind of them. 

The small Maki tray included: Avocado+cucumber roll, Dynamite roll, California roll, Spice salmon roll & Snow Dragon roll (which is a MUST TRY!) 
Don't be surprised when the rice looks purple!! 

We also ordered:
- Calamari, which was NOT worth it as the pieces were incredibly thin and battered inconsistently. 
- Tako Yaki (octopus balls), which I was super excited for. Not the BEST that I've tasted and were a too small... but still enjoyed it! 

I also found it a tad too expensive for my liking."}
{"text":"3 stars if i was coming for the sushi, but 4 stars if I was coming for their other dishes (ie. the yakiudon, bibimbap, appetizers etc)

I agree with other yelpers that it's not authentic japanese sushi since they use purple rice, however, it is run  by koreans, and they tend to use that kind of rice. 

Also, the sashimi, is definitely not the highest of quality depending on your visit. but it's mainly just OK and sometimes GOOD. 

However, their korean dishes and anything besides sushi and sashimi are very very good. So, I would recommend to steer clear of the sushi items and order some hot food items and appetizers.

Service is always polite and attentive."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and probably my last. 

Let's start with the positives, good location, nice decor and lots of food selections (jap and Korean dishes). The price is fair and the service is good, our tea cup were always filled.  

Now on to the reason why I give it 2 stars, the food quality.  The charashi don we ordered wasn't the freshest, in fact, a couple of pieces tasted quite fishy (punt fully intended) and funny.  Our red dragon roll were a bit soggy although we quite like the purple rice as oppose to the typical white sushi rice. The age tofu was just mediocre. Worst of all, I had a stomachache after lunch which resulted in multiple trips to the bathroom after."}
{"text":"I've been recently visiting this place more often because they're open late, and they ALWAYS fulfill my sushi cravings late at night!

The service here is phenomenal, late at night there's usually only one waitress serving the place, but she always does a great job, very pleasant.

The sashimi is always fresh, and they're flexible when it comes to substitutions because I mainly like to eat Salmon more than any other fish.

The seatings in this place are very comfortable, not too loud, and lots of room.  Recently found out that this restaurant has taken a part of the Lexus Platinum members group so you can get 10% off if you have the discount card from Lexus! They also have $10.99 pitchers of Sapporo or $4.99 for a pint after 10PM as their special.

I will always be coming here from now on whenever I'm craving for sushi late at night!"}
{"text":"My quest to finding the best Izakaya place in GTA continues.  It's going to be difficult to find a place that will top Kinka, Nome, Kintaro, Ju or Kingyo.  Tsuki definitely has a good selection of Izakaya dishes and everything was okay but there wasn't really one dish that stood out.  However, it's closest to home and prices were reasonable so I'll probably be back.

We ordered a variety of izakaya dishes for sharing:

1) Sashimi salad - good portion and a very nice mix of raw fish and tasty dressing.

2) Oden - really like having this dish in the winter.  Fish cakes, radish in a hot soy-flavored dashi broth.  This was very yummy.  It was just missing the Karashi (Japanese mustard) for dipping.  Nome serves it perfectly.

3) Karaage (fried chicken) - this was tasty but the pieces where not as juicy as the way Kinka makes it.

4) Sashimi platter - this was okay but nothing special.  Will probably skip ordering this next time and stick with the cook food.

5) Grilled squid - best dish!  Perfectly grilled and seasoned.

6) Takoyaki (octopus balls) - it was served with the  right sauce and seasoning on top but the wheat flour-based batter was only okay.  Gal's sushi actually makes the best takoyaki.

Overall, the atmosphere was very nice and we did enjoy the food.  We'll definitely be back if we feel like izakaya."}
{"text":"UPDATE (02/07/15):

So I decided to come again a second time to try more from their menu, but I ended up super disappointed. I noticed that there was different staff who weren't as nice and friendly as the waitresses from the first visit but that's not the main issue.

The food. Ok. So I'm pretty sure that the chefs today were not the chefs from my first visit. I loved the beef tataki from before so I ordered it again this time, only to find little bits of meat poorly arranged on a plate. 

The beef tataki from the first visit was wonderful and full of beef flavour and also \"normal\" sized. The beef tataki from today was HALF the size of the beef tataki from before, no joke. The taste was not terrible but wasn't as good as the first time. We were very disappointed with it.

We also ordered their spicy salmon roll and crunch roll. They were good rolls but not anything amazingly delicious. I even tried their butter squid that many people recommended, it was ok but I personally think that Hibiki makes it better. 

One little warning: DO NOT ORDER THE BC TUNA! We ordered the BC tuna in the beginning with the rest of our food and we ate everything that came, and we even called for the bill when we finished. 

What we didn't notice was that we didn't even get the BC tuna! We didn't notice until my mom looked over the receipt and we asked the waitress who told us that the chefs were still making it. So it takes an hour to make it? Ok, even if it is supposed to take that long it would've been much appreciated if we were warned about this when ordering. 
We wanted to cancel the order but sadly, the waitress said that it was already being made so we couldn't cancel. She said it would be ready in a few minutes so we asked for it to be put into a take out box. 
After 10 minutes of waiting, the waitress handed us the box and we rushed out of the restaurant. In the car we decided to see the fancy tuna that we had to wait an hour for, and we ended up with 5 small pieces of overcooked tuna in a giant take out box. Really, we waited an hour for this. So yea, disappointment. 
 
TL;DR:

Overall, I feel that this is a great restaurant to eat at but a major problem is that they are not consistent with their food. One day it can taste amazing, but if you come back another day, it could taste horrible. I was very dissapointed today, but I will not give up on this restaurant! I shall come back again next time (for the purple sushi)!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't that busy on a Saturday night. I went with a few friends without making a reservation at around 7:45pm. We ordered seafood pancake ($13), bulgogi ($14), Tsuki Don ($13), buttered squid ($9) and Yaki Soba ($10).

- Seafood pancake: kind of dry and tasteless without the sauce, so I guess it's OK to eat with the sauce, but I personally don't really like this dish

- Bulgogi: the beef was very tough...maybe it's just tonight, but still...we were very disappointed in this dish.

- Tsuki Don: this was not bad, but definitely not authentic. As some people have already mentioned, they served us purple rice. I wish there were more fishes in the bowl..

- Butter squid: this is the best dish we ordered out of the 5. Squid is very buttery.

- Yaki Soba: just stir fried noodle. nothing special about this dish.

- Service: excellent

Overall, I think I will still go back, but will definitely order something different. I may try out their small dishes like tako wasabi, karaage, Teriyaki Poutine.."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday (new year's eve) and surprisingly they weren't packed (The Keg told me it would be a 2 hour wait).

Between my boyfriend and I, we got the okonomi yaki,   cheese buldak, tonkotsu ramen with extra noodles, maguro tataki, snow dragon roll, and Byakko 'white tiger' roll. 

Really enjoyed the ramen! Yummy broth with al dente noodles. The broth looks very creamy and rich but has just the right amount of flavor. Everything was delicious! Not sure if I was just getting full by the time the white tiger roll came along but I thought it of all the things we ordered, that roll was just okay. Not bad but wouldn't recommend in particular. 
The only downside of the entire experience was that both my boyfriend and I felt queasy about an hour after our dinner. I'm not jumping to any conclusions that it was due to their food but we had not eaten anything else hours beforehand so...*shrug* 
It did make us raise our eyebrows that our maguro tataki came after our okonomi yaki and our tonkotsu ramen but we just assumed they had to defrost it??? 

Overall, it was a good experience. Would come back for the ramen. Fairly priced items with good portions."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunches for a few times and I love that they use purple rice in all their rice dishes.

Their service during lunch is usually pretty good and not too slow. However their portion recently has gotten smaller."}
{"text":"My friends and I like to come here for drinks as after 10pm they do specials on Sapporo pitchers. I believe it's $10.99/pitcher. The food is pretty good for a late night place. We had 1.8litre bottles of sake at $130/bottle which I thought was decent. I came here for dinner once or twice and ordered the 300ml bottles of sake and it ended up being like $70/person (which I thought was pretty pricey). We were the last table here that night and we ordered a lot of alcohol, the owner sent us several dishes on the house which I thought was pretty nice. Worth to come for late night drinking and snacks"}
{"text":"Pretty good for an uptown izakaya. I came here thinking it would be a typical Japanese izakaya but it is actually more of a fusion Japanese/Korean restaurant. A fair share of their menu is Korean dishes. Overall the food and ambiance were enjoyable. 

Nagasaki chanpon - this was my favourite as the spicy broth was surprisingly flavourful and the udon noodles were a good texture. The amount of seafood was generous, although it is a bit pricey after you add the $2 for the udon.

Salmon Wara Yaki - this was a little disappointing as the salmon didn't taste very fresh. The smoky flavour was good though.

Cheese Buldak - this hot bbq chicken had just the perfect amount of melted cheese on it. I really liked the flavour of this dish but some people may find it not spicy enough compared to regular Korean food levels

Buttered Squid - good buttery taste but has the same problem typical to most grilled squid dishes - gets cold too quickly"}
{"text":"I am excited!

I love Izakaya Tsuki's North York location  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/izakaya-tsuki-toronto and I am glad that they decided to open up another location up in Richmond Hill!

Opens till 2 am 7 days a week  as I always have midnight snack/drinks attack and kind of bored going to my usual Cheap Chinese places or one of the franchise restaurants/lounges.

The staff here are friendly, attentive and polite. I would leave that to my Yelp friend to comment on that as I was busy drinking my sake and trying to take some photos of my food.

We shared:

Ankimo - Steamed Monk Fish Liver ($9)
- Since I cannot eat foie gras all the time in Toronto, I would settle for monk fish liver
-  Texture was smooth and just with a little fishiness

Maguro Tataki ($14)
- Not the best maguro but a dish with interesting texture and taste
- Love the mixed greens on the side, I need my veggie sometimes!

Buta Negi Shio Yaki - Grilled Pork with Mustard Mayo ($10)

Okunomatsu Kinmon ($22.99)
- Not every sake is available on the menu and there are definitely a good choice of quite a few sakes

I know I will be back to Izakaya Tsuki to have a draft beers or 2 when I am looking for a late night spot to chill out a little."}
{"text":"Been going here since summer, i am so glad i have discovered this jem! This joint beats any other sushi spot, even though its an izakaya. The menu is extensive. My faves are obviously tsuki don(a must try!) which no other place has, grilled squid that is cooked to perfection which is also rare nowadays, sashimi salad is to die for, and tamaguro roll with red tuna, tomatoes and garlic sauce. I mean everything else that Iv tried here is also delicious. Their lunch boxes are of a great value.The place has great ambience and music, service is always very consistent. This place is good for a quick lunch, big party or nice dinner. Its simply a spot to-go-to! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This review is for a lunch experience.  Food 4 stars. Overall value 4.5 stars.

This must be the best kept secret for lunch at Hwy 404 and Hwy 7 area.

I came for a Friday lunch.  The 3 items (a rice, a Japanese stir fry noodle and a sushi/sashimi bento box) that we ordered were unreasonably cheap as per the quality.  For reference, I would place the food quality of the lunch food here be a notch below Hibiki lunch, and a notch above Mi-Ne (Woodbine) lunch.  But Tsuki's lunch is cheaper than both!
 
Tsuki Don $12 - my favourite of this meal.  Purple rice with Teriyaki sauce, raw sashimi bites, fish roes, black sesame, seaweed and mayo.  Very delicious, very sweet, very fresh.  I don't regret the calories.  This one can give Hibiki a run for its money.

Sushi/Sashimi Bento Box $13 - second favourite of the meal.  Sashimi was very fresh and sufficiently creamy.  Quality was below Hibiki yet on par, in my opinion, with Inatei lunch sashimi. Craftsmanship could be better as some slices were thicker, and some were thinner. Sushi were smaller pieces, meaning they were of traditional sizes.  The fish slices on top of the rice were too thin.  No wasabi in between.  Other items in the box were tempura (good variety, meh quality), maki roll (good quality), and salad (no comment; didn't eat).  Portion was generous for the price.

Yaki Soba $10 - I am not a fan of this one, because it was oily.  Further, the noodle used was thin ramen not soba.  Aside from these, it was an okay dish.  The ramen was of good quality, and it tasted alright.  Not too salty.  The portion was generous for the price.  

Place was quiet at Friday lunch hour.  We got seated promptly.  Server was friendly and, as Chris C stated, she was the only one running the show on floor.  Background music was loud.

I already plan to return for another lunch, and maybe try their grilled food."}
{"text":"This is the third time we had eaten in Tsuki. Overall, we are not impressed by our experience there. 

Complimentary soup with noodles - Saying no to free food will lead to bad karma. As a superstitious gourmandise, I embraced the complimentary appetizer with open arms! The soup was well seasoned. 

Spicy Mayo Ebi ($4.50 for 3) - When fried food is coated with a sauce in advanced, the crispiness is often compromised. This was true for the spicy mayo ebi. 

Hangetsu ($35.00 for 21pc sashimi, 18pc sushi and maki) - Mediocre was unfortunately, the word that came to mind. The sashimi was not as fresh as it used to be. Personally, I discriminate against pseudo \"purple rice\" - white sushi rice disguised as purple rice with the additional of a minuscule amount of purple rice. The rice is tinted to give it a seemingly \"healthy\" appearance. 

Dolsot Bibimbap with Bulgogi ($9.99) - The bibimbap was slightly below the average Korean restaurant. The adjacent colours of the vegetables did appeal to my senses; however, it was missing the smoky sesame oil flavor. 

Kaki Fry ($8.00) - The deep fried oyster was crisp, yet it lacked the juiciness of typical fried oysters. When served with Japanese tartar, the dryness of the oyster was compensated somewhat."}
{"text":"Nice selection of appetizers. Sashimi tasted fresh. Sushi is just okay, not a big fan of the purple rice as it was falling apart"}
{"text":"First off, keep in mind this is not an authentic 'izakaya'. If you are expecting the quality similar to Guu or Ju or any place operated by Japanese, you will be disappointed. (I know its hard to tell when its says 'izakaya' and the menu is somewhat similar to other places...) Any Japanese can tell this by how they make the broth, or sauces, ingredients, pairing of condiments etc. They lacked in knowledge of real japanese izakaya food. 

I would call this place a Korean restaurant that serves mediocre so-called Japanese food.

But thumbs up for being 
opened until 2 am!"}
{"text":"I was not too impressed with the food. Granted, we did not order any sushi. The bibimbap was very dry and tasteless while the seafood udon was nothing special. 

The restaurant was very dimly lit. Although dim, the light bulbs were almost eye level which made it very unpleasant. They casted a lot of shadows on the menu, making them difficult to read."}
{"text":"I have been here three times on Fri and Sun. This place is so cool! Asian vibe, good service and delicious dishes. The waitress always served big smile and nice attitude even though it was a busy day. About the dishes, i really recommend 'Buttered squid' and 'Tsuki roll'. They said these are signature menu. you wanna visit here again? Of course I do!!"}
{"text":"I love this  place. i went there for my birthday with a party of 10. All the items on the menu were delicious. My favorite dishes were beef tataki ,  Sashimi and the skewers.The portions were generous and not skimpy. Unlike some Izakaya where it feels like you are eating at a French restaurant and and you go in and out with an empty stomach. 

The Service was great, nothing to complain about. I'm surprised that the food arrived promptly after our orders were submitted."}
{"text":"The menu selection was small compared to the downtown izakayas. A mix of Japanese and Korean dishes to choose from. The presentation was really nice and the purple rice was a unique touch. The service was slow but it's a good quiet place to have some drinks and share a few appetizers with friends. Didn't order many dishes but was really full at the end, probably because of the wait time in between each dish.

Overall, a good place to have some appetizers and spend some quiet time with a date."}
