{"text":"Amazing chicken fingers!!! Bartender Ted will hook it up!! Go here ranch is worth it."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service. The fried cheese curds are a must and we ordered it with marinara sauce. They were delicious and were nothing like I can find in Vegas. Rated them a 5 for these two things alone.   We also ordered the chicken fingers with homemade chips and the chicken quesadilla. Note that the portions are huge. You will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch. Heidi is the best waitress with great suggestions and wonderful personality. Food is homemade."}
{"text":"My first time here. My friend had been coming here every week back in 2008, loving their chicken fingers. She decided we should check it out. Chicken fingers were as good as ever...will be back. We ordered cheese curds...very yummy! Saw reviews about bad service but found that our server, Heidi was great. Friendly and efficient. Bloody Mary's were great. I ordered regular...good heat. My friend ordered, \"spicy\"...she said it was delicious. Definitely will be back for more...chicken fingers. : -)"}
{"text":"Stopped in because it's close to my shop. Had the chicken finger sandwich a fry's. The chicken finger was more like a thin chicken breast lightly battered. Great sandwich. I plan on making more trips there for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"Invited by a friend to try the walleye special and took my husband. He loved the dinner. Great portions and came out hot and fresh. I had the chicken fingers at the Blue Ox on Sahara so I know these are also great, big strips of chicken breast and the chips are home made. I ordered a Baja Chicken Salad which is not on the menu but an occasional house special and was the best. Delightful neighborhood bar and restaurant. The server was friendly and a clean place. Great local place for a good meal and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Blue Ox on a whim, very glad I did! The food here was awesome. The prices are cheap and the quality and portion size are huge! Everything was fresh and tasted great. It is a Minnesota themed tavern and pretty cool on the inside. Definitely give it a try if you enjoy taverns."}
{"text":"By far the best bar in Vegas. I have been coming here since I've been able to drink. The first thing I noticed was how nice the staff was compared to bars that I've been to before. They're fast with drinks. They always look out for you and they all have a good sense of humor. Their prices are the cheapest I've ever seen. No one in Vegas is going to offer alcohol cheaper than here. Also, their food is amazing. If you want a good burger or chicken fingers, this is the place."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's smokey, but they have great bartenders, including the owner Mike. The friendliness separates them from the corporate bars like PTs Pubs.  It is a Minnesota bar. All Minny sports take precedence on TV.  Best Double burger in town, & only $8.99. It's the char flavor that makes it stand out. They also have the best chicken fingers in town, freshly breaded right after ordering."}
{"text":"5 stars for bartender service. 2 starts for waitress service. 2 stars for food. Overall negative experience, save for the guy behind the bar.  After I walked in and chose my seat (I agree with the review that said they need a \"seat yourself\" sign), the bartender told me the waitress would be with me and asked me if I'd like something to drink \"to speed up the ordering process\". He also offered to change the TV if I wasn't happy watching the hockey game. Very thoughtful!  Waitress came over after another couple minutes. I got the small chicken fingers with chips. The fingers came out piping hot and huge, as expected from reviews. (This was my first time at the Blue Ox.) But actually eating them was impossible. The batter was so thick that it didn't cook through and was wet and slimy on the inside. To make it worse, the homemade chips were ice cold.  I ended up picking off the offending undercooked breading and getting through one piece of plain chicken breast before the waitress checked on me (which took FOREVER). I hated to do it because I understand that I've chosen to eat in a bar, but I had to send them back to the kitchen. I'm not that kind of person, either. They were just gross.  Btw, when asked if they are normally breaded that thickly, she said with an air of pride, \"Yes, they are tempura battered.\" I know what tempura is, and it is not thick undercooked batter. Kind of the opposite, actually.  Thankfully they were cool about it and offered to make me something else. I chose the grilled cheese on sourdough with the chips again. The chips were piping hot and I like that they offered four different bread choices. It wasn't a remarkable grilled cheese or anything, but it made up a bit for the fingers.  Sadly, the experience at the end was not good either. I was basically ignored by the waitress after getting my grilled cheese. I sat for a good half an hour watching her take care of other tables multiple times. Not one glance in my direction. I actually had to go up to the bar myself and request a check because I really really had to go home. I slapped down money and called it a mistake I'll never make again.  Bottom line: I won't be back and I won't recommend this place to anyone for anything besides a beer and watching a game. Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went to see the Vikings/Seahawks play-off game(It's a Minnesota-based bar). Some of my friends are from Minnesota. I didn't eat anything, but our server, Jamie, was excellent. I never saw the bottom of my beer glass, even at 11am and it was a full bar. Plenty of tv's. Vikings lost on a missed 27 yard field goal attempt."}
{"text":"The portions are huge but you will enjoy every bite you take. The Chicken fingers I had were dipped in a succulent buffalo sauce and breaded perfectly. The cheese curds are highly recommended. The waiters are very attentive. You won't find good food like this anywhere in Vegas coming from a Vegas local."}
{"text":"I usually go to Blue ox because there food is good I have been coming here for 3 years. But today was the last day thanks to the so call waitress. She was super racist and rude since we walk in. Pamela if you're so racist your working in the wrong field! We got bad service on top of that she told me to go to HELL because I did not leave a tip and I left a big fat zero and a note telling her that next time she decides to talk bad about her customers to not do it in front of them! She took forever and beside that she was taking to the cook about how I told her that we were in a hurry and if she can take or order because we were ready. She even comment to the cook that she would take another 3 person order before use just because I had complain. Well Pamela I'll be sure to tell all my co-worker and friends never to go there again or if they really decide to go not to get service from you at all. You might just tell them to go to hell as well shame on you Pamela!"}
{"text":"When we arrived,  bartender named Ted I think had a bad attitude from the jumo. The server was nice and helpful. I ordered a philly which was not a philly at all. It was 1\"x1\" squares of meat with more cheese than bread. Everytime we asked the bartender for a drink we were bothering him it seemed like. Took 22 mins to pay our bill because the bartender had to \"catch up\". weird."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast one morning. Good food for a fair price. Good service as well. It's a perfect little neighborhood place I plan to visit again."}
{"text":"The turkey melt is alright. I should've gotten the philly cheesesteak. That smelled great. I really like the sampler tho."}
{"text":"I love this place. There is no better bar to watch MN sports. But even if you couldnt care less about that they've got great home-made chicken strips, the reubans are great. The minnesota viking sandwich is great if you like really powerful horseradish sauce. But my personal favorite is the steak and eggs. They cook their steaks to a tender, perfectly seasoned perfection. And best of all they have $2 drafts of Hams.  The staff is also great and friendly, in four football seasons ive never had a bad experience with the staff or the food."}
{"text":"Came in the other night with a group of friends, we had time to kill after a wedding and we were waiting on the reception. The waitress was very attentive, each couple ordered chicken fingers to share and it was plenty of food, and the best chicken fingers I've ever had! Wish this place wasn't so far from where we lived or we would come back ASAP!"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if it was possible. I've been frequenting this venue for 6+ years to watch MN games. Up until yesterday I loved the place. Apparently saving a seat for your friend is prohibited at this place. Although everyone else was saving seats for their friends on this occasion & every other time I am in there. Owner came up & yelled at me for holding a seat for my friend & flat out lying to me & telling me that patrons were leaving because they could not find a seat. The place was 1/2 full at best so don't lie to me telling me some bullsh*t that patrons are leaving. I could see the door because I was watching it for my friend to come through it & no patron ever left the bar (only to smoke & then they came back in). I specifically arrived 40 minutes early to get a seat before kickoff & although someone was in the seat I wanted when I arrived I took a different spot. Some @$$hole arrives 35 minutes after the game has started & just because he can't have the seat I was saving (my friend was getting off work & on their way) he went all crybaby to the owner & hence I got yelled at. Yet the best part of it was there were 2 open seats on the other side of me that the crybaby wouldn't take because they weren't on the long face of the bar but instead the short side where I mind you a TV is completely pointed & you can see the same as I could. I could even see the actual TV that was pointed to the side bar. There were other people sitting on the short side of the bar that sit there every week so apparently you can see the TV otherwise they wouldn't sit there. There was also an open seat at the other end of the bar that the crybaby could have taken but wouldn't. Also many tables in the bar with just 1 person sitting at them - why didn't the owner go up to those one person tables & tell each of those people that they needed to combine tables & sit together with each other because he was having patrons leave (which was a lie)? The owner is a complete jerk & a liar (he definitely does not know what \"Minnesota Nice\" means) & it was completely uncalled for what he did to me by coming up & yelling very loudly at me in front of the whole bar causing a scene.  He definitely just created bad voo-jue for himself. I know plenty of MN fans that frequent that bar & after I told them what the owner did to me will never go in the bar again themselves. I will never go to the Blue Ox (any location) again & give them a penny of my hard earned money again."}
{"text":"Just came in for a quick drink. I just missed my bus on the way home from work and this bar was located just behind the bus stop. The staff was super friendly and the environment was nice and relaxing. A great place to hang out after a long day at work. I was highly impressed and I think I found a new place to be at on a regular basis now. I only ordered one drink and didn't have enough money to tip the bartender and I feel horrible about it but I will more than make up for it on my next visit. Keep up the great job guys. See you again soon."}
{"text":"If you are a Vikings fan... this is the bar for you.  I'm not but my husband is.  (Go Giants!) The bar itself is filled with Minnesota pictures, sports memorabilia and food.  You can smoke in the entire restaurant so it has that certain smell.     As far as the menu, you can order the Minnesota Twin burger, the Kirby Puckett, the Timber Wolf French Dip and even Walleye.  There is a great variety of food since it is open 24/7. We ordered the Triple Decker Club and the Chicken Sandwich.  Crinkle cut french fries accompany the meals.  There were 6 of us and decided to get the homemade potato chips.  These are pretty darn good! Not healthy by any means but tasty!  My sandwich was good but I would just say good... not great.  The chicken sandwich was not chicken breast but ground chicken.  The hubby would say it was just ok and not really what he expected.   We have ordered the chicken fingers in the past and those are easily split between two people.  Huge portion and very filling.    Our waitress did an amazing job.  She was funny, kept the drinks coming and chatted with us for a bit.   So the service was great.    We have tried to come here on a Sunday to watch the game and it's packed!  If you want a seat, get there early....   I was surprised actually by how many Vikings fans are here in Vegas.    All in all, it is a great place for games or after a night of drinking and need some greasy food to fill the stomach.  Probably would give them 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"Came in for Vikings game (first time guest).  Will try again, but earlier next time.  I ended up leaving before I could order anything.  No \"Minnesota nice\" detected here with staff....  Pro:  Vikings atmosphere.  Cool to have lots of Purple and Gold jerseys.  Food smelled and looked good (as it was passing me).  Con: Turned off by staff, boarding on almost rude.  Get it that they are busy...  but, felt I was in way, and was a problem for them to order drink and get a menu for food.  Could only see one cook in kitchen, not 100% sure.  Probably reason for experience, under staffed for a known busy day.  Will give them another shot though.  Will come earlier....  Rated average, as I could tell and feel stress and it was conveyed in both verbal (tone) and body language.  No excuse for conveyance of such image IMO."}
{"text":"The Blue Ox is a Minnesota themed bar that features gaming, a pool table, and dart board. They have a pretty good selection of beers on tap as well. The food here is excellent and they have huge portion sizes. I'd recommend their gigantic chicken fingers, which will definitely hit the spot. The Blue Ox is a nice local bar that offer great service, food, and a nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"This place has great service, reasonably priced food and beer. The sliders, burgers, fries, and homemade chips are awesome. I'm going to try the chicken fingers next time because I heard they are amazing.  This place is Minnesota themed and there is a good crowd of people in their 30s. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Whenever I need a touch of Minnesota I come here.  Try the cheese curds, Minnesota Twin burger, Kirby Puckett sandwich, and the best of all is their Walley. They also have Hamms Beer on special everyday."}
{"text":"The staff here is always super friendly, not to mention they typically remember you and your order preferences after just a few visits. As far as food is concerned I've never had something here I didn't like. Everything is made in house and it shows. The service is fast and high quality and all reasonably priced. Highly recommend this little Vikings dive bar!"}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken fingers in Las Vegas if not anywhere. They are huge, made in house and you get a ton (easily shareable). This is no joke, go now and get an order. It won't cost you but like $8 and will be glad you did. They have other food too and it is all well above average for a bar."}
{"text":"At first I am told, \"Hey guys, tonight we are meeting at the Blue Ox\"...and I am like WTF is a Blue Ox and my buddy tells me \"Oh it's this bar right across from this Walmart in this office/commercial building on Eastern.... and i'm like thinking to myself how bad this place must be....WRONGGGGGG!!!!  (And KICK MYSELF IN THE FACE) After taking an evening to visit the Blue Ox, I can tell you one thing, it makes me feel like Paul Bunyan, majestically riding Babe through the endless forests, swinging his axe with no cares in the world.........Focus!! back on topic!  2 words - CHICKEN FINGERS I go into Blue Ox without knowing anything about this place, the ambiance, the food. the staff, etc. So I sit down, enjoy a few of the $2 PBR's and find myself a bit peckish. I call the bar keep over and ask for a recommendation, he instantly says the Chicken Fingers. I think to myself, \"Bar chicken fingers, oh joy, they must taste like EVERY OTHER BAR IN VEGAS\". Alas, I AM hungry, so I accept his recommendation and wait for my Tyson's frozen fingers to arrive.  A few minutes later I see this giant plate of something head in my direction, thinking that this must be a plate of nachos, a party platter or something. BOOM, a plate straight from heaven falls in my lap. HOMEMADE Chicken Fingers, each the size of a baby arm, WITH homemade chips! Fantastic! Everything about these morsels of chicken were great....a huge unexpected surprise. I am completely defeated by the quantity of food, barely able to finish the last finger and last sip of my beer and call it a night. What an adventure!   All at this little place they call the Blue Ox. What an unexpected surprise...."}
{"text":"Had the burgers, they were fresh, delicious, and homemade taste. Fries were good, homemade potato chips were very good! Service was super friendly. It's a bar, but it didn't taste like bar food. Only negative is that we can't eat here a lot because it's a bar, we can't bring the kids.  Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is the best! We started coming here from a recommendation from my friend and we love it! We love the atmosphere, the food, and the staff. This is one of the only places in town with brown gravy for us Canadians. It's great watching the Knights games here as well. Jaime is an awesome bartender. I like that the staff here isn't over the top friendly and it just feels like you're hanging out with your friends in a casual setting. We are regulars and plan on continuing to be!"}
{"text":"Ok ok ok, I see you Blue Ox. I found myself on a late night WalMart date, location was perfect. 24 hour kitchen, yessss. So Scott took my order over the phone as I was checking out at Wally World. Great phone presence and accurate estimate of the time it would take for my food. I arrived and decided to have a drink with a friend and eat. Price was exceptional, and I won playing Keno to boot. Scott was undeniably well spoken and the music was refreshing. I guess I shouldn't forget to mention that the wings were noteworthy. Well done Blue Ox, and thank you sincerely Mr. Scott. I'll definitely bring my business back here."}
{"text":"* Herb Alpert's \"Route 101\" playing on juke box * Kirby Pucket sandwich still delicious after 20 years * Welcoming, clean atmosphere  * Homemade potato chips * Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great food. The Tukey Ruben was awesome so was the regular Ruben was amazing.. Had Hedi for a waitress and she was great. The Cole slaw was also on point."}
{"text":"Ted is an amazing bartender. He was very attentive and friendly. I will definitely come back to see him."}
{"text":"Hands down my FAVORITE place in Las Vegas. Whether I'm feeling hungry, in the need for a quick drink, or need a place to hang out with friends and shoot some pool this place is my go to! Amazing home cooked style meals and attentive friendly service all the time. Chicken fingers are my favorite ! As well as all of their home made soups are delicious. Oh and they're open 24/7! :) Love the BlueOx!"}
{"text":"The best chicken fingers in town, no question. Always freshly cooked. Along with a cold beer, I'm happy. Can't review anything else, but I'll update if I do."}
{"text":"I love this bar! The best chicken fingers can be found right here. Killer bar food, and the friendliest bartenders around!"}
{"text":"I asked for the popular dish and I was told the chicken fingers so that along with a lemonade with a side of ranch is what I ordered. Service was a tad slow but nothing really to gripe about. The Ambiance was very nice very quiet bar area with a happy staff. I would rate the food 5 out of 5 and I definitely can't see myself returning and ordering the exact same thing. I did not finish my plates even though I am a heavy eater for a petite female which was great because I was able to take some home. I recommend this restaurant exclamation point"}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers ever. Great service. Feels like family here. Bartender Jamie took good care of us as usual."}
{"text":"Cute, quiet, little neighborhood joint. Great for lunch with some fun co-workers. Not expensive, and the sandwiches are excellent."}
{"text":"Chicken strips are great! Service is great as well. Friendly staff, cheap drinks, tasty bar food and close to airport - enough said!"}
{"text":"Chicken fingers were quite good! Waitress got our order wrong - so when we asked about it she got quite rude! We ordered chicken fingers and fries, cheese curds and the sampler to which her reply was - you know thats an appetizer? We said yes - husband wanted to eat as a meal - just bring it all out at one time! She said ok and will bring extra plates. When we asked about the appetizer we never got she got pissed!!   Saying we never ordered an appetizer and then told us - it's a bar, the music is loud - speak up! Really???  Won't be back nor will we recommend it to any friends. She could of handled the situation a little bit better!"}
{"text":"Poor management and bad bartenders. Place is a joke. 30 year old carpeting. Save your time and money. Smells like vomit and get this...they charged the designated driver for a cranberry juice (4.00). Pathetic!"}
{"text":"My 4 star rating is solely for the food. My hubster and I have always been curious about this place as we live right up the street and since the little one was spending the night at the in laws, we decided to pop in. It wasn't busy but then again it was a Thursday around 6pm. My husband ordered the jalapeno burger that came with thick crinkle cut fries and I had the chicken fingers. I only ordered them because I couldn't figure out what I wanted and I didn't want to hold up the waitress any longer so I was expecting your typical dive chicken fingers...fried with a nasty after taste and thin. I was wrong! Hands down these are the best chicken fingers I have had EVER eaten in Las Vegas (Cane's comes in a close second). Juicy, thick and hand breaded and they give you a shiyet load of them! It came with home made potato chips however I am not a potato chip fan period, so my the hubster ate them and I ate his fries (which were awesome). He also had a few of my chicken fingers and after we were done eating he said \"i feel like we've had fingers like that before.\" We figured out that the fingers here are closely similar to the fingers at Cane's, another fave place of ours! My hubster also raved about the jalapeno burger saying it was juicy and great tasting."}
{"text":"Best local bar stop after work! We somehow meet up with the happy hour! Love the service! And location is minutes away from work (Airport) pretty cheap prices and super good food! Been here about 6 times and it's never a fail! Made joint our hang out spot after work with colleagues. Not bad! Great environment."}
{"text":"I have now had the HONOR of visiting all three of the Las Vegas BLUE OX locations, with my visit on March 10, 2013, to this central one.  Just like the other two, this one is equally spectacular, mostly because of ANGELIKA, who has the \"FIVE Ps\" needed to be a successful server: She's Polite, Pretty, Perky, Professional & Perfect!  (She also laughs at my moronic jokes.)  When I walked into this location on this Sunday afternoon, I felt obligated to \"introduce\" myself (and tell Angelika of my \"experience\" at the other places).  She smiled with recognition at the names I mentioned and said, \"Oh!  You're already family!\"  And allowed me to sit at one of their BEST tables.  She then \"talked me into\" ordering the Pot Roast, and I'm sure glad she did.  it was  cooked up superbly, then Angelika excellently served it.  It filled me up for sure, leaving NO ROOM for dessert,which is actually a GOOD thing, as I am a Diabetic.  You know, there is one thing that I sometimes do at these restaurants, that I almost NEVER do at any other family-owned eatery:  I'll sometimes give the server a very large tip and tell her, \"Please give half of this tip to the COOK.\"  That's what I did today and friends, it was worth every penny, believe me.  One thing I really like about the acoustics in this particular bar & grill, is the fact that you can sit on a side with almost NO noisy music or if you prefer, you can sit on the side where the music is somewhat louder.  So, if someone wants a quiet conversation with a potential lover or a \"business lunch\" with a client, you can achieve either by sitting on the northern side of the establishment, which is extremely quiet and has \"elevated\" seating.  The bartender, TED, is ultra-fantastic at what he does (he does EVERYTHING!) and even though he isn't from Minnesota (as are the owners), he was from my former state of Hawaii.  I moved here from Maui in 1992, while he arrived in the Las Vegas Valley in 1995.  It needs to be noted that Hawaiians are also very friendly and personable, as are folks from the Gopher State.  And, as information, I was a resident of the Twin Cities while attending the U of MN in the late 1960s and early 1970s, so I'm used to being around friendly Minnesotans.  In fact, my first wife was a wonderful born/bred Minnesota girl who attended college in St. Cloud.  There is also another terrific bartender named TOM, who has been there around 5 years and who hails from Rochester NY.  He cooks up one fantastic breakfast, every bit as tasty as his contemporaries.  He's also a wonderful conversationalist (when he has the time from his other duties), because there are things a man will only tell his bartender.  Bartenders are, as someone once said, \"Unlicensed psychologists, and BETTER at it.\"  This is a quiet and laid-back place with a regular crowd of happy patrons and I'm glad to now be one of them.  It's located on busy Eastern Avenue (near Patrick Lane) and is convenient to everywhere in the Metro area.  Stop in soon, folks, and find out for yourself how special this place truly is."}
{"text":"Literally atrocious and slow. Food, good, but service was just so slow. Bathrooms are filthy! Friends and I went to have a meal because sunset park was packed (a festival was going on) and less than 10 people in the bar took over 30 minutes to just cash out. Let alone the attitude we got when we tried to sit at the bar but that was for \"gaming\" customers only. Once we pointed out the lack of people the bartender reluctantly \"allowed\" us to sit at the bar but only if we agreed to \"move\" if someone wanted to gamble, which we, as locals and bartenders, completely understood. Besides the poor service, lack of any welcome when you arrive, and food that you can find at any decent bar in Las Vegas, it's not worth batting an eye towards."}
{"text":"I've never been inside an Ox before let alone a Blue Ox, but I dig it. Blue Ox is better than blue balls, blue eye shadow and blue anything else maybe. Babe knows what's up.  Blue Ox is a small dimly lit tavern that you probably pass every day. That's okay with  me. Keep passing it PLEASE. More Ox for me:) They do have regulars I'm sure, but I don't know any of them. My favorite group was this older man and I swear his sister wives. This lady had the longest french braid with the bumped bangs in the front and a shirt buttoned up to the roof. The other lady looked slightly more modern with a slutty skirt suit on. Definitely 3rd wife material. Not Boss like 1st wife. Other than that the crowd is all over the place from what I gather.  FOOD: All about them chicken fangers. Not to be confused with fingers. You have to say fangers because you have to say it with love cuz they are in a class above the entire universe of chicken fingers. They are the size of Arsenio Hall's big ass alien fingers. All white meat dipped in that crunchy beer batter made fresh to order. NOTHING BEATS THEM. They have different sauces to dip them in and always served with their homemade potato chips and house-made Ranch. The fangers are the star here, but there are other delicious items on the menu as well. Example: Grilled chicken salad. I try to stay clear of fried foods most of the time so I do get this salad loaded with chicken, eggs, tomatoes and all the other salad fixings I like. However, my cheat day breakfast item of choice is the Country Fried Steak. I have only had it once, but hot damn it left a mark on my heart and on my thighs. It's the size of the Hustler Club. Excellent homemade soups are bomb, too and the kitchen is open 24/7.  DRINKS: Dirt cheap. I want to say my guy had a tall, spicy Bloody Mary for $3. No drinks are over $5 that I have ordered. The bartender is quick and friendly. Hell, all the staff is super cool.  Did I mention the jukebox? Full of 80's, Dave Matthews, Blink 182, etc. I spend more money on the music then I do on the food and booze!    Blue Ox is my bar. I come here and can set the mood with the music and always have a good time. Please, keep passing it by and leave it all to me:)"}
{"text":"Long time to finish but they batter their own chicken fingers. Bar food but good place to watch sports."}
{"text":"I've worked in the area for 10yrs and we've never been here....but, seeing pics and reviews on Yelp changed that. Our office ordered the fabulous chicken fingers. Moist, lightly breaded, not greasy....and the homemade chips. FANTASTIC! Actually have leftovers that went home. I know we will be back for more another day."}
{"text":"A couple of Out Of Towers looking for a comfy,  clean place to grab a beer and a bite.  Yelped and went on to 3 places before found this place.  SOOOOOOOO happy.  Sandwich was hot all the way through,  homemade chips were Yummy! The staff was constantly cleaning and Amber . . . You're perfect.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Not truly a \"4-Star\" establishment, but if you are a regular they treat you like family.  A great East-Side dive for those who who just just want cheap-and-easy bar food, video poker, beer, and a place to watch the game. Btw, this is Minnesota Vikings bar, and even though I bleed gold and green, I have no problems coming here often.  Try the Kirby Puckett: roast beef, tomato, red onion, and cream cheese on a hoagie. Don't forget to get it with a side of home-made potato chips.  With pool tables, nooks, plenty of room at the bar, and a staff of folks who always remember your face, but maybe not your name, this is exactly what you want in a local hangout. All of the above with zero pretension. Gotta love it!!"}
{"text":"I love this place...all of us from UNLV go up here for the cheap drinks. The wait staff is awesome. If you are going to go up there...ask for the server Jamie! He rocks!  The bartender Ted is awesome too!   Great spot and a lot of fun! Plus a digital jukebox!"}
{"text":"The bar tender Jamie is amazing. Super helpful and very kind. He helped us choose out the perfect drinks, and even shared a smile with us. We are not avid drinkers nor know of anything other than your standard margarita, but he showed us a grape drink that was really good as well as a pineapple drink.   However, when we transferred to a table, we had a waitress with blonde hair and glasses who was rude as all hell!!!! We wanted to pay for our drinks before the rest of our group got here, but our waitress said no because it was, \"too much work\". We are baffled. And then after I called one of the people in our party to let them know the situation, she came over and had a rude attitude saying, \"if you really wanna pay for your drinks, just go to the bar and he'll ring you up!\" Ummm, excuse me? Why were you listening to my conversation over the phone?? No, that's rude!!  So I said, \"No thank you. We're fine. We'll just pay as a group so it's not a difficult task for you.\" .  First time at this bar, and probably last."}
{"text":"Went for a burger and a few beers tonight- a good local dive bar. The mushroom Swiss burger was good- my friends chicken tenders were breaded like fish and chips- tasted god but not what I expected. They had limited beers, but they did have a lagunitas on tap..."}
{"text":"Great service. We had the chicken fingers & homemade chips, the chicken fingers were huge & the chips were delicious. Our waiter was so accommodating."}
{"text":"The portions are huge, delicious and well priced! The waitress was nice and attentive. We ordered buffalo chicken strips, they were breaded perfectly and just the right amount of sauce. The fries were homemade I believe, if they're not they sure taste like it! This place is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken strips ever!  Homemade potato chips are amazing and I have always had really good service, love this place!"}
{"text":"I go to the Blue OX at least once a week. I get there in the morning and have breakfast. The food is always good, and served quickly. The wait staff is friendly and professional.  It has a pleasant atmosphere, and is just a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I enjoy this little bar/lounge for lunch dates with my co-workers/friends.  We come here at least once a week to splurge on something fried, and most importantly the Chocolate Lava cake.  This dessert is definitely on my top 5 in Las Vegas.  If you love chocolate cake, this dessert is for you.  It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and drizzles of chocolate and caramel sauce.  Yum!  I usually order the Tuna melt and french fries here which also comes with cole slaw and a pickle slice.  My friends always order the Walleye Fish lunch or dinner and rave about the chicken tenders.    I plan to come back and try more items on my cheat days!  Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (58/365)."}
{"text":"The food is alright, but there's this lame ass waitress with a  dumb Boulder Highway geisha hairdo, named Heidi who just really really sucks at being a waitress.  She's gross, and the dining area is gross. All the surfaces have some kinda film on them.   Food good... Heidi, Bad."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once without getting chicken fingers and once with chicken fingers. When I went without getting chicken fingers, I was an idiot. Now I have learned from that mistake and will never make it again.  This is an unassuming bar I've must have passed hundreds of times. This may be my new dive bar. The first time I went here, they had Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA on tap. This should have been my first clue that this place was good. That is still, by far, my favorite brew. I don't think they have it on tap anymore, but who cares. Hams was $2 a pint and I'm not even sure that is a happy hour price. Not a lot of times I've got some drinking on that only cost me $10.   Now. Chicken Fingers. These are huge. HUGE. I'm not even sure fingers is an accurate description of what you get. More like chicken arms or something. They are ginormous. They are also as delicious as they are HUGE. They don't cost that much (less than $10 I'm sure) and you get a bunch of chicken ARMS. The breading is great, it's got that flavor that you can only get deep frying it but the breading remains crispy. Once you break apart that breading, you'll see some beautiful white chicken meat. Seriously, some of the best chicken fingers I've ever had.   Oh what's that? You get home made potato chips. I almost opted for fries, but I had a food guardian angel tell me NO. I'm thankful for that. Their homemade potato chips are fantastic. They have a great crisp to them, no soggy chips here. They have the right amount of salt on them. Get yourself some chicken fingers, homemade potato chips, and Hams."}
{"text":"My parents went to breakfast here 2 weekends in a row and couldn't stop raving about how wonderful their breakfasts were.  We had friends in town from South Dakota, who are huge Vikings fan, and this is a Vikings bar.  We all went out to breakfast.  My husband and I each ordered an omelet.  He ordered a side of pancakes.  Everyone else ordered either an omelet or country fried steaks.  The omelet was a 6 on a scale of 10...not bad but not anything to write home about either.  My husband felt the same way.  The pancakes were horrible!  They were rubbery and slightly burnt!  The \"sourdough\" toast tasted like someone spread garlic all over it, wasn't toasted and came to our table cold.  I didn't try the potatoes because they didn't look good.  Coffee was average.  Waitress was very friendly.   My parents still like their breakfasts and intend on going back.  I don't think my husband and I will though.  However, in the event we do, I will only come back when the Vikings are playing...by the sounds of it...this is a pretty hopping bar during the football season."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. My only complaint is wrong NFL team! Lol Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch ordered the special chicken Philly, the chicken tasted slimy and under cooked. After explaining to the waitress the she argued with us the about the type of chicken and the way it's cooked! Then took one of our plates back to remake sandwich and brought back old cold fries! Felt like she could of handled the situation more professional, so since I did not eat at all the rating is completely on service and the way my situation was handled!"}
{"text":"Minnesota style bar and grill located across the street from the airport.  My significant other, a Vikings fan, brought me, a Saints fan, here to watch the game. There was plenty of table and bar seating. The bar seating had video poker gaming.  The food menu had some Minnesota favorites like cheese curds. They were delicious. We also had the chicken tenders which were very large but tasty.  The staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I had lunch at the Blue Ox on Valentines Day. The food was good, reasonably priced and we had a with good attentive server. It is casual spot and our food came out quickly. Nice portions. Its a good spot for lunch that isn't fast food. The sports memorabila featured throughout is good stuff if you a sport fan and not intrusive if you aren't. TV's that are visible from anywhere you seat.  I had the turkey club with homemade chips and my lunch companion had the dinner meatloaf (more than they could finish). Both very good and hot! You are able to have a quiet conversation. A very good experience."}
{"text":"Blue Ox Tavern is a Minnesota Vikings and Minnesota Twins bar located on Eastern Avenue across the street from the McCarren Center Walmart Supercenter. At the entrance where guests transition from the outside into the dimly lit environment of the tavern, they are greeted by Minnesota Twins memorbelia. Throughout the pub there are pictures of Minnesota Twins and Vikings memorbelia. The Minnesota Twins and Vikings are displayed on the TVs throughout baseball and football seasons. Where the Minnesota Twins and Vikings are professional teams that play to win, the Blue Ox Tavern staff is a lousy unprofessional business team that plays to loose.     I work close to Blue Ox Tavern. So between work and errands, I stopped there for lunch. This visit was around 2:30 PM on a Monday afternoon. And this was my second time. When I walked in nobody greeted me. There is a want for a \"Please seat yourself\" sign. After sitting down for a few minutes Pamela, the bartender became Pamela the waitress. I ordered a Coke. This time it wasn't borderline flat. After a few minutes, Pamela returns from the sporadically patronized bar to take my order. My mind was set on the BLT.      Pricing and selection trails behind competitive taverns including the Village Pub. When I looked at the menu, daily dinner specials and lunch specials were nonexistent. The value for the money trails behind commendable nearby restaurants including the Village Pub and Miller's Ale House. Here are a few examples of paying too much for average food in a mediocre setting. The onion rings were around $6, a Philly cheese steak was around $15, and Fish and Chips were $10.99. Most strikingly dessert is missing from the four page menu. Furthermore, their dinners are missing the included salad or soup that competitors such as Village Tavern include. Below this review, the picture tour includes all four pages of the menu.      When I ordered the BLT, I showed my Waitress Pamela on my phone, their very own Yelp check-in offer that takes $1 off the bill. Pamela representing Blue Ox Tavern did not accept their own Yelp check-in offer. She says, \"No, No, No, No, we do not accept the Yelp check-in offer. The Sahara location accepts it.\" She takes my phone and looks at the screen claiming that the Sahara location accepts it.\" Humm! I showed her that the north to south road on the screen that said Eastern Avenue with a Yelp dot for this location touching my phone's GPS dot under the Yelp check-in special was not Sahara Avenue. She is still claiming it is for the Sahara location. Pamela also said that she'd mention this to her boss and that they were taking the Yelp check-in special off. This bad business practice is not an isolated incident. In a previous review 21 days ago, Beki. C also mentioned this. So, if this was a Vikings game, Pamela caused her team to have a fumble. To support the fact that they did not follow the Yelp check-in $1 off special, following this review I posted a picture of the Yelp check-in offer and my bill. Additionally, I did not appreciate that Pamela was attentive to the regulars in back of me and practically ignored me and failing to ask if I wanted a Coke refill.      The BLT was a solid sandwich. Realistically with the sundry of restaurants serving BLTs in the Las Vegas metropolitan area it was average. I requested a lot of mayonnaise on the sandwich. They placed a little bit on it. It was good. The last visit they placed a lot of mayonnaise on it and the sandwich was tasty enough to lead me back here. The fries were nothing special tasting just as good as a bag of frozen fries that Walmart sells across the street. If only there was ketchup on the table, it might of made a slight difference.      After paying the $10.06 plus tip, I walked around. At the right of the Tavern there is an area where you can hang out and play pool. If you leave this area to the left of the large picture of the blue ox, you are back in the center of the Tavern at the bar. Here they have gaming machines. On account of the fact that they need Caveman Keno with digital Keno machines, I have passed over gambling here. Now aware of their questionable business practice I regard gaming here with throwing my money in the garbage.       Blue Ox Tavern did not have the integrity to follow their own policy that is the customer gets a $1 off their bill with a Yelp check-in. However, I have integrity and follow my own policies. One of my policies is that when a business does not abide by a Yelp check-in special, I deduct a star. That is being nice because several Yelpers will righteously give the business 1 star. Concurrent to my policy I will suspend the business for at least six months and spread the word. In conclusion, Blue Ox Tavern is a convenient tavern to my work and errands that serves a decent BLT in a Minnesota Vikings and Twins tavern without a smile and integrity. The Minnesota Vikings and Twins deserve a better bar."}
{"text":"Real close to work. Ordered chicken fingers. Great! House potato chips! Amazing."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers on this globe. No joke- hand battered, super crispy and so juicy. And the Minnesota twin burger is excessively larger and delicious by the way. The bartender and waitress are super sweet as well."}
{"text":"Great place! We couldn't find anything that is working in this area on Christmas Day beside blue ox central. We had great lunch there and played pool table. Food was really good. We were only one customers there so service was quick also."}
{"text":"Our go to place when nothing else sounds good, Always a great burger, and creative seasonal sides. Family owned and operated and loyal employees like Barbara, make it a great place to decompress; sit in a booth, a table or high table, away from the bar and pool tables. Who knows you may end up staying longer to play."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken tenders and they are awesome. Hand battered and huge, twice the size of most tenders. Comes with homemade chips that where just as amazing. The place was very nice, well lit, and felt like a nice place to bring the family. They however are unable to serve anyone under the age of twenty one due to some kind of smoking law. I will definatly  be going back!"}
{"text":"The Blue Ox Central has the most amazing, perfect, batter dipped, deep fried food in Las Vegas, if not The United States! Massive portions.  Reasonable prices. Unbelievable fresh quality. Served piping hot, by amicable, accommodating staff. The sauces are delectable. Please don't tell anybody! This place is a true hidden gem. I'd like to keep it that way."}
{"text":"The prices here are pretty great, they got big TVs so it's a good place to watch the game. However when the check comes, they always seem to give back the wrong amount of change, and not in your favor."}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken fingers in town. I have been going to the Blue ox for at least ten years. It is great to see what a great job Mike has done running the place since his fathers untimely death last year . Love this place."}
{"text":"This review is only for the chicken fingers. I have never tried anything else on the menu.  Chicken fingers are hand battered and fried to perfection. Best fingers in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Anyone remember the song \"Du Hast\" by Rammstein?  We've rewritten it:  \"Blue....Blue Ox...Blue Ox, B*tch!\"  I haven't been to Blue Ox in a while, but I used to go every Sunday night for karaoke back in the day.  This place has the BEST chicken fingers I've ever had in my life.  No joke.  Its been a while, like I said, so I don't remember all of the things I've tried here, but everything was always delicious, and the staff was always super great.  I've been craving good chicken fingers, and I'm off my nutrition plan next week, so  a trip to Blue Ox might just be in order..."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken strips. Also one of the rare places in Vegas that serves cheese curds."}
{"text":"Went on a Vikings Sunday.  Standing room only.  Chicken fingers were great.  Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing too special here. Laid back neighborhood bar with decent drink prices (especially during happy hour). The food isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Ya know I love the food at this place the service has always been decent however tonight was a different story after waiting 30 minutes for the server to even come to the table not only was she rude but horribly slow with everything she did but said oh one minute there's someone else in front of you at which point I had to ask for menus only to get one. After another 15 minutes we finally got drinks. Since she had to explain how busy she was and that she was the only person on the floor I was surprised that the food came out rather quick for her being so \"busy\". Blue ox hire yourself a new server. I can say I won't be back if she's on shift that's for sure."}
{"text":"love dropping into this place anytime day or night. best chicken fingers in town. forewarned u wont want to eat fingers anywhere else after this. such a friendly staff. always so welcoming. i really like that about a place"}
{"text":"Good r-b sticking food, not upscale, but not a dive.  But it's a pub. No I would not take kids there.  Solid alternative to chain restaurants. I had a steak - it was fine, did not care for the cheese infused Texas Toast. Service was nice and friendly."}
