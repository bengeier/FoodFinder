{"text":"One of the best date nights my girl and I have had in a long time. Service was the greatest food was delicious and the price was perfect. 3 courses with steak and lobster for 18.99 a person can't beat that! Creme brûlée was delicious and so was the bread pudding. Our server Earl was the greatest and the best server we've had since moving out here to Las Vegas 6 months ago. Atmosphere of restaurant was very romantic and quiet making it the perfect date night spot."}
{"text":"Reasonable Prices for Average Food.   Restaurant (like most other competing Vegas Locals Casinos) seems to mainly cater to older local patrons using Comps.   We had a Reservation for 7:00 pm on a Saturday. The dining room had one other party. As we left another party arrived, however the place was empty.   The light were turned up brightly. The table setting did not include a Butter Knife. The Bread basket was a mixture plus three different butters, The cracker bread was good, the rest was below average,   We ordered two shrimp cocktails ( $ 8.00 for 4 Shrimp ) , the shrimp were large, however tough from overcooking and dry from sitting around for a while.   The French Onion Soup was very good and the Lobster Bisque was OK.   The Beef Stroganoff came in a gigantic dish, however the sauce was bland , the pasta was out of a box and the meat was low quality. The Steak Diane was a huge cut of good beef, cooked as ordered and again a bland boring sauce.   For dessert we tried the Cheesecake and Double Chocolate fudge cake. These Items make this place worth stopping for. Just Order Dessert and Coffee. Friendly service at moderate prices. Your Players Card will get you a discount."}
{"text":"aaron who wrote the other review was \"not\" at the yukon grill. sounds like he went to sourdough cafe, because yukon doesn't serve steak & eggs. now to my review.  my husband & i have been going to ac's casino since it opened.we've been to the buffet & sour dough cafe, but never to yukon because i never saw people going in. then they put a menu stand with the specials & a paper menu with everything & prices. the food sounded great & the prices were reasonable, so when my brother came to town, we went there & boy were we surprised. very nice inside, but we were there for the food & it was \"great\", and so was the service. i had rack of lamb, my husband, prime rib, my brother pecan crusted swordfish & his girl, the chicken marsala. of course i tasted all of them & one was better than the next. the chef, mark, came out, introduced himself & made us feel very comfortable. when my brother came back to town for my birthday, we went back on thurs & it was wonderful & when mark found out it was my birthday & i mentioned beef wellington, which was not on the menu, we went back friday night & the wellington was fabulous. my brother got us a gift certificate & we've been back every week. they are open thursday - sun 5-10pm. there is only one problem we've found is, trying to decide what to choose. try it, i know you'll love it. diane & pat cappolla las vegas, nv"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service,special mention to Earl T. My friend from Berlin was impressed with the the food,ambience and superior service!"}
{"text":"Came here last night unexpectedly.They have a $19.99 NY Steak and Shrimp \"fall special\"..the rolls were warm and fresh so was the salad..the toppings for the baked potato were AWESOME.The steak was small but it was good..I will be coming back again for sure..Giving it a 4 star because i wasnt impressed with the dessert"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, good service, great food, fair pricing and you will not leave hungry. Been here many times over the years similar to Rons at the Arizona Charle on Decatur. Ask for Earl great server."}
{"text":"Great place for a special occasion. 4-Star dining at 3-Star prices. I particularly like the chateaubriand steak special for two. The players card special varies from month to month but it's always a great value since it includes a desert. The ambiance and service are equal to what you get in gourmet steak houses around town. Always treated well here. Reservations not a must but a good idea on weekends. We've used this place for family birthday gatherings and arranged a cake etc. Again, great value."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed dining here, it reminds me of old Vegas. Never had a bad meal until last night. We tried the \"special\" Steak Diane and I was extremely disappointed. The clam chowder must have been cooked for way too long, even though we arrived soon after the restaurant opened. It was way too thick and the clams were like rubber. The steak was very thin and quite tough. Vegetables seemed to have been frozen, then boiled. All were served lukewarm! I've had better meals in a coffee shop. The only good course was the dessert. The server brought out meals for several tables at once on a cart. We watched them sit there and get cold.  So sad to see this lovely room go downhill."}
{"text":"Located inside and upstairs this place recalls the glory days of college dining halls.  Ugh... I think my omelet stayed with me all day. Something like 15 hours of energy from the grease of gross of my omelet... Blech.  3.49 cent strajk and eggs, if you're a member of the rewards club... Otherwise its 7.99.  Skip it...."}
{"text":"If you want a fabulous steak cooked perfectly every time, this is the place to go. Lobster is still my favorite (twin tails) but can only splurge on that once in awhile. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"Affordable Steakhouse!  I'm kicking myself because I waited so long to try it.  We started with Tempura Artichoke Hearts, which were little balls of cream cheese \"stuffed\" artichoke hearts. It was just the right amount of cream cheese to compliment & not overpower. Came with some sort of light creamy sauce to dip them in. It was plain by itself, but paired perfectly for dipping.  I chose the rack of lamb for my entree & my partner had the Prime Rib (Charlie Cut). For less than $30, I got 8 beautiful lamb chops in a light bernaise sauce. Cooked to a beautiful medium rare with mint jelly (in a hollowed out green apple)...it was awesome. If you love lamb, but hate paying way too much for 4 measly chops, then this is the place for you. The deep brown sauce wasn't overly rich and they weren't drowning in it either. I can't stress enough how happy I was to be able to enjoy my lamb in all its natural goodness.  My partners prime rib was a perfect medium well...and the larger cut allowed for leftovers to be taken home for enjoyment in a prime rib omelet the next morning.  Dinners came with soup or salad (with tomatoes, olives, cucumber, hearts of palm, and wonderfully garlicky homemade croutons), our choice of starch, and their vegetable of the day, fresh green beans.  Rather than add on a $24 lobster tail, $19 1/2 lb King Crab legs, or $11 shrimp, we ordered the Broiled Seafood Platter to share. For $24 we got 2 sea scallops, 3 large shrimp, and a very large portion of orange roughy (which also came with soup/salad, carb, and vegetable). It was nice to see a broiled seafood offering, and not a fried one. Kudos Yukon Grille.  We finished with creme brulee. Decent sized, nice sugar crust, with raspberries and fresh whipped cream. A steal at $6. Would have been wonderful with a nice cappuccino, but never even asked if they had that. But we will be sure to ask next time.  This isn't some 5-star overpriced hoity toity celebrity steakhouse, so if paying $50+/plate for ambiance is your requirement for a good steakhouse, then skip this one. But if you are a working man (or woman) that wants a good steakhouse dinner without having to spend a day's wages on it, then come to Arizona Charlies on the East Side...you won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"Great Steak house ! Pricing isn't bad .... location is not the best but worth it .... would have given a higher rating but had a couple parties complain while i was here but the service for me was fine and i ordered the NY strip and it was good .... i will come back and next time i may give a higher rating !!"}
{"text":"My parents live close to this venue & have gone a few times in the past. I made a reservation for my dad's birthday and everything was flawless. Thank you to Earl for the top notch service.  The food was great. The price of the entree includes a side and choice of soup or salad to start, which most Vegas steakhouses do not offer, so that was a pleasant surprise for me. I was planning on spending a couple hundred dollars for four people, but it was super affordable for all we eat.  My parents enjoyed the dinner special, which included dessert. The staff was also conscious of a crab allergy my mom mentioned. I had the chicken caprese which was really great. The portion was filling.  What I loved was that my mom ordered dessert for the table to share, knowing there were no sugar free options. She passed the dessert to the rest of the table stating she has diabetes, which Earl overheard. Minutes into the rest of the table sharing the desserts that came with their dinner special, Earl returned to our table with a sugar free banana cream pie, just for mom. She said, \"I didn't know you had sugar free desserts\" and he stated they don't, but overheard her plight and ran to the buffet for a slice of sugar free pie. HOW SWEET IS THAT?! He went above and beyond, which I love. True hospitality. My mom also mentioned a waitress she liked from before, but couldn't remember her name. Earl knew who my mom was speaking of and had her stop by the table to say hello. Again, unnecessary but so appreciated. What a great experience for my family. Thanks, Earl!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  We went there for the Fathers day special.  The steaks were prepared perfect.  The crab legs weren't skimpy either. All in all, a must to try.  I saw the ribs at another table, and will try them next.  The meals were priced right.  Got to make a reservation, which is no biggie.  I'm a big foody, and love to eat.  Their buffet, cafe, and deli are also a good eat.  Thank you Don, and AZ Charlie's for a great meal and a great time."}
{"text":"Three stars is pushing it but it was New Years and everyone was so festive and kind that it redeemed the less than stellar food.   My husband and I came here on New Years Eve wanting a nice dinner at on off strip property that we could get in and out of without having to deal with crowds and drunks.  A lot to ask for in Vegas on NYE, I know.   I had been to Yukon Grille before (incidentally it was NYE about 7 or 8 years ago) and loved it so we decided to give it another go.  We made a later dinner res, 9pm, so that we could eat, relax and make it home in time to watch the midnight fireworks on the strip from our couch, in our jammies.  We're some serious party animals, huh?   We arrived a few minutes late but were seated immediately.  The ambiance at Yukon Grille is great - it's like a bona fide old school steakhouse with wood paneled walls, large booths and a dimly lit dining area.  It was clean and not crowded at all (the benefits of a late dinner at an obscure locals casino, I suppose).   Our server, Ann Marie, was knowledgeable about the menu and promptly took our order - medium ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes and a cesar salad for my husband and a petite filet with creamed spinach and shrimp gumbo soup for me.  A bread bowl was brought to the table with 2 (or was it 3?) different types of bread along with butter.  The bread looked and felt like it had been baked earlier in the day and reheated in the microwave just prior to serving (the disadvantage of a late dinner, I suppose). My husband got his salad and I received my soup very quickly.  While he enjoyed his salad, I have to think (once again) that the soup was made way earlier in the evening and just kept simmering all night.  It was virtually pureed by the time I got it.  I think had it been fresher it would have been delicious but the consistency was way off and a bit off-putting to imagine that it had probably been sitting all night.   Our entrees arrived in a timely manner and we got right down to the nitty gritty.  My filet was paired with carrots, asparagus and creamed spinach.  The steak was good.  Not great, not horrible.  Sufficient is the word that comes to mind.  It was cooked the way I wanted it but the flavor was lacking.  The bearnaise sauce saved the day as a nice flavor boost to go along with the meat.  Now the creamed spinach?  Capital D...Delicious - by far the best part of the meal.  The veggies.  Oh let's discuss the veggies.  All kidding aside - the carrots were baby carrots that I'd bet my life came straight from a bad inside the freezer and the asparagus was about half the size of a pencil and was as limp as, well, luckily I've never personally dealt with anything that limp before.  Whew!  My husbands rib eye was a but under-cooked for him but he enjoyed it. His veggies were as limp as mine and he commented that the potatoes were lumpy (which, I acquiesce some people prefer it that way but not this guy).   The service was good and our server, in particular, was great. She graciously took our picture (it was NYE, after all) and even suggested that we have one taken in front of the Christmas tree.  The only sort of odd thing was the carts that the buspeople used to clear tables and reset clean tables.  One cart sat next to our table for most of the time we were there and there were dirty plates on it.  It seemed a bit strange.   All in all, this isn't a BAD steakhouse, per se.  It's just not up to par with some of the more well known ones.  I have a feeling had we come at a more appropriate dinner hour, the food may have been better.  The service was wonderful and the restaurant itself is nice, considering it's Arizona Charlie's (no offense intended but come on - it is Boulder Hwy!).   We'll give it another go round in the future - say maybe NYE 2025?"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant with my family today. Reviews on Yelp were really good and we live nearby so we figured, why not?   Personally I enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant. It was definitely old-fashioned but it had a nice charm to it. The rolling tables that the wait staff used did not seem to fit the restaurant, were dirty, and waiters continually bumped into our table- which led to a drink being spilled. Our waitress dropped a wine glass on the floor and it broke right in front of us with some glass under our table. No apology. We practically begged for refills for our drinks which was met with attitude. (It was a busy Sunday night in the restaurant but I am always beyond polite so I was shocked with this behavior.) I don't know if the waitress I had was brand new or having a bad day but she knew next to nothing about the menu, I was never asked how I wanted my meat, what type of potato I would like, or if I wanted soup or salad (these things are all included.) I'm glad other reviewers have had better luck with the staff because our waitress was rude and inattentive.   Food arrived and the prime rib and mashed potatoes (I did not pick) were both cold. Same with my family members' food.  I love steak, which is why I can never return to this restaurant. My thought process is, if you're going to spend $$ at a restaurant, the quality of your food and the service at the restaurant should be above average at best."}
{"text":"Just to let you know because these things are important: made a trip here recently and the coconut shrimp was gone from the menu! You b@$+@&#$! However, they do offer a new bacon-wrapped option, which we didn't try because we were too busy stuffing our maws with the baked brie en croute (delish)!. Also, the plastic dressing cups have been replaced with more appropriate ceramic ones. I'd upgrade them half a star but you can't, so we'll call this a push. Bring back that coconut shrimp, please!"}
{"text":"I didn't know about this place (but I checked it out on Yelp, and also looked at the menu online, which does not have the dinner special on there, either, BTW) until my brother suggested we all come here to celebrate the December birthdays, mine and our mom's. Nice, quiet steakhouse, pretty elegant ambiance faux fireplace with the mantle nicely decorated for Christmas, dim lighting. Not many customers either (if there were, they were all older). Nice staff, very attentive, we had three servers for 15 member group (only one baby). Excellent service.  The dinner special is posted at the front entrance post (not on the menus given at the table). Three course meal $18.99, starter (soup or salad), steak diane (comes with steamed vegetables, I chose the baked potato, came with all the fixings- cheese, sour cream, butter, green onion, bacon bits), and dessert (bread pudding, ice cream, creme brulee); b-day choice (NY style cheesecake or chocolate cake---complete with lit candles and a birthday song).   Since our four parties came at different times, we started with the bread basket (pretzel bread---so yummy, but I stopped at one (I could've had more!!!), everything bread roll (hubby's fave), cranberry bread slice). Once most of our group was here, we placed our orders, appetizers were battered shrimp with cilantro chutney, mmm, (huge! it was really good) and calamari---two orders (served in fried tostada bowls, which you could eat too; very good, cooked perfectly). Our son really liked the calamari, which is a good thing, because it seems like he is getting picky these days. It didn't seem like a long wait for each course to arrive. Our servers kept checking in on us, and took plates away  pretty quickly, too.  My salad with blue cheese dressing on the size (romaine lettuce, cucumbers, olives, cherry tomatoes, shredded carrot) had blue cheese crumbles (nice but unexpected) but there were some lettuce pieces with brown edges which I just picked out. My steak (medium well) had nice grill marks, and it wasn't overly fatty, but only finished half (took home the rest). I am glad the sauce was on the side because it was very heavy (my sister didn't like it), but cream-based sauces are usually heavy and salty. The A-1 sauce made it better. My baked potato was perfect, but I only finished a quarter of it (yes, leftovers!). Steamed vegetables were skinny green string beans with diced tomatoes, I had a couple bites (noticed that most of the teens did not touch them). Hubby and I switched dessert (the NY style cheesecake is very dense), but I couldn't finish the creme brulee because I really got full from the entire meal (and I love creme brulee). And our niece gladly welcomed the ones we couldn't finish. Most of  our group got the ice cream, which were in the old-fashioned ice cream glass tall cups (generous size!!!). My mom also had leftovers because she said she ate too much bread and crackers (it's like the chips and salsa at mexican restaurants).   My brother had a comp credit of $200, a $75.00 coupon, and so, the final cost was $49.99 because he had a club card to use (more discounts), as well. Thanks Kuya! Our group had two younger ones, so in total, thirteen meals were ordered. I guess the special used to have more choices, but they recently changed it."}
{"text":"Used to be good but going down fast! Boxed mashed potato.... bland spaghetti thats not spaghetti noodles... bland everything... no thanks! Only positive is service."}
{"text":"This is quite a small steakhouse but the food is what really matters. You start off with an assortment of complimentary bread and a side of butter. The menu is the typical steakhouse fares, steak, seafood and appetizers like calamari. I've tried the filet mignon and the Asian ribs and both were cooked very well. The sides are almost the same, carrots and usually a potato cooked the way you want or typically some type of rice. I usually go with the soup and had the clam chowder and tomato soup which were what you would expect. It's kind of pricey, but the quick service and the hospitality was very poignant and delightful. I would go here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for people that live steak or sea food. I am only giving it 4 stars because of the great service and the quality of food. I am not a huge fan of meat and i do not eat sea food but came here on a family diner and every one loved their food. The waiter, Tom was his name i believe was very helpful and took care of my picky-eater requests and didnt make me feel weird about it. We spend a good $350 dollars so it is a bit pricey for 5 people but they ordered Escargot, Oysters and Lobster so it was expected. The cheesecake was also delicious! Even though its not my thing, i would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love it here. The staff is friendly and attentive. Homey feel, not stuffy.   The food is always skillfully crafted and delicious.   Decent wine selection with fair pricing.   Full bar. Tonight, Makers Manhattan.   Desserts. They look good, but I'm always too full.   Kind of old school Las Vegas with local charm."}
{"text":"Here is one of those hidden away Gems in Arizona Charlies.. We have been here a few times over the years. It is really a nice restaurant we really have enjoyed.  It is kinda of a romantic place to take a date or celebrate a nice occasion the ambiance is really nice. Not too fancy and not real expensive!!   The staff is always so friendly. The food is always so good. The steaks are the best. Always cooked perfect, I get mine rare and they always have such a nice taste.  We have never had any complaints. You will really enjoy coming here. If you over on this side of town sometime check this place out!"}
{"text":"The Yukon Grille is a classy, sort of old fashion dining experience.  The chef comes out and greets you before you are waited on, and your food is brought to you on carts as opposed to a waiter struggling with 10  burning plates in his hands.  The atmosphere is also very peaceful and quiet.  The food IMO is excellent.  The dinner salad is simple, refreshing, and not overpowering.  I highly recommend the New York steak and the ribs.  However, I have heard that the pasta dishes leave something to be desired.    Also, do not leave without getting dessert.  They do a table side bananas foster and cherries jubilee which they prepare in front of you (nice presentation and tastes delicious!), and they also have cheesecake served with a seasonal fruit and fruit sauce that has a nice, refreshing flavor.  (perfect for neutralizing the palate after a large dinner.)  -Aaron, I don't think you ate at the Yukon Grille.  They don't even have anything on the menu that is $3.49 or $7.99, nor do they serve steak with eggs.  I think you confused Yukon Grille for another restaurant inside Arizona Charlies. (The other restaurants, excluding Yukon Grille, are terrible.)    BTW, the place is only open fri - sun from 5pm-10pm."}
