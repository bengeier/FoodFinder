{"text":"wow, we are finishing our meal right now. everything was delicious! veggie omelette, tomato soup, grilled cheese, house salad, coffee, and the red sangria. one of the best meals I have had in vegas in a long time. Beautiful restaurant and the best service I have ever had in vegas. We will be back Barcelona! Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food, so many good flavorings & genourous portions. Owners are so fun to talk with. Service is attentive. Atmosphere and staff are friendly & inviting. Beautiful, cozy and very clean. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"The Paella was better than the than the paella I had in Spain last summer, the hummus and homemade chips were amazing as well. The waitress, Tee, was super friendly and helped make amazing recommendations. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"O.M.G. best food ever. I went with my husband and my two girls. I have no clue where to start. There really isnt many tapas choices in Vegas. Do not go in here and only get one thing because yoy would just be missing out. This was my first time trying one out and I was not disappointed. Barcelona Tapas just opened a week ago inside the Artisan Hotel, they have another location in southern Highlands that has excellent reviews. The ambiance if the entire place plus the restaurant is absolute perfection. To start we had the  red and white Sangria which is house made and was probably the best Ive ever had. We got theFried Goat Cheese Balls, Shrimp al Ajillo(AMAZING),  Apple Menchengo Salad, the Chicken Skewers and the Steak Skewers. I literally LOVED everything. Once we finished we then got the Beef Carpaccio, the ribeye Bites, the braised beef tacos, a second helping of Fried Goat Cheese Balls, Barcelona Fries. Thats all I can really remember lol. Everything was absolutely superb. I didnt know what a carpaccio was so I didn't finish that but it was absolutely delicious. I believe anyone that goes in knowing what that is will not be disappointed. For dessert, which i was already stuffed but had to say what the heck!, we had the Sweet empanadas, Chocolate Tres Leches cake, and the Flan. Wow, wow, wow.
I would say my stand out were particular but honestly, I cant choose. When i first saw the menu I thought it was delicious. Actually eating there exceeded my expectations so high that  everything was my favorite.
The chef, Edgar came to check on us a couple times and was friendly. I was glad because i needed to praise his outstanding menu and skills in the kitchen. The owner Gilbert was very hospitable and looked truly please with our satisfaction, lastly our server Nancy was absolutely incredible, loved her and her personality! 
This is a 10 out of 10 place. A must go for anyone that visits Vegas as well as locals looking for a place to eat. I havent been this satisfied with a restaurant in a very long time!! Definitely will be back and try even more items on the menu!!
P.S. the only reason I didnt capture any photos is because every time something came out I would be too excited and would jump right in and by the time I remembered that i needed to take one everyone had already devoured everything!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much!!! The theme and design is so cool! And my waitress Nanci was so nice and helpful. The food is also delicious"}
{"text":"Wow!  True tapas dishes that are hand crafted with the freshest of ingredients.  The whole staff - amazing!  The back house, cooking the most delicious and interesting tapas....cannot say enough good about this off-the-strip restaurant.  A must try, and thank you to Gilbert for making us feel so welcome and comfortable."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  This is a little bit of a trek off the strip but the taste and value make this place a definite winner.  My favorite was the chorizo which had amazing flavour.  The plating and atmosphere may not be so glitzy but all the food was fresh and authentic Spanish and I would definitely come back for a tasty break from the strip. Oh, and definitely try their in house barrel aged sangria!"}
{"text":"Service and food was excellent.   The Sangria is wonderful.   The owners Gilbert and Patricia are very attentive to their customers and the quality of the food.   We will go againt!"}
{"text":"Very cute tapas place in the Artisan hotel. A little off the beaten path but worth visiting! Everything we tried was delicious, especially the fried goat cheese. Laid back, friendly, and great food. This was the perfect change of pace from the overpriced strip restaurants."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has such great reviews.......If I could give zero stars I would.  We used a groupon, which brought our total to $10 and some odd change.  So, basically we paid $10 for a beer, glass of water & some ketchup as everything else was inedible.  I love food and I will practically eat anything, especially when I'm starving......which I was.  I have never had such a bad experience as I had here.  The fried calamari was waaaaaay, way over done and fried so crispy that the calamari was dried up and broke like glass when I tried to eat it with my fork, but I still ate what I could which was about 1/4 of it.  My fiance got a stuffed burger, which was stringy and undercooked........how in the hell is ground beef stringy?  It looked absolutely disgusting and I think he took about 2 bites out of it before giving up.   After \"dinner\", I was left with stomach pains most of the night......so my suggestion is if you are in the mood for tapas, look somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place is rated so well.  First, it looks like it was, or is, a brothel. The cold tapas was warm and the hot tapas was cold.  The cook broke the salt shaker and saffron into the paella before cooking it to death and then serving it cold as well. The 'wine list' was the printed price list from behind the bar and I should have stayed with water."}
{"text":"Good Bites and brew. The Sangria was good. Took friends from out of town for a pre dinner snack. Service was slow."}
{"text":"I went with my family las Friday for the first time to this restaurant and the food was great. The service was excellent and very friendly. Inclusive the owner went to our table and we had a nice conversation about the quality of the ingredients that he used in his plates. The  butter was delicious. We ordered Chicken soup, plantains, paellas and bread pudding and all was delicious and the plates very well presented. The paellas were very well prepared not dried but not too wet. The paellas were full of seafood. Also we drank the house sangria that really was amazing.
I recommend very well this place."}
{"text":"Love this place, delicious food and nice service. More than 50 Tapas (small plates) on the menu. In addition to six entrees. They serve the Traditional Spanish Paella, and a tasty Barcelona Burger."}
{"text":"Amazing food here! Love everything about this place! We tried the so many things and got great suggestions from our waiter Gilbert! He is an amazing waiter and salesman. Sangria was great food was great and service was awesome! Thanks Gilbert! We will be back as soon as we can."}
{"text":"Went in with my daughter for breakfast. Ordered the French toast with bacon and it was very good. Service was great and the restaurant is clean and well decorated. Well definitely go back to try the lunch and dinner menu."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here w/ my bf because we were craving tapas and paella. If you check-in, you can claim a free sangria -which was delicious btw, very smooth, fresh and not too sweet. I ordered the white and my boyfriend ordered the red, and they both tasted great. We ordered a couple of tapas, the stuffed artichokes (super yummy) and the potatoes. I loved them both. The paella, however, was missing some flavor, overall it was good, but I think could improve. The serving was huge however -my boyfriend and I could not finish it all and ended up taking a lot of it home for leftovers. The man who was serving us, Gilbert, was very attentive, kind, and genuinely pleasant company. The ambience is very cozy and romantic. Parking is valet only. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place to have an intimate dinner. Live music, great service and spectacular food !!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Barcelona a few times, and we love it! Clean, quick seating, and the staff is always very friendly. You get a lot of bang for your buck, too. We always eat well. Food is brought out quickly and is always hot, and we've never had bad tapas here. Some of the tapas we've tried: macaroni, couscous, mashed potatoes, fries... We typically do the all you can eat deal. And the sangria is DOPE."}
{"text":"Well what a shame first of all it does not say on their website that happy hour is not on Friday,Saturday,or Sunday .
The loud jazz music from the bar next door was competing with a loud big TV with a shitty program , why not show a video on Spain I wonder.
For the food ,tacos way ,way to spicy with tough meat , wife's salad stated it had orange and artichoke hearts alas not this time ,croquettes were ok ,tortilla Espanyol pretty good, empanadas so-so came with a green small salad without any dressing. Come on chef surly you can do better.
Mistakes in bill overcharged was corrected , service mediocre at best.
All told will not go back so sorry."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but didn't have a strong Spanish feel.  The biggest disappointment was the Serrano Ham Platter, which is supposed to come with Manchego cheese.  What arrived was instead a block of white cheddar cheese.  And the Serrano ham was pretty much prosciutto from the local market.  When we complained that it wasn't Manchego, the waiter communicated back from the kitchen that it is Manchego.  It clearly wasn't Manchego and it bothered me that they lied about it.  It kind of ruined my taste buds for the rest of the meal.  We also ordered the Veggie Empanadas which was decent, patatas braves which were ok, but not worth the $7.99 price, shrimp al ajillo which was good, and fried goat cheese which was also good.  Had the cheese been real Manchego I would have given a higher rating of 3-4 stars, but because the kitchen lied, I had to give a worse rating.  

The restaurant is hidden in the Artisan Hotel and was completely empty when we ate there.  It was a bit spooky because of how empty and quiet the restaurant was for a Saturday night.  Our server was extremely nice and accommodating making the meal somewhat pleasurable."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Not even from the area but came here based on the yelp reviews. All were correct. I came here on a Tuesday and went with the all you can eat at the bar. I tried almost everything and all of it was off the charts!  This is now my must visit every time I'm here!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the service. The guy was working alone and beyond awesome. The food wasn't spectacular, it was just okay"}
{"text":"Little hard to find but worth the trip.  Food presentation and flavors were quite good."}
{"text":"First, let's talk about sangria.  They make theirs by the barrel and it is amazing. For food we tried several things, Mac & cheese, mushrooms and the surf & turf. All delicious. The service was excellent and they even had a live mariachi band.  I will definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I came reluctantly because my husband wanted to try it out. It was worth my fuss. I had the surf and turf which was delicious however I wish I would've gotten the seafood casserole! My husband got that one. We will come back for another visit. Our waitress was Tee was very good . Amazing food and service can't beat that combo!"}
{"text":"Ambiance on point. Flavor to back it. And service catered to us. We had a great time here and will surely be back soon. This is a must try off the main strip but not far. Unique little hotel it's attached to also."}
{"text":"We were a little nervous when we walked in at 7:00 to an empty dining room, but we didn't need to be. We ordered 8 different tapas and they were all great. Highlights were the filet medallions, stuffed jalapeños, and couscous."}
{"text":"A mouthfull of flavors. We did the all you can eat tapas with a pitcher of sangria. Its was great! Only rule is - both had to do the all you can eat and anything not listed in menu was full price.  But totally worth it.  
We visit Cafe Sevilla in San Diego and only thing missing is the music."}
{"text":"This was a super yummy place. The shrimp were all cooked perfectly, in the paella and in the garlic butter sauce. The lamb chops were super tender and also perfectly cooked. I loved the sauces on everything. Beef carpaccio was perfect too. Reasonable prices as well. Sangria was delicious--red was slightly better than white, but both good. Be careful though as they are potent. Service was also excellent--very attentive and incredibly friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good and healthy Spanish food.
Cool coffee here!
Amazing service and great place to go with family and friends.)))"}
{"text":"The food is disgusting, they have have no idea what spanish food is all about.  The manger owner has never been to Spain and he claims to know what spanish food should taste like.  Do not come here go to firefly is you want spanish food."}
{"text":"The food is great and the spicy calamari soup was delicious but only three stars because can't count on it being open during posted open hours.  You may encounter notes on the door saying sorry open again at a later time."}
{"text":"We found this great little spot on Yelp, and we couldn't have been happier!  We took our two kids to introduce them to tapas, and we tried about ten different plates.  I highly recommend the empanadas, the fish tacos, the tacos al pastor, the apple salad, and the bread pudding.  The staff and service were terrific--so nice and helpful with recommendations.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was fresh and delicious, and the sangria was superb. Service was good and I like being off the strip. The Artisan is a funky cool place and it's always nice to find a different vibe in town."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! I love me some tapas and Barcelona totally delivers on not only the food but also the service. I've eaten here a few times now and every single time I come I leave happy and full. It's so hard to find good paella here in Vegas. Usually it's the lack of real saffron that's missing in the dish or the seafood is whack. Not the case here. Real saffron to give it that rich color and savory flavor, and a true mixture of seafood; clams, mussels, squid, shrimp, scallops oh my! Another great seafood dish is the shrimp ceviche which is made a little different than your common Mexican ceviche, such great flavor! Not to take anything away from the focus of the dish, but the chips are remarkable. Freshly made in-house. For me, even if the ceviche is good, bad chips can ruin the whole dish. Barcelona delivers on both. 
During another one of my visits I had the garlic pork sandwich which is a house favorite. I could tell why. You can taste the garlic flavor, which isn't over-powering, but enough to give the pork that extra flavor. The coolest thing of all though is the coleslaw they add on top of the sandwich. The sweet and cool flavor of the coleslaw balances out the pork very nicely. 
Last but certainly not least, the service. Tee has been my server each time I've visited. Her customer service is superior and she truly provides a memorable dinning experience. It's her attention to detail that creates the experience. You have a customer for life."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the experience. Knowledgeable staff. Greta vibe and atmosphere. Live music was a plus."}
{"text":"Food was good. Went at lunch time and had the sliders and Cuban sandwich. Our server, Gilbert, was very personable and attentive. Will definitely go back again. The valet was also very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Must visit!!! Unique hotel off the beaten path. This restaurant inside the Artesan Boutique is very ultra hip, trendy yet the food is spectacular. We had their signature paella, dates wrapped in delicious bacon and tropical sangria. Menu has tons of Spanish style tapas along with hearty dishes.  I can't say enough about the service.   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out on International Tapas Day, and was afraid they were going to be packed but we had almost the entire restaurant to ourselves. The food was wonderful, especially the bacon wrapped dates and fried goat cheese. The waitress was wonderful at her job and suggested we try the skewered beef which was well-cooked but a bit boring. Only missing one star because people kept stumbling in and out from the pool party nearby... nothing the restaurant can control, but something to be aware of when you're searching for ambiance."}
{"text":"Wow what a hidden gem. I could not be more satisfied with everything. The vibe was a so chill. Amazing decor. Very artsy. My wife and I had the beef carpaccio, bruschetta, shrimp al ajillo....and for the gran finale we had the fried goat cheese. OMG. I could have eaten so much more but all tapas have generous portions. Service was stellar. . The prices are very reasonable. We will definitely be frequenting this establishment more often! Thank you to everyone at Barcelona! Perfect for an intimate night out, or for large groups. If you haven't been there you must give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place was good, but I wouldn't go in expecting authentic Barcelonan cuisine. 

First off, the decor is...weird. The restaurant is in a \"boutique\" hotel, and well--you'll see when you enter the lobby that this is not your typical hotel. I thought it was weird and off putting, but you might find it interesting. 

Second, the food was good. I got the pork taco lunch special. The tacos were pretty good although there was way too much meat for the tiny tortillas. The rice and beans were okay, but they were definitely not fresh and were kind of mushy. 

My mom got the gazpacho, and that was kind of disappointment because they blended the tomatoes, cucumbers, and oil all together into this consistency that reminded me of apple sauce. The soup was orange! As someone who went to Barcelona for a week and tried probably 20 gazpachos there, I never encountered a gazpacho like the one this restaurant serves. The color and consistency was definitely a turn off. 

Finally, the service was okay. The waiter seemed happy to see us, especially since we were the only party there for a good 45 minutes. However, the food came out a bit slow."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.
An amazing local spot, with a great atmosphere.
Live music on the weekeneds and the food is always incredible. 
Definitely get the \"Barcelona\" feeling while you're here.

The wait staff is great and very attentive. 
All dressed up or casual, Barcelona is always a great idea."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and prices! Will definitely be back. Our server (Teeraporn) made us feel so welcome and made for a great ending for our girls weekend vacation!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite ways to eat. One little plate at a time. It n9t only allows you to control your portion sizes, but you aren't commiting to a plate of food you may not like. They serve breakfast now and it's a great happy hour menu."}
{"text":"omg the service and food is amazing! i would highly recommend. next time in vegas, definitely will come back."}
{"text":"--Rant---

I tried multiple things but for some reason the spaghetti and meatballs really stuck out to me. hahahaah yeah right? Of all the things...probably because the meatballs are some spanish seasoned version and the tomato sauce has wine in it? Don't know for sure but damn it tasted gooooood.

I tried several of the small dishes; the (regular) sliders, veggie/chicken/beef empanadas, both hamburgers (they have a classic and a Spanish version?)...yeah over two weekends I tried a TON of food. Blew close to 4 bills total? Yeah obviously I would go back for more.

The only criticisms:

1. Some items were not as rich in flavor as I would have expected/hoped.  For instance when I compared one of the shrimp dishes (I think in a garlic sauce) with say the chicken empanadas, the latter was noticeably not as seasoned or flavorful as the prior dish...it's almost like they went over to Trader Joes (does Vegas even have one? fuck it...say Smith's or some shit instead), bought some frozen empanadas, nuked them and served them to you. Not that they tasted bad...they just didn't stand out as anything exciting. Needless to say I only ordered the chicken empanadas once. And note that I gave this whole empanada thing more than one go (3 goes actually), and none of them really stood out w.r.t. flavor.

2. I ordered one of the soups and it was lukewarm at best. Nuke the soup next time...I like my soup HOT...HOT like your wife lol...like about to burn my tongue off hot~

Awesome restaurant, worth visiting, great menu with tons of options. You gotta walk through a CREEPY AS FUCK SWINGERS HOTEL on the shit side of the strip to get to it (not downtown but more so next to Palace Station...yeah *THAT* shit side) but the food and service make it worth your while. That and there are dispensaries within walking distance~ #WEED

---Overall---

Service: A+. Friendly and attentive~

Food: B. Could have been more flavorful, hotter, etc.

Atmosphere: A+. Way brighter than the rest of the hotel

Value: A-. I made multiple trips...'nuff said~"}
{"text":"This is a cozy, private spot for a stellar lunch or dinner. I can't believe the beauty of the decor! It's right inside the Artisan Hotel. Our server, Gilbert, was excellent and very personable. We enjoyed our experience and will pop back in for a great meal very soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food . Very fresh. Great service. I went with a friend and both of us love the food. Great place. All the food we taste was excellent and delicious. Gilberto, the waiter, was very helpful . We love the fact he is Colombian., like us. I went with a very special friend and definitely will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Started off my friends Bachelorette Party here for dinner. Co-owner Gilbert was so awesome. He made our experience there so much fun and the food was amazing. The sangria was so good we had two pitchers of it. I will be definitely be going back and recommending it to my friends as well"}
{"text":"Went during midweek happy hour. Despite good live music, the bar was less than happy. Bartender says the crowds come out mostly on weekends.  Happy hour food was tasty and there was no shortage of selection.  I'm a fan of spicy aioli but they squirted it generously on 3 of the 4 dishes we ordered.  The carpaccio was excellent and came with a side of roasted chili-type sauce that would've stood fine by itself without the aioli."}
{"text":"The chef was so nice! I had the most humblest experience when my family and I walked into the restaurant. The food was the best! It was the last night of the restaurant at the Blue Diamond Location. The paella and sangria was delicious! I can't wait to plan a trip to Spain!"}
{"text":"Great food,great service (Amber from Buford) tapas were incredible.  Neat atmosphere and fab food, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Weird f***k*n place. GREAT FOOD! Tee is an amazing server! Food was fast, amazing recommendations from the server on tapas to try. We ordered bacon wrapped dates, sauteed mushrooms, ceviche, bacon wrapped jalapenos, shrimp a la diabla, bread pudding sangria!!! YUMMMM"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! My wife and me went there for lunch on our anniversary, the food and service was so good that we went back for dinner."}
{"text":"I stayed in the hotel. The man I spoke to, which I believe was the owner, was very rude when I called. He assured me they closed at 10pm. I waited until 9:30 to go down and he was closed! He could have told me they close early occasionally and I would have came right down, but he was too rude and abrupt to do so."}
{"text":"It was super tasty. I created a yelp account just to give them a review. We had great Tapas and the chef came out to chat with us about our food then gave some recommendations which was delicious. Service was excellent and everyone catered to our needs.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Our group of 5 did not hold back, we ordered almost every tapas on the menu, along with the white and red sangria. The fried goat cheese is sooooo good.  Everything was fast and delicious. Plus it's adults only, so no kids and beautiful art everywhere."}
{"text":"Luv the paella , the tapas were also amazing , we had the fried goat cheese balls , bacon wrapped dates and the Chorizo de Bilbao . We  split all four of the dessert menu choices like the bananas fosters , the flan , something chocolate and the bread pudding . Amaaaaaaaazing , we will be  back soon  ! Oh and the Sangria was scrumptious . This place is a gem  and if you want a place that you can have conversations on a  busy Friday night this is it . The host owner Gilbert Bonilla is very charming and attentive    . service was excellent ."}
{"text":"The food was ok.... the service was VERY slow and it wasn't even a full house.  The waitress forgot part of my order until we mentioned one of the tapas I ordered.....  We were greeted by a homeless man at the valet, he was nice but not what I was expected. The saving grace for this place was they had live music from Julio and Cesar. They were absolutely fantastic!!! However during the night another performer who was playing the drums at the lounge interrupted the band in the restaurant!  :("}
{"text":"In the afternoon on a Saturday, they are pretty slow. So for me, that is the time to go! The restaurant is right off of the bar area and when we went it didn't have a maître d' stand. So we kind of had to stand around waiting for someone to come talk to us

The bacon wrapped dates are pretty good. But the prices are a little high for tapas plates. 

What this restaurant has going for them is their location. The Artisan is such a cool hotel. If this restaurant was in a strip mall, I might probably never go back."}
{"text":"Sauted mushrooms and patatas tapas were amazing. Great happy hour deals and very good service"}
{"text":"What a great find right off the strip.  The restaurant was beautifully decorated and quiet.  We were greeted by Amber, she was spectacular!  She gave suggestions of great food and activities in the area.  The food came out quickly and was all delicious.   The next time we are in town we will come here again, especially if Amber is working."}
{"text":"This place is great!! The food is even better than I could've ever imagined. It seems we ordered almost one of everything and it was all delicious. The chef even came out to meet us. My favorite items were the rib eye bites, filet mignon, Parmesan baskets and the goat cheese bites. But you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem in the Las Vagus! The best tapas I've ever had! The service was so great, and did help me a lot for making choices!"}
{"text":"Been twice now! The white sangria and seafood pallela are delicious!!! Love the secure and atmosphere very cozy. Great date place."}
{"text":"I just visited for the 1st time. This Latin resturant completely exceeded my expectations. The restaurant itself is very chic & clean & all the food was made fresh. I'm all about fresh food. I try to avoid restaurants that serve frozen food! So if your looking for fresh & delicious with a Latin twist, this is the spot to go to. Also, the manager Gilbert was amazing. Introduced himself to our table & was so friendly. Talk about great customer service. I will definitely be coming back & recommending this resturant to friends & family."}
{"text":"The most horrible experience EVER!

I made a reservation on open table to dine here for lunch after seeing the good yelp reviews and it was a total disappointing experience and I would never ever ever come back here again. Especially after I called the restaurant manager and he did nothing to try to remedy the situation.

We arrived at the restaurant to be told that one of the rooms was taken out by a private event, no problems, I was told that we could still dine by the bar. So we sat down by the bar and the whole place was empty, which is never a good sign. Our bartender told us that he couldn't order food for us because the restaurant and the bar are two separate things. Super weird! He had to actually pick up the phone and call the server to come take our order, and the server didn't come for a good 10 minutes.  She finally came and took our order, very briefly and didn't really explain the menu to us. 

We never saw her again, 45 minutes later, we still didn't get our food so we had to get the bartender to literally phone call her again to come and bring our food. The food actually also didn't taste good! For the Price we were charged which was strip prices, the portions were very tiny, presentation was very lacking and so was the taste.

We contemplated ordering more food, because we were still hungry, but we ended up not ordering anymore because we didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for food. Then we asked for a bill, only to be told that the drinks and food had to be paid on a separate bills. What a pain!! The bartender and then phone called the server again and for another 20 minutes she never came to pick up our bill. We had to literally walk back into the kitchen to chase her down. Oh and we never got any drinks from her either.

I also asked to speak to the manager, and no one came. Later in the day I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, and he didn't do anything to remedy the situation. 

Terrible customer service! Food sucks and very pricey! Avoid!!"}
{"text":"My wife found this placebo yelp. It's only been open a few weeks. We took a cab from our strip hotel to this restaurant which is in another hotel off the strip. We were disappointed that happy hour didn't include the weekends. We ordered meatballs and the paella. I live in a Basque city and I was impressed with the amount of seafood in the dish. Big shrimp, mussels and lots of other stuff. My wife and I finished it all!! We were lucky to meet the owner who was nice enough to come to our table and talk with us for quite some time. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Barcelona is  a hidden gem in the city of Las Vegas. Last night my boyfriend and I enjoyed an incredible experience for their happy hour. Not only was the food incredible but it was made with love. Each dish is made fresh to order and you can taste the creative care in each dish. The happy hour prices are great and the sangria is made in wine barrels which creates an incredible smooth taste and easy to want to have multiple! Trust me, you will want multiple! 

We met the owner Gilbert who owns the restaurant with his wife and he was lovely and helpful in choosing the dishes. 

We had the beef empanadas- SO GREAT. Fresh, and the aioli to dip them in is on point. 

The sangria was one of our favorites! Top quality and you can tell that there was a lot of time put in to create them. 

The mac and cheese was so yummy! The fresh menchego cheese was so great topped with fresh bacon. 

We also go the stuffed artichokes. So great! The sauce on the artichokes you can tell was homemade. 

We ended with their cappuccino and tres leche chocolate cake. They make their dessert in house it was really yummy but next time we want to try to empanadas dessert. Their coffee tastes quality also. I didn't catch the brand of coffee they use.

Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident -- flipping through a Vegas tourism book. We like tapas, so we decided to give it a shot. Glad we did! We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, surf and turf, potatoes, steak and mashed potatoes, and a salad. We had more than enough food for three people and everything was delicious. The steak was tender and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Barcelona Tapas is located inside the Artisan Hotel.  If you do decide to come here there is no public parking, it is valet only.  This place wasn't terrible but I wasn't wowed either.  Service was nice enough.  We came in around 11:30 am and besides one other patron, we were the only ones there the entire time we ate.  Our group was a party of three and we ordered 6 tapas (small plates) and still left feeling hungry. 

We ordered:
-White Sangria (free with Yelp check in) - Really light and refreshing. Compared to other sangrias I've had not much fruit mixed in with the drink though.
-Tacos al pastor ($6.99) - Smaller street tacos style, the pork was seasoned really well and the sauce on top had a nice kick to it.  The pork was a tad dry. 
-Pan Fried Dates ($6.99) - Bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese, tasty and one of my favorite dishes out of the bunch we ordered.
-Patatas Bravas ($7.99) - Potatoes with aioli sauce on top, we found this dish extremely salty.
-Barcelona Salad ($10.99) - Light salad with a light dressing, nothing terrible, nothing memorable.
-Surf & Turf ($13.99) - Bacon wrapped filet mignon and shrimp on top of mashed potatoes.  Tasty but the dish came with a small amount of filet mignon and only one or two shrimp.
-Zarzuela de Mariscos ($23.99) - Seafood dish with shrimp, calamari, mussels, clams, some type of fish, and rice drizzled in a sauce.  Out of all the dishes we enjoyed this the most and the sauce wasn't too heavy either. 

Overall, I don't see myself coming back here.  If you do decide to come here I would recommend not to come here with a massive appetite.  This place is probably better suited if you're only going to get drinks and a dish or two to snack on."}
{"text":"When I first arrived at the restaurant with my girlfriend I was impressed with the ambience it provided. It helped to set a romantic mood for us. Unfortunately, when I arrived I wasn't too hungry, so I only ordered the Barcelona Salad. What a huge mistake! The salad was so good, with immense flavors of which I've never had in salad. Fortunately, my Beautiful Girlfriend ordered fish tacos so I \"helped\" her finish her fish tacos! Which were also packed full with flavor!
If we weren't pressed for time I would've definitely ordered more food. And I wasn't even hungry! Barcelona Tapas will be one of my frequent stops every time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious! All the food we got tasted amazing. I would recommend getting the paella, croquetas and the spanish tortilla.
It is a tad pricey since the dishes aren't that big but the food is definitely worth it, it is packed with flavor! They do have a happy hour around 4pm on weekdays I believe.
Service was also amazing, the waiter seemed to be by himself but the place wasn't packed and he was constantly checking on us and making small talk, super friendly!
The restaurant is located inside the Artisan hotel, and it is beautiful inside. Decorated with eccentric art all around the walls and ceiling, bookshelves and other cool furniture; the restaurant itself is very nicely decorated. 
I highly recommend this place! I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Service was great but food was not the best compared to authentic tapas from Spain and or Miami where are from.  Best thing we tried were dates"}
{"text":"This was my first time here coming from L.A for my boyfriend birthday... the hostess Amber welcomed us with a warm smile since the beginning, made us feel comfortable. Service is great!!! And the food is amazing... we ordered the croquettes, mussels and steak bites. Everything was amazing!! I really recommend the house sangria... best sangria!!!"}
{"text":"This is our second time having dinner here. We came back because the Sangria was the best we 've had here in Las Vegas. To our disappointment it was very different this time. I fear that this place is on the brink od going down hill. There is never anyone in this restaurant. Im talking 
empty. We were the only ones dining and it was awkward. I thought it was just a fluke the first we were there, but now again? 
Secondly while the service was good and the food good, they turned off the music during dinner. We really felt uncomfortable. Maybe they were trying to tell us something.
 My review is based on the difference in quality of the sangria and overall atmosphere in just a few short weeks. Leave it to Vegas to go from zero to zero in record time, only the rich survive.  
Im going back to Firefly... the sangria is good and atmosphere is festive. At least I don't feel isolated there and the crowd, the service and the food is GREAT!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place last night. The food is very good. We ordered the croquettes, paella, shrimp ceviche and baked jalapeños. The staff was friendly. I would definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Super tasty tapas! Creative plates. Delicious!

My server Nikki was well informed on all the dishes and I pretty much just followed her suggestions."}
{"text":"This is our third visit to this restaurant. The tapas are amazing and they have the best Sangria in town! The service is great and we will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"First off, little tricky to find didn't realize it was in the Artisan! Once we got in though, very nice! The decor is cool in the hotel and in the restaurant, kinda cozy atmosphere not huge. 
Menu is pretty big, lots of interesting choices. All the food was great! Especially the sliders, made a twist on it that was great! Calamari needed a little more salt, and the aioli was kinda bland, but the food was great with out it!

Service was 5 star, Gilbert was perfect! Friendly, prompt, engaging! Really helped top it all off.
For only being open 4 weeks, everything was smooth and A+++"}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmmmmm I really wanted this place to be great. Sooo let's start by highlighting the great things! 

1. Customer Service is awesome!! The waiters and the entire staff are really sweet and very attentive. 

2. Pork empanadas are amazeballs!! Soft, flaky, and flavourful! Everything you need from a great empanadas is served in this fantastic pastry.

3. The decor is very interesting and really is a conversation starter. BRAVA!!

4. The sangrias are really tasty and very authentic.

5. The menu really provides a lot of options! At a tapas place its important to have many options to tantalize your client's palates............

Which brings us to what went wrong. 

You can mess up anywhere......except for the food. And that's why such the low score. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and that was burnt. The croquettes were undercooked and the mushrooms weren't cooked all the way through. The kitchen was pretty lazy. 

And by itself that's pretty bad. But it doesn't stop there! *sigh* Upon walking up the attendant was mopping the floor and there were cleaning products everywhere. It took them a while before we were acknowledged. They hadn't even turned on the lights which troubled me because how exactly were they cleaning? Then also there was lots of construction everywhere in the bar which made me somewhat concerned about the safety of those elements surrounding our food.

So all in all this place has tons of potential but hasn't made the mark quite yet. Looking forward to seeing it after some time to see if it's improved."}
{"text":"Lets start with a wow. Love the atmosphere of the restaurant, and the decor is just beautiful! I stopped by to celebrate a friend's birthday and it was fantastic. We order the rib-eye bites,corquettes,baked-jalapenos,fried goat cheese,pan-fried dates,fried camalri. The waitress recommend us to try the Mixed Pallela as are last dish before ordering our dessert. The mixed pallela was sooo delicious!! We did order the banana foster as our dessert.   The food was just so delicious and the service is just amazing!! This is my favorite restaurant and will be returning back for the yummy food and great service that they provide!"}
{"text":"Been in vegas 12 years and never been inside the Artisan hotel. We had dinner here at the Barcelona Restaurant. I will be back again. Nothing in vegas looks like this hotel and restaurant. Food was excellent as well as the service. The sangria was one of he best I've ever had. Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Really good Tapas and a nice environment. The food taste great and wasn't to far from the strip. The Tapas were nicely priced on average from $5 - $10."}
{"text":"Meal was just ok.  The hummus tasted like refrained beans, but the Burger was ok."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. We came on a weekend night-- the dining room was dead. It was oddly quiet and eerie. The server was friendly, but then he disappeared. We waited almost 20 mins to get our check. Not cool. Probably won't ever come back-- there are so many tapas places in this city, life's too short to be waiting around for 20 mins to get a check."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was excellent. Sangria tasted very authentic. Would def recommend."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday night, and we had called in ahead for a reservation. Good thinking on our part because it was packed. They told us to valet and to let them know we were going to the restuarant...no one was working valet (hotel's fault). 
The hotel had some insane pool party at the same time. By insane, I mean it was so fucking loud you couldn't even hear yourself think without screaming it out of a loud speaker. 
The staff kept apologizing...I don't even think they knew there was a hip hop party that was to take place that night. It was so loud from the bar right outside the restaurant. 

My only complaint is that they were clearly understaffed. it took a good 2 hours just to eat. Our waitress was super nice and attentive as much as she could have been. 

The dishes. They were awesome. This is the best tapas I've had in town. 
Our favs:

Beef Carpaccio 
Surf & Turf - wow. This dish was amazing. 
Pan Fried Dates

Everything we had was awesome. We had a lot more, but those three really stood out. We wanted the paella, but we'll come back another time. 

One thing they could improve: the alcohol selection. They have a very \"merh\" selection. 

They did have live music while we were there, which was excellent. Once the club music stopped, that is.

I definitely want to go back soon to try more dishes. This place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my top 3 go to spots there sliders are amazing always on point also there chicken rice soup is amazing as well! The service is A1 I recommend for anyone to try this spot out it won't disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Tapas?! I have been to many Tapas restaurants, this one does not apply. The place was empty... should have been our first red flag. The atmosphere was not bad but had a slight BO smell initially. Liked the deco. We ordered the carpaccio... omg! We really could not tell if what was on the plate was real meat... I was more like a brown spread with a fanciful drizzle of chipotle mayo... which was also on the other dishes we had. We were super shocked at the steamed clams. The clams were served in an overpowering red sauce... 3 out of 9 clams did not open. Gross! The sangria reminded me of punch with seven up. Awful."}
{"text":"This was our second time, and as the first, the food was excellent. My family insisted I try the Parmesan Baskets. I never eat pasta, but they were a comfort food dream and some of the best pasta I've ever had. The sauce was wonderful. The server said they make all their own sauces. The rare steak on the Surf and Turf was done to perfection. The Pan Fried Dates are always a must and never disappoint. My family and I have loved and been frequent patrons of another well known Tapas restaurant in Las Vegas, but since the Barcelona opened we think it's  better food at a better value. We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is totally legit!!!
The food is amazing and the service is great!!! The ambiance is amazing! You must try it!"}
{"text":"I love it tapas style and this place got it all, the ambience is nice with great music. The service it was spectacular I was helped by Gracie she it was very knowledgeable about the menu. Also the chef make sure to stop by at my table to check in us. They have the best Sangria in Vegas. The food is is delicious I'm definitely going back. Overall good experience :)"}
{"text":"We had a great meal for sure !! The restauran is decorated very sexy black and white. The staff is great :)."}
{"text":"Oh me oh my. This review is of The Barcelona, the restaurant attached to The Artisan. This place is funky and cool and the bar is super fun BUT the private dining room is cheap and tacky. Like a back room that they stuck a table in and installed a dimmer to the fluorescent light. Seriously. I was so sad when we showed up. I immediately turned the dimmer down as low as it could get. Maybe we should have turned it off and asked for candles.

The food was meh. The ribeye tasted great and the mashed potatoes were yummy but soggy frozen vegetable medley out of a bag?! Really? Are we that far off the strip that people are so drunk or high they don't taste things? Maybe so. Fortunately the company of our dinner party was so fun, we would have had a blast at Denny's but I was really sad that I spent so much $$ on such a pathetic venue. I think my guests didn't really notice and everyone had a good time but this is what you get when you organize an event from afar (we're from California). 

However, the bar is so so so funky. Mirrors on the ceiling. Crazy art everywhere. Boobies! I would definitely recommend coming back for the after-hours shenanigans. I have a feeling it gets crazy.  Why can't they just extrapolate some of that atmosphere into the restaurant? I wish they'd hire me as a designer. It has a TON of potential. It's a shame they are wasting it."}
{"text":"On our way back from Utah, I looked for a pet friendly restaurant in Vegas, enabaling both outdoor sitting and dogs allowed options, but that wasn't true! Eventhough the waitresses and the chef were trying to be helpful when they saw the error on Yelp after sitting us at the table, the patio they sent us to afterwards, was under construction and there was no place to sit and eat. Long day drives and misinformation on Yelp can be very frustrating."}
{"text":"I found this place via Groupon. I'm glad I gave it a try vs that \"other\" tapas place. I'll start out with the atmosphere. ...  very kook, kitschy & relaxed. The staff was great, the service was wonderful and the food was simply phenomenal! We started with the white sangria pitcher (cheaper than the 4 glasses we drank together). Then had chicken skewers, the stuffed dates, beef empanadas and Parmesan basket. For our next round we got the beef sliders and piquilo peppers.  While we wanted dessert, we simply had no room left. This is definitely a hidden gem inside the Artisan hotel on Western. Step outside the norm and give this place a try...,you will definitely want to come back again, as do we."}
{"text":"A few things:
-Located inside of The Artisan Hotel 
-Parking here is kind of tough so its either valet or street parking
-Make sure you do the Yelp check-in for a free sangria. 
-The empanadas and pork tacos stood out for me. Highly recommend
-Service was great. Staff was polite"}
{"text":"Interesting tapas at reasonable prices.  Gr8 ambiance and service,  Entrees are ok but I did not try the paella.  Bananas foster was watery.  Full bar and in the always kinky Artisan Hotel,  Posters are gr8 2."}
{"text":"Came here because of a Groupon. Food was awesome but unfortunately it was spoiled by the service. I don't know if it was because there was just one server or what the case was, but it really killed a night out with friends. I ordered a coffee and only received it when I asked another employee  for it when she dropped off our food (about 25 mins). I would have asked our server but he never came back to the table. Waters were refilled once. I'm assuming friends of his came in because he stayed more at their table than the other 4 tables he had combined. For the prices I paid I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"Ok, so I walked in and there was one couple eating, and no one else around. That concerned me.

Luckily I stuck around because the food is quite good. Two dishes: the shrimp diabla and the fried goat cheese. Diabla was spicy but not overpowering, we'll balanced and complex. Fried goat cheese was delightful.

So in short, I loved it."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Southern Highlands location but did not have a good experience at this location for a handful of reasons. We asked if they offered an all you can eat menu like the other location and the server told us they don't... reason she gave was that this location doesn't cater to locals like the other and they focus on serving the dishes at a higher quality.... this seemed like a shitty thing to say considering we were all locals and it's also shit talking your very own business.  Me and a friend were contemplating the white sangria and the server offered to bring us out a sample... seemed like a lovely gesture but we were brought a warm sample in a half inch tall disposable shot glass.  This probably wouldn't have been so annoying if it didn't follow the server's speech about how they provide higher quality here for non-locals. Also, we had three dishes not come out at all and when we asked the server she said they were out of those items... would have been nice to know that earlier into the meal so that we could have ordered some alternatives.  The setting of this restaurant is really cool and the dishes are really good, but the Southern Highlands location provides just as good quality and MUCH better service."}
{"text":"Great place to come get really good Paella, and the staff is super nice, we've been here 3 times already and we always leave happy."}
{"text":"Teeraporn was one of the best waitresses I've ever had. She was so sweet and so honest, with great suggestions. All the food was amazing and at a very reasonable price! Would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Good service but the food is not that good croketas are disgusting greasy the sliders  o cheese  empanadas ok...
Well the only option for food at the artisan and the pool we may try the sangria good deal on happy hour ..
Pool side is a bonus"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this tapas restaurant for a long time. Well worth the wait! Every single item we ordered tasted great!!! Definitely coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The sangria was my best ever. The hotel needs to improve the parking."}
{"text":"This location pales in comparison to the original in Southern Highlands: in presentation, flavor, quality, and nearly every other distinguishing factor. We ordered the albondigas, piquillo peppers, pan fried dates, stuffed baked mushrooms, and salami banderas, all part of our usual favorites rotation for Barcelona Tapas. The best way I can describe it is that the kitchen seemed really lazy -- thrown together dishes, ingredients missing, sliced cheese thrown on top. As a big fan of Barcelona Tapas, I was sorely disappointed. Would have possibly 3 stars if rated in a vacuum (really, 2.5), but knowing that the original location is so much better than this, nope. The service, at least, was very friendly!"}
{"text":"The sangria deserve a 5 star and the food the service was fantastic, the restaurant is inside the artisan and the hotel was remodeling the bar area and it was confusing to me, it was my first visit.  I will update once I come again, want to try the paella l."}
