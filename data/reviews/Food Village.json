{"text":"Our first experience was very disappointing.  We were missing a number of items from a combo dinner (salad, 2 kabobs, chutney, etc.), the samosas were cold and our chicken biryani had two pieces of chicken, one of which was literally a bone with no meat on it.  We called back and the manager (owner?) offered to repeat the meal for free next time.  We ordered again and were told by the same manager we'd have to pay for the extras we bought that were not included in the combo meal (naan and samosas) and delivery.  Even though he told us he'd repeat the order, it was only $3 for the food plus delivery.  The meal was much better this time, but we were still missing chutney and the samosas (which were one of the things we actually paid for).  

I would have given a lower rating, but the manager tried to make things right and the food is quite tasty.  It's just too bad that they can't seem to get their act together when sending meals out."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Chicken bryianai is the best and butter chicken. Service can be a little better but better then most Indian restaurant. Family combo four best value!"}
{"text":"Really good food, and generally a good value. I like the veg biryani and mixed vegetable curry, a good meal for around $10, and I always get two meals out of it."}
{"text":"We ordered online and picked up our order.  Quick pickup and easy ordering through Just-Eat.ca

The food was OK. Nothing amazing.  The Chana masala had a good flavour but was greasy.  The lamb biryana was alright.  Chicken Jalfrezi was decent... although had bones in it which we weren't expecting. The beef tikka wasn't very good - SO dried out.  The garlic naan was delicious.  We may try it again but stick to the vegetarian options as the meat wasn't great.  Disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's a small place, nothing fancy, service is slow but friendly.

But if you're looking for great Indian food in the Oshawa/Whitby area this is by far the best curry around.  

Some places you go to just have food colouring and generic flavours.  Food Village offers a wide variety of choices, big menu, good size portions and nice depth of flavour.  The naan was excellent... big, fluffy and crispy.  I particularly loved the garlic naan!"}
