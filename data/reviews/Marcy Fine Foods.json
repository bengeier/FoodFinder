{"text":"The worst \"Chicken Caldereta\" in town. We ocassionally buy their beef or lamb caldereta  a Filipino delicacy of meat with sauce eaten together with rice. On our last trip the owner recommended their Chicken caldereta saying it was the best of all. It is the worst Caldereta I ever tasted ! It was supposed to be mainly chicken with garnishings of potatoes and carrots. Allow me to be sarcastic but it turned out to be \"Potatoe and Carrot Caldereta\" The chicken which was supposed to be the main ingredient but it was nowhere to be found. We were so disappointed after we ate it at home because the ratio of potatoes and carrots (these being more than the chicken) to chicken was 10 to 1. Totally the other way around. We will never buy this again and we will never recommend this to our Filipino friends. A total rip off !"}
{"text":"I'm a Filipino in town more frequently lately on business from the midwest USA where we don't have any Filipino restaurants. So when I'm in Toronto I try a new Filipino restaurant for dinner every night - there are that many to choose from!  I really enjoyed the dishes I ordered. This is a carry out only restaurant. I had bistek, pork BBQ and shanghai. Each dish was familiar and delicious. The owner/chef introduced himself to me and when he found out I was visiting from out of town he proceeded to load me up with freebies.   He threw in a veg eggroll, turon, okoi and a siopao! I had them the next day for breakfast and they were all good too.   Needless to say, I highly recommend Marcy's."}
{"text":"I go to Marcy's when I miss eating filipino food.  Its okay to eat at once in a while... like Bianca says... their BBQ chicken is very juicy and yummy, but the food can be a hit and miss!  Vegetable lumpia is different, they must make it with sweet potato, quite gross in my opinion.  There are even foods I think... \"jeez, my mom doesn't make it that way, is it really what I ordered?\"  Lol."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Filipino take-out in the Greater Toronto Area.  I love their pancit palabok and beef caldereta.  Their okoy is bigger and better than everywhere else, as they use large shrimps and make it nice and crispy.  Marcy's other biggest hit is their vacuum packed marinated kalbi which is ready for the grill.  What a great idea!  Grab a $20 bag or two and have a great BBQ."}
{"text":"Reliable, friendly staff and good selection of filipino goods and cuisine.  We mostly come here for the bbq, tuyo, and the kare-kare and we love it every time. Definitely a fam fave for quick take out especially on days when life gets too busy for us to cook at home."}
{"text":"Definitely improved with food quality during a recent visit and surprise takeouts by the hubby when he is aware of my 'no cooking tonight' mood!! A lot more fresh and the service is warmer and friendlier. Maybe the season of Christmas is upon us! No? Too early? Bah, whateverrrr!!!  And yess!! I'm addicted to their homemade vinegar which they sell at this joint, perfectly spiced with the right amount of sweetness and tang, perfect for your springrolls and other 'vinegar dipping worthy' eats at home."}
{"text":"I only go here for the seasoned beef short ribs (raw) so that I can throw them on my barbecue. They're always a hit and they smell/taste delicious!   I only wish they sold the marinade!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for daing na bangus (pan fried milk fish) lately and this place satisfied it.  Their bangus is generally larger than most other places.  They don't make it too salty either so I can actually eat it without any rice.  The only thing you need to do is time it so it is freshly made, I unfortunately had one which was out there for a while and it didn't taste as good."}
