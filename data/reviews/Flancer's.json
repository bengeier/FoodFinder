{"text":"We always look forward to going to Flancer's when we come back to AZ for the winter. I usually order the hoagie & bacall italian. I was, to say the least very disappointed. Had to look very hard to find the meat on the hoagie. I ordered hash browns as my side and got room temperature, at best, American fries. I told the waitress that I ordered hash browns and she said that the owner considered those were hash browns. At Subway you can get an Italian footlong sub for $6 that is 100% better than Flancer's $11 sub. Sorry Flancer's we will not be returning and will pass the word to our friends."}
{"text":"We have been to Flancer's several times and never been disappointed.  Usually we eat there but sometimes order take out.  The pizza is great and the sandwiches are always fresh and great tasting.  The Gilbert location is usually crowded (sign of a successful business) and there is usually a lot of activity going on.  Glad to have Flancer's in Gilbert.  We heard they have a Mesa location on Higley and McKellips that we will try another time."}
{"text":"It was tough to decide if I should write a review for Flancer's or not.  It's already hard to get a seat from time to time, I certainly do not want to make it worse for myself!

The food and the service are fantastic.  The place is very small and large groups will not find a table here, unless it's on the misted patio.

The bread and the wheat wraps are homemade.  
A couple of must try's include: 
Philly CheeseSteak (get it with the works)
No Bones about It (try it in a wheat wrap)

You will find yourself drawn into the legend of the Flancer Goat and returning again and again..."}
{"text":"Great service. 
Food not so great.
Ordered turkey was very dry. 
Others commented on the price point, it is a little pricey for a sandwich in a restaurant with plastic chairs
Will not return."}
{"text":"We visited this Flancer's thanks to a Groupon that we purchased.  Heard mixed reviews and decided to try it anyways.

The layout of the location is too stuffy and even though we visited during the day there was not sufficient light.  Seated next to the area that had a stand with dirty dishes was not very appealing either.  Having grown up in the restaurant industry, it does not take much to take the used plates etc.. directly into the kitchen rather than it being in view for the customers in the dining area Its not appealing at all.

The service was super good, super efficient and super friendly and that is the best part of our experience.  

Heard good things about their sandwiches and it did not disappoint.  The Braised the Lord Beef and the Philly Cheese steak were good, but at over $10 each with the extras it was certainly pricey for a very casual dining place.  The sides of Jalapeno & Cheddar Mashed Potato Pie and the Macaroni & Cheese were both great options.

In summary, great service, good food but pricey, but awful layout and setup of the restaurant. The ambiance is as important as the food, and even the food was good, the dreary & non uplifting ambiance took all of the flavor of the food away.

Not sure if we will be back, even with a GroupOn as there are so many other choices."}
{"text":"A family owned restaurant in the heart of Gilbert which gives back to the community through fundraisers and friendly service...  When you get to know the employees they become like family, two of the very best are Mike and Ben! 

The food... Fantastic!  A great menu and really interesting specials.  Primarily this is a sandwich/pizza with in house freshly baked bread and wheat wraps however they take it a step further with bruschetta, mushroom Phylos and other good stuff!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this Flancer's location many, many times over the years.  This Father's Day we took my father and my husband to breakfast here.  It was the worst dining experience we've ever had, and I can't emphasize that enough.  We'd received a promotional email from Flancers for Fathers Day, regarding free Flancers coffee club mugs for Dad's and have always like Flancers, so thought this would be a good choice.   Even called Friday to see if they needed reservations or anything since it would be a Father's Day thing. None needed.

We got there about 8:30am, and there was only one other party in the restaurant.

The waitress, who we've had before, seated us at the first booth inside the front door, which is always hot as the kitchen and pickup area are right there also.  We asked to be moved to somewhere further inside, and she lead us straight back to a table in, and I mean, full sun coming through the windows.  I asked if we could take the table next to it, as that one was shaded.

We were told, and not cordially,  \"No, I need to have you in my line of sight, it's this or the booth you were at.\"   Wow, I mean wow.  We followed her back to the booth by the kitchen/front door.

When taking our drink order, my husband and I ordered coffee and my dad wanted orange juice.  I asked if I could get my coffee in the Flancers' mug as well to give to my dad.  Was told \"No, he has to order coffee to get a mug.\"  

My husband stepped in, and told her to give me the orange juice and give my dad the coffee/mug, and we could switch afterward to solve the problem.

To which she replied \"Well, if you want to be greedy.\"  Honestly, I was so stunned, I thought I hadn't heard this correctly.  Unfortunately, I had, as she left and my Dad, husband and mom all confirmed what I'd heard.  

We took no coffee refills or anything else, we ate and made the best of treating my Dad to Father's Day breakfast, then left to enjoy the rest of his day, in spite of her.

We have never, ever been treated so rudely by a wait person.  I always tip a minimum of 20%, but was struggling with this.  Fortunately, my husband paid the tab, and his tip was under 10%, it probably should have been nothing, with a phone call to the owner on top of it."}
{"text":"Food always good, no sandwich is bad, prickly pear chicken is the best, can't seem to get past it to try another sandwich ! Try it, you'll love it!! Has wifi at Gilbert location!"}
{"text":"First time hear asked Paul to give me the best seller and I can see why it is. You can tell everything is fresh made. Don't be fooled by the pink chicken it's fully cooked and delicious. Will be recommending Flancer's to everyone I come across"}
{"text":"So another time and the same place and I cannot tell you how great this place is. Their pizzas are so delish, I have a hard time deciding between the pizza and sandwiches. Homemade breads are so delish, they should package them and sell them. Everyone is always so nice and just a great place. This time I did a to-go pizza and just taking it out of the oven when I walk in the door. YUM! pipping hot and so delish, they never skimp on the toppings and the crust is just perfect, light and a little crisp. I consider myself a regular and don't even hesitate on where to-go for my pizza now. There is no comparison!!!"}
{"text":"The prickly pear chicken sandwich is fantastic, unfortunately, it is so good that I have thus far, refused to try anything else. It is sweet, savory and has a little kick to it! 

Also, I have actually dreamed about their green chili mac and cheese- best side dish ever! 

There are two location in the east valley, one in down town Gilbert and the other in north Mesa, I prefer the Mesa location because it is less crowded, so I usually don't wait for a table."}
{"text":"Such great service! This place caters to both adults and kids with goldfish crackers while the kids wait and delicious happy hour brews every day. Nice casual and local restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered another pizza for take-out!  The pizza is just fabulous.  And just love the fact that they are soy free.  Makes life so easy to just order and eat:)  No worries with an allergic reaction.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  It seems that in the evenings this place is very quiet, but I am sure the lunchtime crowd is huge with its location close to Falcon Field, Boeing, and Apache Helicopter.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I Love this place. I had the vegetarian sandwich with sub- goat cheese...and it was wonderful. I am not vegan/ vegetarian either.I also had a bite of my friends turkey ...added Bacon and avocados...so good. The bread it so soft...and I highly recommend the potato cakes!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the only reasons we miss living in Gilbert.  So good.  My husband's favorite sandwich is the \"We must meat,...\""}
{"text":"I love me a good sandwich and Flancer's delivers!  We shall start with the bread, as it is fantastic.  Good flavor, perfect level of chewiness, and not all hard and crusty.  These guys get the bread right.  I had the shrimp sandwich, because I love the combo of shrimp and avocado.  The shrimp was overseasoned so it stood out, but the flavor profiles fit well together.  In all, a very satisfying lunch experience.

Flancer's missed the fourth star because the shrimp was overseasoned and the sweet potato fries (that cost a dollar extra) were just so-so."}
{"text":"I heard about Flancer's through a foodie blog on what foods to eat in each state.  They featured the prickly pear cactus for Arizona and suggested Flancer's for their prickly pear chicken sandwich.  My husband and I decided to stop by on our way to New Mexico and we were very happy that we did!  Upon entering the restaurant, we were cheerfully welcomed by the manager and promptly seated.  The place began getting packed as it was lunch time.  I ordered the (prickly pear chicken) sandwich and salad lunch combo, as I was worried I wouldn't like the sandwich (never had prickly pear before). I ended up wishing I ordered the full order of the sandwich! It was unbelievably delicious! The bread was amazing.  My tastebuds were going crazy and wanted more!  My husband ordered the buffalo wings, and even though he said they were really good, upon taking a bite of my sandwich, he said he wished he ordered it instead.  I know we will make it a point to come to Flancer's whenever we are in the Phoenix/Mesa area."}
{"text":"I just want to say we frequent flancers using there take out, this is not the way to go. I don't know about all of you but with no ac by the time I get home and discover something wrong it's tooooo hot to go back. There have been several orders that were wrong, or someone else's. I have ordered the bread pudding twice first time it came with no ice cream the second time it did, the second time my bread pudding was burnt most of it was not edible so trash it went at least the ice cream was good. My green chili Mac and cheese was not only cold it was very bland, I have had it before so I know how yummy it is. The BLT was not the same and have ordered before. I also another time called ordered a sandwich ? the pastrami one? was told they do not have it anymore, what? So the next time I went in there I asked and this was not true. Going forward I will never order take out, my experience is dining in is better, at least if there is an issue it will get corrected right away. You just don't get the warm fuzzy feeling from the gals that answer the phone to take order, feels like your putting them out. Sorry cannot give 5 stars"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Flancers in Gilbert three times and recently tried this one in Mesa. I'm just not a big fan, the reason I kept going back is because its close to home and because of the rave reviews.  I figured I must be missing something. This last time I asked the server what was the best thing on the menu, she replied about a roast beef sandwich, really it was just OK and the same with my wife's salad, nothing special. Really I much prefer Crackers for sandwiches and Vito's for pizza."}
{"text":"This is a great, casual local restaurant.  The sandwiches and pizza are unique and tasty!  Homemade bread and sauces make this place stand out.  A couple of my favorites--the Chile Verde Birdie sandwich (REAL turkey breast, not sliced deli junk!) or the Goat to Get You Into My Life pizza (the most AMAZING homemade pesto and goat cheese... mmmm!).

The owner is a professionally trained and experienced chef, who you'll likely meet if you participate in one of their many charitable events.  He sat down and chatted with us at one of his beer pairing events, this one held to raise money for a local child's heart transplant.

We love the laid back, non-stuffy atmosphere.  This will remain one of our regular weekend eateries."}
{"text":"They have good service but sometimes at lunch it gets pretty loud and crowded so you want to go a little early or late from the midday lunch rush.  I pretty much always get their Philly Cheesesteak sandwich and really like the bread they use.  Its always been fresh and they very consistent about how they make it each time.  Great place to try."}
{"text":"Just tried their breakfast menu for first time: breakfast burrito with sausage and green sauce, avocado toast with chorizo, biscuits and gravy. Delish!! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding sandwiches!

Found this place because its in the parking lot of my favorite taco stop. Finally decided to pop in.

Ordered 2 sandwiches, asked the girl to give me 2 of her favorite things, to go. Not disappointed in the least bit.

Some chicken sandwich thing and some nice steak sandwich which looked like it had 4 nice big pieces of what appeared to be Tri Tip in it.

ALL GOOD!!

Dont have the names of what we ate because I literally have no idea. Will go back and sit down next time and try something else. This place is very small, not much for indoor seating from what I could tell.

Staff seemed sterile but then again, I was just picking up. I still judge places on things like that. I expect staff to say hello or offer a water to someone while they wait. Is that too much to ask? I dont think so.

Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in the area for the past three years and always drive by and say we should stop so one day we finally did. I'm glad we did because it was a very good eating experience and we will for sure be going back. Pizza was super good but I have to say their chicken wings were AWESOME. Maybe the best I've had yet. Looking forward to ordering a sandwich next time to try. OH and we couldn't stop telling the waitress how great everything was and how it was our first time so she ended up giving us a 15% off coupon for our next visit-BONUS :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to Flancers since they opened, I remember the waiter would give my kids each a quarter to get a gumball from the machine before we left.  They were young then, and now they are grown and out of the house.  Much of the staff are still there!

  The food is great, the dedication to your satisfaction is obvious.  I think I have had almost everything on the menu, and it is all great.  Don't forget the daily specials, I frequently order them since it is usually something different.

Best sandwiches ever!"}
{"text":"Since our first outing to Flancer's, we have returned there probably 7 times.  My wife and I were bored and looking for something different to eat, and saw Flancer's highly recommended on Yelp.  The help is very, very friendly and helpful with recommendations.  Our first outing, I had the \"We Must Eat, I ain't Lion\" filet mignon sandwich, and my wife ordered the \"Its about Thyme\".  My sandwich was good, but the \"Its about Thyme\" is just outstanding.  Their bread is always very fresh, and the chicken tastes perfect with the thyme.  Since that first time, my wife has changed to ordering the \"Perfect Prickly Pear Chicken\" sandwich, but I continue to order the \"Its about Thyme.\"

I would highly recommend anyone with a craving for great service and great food to stop by Flancer's and try the \"Its about Thyme.\""}
{"text":"Food is always excellent here. My go to sandwiches are the philly cheesesteak or it's about thyme.  The bruschetta is also awesome. The salads and desserts are also very good!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this Flancer's especially their Match with Hatch, Verde Turkey and bacon/salmon sandwich.
My last visit this week was surprisingly not as good as it had been in the past.  My Verde Turkey was on a much smaller bun and there was very little green chile mayo on it.  My fruit cup had maybe 3 strawberries sliced very thin.  My husband's Match with Hatch was also on a smaller bun and a smaller amount of green chile.

Our server was attentive and kind, but service was slow.  A little disappointed.  I hope it was just a fluke.  We've been faithful customers for years.  Left us wondering what changed."}
{"text":"Flancer's has the most AMAZING sandwiches put that together with a great staff, that's what makes this one of my favorite places in town to eat!"}
{"text":"This place has very nice staff. Now I am done with the good. The food here was horrific. It tastes straight from a can or the freezer. My boyfriend ordered a Philly cheesesteak sand which. It cost extra for the peppers, mushrooms, and more for the onions. That wouldn't have been so bad IF they were fresh veggies but they were soggy from being frozen. This Philly cheesesteak didn't even contain cheese just to add to the disappointment. I ordered Mac and cheese. It was served with slices of bread on the side which ended up being the most flavorful part. The Mac and cheese was clearly made using a cheese sauce from a can and lacked any actual seasoning. It was topped with bread crumbs that were twice as hot as the Mac and cheese which let me know they weren't even made together. I had a buy one get on free entree and my bill still was $18.22. It felt like a joke. Nothing like disappointment for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Wings were perfect, prickly pear sandwich was on the freshest bread and the fries were nice and hot.  Couldn't ask for a better meal!"}
{"text":"We love the prickly pear sandwich! Kids love the kids menu. Only thing we have tried and didn't like was the Buffalo sauce on the wings and sandwich. Everything else is awesome!"}
{"text":"You would think with the economy as bad as it is service would be a priority! One guy rolled his eyes after he brought me the wrong food! Another argued with me once! I used to be a regular! Love there awesome balsam salad! Unfortunately they have been RUDE too many times! I am no longer wanting to EVER GO THERE! Even the manager that used to talk to me only talks to certain people! What an unprofessional way to try and run a business!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!!! My grandpa and I go here just every time I'm at his house, and it is better every time. I usually get the Ace of clubs turkey, and their green chili mayonnaise is something special. I have tried to copy it numerous times, I may have to ask for their secret. The pizza is good too, and I love their prickly pear marinated chicken. Keep up the good work Jeff!!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out while in the area having never heard of it before.  The manager greeted me at the front and had me seated super fast.  He was very friendly and talkative.  The server was not as personable and may have been having a bad day.  I love buffalo chicken and went for the buffalo chicken sandwich with jalapeño Mac and cheese. The food came out quick!  The sandwich itself was perfect .  The bread was probably the best I have tried in Arizona.  The Mac and cheese was hot and not all that flavorful but by no means bad.  

I didn't get the theme there.  It was like an Italian restaurant/sports bar/sandwich place with weird decor all over that doesn't really jive.  

All in all I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ended up here one afternoon about a month ago, and never got around to writing a well deserved 5 star review. I order a half sandwich and let me tell you it was wonderful. This place is noisy and crowded, so if you're looking for a quiet lunch this is not the place for you.... Food is great. wait staff great."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good Philly cheesesteak and I found one! Was feeling a little home sick for back east and this sandwich took me back to Pennsylvania"}
{"text":"Just amazing! The stuffed mushroom appetizer is last meal material. Great food, great staff. They let a nonprofit display info outside, classy!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying, I love the Yelp app and I think it's a very useful tool for finding great food and not wasting your money. Its usually spot on but not tonight at Flancers.  Preparation of the food was terrible. First the wrong cheese then the bacon was missing. How do you mess up one sandwich that bad. Even the desserts were left unfinished. Just bland and certainly not worth the $40 we paid. Our waitress was great, but you can't run a restaurant on great service alone..."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for pizza and wings this week, so I figured I'd give Flancer's a try. I love supporting local eateries, so I held out hope that they would deliver on the goods. Let's just say that I've had way better. 

I'll start with the wings. They were just OK. The flavor was decent, but they were not very saucy. One was a bit undercooked, which is basically an instant turn-off. I'm just glad it was the last wing in the order. One bright spot is that they at least give you carrot and celery sticks with some good ranch dressing as part of the order (vs. charging for them as some places do). 

As for the pizza, they get an 'A' for the crust, but a 'D' on the sauce. Their crust is thin and done just the way I like it (NY style). The sauce, however, was just boring. Too much salt and too much garlic and not enough tomatoes. I kept checking to see if there was actually sauce on the pizza. The sausage on the pizza was fairly blah, too. My 8 year-old daughter summed it up by saying that she thought a frozen pizza would have tasted better. Gotta love kids. I felt the pizza crust was good enough that I may be willing to try a non-red sauce pie next time to see if fares better. 

I was generally bummed because my craving for good pizza and wings was not satisfied. I see people raving about the sandwiches and the salads, so maybe that is the path I need to go down if I ever go back.

{"text":"My husband and I love Flancer's!  We've tried several sandwiches and salads, as well as a few of the appetizers.  Everything has tasted great!  The service is good, the waitstaff friendly and they have tv's if you don't want to miss the game.  If you are looking for some good food, in a casual, relaxed atmosphere from a local business, then I would highly recommend this place."}

+Got seated quickly
+Excellent fries
+Great sandwiches
+Good starting service
+Free wifi!

Cons

-Service seems to lack the longer you're there
-After eating dinner it took another 15-20 minutes to get our desert 


Overall it's a fantastic place, but once our main order was in we didn't receive service nearly as quick.

Added a photo of Prickly pear spiked lemonade."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Flancer's! Nice staff, friendly, and tasty food!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends to Flancer's and everyone loved the food! Between us we had the Prickly Peat sandwich and the Philly Cheese Steak, all with beer battered fries.  For dessert, we shared the Pecan Pie Cheesecake which was a hit with all of us.

I had seen this sandwich place mentioned on Check, Please! Arizona and it was not a disappointment.  From the casual but cool atmosphere to the friendly, attentive service and great food, we all agreed we will be back!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Only 1 option for sandwich bread. There tasteless roll or tortilla. 
Turkey was ok, not much for what you pay for. Hardly any vegetables on bread. I had to ask for onions. 

If anyone is from California, Togo's sandwiches are 100% better."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Just had a fabulous salad.  With great friends.  Excited to ty the oat bar for dessert."}
{"text":"Judging by the twenty minute wait to be seated for lunch at 1 PM on a Friday afternoon, Flancer's Cafe in Gilbert (there's one in Mesa, too), doesn't need any publicity from me. There's also more than 50 mostly four and five star reviews on Yelp. And  the Arizona Republic gave it a glowing review in September. After our lunch, I can tell you that Ken and I heartily agree with all the praise.

     Flancer's is a small, unpretentious place. The menu is basically bar food - wings, salads, sandwiches, pizza, and some pasta. What made it worth our 30 minute drive is the care and thought that goes into the preparation. Jeff Flancer, the owner, is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America. When he gives you a steak sandwich, its a 
filet mignon sandwich ($10.75), tender and cooked to order - and served on a freshly baked homemade roll. With caramelized onions and house made chipotle mayo that has the perfect amount of kick. Oh, and gorgonzola cheese, too. Accompanied with an interesting choice of sides, like jalapeno & cheddar mashed potato pie or sweet potato fries. Ken says that Jeff knows what people like to eat, then he thinks of a way to improve on it. Like the onion soup ($3/5) that has a ton of cheese on top, not the thin slice that lots of places try to get away with these days. The pastrami in Ken's \"Cure Heaven\" sandwich (every item on the menu has a name) was very flavorful, served hot with provolone and mustard ($8). Portions are large, but not overwhelming. The only disappointment was the pickle - not bad, but not up to the level of the rest of the meal.

     For nine years, Jeff had a restaurant in Santa Fe. There are a number of dishes using a variety of chilis, like the Santa Fe BLT ($8) that comes with New Mexican green chili mayonnaise. Or the Baked Chipotle Fettuccini (Jeff's spelling) ($11): \"Baked fettuccini with sausage, pepperoni & ground beef with chipotle cream marinara sauce & melted mozzarella cheese\". An appetizer I have to try is Flancer's Green Chile Mushroom Phyllos ($7.50).

     Something that shines through at Flancer's is pride in the staff (our waiter was excellent), and caring for the community. On the website there are pictures and bios of many of the staff members. If you order a particular dessert, proceeds are donated to a youngster from the community who needs a heart transplant. There are raffles and a yearly pizza eating contest with proceeds also going to charity. The vibe here is really good. 

     Flancer's is open daily from 10:30 to 9 PM, with Happy Hour from 3 - 7 (they serve a Prickly Pear Lemonade spiked with vodka that sounds really good). There's free wi-fi, and on some nights there's music. Check out the menu on their website."}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly service.  We will definitely be back.  I had the prickly pear chicken sandwich with fries.  I'm thinkin' it was a good choice but my husband had a chicken parm sandwich that looked pretty good as well.  (It must have been good because he never even offered me a bite!)  Very casual atmosphere, with football on the TVs.  Seems like a good place to catch a game while eating tasty food."}
{"text":"Been here a few time normally get the \"Chile Verde Birdie Turkey\" and it's always good this time I tried the \"Philly Cheese Steak\" with The Works. I enjoyed it at first I second guessed my order thinking most likely it wasn't good be that good but I was impressed it's wasn't like a Original Philly Cheese Steak the bread was different the meat also but it had great flavor. I also tried the \"Goat Cheese Bruschetta\" and that was amazing"}
{"text":"Flancer's is just down the street from my house, so we've been a few times.  Even with the massive signs they hang out front and the creepy balloon guy (you know, the kind that 'dances' around as the air passes through it?), Flancer's is easy to miss.  It was there a few months before we even noticed it enough to stop by.  If you miss it, though, it's a loss!  We consistantly try different items and we've yet to be disappointed.

On our most recent visit, we decided to give the salads a go.  Let me interject, really quick, that if it's your first visit, I would really recommend you try their sandwiches.  They've got a variety of awesome sandwiches (love me some prickly pear chicken!) on their own fresh-baked bread and the sweet potato fries make an excellent side.  That said, we'd done the sandwich thing and we wanted to see if their salads matched up.

Short story long, they did!  The only complaint was that the prices were perhaps a bit high for what you got compared to some other places, but the food was still delicious.  I had the Crispy Parmesean Chicken Salad.  I ordered the small ($6) and it was just the right amount of food.  Any more than that and I would have had leftovers.  The chicken had a great texture.  I'm always wary of anything labelled 'crispy' because you run the risk of massive amounts of breading that completely overwhelm any chicken beneath.  Not so, here.  I had it with the gorgonzola dressing.  A moment to rave about the dressing- it was rich, flavorful and had massive chunks of gorgonzola cheese heavy within.  That said, I probably wouldn't order this salad with the gorgonzola again.  Save the gorgonzola for a simple garden salad; anything else and it overwhelms the rest of the salad. 

My friend had the Awesome Balsam Salad.  She chose the large ($9) and it was pretty massive!  It was served with balsamic marinated chicken, which had a great flavor that implied it had been marinating for a decent amount of time and wasn't  just cooked in the stuff, roasted red peppers and mushrooms.  My friend loved the mushrooms!  She was wise and ordered it with the balsamic dressing which was a very nice compliment to the rest of the salad.

We love the music they play at Flancer's.  Possibly my favorite part, because I'm a big fan of classic rock.  The service, unfortunately, can be hit or miss there, but this time was just fine.  I would say that, overall, we had a typical experience for Flancer's, which is saying a lot because they set a high standard."}
{"text":"One of the original restaurants along Gilbert Rd.  Always have quick service and great food when we go there.  The bread and pizza dough is insane!"}
{"text":"Consistently awesome. Pizza, salads, sandwiches... I've tried most of it and it never fails to impress. Loves the atmosphere and the staff."}
{"text":"I had a vegetarian sandwich with fresh avocado. And a decent amount!   Loved the bread. Definitely home made. Had a side salad that was substantial. Wait staff friendly. I will Return!"}
{"text":"Ordered through door dash and wasn't sure exactly what to expect with my order of the goat to have it salad. 
 Well, it was delicious! Consisted of lettuce, goat cheese medallions, tomato slices, cucumber slices, sun dried tomatoes and chickpeas. Vegetarian friendly and with the gorgonzola dressing it was out of this world! Small size was perfect for a meal and the garlic breadsticks on the side really rounded it out as a very filling and substantial meal!!
Will order again and again!!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this food by attending a catered event at Fox Cigar Bar (just down the street) and have been hooked ever since. 

My go to item is the Prickly Pear sandwich with a side of fries. The green chilli mayo is to die for! It's spicy, sweet and just makes your taste buds tingle.

All the staff is very personable and service is always perfect.

I look forward to having many, many, more meals at this place!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times. Had a salad the first time and the prickly pear sandwich the second time. Both were excellent! The service was great and the atmosphere even better. The only negative is a very small and awkward parking lot. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Initially quite skeptical, and fearing another notch on the link of trendy family owned restaurants that disappoint, I found this to be the best meal I have had in a long time. 

Environment was very pleasing, with bright colors, easy to navigate, and appropriate noise level. Listening to \"looking out my back door\" by ccr was a plus one. 

Onto the main course: I had the prickly pear chicken sandwich with a side of green chili Mac and cheese. 

Sammich: I will stop short of calling this the best sandwich ever created, but will say it is the sandwich that has everything you have ever needed. The chicken is slightly opaque and vibrantly pink in color (poached? Baked?) with a subtle sweet and sour flavor and a unique tang I can only think to be the flavor of prickly pear. This, coupled with a slightly spicy yet creamy green chili spread was the perfect balance of sweet, sour, heat, and salty. Topped with well shredded lettuce that was enough to play on cold and hot (and not too much that the sandwich imploded on it self like a collapsing star), made this sandwich second to none. 

*quick note in the baguette, hands down the best I have had. Most French baguettes used for sandwich are hard and crusty for an overbearing amount of flaky texture that it just feels like biting into a giangtic non sugary piece of captain crunch that destroys the roof of your mouth. This, however, is incredibly soft in the middle and lends itself well to the filling. With a crunchy and cheery crust that makes it incredible. 

Mac and cheese: I am typically a purist for Mac and cheese and don't like any additional inherited (from the school of thought of \"stopped putting tomatoes, broccoli, or chicken on Mac and cheese, it isn't meant to be healthy\"). This however was perfectly cooked pasta, lightly dressed in a spicy green chili cheese sauce. Could eat this forever.   

As far as price, it isn't that expensive. We walked out for 20 on a Friday night. Yelpers that don't have cash, don't go out. This place is well worth twice the price."}
{"text":"We have consistently had great food here. The service waxes and wanes. This past visit the service was great. This visit my daughter ordered the prickly pear chicken sandwich and rated it a 5. I got the it's about thyme sandwich and it was good. The prickly pear flavors surpassed the thyme. The gluten free bread was good. The jalapeño cheddar potato pie was great. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"a little pricey for a sandwich shop, very loud and non-atmospheric, I don't see the appeal of waiting to cram myself in a small box for overpriced sandwiches...and some very odd ones at that.  I love unique, but this is too unique for me."}
{"text":"I don't get it, I just don't. The atmosphere is bland and uncomfortable, the food was pedestrian, at best. The presentation was very blah, and I just didn't think it was anything to write home about. Why the 4 stars, Gilbert? This is one of the few local joints I won't come back to."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite spot in gilbert. Super friendly staff, and reasonable prices. The half-baked cookie for dessert is a must to try. I've been there millions of times and I have absolutely no complaints. They're just too amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try breakfast. The eggs unbenedict are very good. Add extra green chili and BAM!  Awesome food! And service is always excellent. Wife had the breakfast burrito and it was just as good."}
{"text":"Not only are the sandwiches great but the service is just spectacular.  Go there a few times and they'll never forget your name.  

It would be impossible for me to recommend one sandwich.  I'm partial to the, It's about thyme but I also love the philly, the hoagie and countless others.  The thing that makes their sandwiches so great is the bread.  (They bake their own).  The green chile mayonaise is awesome too!  If your sandwich doesn't have come with it then I recommend you order a side for your fries.

Although they have pasta and pizza, stick to the sandwiches.  They are just too good to pass up"}
{"text":"Service was great last two times ...food hasn't been as great I'm sad to say..my favorite place is off our list now.way expensive for not great food.2 sandwiches and fries should never cost nearly 30 bucks( we drink water )"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I go there at least once a week. My favorite two dishes are the 'Spinach Wheel'  Salad and the 'It's about Thyme' Sandwich. The atmosphere is down to earth and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Great Food and Great Service!!!!  The prickly pear chicken sandwich is da bomb!!  Also, Blueberry Cobbler is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"I've driven by Flancers a number of times and finally decided to give them a try because I noticed they had some outdoor seating.  I went during their \"happy hour\" time and although the wait staff was courteous, I felt like the host was \"annoyed\" when I asked to sit outdoors (it was just me), but he accommodated me.  

I asked my server to recommend an appetizer (starving!) and told him I was going to get a sandwich later.  He suggested the sweet potatoe fries, which were pretty good, but he didn't tell me that there was an option to have the fries as a side with my sandwich.  So I basically paid $4 for a small plate of fries that I could've gotten with my meal.  :(  Boo.  Guess I would've liked him to point that out so that I could try something different! 

Anyways - I got their steak sandwich with a side salad and although it was good, it wasn't my favorite. It didn't  stand out to me.  I love the filet sandwich at Four Peaks and this didn't top that.  

I'd like to give 'em another try sometime...so I'll update then.  For now, they are \"ok,\" but not sure I'll go out of my way to stop by there again."}
{"text":"My friends and I recently visited Flancer's on our lunch hour.  We call in our order ahead as we have a very short time period to eat and the service there is consistently slow.  In the past, Flancer's had been very accomodating to us by having our order ready and IF there was a table available, we were able to sit down.  On our most recent visit, the staff was not so accomodating.  The restaurant was 30 percent full and there were 15 open tables, yet the manager on duty refused to let us sit at a table.  After sending several e-mails to the owner of Flancer's (Jeff Flancer), the best he had to offer was a \"that's our policy\" line.  We will be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwich and casual dining place.   You know you've arrived somewhere special when the walls are lined with vintage psychedelic poster art from some of the biggest bands. That sets the tone for the menu:  great taste from a unique blend of flavors that come together in just the right way. 

I highly recommend the wings with a 1/2 Prickly Pear sandwich with a specialty salad."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and other casual fare. Comfy atmosphere and friendly staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't think of one single thing that has been bad there.  They have some  amazing flavor combinations that can get you out of your sandwich rut.  This place is definitely worth a try, you're sure to find something to love!"}
{"text":"We have been customers of Flancer's since they opened and have recommended them to more people they we can count.  The first place out of town guests want to go, is to Flancers...now what more of an endorsement can you ask for.  They have a varied menu, all delicious and their warm and friendly staff make it seem like our second home.  Even though we no longer live in the area, our first choice when we make the 50+ mile trip to the valley, is Flancer's!"}
{"text":"OMG, Flancer's is so good. The place was very clean, the employees very friendly, and the food was outstanding. Had the BLT and what can I say I am hooked!!"}
{"text":"Food took forever, and was cold when it arrived, although it still tasted pretty good. After waiting that long, I expected it to be at least hot. French onion soup is hard to heat. The waitress kept saying they were short staffed and she was sorry. The air kept coming on and she said they couldn't do anything about that. Last time service was great, good was awesome."}
{"text":"Out for a quick lunch and decided to try Flancers. Yummy yummy yummy!  We were met with a genuine smile at the door an escorted to a comfortable booth.  The restaurant has a rock n roll theme without being over the top. Music was at a comfortable level.  Started with green chili mushroom phyllos. It was do good that we didn't get a picture. My husband ordered the \"Beat It Just Beat It\". Spinach carrots glazed salmon arugula goat cheese roasted red peppers beets and slivered almonds. His verdict \"one of the best salads he's had in the area with out a doubt!\"  I had the Chili Verde Bird with a side of green chili MAC n cheese. Stupendous. The sandwich was turkey cooked in the restaurant sliced right off the bird. Very moist  it came with green chili mayo. As someone from New Mexico I'm picky about my green chili and Flancers does it right. The bread complemented the sandwich perfectly and it's made fresh at the restaurant. The host Eric and our waitress, Ashley  , checked on us throughout the meal keeping our plates cleared and glasses filled. They also convinced us to get the fresh baked 1/2 chocolate chip cookie w vanilla bean ice cream. Heaven. 

Draft beers:  Kilt Lifter, bud light, Dales Pale Ale, and Great White. 

And they donate $1.50 from the sale of each piece of peanut butter pretzel pie to \"No Child Hungry\". Every year they have a contest for the best recipe dessert. The winner chooses a charity to donate to for the year. 

Also an extensive gluten free and light menu.

{"text":"I live in the West Valley and whenever I meet my family in the East valley it HAS to be Flancers.  I love the fresh baked bread and the philly style sandwich (get the green chilil mayo...soooo good) is my favorite.  I hear everything else is good but I don't know since I always get the same dang thing!  Maybe if I lived closer I would try more..."}
{"text":"Pros:

Solid Philly cheesesteak(although a bit on the small side)

Green chili stew was great

Fries were good. 

Service was good

Cons:

Burger was very plain. No seasoning at all. Tasted like plain ground beef. 

Green chili Mac n cheese was just ok

$3 for a soda is ridiculous 

$42 bill(including 20% tip for 2 at lunch time is a bit high."}
{"text":"My visit was unplanned and actually stopped in a mexican restaurant next door but they closed early for Halloween at 3pm? Glad they did. After a suggestion from my knowledgeable server Ben, I decided to have the Cure Heaven Pastrami sandwich. The Pastrami was good not dry and the bread to meat ratio was perfect. The cheese and green chiles were okay but didn't really stand out. I ordered jalapeños on the side which kicked the heat factor up a little. Just wish I had the bread toasted a option I wasn't aware of. Now my side dish, Green Chile Stew.  This was so good!!! Next time I will order a bowl of it. The stew consist of shredded pork, green Chile with a little kick, potatoes,  and pinto beans. This green chile stew was by far better than I've had at any Mexican restaurant  or even mine made at home. This was my first but not last, the stew is available to go."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Flancer's.  I driven past this place for years, and can't figure out for the life of me, why I waited so long to try it.  

The menu is simple, sandwiches, burgers, pizzas.  The inside is small, even after the remodel/expansion.  While I think it's cozy, I also see a lot the people waiting to get in, and trying to cram into that little parking lot.  I personally despise waiting in lines, so that may have contributed to my initial hesitation.  

It looks a little retro inside, with neon signs, those red plastic/fiberglass chairs from decades gone by, cozy booths, and pictures of old record covers lining the walls.  

They have rocking sandwiches and, wait for it.......fresh squeezed lemonade!!!  They even make an adult version of it laced with liquor.  And here's the very best part.....they offer gluten free bread for the sandwiches and burgers.  Not only do they offer it, they understand it, and execute it with skill and grace.  

Brandee, our server, was great.  When I asked about the gluten free bread, she was surprisingly knowledgeable, even asking about severity of my allergy, and addressed possible cross contamination, with no prompting from me whatsoever.  I was actually a little stunned.  Here's a place that finally gets it right.  Not only do they offer it, they make sure their employees are trained and well versed in it.  Some other establishments I've been to recently could learn a lot from them.  

Everything tasted fresh, my fresh squeezed lemonade never fell below half a glass, and the gluten free toasted bread on my sandwich was as close to perfection as one can get sans gluten.  

You totally made my day!  Keep on rockin', Flancer's!"}
{"text":"Came for date night on the recommendation of a few friends and the good reviews on Yelp. It did not disappoint!  I was excited to try the Prickly Pear Chicken sandwich. It was delicious - the only thing that would have made it better was a little more of the green chile mayo! My husband tried the Breakfast Burger and also throughly enjoyed his meal. The service was excellent. My only complaint was the food was a little slow coming out, but with it being Friday night at 7pm that's to be expected. Definitely looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful food. Great selection and quick service. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after reading a rave review in the Arizona Republic. The Verde Birdie was sliced turkey, a slice of cheese, and a tomato slice, all cold, only a smidge of mayo, no chipotle tang. Bread was homemade, but also right out of the fridge. So sandwich was dry and bland, nowhere near worth $8.75. Fries were inedible (hard and tasteless), and they charged an extra $1 to try the sweet-potato fries. Never again..."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because the Mesa location is very close to us. But having tried it a few times, the service has been less than desirable. We don't care for New Mexico style food (lots of peppers and onions etc.) which is what most of this menu seems to be. I keep reading about the Prickly Pear Chicken sandwich here on yelp. It looks like I will need to give it a try. Being from AZ, prickly pear anything is typically very good."}
{"text":"Went to Flancer's with friends. It is one of their favorites. And now one of mine. Had the Philly Cheese Steak and it was outstanding. The bread was a perfect compliment for the sandwich. Soft and tasty. Meat was cooked just right. Will return often."}
{"text":"My dad had an insurance office across from Flancer's so my family has been coming here for years and we absolutely love it! The sandwiches are amazing as well as the soups. They bake their own bread daily which is the secret behind their unbelievably good sandwiches. The waiters and waitresses are all very friendly in fact my family comes in so often we know them all by name. I would defiantly suggest Flanker's to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here. First time I tried the Cheesesteak, this time I got the Prickly Pear Chicken Sandwich. I must say, this place has excellent tasting food from the small sampling I've had thus far! I'm gonna keep working my way down the menu. Trevor at Flancer's is a great guy and the staff is very friendly here. I think I've finally found a place I will frequent on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Killer sandwiches! I tried a chicken sandwich and the Philly Cheesesteak and they were both excellent! Great bread and decent prices. Overall, I was extremely impressed and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Update!!!  Attention Breakfast Lovers!!!  The breakfasts have truly only gotten better with time.  If you want a great atmosphere with awesome food and wonderful people, this is your place.  

Not only are Greg and the whole team here at Flancer's absolutely awesome people that it's just fun to see and hang out with... the food is amazing!  Being a displaced New Mexican it's hard to find great Green Chile.  The Match the Hatch is the best Green Chile Cheeseburger west of Albuquerque!  Now they are also doing breakfast!  Please come out and support!  The food is awesome!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation in the area for 8 days and ate here TWICE!  Why?  The Prickly Pear Cactus Chicken Caesar Salad!  It is delicious. There is a sweet sauce on the chicken (from the Prickly Pear fruit) and it is just so good!  My husband had a Salmon Sandwich and loved it too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Amazing subs, love the Hatch green chile on the burger, filet mignon sandwich, the bread is amazing. Cool place and staff - have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Flancer's is pretty great. I've never had a bad sandwich or pizza here. Try the prickly pear. Yes, I know goat cheese pizza is trendy and not authentic, but it's still really good!

My only real complaint is no draft beer. They've recently expanded this location so if you found it too small before that's been addressed."}
{"text":"I think this is the highest rating I've given yet. I love this place it makes everyone in my family happy. 
When you enter it is awkward as there is nowhere to go so you just hope they will have a table ready or it's winter and not hot outside. 
I order the same thing when I go (this is a pattern in most of my reviews) the Turkey sandwich with green chile mayo, avocado and bacon. Basic right? Until you put it all on their bread - oh my gosh - that bread or bun whatever they call it is so incredible! Couple that with nice service, quirky decor, and good beer in bottles and it's one of my favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"Nice quaint place. I found the food a bit greasy. Service was pretty slow. I've been there twice and the first time was much better than the second. They make an ok sandwich.  Nothing that I'm rushing back for but ok."}
{"text":"Had heard good things about this place and was pretty disappointed.  I am beginning to realize that maybe the majority of people enjoy subpar food.
I'm going to start with this; I really resent restaurants that serve tap water.  The water is disgusting.  Can you please spend the money on a filtration system?  Even if I bought a soft drink it's the same disgusting water.  Lost a star based on that.
We had a fondue appetizer, it was the best thing we had.  Bread should have been toasted a little but but whatever.  It was a generous portion with lots of cheese and chicken and a nice kick of spice.
Hubby got meatloaf.  It said it came with onion gravy jus?  None that I saw.  (do they know that jus means juice?) Meatloaf had a sort of tomato onion chutney on the top.  Maybe homemade ketchup?  That was good.  Meatloaf was nothing impressive and a small portion.  Laid that on top of a jalapeño cheese potato \"pie\".  I wish it would have been separated because the tomato and meatloaf kinda clash here.
My pastrami was ok.  Should be on a different bread, this is like bread for a french dip; kinda spongy and dry.  In fact my sandwich was dry.  Pastrami had a gamey taste to it like it was lamb or goat.
I'm gonna say the worst thing was the macaroni and cheese.  It was dry and tasteless with overdone macaroni.  Needed more cheese sauce.  Someone is being verrry skimpy with the sauce. And the flavor.
Wasn't happy about dropping 50 bucks on this cafeteria food.
They had a lot of interesting sounding sandwiches......I might be back.  I know the fondue was good so maybe I just got things they aren't good at.  I'll keep my pastrami business with Haven Burger."}
{"text":"The Gilbert location just started offering breakfast this weekend so we had to try it out. The hash browns (diced, not shredded) were crispy and very flavorful.  The avocado toast was more like a sandwich (lightly toasted bread, egg, cheese, tomato and avocado) but very good. The chorizo and potato dish was like a good corned beef hash but with spicy chorizo instead. And the homemade biscuit was great."}
{"text":"Where the locals eat...apps, sandwiches, pizza, salads and desserts are all superb.  The fries alone keep me coming back.  Also, the staff is always welcoming and attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Just finished the balsamic chicken sandwich and husband had chili Verdi birdie sandwich with salad.  Everything was delicious.  Staff is great!   Thank you Greg and Myke and rest of Flancer's team"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches here... You can't go wrong, every single sandwich is amazing!  If you haven't tried Flancer's yet, ya gotta go!"}
{"text":"Umm, yea I tried this place a few times and I didn't find anything that really stuck with me the Yelp review ew are so messed up out here and very misleading...it's a nice little cafe"}
{"text":"Went to Flancers the first time this last week.  I got the Prickly Pear Caesar Chicken.  I was not a fan.  The dressing didn't taste much like Caesar and while the Prickly Pear flavoring was tasty, it seemed odd for a Caesar.  I got the salad when we could not get a wheat crust pizza larger than 10 inch for the hubbie and I to share.  He said the pizza was okay, but it didn't look appetizing to me.  The bread that came w/ my salad, loaded w/ parmesan cheese, was tasty, but for a carb watcher, too much.  Now that I think about it, I don't remember the taste of parmesan on the salad.

My biggest knock on the place:  the lager beer selection.  American lagers only.  I don't care for American lagers.  Bud Light makes me burp, a lot, and American lagers to me lack the flavor of a Stella, Phuket, Corona, Peroni, etc.  For a restaurant that offers beer pairings, they need to overhaul the lager selection for those of us not into ales.  I'd visit one more time if I could have a Stella w/ my meal, but with the lager selection, I can scratch them off my list."}
{"text":"This. Is. My. Favorite. Sandwich. Place. Ever...EVER!

Get the Green chili Turkey Birdie with sweet potato fries. you're welcome."}
{"text":"In this world of over-commercialised chain restaurants, bland clone food and depressingly similar menus it is a refreshing thing indeed to come across a place like Flancer's. Nothing fancy, no hughty attitudes, no faux ideals just really good food served by really friendly people plus some of the best music ever pressed in vinyl!

Sandwiches, salads, pizza and calzones along with wonderful wings and other things are really the entire menu. But the execution is flawless.

We have begun with Roasted Garlic Parmesan Bread and the Beer Battered Mozzerella Chees Triangles. Both are worth the trip. The bread is \"Flancer's Bread\" made fresh everyday right there. It is the same bread that all of Flancer's delightful sandwiches are served on and is so good that you won't leave any crusts behind. The cheese is a unique take on a bar food favorite and is served with a chipotle marinara sauce that was so good I wanted to poor it on everything.

The salads are all available in either small or large formats, but be warned; only the very hungry or an exhibishist eater is going to finish a large salad in one sitting. They are HUGE! We decided on small salads next time. But size is nothing without taste, and Flancer's salads are worth every penny. The \"Tenderloin is the Night\" salad is a wonderful creation with greens, marinaded roma tomatoes, crumbles of gorgonzola cheese, croutons and grilled beef tenderloin. Add in thier homemade gorgonzola dressing and you have art in a bowl.

The sandwiches are as varied as they are delicious,  the flagship is the Chile Verde Birdie, a turkey sandwich that knows no peer! Freshly roasted turkey breast sliced from the bone, provolone, lettuce, tomato and an out of this world New Mexican green chile mayo, on that awsomely tasty Flancer's Bread!

My personal favorite is the Parmesana Nirvana Chicken that is everything you would expect and then some. But here's a tip; ask you waiter to serve it with Flancer's chipotle marinara instaed of the regular marinara (which is wonderful, but I like the kick in the chipotle!) and you'll get a hot, cheesy, spicy delight of a sandwich. Extra napkins are highly recommended!

If you decide on fries you've made a wise choice as these seasoned crispy lovelys are on the list of best fries anyplace. Hot and tender with just a touch of spice, and unlike other sandwich shops they stay hot. (Or maybe we ate them so fast they didn't have time to get cold.) Either way they were great. Tip; ask for a side of Flancer's Gorgonzola Dressing to dip the fries in, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this!

We have not yet tried thier pizzas, but if the calzones are any indicator, (and they usually are), you'll never call Pizza Hut again! The calzone we had was the \"Nice to Meat You\" which is a carnivor's delight. Pepperoni, sausage, ham and ground beef with an extra helping of cheese! Serve with a side of marinara, (or even the chipotle marinara!) and you have enough food for 3 or 4 average people, or 2 really hungry ones! Wonderful!

Also found on the menu are a number of burgers, pasta dishes, soups and desserts. All of which we have not got to try yet, but we are patiently working through the menu and have found nothing to be disappointed in yet.

Truely it is wonderful to be saying \"so long\" to the rubberstamped restaurant clones of America and discovering little gems like Flancer's Cafe! Chain restaurants may be fine, but in these troubled economic times I do not want to receive \"average\" for my hard earned money. Why settle for bland when for the same price you can have \"outstanding\"?!

****************************************************************************

Just after the beginning of 2009 the owner at Flancer's Cafe did something unprecedented in the land of small business, he LOWERED his prices!!! Even more oddly the portion sizes have not change one iota nor has the quality of the food changed, only his margin. 

What a terrific thing to do for us customers in these lean financial times!"}
{"text":"Delicious soup and sandwiches. They'll even bring you a sample of the soups. I had green chile stew and loved it! Lots of meat, spicy but not knock your socks off hot. My husband had BLT and it was really good with a generous amount of bacon filled perfect. We'll definitely be back!  Service was very good and quick."}
{"text":"Jeff and his staff serve a mean menu of good food.... It is a great quaint little place that brings you back to how smaller restaurants were in years past - but with much better food...."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean, and try the Philly sandwich with the works and mayo jalapeno sauce"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch places to go for a quick but great quality meal. Great service and environment. My personal favorite order is the \"ace of clubs or the Let it BLT\". I highly recommend Flancer's to anyone. The good feel sandwich joint!"}
{"text":"Greasiest pizza I have had in a long time, see the picture. I was told by manager that all their pizzas are like that. He said all the oil pooled up in the middle of my pizza was due to my asking for it to be crispy, he claimed the extended time caused more oil to be released from the cheese. Um, yaaaaa. Service was good. I have given this place two chances, both times not impressed. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The sandwiches my wife and I were served were both very tasty and filling. Her chicken sandwich was served with a very nice roll and not too wet cole slaw. My pastrami sandwich was served hot and over running the roll. It was served with hot fries that were nicely seasoned. We shall be back."}
{"text":"Loved the Phyllo appetizer. It was unique, flavorful, and not too heavy, with just the right kick. The deserts were good too, and love that you can get a small size portion. My friend ordered the peach cobbler, and I ordered the peanut butter pretzel pie. I loved the salty sweet combo.  The chocolate mousse portion wad a little too sweet (at least for me), but I really liked the pretzel crust. Overall, it's a good  spot to hit for lunch."}
{"text":"I've only ever got take out from here but the service always seems super friendly! I got the cheesesteak sandwich.....it was heavenly!!! So, I guess they make their own bread and it is fantastic, the only thing I wish was different is that the bread had a little more substance to it because my sandwich was kind of soggy when I got home, but other than that it was sooooooo yummy!"}
{"text":"I have lived in AZ since I was little and I have always loved coming here. I always order the Chile Verde Birdie Turkey sandwich (to die for if you put avocado on the top). 

I had the assistant manager, Ben, take care of me and he was great! The manager even came by and asked how everything was doing. 

My friends and I went there for a happy hour special and they overcharged her for her appetizer (the new waiter who rung our check made an error) but we weren't upset, just confused about the price. Ben came right back and gave her a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert! 

Food was a little spicier than normal the day I went, but I love them nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Great food with extensive menu, something for everyone.  I had a great cheese steak, wife had prickly pear marinated chicken salad.  Bread pudding is very good and Alyssa is a sweetheart."}
{"text":"We were in here on 6/22/14. Food was great however the waitress seemed to have a bad attitude. That made the whole dining experience not that pleasant. We will return just will check our waitstaff before seating. 

Thanks...
Jake E"}
{"text":"The food and service were top notch. I had the pastrami with Hatch green chili and the prickly pear vodka lemonade."}
{"text":"Ended up here randomly while looking for someplace new to eat. We ordered something involving a lion and a turkey something sandwich--both were delicious! Staff was nice and they had homemade lemonade to boot. 
Appetizers, salads, and desserts sounded tasty too--will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This was a tough decision. I was debating between a 3 and 4, since half stars are not allowed, and ultimately decided on a mid grade. As it was my 1st experience I do plan on visiting again to see if the outcome is different. 

The most impressive aspect of the restaurant is how friendly and accommodating everyone is! From the minute you walk in you are warmly greeted by, well, everyone! The hostess, the manager, staff walking by, all smile and take a second to say hello! The waitress promptly arrived after being seated and again, a smile and a hello followed by drink orders. You truly feel welcomed!

The place reminded me of a Jersey diner without the employee attitude. Casual but clean, sedated but a lively crowd. Menu was decent enough offering a wide variety of items without being overwhelming. I decided to go with a late breakfast and ordered eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. Unfortunately it was very disappointing. The eggs were heavily under cooked with a lot of clear egg-white showing. Seriously, why serve that? But it didn't end there. The toast is really a great looking baguette. However, mine was so drenched in butter that the toast was actually soggy and ripping oil. Potatoes were decent but the bacon was subpar. A generous portion of thick bacon with some cold, some hot, most over cooked and dry. No consistency and definitely not tasty! I tried eating around the uncooked or bad parts, but not enough. 

At least the waitress was kind enough to check in and when I told her what was going on, she promptly offered a redo or a different dish. I chose a half sandwich and soup. 

In the meantime the manager did come over to say hello and apologize for the other plate and reassured me that it would be taken care of. 

This time, the outcome was much different, but not impressive. The soup was delicious! The thyme chicken sandwich tasted as if it had been soaked in vinegar. Tried a few bites of the chicken (didn't have the bread cause it had mayo on it - though the menu or waitress didn't say so), and the vinegar was just too overpowering to taste good. 

I ate my soup, move the chicken around and asked for my check. Tipped well and left.  Oh, before I forget, I must mention the restroom. There is a leak from the urinal. Staff/management are obviously aware as there was a mop there and a pattern showing water being mopped to a corner. However, the leak occurs when you flush the urinal so you are getting urine on the floor and people stepping on it! Gross! Close the urinal down and fix it! That is probably the deciding factor between a 3 or 4 star rating.."}
{"text":"I love flancer's! It has great food and tons of options. I love their sandwiches especially- my favorite is the prickly pear chicken sandwich it's super yummy! Their fries are also super good!"}
{"text":"Had this for the first time today delivered via door dash. I ordered the Philly with the green chili Mac as my side. I think this would be much better eaten at the restaurant. I was anticipating that crusty bread but sadly it was soggy by the time it got here. This is not the restaurants fault. I've had this happen before with takeout. I ate it anyway and the filling was pretty good though I did have to add a little salt. The Mac and cheese was just ok. I'd definitely try again but next time eating in!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is a new addition to Flancer's already impressive repertoire. I had the biscuits and gravy, and it was on point. And I'm a b&g snob. I can't wait to try some of the more exotic morning fare. Currently breakfast is only being offered Fri-Sun. 

If you make it in for lunch or dinner, be sure to get a side of the green chili mac and cheese. 

Always friendly service as well. Super laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food. We had an Italian hoagie with green chili mac and cheese, and a filet. Quite the mix of dishes. The steak was a little more interesting, with a tomato/onion sauce on it, than we were probably looking for but the hoagie and mac and cheese was definitely comfort food. Restaurant was clean and the staff was personable, attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back but probably to try the breakfast."}
{"text":"The staff was super nice and helpful, the food was good, although I expected the choices to be better considering all the hype and the location being so close to downtown Gilbert. 

With the price I don't think we will be returning, as it just wasn't our thing, as we are trying to fing unique places to eat. But, it was a cute sandwich shop, with decent food."}
{"text":"I'm very torn on this place. The food is definitely good- I particularly enjoy the prickle pear chicken sandwich. The ambience is great, it's priced what I would expect , etc.
But the last few times I've been, the service is awful. It just seems to give you the impression that no one is in charge. And my most recent visit was to pick up food I pre-ordered. I was told 15-20 minutes. I showed at about the 20 minute mark, and proceeded to wait 15 more minutes for my food. All the while people were running around chaotically.
So would I recommend it? Yes. But I'd do it with a warning."}
{"text":"We are big fans of this restaurant, although we usually go to the Mesa location. Since we were meeting friends from Gilbert for dinner, we decided to try out the Gilbert location. 

We got there about 6pm on a Sunday night. They were busy, but did not look packed. Even with a party of 6, we were seated within 15 minutes. We had a friend waitress, and she quickly took or order and got drinks. My friend noticed that the menu called out draft, so he asked about beers on tap. We were told that only the Mesa has beer on tap. =( We decided to order a kids mac & cheese, two different pizza's, a burger, and a salad. We were told that the pizza's took about 25 minutes, and that was fine, since we had ordered a salad as an appetizer. 

Now...the waiting began...about 30 minutes after we were there, the waitress came back to tell us that the kitchen was out of the hatch green chile that goes on their \"The Match with Hatch\" burger. My friend loves spicy food, so was disappointed on this and said to do jalapenos instead. We asked if the food was in process, and was told that it was and they would come back with an estimate. Around 45 minutes, the kids meal, salad, and burger showed up, followed very quickly by 1 of the 2 pizzas. The wagon wheel spinach salad was its typical tasty self. Typically my child LOVES the mac & cheese from here, and dives in. This time, it took a lot of encouragement to get her to eat it. It was a lot drier than usual and didn't seem to have the same cheesy flavor compared to what she usually has at the Mesa location. I typically love their pizza's; however, the Veg Out that we ordered was not up to the usual quality. My 1st slice was burned black on the bottom and tasted burned. At least only 1/2 of the pizza was burned. Our friends told us that their pizza wasn't like what they usually get back in Chicago, but described it as \"edible\" so I wasn't sure if that was their way of saying that they didn't like it?

The waitress did appologize for the slow service and issues. She did also give us a discount to make up for the long wait times. My impression was that something was off the night of the May 4th for dinner service. I wondered if they were short staffed? We've never had that slow of service at Flancer's or such unimpressive  food. I doubt that I will be able to talk my Chicago friends into giving them another try. =(

This being said, I really hope that this isn't typical for Gilbert location, and that we just caught them on a bad night. We've always loved the service and great food from Mesa."}
{"text":"It was alright. The encrusted goat cheese medallions in the goat cheese salad had way too much breading and it made them very dry, and they didn't taste like goat cheese at all. I have had encrusted goat cheese medallions at several places that were DELICIOUS, but these were not really good at all, although, you get about five medallions on the salad.  That's a lot!!! I'd rather have three medallions and have them not skimp on the goat cheese and leave out the breading. The rest of the salad was ok. They have good coke products, so I would come back again and try something more savory and with bread next time since they make their own bread.  My three girlfriends had sandwiches (one had the prickly pear chicken and loved it) The other girls loved their food too.  The atmosphere was nice, the waitress was very nice and the manager stopped by to see how we were doing.  I'd give it another whirl."}
{"text":"First time here.  There were 3 in our party and we had penne w/marinara and meat sauce,  cheese steak sandwich, and cheese fondue with shrimp.  The only somewhat negative comment was the cheese steak sandwich had too many onions and not enough cheese.  The penne was great and the dip was amazing.  We will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Can't beat flancers. Always get the the chicken and potato Patty. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Discovered tonight green chili mustard that you can sun for the green chili mayo. Seriously yum. Salads, sandwiches, soups, & pizza are all super good. Awesome Balsam is favorite salad. Green chili soup is amazing. Chili Verde birdie is another favorite. Has gluten free offering too."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised on the quality of the food taste freshness definitely will repeat our visit again thank you very much"}
{"text":"The truth on Flancer's? 

Ok... here goes.

So, I'm a bit of a Travel channel fanatic. I love watching it and imagining what it's like traveling around the world, from restaurant to restaurant, enjoying some of the best food in the world. As a direct result, I suppose, I'm a bit of a food critic myself. I'm also a chef. So what does this have to do with Flancer's?

Well, as you arrive at Flancer's, located near Gilbert and Guadalupe, you immediately notice the packed parking lot, bustling patio and the modest presentation of the small building; your destination. 

Flancer's immediate visual impact resembles many town favorites, gems in the rough - small, unimposing, perhaps underestimated but certainly welcoming. As you walk through the often crowded set of glass double doors, to the interior of the restaurant, the staff is immediately friendly and helpful. Everyone is observed to be working hard and all with smiles on their faces. Seating is likely to be immediate, however as you may be waiting for a brief moment in the small area available to the ever-present to-go customers, you should take the time to glance into the kitchen, which is directly ahead. It is clean and the energy of the restaurant is matched by the hustle and bustle of the kitchen staff - baking fresh bread, cooking fresh pasta and slicing freshly cooked meats for their award winning sandwiches.

After being sat, the server is always prompt and welcoming. He will often immediately take your drink order and ask about an appetizer, give you some silverware and return promptly with the first round. Never imposing but always helpful, the server recommends the items of the day and gives you time to contemplate your order. The menu was recently downsized from a larger menu, which I found to be a good idea. I'd been here many times, but did often feel as if I was navigating the Sahara at times!

I of course, have not had every item on the menu, and do not plan on it. However, what I can recommend to you are these items: The Prickly Pear Sandwich, We Must Meat, I Ain't Lion Sandwich, Roma on the Range Sandwich, The Chipotle Pasta, Goat Cheese Bruschetta, Oven Roasted Garlic Parmesan bread (without the marinara, served on the side, I believe it to be just fine without it), Awesome Balsam Salad and you can't go wrong with the beer battered french fries! All of these items I have had on more than one occasion and I can promise you that you will not be disappointed with them. Maybe some day I will branch out, and try one of the other selections available at Flancer's, but I'm not sure if anything else on the menu will come close to how good these dishes are, haha.

So in conclusion, whether you're on a business meeting or a Sunday lunch with friends or family, Flancer's offers healthy, delicious and decadent options to people from all walks of life. The American and Italian fusion provided by Flancer's in sandwich form, is seen all over the world, but no one in the Phoenix area does it better and that my friends, is all you really need to know."}
{"text":"Anytime I go to Flancer's Cafe I order the Prickly Pear Chicken Sandwich. The chicken is always very moist and the marinade tastes awesome. What really makes this sandwich great is that it also comes on very soft roll. They also put this New Mexican green chile mayonnaise on it which tastes great. 
This sandwich keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"The renovation has served this location well. I didn't feel like I was sitting on someone's lap like the first time I wandered in. Great neighborhood joint for lunch or dinner. Ya gotta try the Prickly Pear Chicken once in your life."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!  SOOOO good!!!  Philly cheesesteak was fantastic - moist, meaty, and the bread was the right amount of soft with crusty ciabatta top - yummy!!  The green chili and Mac-n-cheese awesome!  Pastrami was right on target with hot peppers and hot mustard!!  Fried mashed potato with chilies was a little bland but just a tiny bit of salt fixed that right up!
Cool, relaxed atmosphere, attentive and friendly waiting staff. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"After 3 or 4 trips to Flancers, I'm convinced it's one of the best \"mom and pop\" places in the EV. Great sandwiches and Pizza, and the limited selection of Alcohol actually keeps things authentic. Sit back with your friends and enjoy the ambiance"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots. Prickly Pear Chicken Caesar Salad is worth the journey."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Gilbert! Every time I go I get a sandwich and salad! Favorite's include; 'We must meat I ain't Lion,' 'Prickly pear chicken', and 'Chile Verde birdie (add bacon and avo)' Haven't ventured through the rest of the menu too much. Goat Cheese Brushetta is mouthwatering. Also, the sweet potato fries are great!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. The food is great my fav sandwich is the Ace of Clubs. It's a must have."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, the service and food were excellent.  Wife had a salad, I had the club and you could tell the ingredients were high quality and the food was well prepared."}
{"text":"Flancers is a great restaurant good food and Ben is a great waiter. The awesome balsalm salad is highly recommended"}
{"text":"anything with that green chile mayo is crack in your mouth. so good!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very fresh food even though I made a special request they didn't charge extra. I yelped vegetarian/vegan which this place has about 2-3 option only. Veggie wrap and added hummus was great and French fries perfect. I'd come back again if on this side of town. Open one in Peoria and I'll visit frequently. Looks like have happy hours, not sure of specials and live music. Maybe another salad    option or black bean/veggie burger option to substitute. Other than that check it out"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times in the past but not in years.  The other day I stopped in to grab lunch at 1:20pm and was put on a wait list 5 groups long.  The most frustrating part was that their were 5 tables open inside and a full open patio outside.  The cooks were twiddling their thumbs with nothing to do and there were easily 4 employees total just kinda hanging out.  I waited 15 minutes thinking there had to be a reason we couldn't sit in these empty tables and at least sip on an ice tea... but there was not, or at least no one explained to us why all of us were standing inside and out waiting to be seated.

I finally left at 1:37 because I had an appt. I had to be at by 2pm.  I remember the food being decent but i was very disappointed in the lack of concern from the staff that day."}
{"text":"As a Mesa native that has since moved away, my family never misses an opportunity to go to Flancer's when we return. Excellent service with a really unique twist on The flavor a of the southwest. 

Prickly Pear Chicken is out of this world. Prickly ear anything is killer! The lemonade is great as well. Green chili mayo, green chili Mac and cheese, and outstanding fries really add to the experience as well. Homemade bread for sandwiches are off of the charts. The upside to this place is endless. Super casual environment and delicious.

I had been here many times and it is one of the few places that I can honestly say, of the many times I have returned I have never had anything but an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Awesome little place just down the street from our house. Friends recommended it so we were anxious to try it. We weren't disappointed. I had the Cubano On the Run Cubano and my wife had Hoagie & Bacall Italian. Both sandwiches were very good. I've seen complaints about portion sizes but I felt it was just right. My side was the Green Chile mac & cheese. It was fantastic!! Everyone raves about the Perfect \"Prickly\" Pear Chicken, that and pizza are on our list for the next visit. Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Flancer's is excellent. I have yet to have a bad dish there. If I were to have one complaint about Flancer's it would be it's popularity. It is completely common to pull into the parking lot and see all walks of life sitting outside waiting for their name to be called. It's not a large establishment!

I ordered the Chili Verde Birdie sandwich which \"rocked the ole' taste buds!\" The pizzas are also not to be missed! Service is great and the ambiance is quite upbeat!

Funny story, I was FB'ing with a friend and I had mentioned I was on my way to Flancer's for my first visit. Upon getting there, the manager (Jimmy) asked if I was the guy on Facebook chatting them up. Ultimately, Jimmy gave me a card for 15% off my next visit as a thank you! Now that's service!"}
{"text":"A find. That local place you love to discover, Delicious food, very reasonably priced and not the same old same old. Service was prompt and friendly
I can't wait to sample the other location also. We'll be regulars"}
{"text":"I enjoed the Gilbert Rd location and this 1 did not disappoint. Homemade bread and wraps cover fresh sandwiches.Try the mushroom phyllo appetizer. Sandwiches burgers and pizza but higher quality. Excellent healthy choices including a GREAT veggie wrap. Service very friendly"}
{"text":"Great Food! They pretty much just do sandwiches and thats totally fine because they rock at it. They have the best bread which makes everything that much better. Good service, good crowd, and the price is great too. They make a southwest philly cheese steak w/ green chili added on top for extra that will make you smile with joy. Seriously....."}
{"text":"My first experience with Flancer's was very positive. We ordered the cheesesteak, and it was very good. This time, I called in an order for pick up for the We Must Meat, I Ain't Lion Filet Mignon and the Perfect Prickly Pear Chicken sandwich. They were both sloppily prepared. Both sandwiches were also missing ingredients. I was also disappointed by how I was approached by Greg. He assumed that I worked for DoorDash when I came in to pick up my order and told me that I needed to wait my turn. I hope to be greeted in a more respectful way if I order from here again."}
{"text":"Good service and helpful recommendations.  A little pricey,  but they do have some unique options! There are several items made with prickly pear,  and you've GOT to try the side of cheddar jalapeno potato pie!!"}
{"text":"First....we LOVE Flancers, one of our top picks for everyday dining. BUT, we were very disappointed in our Thanksgiving dinner to go.  Awful does not even come close.  Turkey - overdone with no flavor, tasted previously frozen pre-cut and pre-cooked.  Potatoes - the garlic was so strong it overpowered everything else.  Orange-Cranberry sauce - way too much orange.  Gravy - thick brown liquid with no flavor.  Beans - where were the green chili's?  Th only decent item was the dressing although fairly bland and we did not taste the \"sage\".  A \"roasted tomato\" - seriously?  It was an unripened tomato with progresso crumbs thrown on top and baked.  Awful doesn't even come close here...and this acid combined with the relish and garlic potatoes...yuk!  Pumpkin pie....flavorless.  Not sure what happened since the reviews for holiday meals were all excellent.  And, it was almost twice as much as it's competitors...$20 per meal!  Never again!"}
{"text":"I went back two times after they hard covered the patio and was disappointed.  The first thing that I noticed was the green chili, bacon and cheese fries were removed from the menu.  What what what?  The portions got smaller too and many other items were removed from the menu.  The service remained excellent but why they changed a great formula remains a mystery for me.  Sad to see a place \"have it\" then start to lose it."}
{"text":"This is the only place I come to for pizza! I'm more of a burger girl than pizza but the goat cheese they offer is really different. If you've never had it I recommend trying it at least once. I only am scoring them a 3 and not a 5 simply bcoz they rarely have pesto but they actually have the BEST PESTO IN TOWN! Let's keep ordering it so they keep making it and having it on hand every time."}
{"text":"yea I am a real big fan. This place makes their own bread and if you love a good sandwich you know that is the most important thing.... they nailed it. The prickly pear sandwich is really good. Be sure to get some extra green chili mayo to go on it. I get the fries with it because they are super crispy (even after driving home with them in the to-go container). I would very highly recommend Flancers for something different and delicious."}
{"text":"Sorry to rain on this one, but I was very disappointed by my meal.  I'll do anything to avoid chains, so this place really sounded good ... but it was not to be. 

 I LOVE Bruschetta, but their bruschetta was disappointing.  The bread was nothing special, and there was a lack of good tomato/basil on top.  There was a big dollop of goat cheese, which sounded good on the menu, but ended up not contributing much.  My steak salad was not bad (the grilled steak was good quality, and nicely cooked - something many places get wrong) but the croutons were the typical pathetic specimen you'd expect at Denny's.  

Overall, I found the menu confusing and the descriptions unappetizing. For example, there's a 'pasta' section, with this entry: \"Love me Tender ... 
Filet mignon, in gorgonzola cream sauce with spinach, mushrooms, green onions and roasted red bell peppers\"   Now - how does a 'filet mignon' end up as a pasta dish? Is the pasta on the side? Is the filet all chopped up and tossed in with the pasta?  Beats me!  And the photos on the menu don't have captions so you have no idea which dish they are portraying."}
{"text":"It seems like we go to Flancers every week now!  They really have a great menu, friendly staff and nice atmosphere.  My 4 year old son loves to enter into the coloring contest and the childrens portions are generous, a perfect place to take your kids.

On our last visit, my wife and I split a fish sandwich, and  a half salad half chili verde birdie.. yum!  

Just a great place, if you are out in the east valley/Mesa, you have to find Flancers and give them a try.. you'll be back."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed tonight.  I have been going to Flancers with my family for so long, almost once a week.  I remember when my son was young and we would come in to see if he won the coloring contest, but tonight... well I don't think I will be back.  We got there about 5:30pm on a Friday night, and it was a little busier than normal.. I am guessing because the winter visitors are back.  We sat down right away at a table rather than a booth because all of the booths were full.  It took awhile for our waitress to come to the table and when she did.. she told us \"I had to go in the back to wash some appetizer dishes because we ran out\" ... no big deal, it happens.. and she came back to take our order.. but our table was right by the front door and more and more people came in, each one opening the door and it was drafty.. so I asked the hostess.. if there was anyway we could move to a booth since when one was available.. she first said.. \"which one?\" and I said.. well the first one.. she said, she already had people waiting.. sure I understand.. but we did get there, before those that were waiting and if they wanted a table, they could have ours... and we had not even ordered, we could have gotten up and left, but I thought she was going to do something about it.. or at least acknowledge my request and say no.. but instead.. I saw her talking to the waitress, who pointed over to us.. pointed at the booth and as she came by the table I said.. \"never mind, we don't want to cause a fuss\"  And.. she said, rather rudely.. \"I don't know what you are talking about!.. what do you mean never mind?\"  not friendly, not making any sense.. if she didn't know what was going on, why did she have that reaction, it felt like she got caught telling the hostess to forget about ... So.. others came and sat in the booths.. and we got our food.. but we didn't' see our server much after that.. I asked her to refill my son's lemonade.. she grabbed it and eventually brought it back.

Later, she seemed like nothing happened.. back to the faux friendliness.. which now made me feel worse.. I started to realize that after all these times that we had visited this place.. almost a little family tradition.. I did not want to come back.  It took forever for our ice tea to ever get refilled.. the manager came by and cleared the plates and didn't ask.. \"how was everything.?\"  because I am sure he knew by then that we were upset.. but that it didn't really matter to him.. hey, they were busy.  

I am sure that they will remain busy... the winter visitors will keep them busy for now.. but this customer that used to come every week with his family won't be back.  The food is ok.. but it's not the only place around.

I realized tonight that the people there, are different, or should I say indifferent to how the customer feels.. that isn't the same manager that used to be here and truly seemed to care how we enjoyed our meal.. these are not the same servers that had been there in the past that had a smile on their face when they greeted you.  This has become your average cafe.. and if you are a frequent visitor like we were.. I challenge you to look around.. are you going here because you always have?  isn't it different now?

To be honest it's a little sad.. this used to be a little family tradition.. when we didn't know what we wanted for dinner.. we would always say.. well let's just go to Flancers,but that's done.

Goodbye Flancers"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  It's just north of the Gilbert downtown area so if you don't like the congestion downtown give this place a try. 

The staff is super friendly and very attentive.  They make you feel welcomed. 

The goat cheese brucheta and any prickly pear entree are my favorites."}
{"text":"We've been to Flancers many times and its always been great.  Its hard not to get the Philly Cheese-steak as it is *perfection*, but we've loved everything else we've ordered there too.  The place is very down to earth and could do with a makeover, but overall we really like it.  The staff is friendly and do a great job overall."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Awesome. :) 
This is like the trifecta of awesome little cafes. The food is amazing, the staff is super friendly, and the atmosphere is great. You can't lose!
I HIGHLY suggest the \"Goat to Have It\" salad, if you're into that kind of thing. It's pretty much heaven. They also have incredible sandwiches and... Da-Da-Da-DAAA!!! They serve KIltlifter!!! :) 
This place is fantastic and you need to try it over and over. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been huge fans of Flancer's for a long time and were excited to try out the new breakfast menu. It was hard to decide as everything sounded amazing, but we finally settled on The Standard and the Smothered Breakfast Burrito.  The green chile was spicy and flavorful - perfection!  For the price, the portions seemed on the small side (particularly the burrito), but everything was delicious.  Going forward, I think we'll stick to our favorites on the lunch menu - you can never go wrong with the Chile Verde Birdie Turkey. I can't get enough of their homemade bread with the green chile mayo - yum!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The sandwiches are amazing and they bake the bread there. The jalepeno cheddar mashed potato thing is mmmmmm."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since it opened. Tasty, not too pricey and unique food. However on my most recent visit I have to admit that the sandwich I ordered appeared to be much smaller than it had been in the past. I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak, but really the same thing from Subway gives you ore meat at half the price. 

Hopefully this was just type of fluke and I will give them a second chance, but if not I really don't think I will spend the money when I can get a better value at Subway."}
{"text":"They make the best sandwiches.  The Prickly Pear Chicken sandwich is definitely my favorite!  I also love their sweet potato fries.  In the past I've had their green chile mac and cheese and was disappointed.   It was really greasy and had hardly any cheese.  The Philly Cheese Steak sandwich is also amazing.  Definitely get the extra toppings on that one.  Their pizza is ok, not great.  I'd stick with one of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Despite the decent atmosphere and not too terrible location we get sat at one of the greasiest tables I've seen in a long time. We order appetizers and they come posthaste. Good, but not worth 10$ a plate good... Then comes the pink prickly pear chicken :/ poor execution at a great recipe. The goat cheese bruschetta was OK but slightly disappointing. If you want a 50$ tab for a few drink+ appetizers and 1 entree i suggest you go somewhere else. Oh and don't even think about giving them a bad yelp review, the owner will put a plaque on the wall for anyone that takes the time to write about how disappointing the food is. Guy can't take a hint."}
{"text":"Don't listen to any naysayers, this is a good, local restaurant. I like it because every time I eat there, I can get something different and it always hits the spot. The Philly sandwich is tasty, as well as the prickly pear chicken one. Finally tried the pizza and wings and those are great too. Service has always been great and have never had a problem here."}
{"text":"I went once, just to try this famous Chile Verde Birdie or something like that. And it turned out to be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. 

We've been back. And plan to keep doing so. If it had a nice outdoor patio, it would be perfect. 

Definitely one of our favorite neighborhood joints."}
{"text":"Yum! I get the same thing every time. The \"Prickly pear sandwich\" and sweet potato fries. It's so good I never tried anything else! Definitely recommend both locations."}
{"text":"A vendor we were visiting in Tempe/Mesa had Philly sandwiches delivered from Flancer's.  Seriously, probably the best sandwich I've had in a long time and definitely several orders of magnitude better than Subway, Quiznos, or some other national sandwich chain."}
{"text":"This is ONLY about their wings, and I've heard that everything else on their menu is fine, though I've had several people tell me that this place is racist, unsolicited.

And trust me, we wish we never came here.  Their wings were the absolute worst wings I've ever had, it was a nightmare of wing-eating and the absolute nadir for our site.  We've been to shitholes and dives and crackdens in search of wings, but the worst ones were right here at Flancers.  

We wrote a review and apparently some people weren't too happy with it and kept telling us their sandwiches were great, but we didn't give a shit.  We didn't review a sandwich, we reviewed barely-edible wings."}
{"text":"Good food.  Attentive and friendly server and super accommodating for the kids!  We find that the specials are sometimes smaller portions than expected but the regular menu is great."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the cheese steak sandwich and fries. Fun little family place with lots of repeat fans.  I know tons of people who make this their regular date night stop. Good pricing, great food, and the staff is always very helpful. I highly recommend you give them a try!"}
{"text":"The prickly pear chicken is absolutely amazing! I order this sandwich every time I go here and it is perfect every time. I have been going here for years but still continue to order the same sandwich because of how amazing it is!"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Flancer's Gilbert location when we lived near them, so was excited to find they had opened a second location much closer to our new place.

Still one of the best, tastiest sandwiches (and pizza!) around, their new location doesn't feel as \"quaint\" as their original location, but that might be what they were shooting for.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Always love to see a great local business expand!"}
{"text":"first time trying this restaurant. purchased a pepperoni pizza, and it was very delicious, and tasted fresh. love the thin crust. didn't expect to like it as much as i did. would come again"}
{"text":"the service was horrible!. We walked in & they looked at us like we were from another planet. One guy (the cook) couldn't help not taking his eyes off us which was very uncomfortable. No one said anything to us for a couple of minutes not a hello or anything. Finally a female host came & sat us. I will say she was the only polite, warm & friendly person in there to us. We couldn't help but notice the service others were getting around us. It seems to me they were a bit more friendly to other guest. On our way out we did not get a thank you, goodbye or please come again. RUDE RUDE RUDE!! 

The my fries were cold & hard."}
{"text":"So it's been almost a year exactly since I first tried Flancer's and have been back several times. 

This time it was my choice for my bday dinner and so it was me and my fiance dining. And lo and behold it was time for the pot roast sandwich special again. Had to have it, loved it as much as last year. 

Rushing ahead though. I have never had Flancer's pizza so rather than do a regular appetizer, I had a slice of cheese pizza. The crust was perfect. Heck, the whole slice was perfect. Definitely must order a whole pie at some point. 

Fiance ordered the green chile bacon cheddar fries for an appetizer. So decadent and good. An instant favorite. 

Back to the pot roast sandwich. You can't beat tender pot roast with cabbage and crunchy thin pieces of onion on Flancer's bread. I had sweet potato fries this time and they are just as good as the regular fries. 

Fiance had the baked chipotle fettuccine, which has become a favorite for him. As good as ever though he said next time he's trying something else just because all of their food is so good. 

I'd signed up for Flancer's email club and had an email for a free cobbler dessert since it was my bday. It was strawberry/apple cobbler and again, perfection. Not too sweet so that eating it with the delicious vanilla bean ice cream was just right. 

And to make our night even better, even though we didn't have a party of 4 that would have gotten us a free appetizer too, our server talked to the manager and they gave me my pizza slice free because we had such a good order. (Ordering a bunch of food finally paid off. Yes!) 

Bottom line, I just love Flancer's. The service is always great, the staff is so friendly and the food is incomparable. 

Well done, Flancer's. Well done."}
{"text":"They have great food options!  Their bread is phenomenal, but I love their salads most of all.  And their gluten free pizza crust is the best I have ever had!  it tastes better then regular crusts at most places.  We have gone there regularly for the past year & have never had bad food or service!  Flancer's rocks!"}
{"text":"I work close to Flancer's, so it was one of the first places I tried when I moved to Gilbert. Except perhaps the thickness of their balsamic dressing, which was loved by the other people I've gone there with, I have really enjoyed everything I've eaten so far: salads, burgers, and pizza. Everything was subtly balanced and fresh. My favorite is the steak tip salad. The meat is tender and the bread yummy."}
{"text":"This is my family's new 'best breakfast' destination on the weekends!  Breakfast entrees are unique & absolutely out of this world! The biscuits & gravy is so good you'll be tempted to cry!!
Down home  local place & the service is also top notch!  Kudos to Greg & team!"}
{"text":"Our neighbor just began cooking here so we thought we'd give it a try and I'm glad we did! When we first walked in the door the place felt very homey & welcoming. The service was good and the food was delicious. I definitely recommend this place and we will certainly be back. Thanks for the recommendation, Chef Anthony!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! It's small, but quirky. We had the 1/2 tuna and side of jalepeno cheddar potatoes, and it was great.
We also had the \"its about thyme\" chicken sandwich 1/2 with the wedge salad.  Holy crap that was good!  Also split a slice of pizza.  We got the \"goat to have it.\" That was pretty much one of the best pieces of pizza I've ever had.  The goat cheese made that pizza like heaven.  Only found this place thanks to Groupon, but its a new favorite now!!!"}
{"text":"The prickle pear chicken sandwich is awesome. I love the genuine service and not having a long wait time. Price was good too. I will return soon. Try the apple cinnamon bread pudding with brown pecans. It's to die for."}
{"text":"This place has decent food, cute atmosphere, but the service is problematic. I was stuck in Mesa for training and had lunch there on Halloween. My pal and I ordered lunch and about 20 minutes later it arrived, minus the condiments we ordered earlier. Sadly our server was no where to be found, and then when she finally checked on us, I asked again for ranch, and she said sure- like it was the first time she heard the request. Another ten minutes passed and finally she remembers the ranch and brings it by. At this point the fries were cold, so it was kinda pointless. I understand this is merely WPP, but most other places can figure it out, so maybe this spot can up their game."}
{"text":"VERY SLOW. Service was slow for a Monday. Our order was over 30 min to hit the table. Way over priced and under delivered on the signature salad. The kids meals where great portions, but still on the higher priced side. 

Two stars cause they are local and not a corp store:.:"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Saturday evening. Smaller spot, but the food and service were good. I got the open faced green Chile turkey sandwich which was scrumptious. I would go back."}
{"text":"Food may be good but don't come here hungry. $13 for a sandwich that would be on a kiddie menu anywhere else is what I got. No thanks... A 6 inch sub at subway is bigger then the whole sandwich from this place.."}
{"text":"The sandwiches at Flancers are some of the best in Gilbert.  I have tried so many and keep going back to try more and every single one so far is excellent.  Great place."}
{"text":"Food is not worth the price or the wait.  Not sure of the attraction - noisy, cramped quarters and EXPENSIVE.  My husband and myself will not go again."}
{"text":"We have eaten here weekly for years, and the food, the service, and the friendliness of everyone always makes it a memorable experience. I could recommend so many superb meals, but I won't write the whole menu.  Anything you chose will be above your culinary 
Expectations!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my wife, the food and service were both fantastic. Our server Christopher was very pleasant and made sure everything was to our liking. We have been coming to this location for years and always have a good experience.
The one thing that puzzles me about Flancers is, why the the location on Gilbert Rd is so much better than the location on Higley in east Mesa? I find the food and service at that location to be of far less quality the few times we have tried it.  I will continue to frequent the Gilbert location but, can not recommend the one in Mesa."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  If you want a great local lunch spot, this is it.  I have never had a bad meal here, and I've tried at least half the items on their very diverse menu!  My favorite is of course the prickly pear chicken sandwich.  But their pizzas are great too, and their pastas, and the green chili mushroom phyllos...  It definitely gets busy during the lunch hour, and finding a parking spot can get tricky, but even when they're busy I've never had to wait too long for a table.  Staff is super friendly and on the ball, and it seems like the owner (or manager? I'm not sure) is always there making sure things run smoothly and helping out when needed.  On holidays, they offer pre-prepared multi-course meals that you can take home.  My husband and I did this for Valentine's day.  The meals come with simple instructions for putting the finishing touches at home so the food will be fresh and ready.  It was quite easy to do and the meal turned out perfectly, with none of the time and mess associated with cooking an elaborate meal."}
{"text":"Okay, we drive here from Scottsdale to eat lunch....it's fab! 
Homemade EVERYTHING, including the bread they use on their sandwiches. I've been meaning to try the salads for a couple of years, but can't get past the delish sandwiches, which are consistently perfect!
This place gets crowded (remember what they say about a good restaurant and a wait)  but is worth every minute of a wait. I only wish they would open a Scottsdale location, but driving to Gilbert is worth it to eat here. 
The wait staff is very friendly and they get your food to you the second it comes up, so it's super fresh. 
Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I love their Philly cheesesteaks. The one thing that would make them better is if you had the option of Cheez Whiz. Folks from Philly will tell you that a cheesesteak isn't a cheesesteak without it!!! The bread is fresh and the meat is tender a flavorful. Deeee-lish!!  The seasoned fries and most of the sandwiches are pretty darn good too. 

Great for lunch but you can't' be in a rush because there's always a wait."}
{"text":"Love this place...cool vibe, fresh breads, and unique options. So good."}
{"text":"Flancer's is a great place to grab a sandwich for lunch.  
Their BLT is the best around, seriously it is yummy, nice homemade bread, green chili mayo, crispy bacon!  Yummy.
They would be 4 stars but their service can me a bit slow, which isn't horrible unless you are in a hurry at lunch time (which we usually are) and their prices are a bit high for a quick lunch.  I wish they offered half sandwiches or some $6 lunch specials.  That would rock!"}
{"text":"OMG !! This place is so good. Well at least the Chili Verde Birdie is great. It's so good I never order anything else. I get it with bacon and avocado. Fresh bread that they bake and pulled turkey breast make this place unbeatable. One of the best sandwiches eva !!!!!
Oh yeah, my wife says the other food is pretty good also. Especially the BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado) !! 
Small place, can have a wait at times. Nice people , friendly servers. Consistently good food."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Gilbert one. I was really looking forward to the Ace of Club and side salad. Barely any of the Green Chile Mayo on my sandwich. The salad came with, maybe a tablespoon of dressing. Portions seemed smaller esp since the meal was $11.25. Good but the quality didn't seem as high as it was the last time I went to the Gilbert location."}
{"text":"Great food, nice selection on the menu. Perfect for people who have dietary restrictions such as gluten, vegetarian, vegan and yet still has great selection for those that eat everything. Service was very good.

Only reason it doesn't get 5-stars is the extreme lack of parking. Then to top it off, some dip-sh@! double parked an old beaten up Mercedes. Had to wait for someone to leave before we could park."}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea what everyone is so excited about.  We ate here last night and it was awful.  I will say that we did not order any of the sandwiches but we did order the garlic bread and a pizza. 

First the service was horrible - the hostess gave me attitude when I tried to ask her how long the wait would be and the waiting area is so tiny we had to continuously navigate the family around all of the serving traffic.

The garlic bread was awful, soggy, and did not contain even an ounce of real garlic but was liberally doused with garlic powder.  Honestly it tasted like they spread margarine on thin white bread and sprinkled it with garlic powder. Blah.

The pizza was so lacking in flavor I could have been eating toppings spread on plain tomato sauce on cardboard.

Paired with one soda the bill came out to $28.00 - as we left my husband joked and said we could have eaten five Little Cesar's pizzas for that price and it would  have tasted better. 

Needless to say we will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and amazing food. The only thing better is their happy hour! You can add green chilies to everything. Just an awesome place."}
{"text":"I agree with the yelper who said \"portions have shrunk and price has gone up\". The bread was really skinny this time. It's still good but for 10.00 for a half sandwhich and salad they won't be on my regular rotation anymore. There are good places around with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I keep lovin' this place the more I come back.  Maybe it helps that I bring my lovely wife and she's a fan now, too!  

We tend to go for dinner and get a pizza and salad.  The pizzas are great with a nice crispy crust, which has never been soggy no matter how many toppings were on it.  That's better than some bigshot pizzerias I've been to...and I LOVE my pizza.  What I really like is some of the toppings you don't find at many other pizzerias: sun-dried tomatoes, gorgonzola cheese.  We've got them with both and they taste great, although the sun-dried tomatoes keep falling off the pizza.

The different salads are unique and flavorful.  \"Goat to Have It\" with the warm, breaded goat cheese is a winner, as is the \"Spinach Wheel\" with the warm, soft pieces of apple.

Recently they had a special dessert for charity which was a coconut lemon ricotta cheesecake with macaroon crust.  One of their other desserts was a peach cobbler.  As the server saw my wife and I were having trouble deciding, she solved the problem: \"I can bring out snack size servings of both.\"  Genius!  So we sampled both, which were quite yummy.  

Still finding the food, atmosphere, and the service excellent and homey.  Come on down!"}
{"text":"I have been many times for lunch and have always enjoyed the food.  I was surprised recently when I found they were open for breakfast.  We went in on Sunday morning and were pleased that there wasn't a big crowd.  There were a few things that made me suspect that breakfast service is new and still needs some time to work out the little kinks.  One of our party ordered decaf.  They didn't have any decaf ready so they had to make some up.  A little wait, but it was fresh.  We ordered some extra tortillas.  Again, a little wait, but hot and fresh.  The food was 5 star when we got it.  The servers hustled but may have been a bit overwhelmed.  Thank goodness it wasn't busier.  No complaints, and I think the ratings will be in the 4 to 5 star range once they get the little kinks worked out."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal here or poor service.  Always a great place to come and relax and enjoy yourself.  The food is all homemade and you can tell.  Prices are more than reasonable and you get great portions!  Check them out!"}
{"text":"On July 23rd my son and I went to Flancers.  We flew all the way from the Pacific Northwest and knew we needed to stop in for a sandwich.  The Prickly Pear sandwich was worth the flight and drive from the airport.  I'm sad we didn't try the fresh lemonade and will do that next time.  Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"I decided to treat myself after work to my favorite sandwich, the Chile Verde Birdie Turkey, so I ordered it to go. The girl who took my order asked if I wanted avocado and bacon, never mentioning there is an additional charge, so I got the avocado and sweet potato fries as my side. My order came to $15.94. I don't remember this sandwich costing this much but thought maybe the price increased or there was a take out charge. I was too tired after working to give it much more thought and placed a dollar in the tip jar. When I got home I opened the container and there was the delicious sandwich except there were 2 very small tomato slices, one on each half, and 2 tiny slivers of avocado on each half. Since I was not given an itemized receipt I looked at the online menu to find out I paid $2.50 for that small mouthful of avocado! And my order of fries were 1/2 the amount I would have gotten if I had eaten in. Because the girl did not tell me there was an additional charge, there was hardly any avocado or tomato on my sandwich, and the 1/2 order of fries, I gave this rating 3 stars. I will never order take out from this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive but for a good cause, a portion goes to charity. Some of the best fries I've had, fast and friendly service, and a twist on your normal burger. A great place to bring the whole family."}
{"text":"The prickly pear chicken sandwich, oh my God! So delicious. This place has great food. I always get the jalapeño and cheddar mashed potato pie as a side. If you like spicy food (really spicy) then you should definitely try the mashed potato pie. Sometimes I find myself craving the sandwich and potato pie combo. The service is pretty good. The place is clean and the people are friendly. Sometimes I just call ahead & get it to go. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Flancer's is amazing. The staff are amazing and the food is amazing. I can't think of a better place to go to for lunch [almost] every Saturday!! O:) 

Their sandwiches are a must have! I am a bit hooked on their prickly pear chicken sandwich, which I order....every. single. time! The chicken itself is delicious, it has a slight sweetness to it from the prickly pear marinade. Don't get me started on their fresh baked bread!! I try to eat healthier when we go out and I TRY to order the prickly pear chicken SALAD (no bread) but I cannot resist the bread! P.S. You can also get a free loaf of their bread if you check-in there on foursquare O:) I have also tried bites of many other sandwiches which my bf orders - they are ALL so good. They have amazing soups as well - they taste homemade and delicious! 

The staff are all so friendly, they are very knowledgeable of the menu and honest. They are another reason that brings me back here, nothing beats friendly service. The restaurant itself is very small but comfortable and lots of record albums covers on the wall to entertain you :)"}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is friendly.  The only reason they didn't get a 5 star review is because of the small waiting area.  It can get really crammed; especially in the summer time, when noone wants to be outside.  I really can't recommend any one particular item, because you can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"This was our first time back in over a year.  The place has had a much needed facelift and looks good.  Food as usual is great."}
{"text":"Wow what a surprise. I really like this place. I have driven by this place numerous times on my way to Oregano's, Postino's and Liberty Market. I finally decided to stop for takeout one day,  upon walking in I was greeted immediately by the Manager. He immediately put me at ease and allowed me time to review the menu for my takeout item (I was parked right in front in the order pickup spots that have a time limit). I told him was my first time in and he wanted to know what made me stop (as they track), he also gave me a15% discount for return visit. I brought my husband back that following Sunday. So for my takeout I ordered their Spinach salad, it was really good even 20 mins after they gave it to me. Upon our return I ordered the prickly pear chicken sandwich with the Mac and cheese as the side. The sandwich was awesome, the Mac and cheese was ok but I am particular (I liked that I could order a side to try it). My husband had the Italian sandwich, a little heavy handed on the banana peppers but they were easily removed. I just bought a groupon to Flancers, very happy I found  this place as there are a lot of things I want to try."}
{"text":"Great sandwich! I ordered the Cure Heaven Pastrami w/fries and it was fantastic. I called in my order to go but planned on eating it there if it wasn't to busy. I attempted this order due to my super short lunch break, it being my first time there as well as not knowing how long the ordering process would take. Man behind the counter \"R\" pretty much made my 1st experience at Flancer's weird and awkward by making a big deal and telling me \"I couldn't do that because it wasn't fair to other customers\" there was maybe 8 people in this place at about 1:00pm... So the lunch rush was over and the place was not at all packed. After some wheeling and dealing \"dad\" finally let me eat there... In the back.... Like a castaway... haha, No joke. If it wasn't for the food being so damn good I would have just crossed this place off my list of restaurants to try around my new job."}
{"text":"Green chili anything is awesome! I always go for chicken sandwich w/ green chili mayo. Been going there for years and can't ever order anything else. No need to when you go there for what you want. They now have 2 locations one in N Mesa is good but definitely not the original, watch out for snow birds!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give them a 4, even though I waffle around on this a little bit.  3....3.5....Some things Flancer's does very well, like their fresh bread....amazing!.....and that BLT.  Holy moley that was good!  Love the fresh avocado on that.  And awhile back I had a soup called beef poblano or something like that, and it was exceptional as well.  The Do You Feel Like I Fondue app was really tasty and rich, with green chiles, tender chicken, and lots of cheese, but I'm not sure how they call that fondue.  See the pic.  It's just a dip.

But then, there are the things that are not so good.  The baked potato soup we had last night was not good at all.  OK on the consistency of the soup, but it tasted like it was almost scorched and only had 3 small potatoes.  I don't know if the intention was to be more like a bisque, but usually when I have potato soup it has chucks of potato in it.  And I think the temp was too high, and/or ours came from the bottom of the pot, because it had a hint of a scorched flavor.  My husband ordered the veggie side with the BLT and it was over half onions.  We've had a soggy pizza from them before too.

I think they could improve their beer selection a little for marketing the fact that they have a good beer selection.  Usually it's a couple of local stand-bys and then they get something else on a rotating selection.  Last night it was New Belgium's Ranger IPA which we tried and was ok, but there are usually a limited number of choices.  To me if you're going to promote that you have a good beer selection you have a lot of choices.  You don't have to be Boulders on Broadway or Papago Brewing, but I don't know, maybe 8 or 10 would be nice instead of 4 or 5.  Shock Top is not a craft beer, and the choices of Bud Light, Coors Light, Miller Lite, and Michelob Ultra remind me of an old joke about what do having sex in a canoe and light beer have in common?   There's a prickly pear lemonade that's pretty good, but really, the only reason we went last night was to burn up a Groupon.  

I don't know how often I'd go back.  Right now the construction around Gilbert and Guadalupe is very annoying, but I don't hold that against the restaurant.  They just seem to be a little inconsistent and I don't like the claustrophobic feel of this location.  There also have always been a lot of loud kids when we have been there.  Maybe in the future I'll just get a BLT to go and be extremely happy with that."}
{"text":"Went there last night and got the Baked Chipotle Fettucini and the Two Tickets to Paradise Shrimp Sandwich.  This is the second time I have been there, and the second time it was just ok.  We went because we had a Groupon.  If you don't know what that is, you should check it out, Groupon.com.  Amazing deals here in Phoenix.  

Megan's pasta took a long time, so when we finally got our food, hers was very hot, and mine was barely warm, obviously had been sitting there for a good long while waiting for hers to get done.  I had a green chili mashed potato with my sandwich that was just a few degrees away from cold.  I ate it because I was hungry, but should have sent it back.  Shrimp on the sandwich had a really good flavor, but was also just a few degrees away from being cold. I expected the pasta to be spicy, but that's all it was, spicy.  Didn't really have much extra flavor but spicy.  Diet coke was good.  I have never had the pizza here, I have read that  it's really good.  If someone invites me here, we will get that, otherwise, I won't be back.  Cold food is a turnoff.  Kitchen should have planned better so food would have come out at the same time."}
{"text":"Tried the Cuban sandwich with the potato pie, ah-ma-zing. The Cuban was super flavorful and delicious and the potato pie was spicy and yummy. The lemonade was really good too."}
{"text":"These are the best sandwiches in Mesa. I've never had a bad experience here and the food is always terrific."}
{"text":"I went to both locations that Flancers has in Mesa and Gilbert

Mesa- food was good, I had the new Shrimp Sand which that they offered with french fries that were really good, the bread was also great.The only complaint I have about the Mesa location was the staff, our waitress had a verbal argument with the manager in front of all the diners.. and the manager argued right back at her. It was very bad management and didnt make us feel \"at home..\" service was lacking.

Gilbert- had the same sandwich, I asked for shredded lettuce on the sandwich and our waiter proceeded to tell me that it had shredded lettuce on the sandwich (which i knew wasn't true).. went ahead and let him have his way.. and low and behold DIDNT have shredded lettuce. He apologized but the whole situation was annoying.

Overall there food is awesome, but the staff could be a little more educated on manners and how to treat patrons."}
{"text":"I got the pizza and it was very dissapointing, soggy and tasted strangely. I will have to go back and try something else.

The service was great and prices reasonable. I like the fact that they have the outside area. In the inside it feels cozy."}
{"text":"I can't remember if it was Iain or Joel who told me to order the cheesesteak after my pizza experience... but whoever it was is my hero. I freakin love it. My friend and I went the other night and he loved it too! Flancers has made my round in places to eat that aren't freaking far away from my dang house. I tested out the curb side awhile back when it was raining and I just loved that. I gave my car hop a little bit extra for having to bring it out in the rain.  She brought it out quickly and my food was piping hot. I think I will try the french onion soup next time i go."}
{"text":"Philly Cheese Steak was disappointing. Why? It was missing the steak and there was so little cheese it was barely noticeable. The menu said \"grilled steak\" but it was really shaved roast beef, dry as a bone, that resembled the processed \"meat\" you'd find at Arby's. I ordered it with optional $1.50 bell peppers, banana peppers, and mushrooms. If I had to guess, there was 1 tablespoon of the additional toppings TOTAL on the sandwich. The extra toppings brought the cost of this Not Steak sandwich to $12.75. At least the fries were good. 

My wife had a half ham sandwich with Ceasar salad. She must have thought the sandwich was ok, she didn't give any feedback about it. She did complain to me about the salad though. Waaaay too much dressing! It was actually a ridiculous amount of dressing tossed in the salad, like someone decided pour on the whole bottle.

This is the second time we have dined here, and it will be the last. We tried it a few years ago, and we weren't impressed then. Hoping things had improved, we gave it another shot. I so wanted it to be better, as it is close to home. We won't be back. $30 for two sandwiches and two sodas is steep when the food is good, ridiculous when it is sub-par."}
{"text":"All I can say Is the food here is Good!!! The service is Good.. the people  are very nice the place is clean... The Green Chili is what makes my top list which I hope they share where it comes from..But the chief is on top of things and always comes out and greets the people he cooks for.. Now that is old school and hard to come by. Keep doing Great Customer Service only better things can come to this business.."}
{"text":"An upgraded jimmy johns, Flancer's bread tastes JUST like the sandwich fast food place, which is a good thing, as it is baked fresh every day. They are known for their sandwiches but also carry good salads, pizza and calzones.

Through not the best sandwiches I have had in AZ, for the $8-10 price range, the flavors are decent and the portions are filling. My italian sandwich was OK, nor super meaty but flavorful and fresh enough. I did the salad and sandwich combo with a side of goat cheese salad (with spinach, pine nuts, garbanzo beans and sun fried tomatoes. I highly highly encourage this option as 1) you get a pretty big meal that is mildly healthy, 2) the sides offered with a full sandwich are definitely not worth the $1 savings. The goat cheese salad was ok except for the overly chunky dressing and the super dry breaded goat cheese (which should have been creamy and sharp in flavor).

Now, the sides. My friends ordered the fruit cup and the jalapeno mashed potatoes, which both sucked. The fruit cup was a tiny bowl with 3  1x1\" pieces of cantaloupe while the mashed potatoes was a little bitter (from the jalapeno), was dry, lacked salt and came in like a fried cake with no remnant of  it ever being mashed potatoes. From what I saw being served around, the sweet potatoes are the thing to order, but since I haven't tried them myself, i'm gonna pull an NWA and say \"don't quote me boy, I ain't said shit\".

 ^ If you did not get the above reference then you are too young and I feel really sorry for you. If you did, *high five*

Overall 3 stars for the flavor of the food, though I will say that the service was really good and I would definitely return for a quick bite to eat, but not necessarily recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots in the valley. Usually go to the one on Gilbert Rd, but happen to be working in Mesa so I stopped in. 
My go to sandwich is It's About Thyme...love the chicken with balsamic and mushrooms! Another fav is the Chile Verde Birdie...with extra green chili please. They always have daily specials available and lighter food options available. 
They bake their own bread which is what takes there sandwiches to the next level! 
The pizza is equally good!  Love this place and wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"I used to go there regularly but they're serving sizes seem to have shrunk. It's a bit disappointing because their food is pretty good. I understand with the world the way it is costs keep going up and someone has to take the punishment"}
{"text":"I just like to say that Mary is always a pleasure to be in her section. She always remembers what we like 2 ice teas and the green chili mushroom phyllos. And all the staff is great always accommodating to your needs and shout out to all the cooks great job."}
{"text":"I have to give it 3  only because 3 times my husband ordered the pastrami sandwich 1st time thick and juicy but the next 2 time SKIMPY AND DRY and not that flavorful we raved to my family visiting from. Out of state my brother ordered it DRY and SKIMPY  extremely disappointed!!
I would LOVE to go back but if the CHEF's are going to be inconsistent with recipes or not care why go back!! 
I do give a 3 strikes your out! But I'm willing to give it one more shot!! 
Please don't disappoint!! 
Let me say they had a special SHRIMP SANDWICH it was bomb!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly place! We enjoyed the people and the decor. My husband enjoyed the burger. So many burgers are either pre made frozen patties or seasoned until they no longer taste like hamburger. The meat on this burger tasted fresh with just the right amount of seasoning (salt and pepper). The prickly pear chicken  was a nice twist on chicken, making the chicken delicately sweet with a mild cheese to compliment it. For sides we tried the jalapeño Mac n cheese and jalapeño mashed potatoes. Tasty options when you're not in the mood for fries. We will certainly be back to try other menu items, not only because of the food but because of the people."}
{"text":"I would love to tell you how the food was here.  I would be thrilled if I could write an 8 page diatribe that makes you drool because I describe the various tastes so well.  But I can't.

We hit this up on the recommendation of a friend on a Friday night.  Of course it's Friday in Gilbert, so we know it might be a little busy, but only one group was waiting when we got there. 

We walk in and wait, and someone comes up to us and says \"2? It will be a few, what's your name\" and then walks off after putting our name on the list.  I grab 2 menus and we start to wait.

The food must be great here, because the place was packed!  We watched, stomachs growling as plate after loaded plate was set out for delivery to the dining masses. 

After about 10 minutes, we decided to grab a seat outside, as we kept getting trampled by the staff (it's not a big place.)  We sit, and see that there are now quite a few people waiting, all but the one group having arrived well after we did.   And then the magic moment came, several groups had finished their meal and were on their way!

The group before us (about 5 or 6 people) were seated, and we continued to patiently wait.  At this point it had been 20 minutes, which in my mind exceeds the \"a few\" we were quoted upon arrival, but we were willing to be chill and wait it out.

Then....(insert dramatic mood music here) a server came out and called a name on the list.....it was not my name, and no one in the line responded to it.  She called it a few more times, and someone who just walked in 5 minutes before stood up and said did you call Becky (name changed to protect the stranger) - not even close.  The server said \"No, but come on anyhow\" and allowed this person to jump the line.  At that point we had enough hunger and thirst and went elsewhere.

I cut a LOT of slack to servers, especially when they are busy, but the attitude and the service we saw in the 20 plus minutes of simply waiting left us cold.  I'd be willing to go back and give them a try, but I might pack a snack first."}
{"text":"Great Sandwich!

I was treated to \"free lunch\" yesterday after agreeing to an impromptu Sunday afternoon business meeting, and I was happily surprised when I was told that, among my choices strewn on the table, was a Prickly Pear sub from a mystery establishment known as Flancer's.

The bread was perfect - and this is coming from someone who pretty much altogether stopped eating sandwiches 5 or so years ago due to the consistent let-down of most breads.  The crust was nice and crusty, fresh as can be, and didn't overwhelm the rest of the sandwich.

I wish I knew everything that comprised this Chicken n Prickly Pear concoction, but I don't - I was too busy.  All I know is it tasted great, and it made up for the fact that I was dedicating my Sunday afternoon to a round table discussion that did not include an outdoor activity.

Good work, Flancer's!  You made my first trip to Gilbert a great one!"}
{"text":"Great food. Best Philly cheesesteak I have ever had! The service was wonderful and everyone is super friendly. Has a great home cooked family feel."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! The sandwiches are really really good. I went today for the first time. The sandwiches are just perfect. My friend had to prickly pear chicken sandwich, it was smoky and delicious. I had the Philly cheesesteak, one of the best! The bread is really great. I loved the coleslaw, fresh and perfectly seasoned. It is small and not fancy but I love that kind of place. The service was also excellent. I can't wait to go back and try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food here is always great. Servers are friendly with many of them having worked here for many years. I have no idea why people wait in line at restaurants in downtown Gilbert when this place is a short walk up the road. Wake up people!  Flancers rocks!"}
{"text":"Our first steak sandwich from you and it was good but I'm sorry to say its only half the size of a \"philly cheesesteak\"...maybe raise the price a bit and make it bigger! I had to buy my guy a taco from lulu's after dinner to fill him up...."}
{"text":"Flancers is our GO TO lunch place.  You always know the foods going to be great, and it's in a fun part of town.  Just up the road is old town Gilbert.  If you haven't tried this place, I think you'll enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I can't help but write a review of this place. First of all I'm immediately greeted upon entering. Then when I ask for a booth for two people they didn't give me grief about it. The food is always outstanding. I had the Hoagie & Bacall Italian (heated) and it was delicious. The bread is fresh and I believe made right there. The ingredients were tasty. The service outstanding; always had a refill on my drink, gave good recommendations and was easy to talk to. I live nearby and every time I go I ask myself why I don't go more often. That's about to change!"}
{"text":"Waiting area is small so it gets a little busy, but food and service are always great. Everyone is always very friendly, and portions are a good size. There have. Been times where I've gone in during dinner time and the restaurant is fairly busy. The manager is always helping out the servers and busing tables, busy or not. Awesome food and awesome service always."}
{"text":"Ah.. I just paid $13 for an 8 in sub? Not worth it. Nothing memorable except the high prices.."}
{"text":"Oh my God this is one of the best meals I ever had. 
Seriously! I drove around tonight looking for a place to eat. I really wanted a burger, but I came in here and got a Philly CheeseSteak with green chilles and fries. 
Everything is sooooooo goood"}
{"text":"Another great lunch at Flancer's. Paul and his crew make you feel at home with their consistently delicious menu. 

Always a treat!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened?? They renovated the place, which did open the inside up a lot. But the food quality went down.  I LOVED THEIR FOOD. We've been back in a few times hoping it'd be good again, but it's not. We might try the other location in Mesa and see if it's good. I just keeping asking \"What happened to the food?\""}
{"text":"Yum! Love their chicken philly sandwich and the goat cheese appetizer. The green chile mac and cheese is the bomb!

Fun atmosphere - love the music and decor. Sometimes the service is a bit less attentive then it should be - not bad, but it could use a bit more finesse."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I have tried several different burgers and have been really impressed with all of them so far.  Their bread is homemade and it's delicious! It really adds to the overall taste of the burger. Their staff has always been friendly as well."}
{"text":"Always enjoy our meals at Flancers.

Prickly pear chicken is awesome, love the flavor.  Never had a disappointing meal at Flancers.

Staff is always pleasant and we love all the rock and roll posters!"}
{"text":"First time eating there and my boyfriend's second. It was delicious! We got a fantastic pizza that was half Goat to Get You Into My Life and half Walk on the Wild Side. Service was a bit slow (more than a 20 minute wait). Bit upset though when we got the bill and saw there was a $10 Charge for going half and half! We felt the waitress should have told us since it was such a significant upcharge. After the tip, it had nearly doubled the cost of what we'd ordered! We understand charging for a split on specialty pizzas, but there should be something on the menu (we couldnt find anything) about it or the waitress should say something. The food though, as I said before, was FANTASTIC, the music was great, and aside from the upcharge, our waitress was very nice. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for lunch.  Got there about 11:30 not very busy...FINE with me!!  The server was friendly and attentive.  The manager stopped by to ask how things were.  I had a beer and the Chile Verde Birdie (I'm sure this is wrong, but the jist of the name)  with a side of chile mac & cheese.  Very good!!  The bread was soft and the sandwich was...just....great!!  Between the beer and mac & cheese I was only able to eat half my sandwich.  My friend had some chipotle pasta.  She said it was great as well!!  Based on all the factors...ambiance, staff, food, prices and location...I will....DEFINITELY be back!!  I also want to mention..it was...PERFECT temperature!!  I had on a hoodie over a t-shirt, didn't get too hot or too cold for the time we were there!! ....Awesome!!...Thanks Flancer's!!"}
{"text":"I've been to both locations and the Food is great! Love their Philly cheesesteak, Filet Mignon/Gorgonzola, and Prickly Pear chicken sandwiches.  The Pizza is good too.  Best app is the goat cheese bruschetta w/ balsamic."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing and the staff is so friendly. I recommend the prickly pair sandwich with a side salad but both there sweet potatoe fries and the regular fries are wonderful!"}
{"text":"the atmosphere is relaxed, the wait staff is friendly, the cheesesteam is good, and the half - baked cookie with ice cream is the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"I always love eating at Flancer's the staff is always super friendly and the food is always amazing with out question. The ambience is always great as well. I've been to this location a number of times and I've never had a bad experience. The cost is definitely a little on the high end but I'm sure it's justified. 
This Flancer's will always be one of my top choices of where to eat."}
{"text":"Flancer's was recommended from my family's previous experiences,  which have been good! I arrived for lunch, busy, server short on service,  food took a very long time to arrive. I was disappointed.  Unfortunately,  I will not be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great Neighborhood, friendly staff and awesome food,  this is it.  We have had a great variety of different things from the menu and have never been disappointed. House made bread is incredible."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant 
Bread is fresh baked. Their cheesesteak is excellent. Chili verde birdie also very good. 
Goat cheese bruschetta are really good. Fresh lemonade."}
{"text":"Yes the food is good I will say that and the servers are overly perkey which could be turned down a notch this is where we had pizza after vitos disaster the pizzas they had on the menu were  fine but i did not want goat cheese and chicken or 3 kind of meats on my pizza so we got the cheese pizza with add your own ingredints the issue i had w/that was every add on was 2$  olives 2$ onion 2$ tomatoes2$  mushrooms 2$ ect ect just seamed like alot for certain ingridents."}
{"text":"Flancers is a great little \"hole in the wall\" restaurant! The perfect setting. Amazing food with a little Flancers twist on it. Staff extremely friendly and QUICK! Amazing dinner tonight. Highly recommend Flancers!"}
{"text":"Really love this place! The wait staff is always attentive and friendly, the whole place is clean and has a nice relaxed ambiance, and most importantly they have a great menu with lots of variety! Everything I've tried here I have enjoyed: from a solid lunch and dinner menu, to a few delicious desserts, to a great beer selection. The We Must Meat sandwich, Guac and Roll burger, and Roadhouse pizza are my personal favorites-- but you really can't go wrong with any of it!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding BUT The menu is new, prices are high,
for a mediocre, turkey lunchmeat sandwich with a salad and a green chili burger with a green salad.  We added sweet potato fries and ice teas, almost $40 bucks.... It's a frigging sandwich shop.  What gives here?

For quite sometime, I have not been willing to go through the obstacle course of \"cones\" on Gilbert Rd.  But I braved it tonight because I missed \"Spinach Wheel Got To Go Round\" salad!!!  The salad has been changed and it was missing the spicy chili pecans and the hot bacon dressing, SO a half salad and half sandwich is $12.50, are you serious???

I will not be returning.  it's just not special anymore, baguettes are blah, the salad missing ingredients, lunchmeat and a tiny burger?  The fries were good but extra.   

An exorbitant bill...and extreme disappointment!  You lost a faithful customer"}
{"text":"Side salad is great. Love the addition of the garbonzo beans. They also have a terrific balsamic dressing. Their cobbler is pretty good, love the crunchy topping, however, was not a fan of the filling that day. I think it an apple rhubarb. Not much of a fan of rhubarb. Make sure you ask what flavor the cobbler is if you are planning on ordering it."}
{"text":"I dined here on a Friday, seeking something different from fast food. I only had 30 minutes to eat and after announcing my time crunch to the manager, I was seated right away. My sandwich (an awesome BLT) arrived quickly and I was able to finish well within the 30 minute deadline. Thank you, Flancers for the quick service AND the best BLT I've had, hands down."}
{"text":"I love this place.. Food is so good, staff is pleasant all is good here. I love their it's About Thyme, goat cheese bruschetta, and my own spin on a pizza.. SOOO GOOD!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I bought  a Groupon here a few months ago and finally made the trip here to use it. I have been reading about this place for a while so I was excited to finally try it.

The BF ordered a Philly Cheesesteak and I had the half sandwich (Prickly Pear Chicken) and salad (Spinach Pear) combo. We also ordered some green chile cheese fries to share. 

The Green Chile fries were good. It had ample cheese, bacon and green chile ratio to the amount of fries. My Prickly Pear Chicken sandwich was good but I liked the Philly Cheesesteak better. My BF, on the other hand, liked the chicken sandwich better so he offered to switch out the rest of my sandwich. The bread was tasty and you can tell it was freshly baked.

The spinach salad was okay. I was expecting a cold refreshing spinach salad and was kind of surprised that the pears, bacon and dressing was warm on top of the bed of spinach. The warm topping wilted the spinach a bit and it was almost like I was eating sauteed spinach instead of a salad. I will stick to the sandwiches next time. 

The resturant is kind of small. It reminds me more of a place where you order at the counter and go find yourself a seat while waiting for your food but its not. They do offer table service. It was also kind of warm inside because of the close proximity of the kicthen  to the dining area since the space is so small but it wasn't anything too unbearable."}
{"text":"We love Flancers!!!  I love their filet salad with gorgonzola dressing (yum!) and husband loves their Philly Cheesesteak with fries.  He says it's the best he's had.  Pizza is o.k. but greasy.  Service has always been great."}
{"text":"Always great food and great service. The Prickly Pear sandwich is a classic. I recommend the chicken wings and pizza. The restaurant has a cozy feel and it's great to patronize a locally owned establishment."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place so maybe my expectations were just a little too high. Got the burger with bacon, egg, and cheese also added avocado. The meat was dry and overcooked. Nothing special at all, kind of bland. No signature flavor. I feel that I get more flavor out of a McDonald's cheeseburger. It sucks because I was really craving a good burger and I don't even think I'm going to be able to finish this due to the dryness and lack of taste. Not too fond of the bun either. The sweet potato fries were okay. Again, nothing special. Definitely not worth the $16 I paid. Having buyers remorse just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Had the guac burger, which, while not really a guac burger due to three small slices of avocado instead of guacamole, was cooked as ordered (true medium rare) and good. Really liked the roll they used for the bun. Wasn't a huge fan of the bruschetta, but that's because I'm used to a different recipe- boyfriend really liked it. Green chile mac & cheese was a little oily, like it had been cooked hours before and the cheese had separated, but still tasted okay. Spiked prickly pear lemonade was probably the cheapest drink I've had since I got to the Phx metro area a few days ago. Overall, it was a better-than-decent meal at a reasonable price, and the service was excellent. The fourth star is for the friendly, efficient service."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch here today!  The server was upbeat and friendly. The food was served quickly and tasted delicious. We were so happy with the service that we took the server up on his suggestion to try the warm cookie and ice cream desert. Yum!  We are definitely coming back for seconds!"}
{"text":"Literally the best sandwich's ever. Plus they offer gluten free bread, that is very good. Not like many gluten free breads I have tried. If you don't have a gluten allergy, their bread (baked in house) is beyond great. 

Their specalty salads are unique and combine flavors that compliment each other."}
{"text":"Have visited Flancers 4-5 times in the past month. They have great sandwiches with really wonderful home made bread. Side dishes also spot on. If you enjoy hatch green chilis you will love this place.  Also have great music playing and cool art work. Try it I think you will enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is so great! We've been here several times and it never disappoints. I get the breakfast hash most days and that is absolutely amazing.

The coffee is quality! Free refills too. 

Today, I had the Cubano which has Sriracha mayo and  the jalapeño potato pie is great too."}
{"text":"All of their bread is freshly baked and you even get a free loaf if you check in on Four Square! I love the variety of food and I'm a sucker for their spicy potato mash. I've never been for happy hour but they seem to have great beers on tap from the posters all around."}
{"text":"We've been to Flancer's many times, I really like the food. I noticed the menu has been significantly cut down but my favorite It's About Thyme Chicken sandwich was still there the love their sweet potato fries.

We ordered 2 adult dishes and 3 kids meals, plus kids meals come with an ice cream treat, which the kids love.

Kid's pizza was great. Plain cheese, toppings are extra, no biggie.
Kid's mac and cheese, my 2 year old LOVED it, she ate the whole thing! Also loved the fresh fruits.
Kid's burger. Perfect size for my son, he doesn't have a huge appetite at 10 yrs old. Cheese was an extra 50 cents, no biggie, but to add bacon...$3!!! The kid's meal cost $6, the burger isn't even a full size burger. We asked the waitress about it and she said it was right....really too pricey. Even at Zinburger, where they give you a full size buger, they only charged $1 for bacon. Oh well, live and learn.

Eveything else was great though, loved the fresh lemonade, pastrami sandwich was great! Not soggy or greasy."}
{"text":"Most unique menu I have seen.

Everything on the menu is wonderful.  The building does not do Flancer's service.  It is in a hidden strip mall and looks like it might be a flop.  Anyone willing to go in and wait to be seated (there usually is a line) will be in for a pleasant surprise.

I could eat here every day.  The service is also unsurpassed."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the goat cheese bruchetta (small size,) a burger, a philly steak and 2 soft drinks. The bill was $37 plus tax. Woah! 
The other night we went to a bar, ordered 2 burgers, a soft drink, 2 bottles of beer and a large pitcher of beer for a little cheaper. 
The food was good but nothing memorable. The service and atmosphere was the best part but I will not be back until the prices are lower."}
{"text":"The bread alone is reason to come here over and over- homemade and fresh.

But the flavors of everything are so unique and delicious, it sets Flancer's apart from any other Restuarant.

Service is attentive and quick - prices are perfect

Get Here!"}
{"text":"Holy green chili baked cheesy mashed potatoes sprinkled with angel tears.  

After eating at flancers multiple times I've come to the conclusion that being able to create amazing food is a natural born talent and not something that you can just practice a lot. 

I'm pretty sure they must have some type of X man super hero mash up that's like 59%  Chuck Noris and 41% Boudain Keller. 

In short - the tri tip sandwich is mouth watering and do the green chili mash potatoes"}
{"text":"OMG.  I wish I could eat here every single day.

I've only been twice (sadly) but will be going here often now that I've discovered them.

Absolutely DELICIOUS.  YUMMY.  TASTY.  AWESOME.

First time we went a little nuts and ordered a couple appetizers as well as sandwhiches.  Had the Goat Cheese Bruschetta as well as the Green Chili Mushroom Phyllos.  Both delish, but very different.  The bruschetta is for balsamic vinegar lovers.  The phyllos are for mushroom/cream cheese lovers.

For sandwiches we had the It's About Thyme Chicken and Still Crazy After All These Years Veggie (we split them, of course, I'm not that much of a pig!).  They were both HEAVENLY.  Can I use that word to describe sandwiches??  Well I am.  The chicken is full of mushroomy-cheesy goodness, and the veggie was so unique with the beer battered mozzarella!

The 2nd time we went, I ordered the Chile Verde Birdie Turkey and was mildly disappointed, I think because I was expecting it to be a hot sandwich and got a cold one instead (my bad for not reading the menu carefully enough).  If I had read the menu more carefully and knew what to expect I would have been much more pleased with it.  My fault, not theirs.

Oh, both times had the prickly pear lemonade (spiked of course) - very tasty.

The only knock I will give this place is the guy who might run the place (not sure, either that or he wishes he did).  Both times we've come we wanted to sit on the patio outside and he gave us trouble each time about it.  Really?  Then why have a patio??

But I am still giving this place 5 stars because I so LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their food.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"After hearing such good things about Flancer's we thought we would give it a try.  Boy, were we NOT impressed.  There were four of us in our party, and each ordered something different  After waiting what seemed like an eternity, the food finally came.  I got 1/2 Verde Birdie turkey sandwich. and fruit. The turkey was so dry, I could barely swallow it. My fruit cup was merely cantaloupe that was good, but had a lot of the green rind left on it and one little piece of honey dew.   I paid a lot extra to get one small piece of bacon and a tiny slice of avocado added to my sandwich.  I will have to admit the bread was amazing.  It was so moist and fresh.  THAT was the ONLY good thing about my meal! My eating companions also had sandwiches and COLD french fries. We all felt the prices were way to high for what we got, and having to wait that long to be served..  Maybe if our waitress would have come by to check on us, we would have been able to share our concerns with her.  Not once did she stop by our table and ask how our meal was.  I never received a refill on my drink or even asked if I wanted one--not until almost 30 minutes after we were finished eating and getting ready to leave.  Not one of us were impressed by the food OR by the service. Its a shame because we had such high hopes.  We wont be returning."}
{"text":"Always great service and food! Their baguette rolls and green chile mayo are awesome. We really love the Italian sandwich, cheese steak, mashed potato pie, and the peanut butter pie. We haven't had a bad thing here yet."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always fantastic! Greg is always so nice and helpful. I have never had anything short of delicious at this restaurant. The service is always quick and friendly and they are very attentive. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Every aspect of the meal was great.  Starting with the service: fast, friendly, knowledgeable, and not overbearing.  Food also was great, i had the meatloaf.  Normally I'm wearry of ordering meat loaf out, but at the recommendation of the server I tried it. Glad I did. Price was good, too. Background music, good.  Bathrooms, clean.  Good hustle guys!"}
{"text":"This place has REALLY, REALLY tasty food.

The kids and I dropped in for an early dinner, and we liked everything we tried.

The Prickly Pear Chicken Sandwich is what I had.  Prickly pear marinated chicken breast with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise & melted provolone, and I substituted for the green chile mayonnaise for 25 cents.  It was seasoned chicken on a freshly baked baguette and was VERY tasty.  The chicken was made super-tender by the marination and had a fabulous taste to it.

My daughter had the kid's menu cheeseburger and fries and she really liked it.

The boy had 6 medium buffalo wings and the chicken strip appetizer.  He compared the strips to the ones they serve at Rock-n-Roll Chicken Fingers, which is HIGH PRAISE indeed, because those are the best we have ever had.

For dessert we shared the \"Fresh Half Baked Cookie with Ice Cream $5.00\" and it reminded us of the cookie dessert at Oregano's which is basically the same thing.  We sere split on it - my daughter liked this one better, but the boy and I like Oregano's version a little better.  Either way, it was YUMMY !!

The waitress was efficient but a little \"distant\" like she was just going through the motions.  She seemed to be in a bad mood maybe - so I'm not going to ding the restaurant for that - but I hope I get someone in a better mood next time we eat there.

And there WILL be a next time.  Great little place to eat."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites. We go there almost every Saturday night. We always get great service and Ben is the best!

Favorite items: Filet Mignon (sandwich or salad), prickly pear chicken sandwich, Cuban sandwich and the prickly pear spiked lemonade. Their fries are delish! Thin with the perfect amount of crisp!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. But the service was horrible! Ask for a refill and a side of ranch when our food come out, didn't see the waitress again until we were just about done with our food. And all she said was oh I forgot do you still want it? Like really? We were done eating! Don't think we will be going back"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and pasta. Usually a bit of a wait, but well worth it. The prices are reasonable, but a downright steal when you can grab one of the many coupons they have floating around. Big fan of the prickly pear chicken sandwich -- hard to remember the name because each menu item has a special creative name.  Service is reliable and I've never waited for a refill."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was not as I expected, and felt very crowded due to the small area."}
{"text":"First timer and I must say, the portion is perfect! Yes it's a tad bit pricey, but worth it. Their bread is amazing. Like a soft ciabatta roll. Cool atmosphere and everyone was pleasant. Check em out!"}
{"text":"Yes it sort of feels like a poor man's frat house with a menu that appeals to the same crowd but that's alright because these sandwiches are top notch.  Probably the best cheesesteak in the Valley and what puts it over the top is the fresh toasted roll that holds it all together.  Factor in the very personable service and you have one more place in the East Valley worth visiting."}
{"text":"This place is a great eatery. Have been here twice in the past month. Both times I chose to have a combo, visit #1 I had a half BLT & soup and visit #2 had a salad and soup. Each time the meal was perfectly prepared, flavorful and with fresh ingredients. Soon they will be introducing breakfast, can't wait. Happy Hour goes from 3-6 pm with both dining and drinking reduced prices. You can't miss if you come here. One of my next visits I'll have to have one of their desserts."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood spot - one of my favorite local AZ restaurants. Staff is SUPER friendly and helpful - we almost look forward to seeing them as much as we do the food!

The cheesesteak with green chilly mayo is my favorite. Be sure to add the green chili mayo to anything your order! Their bread is fresh, and some of the best sandwich bread I've ever had - and you can order bread loaves to go. Great fries and you really can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches, and they usually have some unique desserts that are quite good. They also do pizza - I've never had it, but my family has and they all had good things to say. 

A must-do if you're in Gilbert or close by!!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday night my husband went to Flancer's Cafe for dinner.  Neither one of us were very hungry but still wanted to eat.

We ended up ordering a \"special\" pizza that really rivaled the pizzas we had experienced in Italy.  All the ingredients were so fresh. I didn't know pizza could taste so good.

Don't let the \"diner\" deco turn you off, the food is fantastic and fresh!.

Gail M."}
{"text":"Awesome As always! Get the Goat Cheese Bruschetta. Da Bomb!"}
{"text":"Pure awesomeness! It is very rare that my whole family is happy with our dining experience. I'm gluten free, my husband is picky and I have two little girls under the age of six. Well Flancer's has something for all of us. Delicious gluten free bread to complete a sandwich for me. My husband couldn't get enough of his meal. And my two girls loved their meals too. And they got ice cream afterwards! The staff was great especially Eric the manager. He was so personable. He was super helpful too. This is an A++++++ in my families book. We will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Flancer's is a local restaurant where excellent regional flavors meet a home-grown twist. Prickly Pear chicken sandwich, It's About Thyme chicken sandwich and It's Bitchin' pizza are my favorites, and they also are some of the awarded selections on the menu.

Every single dish on the menu is done well, and executed consistently. This place has only gotten better each year, and I can highly recommend them without any reservation.

One of the absolute best local, home style eateries. The prices are lower and the atmosphere is very chill. It has a diner feel with food that is 20x above any diner. Want something different than southwest or Mexican cuisine- try Flancer's. You'll be thanking me."}
{"text":"I ate here again and the food seemed much better. Still poor parking situation,  but the garlic bread was very good and they have a diet menus with smaller portions and calorie counts."}
{"text":"Visited on Friday.  Ordered the Match with Hatch burger with jalapeno & cheddar potato pie on the side.  Presentation was good.  The burger was disappointing to be honest -- green chile was minimal (and not flavorful) and served luke warm.  The picture on the website and menu looks oh so much better.  The potato pie was good and had a bit of pizzazz to it that the burger lacked and was served hot.  Customer service was good and lots of \"regular customers\" were about ordering.  I won't be back but given the regular clientele within, it probably satisfies many peoples tastes."}
{"text":"I really like Flancer's Cafe.  My favorite item on the menu is the Prickly Pear chicken sandwich.   The service here is quick and the staff is friendly.  They serve Odell beer, too, so that's a big plus.  I like a lot of the restaurants in the downtown Gilbert area and Flancer's is definitely one to check out if you are in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! This place has delicious food- I've never been disappointed with a meal. My personal favorite is the prickly pear chicken sandwich with green chile mac-n-cheese. A great place to grab a bite, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 5 years or so. My former boss introduced me to this place and have been going back ever since that time. I used to work in sales and would purchase sandwich trays to bring to presentations on a regular basis. It was a great way to butter up the crowd! Now that I am not working in sales, I just go to enjoy the food that I love. Great wings, amazing sandwiches and delicious pizza. Nice variety of the menu with quality ingredients. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Simple little Gilbert,AZ joint but it delivers some solid food options.  

I dig their Prickly Pear chicken sandwich.  Has a nice, sweet taste to whatever it is that they marinate it in (that turns the chicken purple).  Spread some of their green chile mayo over the soft, tasty baguettes they use and, boom!

The green chile mac n' cheese ain't bad either."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Flancers!  This is the kind of food you get a craving for!  the homemade bread melts in your mouth!  Our favorites are the Prickly Pear Chicken Sandwich, It's About Thyme Chicken, and the Philly Cheesesteak.....but you also can't miss the goat cheese bruchetta!"}
{"text":"Honestly I wanted to love this place but I just couldn't...my boyfriend and I went here a week ago for a late lunch/early dinner, the service was fantastic. The guy with the glasses that served us was super attentive and sweet, made sure we were takin care of. I ordered a BLT sandwich and some fries and my boyfriend ordered a burger and a salad. He said he really liked his meal even though his burger looked a little strange to him. His salad was delicious, I ate more of it than he did. My BLT was kind of gross, chewy, nasty bacon and the bread hurt my mouth. The fries were good, ate them all. Maybe I just need to try something different next time I go here. A lot of people seem to love this place and I want to make sure I try it again. Oh and the beer on tap was kind of expensive."}
{"text":"I looove this place! The staff is incredible and the food is amazing :) my favorite is the prickley pear sandwich with sweet potato fries! The bread is so good and the sweet glaze of prickley pear over there tender chicken smothered with cheese and there green chili mayo, meltes in your mouth! I also like there penny's tin roof brownie, it also supports a good cause and it's so yummy! The price is reasonable and the food is even better. The great thing about Flancers is that there quality never changes, every time I visit there it was just as good as the last time. Thx u flancers."}
{"text":"This place is great. Been there twice now and the food is top notch. I guess that would make since because some big name designed it and the menu. Real food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a excellent club sandwich and a unique side of jalapeño and cheddar mash potato."}
{"text":"This place has a good small town feel to it as it reminds me of places in the Midwest.  I've been here about 4-5 times and the food has always been incredible.  The sandwich that stands out to me was the \"No Bones About It Chicken\" sandwich, which was a breaded chicken sandwich with hot wing sauce.  You could tell the bread was homemade and fresh as it was soft.  This sandwich is incredible and very flavorful!  Definitely a favorite if you enjoy chicken wings as I do.  The \"Goat Cheese Bruschetta\" is delicious as well.  I've seen the pizzas and have heard a lot of good things about them, but have yet to try one.  

The staff here are all very friendly and nice.  This is definitely one of my favorite places to grab a sandwich in the Gilbert area.  It is a little small but I've never really had to wait."}
{"text":"At first impression walking in your greeted by everyone that can catch eye contact with you. Promptly shown to a seat and your drink order is taken.  

The best drink to get is the Fresh Lemonade it's outstanding on a hot Arizona day.  

For food the Philly Cheesesteak is incredible,  the consistency of the bread is reminiscent of an artisan bread from the East Coast. The steak quality used was razor thin and tasty,  I paired mine with green chilies for a switch and wow they were just the right amount of spicy and flavor. 

A close second is the Prickly Pear Grilled Chicken sandwich,  juicy,  flavor,  and sweetness,  not sopping with Glaze but actually cooked into the tender chicken beast of which there is no shortage of on the sandwich,  using the same bread it's a great combo.  

I will definitely return and hopefully try one of the many desserts they offer."}
{"text":"Has always been my favorite sandwich place. The bread is baked on site and it is DELICIOUS! Their menu is diverse but I always seem to order the cheesesteak because it is the best I have had outside of Philly. !! Along the walls are old record albums that was fun to see and I would hear from other tables \" I had that album\". The sweet potato fries are the best in the valley. Seasoned perfect!"}
{"text":"I love Flancer's. Staff is friendly, really good food at fair prices. My favorite is the Chilli Verdi Birdie add bacon and avocado. Lots of great salads with quality leafy greens.  Pizza is good too.  Food is always very fresh and flavorful.  Can't go wrong here.  My preferred restaurant in NE Mesa."}
{"text":"I have always heard good things about this place!  I have directed other people here, though I have only driven by it for past 9 years.  Well I found myself in their parking lot today so I wandered in for a bite.
I got the salmon salad and it was very very good!

Many other.items on the menu that I want to try  so, I will be stopping by more often!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good small independent places in the east valley. Flancers has a great food and friendly staff. The bread is always fresh and soft. Great cheesesteaks, we must meat sandwich and baked chipotle fettucine. Sure you may pay a couple bucks extra but well worth it."}
{"text":"Flancers is a great change of pace from the normal restaurant scene. I don't know that I would call it divey exactly, but it's very comfortable and laid back. You could have a chill, two hour lunch with friends here and not feel pressured to get up and leave. I like that! 

The food is usually very good, but a little inconsistent with some items. For instance, I really enjoyed the well seasoned steak and fresh veggies in the tenderloin salad I had at my last visit, but I would've liked more flavor variety in the iceberg-heavy lettuce mix. On the plus side, the kids pizza has always been top notch - good sauce, chewy dough, perfectly done. I'd love to try one of the more creative pies - one day I'll have to come without the kid!

I've never had a complaint about the drinks at Flancers, especially the prickly pear lemonade - oh so perfect for the AZ heat! I've always found a decent selection of beers on tap, too, including local brews. Overall, it's an unpretentious, happy place to relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"I have heard about Flancer's for years... and yet I had never been there until yesterday for lunch.

Had the Philly Cheesesteak because our waitress said that it was the most popular item - and I can see why.

It was big and it was great.

Service was friendly, it didn't take long to get our food once we ordered it and the Cheesesteak was fantastic.

Yep, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a friend and enjoyed our food. For me, the only real issue are the prices. As I have now read in other reviews, others have expressed similar thoughts. I ordered the corned beef rueben and my friend had the meatloaf. The corned beef was very tasty and is definitely a five star sandwich. The meatloaf for my taste was average. For dessert, the bread pudding was tried and I was not a fan. It seemed dry and the baby scoop of vanilla ice cream to top it off was comical. 85373380, food was good but prices are high for the food and portions. $3 for a fountain drink in my opinion is ridiculous and would like to think the ice cream portion for my bread pudding is not the norm."}
{"text":"I got the prickly pear sandwich ad it was very yummy.  There food never seems to get old.  I have tried something different every time we've come and have been happy with everything on the menu.  There desserts are to die for!!"}
{"text":"It took the four of us a long time to make up our minds because the titles of the sandwiches were so fun we had to read the entire menu!   But when the server told us Flancers makes its own bread, it was sandwiches all around.  

I had the prickly pear marinated chicken breast sandwich with green chili mayo and a side of sweet potato fries.  But I wish I had tried the green chili mac&cheese.  My friends tried the Chili Verde Birdie Turkey and Flancer's flagship sandwich, the Philly cheesesteak.  One was served with Asian coleslaw and the other with a small tenderloin salad.  All were very good.  

When it came to dessert, we all agreed wouldn't order our two choices again. The bread pudding serving was pretty big, but the rubbery consistency is what we didn't like.  We also tried the peach cobbler. I like cobbler with an oozy fruit filling.  This  was more of a sweet crust with a thin layer of peaches in between.  

Flancer's is a medium-sized  café, and it was full throughout lunchtime. The restaurant offers pasta, pizza, sandwiches, and salads.  It's located on the edge of the Gilbert historical district, which has many good eating establishments."}
{"text":"Great food of all varieties! I really like their pastas and sandwiches. And whenever we come, we always order a prickly pear lemonade. It's the best! Plenty of other food options to get prickly pear as well, all of which are very tasty. But really, everything is really great here. Servers are all really nice and welcoming, and the atmosphere is lively in the sense that you can tell everyone is really enjoying their meal. The only thing is that service can be a little slow when it gets packed. Sometimes I have arrived just to pick up food to go, and there was no host up front for a good 10 minutes. Thus, I'd recommend coming when it's not the lunch or dinner rush."}
{"text":"Okay so it's in a weird location and the name leaves you asking what kind of food is here? 
Well fuck , everything is Delish, a great variety, great service, desserts are outrageously good. 
They care that food tastes good. They make sure you are satisfied. They don't have same boring menu that most chains do. And they try to source some local stuff! 
One of greatest casual restaurant in valley.. !!! Oh if you love beer it seems they have great selection..."}
{"text":"So it was so good I returned the next day and tried a pastrami reuben. Another awesome choice!"}
{"text":"Sooo we just left here for our first and only visit. While sitting in a booth eating  a large cockroach crawled up the wall forcing us all up frantically. There wasn't just one. They moved us but for me that was it. They said they just sprayed and that was why.  They were apologetic. Still that needs to be resolved. They gave us a coupon for a free side salad as if we were coming back. No thank you."}
{"text":"On one of my trips to Arizona, I stopped in right when they opened on a Saturday late morning. We started with the Flancer's Green Chile Mushroom Phyllos. It has a little bit of a kick, but delicious. 
For lunch I had the half sandwich and salad ... Chile Verde Birdie Turkey with bacon and avocado and green salad. Their bread is baked fresh and ooohhh sooo soft and yummy. The sandwich was very good with the mexican chile mayonnaise. I'd like to think that anything with the mexican chile mayonnaise is yummy.
I would definitely visit this place again for a quick eat with friends and family. Service was good and the ambiance was comfortable. Prices were reasonable also. 

See you soon Flancer's!!"}
{"text":"The trick to eating at Flancer's is to find something to order that will not burn my taste buds off.  I'm not a fan of spicy food.  Seems that is their focus though.  So, this place is not for me."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night and got right in - cool environment and great team at this location. The food is amazing and Keeps me coming back. The prickly pear sandwich and the philly cheese steak are my favorite!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem among all the new restaurants in downtown Gilbert. From the great service staff, the fresh baked bread to the homemade desserts. Head a block north of the trendy places and enjoy a great meal in a comfortable setting."}
{"text":"Our worst meal experience ever.  The waitress couldn't get our order right to save her life, our drink order!  We ordered two lemonades, she drops off two ice waters, so we assume the lemonade is coming.  She comes back by a few times so we finally ask if they're coming, oh you wanted Lemonade?  How many?  I say two and hold up two fingers.  She comes back with one.  Okay fine, we'll share.  The appetizer wasn't very good or hot.  Then our food came, the buffalo chicken sandwich tasted good.  Then I take a bite of my mashed potatoes and they were ice cold in the center, like they had thawed out a frozen mound of potatoes.  We had to get up and leave, enough was enough!"}
{"text":"My mom, dad and I went to this place on a recommendation from Yelp and it was fantastic! Looking forward to going again when in AZ."}
{"text":"I believe the first time I visited Flancer's in Mesa I gave this place 5 stars. Today it got 3 not because of the food but because of the service. It took longer to get dessert than our burgers and then we only got one dessert and not too. Manager should have apologized with one dessert at no charge."}
{"text":"The fries are great.  I could be happy with those alone. The casual rock and roll vibe is also nice. The sandwiches were only receiving so-so reviews from the family, but my family and I are a bunch of skinny eating machines, so if someone skimps on the meat on a sandwich - well, this family notices.  Otherwise, the sandwiches tasted good.  Maybe offer an option for double meat?  The staff is friendly and I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table."}
{"text":"This unpretentious little place gets MAJOR points for honest to goodness deliciousness!
The Green Chili Mushroom Phylos are very yummy, but I don't usually order them because I want to leave room for my SANDWICH!
It is always difficult to choose. For me it is usually a long slow decision. Caught between Philly Cheesesteak and Green Chili Turkey. You can get bacon on that.
If having some of the most ample and delicious sandwiches on freshly in-house-made sandwich rolls weren't enough, Flancers serves up crazy-good battered fries (these make me suspect that I might have a heart attack, but hey, life is short, these are REALLY GOOD FRIES)
If two women were eating here, one sandwich plate would probably feed both amply. I usually don't get fries because they detract from the main event.
I am told that the proprietor of this fine establishment went to the Culinary Instititute of America.
There is no lame shi shi decorum here. Very straight forward good food."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have some veggie choices, delicious bread and nice staff. I loved it. I wanna become a regular. Oh yeah, they have cool concert posters too."}
{"text":"i'm trying to be very fair here with 3 stars. The food overall is good, good presentation, decent service, but this is where i have a problem. My husband and i went here a few days ago to have one of their Philly subs which are among the best i've had. The server was sweating profusely on his forehead and his head. He either had a fever or something else was going on. IDK, but sweating and then WIPING YOUR HAND FROM YOUR EYEBROWS STRAIGHT BACK TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD WAS DISGUSTING! He did this 3 x. This is unsanitary, and he needs to go home and sweat it out."}
{"text":"I had The Philly cheesesteak. The bun was fresh the meat was tender and tasty and the and it came fresh off the grill.  The french fries were crisp and hot and so fresh I had to wait till they cool down to taste.   All the sandwiches that I have hade here are very good.  The ambience of the restaurant is very nice and the service is always quick."}
{"text":"I ordered the deluxe sandwich tray with the salad on the side as catering order. Everything was made and was very fresh and tasty and arrived on time.  The prickly Pear chicken sandwich was a real hit with everybody.  I have had the pizzas from this location on a different location and they were very good too.  It was nice that the sandwiches were cut into fours so everyone could try a little bit of whatever sandwich they wanted."}
{"text":"I went to Flancer's on a friends recommendation as I was in a soup and sandwich mood.  I ordered the BLT and a cup of French Onion soup. The sandwich was a standard BLT for the most part, good bread, quality bacon and fixin's. No complaints.

The French Onion soup was a different story, very very salty. When I told the waitress she asked me if I knew French Onion was a sort of salty soup. It went back.

When I was about to leave the owner or manager asked how it was, I explained the soup and he said yes, evidently it had been sitting back there all day and had reduced down which brings out the saltiness in the soup.  Not really what I wanted to hear but decided to come back again for lunch and try it again.  Result? Salty,salty,salty. I kept quiet, paid my bill and left.

The lemonade they claim is homemade isn't bad, but I would have to see the process to make me believe it's not a powdered mix. 

Overall: C+"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything it good. I would suggest the goat to have it salad. I have come here millions of times and never had a bad experience. Even though this place is tiny get your taste buds ready for a ride to goodness. I would suggest this place."}
{"text":"Very very good food but a little pricey. Go with the prickly pear sandwhich it's money, and gotta do the goat cheese bruschetta"}
{"text":"Those who have never heard or been to Flancer's are missing out for sure.  I came across it by accident and it has been one of my favorite places to eat for more than probably 5+ years.

The french fries alone get them 5 stars (as many agree).  I get ranch with them....mmmm.  If you go there and don't get them, or at least try 1 fry you are depriving yourself of pure ecstasy.  Honest.

I always get their philly cheesesteak sandwich.  I could eat one everyday of my life probably.  Their fresh bread is amazing, crusty goodness.  I haven't tried any of the other sandwiches (I don't venture out much with my menu selections) but friends and family I've gone with never complain about their choices.  Their hot-wings are pretty dang good too.

The staff has always been super friendly and they are willing to do any special requests...food wise.  On the weekends, for lunch its usually pretty packed.  The lobby or waiting area isn't very big so if you do have to wait for a table its a little hectic up front, not complaining because its worth waiting for!  They have nice outdoor seating and have even allowed us to bring our dogs on the patio to eat.  

Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I could not believe how great all of the food was!  Try the fondue fo sho!  The green chili actually had some awesome heat.  This place is a must try.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"No good. Not fresh. Bland food with bad after taste. Service ok. Food felt warmed up from lunch. No reason to return."}
{"text":"Decent food- the goat cheese bruschetta is highly recommended.  Prices though are a little high given the simplicity of food.  You'll find better subs/pizza/salads elsewhere for slightly lower prices."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about Flancer's from the \"Mouth by Southwest\" blog and was interested to try it.  I had heard of multiple tap takeovers and other events so I was excited to see what beers they had on tap.  All that stuff must have been at the other Flancer's location, because this location didn't look like it even had taps or a bar.  My husband ordered an imperial IPA from New Belgium that he thought was pretty good (in a bottle) and I ordered the prickly pear spiked lemonade.  There was not much prickly pear flavor, but you could tell the lemonade itself was fresh squeezed.  

The sandwiches were the real highlight of our visit.  I got a sandwich with pork, arugula, tomato relish and onions.  It was amazing!  The bread was incredibly soft, but it still had a chewy outer coating so the sandwich didn't fall apart.  My husband got the Philly and he really liked it.  He is very hard to please when it comes to Philly sandwiches.  He was a huge fan of the bread.  I really liked the green chili mac and cheese too.  The jalapeño mashed potatoes were insanely hot, but if you're into that, they are right up your alley.  I would love to try more of Flancer's sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I don't usually go out for sandwiches, as in most cases I come home underwhelmed....muttering that I could have made a better sandwich myself. Flancer's was recommended to me one day by a co-worker who's taste buds I respect. I forgot about until I saw a Groupon for them. So I said \"What the heck\". Am I ever glad that I did!

The space is very casual, yet not a dump. The wait staff were very friendly, attentive and courteous. But it is the food my friends that will hook you. 

We started with the Green Chile Mushroom Phyllos. Absolutely delicious. You have to try them. My wife and I split the Prickly Pear Chicken sandwich and the \"We Must Meat, And I Ain't Lion\" filet sandwich. For sides we got the Jalapeño & Cheddar Mashed Potato Pie & Green Chile Mac & Cheese as the sides. I gotta say....they were fantastic! The flavors for both sandwiches are well thought out, but the bread they bake on site put them over the top. It is the perfect combination of softness and chew. I am still thinking about it. The mash potato pie and mac and cheese are also must haves. We are looking forward to more visits and making our way through the menu!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken sandwich.  The meat was perfection as well as the bread.  The sandwich did lack a bit of flavor (it needed some type of sauce (I did ask for no mayo).  The reason for only 4 stars is the lack of flavor and the tomatoes were not fresh.  This has got to be one of the best sandwich places in AZ."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!! I really like this place. They push the boundaries of food. Always something new to try & it always has a culinary feel to it. Great food, great location, friendly staff, & for the amazing quality you get the pricing is great! Peeps keep an eye out for their groupon deals!!! I'm hooked on their chipotle corkscrew pasta"}
{"text":"My favorite salad in Gilbert.  Prickly Pear Chicken Caesar salad is simply amazing.  Their owner and management know how to spoil you.  Best of the best."}
{"text":"Delightful Surprise!  Incredible meal and variety, I got my salad, he got his sandwich all amidst an interesting environment.  I realized after dining there that the owner is a philanthropist who gives to local charities like Sunshine Acres.  Gotta love that!  Good food and good works."}
{"text":"I am very picky with my sandwich places.  Any restaurant can slap some meat on some store bought bread and claim to make the \"World's best club sandwich\"  It doesn't mean that they actually do.  Flancer's really does make some of the best sandwiches I have ever tried and I am well traveled.  Their food is far from boring or flavorless.  I have literally almost been brought to tears at other restaurants by the lack of flavor in my entree or sandwich.  I abhor boring food and am borderline obsessed with flavor and freshness.  You are too or you wouldn't be reading reviews on yelp!!  Ask for a recommendation from your waiter and you will not be disappointed!
I L-O-V-E Flancers"}
{"text":"One of the things that I don't understand about people is why they wait in line at all of those chain restaurants for crappy food, when they can go to a locally owned restaurant such as Flancer's and get awesome food, excellent prices, and hardly a wait at all!

Flancer's makes pizza, pasta, and sandwiches very well!  Unfortunately we live about 20 miles away so we can't get there often, but when we do, we always order the same thing!  Oh, don't you hate people like that?  It's just that the dish is so good, I just crave it!  

My husband always orders a hamburger.  This is not your ordinary hamburger, this is the best that money can buy.  Fresh quality beef, cooked medium well, on a homemade, soft and chewy roll.  

The roll is more like a sub roll than a hamburger roll and they make their hamburgers oblong.  To add to that you've got to get the fresh french fries.  Nothing frozen here.  The hamburger is so flavorful it melts in your mouth.

But I think my meal is best.  I order the half sandwich and salad.  I am in love with Flancer's \"We Must Meat, I Ain't Lion\" sandwich.  It's grilled Filet Mignon, medium rare, topped with Gorgonzola cheese, chipotle mayonnaise & caramelized onions.  Mmmm.  Add to that a small Greek salad with Balsamic vinaigrette and it's a perfect meal.  Wait,. it's even more perfect if you add Flancer's famous creme brulee for desert!

Flancer's is a fantastic place.  The servers treat us like family, the atmosphere is cozy and comfortable, and the food rocks.  Don't wait in line for the yucky stuff.  Go to a local chef-owned restaurant like Flancer's.  You'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"This is a local place... Not a franchise. Prices are not cheap but the food is good and the staff is friendly. Hubby and I have been going for several years. Tip: if ordering the fondue appetizer, tell them to toast the bread. They'll do it. I like chili Philly cheese steak sandwich. The filet mignon sandwich is tasty too! Good pizza as well. Hubby typically gets the prickly pear sandwich. Small business"}
{"text":"Flancers is excellent for lunch.  They get out quickly. Their aces of clubs will the best.  Prickly pear chicken is excellent also.  They are also very friendly with great service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and to try something new for lunch. The staff was very friendly and patient with me looking over the menu. I took the waiters advice and decided to try the prickly pear chicken sandwich with a side of the green chili mac. Now, I was hesitant about this chicken sandwich.... I mean, prickly pear, what does that even mean? But take it from me... it is a must try. I brought the sandwich to my mouth and instantly feel in love. It is by far the most interesting chicken sandwich I've ever had. Is one of those things I can't explain WHY, all I can do is tell you that you will love it. The beer was great. The green chili mac was interesting as well, but delicious. I have just found my new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"arg.  We've been coming here for over 10 years and today we ordered one of our typical sandwiches and very disappointed with the size of the sandwich.  It shrunk by 50%... It was like kiddie size and the price was still the same.  Hopefully they aren't shrinking the sandwich size.."}
{"text":"Cute place.  Good service.  Clean. 
two sandwiches ordered.  Braise the lord which was supposed to be roast with a horseradish sauce and coleslaw.  Sounds good but was a horrible mess of stuff.  Wet warm sloppy cabbage on meat that was too seasoned.  Something green and mushy on the bread that looked like parsley??  Seriously the WORST sandwich I have ever tried to eat.  The other sandwich was a chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato.  Decent.  Slim on meat -- less than 3 ounces of meat for sure.  Sides, macaroni and cheese was good.  The other side, Jalepeno mashed was just ok.  I wouldn't order it again.  I did not try the pizza -- next time I will.  The sandwich (beef) was so terrible I should lower my stars but to be fair, the food coming out of the kitchen looked really good and the place was very busy so I think I just got a bum plate.  It was clean and like I said, the service was good so I will try them again."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Flancers for over 15 years and I am not sure if the quality of food and the portion size gas gotten smaller or if all their competition near this location is just that much better but every time I go to Flancers I leave being disappointed.  I think I have finally learned my lesson and goodbye Flancers.  RIP"}
{"text":"At first, going to Flancer's was the kids' choice. Now the adults even suggest this restaurant for dinner. There are two Flancer's, one on Higley and one on Gilbert. We have been to both, but we frequent the one on Higley. Its always busy yet you never have to wait too long for a table. The booths are huge and can accommodate your parties easily. 
     The atmosphere is very laid back and there's always good tunes flowing. The old concert posters on the wall are a nice touch.
     If you have never tried anything prickly pear before, you've got to have the chicken. The perfect prickly pear chicken salad or sandwich is a sure bet. They also have homemade lemonade that is amazing. All the sandwiches appetizers and desserts are fantastic here. You really need more than one visit to be able to try other things, such as the \"We must meat, I ain't lion\" , \"Steak it to the limit\" or the \"Let it B.L.T.\". The green Chile mayo is a must, as is the goat cheese bruschetta appetizer.
     The service is always great. After a million years of coming here, we've never had a bad experience.  I will say that we ordered their Thanksgiving meal to go package one year and were underwhelmed. But that's not the everyday stuff, so we don't hold it against them! We will come here forever."}
{"text":"Been eating here for about 10 years now and it's always consistently good, great place to bring family & friends.  From the Prickly Pear Chicken, Pastrami, Pizza, Burgers, Fresh Salads, & Spiked Lemonade it's all good and we have always had good service.  My only complaint would be that they got rid of their Russian salad dressing..."}
{"text":"To put things lightly, I LOVE Flancers! like, legitimately LOVE this place. The food comes out perfect every single time I've eaten here. 

- I usually stick to beer, but one night our waitress talked me into trying their Spiked Prickley Pear Lemonade and it was wonderful! My favorite food items are: The Goat to Have it Salad, Vibes of Veggie Wrap, Ace of Clubs Sandwich, the Prickly Pear Sandwich, their Philly Cheesesteak, The Roadhouse Pizza, their Mozzarella Triangles for an Appetizer, & the half baked cookie w/ ice cream for dessert. Basically, order anything & you'll be happy. 

- You will notice the manager doing tasks like running food, bussing tables, seating guests, basically making sure every guest is happy. That's something I greatly appreciate. 

- The restaurant is 60's/70's rock themed & the staff is very laid back. I've come in looking rough after a night of drinking, as well as in my Sunday best after church. No judgment zone. 

I would recommend Flancers for anything from a first date, to a family dinner."}
{"text":"This place you have to pay an arm and a leg for a sub sandwich and give your first born"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! I seriously eat there about 4 times a month. I went the first time because I thought it looked like some place different to try. I ordered the \"It's About Thyme\" sandwich..... LOVE!!! This is the best sandwich I have ever had EVER! I recommend it to everyone who likes mushrooms. 

Anyway, the staff is friendly. The place is clean. They have now opened two locations and it is always hoppin.... probably because people love it so much :)

Other things I have tried:
Appetizers :  Mushroom Phylos :), Bruchetta :)
Sides: Fries ...yum!
Drinks: Homemade Lemonade (Hits the spot), Hard Lemonade -Double Yum!!"}
{"text":"so - my girlfriend works for a doctor in Mesa, and a Big Pharma rep had lunch catered in from Flancers for the whole office, and Bae raved about the food  - said everything was just amazing - soup, salads, bread, sandwiches, and dessert.
I was out in east valley thursday, and stopped at the Flancers in Gilbert - I had a Philly cheese-steak and fries.  And I swear, it was the second-best Cheese-steak I ever had, just behind one from this joynt in Chicago by the Merchandise Mart that made theirs with thin-sliced ribeye steak - at about twice the price of Flancers.
The fries were crisp and well-done just like I asked for, and the coffee was fresh and excellent.  Great service, happy and friendly waitrons, and I loved the album cover art on the walls
As Ahnuld said - \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"I was in East Valley for a meeting and stopped here for a dinner carryout.  I got the Italian hoagie and it was terrific - great fresh bread, excellent quality meats and cheeses, crisp marinated onions, and a container of Italian  dressing for dipping; sandwich also came with a side of roasted veggies which were perfect - crisp-tender and great  flavor.
For dessert I got a Peanut butter chocolate oatmeal bar that was really WOW; never had  anything like that before.
Talked to Chef Greg while I waited and  he told me about Jeff Flancer and the CIA training that  helped create the restaurant themes and also about the  community events and  charity work they do - this is why I do NOT go to chain restaurants; I always support independent and family-owned businesses - they give back so much to the community.
Thank you Flancer's - I'll be   back"}
{"text":"It's a shame I haven't eaten here in a while because the food is great!  It's a quaint cafe with excellent pizza and sandwiches. The interior is cozy with old album covers on the walls and the servers are super friendly.  They also have outdoor seating available.  It  can get crowded at lunch time so plan ahead.

If you are in the area I highly recommend you trying it."}
{"text":"This was a good option to order take out while in that area. We had lunch take out and it was good food but i was underwhelmed with the menu. I had not been there in a while and they have changed their menu since. It was so so and they got rid of my favorite pasta dishes. Their sandwiches are very good though if you like sandwich/subs. The hatch green chili was a good addition to the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"This place has shockingly great sandwiches and always friendly service. The draft beer menu is a little limited, but the super yummy food more than makes up for it ;) If you come for lunch, get here early because the place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food... can't believe I didn't discover this place sooner... definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience,  we've been coming for years.   Lots of variety to choose from whatever your mood."}
{"text":"We split the goat cheese burger and their version of a Margherita pizza. The burger was amazing, the pizza was flavorless and entirely forgettable. I would definitely go regularly to try other non-pizza items if we lived there. The decor was kitschy and not at all fitting with the menu."}
{"text":"3 1/2 Stars...first time here! Atmosphere is lacking but if you want a good sandwich this is the place in Mesa. Really good Turkey sandwich...REAL turkey breast...not deli thin sliced turkey. Wonderful green chili mayo on homemade bread. Yum!! Sweet potato fries really good. Strawberry/peach cobbler w/ice cream was really tasty...not too sweet. Ordered the spiked fresh squeezed lemonade w/prickly pear syrup and vodka. Unfortunately, they really skimped on the vodka!
Will definitely return but will ask that they actually put some vodka in the lemonade."}
{"text":"We used Flancer's to cater a lunch for 20 - 25 today.  We have used them before for other events and their sandwiches and salads are always a hit.  Today was no different - everything was fresh and delicious.  This is not your typical boring \"chain\" sandwich shop - 200% better!  You can bet that we will call on Flancer's again."}
{"text":"Oh how I love Flancer's.  I love the thyme sandwich and salad.  The lion sandwich.  Pasta.  Appetizers are really great. We head over there any chance we get and I alwys recommend to all my friends. No I don't work for them. I'm serious. The it's about thyme sandwich is what I asked for after I had my 5th child. Yep. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was good but the waitress was super rude, we have to ask for disposable spoons because one the spoons we were handed to eat our  dessert was dirty (clearly licked) yikes, they brough the plastic spoons but not even a word of apology.  We will try Mesa location and hope for better experience."}
{"text":"I'm sad to do this review because I've come here for the reason Ive been coming here for years both locations and this isn't the review I wanted to leave. We got to the restaurant about 735pm and it was not busy 3 tables. By the time We ordered 2 other tables were finished. After we ordered another table came and ordered about 15 mins after we ordered. I look at the clock at 835 thinking geez for a pizza it sure is  taking too long. About 10 mins after that the table that came in after us a table of 4 got their meals. She then came to our table and told us it would be 5 more mins if we wanted salads while we waited. At this time it's been over an hour. Thinking it would be 5 mins we said no 10 mins go by still no food. She comes to tell us that he burnt our first pizza and is making us a 2nd and that they are really sorry. Well the food finally came and it was good up until I found a hair in my pizza. Nasty! Never again. Kourtney was kind but what an awful time and then to have a hair after a 2 hour dinner . Not happy."}
{"text":"The prickly pear and I ain't lion sandwiches bring hope for future world peace. Only love can exist when eating those masterpieces!!"}
{"text":"By far one of my fav lunch places ever!! Try the Goat to Have It salad. You won't regret it!  The Vibes of Veggie sandwich is also delicious.  They make their bread in house and you can totally tell.  Makes my mouth water just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location and the one in Mesa and they both serve up some good food. The service is efficient and I have never had any problems. For lunchtime,  Its About Thyme wrap is my favorite followed by the prickly pear caesar salad.  Dinner time, Miso Salmon is great. The record album collection is rather eclectic from John Lee Hooker to Metallica! Good beer selections. The parking can be a bit challenging up front but there is room towards the back of the lot usually."}
{"text":"Best Cheesestake in AZ because of the bread I own Windy City Cafe and its better than Ours.  Good Job Guys"}
{"text":"I had no idea about this place!! It was delicious! I had the ace of clubs with jalapeño mashed cake. The flavors were fantastic. I wish the ham/ turkey were sliced thinner (I'm not a fan of really thick cut lunch meat. I think thinner would balance flavor and have a better visual appearance thank a giant easter style ham slice sticking out) but the green chili mayo is spot on. I think the fries would have been a better compliment but I'm glad I tried the mashed thing. I started with the French onion soup which was also very good!! My daughter ordered a salad with warm vinegrette, it was very very vinegary and not very sweet. They were very accommodating and offered to take off bill. I can't wait to go back. It's just down the street from us. Hoping this is our new \"go to\" place. :)"}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short and sweet. The only thing I can say about Flancers is that Flancers is AWESOME. By far the best lunch spot in town. The one in Gilbert is small and gets packed for lunch. The staff at the Gilbert location is awesome I feel like Norm from cheers when I walk in. Big Myke, Ben, Thomas and everyone else treat the customers of Flancers like they are their best friends.

Must have are: Best Cheesesteak in town, the It's About Tyme Sandwich, Pizza, and the french fries. 

I really wish there was a Flancers in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheese sandwich ever!!! Tried a few other items that were great but go back for the Philly every time."}
{"text":"Oh my...Flancer's is delicious! After a vegan meal for breakfast and a long day of car shopping, the family and I decided we needed a burger for dinner.  Couldn't have chosen a better place.  My burger was delicious and cooked perfectly.  The fries are beer battered and delicious as well.  We went in for burgers but fell in love with their menu...so many delicious sounding items! We've already decided that we'll be back for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Yum!!"}
{"text":"We were expecting a lot better than we got. Had to send the Onion Soup back for another microwave heating. I have never had an Onion Soup Philly Cheese steak until today. Guess that's what happens when the steak to onions ratio is 50 - 50. No silverware on the table, but my wife's onion soup came with a spoon. My fries were OK, nothing special. Best tasting pickle I have had in a while. Flancer's goes on the BTDT (Been That, Done There)  list and we are still looking for a really good cheese steak in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My wife & I dropped by for lunch the other day & we thoroughly enjoyed it - it was the Flancers we loved so much in the past.  Although I've always had the prickly pear sandwich in the past, we're both trying to eat a little healthier so we both had salads;. My wife had the green with prickly pear & I had the Cesar with prickly pear.  The chicken was moist and ver flavorful.  Both excellent salads.  Needless to say, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The only problem is I have a hard time choose which meal to order.  It is a staple."}
{"text":"Had the Cure Heaven Pastrami lettuce wrap and it was amazing!!!! So happy that they have a diet menu with so many options including calorie total. One request - open one in North Phoenix so I can eat here more!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Flancers! Service is always great and so is the food! Never a complaint. Love how they do special meals for holidays and the decor makes this one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"The service at Flancers is great! I put in an order to go and they were very friendly and prompt. I had the prickly pair chicken in a whole wheat wrap. It was very tasty! I did feel the prices were a bit steep,  but their food was good."}
{"text":"First visit to Flancer's was to meet a couple of friends for lunch on a Saturday.  Had the lunch combo of Goat to Have It salad and Prickly Pear chicken sandwich.  So wanted to love the goat cheese salad, but it wasn't very flavorful and left me a bit disappointed.  Same goes for the Prickly Pear sandwich.  Meal was fine, but nothing to write home about... Won't need to go back."}
{"text":"Got their philly cheese steak and their green chili mac and cheese. Both were very good. The bread was moist and fresh and everything was very flavorful. I will come here again! Great wait staff and very hospitable atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We love our flancers.  Prickly pear sandwich is unbeatable...and the service usually is right on."}
{"text":"Flancer's has some amazing food! I have always had the Chile Verde Birdie with fries. This sandwich is so delicious!! They use freshly carved turkey and the green chili mayo has the right amount of kick. The French fries are the best I have had anywhere. The fries are crisp yet tender inside.

My husband always gets the Prickly Pear Chicken Sandwich and raves about it every time.

If the restaurant is busy it is extremely loud and very hard to have a conversation with the person(s) you are having a meal with. I would recommend trying to visit during the slow hours."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT!  HANDS DOWN!  When friends/relatives come to visit; this is the first place we go.  I love the Two Tickets to paradise sandwich, the chili verde birdie and the peach cobbler!  LOVE LOVE LOVE FLANCERS!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food and service! We tried the turkey, bacon, alvacado sandwich with green chile mayo... So awesome! Get the side of green chile Mac and cheese to round out an awesome spicy meal!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's so close to my house that I find myself coming here once a month.

I love the fact that they let you order 1/2 sandwiches. I can NEVER finish huge meals at restaurants, and I hate having to bring home leftovers.

Maybe it's just the time of day I usually come here (weekday, 1-3pm) but it's always empty. Makes me pretty sad actually! Hopefully they are busier around dinner time.

I've heard that their desserts are awesome, but have never personally tried any of them. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too concerned about their lack of courtesy and I chose to ignore the unwelcoming (mostly indifferent) employees, but what really got me was the ...not one -but two- hairs found in my food. Nasty! I politely asked that the dish (philly cheesesteak) be removed from the bill, since I was obviously disgusted and not going to eat the rest. When I looked at the bill I realized they removed only the main price but not the $2 for the additional toppings. Uncalled for. All of it should have been removed! Even if this didn't happen, I have to say the food was nothing I'd be back for. I was thoroughly disappointed considering I had read good reviews. I also think it's in poor taste to add 18% gratuity when it was two adults and a few kids; especially considering the waiter never once refilled our drinks or did anything other than to take the order and bring the food. He didn't even have to bring the bill to the table! (We were waiting so long, we just decided to head to the front and ask for it). All in all, it was just a bad/overpriced experience for nastiness (hair), food that wasn't anything special, and service that was far from good. Like someone else said, they didn't even bother to say thx or come again or anything when leaving. Not that it would have made me come back! Also, the restaurant was filthy. The bathrooms were pretty gross and I got a sneak peak at the kitchen while entering the restroom and I was no longer surprised to have found the hairs in my food. Would not recommend this place to anyone who has expectations of decent food and sanitary conditions or friendly service. This is a NO GO."}
{"text":"Had an all meat calzone that was really good.  They used a lot of ricotta cheese in it which brought a nice balance to the usual overwhelming taste of the normal ingredients in a calzone."}
{"text":"Went looking for a Philly cheese-steak. Walked away with so much more! The philly was truly delicious.  They hyped up the bread a lot and it lived up to it.  The philly had a great balance of cheese/meat/veggie goodness. I like cheesy steaks and usually find myself needing to get extra cheese, but not here. Though I might away, just for giggles. 

Since the order was to go, they recommended the green chili mac and cheese because \"it travels better.\" First off, kudos to them for being THAT attentive. Secondly, I'd recommend the mac and cheese no matter where you eat it.   

I also had the wings (just had to). I went for a medium buffalo and took the suggestion of adding the prickly pear sauce to them - DO THIS! The flavors mixed incredibly well, and the heat was just right. 

This is a place to return to again, and again."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place. My go to is the philly with their fresh squeezed lemonade"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Mesa! We came here with a big group and everything we got was awesome. The fries and the prickly pear chicken sandwich were the best. Seriously, order the prickly pear chicken sandwich! Atmosphere is casual and cool. Also, service was quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"Not only did they have excellent food, they also had great service. We were there with my 8-year old daughter, who has food allergies. We asked the waitress a question about one of the menu items being gluten free, and she brought over a gluten free menu! Then, she offered a plate of gluten free bread to go with the fondue we ordered, and it was the softest, best tasting gluten free bread I've ever had. Their pizza is also quite good. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was really good! Quality Bread for the sandwich I ordered! Friendly staff and great lemonade."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but burger was SUPER greasy. Dessert (chocolate peanut butter pretzel pie) was delicious."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to eat.  They have a wide assortment of sandwiches, with the yummiest homemade bread Ever!! I recommend the Prickley Pear Chicken for a change of pace.  They also have delicious soups that change regularly.  Best part is--they are local and they support locals too!"}
{"text":"I had the pastrami and it was great! I like the twist they give it with the green chilies in it and it make an awesome spicy sandwich. My kids had the Italian hoagie and it was also made just right. The bread is made in house and it was really good!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning with my mom at Flancers in Mesa. What a wonderful experience!  The food was exceptional. We both had the smothered burrito and it was delicious!  The green sauce on the side was a good choice for us as we are gringos lol. But it has wonderful flavor. 
The service was very pleasant. We were visited by the manager, served by the assistant GM and even got to visit with the cook. I can't say enough about how wonderful Flancers is. It will be our new breakfast place on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, made with freshly baked bread and high quality ingredients.  I tried some of the Philly sandwich, which was a little smaller than I thought it would be, but was very flavorful with great tender beef.  I had the \"You Talkin' to Me\" sandwich, which included fresh mozzarella, balsamic vinegar, tomatoes, mushrooms, roasted red pepper, greens, and caramelized onions.  Each ingredient was excellent and meshed well with the others.  

The vibe here is small diner-esque, with classic rock albums lining the walls and classic hits playing on the speaker system.  I'd definitely like to come here again, maybe to try their happy hour as well as their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The food quality was amazing, but the service wasn't the best. The Philly cheesesteak was amazing and so was their pizza. I would recommend friends and family to come to this establishment."}
{"text":"Usually go to the Gilbert location but at Mesa today, 2 of our 3 orders were wrong orders completely . I was bringing people that had never been and doubt they'll go back. Not happy."}
{"text":"Four of us went here today for lunch.  We've probably been to Flancer's 4-5 times and have always previously thought their food is well above average, and the service was fine to good.  Today, there were multiple issues.  The place was fairly busy, but it's quite small, so it should be very manageable for the wait staff.  

The waitress initially greeeted us and went right into \"are you ready to order?\" in 15 seconds.  We had literally just sat down and hadn't looked at the menus yet.  After asking her to give us a minute to decide, she took forever to come back and get the order.  We placed the order and then waited, I'd guess, 35-40 minutes to get the food.  3 of us 4 ordered hot dishes.....they all came to the table cold....I'd guess that they had been sitting out for at least 15 minutes, so there's why it took so long for us to get them.  Clearly, the kitchen had gotten it out in a timely manner, so things broke down after that.

After we sent them back to be re-heated, the waitress' attitude began to deteriorate.  Another waiter came back with the re-heated foods, and all of the sides were mixed up with with the entrees....we had to re-plate all of the meals ourselves.  Not to mention, one of the sides didn't come back at all, so we had to inform him that we were still waiting on a plate of fries.  After that, the waitress never returned to check on us....we had to flag her down to let her know that we were ready for the check (we had been done eating for quite some time) and she gave a look of irritation.  

After another long wait, we got the bill and took it up to the register to pay, as did many of the other guests, because we figured it would be faster than waiting on our waitress to process it.  We were in line with four other groups who wanted to pay, but no one was manning the register.  A waiter finally came up and asked all of the various groups if we were ready to be seated!  After informing him that we all had already eaten and needed to pay, someone manned the register and we finally made our way out.

Total time at the restaurant...mind you we all had easy things like club sandwiches....2 HOURS!  

Not once did I see a manager in the place.....no one was running the place.....

One of the many irritated customers asked to speak to a manager at one point (there were service issues all over the place), so another waiter was sent over to their table.  The customer said \"I asked for a manager\" and the waiter said \"I'm it\".

This ship was sailing without a captain today......and it was sinking fast.  

As we were leaving, I saw our original waitress walking out of the restaurant in a hurry....her body language suggested that she might have been walking out/quit, but I can't be sure.....maybe she was just going to her car to get something, but I don't think so....

The food was good, but with all of these issues, I'm guessing we won't be back for quite some time, if ever.  There are just too many other choices with good service....I hope for their sake this was a one-day issue and not an ongoing problem"}
{"text":"The prickly pear sandwich so so bomb!!! Like best thing since sliced bread bomb! That being said a coworker and I order online once a week and pick it up, the manager is usually super nice, today he was horrible! Like I won't go back horrible. Customer service is key for me. Treat me like I'm stupid and I don't care how good your food is, if you're rude to me I'll Pinterest the recipe and do it myself!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place! We've been going here since they opened about 15 years ago. They are known for their sandwiches on home made bread but their pizza is also great. Hamburgers are always cooked to perfection. Love you Flancers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Flancer's for the first time today.  We were looking for a new place to try and found this place on Yelp.  From start to finish, we were VERY happy and we WILL be back!  The steak and cheese sandwich is melt-in-your mouth goodness!!!!!!  I hope I can make myself try other things here next time but I'll be craving that sandwich for quite a while!!  My husband had the BLT and was still talking about how good it was a few hours after lunch.  :-)  The bread is top notch, crazy-good and everyone who lives in Arizona knows how hard it is to find really good bread out in a restaurant.  The service, from the greeting, to the table, to the exit left an impression on us and just adds to many of the reasons that we can't wait to go back!!  Thank you, Flancer's and keep up the quality food, ingredients, and fantastic service!!!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here if you're watching the calories'! 

Prickly Pear Marinade Chicken Sandwich I added a side of jalapeño MAC and cheese.  Rich and a bit spicy.  What a great combo.   


Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich was good with generous portion of beef and cheese,  get the works with peppers and onions. 

Cobbler and 3 drinks 

Our total bill was $61.23 includes tip.  I thought this was a little pricey for a dive place like this."}
{"text":"The salmon burger is delicious! I also recommend the green chili Mac and cheese as a side."}
{"text":"My husband and came here on a recommendation from a friend. The food is awesome and Yasiman our sever was perfect! She made some great suggestions and the best sever we have ever had.  We will definitely be back, and will tell our friends about it also!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Flancers was terrible. Our food took over 45 minutes to come out. We kept being told that it was being plated but I'm pretty sure it doesn't take that long to make two chicken sandwiches (unless they kill the chickens before each sandwich). While we were waiting I asked for some carrots for my baby to chew on. The waitress didn't bring them until we got our food (45 mins after we ordered it). They did comp one of the sandwiches because of the wait but they charged us 3 freaking dollars for carrots for our baby to chew on! We were very disappointed and probably will not come back."}
{"text":"I really like Flancers. I stopped in and had a tenderloin salad with Gorgonzola. It was incredibly good. The small was almost to large. I'm afraid the large would be to big. That's not a bad thing. For Thanksgiving I ordered a Thanksgiving To-Go pre-order. Not exactly what my mom would make. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. The Diestel turkey  although moist, wasn't very flavorful. The gravy was adequate although a little more would have been better. The sage apple dressing was good as were the potato pies. I would have preferred mashed potatoes or at least have then offered them as an option. The roasted brussel sprouts were cooked way to long. After the reheating process they were mush. I am not a big cranberry fan but I tried some; bitter. Maybe that's correct. The cobbler was spectacular, the home made whip cream was also very good. Four stars, this was not an epic meal. I can't wait to stop in for another salad."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to come when we are feeling like a good sandwich. Great service, we aren't beer drinkers but our friends that are love their selection. Their homemade lemon aid is the bomb!"}
{"text":"The cheesesteak is always good. This time my wife ordered the macaroni and it was delicious with the green chile in it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and ordered the Prickly Pear Chicken sandwich both times because it is so good. You really won't find another place that prepares their chicken like this, so I don't mind spending the extra money on that one sandwich. Other highlights include their fresh baked baguette and incredibly fresh salad options. I can't fully recommend all of their sides, though the Jalapeño Cheddar Potato Pie is both unique and delicious. Service was fast and friendly, I just can't give this place a higher recommendation because the price is a bit too high for what you're getting."}
{"text":"Probably the best chicken sandwich i ever had.  When in Chandler, its my to go place."}
{"text":"Ok! Stopped by because of yelp's reviews and close by.  It was packed at lunchtime and they only had one table left when I walked in.  I took it. Fast service & very polite & helpful.  Lunch came in a very timely manner and presentation was great.  I had a Guac and Roc burger as did my friend & they were great! Yummy! stop by..."}
{"text":"Went to flancer's tonight using the coupon from the entertainment book.  We had a party of three, a bit crowded during happy hour with lots of regulars.  We skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entrees.  The lentil bean soup was very tasty as was the veggie vibe sandwich with cole slaw.  I opted for the Veg Out pizza which was a white pizza with roasted tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, pesto sauce and mozzarella ant goat cheese.  It was awesome on fresh home made pizza dough.  It was better than the pizza places in town.  For the three entrees with two drinks including the $8.00 off coupon without tip the late lunch came just under $35.00 before tip.  Lisa the wait staff was amazing.  Good place to go for some home made bread and good quality food."}
{"text":"Great local find as we visited Flancer's for the first time this evening.  We had seen this restaurant on the local PBS affiliate's \"Check Please\" program earlier this year and we were impressed by the accolade's that the show's guests gave this locally owned eatery.  Flancer's lived up to its billing tonight!  Their menu has something for everyone from appetizers to daily specials to Happy Hour specials to sandwiches to pastas to desserts.  I had the Philly Beef Steak sandwich and it was the best one I have eaten this side of Philadelphia!  My friend had the Filet Mignon sandwich and he sang its praises!  We had the mild, boneless Buffalo chicken wings for an appetizer and they were delicious, too.

EXCELLENT service from Lisa.  General Manager Greg Ringel greeted us at the door and was very welcoming to these two Flancer's newcomers.  I will soon be a regular as there were many things on their menu now that I am eager to go back and to try!

Visit their website at www.flancers.com."}
{"text":"We took our groupon here and had a good experience. Only reason it's not 5 is because of how rushed the experience was. We went around lunch time on a weekday and had a 15 minutes wait and then waiting about 5-10 minutes before we were asked for drink/appetizer orders. 
The food was all perfect. We had the goat cheese bruchetta that was heavenly! Boyfriend and I shared the Prickly Pear chicken sandwhich and WOW...I had no idea such wonderful flavors come from the desert :)  Boyfriend also got a soup of the day Sausage Minestrone, which was also spot on! The sandwhich came with a side and we tried the jalepeno cheddar potato pie (based on yelp recommendation) and I was impressed by the great combo of flavors. 
I will definitely go back!!! Advice: avoid peak eating times if you don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and service here. The best sandwich shop in America. Myke and his staff treat you like family"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever. Other items on the menu such as pizza , pasta and salads not to mention the dessert are great as well. But the sandwiches are the main highlight of this gem in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!  After many years and many visits here at Flancer's, I am finally writing a review!  I Tried the Goat Cheese Bruchetta today for the first time and gobbled it up!!  So tasty!! Their bread is so incredibly fresh and delish!!  The Philly Cheese Steak with the Works is by far my favorite go-to item!!  Along with many other patrons in the restaurant today!! Every table had at least one on their table. The beer battered fries are one of the best French Fries I have ever had!!  Super crunchy and delicious!!  Our server Ben was super prompt and friendly with our order and special requests.  I would definitely recommend this quaint gem of a restaurant right on the north end of Downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich, I had the Pastrami sandwich and my husband had the Philly cheese steak husband.  Both sandwiches had deliocious soft fresh bread.  We opted fo the half sandwich with salad.  Salad was fresh and plentiful.   I also had the prickly pear lemonade.  Final answer all was delicious!"}
{"text":"I have always heard about this place and how great it was. I finally went and I had the veggie vibe sandwich. All of the vegetables had a great marinade, very tasty. Their sweet potato fries are great, in between soggy and crunchy. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great food. Just visiting from Seattle and the \"prickly chicken\" has me ready for the whole AZ experience."}
{"text":"We found this gem a few years ago and we have made it a one of our go to places. Food is always great, atmosphere is good and the staff is fabulous! My personal favorite is getting the Philly steak salad!  My husband and I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches and fries don't get any better!  Homemade bread, beer battered fries...and the nicest servers around. Oh, and HUGE cups with speedy refills IF you ever need them.

The Gilbert location is small and nothing fancy - but it's always a good time at Flancers!  The Mesa location (newer, bigger - not as good food IMO)

I almost always get the Prickly Pear sandwhich - - they marinate the chicken in some secret sauce and it is just so so good.  My husband almost always gets the Phily cheesesteak which he says is one of the best he's ever had.

Sometimes there is a wait and be advised, the waiting area is usually OUTSIDE. But if you must cram with the other patrons in the AC, they will be awesome Gilbert folks so it isn't all that bad:)"}
{"text":"Great family sit down eats. Nothing fancy here, seating is limited. But their place is clean and what they lack in fancy decor they more than make up with a great menu, and more importantly (for me) is great, friendly service. 
Sandwiches are the big thing here and I enjoyed their award winning Turkey Chile sandwich. While my wife had a sauteed chicken and portabello mushroom sandwich, which is what I'm going to order next time, it was very tasty! All the sandwiches come with a choice of sides in case your in the mood for something healthier that the standard fries. 
We are definitely coming back. Initially,  I though they were priced on the high side ($8 - $10 for a sandwich) but after the meal I changed my mind."}
{"text":"So good....I was impressed. There are so many sandwich joints these days, it is hard to find the good ones. Flancer's makes it happen! Nice menu with lot's of options....Yum! Go there!"}
{"text":"One of our \"go to\" destinations.  We have been going to Flancer's for years.  They food is great and the staff is always super helpful."}
{"text":"Ahhh, Flancer's Cafe.  You're filled with cute boys who serve me.  You offer a bunch of tasty sandwiches that become two meals for me because they are so large.  And apparently, you have amazing pizza.  Hurrah.
I tried the \"No Bones About it\" (All the food has cute names!) sandwich, which is Boneless Buffalo Chicken with lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheddar.  It comes on amazing bread.  The kind that is slightly crisp on the outside and delightfully soft on the inside, but with substance.  None of that wonderbread crap.  It's a huge sandwich - which is about $7.50 if I'm remembering correctly.  They'll turn the sandwich into a \"meal combo\" for four additional dollars, which would include a fountain drink and a side like fries or soup or potato salad.  However, I recommend sharing a large fry with a friend if you go, because that's only like $2.50 or something.  (I tend to just drink water so it would make my bill cheaper....I dunno about yours haha).  The staff is prompt, friendly and funny.  A nice little place down the street from my parents house =)"}
{"text":"Love Flancers. Even better since they expanded. Food is great, service is friendly and prices are reasonable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Although the portions have shrunk as the prices have gone up, Flancer's still delivers on flavor and a new twist on old favorites. Instead of going out on Friday night for a mediocre fish fry 
CHECK OUT TUESDAY NIGHT FISH FRY
We've searched high and low for a good one nearby to where we live and this is it. Crunchy without being greasy, they offer a homespun spicy tartar sauce that is truly addictive. While i wanted more fries with that I certainly didn't need any more, and we skipped on the apple cinnamon bread pudding (oh my.)
We expect to continue to make it a date with them for many a Tuesday night to come. 
You can get cheaper.
You can get more expensive.
You can't get better.
Thanks for a very pleasant meal, guys!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Flancer's several times a month for years. We have always found the staff to be attentive and friendly.  The food always hits the spot! Real tasty comfort food. We take all our out of town visitors here and will continue to. You must have the goat cheese bruschetta, but really you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This local Gilbert establishment has never disappointed me over the past five years I have been going there. My wife and I will stop there on a weekend afternoon for lunch and always walk away happy. I like to try something different whenever I go and always enjoy what I have. The staff are always friendly, the food is always good, and I am supporting a local restaurant; it doesn't get much better than that. I love the French Fries, they are seasoned really well. The lemonade is homemade and very good. Yeah Flancers!

P.S. They opened a Second location in North Mesa...1902 N. Higley Rd."}
{"text":"Had the prickly pear chicken per everyone's recommendation, and it didn't disappoint. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Pasta is great and the chicken with the cactus pear sandwich is great also.  The service is good if you dine in, when ever I order food to go ( I work really long days) it's always missed up and when I call the best they can offer me is driving back. 

I give food and dining inside 5 stars. 

Take out 2 stars."}
{"text":"We were delighted with the whole experience. ...the food is awesome!  Started with the broccoli-cheddar soup and it was so creamy and good. Hubby had the Thyme chicken and I tried the Cubano with a side of green chile Mac& Cheese
The pork was perfect and we both just drooled over the Baguettes!  He loved his sandwich and fries, even allowed me a taste. No complaints about the service either. Our server was Ray,and he was excellent. 
All things considered, we would recommend this for a great sandwich and Pizza place
We love it! And will try it again"}
{"text":"I have driven by Flancer's so many times and said \"I need to try that place\" to myself every time I do.  Well the time finally came!  My friend Robyn N. had a Groupon and invited me to luch. For some reason I was thinking it was a tad more upscale than it actually is but that's not a bad thing.  I only really say the front half of the restaurant because we were seated just inside the door. It's sort of a divey little place with the kitchen visable as you walk in. It could be a little cleaner for my taste. Don't get me wrong, we didn't stick to the table or the seats but I then I grew up with a mom who was a little OCD and our kitchen floor was so clean you could eat off of it.  The service was fast and friendly.  We had the goat cheese bruscheta and it was yummy!!!  There were 5 good size slices.  That was pleanty to share.  For lunch I tried the cheesesteak.  Oh so good!!  The bread was so fresh and yummy and the cheesesteak had great flavor.  The cheese was nicely melted and the meat was tender.  I also had sweet potato fries that were a lovely crispy treat!  Will I go back....you bet!  I won't be so apt to drive right by now."}
{"text":"My friend Robyn N. had a Groupon for Flancer's so we met up for lunch.  I had been to the Gilbert location so I wanted to see how this location was in comparison.  I think I like the set up of this location.  It seems more open than the Gilbert site.  And ever since I had the cheese steak I have been dreaming about it.  I'm not sure I would have the pizza here as it looks just average.  The sandwiches are really the highlight here.  The cheese steak can be ordered several different ways.  You can add mushrooms, bell peppers, or green chilis.  I had mine with green chili this time around and it gave it a nice little zing.  The meat is so tender and the bread is nice and fresh.  I have sweet potato fries and they were cooked perfectly.  We had service with a smile too.  I will be back for another cheese steak soon!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice.  The 1st time I wanted to give it 5 stars & my wife leaned towards 4 stars.  Very nice ma & pa type place, friendly staff, fairly quick service, excellent selections.  The second time we went back the food was far less desirable, maybe it was the cook, I don't know.  I will probably go back again, I really Want to think the 2nd visit was the fluke and not the 1st visit."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great- the food that is. The service was five star all the way and Yasiman deserves a raise! Hubby and I decided to take a ride and chose Flancer's based on these five star ratings. Of course, I had to try the Chile Chicken Verde and the Caesar with prickly pear chicken (two birds, one stone thing) and hubby had the pastrami.  The prickly pear chicken reminds me of teriyaki, and for me that is just too sweet. It was, however, exceptionally moist and there was a LOT of chicken on the small salad. The bread was fresh but that chicken sandwich lacked some flavor, even after the extra green chile mayo. Maybe if I had asked for it hot, it would have worked better for me.The meals were good but not mind blowing, maybe expectations were just too high. I would go back, but wouldn't ride the 30 miles out of my way again."}
{"text":"~~~sticker shock~~~

Three of us ate here and we all really enjoyed our sandwiches...in fact they were darn good!

                                     ~~~sticker shock~~~

We passed the sandwiches around and shared so we could all try each others.  The prime rib was very good (no sticker shock for a prime rib sandwich), the club was very good and the patty melt was very good.

                                    ~~~sticker shock~~~

The bread was very good and all the ingredients were high quality.

                                   ~~~sticker shock~~~

A soda is nearly $2.50 and we got nickeled and dimed a bit...leading to us trying to figure out how 3 sandwiches and 2 sodas came to nearly $40 bucks!

{"text":"Flancers is great! My husband and I go here anytime we are having a craving for a delicious sandwich. We have 2 favorites and give each other the other half of our sandwiches. My favorite is the \"its about thyme\" chicken sandwich. Chicken, sauteed mushrooms and yummy yummy yummy basil mayo. It will blow your mind. My husbands favorite is the prickly pear sandwich. It has flavor unlike any other. A true AZ original. Its a smaller space so probably not great for large crowds but great for a dinner or lunch date with your friends or family."}
{"text":"I do love their food but it seems like they've made their portions much smaller. We typically order out since their service is a bit slow when dining in. My co-worker and I used to be able to share their large salad and order their garlic cheese bread on the side but that's not the case anymore. For the price, I'm not thrilled that they've made the portion smaller."}
{"text":"Really great fondue appetizer. Nice atmosphere. I like having a non chain, sit down casual restaurant in the ne valley"}
{"text":"Fantastically excellent sandwiches, each with more character, flavor, spices, and herbs than at a run-of-the-mill sandwich place. The fresh-squeezed lemonade involves the harming of actual lemons and is not to be missed."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. 
The \"Chile Verde Birdie\" is my favorite sandwich. There is a very wide variety of items on the menu to suit any taste.
The service is always very good, polite and welcoming. They always have great music playing! Today was a very jazzy selection of Christmas songs!
You cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here since Jeff first opened in 2000.  The sandwiches are GREAT!  They have a green chili mayo that can be requested and adds zest everything.  They also make their own buns which adds to the freshness experience."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint me. EVER! Just went there the other day with friends for lunch. Definitely a \"whole in the wall\"-ish location. But the food is amazing and the staff is friendly. Prickly pear chicken is the best! Thanks, as always, for food worth going out to eat for. Flancer's = Yummy"}
{"text":"I hate to jump off of the it's-a-family-run-business-so-I'm-going-to-cut-it-some-slack bandwagon, but I wasn't super impressed with Flancer's. I didn't think my sandwich was terrible, but it definitely wasn't anything memorable--well, that's not true. It was memorable, but that's sort of the problem. Ok, I'm even confusing myself. Let me elaborate. 

I had read great things about the Prickly Pear sandwich from Yelp, so when I found myself in Gilbert (which I do about three times a month for work) and didn't want fast food, I decided to stop by Flancer's and put in an order. My sandwich plus drink and tip came to around $9. The guy who took my order was really welcoming. I stood back, read the local Gilbert newspaper (apparently, it's a really happening place!), and waited approximately 10-15 minutes for my sandwich to be done. 

When I went outside to eat my sandwich and unwrapped the foil, I had I came upon a sight that was terrifying, to say the least. My chicken was BRIGHT pink. Oy vey--salmonella city! It took me a good 30 seconds to realize that the prickly pear sauce had turned the chicken a nice rosy shade. Now that my appetite was already a bit soured, I bit into the sandwich. The flavor of the chicken was a bit sugary for my taste, and the green chile mayo didn't have much of a kick. The bread was really crusty and delicious, but overall, I think the sandwich was more hype than substance. 

I may be back if I'm in Gilbert and again, find myself not willing to settle for fast food, but I'll probably try a different sandwich!"}
{"text":"Yumm! I've never been here before but a sanddwich sounded good. Great sandwich ... prickly pear chicken I think it was called, and the mac n cheese hit the spot! Thank you."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza. I got prosciutto, fresh garlic, basil with white sauce. Best I have experienced in the valley."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to try the prickly pear chicken sandwich and ended up coming back for dinner to try the philly and wild mushroom burger. First the prickly pear is most definitely a five star sandwich. The wild mushrooms on the burger are oysters and shiitake. Yummy. The philly was awesome as well and the bread is delicious. The salads were good and they make their own croutons. Lot, our server was way awesome and polite and offered sound advice. And the music is great, something appreciated by us generation Xers. 

Trying the green chile turkey sandwich with the awesome balsam salad this time. The salad with chicken, mushrooms and hot balsam was the superstar. The green chile mayo on the turkey was an amazing combo. A close second to the prickly pear."}
{"text":"No longer a believer in DDD.

I thought Guy Fieri was into good food. I used to look at the places his stomach would conquer in amazement and have even allowed my fat heart take trips out to some of those areas.

The fact that he has not stopped by Flancer's has burned a hole in whatever organ it is in our body that allows us to trust someones judgement.

I used to force people to drive from Scottsdale, Glendale, Goodyear, and Phoenix just to try Flancer's. They all became instant fans and the only complaint ever heard about the distance to get there was that our lunch break was not long enough to make it a lunch option.

Now that I am in Dallas, TX my wife and I find ourselves missing this place. The \"We must meat I aint lion\" sandwich is just so awesome.

Go to this place."}
{"text":"Kind of a dive but way good food. Go here for something off the beaten path. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out...I was not disappointed. Food was amazing! Happy hour is everyday from 3-6pm ."}
{"text":"First time visitor.  Nice setting, super friendly waitress.  Our table had the blt, philly steak and Italian hogie.  We all thought the bread [bun] made all of our sandwiches better.  I was expecting a much bigger cheesesteak for the price.  The blt was the spiciest blt my friend ever had.  It was the chipotle mayo.  The Italian hoagie was excellent.  We all decided this place was worth coming back to.  Thought all of the sandwiches were $1-2 overpriced for the size."}
{"text":"If I could give less I would... One of the dirtiest kitchens I have ever seen.. food greasy not house made.. the owner should be ashamed with his suposedly culinary background.. unlsess you want to get sick.. never ever eat there... I have seen behind the scenes and its alarming."}
{"text":"Great service, dive-y diner with exceptionally gourmet sandwiches and pizza. Their fries are golden and delicious. I love their cheesesteaks and homemade bread. Hot wings are uniquely spicy and meaty. Never had a bad experience here!!"}
{"text":"Whoa this place was such a delicious surprise! Living in central Phoenix we don't make it out this way much. However, today was my dads 74th birthday and he wanted to watch his grand kids get worn out at urban jungle up the street. We came here for lunch and it was so yummy! Will definitely be back! Fresh bread and the green chili mayo is an awesome addition to every great sandwich! Can't wait to come again and try the salad with warm goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes! Yum!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Overpriced. Definitely not worth the money. 11 bucks for an 8 inch \"philly\"?  It was NOTHING like a real philly."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for sandwiches and pizza (lunch and dinner), and we keep coming back. There is a nice variety of sandwiches with cool names and tasty ingredients -- their cheesesteak is good, even if it isn't something that the people from Philadelphia would consider authentic. The bread is fresh and so are the ingredients.

My kids love the pizza here, which doesn't hurt when we're deciding where to go. Because they have other good things on the menu, even if I don't feel like pizza, they can get what they want. And, if I want pizza, I think it is pretty good as well. 

I enjoy the salads. The spinach salad with spicy pecans is probably my favorite, but there is another one with a fried \"wheel\" of goat cheese on top that is nice as well. 

This latest visit -- I think this is the 35th time I've checked in here on Yelp -- was for their new breakfast offering. Currently, only offered on weekends, they have a good selection of options that is not overly extensive, but covers most of the bases. Since this was my first time, I ordered the first thing on the menu: a smothered breakfast burrito. Mine was 3 scrambled eggs with chorizo and cheese, smothered in a spicy green chili sauce and served with hash brown potatoes. I enjoyed it a lot. Note that they warn you on the menu that their green chili sauce tends towards spicy. They are not kidding and I suggest getting it on the side if you are worried. It is not just spicy, though, it has a nice flavor. 

They brew coffee from local roaster Piexoto. I had heard of them but have not yet made it into their shop to get coffee. The coffee had a good flavor and they've moved up on my list of local coffee shops to visit once I can get over to their Chandler location. 

Since I have only tried the burrito, and I don't know that the biscuit my wife had was quite as good as the homemade tortilla that was wrapped around my eggs and chorizo, I can't speak to the overall breakfast offering, but I would go back for the green chili sauce alone. And the coffee.

I would be remiss if I did not mention the staff. They have been consistently friendly and helpful during our many visits. It was the \"breakfast grand opening\" this time, and the owner even stopped by our table to make sure everything was to our liking."}
{"text":"Wow. Just WOW! I was totally impressed, I usually pass up places like this but I'm in a new area and have 30 minutes for lunch. What an idiot i am! Definitely never judge a book by its cover. The atmosphere is fun and was busy for lunch ( which is always a good sign) with diners eating in. The menu was AWESOME, I had the \"Goat to have it\" salad. Hands down, the best gorgonzola dressing, fresh goat cheese and salad Ive ever had and im from SanDiego, I eat A LOT of salad! The GM even came by my table to offer me something to drink since I originally ordered to go and wanted to eat and run. I was shocked, most people don't care or offer that type of service anymore. He also new I wasn't a regular and offered 15% off my next visit, SCORE! Best customer service I've had in a VERY. LONG. TIME. I will DEFINITELY BE back with the gang and will be my regular lunch joint from now on!! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The folks at Flancer's continue to amaze us with their great food and friendly home town service. Still one of the best eateries in downtown Gilbert, even in light of the number of new restaurants in the area. Their sandwiches and salads are great, and their dinner entrees are really tasty as well. Can't say enough good things about the place."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Have tried takeout from this place twice now. First time they screwed up my order. Manager was very apologetic and pleaded with us to give them another chance. We did and they screwed up the order again. The exact same way. The girl taking the orders and ringing up the takeout orders needs to spend a little less time trying to make sure she is showing off all of her chest tattoos and focus a little more on getting the orders right. Two strikes is enough for me. My recommendation is to avoid this place and spend your money somewhere that they take the time to get your order right."}
{"text":"I lllooovveee Flancers!  They have \"real\" salads with funky lettuces while still serving sandwiches that leave my husband happy.  My teenage son declared this his new fave restaurant after enjoying the cheesy garlic bread and parmesan chicken.  I am SO happy that that have good kids meals for $5 that DO NOT include french fries but are served with mandarin oranges, carrots & celery."}
{"text":"I ordered the large Awesome Balsam balsamic salad, and it was fabulous.  Spring salad mix with marinated mushrooms, roasted red peppers and balsamic chicken.  It came with a unique balsamic dressing, and made quite the impression.  Two words... LOVE IT!

My wife ordered the Ace of Clubs, which is a club sandwich with avocado.  It comes a green chile mayonnaise, and there was very little green chile flavor.  She wouldn't order it again, but would definitely go back to try a different sandwich.

We tried the apple blueberry cobbler, and were kind of surprised when we saw it come with a classic oatmeal crumble top.  We prefer a crust topping.

Every entree that we noticed servers walking by with, looked delicious.  The wait staff was very friendly, and so was the manager, who was making the rounds, checking on customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Lost its consistency lately. The tres leches is always awesome but lately it's getting smaller and the location in N Mesa makes it much better. With enough milk.

The phylo appetizers are also much better in the north Mesa location. The Gilbert one really skimps on the amount of filling.

Both locations make the best bLT. Make sure to get the spicy mayo and potato cake!

Warning: The pasta dishes are all quite bad. Have been for years. They are def not known for the pastas."}
{"text":"The food is worth a 4/5 star most def.

The server we had at the Mesa location was not super friendly unfortunately but tenfold was great.

The tres leches and cobbler are amazing desserts"}
{"text":"Great upscale sandwiches at moderate prices. I had the pastrami, wife had a chicken/mushroom concoction. 

The contents were special. Lean but full of flavor pastrami with just the right appointments, ditto my wife's sandwich. we both marveled at the bread which we confirmed is made there. Not so thick that you have to unlock your jaw to get your mouth around it, memorable flavor.

Jalapeno/cheese/mashed potato was great, as was the cole slaw (when was the last time that someone paid attention to cole slaw?).

Warm and inviting atmosphere, highly attentive service from all.

Highly recommended, and well worth the 40 minute drive to get there."}
{"text":"Bruschetta was amazing. No bones about it chicken sandwich was one of the greatest spicy chicken sandwiches I've eaten. Great food."}
{"text":"I guess it serves me right for ordering a burger at a sandwich place.  I ordered some southwestern-style burger and the meat was so dry and boring, it had me craving a nasty Five Guys burger.  I was really disappointed in this place.  Besides the ungodly wait (despite tables being open), the appetizer cheese triangle things were pretty good and the service was excellent.  I might give this place another chance when I feel like having a sandwich.  I would not recommend this place for a burger though."}
{"text":"Soon after moving to Gilbert I tried this place after hearing & reading all the rave feedback.  I remember being disappointed as it didn't live up to the hype in my opinion.  That was several years ago.  This week a friend suggested we meet there for lunch.  I'm always open to giving a place a 2nd try.  In fact I was looking forward to enjoying a great lunch.  We met before the noon lunch frenzy and didn't wait long for a booth, which we requested. That was nice.  Getting to the point, my dissatisfaction was with the service and cost.  We ordered a lunch appetizer which took approx 20 mins to arrive.  Server stopped at table to ask how appetizer was before I even had a chance to try it.  That was the first we saw our server after taking order.  Within 5 mins of receiving delayed appetizer our entrees were served.  Again, our server disappeared until time for check when she asked if we wanted desert.  Our lunch consisted of a shared appetizer and the 1/2 sandwich/salad combo each.  Friend had iced tea and I had water.  Our tab was $33.  My opinion is this place is priced in a restaurant category out of its league.  Food was good but nothing special and over priced.  Service was arrogant and lacking quality.   Seating is crowded and limited and parking terrible.  Given the choice I would dine at Liberty Market for better service, food, price and overall experience."}
{"text":"As always, best food, service friendly staff. Love Flanders and their creative food. The interior could use a facelift but other than that, 100% every time."}
{"text":"This place is great! 

It's a cozy little hometown restaurant that has fantastic and friendly service along with delicious food.

My husband and I went after having read about it here on yelp, and it really was a great spot to grab a bit to eat. I tried one of their burgers and it was delicious. It tasted home-grilled and not processed. My husband had the pear sandwich that everyone talks about and he really enjoyed it. 

The service was also incredibly welcoming and friendly. I highly recommend our waiter, Tanner, as he had great suggestions for the food as well as some great conversation.

I advise everyone to check it out. I can't wait to go back, especially considering it is easy on the wallet!"}
{"text":"Three words describe this place... YUM YUM YUM!!!  When this place first opened on the corner near my house, I did not know if I wanted to try it or not.  But am I glad I did!

Try the Chili Verde Birdie Turkey sandwich.  Fresh moist roasted turkey, on a baguette, green chili mayo, provolone and lettuce and tomato.  Really good!  Another sandwich I like is the Hoagie and Bacall Italian sandwich.  Also served on a fresh baguette, it has 3 different types of meat, banana peppers, cheese and lettuce, tomato and onions.  Very good!  Have to have these with their french fries.  They have to be the best I have ever tasted!

The inside of the place is small, but oh so comfortable.  They use posters from rock concerts of the mid to late 1960's as decor.  Nice.  Everyone that works there is super friendly.  Prices are pretty good too for the amount of food you get.

One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Got a sandwich and soup, food was good. Had the French onion soup and the pastrami sandwich. Only complaint is I wish there was more meat on the sandwich to make it more filling."}
{"text":"It takes a lot to get 5 stars! Our waitress was amazing and friendly. The food was more amazing! Ordered the chipotle noodles (can't remember exact name) they are very spicy. Also got chicken sandwich, the bread is so delicious- even as left overs!! They are a little pricey but the bread may be worth it."}
{"text":"Great way to kick off a spa day with a girlfriend. 

Things to brag about: homemade bread, fast service, unique flavors for sandwiches ( I got the prickly pear chicken), easy and comfortable atmosphere, to the point staff. 

Will try their homemade fruit cobbler next time."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now; once to-go and one sit down.  Both times the food was great and the service was so spot on I don't think I would order to-go again. Fast, fresh and friendly will get my business every time!!"}
{"text":"Took my 1.5 year old son here on a Friday morning for a breakfast date around 9am. I was a little worried that we were the only ones there, but it sounds like they just recently added breakfast to the menu. We shared the smothered philly meat breakfast burrito with green chile sauce that came with a side of hash browns. The tortilla was fresh and the green chile sauce was amazing - do you guys sell that?

Taking the time to write the review however because our waitress was fantastic. She either has had kids herself or is an aunt, because she knew exactly what we needed to have a pleasant breakfast. First thing she did after taking our order was ask if my son could have some Goldfish while we waited. Umm, yes please. Then after she brought our food out she asked, \"Can I get him a side of mandarin oranges?\" Perfect. My son devoured both things graciously brought over and also enjoyed the burrito and hash browns.

For that kind of forward-thinking service, and to try the lunch options that my neighbor raves about, we will be back."}
{"text":"I live in N. Phx (101 & Cave Creek) but most of my friends are in the East Valley, got turned onto the original location over a decade ago (We Must Meat I ain't Lion) and was a goner. While kid sitting, hit the Higley location Tuesday.  As always food was impeccable, service was friendly and fast (converted two more people to the Flancer's cult that night). Our server got extra stars for pulling out the booth table and digging out a piece of a toy the kid dropped in there (I would have left it behind).   I have dined and drank my way from Cave Creek to Avondale to AJ and all areas in between and Flancers is pretty much my favorite AZ restaurant.  I would sell a kidney to have a location anywhere within a 10-15 mile radius of me."}
{"text":"If you are gonna call a burger \"guac and roll\" have guac on it. We are in arizona, very disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here for linner today as I had a groupon (yay for using up my groupons!). The BF and I got there around 3 oclock so the place wasn't so busy, there were still a few tables in there, though. They have some interesting things on their menu, but I decided to be kind of safe and got the 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad combo with the thyme chicken and goat cheese salad. They were both good, but the sandwich was better than the salad. The salad looks like they always use the same base salad and then just throw the extras that make it a 'specialty' salad on top. That was alright though. I thought the fried goat cheese was good, the balsamic that I got with it was weirdly thick, but tasted good. The chicken on the sandwich was tasty. The thing that got me was they make this huge deal out of their making their own bread, but it's not anything special. It kind of tastes like nothing.... weird. The BF got the still crazy after all these years sandwich, which is fried mozzarella and veggie (which was what I wanted! but the BF is pickier than me so I let him have it). This was pretty good too.... I mean, what isn't when it's fried? He said the sandwich would have been better had it had fried tomatoes and melted cheese instead of fried cheese.... I thought it tasted good. He got fries as his side (even though I urged him to get the mashed potato pie thing.... *sigh) and they were good, they tasted kind of beer battered. Although this place was good, I wouldn't wait in line to eat here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Flancer's for dinner out the other night and had a great experience.  The food was fresh and tasted great.  We had a pizza and brochette.  I have been to the Gilbert location for lunch before and the sandwiches were awesome.  Good food and friendly staff.  We will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Over priced. You pay too much for what you recieve. I ordered the Italian sandwich and it was wayyy too salty. My boyfriend had a turkey sandwich and that wasn't bad but we've had better. We ordered a mozzarella appetizer and you barely get too triangle for 5 bucks! Plus half the cheese melted away in the deep fryer any ways. We won't be returning. If your looking for an awesome sandwich try Ike's in mesa!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and had a delightful meal each time.  They were so busy that it required a 15 min wait on table and they do turn the table quite expediently.  Pizza, and pasta dishes were cooked to perfection and their drink selection compliment their meals perfectly.  If you like great Italian food, this is a great choice in heart of Mesa."}
{"text":"Back again, and everything was even better than the first time.  It seems the trick is to come early for lunch.  Everything's fresh and tasty, and the service is fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"First time we went there, we were told it was a 20 minute wait.  After 30 minutes, the hostess said there were still 3 people in front of us.  We had to leave because of an appointment.  Frustrating to see all of the empty tables.

Gave it another try and loved it.  Very friendly waiter and delicious food.  

I had a turkey sandwich and the bread was delicious.  Husband loved his Philly Cheesesteak.  Must come back and try other items."}
{"text":"My husband visiited this place yesterday for lunch even though I told him of my poor experience.  He came back with an even worse story than mine! EEWWWW!  Lets just say that he'd be doing a service to the good people of Gilbert if he called the health inspector.  GORDON RAMSAY WHERE ARE YOU? I know lets send Man Vs. Food into this place, on second thought, no one derserves this type of punisment!"}
{"text":"I'm SOOOO glad I found this gem of a restaurant in the neighborhood where I work. It is truly amazing! I find myself craving the Chile Verde Birdie sandwich (fresh shaved turkey breast, bacon, avocado, green chile mayo on homemade bread), with a side of the most amazing french fries I've ever had. It's a small cafe so I often get my sandwich to go, but when I do eat in, the staff is always very friendly and fast. They also have daily specials which sound very interesting, but I can never seem to stray from my favorite sandwich. My friend says the burgers are the bomb!"}
{"text":"If you are visiting Gilbert Az.... be sure to visit Flancers... amazing flavors... fresh ingredients!!!
You will not be disappointed... prickly pear and green chili aoli. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The waitress says, \"The special of the day is the Eggplant Sandwich, although I am allergic to eggplant, the eggplant is really good.\"  

 Hmm... _  and  (_)

My reply:  \"What happens when you eat eggplant?\"  Waitress:  \"I am allergic to eggplant.\" 


Went to lunch with buddy Ordered a spinach salad, dressing on the side.   The dressing came on the salad, suprise.  The French onion soup is extremely salty - - - overbearingly salty.  When the waitstaff was made aware of this, their only comment, \"Oh, I know, I agree completely!\".  Huh?  What planet are you guys on?  If you knew, why did you serve it, or at least inform me?  Or even better yet, fix it, or God forbid offer up a solution?  I would have like to  have been offered something else, even though I'd have declined.  It would have been polite.  But no.  I left a 22% tip (paid cash) because there was no one at the register. Lunch: spinach salad, salty soup, veggie sandwich, 2 iced teas, $36 with tip.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The service here has been great! The menu is both original and distinct. Meals are a bit more than you would pay other places, but Flancer's uses quality ingredients that you can taste. Totally worth it. We were greeted by the manager Eric who was in the kitchen helping the wait staff, and had ideas to help make our meal that much better. Love this place."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Flancers. It was highly recommended by an employee.  We both ordered the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich.  The sandwich was made with fresh baked bread that was made right here in the restaurant.  It was absolutely delicious.  One of the best Philly Cheese sandwiches that I have had in years. The French fries were the coated type and very good.  We will definitely we returning!!"}
{"text":"Flancer's is one of the best places for sandwiches in the valley!

Although everything is always excellent, I have a hard time ordering something other than the prickly pear chicken sandwich. My mouth waters at the thought of its sweet chicken goodness, smothered with a perfect amount of green chile mayonnaise, all on a freshly baked baguette. Delicious!

Other menu items are almost as good. The Chile Birdie Verde and We Must Meat, I Ain't Lion and are also favorites. As far as sides go, definitely get the Jalapeno & Cheddar Mashed Potato Pie. It can be a bit on the spicy side, but it's fantastic. 

Flancer's also hosts beer dinners fairly regularly. The chef really takes the menu to a higher level during these evenings. Additionally, on holidays they have pre-prepared meals you can pick up for a special evening. We did this last Valentine's Day and really enjoyed the experience. It was a bit more hands-on than I expected, but everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm always nervous going to new different locations of the same restaurants. I like to see the same waiters and know the same layout. This flancers was a lot different as far as style than the Gilbert location. But I had a really cool waitress and the prickly pear sandwich was unreal. Never can go wrong with flancers. Ever. 

I even met a famous football player there. So if lineman for the cardinals are eating there. You know it's a really good place."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a sandwich and a beer.  Location had been recommended to us by two separate individuals.  We were not disappointed at all.  I had the philly cheese steak sandwich.  The steak melted in my mouth, the peppers on it were crunchy and not soft. My side dish was the hatch pepper mac and cheese.  It was creamy and the right amount of hatch peppers topped it off perfectly. Just the right amount of heat and flavor.  Craft beer was on tap from local breweries.  We spent a long time talking with Tim the General Manager regarding the business.  Everything is made inside the restaurant, fresh on a daily basis and that includes the breads, dressings, etc. The restaurant is also involved philanthropically with non profits in the neighborhood as well as reaching out to other restaurants for participation in their fund raising events. I like a local business that gives back to the community where I live.  Go grab a sandwich and a beer.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So so good! Hubby and I got the cheese steak sandwiches and they were delicious! Exactly what we were craving. There was a ton of meat and it was flavorful and very tender. No chunks of fat or gristle at all. The bread held up nicely and was soft. French fries were crispy and perfect. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very soggy pizza, my sub same very soggy. They need to cook their bread products more. Boneless wings taste like the came from a TV dinner and out of a microwave. Service was slow, drinks were empty before an offer for refill.

Not coming back."}
{"text":"Flancer's is awesome. Their bread is fresh baked daily. The Philly cheese steak and We must meat I ain't lion are amazing! I have heard great things about the prickly pear chicken sandwich too. The only drawback is the the place is a little small."}
{"text":"Ordered the goat cheese bruschetta, prickly pear chicken and Italian sandwich.

Goat cheese bruschetta was really good.  I'd go back for that alone.

Prickly pear chicken was ok.  Because of the marinade they use the meat comes out pink looking and most closely resembles ham in appearance rather than chicken.  Kind of weird honestly.

The Italian sandwich was meh.   The meat was average at best and that's being generous (just slightly north of Subway quality).  Quite frankly this is really a shame because the rest of the sandwich (bread, veggies, vinaigrette) were very good.

Overall pretty good.  Not a 4, probably closer to a 3.5, but I'm giving a 3 because of the sandwiches.

Almost forgot to add...with two drinks (soda/tea) and tip this all came to $42.  Just a tad pricey...not sure the value was there."}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed with this place, but I wasn't really disappointed either.  When we first walked in, I was really confused with the layout, and we actually stood in the middle of the doorway for like 10 minutes before they bothered to seat us.  I was mostly confused because I saw like 3 empty tables.  Once we sat down, our drinks were promptly brought out to us and continually refilled.  I always appreciate that.  We ordered the mozz triangles to start because we were famished and then I got the bacon and gorgonzola burger.  The mozz triangles were really yummy with gooey cheese on the inside and surprisingly crispy outsides.  The fries with my burger were really quite good and seasoned well.  The burger is where things fell a little flat.  The meat tasted completely unseasoned and was very well done.  I much prefer medium, but there are certainly places where a well done burger can still be tasty and juicy.  This really wasn't one of them.  The burger as a whole wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  I guess I don't really understand all the love this place gets when it really just seems okay to me."}
{"text":"Delicious! First time trying the pizza here & it's awesome! Jalapeño, pepperoni, & hatch chili's :)
In the past I've had the open face turkey green chili sandwich & it's unreal! This place has good bread, desert, food, & service! 4th time here love it ;)"}
