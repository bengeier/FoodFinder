{"text":"The restaurant is clean, quiet, small and has a more serene feeling to it than regular Chinese restaurants, but the food is just as good. The selection and variety is not as big... but its good enough quality. I ordered mostly off the Dim Sum Menu and everything was fresh, flavourful and seemingly home-made. The Steamed Beef Sui-Mai was of the typical restaurant texture, but without all the usual MSG! (good sign). Plate portions are not as large, however the prices are still somewhat reasonable. What it lacks in size makes up in the overall service and food quality. The staff  here is also friendly, attentive and really makes sure that the customers are well taken care of. The servers are quick to greet, take drinks orders, provide extra napkins, take away dishes and etc. It's a great team here. The only improvements they need to work on are possible expansion of the restaurant itself since it gets very busy on weekends at noon where some people may not even get a spot and it's sad because I've seen others walk away when the place is too busy or a full house"}
{"text":"I suppose you can't expect much from an \"all day dim sum\" place, especially one tucked away in the Yonge-Finch area. But this place looked cute and small, and the appeal of dim sum for dinner was nice!   This was the 2nd time coming here, but both experiences were pretty similar. We were the only people there except for another group, and there was only one female server (who much preferred to text on her phone most of the time).    Anyway, the selection at least, is wide and like your typical dim sum menu. We ordered:   1) Seafood congee  - Eugh. This was so bland. It was not seafood-y at all, but just regular congee with 4-5 pieces of frozen bagged seafood dumped in. Everything was so rubbery and unflavoured.   2) Steamed shrimp and vegetable dumplings  - This was the one tasty dish we ordered. But, I really dislike the rice-based wrapper and much prefer the wheat-based kind. It would be hard to really mess this up, anyway.   3) Deep-fried shrimp dumplings  - Wow, this was pretty gross. It came out overcooked, way too crunchy, and with scary-looking oil pockets on top that gave me the chills to look at.   4) Steamed tripe  - Boring, bland, rubbery, etc.   Even if I have a dim sum craving at night again, would NOT come back here for it."}
{"text":"I really must update this restaurant - I came here with friends a different time and this time we went with some other dishes (more experimentation vs known dishes) and some dishes really weren't all that great.  We had the hot & spicy spare ribs, honey garlic chicken wings, general tao chicken, and cashew chicken.  The only dish that I enjoyed was the cashew chicken, the rest were simply not that good!  This is in direct contrast with the amazing Singapore noodles, Kung Pow chicken, Pad Thai and other various Szechuan dishes I absolutely loved last time.  I guess there simply are dishes that are great and other that I'd never put above the \"I'm never ordering that again\" category."}
{"text":"This place should be called, \"Just Not Dim Sum.\" The slogan should be, \"What is it?\" And the answer would be, \"There's no way this is food.\" Terrible. Check it out if you want to find hilarity and disappointment in every bite. Truly, the only place that has made disappointment and hilarity actual flavours. Service team was as well put together as their sludgy turnip cake. Prepare to be taken aback. Your jaw will drop. Your eyes will roll to the back of your head. You will lose your breath."}
{"text":"Good dim sum place, clean but small.  They didn't have some of the things on the menu, but overall pretty tasty and good selection. Liked the noodles and beef dish (not from the dim sum menu). I'd skip the pud thai though, and stick to the chinese dishes.  Get the custard buns for dessert."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because it's close by and convenient however unfortunately I did not, I got take out so maybe dinning in is better.   I got stir fry noodles and pan fried onion cake, the noodles were super oily and didn't have much taste and the pan fried onion cake was burnt.   Only real plus I can say is that it is one of the only Chinese food establishments in the area and the menu options are vast."}
{"text":"Definitely a favourite for lunch on Fridays!  This place can fill up fast at lunch but since the service is usually quick, we're typically in and out within the hour.  There are soooo many dishes to choose from and they have really great lunch specials.  The Cantonese Chow Main is a good bet for a 'well rounded' dish but I swear, one of these days I'm going to eat a whole plate of Honey Crystal Chicken all to myself!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE going here, however today went to have lunch at the restaurant with coworkers and noticed that there was a bird flying over everyone while they were eating. UNHEALTHY! I am a strict vegan for RELIGIOUS reasons, not by choice but due to a religious ceremony which requires that I abstain from all meat of byproducts, seafood etc.! I told the waitress \"NO ONIONS, NO EGGS, NO CHICKEN, NO BEEF, NO SEAFOOD, and NO GREEN PEPPERS (the green peppers was a choice).\" The first time the Singapore noodles was made it had shrimp in it, so I sent it back, the second time it had onions, so I sent it back, the third time (after waiting for 1 hour (it appeared to look like it was what I had asked for, as I took my third bite, I noticed something that appeared to look like eggs, so I had someone try it. It was confirmed that it was indeed eggs in my meal. I told the waitress that I was not paying for the meals and she called the manager over. He was not apologetic but instead said that he did not want to see my face ever again in the restaurant. My coworker who ordered the bok-choy and beef receiver her order with chunks of what appeared to be lard or fat all over the beef, she sent it back to the kitchen and it came back just the same way she sent it. She complained to the manager as well and was told the same thing. These people have absolutely NO customer service! AND to top if off, seeing that I am a vegan and they have just made something that I should have not eaten, you would think they would be more sympathetic. This is definitely the last time I will be eating at this place. Not only have I reported them to the Better Business Bureau of Canada, but the City of Toronto and Health Canada."}
{"text":"This is a small, tucked away Chinese restaurant just off the intersection of Finch & Yonge. Busiest times are during the week, lunch time. Weekends are slower.   We went on a Sunday for an early dinner & there was a family of five there. Then several people who came & went that ordered take out. NJDM also delivers for people who would rather eat at home.   We got some dim sum orders: shrimp roll, veggie dumpling,  veggie spring rolls, chicken spring rolls, pork with black bean sauce, crispy chicken & chicken Sho Mai along with some veggie fried rice. We actually ordered too much! LOL. Anyway, we liked all the rolls, the crispy chicken & fried rice. Hubby had the pork in black bean sauce & the chicken sho mai. We thought it all tasted good except the veggie dumplings. Yuck! It was a gooey mess inside & tasted like bad cabbage.  Other than that service was fast & cheerful. Everything was hot & fresh from the kitchen. Nice place to eat in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A little bit off of the area where the restaurants are, Not Just Dim Sum was a bit hard to find. Like other reviewers have said, the place is small and very clean which makes you feel pretty good sitting in there.  They have small paper for you to order dimsum (2.75 for a small) and a menu for regular food.   We ordered: - shrimp dumpling (har gow): the skin was very thick, which is not generally the case for these type of dishes. It was not great but awful. - clear skin chive and shrimp dimpling: okay. no complaint here. - black bean spare ribs: extremely salty but very tasty - deep fried squid tentacles: it didn't taste all the fresh because the whole thing was just not al dente enough. it should be less chewy and more rubbery. flavour was okay - garlic baby bok choy: a \"Special\" dish that was over $5 with fairly small portion. it was done VERY well though. best dish probably - custard bun: way too much flour and the custard was not dense at all.  - singapore vermicelli: good, no complaints  Overall, the food was decent, not the greatest dimsum but it satiates the craving, any time of the day.   My only complaint is that they crossed off chicken feet on the menu. I believe it's permanently not there, which makes me sad because for me it's a staple dimsum dish!  The total for all the above was about $31 after tax. Not too bad. Service was very good. The girl who was the only waitress there was super nice and helpful and polite."}
