{"text":"Best Chinese Food from Laval to St-Jérôme.  I have been going with my grandsons since they opened and I love. Actually that's where we are going tonight."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Over priced. I had takeout but noticed the dining room had leaks from the ceiling in 3 different places."}
{"text":"The crispy duck was excellent. Nearly half a duck for the price too!

Good size servings for the price, quick. They made an excellent attempt to provide service in French.  Will definitely return here again."}
{"text":"Pros :

- The spring rolls were well presented, very tasty and accompanied with an awesome homemade sweet sauce.

- The Hunan peanut butter dumplings are different from what I'm used to but are actually very good as well with a homemade peanut butter sauce that made me almost lick the plate clean. :)

- The garlic spareribs are incredibly good! They are bigger than the norm, so more delightful meat to chew on with a succulent sweet sauce that I enjoy pouring with a spoon on top of my rice.

- Speaking of rice, the rice balls are huge! Very good.

- Ken Ching is a beautiful resto, aesthetically pleasing and clean. The design and wall painting are a nice touch.

- The service all night long was quick and efficient.

- The garlic noodles were very good, the plate was HUGE! Most plates easily accommodate 3-4 people.

- The price-tag is decent.


Cons :

- While the General Tao was above average I can't help but feel disappointment by it. This dish should be killer, the thing that keeps customers coming back.... what I got was something that lacked that flavor or OOMPH to take it to the next level.

- We were seated where an air vent was situated right over our heads. We were told to change seats but not table when there were plenty of other tables to spare. So we ate with our jackets on. 

All in all, a good resto, will be back again with a group to \"test out\" more plates. :)"}
{"text":"After sampling a couple of their plates, I immediately started to feel an alien-like presence in my stomach. It's now 5 hours later and I'm laying in bed praying for a quick death for the suffering to end. I wouldn't say it's food poisoning judging from the symptoms, but there's definitely something in there that disagreed with my system (msg, poor quality meat, fat, weird sauce...??). 
Let this review serve as my obituary if I don't make it through the night....

Needless to say I will not be retuning there."}
{"text":"Great service. The won ton soup was amazing, the best broth I've had in a long time. The prices are very decent. Fun to know there is a good Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best chinese food i had in laval - food was fresh and tasty

Spare ribs were awesome and not like eating a piece of dry wood like most places

Chicken chop suey was good beef and brocoli also good and had actual beef in it :) 

Chicken spring rolls were awesome

Friendly delivery guy

Finally found my chinese resto in laval"}
{"text":"Quiet evening at this nicely appointed restaurant. The salt and pepper chicken, orange chicken, and pork fried rice were all fabulous. The entire family was pleased with the food and the service."}
{"text":"I was not sure if I should give it a 4 star or a 3 star. If I was rating it for Laval it would be a 5 star as there is nothing else decent when it comes to chinese food. But in the real world of chinese food its really a 2 star. So I gave it a 3 star as it's just OK. 
If you do not want to go into the city I would recommend this place as the food is ok. Your typical General Tao(No such dish in china), fried noodles etc... very canadianized food. For those who really want good chinese food go to Toronto or china. Montreal......forget it!! Like everything else Montreal gets screwed."}
