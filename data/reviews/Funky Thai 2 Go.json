{"text":"We didn't like anything we ordered. We tend to order the standards: pad thai, cold rolls, etc. But everything tasted like ketchup or bbq sauce. It was quick and convenient, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Excellent food at fair prices.  I have been going here for years.  I have had Thai food in many places, but the make the best Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Go to Salad Thai instead. Way better food. Only plus here is that they deliver and the spring rolls were edible."}
{"text":"Great Thai delivery place. The food is always good and they deliver it hot and on time. The satay pad thai and basil chicken are favorites of mine."}
{"text":"Small space. It's good for take-out. The service is really friendly. The food it's tasty and fresh. Will come again."}
{"text":"Delicious food & fast delivery - and super friendly service! This is the 2nd time we've ordered from Funky Thai 2 Go...ordered Mini Shrimp Rolls, Chicken Fried Rice & Spicy Basil Chicken.  Only thing is we wished portions were bigger (but it was still plenty, just no leftovers); and wished complimentary side of stemmed rice came with regular entr√©e dish(es).  I really like their new menu...and I ordered using their new online system - super easy! (However, wished I could have used my credit card online.)  Definitely will order from Funky Thai 2 Go again!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm. Hate giving a 2 star to any place. I came here for lunch. Compared to what is in the area, the food was really bad. Probably, the worst Thai food I ever had   Sorry, but I hope you guys improve!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad! I ordered from this place last Friday. The guy who took my order seemed sort of confused...I said my address and the crossroads about four times, but he didn't seem to understand. I think he googled it, because he finally got the address right on the fifth try. He seemed disoriented when I asked about the pho soup. Got the impression that he was new, so I'll let that one slide.  Food was above average, similar to places like Thai Express, and was very affordable (27.95$ for pho soup, chicken pad thai and two cans of coke, plus delivery charge and tip). The portions were huge! I only managed to finish my pad thai because I didn't have any lunch. The pad thai was flavorful and seasoned just right, with a hint of lemon and lime. The pho soup was delicious: staff were very accommodating for my vegetarian girlfriend, who had a veggie-broth pho soup with veggies on the side. The broth was in fact a vegetable broth: not chicken or beef. It was just spicy enough to be enjoyable.   I was a bit disappointed that they didn't take debit for deliveries. Most people don't have cash on them, and I was one of them. They do take credit, but I don't have a usable credit card.  Overall, I would definitely order again, despite the difficulty in ordering and the debit card issue."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I ordered the chicken pad Thai lunch special, The whole thing was literally drowning in a sauce that I'm certain came out of a giant tub. Not authentic tasting at all. Also, there were hollow spongy cubes I'm assuming were tofu throughout. Very weird, Ive had  Thai food in a food court that was ok but not the best and I was imagining this to be in that category and it didn't even come close to that. Just a bowl of slop."}
