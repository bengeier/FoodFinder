{"text":"Great breakfast/lunch spot. I enjoyed the homemade cream of mushroom soup and half a turkey Rueben, delish! Washed it all down with a skim chai latte."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Nothing like it in town. I've been for breakfast and lunch and even ordered a sandwich ring for my office (to rave reviews!) during the month I was in Pitt for work. First of all, the atmosphere is light and welcoming. And the staff is SO friendly! I feel like I'm in a small neighborhood shop. They seem to know almost every customer's name too. They even have a water bowl and container of dog treats outside by the door for dogs. I'm addicted to the egg breakfast wrap with spinach, tomatoes and cheese. And their coffee is so good. They use la prima beans which I love and have almond milk for lattes. I've tried almost all of their sandwiches but the Italian Club is my favorite. And the kickin chicken is excellent too. But my favorite thing is the Irish soda bread scone. Omg. You really can't beat this place for quality and service. Plus the price is beyond right. Almost afraid to write this review because I don't want people to find out about it, but they totally deserve the accolades!"}
{"text":"Coffee review only!   I am always on the lookout for a new coffee place downtown, and they had SCONES! one of my favorite breakfast indulgences.  Coffee is la Prima, which is fine, my  cappuccino milk was overcooked and there was too much of it. Scone is from a mix.  Still, very nice counter service, and a welcome addition to the food wasteland that is downtown.  Best coffee downtown is still colony cat cafe."}
{"text":"My work ordered from Cafe 808 for lunch today.  I got the hot Italian club sub and it was delicious.  My co-workers were also pleased with their meals.  The house-made sun-dried tomato vinaigrette was a very good addition.  Usually, when I order a sub from a restaurant I am disappointed, this exceeded expectations.  I look forward to trying some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cafe 808. I work in downtown Pittsburgh and most places are just fast food type with unhealthy options. I love the fresh salads and sandwiches that don't make you feel bad after eating it.   I actually came in today because I'm pregnant I was actually craving french fries so I went somewhere else but I love the homemade ranch at Cafe 808 so I asked if I could buy some and they gave me some on the house since I didn't have cash, just my card. It sounds like a small thing but cravings are no joke and they were so nice about it."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I tried this place twice and were left disappointed both times, the second more significant than the first.  Our first experience on Monday was for coffee (specifically espresso) only to find their espresso machine wasn't operational. Given my tendency for bad luck, I laughed it off and wasn't going to hold it against them. I ordered a cold brew instead and found it acceptable. My coworker enjoyed her sandwich, so we decided to use Cafe 808 to order to go later in the week.  Fast forward to today (Wednesday), when we needed sandwiches in a narrow hour window. We placed the order at 10:19 AM online for an 11:30 delivery to our hotel three blocks down the road. 11:45 comes by and after a phone call, we hear the delivery person is out on someone else's delivery, and they were working on our order - not a good sign.  I decided to walk to Cafe 808 to pick it up myself (arrived at 11:56 after leaving at 11:52) only to see two staff members just starting to work on our order - a worse sign. The order was in my hand to leave at 12:13, which is unacceptable given the time we gave them.  I am not sure what took nearly two hours to make sandwiches, but I will not waste my time here again.  P.S. They gave us the wrong soup.  P.P.S. My coworkers encouraged me to write that at least the food was good."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch while visiting the city's Cultural District downtown and we loved this spot. It was exactly what we wanted: Delish sandwiches in a chill, friendly environment.   The menu is creative and we had a hard time deciding what to order. I ultimately went with the buffalo chicken hoagie (yum!!) and and my friend got an Italian club that was just as good. The hoagie rolls were soft, chewy and really fresh. They bumped the sandwiches to a whole other level.    The staff was friendly and made us feel like regulars, which is always a treat when you're a tourist. I guess this place just opened, so it's well worth checking out if you're in the area.     Overall, great food and energy! It recharged us for the rest of the day and I plan to stop again by before I leave town because I have to try their Nutella and banana breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, if I could give this place negative stars I would. There was a huge line, and only 2 workers. The cashier was clearly not a happy person, giving an attitude and kept rolling his eyes. I got the Turkey Bacon and Ranch wrap. I paid $7.48 for what I describe as a \"snack wrap\" very small and it was missing the Ranch! The wrap tasted ok, but not worth the $$"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim last week for brekkie.Go by every morning and had been anticipating the opening. First of all it's a very welcoming and inviting spot and they make good use of the space. I ordered two scones because I couldn't make up my mind. Cranberry Orange and Irish Soda. So fresh and delicious and reminded me of being back in the U.K. Of course I couldn't eat them both in one sitting so I split them in half and had leftovers for the next morning. I had black tea to go with my scones and it was so fresh. Also, it's house made so that's a plus. They serve lunch and I'm anxious to go back and try a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/lunch spot! Wish I wouldve taken a pic before scarfing down our food. I had an egg, cheese, and sausage roll and my cousin had the egg white and spinach roll. Coffee was great too!"}
