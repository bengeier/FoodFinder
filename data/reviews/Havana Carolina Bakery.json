{"text":"This is a small little place that packs big flavor Intuit just a wonderful dish. I had the roast pork plate the meat was tender juicy flavored in a way that only the Cubans can achieve this level of flavor. Hats off to them. This has become one of my new favorite places in town I will definitely be back multiple times. Not to mention I can take home loves of bread after all it's a bakery too!"}
{"text":"I accidentally found this location (I was lost) and I am so glad I did! I am Cuban born, raised in Miami and moved the Carolinas some years ago. I have really missed Cuban cuisine and have not found a \"real authentic\" cuban place yet. The owner here is Cuban born and also lived in Miami so he knows Cuban food. I had a Cuban sandwich and cafe con leche. It was amazing! Taking home some Cuban pastelitos and empanadas. They have good seating and I was able to enjoy my lunch while doing some work comfortably. I will sure be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Cuban food. Highly recommend for anyone to enjoy a piece of Havana. I have had several of their dishes and it all reminds me of home."}
{"text":"The food is really fresh and good and very authentic it reminds me of Miami or North Cuba LOL

As my beloved American friends would say

Easy access right off exit 58 highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great place to eat love the service and the food it fantastic. The bread is fresh baked and the rice and beans is my favorite to get."}
{"text":"The people here are very friendly and warm. We had ordered a few items to sample. We tried the Cuban, the tres leche cake, the chicken empanada, the guava pastry, the croquette, the cortadito, and the bread pudding. The Cuban was very good and so was the tres leche. The guava pastry could have used a bit more guava but it was good with our coffee. The croquette was pretty good but the chicken empanada was a bit over cooked and dry inside. The bread pudding was good but a bit more dense than what I'm used to. The coffee was delicious and their bread for their media noche was perfect! My friend had their beef empanada and said it was delicious. Overall a nice little family place to grab some Cuban food, coffee, and fresh bread."}
{"text":"We are always super excited to find Cuban food in places we don't expect. We found this place by accident and are so happy to have done so! We had the croquetas (my absolute fave), cream cheese pastry, plantains, and cafe cubano. Love love love!!!! Super cute place, very nice lady at the counter who waited on us. We will definitely visit again! :)"}
