{"text":"I went there with my roommate, on his recommendation. After reading several reviews expressing their displeasure with the awful service and the horrible wait times, I didn't set my bar too high; but my roommate liked it (it was his 3rd visit in as many days). 
At first glance: the restaurant is large, dimly lit, old and tired looking. But I was greeted, and offered a seat quickly.
To my complete surprise, I found the waitstaff to be rather quick and attentive.
The food was another matter.
I had the special; Pastitsio, with a tomato soup starter, followed by Caesar salad. The soup was fine....even good. The Caesar salad......very disappointing. I'm really not sure what a Greek restaurant is doing serving Caesar anyways, but that is beside the point. The salad was not any kind of a decent Caesar salad. It was served in a plastic bowl (pretty cheasie) ; iceberg lettuce (not romaine), store bought croutons (not a deal breaker), and not a hint of bacon.
This was quickly followed by the main course. My Pastitsio (pasta with ground beef and beachemel sauce)  was served with potato and rice.....3 starches....not a hint of vegetables. 
My roommate had chicken shawarmas ....also with potatoes and rice....no veg.
Both the pastitsio and the shawarmas where ok, however, I could definitely have lived without 3 starches and taken some sort of vegetable as a side. A few carrots aren't any more expensive or difficult to prepare. 
To conclude:
The service was surprisingly adept and quick. The ambiance was sadly deficient, and the food was passable at best.
Price....inexpensive to moderate.
Won't be back. There are many other restaurants to pick up the slack in that area of Montreal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal, the ambiance is very cozy, the service is very good, it always has space for large groups, the food is yummy, and the price is reasonable! Also, it's byow! This combination is rare to find!"}
{"text":"Il y a plusieurs bons restaurants grecs à Montréal. Celui-là fait partie de ceux que je trouve très agréables. De fait, je trippe fort sur leur combo filet mignon et trois crevettes papillons géantes (ça doit faire au moins cinq visites d'affilée que je commande ça). 

La terrasse est sympathique, le service est courtois, je dirais même très courtois : lors de ma dernière visite, avec un groupe d'amis pour l'anniversaire de deux d'entre elles, le serveur s'est permis de nous raconter une savoureuse anecdote qui lui était arrivée au bar de danseuses Les Amazones il y a bien longtemps (faut dire qu'on déconnait un peu en groupe et son intervention se prêtait très bien à notre délire plus ludique que vulgaire, je vous en fais le serment ;) ). 

Bref, un bel endroit pour s'amuser en groupe, mais aussi pour des soupers en tête à tête ou avec des amis. Et si vous m'y voyez avec un groupe, je vous suggère de vous joindre à nous, vous risquez seulement de passer une très drôle de soirée ! :)"}
{"text":"I chose this place for my birthday in February after having been just once in summer. There is tons of room for groups and you don't have to reserve much time in advance. 

I knew the food was good, and it was BYOW (and next to an SAQ!).Generally speaking, I feel this is a laid-back place where you can eat decent meat (not sure for vegetarians!) 

All in all, I think most of our table was happy with their orders, although apparently the onion soup was horrible. The proteins were well cooked to order (I had Filet Mignon) and most dishes come with salad and soup, which is nice. 

The staff was very friendly and attentive. Also, their terrasse in summer is amazing at the back of the restau, lots of flowers and somewhat hidden from the hustle of Duluth."}
{"text":"Great resto for byow. The shrimp plate or the surf & turf are amazing. But the last time we went, something changed.. the soup used to be much better, but it lacked tastiness, kinda tasted like canned soup(both the lentil & chicken soup). Great for groups, nice ambiance, good price too."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband while in town on our \"mini-moon\".  This was our last night in town and what a way to go out on a bang.  George was our server and he was fantastic- super personable and offered a ton of recommendations to make sure we tried all the right things.  This place is also very reasonably priced.  We left with a huge bag of leftovers and the bill was half of what we had been spending in Old Montreal.  I'm from Chicago, my husband is from Detroit both of which have great \"Greek Towns\" but this was honestly the best Greek food I've ever had.  George- you rocked our world!!"}
{"text":"You will not leave hungry! The setting is very nice and not only do they bring you a big basket of bread to start off, an entree comes with soup, salad, rice and potato (with food) as well as coffee and a dessert. The food was good and was not pricey for what you received. Great service as well, very friendly. Good spot if you are hungry and looking for some fresh, (mostly) healthy options."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to come here for two weeks now and finally stopped by on Thursday night 7:30 pm. It was a bit busy but still got a great seat, service was quick and our waiter was friendly.

Pros: great chicken with the honey sauce.
Big calamari rings with a sweet tomato sauce.
Salad was flavourful.

Cons: calamari body were over cooked couldn't eat them
Saganaki was deep fried and not what I'm used to.

Great little place but once you know what you like off the menu you will have a wonderful night."}
{"text":"Not my first time here, always satisfied with their chicken souvlaki, but really I mostly come because they offer the best lentil soup I've ever had.

Compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant est situé sur Duluth depuis toujours. J'avais le goût de me retremper dans des souvenirs de restaurants grecques que je fréquentais alors que j'étais au cégep. J'ai décidé d'aller a la maison grecque car il est resté selon certains commentaires gelé dans le temps. Le décor, la terrasse avec de grandes fresques bleus. Tout est pareil. Nous avons choisi la table d'hôte qui comprenait la soupe ,le plat principal , cafe et dessert .  Après le service de la soupe et était une soupe honnête aux épinards le serveur nous a amené une entrée offerte par la maison. Petits morceaux de spalakopita. Belle touche. Ensuite nous avons partagé un saganaki ce fromage de brebi pané et frit. Excellent.  Pour la suite ce fut la brochette de poulet et le shish kebab. Les deux plats étaient comme servis il y a 39 ans. Le bon vieux restaurant grecque des années 80. Le service fut parfait. Le serveur Tommy a été professionnel du début à la fin. Le stationnement n'est pas facile mais ça donne l'occasion de marcher sur la rue saint Denis pour regarder les nombreuses vitrines."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance et décor plaisant. Ma femme et moi adorons ce restaurant et les tenanciers. Nous quittons toujours ravis et rassasiés. Que de bons commentaires!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. It took at least 15-20 minutes to be served, another hour to receive the food. The scampies came without any lemon, which took another 20 minutes to get, and the waitress forgot twice (it was actually a busboy who brought them as soon as he saw we were impatient). By then, they were cold and inedible. We couldn't ask for fresh ones because no one came back to us. 

Both dishes (per menu and waitress confirming) were to be served with rice. The person who brought our plates just dropped it in front of us, without saying anything, and we had to call them back and ask where our rice was.

Another 15 minutes - halfway finished our plates - and they said rice was out. 

We asked for a credit of any kind, as why are we paying for a full plate when items are missing? 

The owner came to us about 30 minutes later, and refused to give any kind of credit though we paid for an item not there. He just stood there staring at us, and we had to explain our question over again. 
He was so condescending and never had a smile or even apologized for this experience thus far. We were calm and smiling but he was cold and made us feel humiliated. He said if we wanted to wait another 20 minutes, there would be more rice. Keep in mind that this simple meal had thus far taken HOURS and we already finished our plates. He also said the next time we come, he'd give us 3 rice plates to make up for it. Right; he would not even give a 50 cent credit but promised more food next time. How would be even remember us? He wanted us out of there. 
Again, this was the owner. 

There are so many better locations on the same street that go above and beyond for customer service, food, and ambience. 

Also: the deer mounted on the wall and dimly lit bathrooms seal the deal."}
{"text":"What a nice restaurant this turned out to be from start to finish I could not have asked for better service, it was an overall totally wonderful dining experience. LMG is a byow resto with a limited menu hitting the Greek food highlights; delivering some of the best perfectly cooked lamb chops I have had anywhere. The first standout was the house salad with their house made salad dressing, I would return just for that in a New York minute! The waitress said the chef makes it everyday and it has some 30 ingredients, I don't know about the 30 ingredients but at first bite I was elevated to a new sensory salad dressing experience that was mind altering. Ladies and gentleman this was an absolute palette explosion of dynamic yet variegated subtle flavors that will leave you speechless, breathless and with heart palpitations, it did me! Quebec lamb is some of the very best, even if you don't like lamb this would be the absolute perfect place to put that silly aversion to rest permanently. Cooked medium rare with hints of lemon and rosemary the flavor was downright scrumptious. For dessert I had the Galaktoboureko, one of my favorites; it too fell right in line with being one of the best, not overly sweet Greek desserts,I have had. 
It is interesting this restaurant was not my first choice as I was on my way to another Greek restaurant down the street but the line was out the door and I didn't want to wait. I have dined in many Greek restos in Montreal over the years; they have all been very good, some I have returned to several times. La Grecque Maison will be my first choice when I am in Montreal craving Greek food from now on hands down!!!"}
{"text":"My third time visiting. Their lentil soup is the best soup I've ever tasted and you can tell their food is made with love. Juicy chicken as well. Great music, prices,atmosphere and family run."}
{"text":"The taste was there ! Bonne assaisonement des brochettes de poulet et porc, salade avec vinagrette bien dosé, soupe aux lentilles gouteuses , dessert gateau carottes tres bon aussi. Musique grecque pour l'ambiance. Juste le service pas à son top .. manque d'employés :("}
