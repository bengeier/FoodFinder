{"text":"I'd been missing the pies of a kid named Joey who used to sling at the now-closed Sunset Pizzeria on EasternÃ—Sunset. Spent a couple years trying to find something as good as what he made.... And finally did, here at Mama DePalma's. It has become our go-to pizza spot. For us, this is as good as it gets.

One ding I can think of, though: they've been really lazy about ordering refills for their Coke Freestyle machine. I'd like it if they worked that out, ya know?"}
{"text":"Moma D's is my go to pizza restaurant.  I love it!!! Their menu is pretty big with a ton of different items to try.  I've ate at both locations and they are very clean and the service is outstanding.  I live closer the Stephanie location which is tucked away in the shopping center a little bit. I recommend you find it and try it, you'll feel the same way I do. 

Must do garlic knots!!!"}
{"text":"ive gone to this place 9 times
the pizza is good, there service and wait time SUCKS
why did it take you guys 25 min to cook fries and then i got UNDERCOOKED fries. this wasn't the first time they messed up, either, i gave them 3 chances now they are off my lunch rotation.
which sucks cos the food is good, but if you have a 30 min lunch skip this place coz you will wait 10 min  just for the cashier to charge you, and when you get back to work realize you fries arent cooked. just a big pain in the ass, again sad about having to break up with you Mama depalmas, it was good while it lasted.


SHOUT OUT TO THE CHEFF

not so much the rest of your staff....."}
{"text":"I ordered the other night and the food was good the French fries were golden brown the sandwich was delicious and it was delivered in a timely manner price was right around what everyone else is charging for what I've had to eat I will definitely order again"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Great authentic pizza. The girl at the front was a doll. Excellent excellent custumer service and food!"}
{"text":"Came when they first opened. Was tired of eating Pizza Hut pizza. Love that is family run and family  friendly. Great service love when the mom is working  she is funny. Fast service and great food. They always have a smile and it's always clean !!!"}
{"text":"Will def be back great taste and service is better ! Check this place out of you love that thin crust taste like our family"}
{"text":"Got a menu from them in our mailbox today and figured we would give it a try. We got a veggie pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, which came with free garlic knots, and a chopped salad. Delivery guy was friendly, and the food was outstanding. Huge portions, so much so that half the salad and all the pasta got put away for tomorrow night. The pizza was delicious! And I'm from NY so I'm picky about pizza. Everything was FRESH and filling. The delivery took about 50 minutes, but you could tell it was freshly made, so we didn't mind. Am definitely ordering from them again. It's the real deal!

Update: after 2 more orders, I wish I could give them more than 5 stars. Their cheese and white pizzas are like authentic NYC, and service has been top notch. So impressed!!"}
{"text":"Online order. We normally phone in our order to the Maryland Parkway store, but decided to go the online route from the Stephanie store, since we live between the two stores. Ordered stuffed bread, no extra marinara. Crispy chicken salad with extra large house Italian dressing in addition to normal Italian dressing (wife love their Italian dressing), bucket of fingers (25) and some garlic knots (no extra marinara). Order shows up within the estimated delivery time, so +1 stars. Bucket of fingers (25) consists of 11 chicken fingers, so a bit of false advertising. Asked for no ranch, recieve 2 tubs of ranch. Stuffed bread is good but no sauce. Salad shows with one small tub of Italian dressing, so there goes the $2 on extra dressing. Garlic knots are well cooked but again no sauce. I will have to visit the actual brick and notation store but by the results of online ordering, wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food...great price for families that cant afford big prices for to get there families a great dinner...they truly believe in the old saying your only as good as the people who work for ya..great staff and excellent cooks...."}
{"text":"Terrible. Soggy fries wings weren't cooked enough I asked for well done. I ordered the margherita pizza not enough basil mozzarella was not fresh at all. delivery  took 90mins."}
{"text":"I actually love this place! Got delivery for my dad's birthday and decided to try Depalmas since it's so close. We ordered a large cheese pizza with pepperoni and some chicken fingers. Delivery took just over 30 minutes, and the delivery girl was so sweet. The food itself was great! Will order again."}
{"text":"Pizza delivery 101: don't carry the pizza like a math book.
Though the mess I received did taste ok, having to peel cheese and toppings out of the corner of the box really put a damper on the meal"}
{"text":"Called to have food delivered to my sick sister in Las Vegas I called from California and Maria was great help!"}
{"text":"For a mom and pop joint it wasn't bad at all really. I had the chicken caesar salad and received a good portion for the price. I'd go back again, the staff was nice as well:-)"}
{"text":"Just found my new pizza place in the Whitney Ranch area!!  Delicious pizza and great service.  Love that you can see them make your pizza right there. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I order from Mama's all the time. We love everything we have ever ordered.  The pizza is great!  Being from Buffalo, NY we are experts on pizza and wings.   Their pasta and meatballs are great too!"}
{"text":"Good food and quick service. Pizza is a little over greasy but still taste excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service, great food, great EVERYTHING! Disregard everything the negative reviews say. This place is absolutely amazing.  10/10!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Everyone who works there is friendly and hard working. It's my new go to spot for pizza. Also have good wings and the fries were good too."}
{"text":"Mama de palmas hasn't disappointed us. I have to eat gluten free and am glad they have the option!! It's not certified and wouldn't work for celiac but it's good enough for me. Their wings are great. I'm weird and order them plain with wing sauce and ranch on the side. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. I didn't realize that there were 2 locations. I called my order into the wrong location. The guy behind the counter assured me that it wasn't a problem and called the other location to cancel the order. They made the order while I waited. I really felt bad, but they were so sweet and wonderful. Service like that is the reason I will always come back for my pizza fix."}
{"text":"Maybe my hopes were too high. Had the pizza, garlic knots, an order of regular fries, order of garlic parmesan fries, order of garlic knots, and the zeppoli. All were incredibly disappointing. The cheese on the pizza seemed like it had been frozen, it was just a solid slimy mass that came off the entire slice on the first bite. The sauce was a sad impression of sauce. Barely any sauce at all, it tasted like.... flavorless tomato paste. The garlic knots tasted like garlic knots only in the bites that you also got a piece of the chopped garlic that was smeared on them with oil. The fries were soggy and improperly prepared. The zeppoli were the best part of the order, and they weren't even good. I'll go ahead and order from one of the other pizza places over here that have way better food."}
{"text":"Worst service so far
Took longer that estimated and fetuchinni alfredo was made with spagetti."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice and helpful , I ordered a large cheese pizza that was very tasty. My only complaint was the thin crust was too crispy when I tried to fold a slice it just cracked not like New York where the crust is a lot softer. But that's just me overall it was very good"}
{"text":"ordered a cheese pizza and it took 50 minutes! enough said about this place. I was not told about a long wait or anything. I dont like when they take forever and dont tell think they should tell you why. I wont be going there again."}
{"text":"So the food is authentic, reasonable and amazing. Service is prompt and friendly. Great place to take family and a great place for date night. Chopped salads are so good. Grandma's pizza is outstanding and one of our favorites."}
{"text":"This place has great service and food. The wings are really good. Found this place on yelp glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Order from here once or twice a month for lunch at work.  Pizza arrive hot and tasty.  Have tried the mac and cheese - wasn't a fan.  Sticking with the \"za\""}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza wings special for $27.99 & was charged an extra $3 for doing half & half without being told of additional charge & also was charged separately $12.99 for pizza & $17.99 for wings instead of just giving me the $27.99 special that I originally ordered in the first place. When my wife called to  point out the mistake & overcharging, the lady on the phone that took our order \"Danielle\" was extremely rude condescending & her voice got louder & she tried to say \"I told you about the additional charges when you ordered\" NO! You did not, plus why would I order a $27.99 special when I'm not getting a $27.99 special?!! I have been a customer of this establishment for a few years and it seems like these kids that work here don't know how to provide customer service! The service has declined every time I go back.
I will not be going back again & I recommend for everyone to order from a different establishment!"}
{"text":"I get my pizza delivered from here. The pizza is good, but we also tried other things in the menu. Bad idea, I know. We get their BBQ wings, which is pretty good. I have tried their stuffed grape leaves, ehhh. No. Sometimes I get their tuna melt and other sandwiches, it's okay. Their fries are good. One time I had temporary insanity and ordered the 'ahi tuna salad'. Worst thing I ever did in my life. Worst thing I ever tried to eat. Rubbery 'ahi tuna' (it's not ahi tuna), literally rubbery. I was so pissed. Stick to their pizza, get your salads somewhere else."}
{"text":"The best Caprese salad I have ever had!
The linguine in vodka sauce was delicious as well.  I just discovered this little gem after living in the area for 5 years... And now I'm moving. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Ordered online, delivered in 30 minutes!! BEST PIZZA EVER! the cheese just melts in your mouth! I love pizza, but I'm a picky eater! I will DEFINITELY be ordering from them for now on!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza spot. I would recommend chicken and red onion but all their pies are really good. I've also had some of the pasta dishes and they are good too but nothing like the pizza."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. Food and service were great. Prices reasonable. Will add this to our short list of hidden east side gems."}
{"text":"I ordered the stromboli, the back east fries (poutine) and some garlic wings.

The Stromboli was AWESOME. The flavor, sauce, and fillings were all on par. Best stromboli I've had since moving down here. I will keep coming back for the stromboli alone.

The fries were also outstanding. Cheesy and delicious. I've had better fries in poutine, but they were still excellent.

The wings were probably the only thing to gripe about. They smelled and tasted fishy. By that I mean, they had a fish flavor to them. Perhaps as if they were cooked in an oven with fish next to it? Not sure. Not a fan of those though.

Beyond that, this place exceeded my expectations. Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Always great service and great food! We've never been disappointed :) the prices are very reasonable, especially the lunch specials. Professional, friendly, clean, inviting, courteous - can't beat it!"}
{"text":"People were nice and very helpful.  Unfortunately the food was very bland.  Apps were non event.  Mac & cheese had cream cheese. Just not reordering again."}
{"text":"Pizza has a moldy taste.  Chicken cooked to the texture of wood chips."}
{"text":"Good food Fast service . hubby loves there Canadian bacon and pineapple pizza . 
Salads are good, fresh. 
First time will be back for sure ."}
{"text":"Last couple times we've been there was not able to order food because all the tables were occupied. Also the last time they delivered we didn't get everything we paid for. Their food is decent though"}
{"text":"the food is always top notch on flavor. serving sizes are generous so come hungry! the staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. This is a New York style place so fellow local Chicagoans beware."}
{"text":"Must try their Fingers and wings! The sauce they use is delicious and I never get under cooked wings when I order them. They have some excellent sandwiches as well, I highly recommend the Fat Joe. They are also very speedy with their deliveries and never mess up my order."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with pep, sausage l, fresh garlic and extra cheese.  Big mistake... thw smell was driving me nuts all the way home. ;)    Have to say this is thw best Pizza i have found in Vegas so far and its really close to my sisters place."}
{"text":"I was anticipating the pizza and sub I ordered for dinner since my two lunch time excursions have been above satisfactory.  A big disappointment.  My pizza was undercooked.  I had to put it in my oven to finish cooking it in order to eat it.  Once I did that,  it was okay tasting,  but the pizza sauce was bland and the toppings clumped together like they were thrown on the pizza from the frozen state.  Not at all like it should be done.  The Belmar I ordered for the wife was promising.  You just can't put a roasted pepper and red onion on a microwaved piece of chicken breast and think that's going to taste good, let  alone be acceptable.  So, a small Bada Bing and the Belmar set me back about 21 bucks, and it went in the trash.  I called the store to advise them of their poor quality food and the lady on the other end of the phone was apologetic and reassured me that a 5 dollar credit would be added to my account the next time I ordered.  The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars was for the attentive customer service.  As far as the 5 dollar credit.  They can keep it.  There's way too many pizza places around here to put up with anything less than above average.  Sad.  I have to go and find myself another neighborhood pizza joint.  They're plenty around my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is very good. The garlic knots were not very garlicky .. The place is small and only had two TV's for sports. Not good for a large group. On the bright side the pizza was sooooo good!! The Parmesan was also freshly grated! The service was perfect . Our server checked on us numerous times . Overall a very good experience . Would def recommend."}
{"text":"I never thought my favorite pizza place would disappoint me so much. I put in my order and the guy on the phone said to give the driver an 1 hour to 1.5. I thought that was just an exaggeration but no. I ended up waiting 2 hours for a small pizza and some wings. To top it off, everything was cold and the fries I ordered were stale. It used to be the best pizza I had tasted but I'm gonna have to reconsider this place if I'm expected to wait this long for a small pie."}
{"text":"Really really greasy, dripping grease literally. Very sparse pepperoni. It was quick however, and open lateish in comparison to some other spots. Measly amount of parmesan packets and no red pepper flakes at all.  I don't think I'll try it again.  Papa John should sue for defamation."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town, WINGS are AmAzing ! Great staff always checking on you owners are fanatastic !!! Denfenitly  going back for more"}
{"text":"amazing pizza and flavor and chessy bomb bread sticks and awesome workers and good dine in also and they do slice by the pizza would really recommend this place"}
{"text":"Ordered on Yelp/Grubhub for delivery. Got here 10 mins faster than suggested. Driver was polite and friendly. Pizza was good. Not great, but not bad. But definitely good. The price, the service and food quality make it a great option for pick-up or delivery."}
{"text":"GREAT Gluten free pizza. I almost never bother to write a review about anything. I have to really hate it or REALLY love it. This pizza is great. I can hardly believe the crust is gluten free (I can't comment on their regular crust). We had two build your own pizzas -- one with bacon and tomato and one with sausage and mushroom. They were perfect--nice thin tasty crust. Amazingly, I think the crust was one of the best things about the pizza--and gluten free? Incredible. I highly recommend this place. I'll be back--probably tomorrow. :)"}
{"text":"Great food and always great friendly service! Have been going here and the other location in Silverado ranch for years. Prices are good as well."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fresh ingredients. This is my go to delivery place. Everything always comes on time, prices are reasonable, far superior to some of the other spots around me."}
{"text":"The owners have outdone themselves with this location. Beautifully remodeled and the staff are great. The food is superior to any other pizzerias my girlfriend and I have tried. Thanks Mamas!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and chicken wings. I don't know how people give this place bad reviews. Its some of the best pizza I've had in the area"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. We always drive by going to the other stores. So we decided to stop. Glad we did!
Pizza is slightly greasy but it is pizza I used napkins to tone it down. Lol 
Their not cheesy on the toppings. Which is great.
Ordered the appetizers sampler is good... fried...
Lol"}
{"text":"We ate in. I wanted some really good pizza, and not pay a fortune so we checked it out. Since it's small it was awkward eating in. But they were nice enough. The wedding soup was eh. The garlic knots were good. Pizza was good. Not great. But will just be a last option type of place. Crust and sauce are key and neither was a jackpot."}
{"text":"I love this place!  So friendly and the food is great , the pizza is the best pizza  , they deliver  and are pretty quick , I also love order wings from there  better than most wings I have tried .  Definitely a hidden gem  , I'm glad I found them !"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. We had our entire basketball team here and they were very accommodating! I had baked ziti with chicken... relish! Sorry I didn't post the picture because it was so good I ate it all not thinking to snap a picture."}
{"text":"I don't know what the problem is with them recently, but they totally suck. I placed an order, got a confirmation, and they didn't even deliver it. Can't get any worse than that."}
{"text":"Quick delivery. Pizza is thin crust so be warned if that isn't your thing.
It can be on the greasy side. Last order the pizza came cold and could have been cooked a wee bit more but overall I do like this place. 
They also have really good ranch (this is important) :)"}
{"text":"After being contacted by one of the owners, i am revising this review. We actually enjoy Mama's & the food is really good. I think issues are being addressed & improvements are happening. Not often does someone reach out & make an effort to make things right."}
{"text":"I've had the pizza here a few times to test it out and I'm not a fan! I picked up a pizza if you weeks ago and when they open the pizza to show me everything looked good but when I got back to my office I noticed that they were big chunks of burnt old food and pizza crust underneath my pizza in the Box! And the next time I went back there the week after I made sure to inform the lady up front about the situation and all she did was try to deny that it happened and said huh that's weird I've never heard of that before so I don't know! I expected maybe an apology or something of that nature! But still I wasn't that upset about it so I went back there again today to pick up a pizza and mozzarella sticks and everybody who ate the pizza got sick to their stomach and the pizza seemed very thin and did not taste right! I would definitely say save your money and go somewhere else! UPDATE I was contacted by the management at mama de Palmas with an apology! So I moved my review from 2 stars to 3 stars"}
{"text":"Wow. I just got the chicky chicky parm parm(chicken parmigiana) sub with some fried mushrooms and a drink delivered to my home and it was fast and delicious. Plus delivery chick is a cutie pie lol very satisfied and very stuffed"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and very cute place. Large portions. Spaghetti and lasagna was good. Shrimp scampi to much lemon and white traditional pizza needed more garlic and salt. Reason for 3 stars because 2 out of 4 entrees were good. Wil have to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"I wish I could of had a better experience here. This place went from 5 stars to 2 stars real quick. When we first walked in the waiter greeted us and sat us down. She was friendly. We placed an order of Garlic Parmesan Fries and a 10' inch (small) West Coast BBQ Chicken pizza.  Simple enough... Wrong! 

After we got our fries another waiter came out with the wrong pizza, the first waiter wrote down \"east coast\" instead of \"west coast\". So we had to wait another 15 minutes for our correct pizza. 

Ok cool, No biggie. It happens. Finally the waiter comes back out with our West Coast BBQ Chicken pizza only to find the pizza drenched in BBQ SAUCE!!!! You couldn't even see the other ingredients. Just a horrible saucy mess!!! Look at the pic if you think I'm overreacting. The waiter didn't think anything was wrong and told us to next time to order \"easy\" sauce. Ummmm hello! We order a regular BBQ chicken pizza smh we didn't even ask for extra sauce. The picture does not lie! My girlfriend and I ended up paying for our drinks and the fries and left that saucy mess of a pizza behind. 

Overall, the service was slow, and the waiters need to listen and double check customers order. The lobby was dirty and there was no staff to accommodate the customers. There were other customers who complained about the service and incorrect orders and ended up leaving. Just a bad experience. We are not coming back to this place! Period."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've ever had! And staff was very nice...quite a change from flamingo pizza,that place was a dump and the pizza even worst! ...keep the good pizzas coming mama pizza!"}
{"text":"I found this pizza place after going to Hobby Lobby next door & wow what a find! I love pizza & the fact they offer gluten free dough is great for my friends! Everything I've tried from here is so tasty with fresh ingredients & reasonably priced! I always order here when I have a get together, who doesn't love every thing Italian so yummy! Staff has always been wonderful too!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Ordered a veggie pizza with no cheese, extra sauce well done. Got a pizza with meat and cheese. I called and the young woman on the phone was not apologetic, but promised I would be the next order out and I would have it within 30 minutes. Sixty minutes later I got a basically unbaked pizza with a total of two artichoke hearts. $25 for this crappy pizza is ridiculous 

On the upside, the delivery driver was very nice and my dogs got to eat the first pizza, so they are happy."}
{"text":"I came here while traveling and staying with family nearby. I was starving and they were pretty fast. I got two large pizzas to go. The wait time was not too bad and the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"OMG..delicious! I am always checking reviews and wondring, who exactly, is writing them..affuliates, rivals, who knows. Tonite, football sunday. Ordered small pizza, wings, salad, chicken parmigan.Well it was HOT, on time and delicious....just saying....go for it! Sincerely, Lolo Gibbons"}
{"text":"The pizza came super cold as well as the garlic knots  and the cheese on both wasn't melted. 
Should have read the reviews"}
{"text":"One of the best wing places in Henderson. The sauce they use is delicious . Also they make an amazing philly cheese steak sandwich. The pizza is also delicious . the service is amazing and they are so helpful."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back here again! The service needs some work big time!!! They need to make sure they're taking and making orders correctly. The food was alright but honestly not worth the price nor the hassle of dealing with the employees who seem not to care."}
{"text":"If you want cold pizza that arrives 35 minutes after it is scheduled to arrive, order from Mama DePalmas!"}
{"text":"Some lady at your takeout restaurant was ordering over $200 food, and several personal orders worth no more than $45 orders.  You refuse my service (not even realizing we order from you every day) When we order $400 plus take out a week. You are our favorite place but you fucked up enjoy you will never hear from 6017 again and I promise you that was 50% plus of your delivery orders (and if not my block has over 5200 followers from local companies as your own)  haahhaa"}
{"text":"Visiting my mom here in Vegas and we were craving Italian. We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We are so glad we did! We got the eggplant rollatini - awesome! So cheesy and saucy! The garlic bread knots are great, too. I will want to come back here when I visit again!"}
{"text":"I want to give a shout out to the owner of this establishment for taking the time to call me after a misunderstanding with her delivery guy. The food here is great.  Back east fries (Disco fries) are incredible. The pizza is as good as your're gonna find in the  valley and the stromboli is a fat mans dream. Mom and Pop places like this deserve your business."}
{"text":"Food is amazing service is great can't get any better that!!! Always fresh garlic, sauce is outstanding, pizza is cooked fresh everyday. It's just like grandma's food!!!!"}
{"text":"EDIT: this has become my FAV pizza place. The cheese pizza is so delicious. It's the best cheese pizza I've had.. Ever. They have two locations, they can deliver both sides of Henderson, but it might take awhile. But it's well worth the wait!

Had two pizzas delivered to us while we were staying at Sunset Station. The service on the phone was friendly, even though we called half an hour before closing! We got the classic cheese pizza and the east coast style white pizza. Very good food!! Especially when you want to be lazy and just have a nice slice of pizza. The delivery boy was also very friendly, even though I missed his call twice he still hung around until I came out of my room! Will be returning :)"}
{"text":"I placed an order last night using online ordering for delivery of a four person dinner. They delivered it and when we started taking stuff out of bags we realized that some of our food we ordered is missing. We are on vacation and this was supposed to be a nice Italian dinner together and it's really sad when you pay close to $40 all together with food and tip of driver that food is missing and kids are disappointed. I called back to the place and was very disappointed with customer service. I STRONGLY recommend  to not do delivery from this place if you want to get all of the food you ordered."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I ordered the Buffalo chicken pizza and it was amazing. The only thing is the price was a little high for a personal size pizza. Other than that I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This pizza was super good! We got the \"back east\" & a cheese pizza w/ onions. The \"back east\" is a white pizza w garlic sauce & so yummy! Everything abt the cheese pizza was also delish! Might ask for a little xtra sauce next time on the cheese pizza."}
{"text":"My wife always loves the pizza but today we had the burger and it was great as well. They actually cooked it medium like we wanted. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick lunch delivery on a Sunday.  Mama's was the perfect choice! Garlic fries were amazing,  not overpowering with the garlic, pizza was a nice thin crust with just the right amount of sauce and toppings, but the best part of the whole lunch was the meatballs... Have not found meatballs like mom's but these are 99% there. Loved them!!!"}
{"text":"I had purchased a groupon ($20 worth of food for $10).  My husband and I went there this afternoon.  We were greeted warmly by MAX (cashier & order taker).  He gave us menus and also told us about the LUNCH SPECIALS.

We decided to order the lunch special - a mini calzone with a drink for $6.99.   OMG, they brought out this HUGE calzone and some delicious marinara sauce.  If that's what the mini looks like, I'd be scared to order a large!!  LOL.

The food was delicious, the portions large, the prices extremely reasonable.  Special thanks to MAX who made sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza spot in Henderson! They have a decent-sized menu and quick, friendly service whether you're dining in or ordering take-out. My usual order is a medium Margherita pizza with either garlic knots or french fries, which comes out to a little less than $20 and it's enough to feed a few. Their chicken finger baskets with ranch are also pretty tasty. NOTE: They've got the good ranch!!!"}
{"text":"I maybe just hungry when I found this mom and pop place to be soooo good! From the bread to the pasta to pizza, they are just phenomenal combination. I may not be the best person to judge what a good pasta place is(I'm a Pacific Islander/Asian, either/or), but I know that it put a smile on my face after that wonderful meal. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Came here on a school night with my grand daughter. Easy to find location. Grand daughter ordered French Fries for appetizer. They came out cooked just right. Grand daughter ordered small Pepperoni pizza and I ordered the 'Forget Papa' pizza. They came to the table 10 minutes after ordering them, freshly made and good and hot! Both pizza's were very favorable! Service was very good and the young man waiting on us was attentive and responsive with our additional requests. Bottom line - good location, great service, outstanding pizza and a great price!!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing Italian Resturant in Silverado Ranch. We love everything on the menu. We usually have it delivered because we live so close. Amazing, just try it!"}
{"text":"I decided to order from here about a month ago when I was craving pasta and they were the only ones that delivered to my job. After reading the reviews I still decided to order. I got the baked Mac and cheese with bacon. I was not disappointed!!!!!! It was cheesy and very flavorful!!!!!! The delivery lady was very very nice even with me forgetting to tell them to come to the back of my building. I have ordered two more times since then and I have not been disappointed. My coworker ordered the wedding soup and loved it. Their garlic knots are a miss but the main dishes are really good!!! This will be my pasta place when I'm at work!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mama's wings used to be SO bomb I would give them five stars but I'm only giving them four because they changed the chicken for the wings and now they aren't as good as they used to be! Please go back to the old bone in wings!"}
{"text":"We ordered here awhile ago. The service wasn't great. And the food matched the service. Thinking well get amazing pizza from the reviews. Instead we received a soggy pizza, literally..there was water in our box! And old salad. This review was long over due."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice,  quiet Pizzeria and found it in Mama DePalma's. My boyfriend and I split the Caprese Salad which was very generous for the price. We also split a large \"Jersey\" Stromboli which was almost too much for the two of us.  We decided to finish it up by sharing a Cannoli. All the food was good,  generous servings and I felt a good value for the cost. I will definitely come back and try something different."}
{"text":"We ordered over $50 of food via YELP for delivery. Smooth transaction. Delivery was timely and the driver was friendly. Fettuccine Alfredo was average. Greek salad was very good. Crisp lettuce and fresh vegetables. Nice portion size. Garlic knots were good but could of been better. We ordered a medium white sauce pizza with chicken. Crust was good. However the pizza was real dry. Very little sauce, cheese, and seasoning. The grilled chicken was very dry and old tasting. Not impressed. We had a $5 off coupon that couldn't be processed in the YELP app. Overall it was OK, but not for the money."}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to pizza and this place is Awesome! Excellent service! Very friendly staff! The pizza was fresh and delicious!!  Looking forward to trying their wings. Keep up the good work !"}
{"text":"Came here in my endless search of finding a good East Coast style pizzeria in the Henderson area.

My hopes got slightly down when I saw them working the dough with flour and not corn meal like my favorite places back in Boston. Got large cheese and some garlic nots.

The good: They don't use pasta sauce for pizza sauce (yes, there is a difference), the cheese melted evenly and was not oily (a sign they use quality cheese), and the dough was cooked evenly all the way through.

The not so good: The dough didn't have the 'chew' that I like. It broke apart a little too easy. Maybe they aren't using distilled water (tap water kills/hinders yeast)? Not letting the dough sit long enough (gotta let those protein bond build)? Don't know. All I know is that while not terrible, it didn't have that 'chew.'

The bad: Nothing to say here.

The 'A-OK' rating suits this place just fine. Not the best East Coast pizza i've even out there, and definitely not the worst. If I ever have to order a few pizzas for a party I'll definitely call here than the chain places."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them a few times and It's always been great .  This last time - missing French fries that I ordered , missing red peppers on salad and sandwich ...... Maybe new management ?  The food was not that good this time"}
{"text":"This place is DA BOMBA DE PALMA! From the service to the food, 5 stars easily.

Food: pizza was really delicious, not the best i've had, but definitely competes with the top contenders out there. The antipasto salad was amazingly delicious! I love vinegary food and this definitely satisfied my craving. The Italian Combo was without a doubt the best Italian sandwich i've ever had! What made it better was dipping it in the dressing and how soft the bread was! The wings were spot on and not too hot, considering it was the \"Fiery\" hot.

Summary: i am so glad to have come across this amazing neighberhood Italian gem!"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch from Mama DePalmas today. It was a first time for me. I ordered online for delivery because it is just too damn hot to go outside. Perhaps if I had gone in to the restaurant my food would habe been better and I could give a 4-star review.

I ordered an eggplant parm sandwich with a side of garlic cheese fries. A warning to you, when ordering a hot sandwich for delivery, expect everything inside that styrofoam clamshell to get soggy. The fries certainly were. The eggplant inside the sandwich too. It was all very oily too. My fingers and lips were glistening from all the oil contained within the box. Besides that, there wasn't much sauce on the sandwich which made it on the dry side (bread-wise). There was a fair amount of cheese but I would have preferred more. Further more, one end of the bread was burnt. It could have been taken out of the oven a couple of minutes sooner. 

Its not all a negative experience. Delivery felt like it took a little while but actually my food arrived a few minutes sooner than projected. The delivery driver was polite and courteous. There was a solid amount of eggplant on the sandwich. And the two pickle spears were a nice surprise.

I might try Mama DePalmas again some time but I think I may try a pizza. And I may go in. Food is always better fresh. Delivery tends to disappoint due to travel/wait time."}
{"text":"We usually are regulars here the pizza is always a hit but the sandwiches were so gross we got a meatball and a sausage and peppers and it was so dried out we couldn't even eat this food!! What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very late, cold and soggy. Worst pizza experience ever. You would think you couldn't screw up pizza. How hard is it to get 1/2 mile before it gets cold. Never again."}
{"text":"All I can say is how happy I am to have found a pizza place hat I enjoy. We ordered wings and fingers medium and they were delicious. I cannot wait to try their pizza and sandwiches. 

Delivery was super fast 

When we called to add our apartment number they were friendly. 

Ranch was so good 

Wings were like 6.00
Bucket of fingers was between 15.00-18.00"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, prices aren't bad, wonderful customer service. My group and I ate there march 3rd around 8pm. The young gentleman who took our order had alot to handle with my group of 5; we wanted 3 separate orders and one of the orders was large. He was on it with a smile and enthusiasm the whole time.
Definitely will eat there again."}
{"text":"The service in this place is great, the staff is excited to help and are good at what they do. Food is pretty decent, not amazing. I think their by the slice pizza is a good option. The pizza is not bad, and the pasta is eh. They charged me for chicken and never put chicken in the pasta which sucks since we took it to go. Probably will not be frequenting it here, but may be back if someone wants a casual pasta/pizza meal."}
{"text":"I finally made it into this place after passing it many times. Since nobody was dining inside on a Saturday night we made our order a to go order. The employees working that night were friendly and prepared our order in about 15 minutes. Pricing was on the inexpensive side.

My side salad was good size and only $2.99. It's mostly iceberg lettuce, but included a couple of other veggies. I liked the Italian dressing. The Meathead Pizza indeed included plenty of meat. The meat, cheese, and sauce were good, but not mind-blowing. The crust wasn't bad, but wasn't something I would crave later. We also ordered garlic bread which like the other times was okay. 

Definitely an A-OK option for someone in the area looking for a quick and inexpensive meal option. They deliver to the breweries on Eastgate as well."}
{"text":"The family and I had dinner here after visiting Ethel M cactus garden christmas display. We had the Bada Bing pizza, which is there fully loaded pizza. It had plenty of vegetable toppings but it made the crust a little too soggy and hard to eat by hand so we had to eat it with fork. The garlic knots were excellent. The high tech Coke machine was awesome! Overall I would return to eat here."}
{"text":"I really do love this place, but I am hesitant to rate them super well. They're a 5 minute drive away from my house, but every time we order it takes at least an hour for the food to be delivered to us- and the most I've ever ordered is a medium pizza with wings and fries. 

I understand that food takes a little bit to cook, and the last time we ordered was during prime football time, but still. We ordered a small pizza and garlic Parmesan wings. It took 2 hours to get there, and the pizza was completely cold. The wings were still warm, but they were also wrapped in foil so I think that was the saving grace. While we were eating I kept thinking \"wow, I wish this pizza wasn't so good!\" 

It is great food at a decent price. If they could just get their delivery wait times figured out, they would always be my go-to. Until then, maybe I'll try ordering it to pick up, or just plan on being in it for the long haul when I order delivery."}
{"text":"We ordered the stuff bread, garlic cheese bread, medium chicken wings and cheesecake. The stuff bread was fantastic, it reminds me of the pizza rolls we used to get in texas. It was a little greasy but super tasty. The garlic cheese bread was perfect, the crust was crunchy, the bread was buttery and the garlic was strong. The medium wings were actually a bit hotter than I was anticipating, but were delicious with a side of ranch. The cheesecake was average. It was soft, light and fluffy with a good base. Will definitely be going back, the staff was super friendly and helpful and their menu is so big, there is definitely more to try."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery to our hotel. My husband and I split a fettuccine alfredo with chicken, and it was a generous serving. The entree came with a salad and delicious garlic knots. In addition, we purchased garlic bread with cheese. Everything was very tasty and we were particularly impressed with the speed of delivery. The food came 45 minutes before it was estimated to arrive. We also enjoyed the fact that they included paper plates as well as Cutlery. The food was delicious, I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"WORST service. I keep trying to order from here because when the food arrives hot it is really good (see past reviews for details of 1hr 30 min delivery wait times to get cold as a rock pizza). This time I just received a coupon today in my email for $3 off $15 from their rewards program. Tried to place a phone order and am told on their end they can't find my coupon and thus can't honor it, all while i am looking directly at the coupon in my email from them with my phone number on it and a promo code. Are you kidding me?!?!?! YOU guys sent me the coupon and I can't even use it! Management really needs to get it together. Makes me so angry because when the pizza delivery comes hot it's delicious, but the bad customer service is not worth it. Plus it's like Russian Roulette if my pizza is going to coming in 20 minutes hot or an hour and a half cold."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to lunch spots when I'm at work. They are a great value for price and quality."}
{"text":"Made the delivery this time. thank you for the Pizza. The anti pasta salad was fresh and the pizza was decent. Tried the white pizza and it was good but we probably won't order it again. next time a different one or well try the fingers. Oh is gave us a reason to try again. very nice owner and tried to make it right for last time our delivery was blown off after 3 hours. Thank you Phil. See you again soon."}
{"text":"No complaints here! Ordered for takeout and the person was pleasant to talk to. 

The food was good! We got the fettuccini Alfredo,
Garlic knots, Italian wedding soup and some other pasta that I forgot. Can't complain about the serving size, well I wish the garlic knots had more servings because that was really good. It was soft and quite buttery. The fettuccini was pretty ok. It was creamy but a little on the bland side. Nothing a little pepper and parmesan can't fix.

Overall pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"Ordered the first time and will order again. The pizza was so good and the service was friendly over the phone. I spoke to Kevin when I placed my order. Fast delivery and cheaper than most. The slices are HUGE!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here for a few months now.
The pizza is delicious, the service is prompt, pizza has always been fresh. I have no complaints. I order extra cheese, pepperoni with black olive, mushrooms and fresh garlic. It's always been yummi."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices. Great food. Strange slogan. But I can over look that..."}
{"text":"PRO: Delivery came quick. Fingers where good. 

CON:I made an error in judgement in getting the east coast pizza, which it was nothing like NY pizza I was expecting. I did not receive my fries with my fingers either. Lastly although the food was edible the price was definitely not with worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places in Henderson.. price is reasonable and the food is pretty delicious. the only thing that keeps this place from getting a 5/5 star is the service. I believe it all depends on the people who are working on weekends vs weekdays. My go to pizza is their Alfredo and Badabing! I got the meathead last night and it was ok. I like their pepperoni slices at lunch also with a side salad but last night the pizza was kinda off."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Calzones and strombolis! The guy getting our food was real cool and with the quality of the food, we left really happy."}
{"text":"Amazing wings but terrible fries burnt and looked like they were reheated DISSAPOINTED"}
{"text":"Delivery is not their forte. We ordered from them once and the food was fresh and fast. This evening was a total disaster. We waited an hour and a half for delivery. The fries basket was completely inedible. The $4 basket was soggy, over cooked, and shriveled. The Philly steak we ordered was edible, but the bread was soggy and tasted of pickle juice. The pizza we ordered was cold and the outer crust was so hard we couldn't eat it. My husband hasn't tried his meatball sub yet, but I do not have high hopes. This restaurant should not be on Eat24. We will not be ordering from this restaurant again. Delivery orders...beware."}
{"text":"Welcome to Mama DePalmas Pizza & Bistro . We were craving some pizza and had not tried this place yet. It sits close to home and I saw some of the reviews, so we gave it a try. We ordered pick up. Large Pepperoni, wings and fries. The Pizza is non descript, could have been crispier. Maybe I can order it that way but we did not so there could be a factor in that. Wings were zesty but lacked any form of meatiness. Fries were greasy and lacked flavor [unless greasy is a flavor]. Staff was friendly and food ready when I arrived to get it. Price is nominal for take out pizza. Thank you for dining at Mama DePalmas Pizza & Bistro. Can't say I will order here again with so many more great places around the homestead. If you want something average for a pizza night this place will fill you up, but won't knock your socks off."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great prices. The full menu offers a wide variety of options. The stuffed bread and fried mozzarella are a unique menu items I have not found anywhere else in town."}
{"text":"Good pizza, just not very timely. Two hour wait on a 14 inch pie and mozzarella wedges. Not the first time I've waited this long for an order from this place, unfortunately. 
Ordered at 6:20 pm, did not get my order until 8:40. Food was barely warm when it got here. Didn't even offer to make up for the order being late, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Pizza wasn't good. Service was bad. We were referred to this place by our favorite pizza place in town (they are kinda far from us).  When I showed up my pizza was just being pulled out of the oven and I thought that was perfect timing.  Well the chef dropped it - no big deal accidents happen right.  Well the cashier, some tall younger guy, was more than rude about it.  He said some snarky remarks and told me it would be another ten minutes or so.  No big deal but he could have at least offered me a soft drink while I waited.  We wont be going back.  It just wasn't worth it - we will make the trek to the other side of town for our fav pizza joint."}
{"text":"My new fav. The prices are reasonable and there is plenty enough food to eat for two days. The garlic knots are big and not too garlicky. You get some with your meal which we didn't realize so days later still eating them. We were greated quickly by all the employees which was nice. It is a small place but clean and cozy. If you can order ahead because it does take a little while to get your meal. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Service is always great here. The calamari is tasty and the chicken Alfredo pizza is yummy!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town... and I'm super picky. If you are looking to cater a party get the food from here... wings are larger, the texture is crispy, and the flavors are great.  Get the hot or Hawaiian style...or both!  All the pizzas are phenomenal.  Whether you're eating their or going out... this place is a must."}
{"text":"Sadly, I used to truly enjoy this place. It's familiar and has been a great go-to spot for some time. 

However, the last few visits have been very disappointing and this evening sealed the deal on never visiting ever again. Here's the real truth restaurant owners - the very last thing you should do is argue with a customer. Even more that you work so hard to defend your point that it embarrasses your establishment in front of everyone in the restaurant. 

This is what happened; 

Placed a pickup order as usual. It's simple - a pizza, an eggplant parm and calzone. Quoted 15-20 minutes for pick up. 

No problem so far - show up about the 20 minute mark. 

Walk-in and surely they aren't busy and the meal is ready. As I willfully fork over nearly 50 bucks for what I would expect to make most other establishments put to shame? I'm greeted with a small problem. 

What's worse is I had to notice the problem. I ask - \"where's the eggplant parm?\" 

The girl at front looked around for a bit confused and then in a shocking way looks at me and goes - \"oh no - I'm sorry\". 

What happened is they never took the eggplant out of the oven. So as we are looking at this blackened Eggplant Parm dish they turn and ask if I still \"want it\". 

Uh. Of course I still want it and knowing that this is a menu item that takes several minutes to make - I begin to ask if they will remake the other parts of my meal so that everything comes out hot and fresh. 

Keep in mind. This is not my fault. I did nothing but show up and support this company by spending good money on good food. Instead what I encountered is argument and backlash. Then promised that the dish would be done in 2-3 minutes.  

I'm taken back by this. You mean to tell me it takes 2-3 minutes to make eggplant Parmesan? I mean sure I'm a microwave but now I am to question to integrity of this dish and how's its prepped and made? 

I kindly repeat to the gentleman, as he's suggesting I \"wait for my food a and he can keep my food hot\" that I would prefer it were made right, and without much pushback. I remind him that the \"food\" he is referring to has sat on the counter through this whole controversy and is cooling every second we talk. 

Finally with the most disgust he remakes the order and now I'm waiting for 15 more minutes.

Thank you but now I won't be coming here again. Because no matter how great the place is - this is not how anyone should be treated. Especially when you as the customer are spending hard earned money for your food, products or service. Period. 

Restaurant owners, you have a responsibility to represent your community well and give great service as well as always make it right."}
{"text":"We has a cheese Pizza and was good, it got loud while we were eating and the young lady who waited on us, look like she just rolled out of bed (Bad Hair Day).

Like the pizza, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have had pizza from here before and it was not bad. My review is based on customer service/delivery.

Ordered for delivery... I wait over an hour then called the restaurant to check status. Apparently the person who was supposed to deliver my food got pulled over and car got towed so my food was gone. I was told they would re make my order and allow another hour for it to arrive. I said ok but decided after 5 minutes or so that I didn't even want the food especially if it's another hour wait. So I called to cancel and ask about refund but the guy who answered said he could cancel my order but not able to do the refund... 


UPDATE: 
10 minutes later a manager called to apologize and offer discount for my next purchase and also a free dessert which was nice. The manager was very friendly and apologetic so, I will give them another shot."}
{"text":"I've been getting pizza from here for a few years now. Fast friendly delivery, delicious cheese pizza. 

There have been some other things on the menu I didn't particulate enjoy but the pizza is always a good choice! 

I've ordered so many times that of course there are going to be a few problems here and there like when an anchovies pizza was accidentally sent! They made me a new one and brought it over. 

I once accidentally had the wrong address marked and they went and made a new pizza and brought it all the way to me! 

5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Staff goes out of the way to make sure your experience is a good one, very friendly and food was worth the drive."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that I didn't go with lil Caesars $5.00 pizza.  Honestly $16.00 for some mediocre at best large pizza. Lil Caesars is actually better.  Not to mention the hour wait for delivery."}
{"text":"Wel did a delivery to a local brewery that doesn't serve food. It came in pretty good time and delivery guy was cool. The only reason for 2 stars. 

On the food side,the pizza, not so great. We ordered a Sonny which was the better of the 2 but after 1 slice I started to not like it so much. I think a lot in due to the not so great crust. The other was the Back East Traditional. No flavor whatsoever. Wish I had some ranch that might have helped. Lol and again the crust sucked. 
 
Not likely to return or order again."}
{"text":"Blaze pizza was alot better more choices lot better pizza not bad but ingredients were so so"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp users for recommending such a great place!  I ordered for our soccer team and the girls just LOVED IT!  The pies were HUGE and fed everyone and delivery was quick!  Next time we're in Vegas this place is definitely on the dinner in list!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but i just didnt. When I called they were very friendly and they delivered my order quick but unfortunately good service can't make up for unpleasant food. I ordered a large pepperoni and sausage pizza and a small white pizza. The white pizza lacked any flavor at all.  I took a bite of it and I knew I had something in my mouth but it didn't taste like anything.  It needed salt or something. The pepperoni and sausage pizza had a funny flavor to it and the sausage had a really weird consistency and was super rubbery. I really really wanted to like this place because I desperately want a local pizza place to order from but alas this is not it."}
{"text":"This place has good pizza and wings. This is the only mom and pop pizza shop I would actually give my attention to in this area. The owners are super friendly and are from the Buffalo,NY area so they know their way around pizza. Not greasy just perfect. This is the closest to New York City style pizza you can get in our area. Stay away from the big chains, and spend your money on this place. Quality pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a half cheese half Hawaiian with some wings and fries,,, 
The pizza was made wrong, but they were quick to remake me one and send it out!! The crust is so soft and good, the sauce and cheese are delicious and you can tell it's good quality stuff! 

The wings are amazing! The island sauce is probably the best sauce I've ever had from a pizza place, the fries weren't that great but the pizza and wings made up for it, 

Shawn was my delivery driver and he was apologetic when he came back with the new pizza, but he was so nice both times I saw him, gave home a couple more dollars for driving back a second time, this will definitely be my new go to pizza place!!"}
{"text":"This review went from what would have been about a 4 down to a 2 based on poor customer service. I was quoted 45-60 minutes, and didn't get my food more than an hour and a half. I called the restaurant and they were not in the least apologetic. They just said they were busy and it would get here in a half hour. Not impressed with the tone of the woman on the phone. The food was okay. 3-4 quality. The portion for the ravioli was on the small side. The cheesecake was not very good. The tiramisu was good. The salad was pretty much just iceberg lettuce and a very little tomato and a few sliced olives. Small, but included which is nice. Overall meh."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken parm sub and some garlic knots. The chicken in the sub was cooked too long and became a bit rubbery. The \"garlic\" knots were not that at all. More like bland bread balls. 2 stars because it was fast and the delivery guy was nice. Unlikely to order again, unfortunately, as it's super close to my house."}
{"text":"This place has lunch specials and is pretty tasty. It's not slap-your-mama good but, for lunch, after shopping, it works every time."}
{"text":"We ordered large pizzas last week and every one got sick- stomach problems almost immediately after one slice and wasn't right for 2 days.  Not exactly food poisoning but something was way spoiled.  Never again.  It was a 3 pizza anyway without the gastro issues.  Sorry mama."}
{"text":"I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs was great I would recommend this place to people to try some good Italian food."}
{"text":"We ordered Calzones, and an order of garlic knots.  It was good, and the ingredients were fresh, but it was pricey!!  $35 plus tip for pizza delivery?  Never again.  We could have gone out to dinner and had a waitress and someone else clean up the mess for $35.  Sorry Mama DePalma....won't be ordering from you until those prices drop."}
{"text":"I got the 23 for 30 deal and got a 3 cheese pepperoni, garlic bread, garlic fries and an extra large sauce side. The pizza was awesome!!! The sauce we used to dunk the crust in and that was delicious also....garlic bread was average and the garlic fries I won't get again....tasted like fries with cheap parmesan dumped all over them...I've had way better garlic fries at other places (Sammy's L.A. pastrami) to get them here again. Also I picked it up after reading some real bad reviews about their delivery. Will definetly be back for pizza tho!!"}
{"text":"We are from Chicago-land so finding a good pizza place is a challenge. We got a sausage pizza and pepperoni calzone. Both were good--a little greasy but tasted good. The crust was delicious and the pizza was cooked just right (crunchy and chewy). Ample toppings. I asked for half the cheese in the calzone and that was done for us. Service was friendly and quick. We had coupons which they honored. We will order again."}
{"text":"Great food called in order for pick up and they have p/u special $10 for large pizza it was great hot fingers really good.  We will be going again and it's right by my work the gave a ton of lunch specials will have to try that...."}
