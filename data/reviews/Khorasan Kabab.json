{"text":"Fantastic koobideh! Been to a bunch of Persian places in NYC and Toronto and this place ranks highly. The meat is very good quality and BBQ'ed to perfection. They also serve Persian tea for free!"}
{"text":"Although the decoration is not fancy but the food quality is really nice and the staff are friendly. Also the prices and portions seams reasonable."}
{"text":"Love the barg.Amazing cook and waiters.Althought a bit expensive its really worth it."}
{"text":"Mirzaghasemi was great. Other foods were cold and below average. Service was poor. This place is falsely 5 star rated. Don't expect a 5 star service and food from here."}
{"text":"This is by far the best kebab in Montreal. Well spiced, expertly grilled as well as a generous portion. The owner is always there in the kitchen , greets you with a nod and goes on doing what he does best. Service is genuinely friendly and not fake. They know my family and treat my two baby girls like royalty. Top notch if you actually care about the food and not the decor"}
{"text":"In respect to the old saying .... Don't judge a book by its cover....  From outside (and inside) of restaurant sadly doesn't look very... Appetizing due to faded colours and non existing to outdated decor. Nevertheless, my gf and I were feeling adventurous and determined to try something new and with the help of previews yelpers we throughly enjoyed our meal.  We were greeted shortly after we walked in.. Very friendly. Ordered their 2 ppl combo which came with salad and soup.  Salad is salad but I really liked the fact that they gave me the sauce bottle (I'm a sauce guy so I appreciated it :p)  Soup was different... Unique... Not bad... Not excellent... Just ok... Won't order again though.  Just as mentioned by previous yelpers... EXCELLENT, flavourful and super tender kebabs..... My personal favourite... Filet mignon... Simply BEST I've had in long long time. Hands down... MUST try.   Good portion, good price.. Definitely coming back for Filet.  Forget how the place looks... Food will make up for it."}
{"text":"Got take out from Khorasan Kabab so can not comment on the restaurant decor. The barg and jooje kabab were delicious, juicy and very flavorful, the meat was so tender it practically melted in your mouth. The rice was delicious as well, especially the dill rice that is served alongside the salmon. The ash soup was just ok, nothing special. I did not like the koobideh, both the chicken and beef versions were a little over powered by a strong meaty taste and lacked seasoning."}
{"text":"One of our favorites in Canada.  Not a place known for its ambience or for a romantic night out. But the food is at a different level whether it's eat-in or take out.  Burg is amazing and chicken (boneless or on the bone) is flavorsome. We also tried their mixed grill and found the shish kebab to be desirable.  Main distinction to make is that Persian food is not spicy but very flavorsome so our kids love it too and actually demand that we get food from Khurasan whenever we are in a conundrum.   The big let down is that it is normally closed for summer vacations as well as winter vacations!! Go figure. I didn't realize they were somehow affiliated with and regulated by a school board!!!  So if it's one of those days when you are craving for buttery rice with grilled tomato alongwith tender meat, and it happens to be a school holiday of some sort , you are in for a disappointing ending.  Despite this major flaw, I hesitate to rate Khurasan  anything but 5 stars. Khurasan -  those scorching days and freezing nights when your team went missing were painful ....but hey everyone deserves a family break."}
{"text":"Great Persian food! As an Iranian I definitely approve the food here. My personal favorite plate on the menu is \"kabab barg\" with rice and \"ash\" ! The staff is very friendly and inviting. I've been coming here for over 3 years and the  quality and service have stayed top notch!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite iranian restaurant, i've been to ALL of them and this one is hands down the best. Service might be slow sometimes but oh the food is absolutely delicious, I always order the mix koobideh sometimes the joojeh and the salad dressing is out of this world. Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"As Iranians, my family and I really liked this place, and the prices were very reasonable too (portions were great). The typical kabobs - chicken, beef koobideh, barg (steak) - were all good quality, soft, and tasty.  They come with either soup or salad, but the soup is actually a nice bowl of aash (hearty soup with lentils and some other good ingredients), which surprised me considering aash usually is served as a separate appetizer that you have to order at most Iranian restaurants. Our waitress and the service were also good. The vibe of the place is casual, which was fine by us, and if you're new to Iranian food, it's very helpful that their menu has photos of every dish."}
{"text":"SImple place but excellent kebabs. Tender meat and spectacular rice & soup"}
{"text":"Solid 3 to 3.5.  Keep reading.    Normally I preface my reviews with a blurb that may or may not be related to the subject matter, but let's get down to business.  Khorasan had an uphill battle in my eyes.  I'd been burned twice before by a Persian restaurant by me back home in Jersey, but my wife was looking for a less-heavy meal and she perked at Khorasan in hopes of the Wednesday special, a chicken stew sorta thing.    I was skeptical, and she raised a good point: it wasn't like me to condemn an entire cuisine at the fault of one restaurant.  It was also literally 5 years since we went.  Off to Khorasan Kabab, then.    We sat out front, they brought out pita bread.  And pats of butter.  What?  I mean, okay, bread and butter I get... pita bread I get... but butter?  Is that just a Canadian thing, to get butter with pita?    Here comes one star off.  The pita bread was clearly from a bag.  That I can forgive.  The pita was not warmed up.  That too I can forgive.  But the pita was stale.  100% stale, breaking when you bent it or pulled it.  That's a triple combo that could have easily been broken.  One star down.    The server said that today's special was lamb shank.  This was a Wednesday, and the photo of the review mentioned the nice looking chicken stew dish.  We asked if that was available - no luck, it was yesterday's lamb shank.  Okay, fine, she'll have the chicken koobideh, since she's restricted due to medical reasons from most red meats.  I went for the lamb shank.   The meal came with soup or salad.  I wanted the salad, my wife went for the soup.  The salad was iceberg lettuce.  That plus the specials mix-up?  C'mon, man, we came here for the Wednesday special on a Wednesday.  It was even on the menu in front of us.  Together, .5 star off.  Learn about romaine lettuce, people!   The mains, though?  BOOM.  Dynamite.  Amazing.  100% redeeming Persian cuisine, her chicken kebab was perfectly PERFECTLY juicy and seasoned to a point where it TASTED GREAT AS A CHICKEN DISH, not IN SPITE OF being a chicken dish.  A nice herbacious almost saffrony flavor, perfectly seasoned.   My lamb shank was stellar.  The meat came right off the bone, and its braising liquid was this rich but semi-thin tomato gravy that was amazing on the dill lima bean rice with which it was served.    Complementary tea came at the end.  Good stuff.    I'd definitely recommend Khorasan, but they do have to do something about the pita and the lettuce used in the salad.  Don't hesitate to come here!"}
{"text":"Norriture tres simple , le local de l'exterieur parait un peu comme fast food mais il y a des vrai tables bien mises à l'interieur. La bouffe pas tres epicé mais ca fait la job.."}
