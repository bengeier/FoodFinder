{"text":"Had the Drake burger, which was on promo for their 10 year anniversary. I thought that the burger was pretty good; I really liked the cheese and the bacon was very smokey and flavorful. I really like the bun - it was slightly chewy and toasted with butter. Also came with a pickle. 

What really stood out were the fries that came with the combo. I believe that the fries were twice fried with sea salt. I am definitely a fries girl and these were one of the best! I probably wouldn't pay full price for the burger ($19), but perhaps I would might just to have the fries."}
{"text":"Had a very nice brunch here with a big group of friends including a baby and children. Food was very good but service left a lot to be desired. The waitress was surly and sullen. She couldn't be bothered greeting us and hurried us through the meal taking condiments away before the food was done. Too bad cause the food especially the scones were really good."}
{"text":"This is my husband and my go to brunch spot and not just because we live close by! I LOVE the smoked salmon - either on a bagel or the benny, it is hot smoked and flaked not like a lox or gravlax style. The regular Drake benny is equally delicious as is the regular breakfast. I had a bite of fried chicken and waffles for the first time last week, chicken is boneless which I enjoyed. It's not really my thing but each element was executed well (crispy chicken, fluffy waffle, tart cherries).

The hot sauce is hot but also has some flavour, I'd almost call it apricot-y. Use it sparingly but on any egg or potato dish.

Don't miss the Caesar if you're in the mood, plenty of horseradish for a nice kick. If you don't feel like alcohol, the latte is so creamy and delicious, always a nice treat. 

Reasonably priced for the quality. Patio is a great scene in the summer, nice people watching."}
{"text":"First time I went in the spring it was just the best on the roof bar.  Went again in July and it was packed, roof was closed for a private event and service was sub standard.  It put me in a bad mood.  Probably my last visit."}
{"text":"(This is for the dining room):
We went last night and they were having this special \"Swedish Berry\" event (you'll have to look that one up on-line).  Anyway, as a result of these crazy berries the place was rammed.  Despite this, our waitress was absolutely wonderful, kept us informed of the delays (due to Swedish Berry people) and kept our drinks flowing.  The food was great, the service topnotch and as always, a feast for the eyes.
Oh, and I'm going to have to go back for the next Swedish Berry night just to find out what all the hoopla was about."}
{"text":"I went to the Drake for the first time on a Sunday just for drinks with a few friends.  Place is nice, decor is cool.  They had a band down stairs which was not my type of music but still cool.  Service was good.  

I will come again on a more hyped night. Sunday seem like a good date place!

p.s We didn't order any food so no comment on that :)"}
{"text":"The place is just okay. I'm a former long-time Torontonian, so I \"get\" The Drake. It was never my scene, but I have been privvy to the VIP bottle service on a Saturday night just so we could have somewhere to sit in their nightclub for someone's birthday. The Drake was somewhere I would often go for brunch or sometimes the Underground to see a band. Room 201 is nice enough, but it feels more like a luxury hostel above a bar instead of a boutique hotel. No bathtub, just shower with some nice bath products. 

I understand why someone would be tempted to book a room here because Toronto's idea of downtown west accommodation does not extend beyond Yorkville really. BUT- I do not understand why someone would willingly pay $329 to NOT sleep on a Saturday night. It's robbery. I'm tired and pregnant and was given ear plugs by the front desk reception. Ear plugs aren't going to stop your whole room or bed from vibrating from 11pm to 2:30am. I mentioned this to the server in the cafe the next morning when I was expressing disappointment that I had to wait 40 minutes before brunch was available (I only agreed to stay here because I was looking forward to chicken & waffles!), and she turned it into a huge issue, calling over the hotel manager to interrogate me at my table about why my travel agent hadn't conveyed to me the noise reality on a Saturday night. Look, the booking was for my husband's work, I wasn't the main point of contact, and I don't care what you told a travel agent - it's disgusting to charge that much for that room with that level of noise/vibration reality! I did not ask to speak to Jonathan and I didn't feel much like having an argument about the whole issue. I was on no sleep two nights in a row and wished I had just stayed home with a toddler that woke me up crying every two hours than stay at The Drake. He just kept going on about how I should have known and I should have been fully aware of the noise, and how I would never find another equivalent hotel in Toronto during PDAC for that price. Dude, whatever - if you can sleep at night (assuming you're getting sleep because you do not live at The Drake) charging that much for that room, knowing the guests aren't going to sleep, then good for you. I don't care. At Long Beach Lodge in Tofino, BC (basically the coolest, best place to stay in Tofino), there was 1 room left on a Friday night, situated above their bar/restaurant. They offered it during high season on a weekend for $199. It's a nice room and equal to all their other beachfront room, except for the NOISE factor, so they offer it at a major discount to the other rooms. Not so at The Drake. Cuz you should have known.

I stayed again on Monday night in the same room and it was noisy (in the bathroom you could hear the band crystal clear), but at least I could hear actual distinct songs instead of just horrible noise and bass with the entire room shaking like I did until 2:30am on Saturday night. I read a magazine and waited it out until about 1am when it went quiet. Was it more restful than the Saturday night? No, because the manager JONATHAN called our room early the next morning frantic about my original Tripadvisor review, waking us up!! He thought it was scathing (it was not scathing about the hotel, just him and his attitude) and wanted me to take it down. I woke up to my hubby putting a laptop in front of me, asking me to remove it. I only did so to avoid a fight because he didn't know about my previous unpleasant interaction with Jonathan. When I took it down, Tripadvisor makes you choose a reason from a drop-down menu, and if I was being completely honest, I would have chosen \"being harrassed by the owner/manager of this establishment\", but I did not. Five minutes later, Jonathan, who was not on-site that day, called my hubby's CELL PHONE to make sure that I was taking it down. Um, inappropriate much? Dude needs some boundaries and to think about whether his actions are improving a guest's experience or making a guest feel BETTER about staying here...or whether his actions are self-serving and only making himself feel better. To call us early in the morning and wake us after having yet another horrible night's sleep there? To come between a COUPLE and cause an argument first thing in the morning over something so stupid and petty??  Come on. The proper reaction to my original review below would have been an APOLOGY and maybe buy me a latte in the cafe to help me get through my drowsy day!  
If you have problems at the Drake, I suggest you speak with the guests services manager, Jon, instead of Jonathan because he just doesn't get it and can't get past his own agenda and defenses. Being defensive doesn't make a guest feel better about their bad experience. Seriously, get a hold of yourself, Jonathan!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic meal with a couple of girlfriend here! This is definitely a go to spot if you want a lively ambience. Great atmosphere as the restaurant showcases its attitude with colourful frame and sculptures hanging from the walls and ceiling and the bar supported by a pipe? Interesting indeed.
Food is unique and delicious though prices are a bit steep. That's what you get for eating at \"the Drake\". Our dinner included a bunch of enjoyable appetizers and a bunch of sushi rolls (as recommended by our server which was surprisingly very creative and yummy!). RECCOM: B.C. Kimchi Roll, Baked Mac'N' Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries and Prosciutto Flatbread."}
{"text":"I try, so hard, to like the Drake. So hard. I try to like it because it's so pretty to look at and location-wise, it's perfect. But the vast majority of experiences I've had there have been average at best and bad at worst. 

The Drake's food is usually good. Not great, but not awful. The wait to get said food, however, is always far longer than you'd think (unless the place is empty). The service is hit-and-miss: Either you get an attentive server/bartender or someone who wouldn't notice if you were on fire. And god forbid you, upon standing at the bar for a long while, have the temerity to summon a bartender who is off playing grab-ass with a waitress. If you are brazen enough to do that, you will get treated rudely and overcharged. I worked a bar for ten years -- I know the \"I'll charge for two singles instead of one double\" trick. I also know when I'm getting short-poured. 

Whenever I think of the Drake I think of an absurdly attractive person who never had to learn to be nice, or interesting, or whatever else because all their life they've been popular, liked, loved and praised based solely on their looks. I know that a lot of people like the Drake, but too often I find that the place, food and drink-wise, is coasting and is given a pass because man, it's just so damn pretty -- and the tie goes to the stunner."}
{"text":"i used to consider the Drake one of the most enjoyable restaurants in the city.  The food and service were excellent, and the atmosphere fun.  i was appalled to arrive tonight to be treated to tacky \"high school cafeteria\" menus (this apparently is the new theme in the dining room).   When we asked about the real menu, well, it was only available in the lounge (taken up by bingo night or whatever, or the humid cafe).  

While the Mac & Cheese was there, the steak we ordered was only meh (for $80), the fried chicken we ordered as an appetizer took about 40 minutes to arrive ( about 3 minutes before the mains arrived), with none of the delicious bread with spicy ricotta cheese that used to come with the meal.  The waitstaff inaccurately (and unappetizingly) described some of the dishes like the fried chicken and salmon.   They were not knowledgable or helpful as they had been in the past.  

I really can't imagine what the management was thinking when they threw of the \"yoke\" of a great schtick, but this new theme is a disaster.  The drake thinks they're too cool for school now or something, but they're off the list now."}
{"text":"Our stay at The Drake Hotel made our recent trip to Toronto perfect!  

The front desk staff could not have been more accommodating.  The fellow working the desk on Sunday afternoon June 21st 2014 was extremely helpful when we asked where we could rent bikes he said no need we have 2 bikes here for our guests to use.  He provided maps which included bike routes, 2 helmets and a complete overview of the locking system of the bikes.  Check in was easy and helpful.  

We were given a 10% discount voucher for the hotels gift shop which came in handy the following day when we shopped for a few souvenirs.  The gift shop is not your typical hotel gift shop they are well stocked with great T-Shirts, clothing, jewelry & everything in between.  

Our room was clean, well stocked with towels, toiletries & reading materials.  The bed was comfortable as were the pillows.  The hotels internet was easy to navigate and we had absolutely no issues the entire time we were online.  So many funky cool items throughout the room such as the stuffed animal on the bed, the minibar, and the items in the basket from their gift shop.  

We had breakfast in the restaurant adjacent to the hotel.  The food was very good, and our waitress could not have been more pleasant.  Newspapers available which is always a bonus.  

I highly recommend booking your next stay at the Drake Hotel.  Note they do not have an elevator but the staff at the front desk is more than happy to assist with your bags.  If the bikes are available be sure to use them it is a great way to see all of Toronto without the hassle of a car. 

Thank you to the staff of the Drake Hotel for making our first trip to Toronto a memorable one!"}
{"text":"What a delightful reprieve from the dolldrums of business travel hotels!  The Drake is undeniably boutique & fun - but didn't omit those things that make one comfy while on the road.  The Drake makes being in your room really great - but who wants to be in your room when you have access to a cool roof top bar or a great breakfast nook.  

The neighborhood is majorly interesting. Plenty of restaurants, cool shops and wacky little dives."}
{"text":"We went to the Drake for dinner on a Friday evening. The ambiance was excellent and the service was good too. Unfortunately, that was all that was good about the place! The food was below average at best. We started with the bread and things which wasn't great. It was overly salty and really greasy. Then the main's arrived. My burger was so salty I was not able to finish it. My wife had the same issue with her steak frites. The steak was not hot and the sauce seemed like it was made of salt. 

We sent them an email about their food quality and no one bothered to email us back. 

We won't return there for dinner again."}
{"text":"You take the Queen Street streetcar past this place and you know the clientele that comes here is what some would say \"Seen to be seen.\" That said, you should absolutely check this spot out. 

The cocktails here are delicious, especially the Paper Plane. For my entree, I ordered the seasonal pork sausage over lentils to match my drink and I couldn't have picked a more perfect dish.

Service here is attentive and really respectful given the demand that this place clearly has. Even the price point, which is not cheap by Toronto standards, was reasonable and definitely worth going to given the dearth of open businesses on New Year's Day.

If you're looking for a reliable evening out in the Queen Street West area, seemingly the Drake would be at the top of the list."}
{"text":"This is the ticket to yummy town people. Once you've been to their terrace upstairs at night and dined on their fried chicken and popcorn shrimp, your mind will be blown. The best in town, hands down. I am so stoked by their new menu and the staff are incredible. They also have a great wine list and make a mean mojito. Went there for my birthday and they gave us the royal treatment. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Darn. Darn. If this isn't the coolest place ever, I will eat my hipster shirt and call it a morning.

I know what you're looking for, and this isn't it. 

You wanted uniform rooms. 
Nope. 

You wanted a big lobby.
Nope.

You wanted hopelessly cool.
Nope... ooh, maybe. 

You wanted big rooms?
Ehh... let's go back to the cool thing.

If the Drake isn't your thing, well, it's not. And if this isn't the most useless review, you've never stayed at the Drake.

I've stayed in the finest hotels in some of the smarmiest countries in the world. 
None were the Drake. Not the countries, nor the hotels. Not even the smarmy.

Jury is out on the coolest hotel in the world. But if I were a betting person..."}
{"text":"Ok I understand what your saying, really 5 stars that's a little overboard but as someone who was born and raised in the hotel industry I can assure you this is a true 5 star worthy hotel, restaurant, bar, lounge and nightclub! 
I stayed at the drake over Halloween weekend and it was one of the best hotels I've seen let alone stayed in. The staff is amazingly polite, friendly and welcoming. It's as if they are reading your thoughts. The rooms are extremely unique and charming with several amenities that go above and beyond. The skin & hair care products are Malin + Goetz which are amazing plus ipod docks. Halloween weekend was defiantly the weekend to stay here because everyone was into it and the hotel was alive. The food is great I loved the drake burger and the brunch was the best ive had in Toronto the pancakes are delicious. The lounge was very fun on friday night as was the underground with great music plus cheap, well made drinks and outstanding service. 
The general store is truly a gem it has everything you didn't know you wanted and you get 10% if you stay there. All around the best hotel i have stayed at in toronto and a great place eat. drink. party. sleep. Will  defiantly be back."}
{"text":"A great place for a fun night out.  Went there to listen to a few bands in the underground as well as hung out in the lounge before for some cocktails.  The people were very friendly and pleasant.    I have even been there at odd times like 2pm in the afternoon for a drink and i've always been impressed with how clean and friendly the place is, very nice atmosphere and the story behind how the place was built is an amazing one to say the least!"}
{"text":"I had a constructive e-mail conversation with Jennifer, the senior manager of food and beverage.  She invited me back to a venue of my choice and to greet me in person.  However, I'm still shocked that servers are still acting inappropriately.  I just read another review posted Aug 28th that a server angrily plopped food in front of customers and shouted \"here!\" after a customer inquired when there food was arriving.  I also read on twitter that another customer had to send back their drinks twice and was served the wrong food.

Although I'm glad that Jennifer has taken the time to listen to my concerns I see that a lot of issues remain the same."}
{"text":"I've had a love affair with the Drake for a few years now. It's my favourite place for dinners and drinks and they have a great brunch. But I had there for dinner last night and I was blown away by a delicious meal.

We went for drinks and decided last minute to instead have dinner as we were both famished. Although there were many tempting dishes on the menu I decided to go with a simple fish & chips order accompanied by a pint of Blanche de Chambly. Being that I've had the real deal courtesy of the lovely Brits, my expectations were that it would be an okay attempt at a fish & chips. I was okay with this as I had a hankering for something fried.

I should have known that there would be nothing \"simple\" about it being that I was at of-course at The Drake. It was the best fish and chips I've had in my life, and that includes my fish & chips experiences in London, which until that very moment could not be touched by any North American attempt. 

The fish was lightly battered, so none of that more batter than fish nonsense. It was succulent, well-flavoured and delicious. The portion size was also quite generous. My friend was a little jealous, saying that he should have ordered the same, so I shared a little with him.

Also I love my potatoes and these chips were made from real potatoes - none of that frozen stuff. The sweet cold-slaw topped the meal off nicely and my pint of Blanche de Chambly was of-course tasty as expected.

Service was good, as the server was very helpful... as was the hostess who kindly accommodated our requests.  

I'll definitely be back for another serving!"}
{"text":"I think the hype that this place gets will always put people into a \"defensive\" review mode, just like any truly good place will. 

I went with some buddies about 2 weeks ago. They love building the line up at this place. As far as clubs go, they definitely subscribe to the old school style of promotion: let some beautiful people in, and build the line until people are just BEGGING to get in, so by the time they get past the lineup, the limos pulling up, the bouncers who are \"selectively\" picking people out the crowd and ushering in all the \"VIPs\", that will make all us poor lineup people SOOOO anxious to get in that we will give you ALLLLL of our cash.\"

its the drake. locals know what time it is. if the owners are smart they're probably siilent partners in a few local startup dive bars that MIGHT be big in a few years"}
{"text":"Brunch.

Best chicken and waffles in the city.  My husband and I get one plate of scones and one plate of waffles and we are stuffed.  The decor is awesome, especially if you have only been to the Drake at night, it is fun to see in the daylight."}
{"text":"The building is very old and the restaurant is so small. It's inconvenient for me to have the meal in such a narrow space. Ignore the price, the food is great! The servers are an unexpected view for me."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch. Hands down best chicken waffle! They don't take reservation if you have less than 4 people. But the wait is not too long if you walk in."}
{"text":"I've never stayed at the Drake Hotel, so I can't say much for their rooms (I hear they are all fancy and stuff). But as a local hang-out, it's pretty aiight. Usually some good bands are playing in the basement, the restaurant/bar can get pretty lively, and the Sky Bar patio has the cushiest of couches - it's the perfect Summer location for any planned get-together... and for making fun of drunken dressed up 30-something professionals who think they are living \"the life.\"  Seriously. They're redic."}
{"text":"I found a lot of drunken photos on my phone from last night at the Drake--guess it's a good place to party if I can't remember what was going on in any of them!  (I know this is a terrible review, view, because all I can really say is that I had fun.  But whatever, you should go to the Drake anyway.)"}
{"text":"Restaurant: 
Slightly overpriced and the items seem to try hard \"Buttermilk Chicken fingers - so original!\" but aren't quite there.  For the price you pay, I'd rather stroll up the street for a bite on Ossington. 
Main D-Floor:
Barely any room to dance around, but the music is so loud it's not likely you're here for the conversation.  Move the party downstairs to make the most of it. 
Downstairs:
Great Hip-Hop DJs and dancing. Where I spend most of my time at the bar."}
{"text":"Slow service. Bad tasting water. Overpriced food. Food poisoning. Won't be coming back. 
They get 2 stars only for atmosphere and also bc I was there during the Ocean Wise event."}
{"text":"I am confident that when Elvis wrote \"heartbreak hotel\" he was talking about this place. 
The atmosphere is douchy and sociopath-esque, any one who says otherwise is probably the same type of person who puts their socks on first when getting dressed: horrible."}
{"text":"This is a three-part review for: underground, the lounge and brunch.

Underground: Great space with some pretty cool acts. The only downside is that there is no cell phone reception. Good to know if you're meeting up with friends. Also good to know if you're the antsy type that is waiting for that cute boy/girl to call you back, and then freaks out when you realize that your phone has been offline for 3 hours. 

The lounge: is awesome because of the mix of people it brings in. Hipsters, wanna-be hipsters, the corporate crowd; the old, the young, the really young. It makes for some awkward interactions. I love awkward. 

Brunch: Decent place for comfort food the morning after. The fried chicken and waffles is a southern dish that I haven't seen elsewhere in Toronto. The only downside is, depending on how embarrassing the previous night was,  you might feel like Buckner walking back into Shea."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for brunch and I've enjoyed it every time.  Between the cool patio and the trendy lounge, it's a great spot to relax with friends. 

I tried their fried chicken with waffles and it was quite interesting.  I was picturing KFC style on waffles but got fried chicken laced with Indian spices.  Odd combo with the waffle but I was glad I tried it (the curiousity was killing me).  Eggs benny is pretty good served with nicely browned fries.  Tea is brewed as a loose leaf tea too!  

Service has always been friendly and very relaxed.  Servers usually strike up humourous conversations and pleasantries.  Overall, a great place to check out for brunch."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5! Good option for Sunday brunch with the girls. Enjoyed the eggs Benedict. Have some really fun drinks worth trying"}
{"text":"A few years ago the Drake Hotel used to be my favorite place to go, dance and drink the night away. That was during the days of \"More Proof\". Sadly, that DJ group exists no longer, and so for the most part so do my nights of partying at the Drake.

However, I love the Drake for the other things it offers. When I have more padding in my bank account I like to go here for brunch, dinner and maybe some causal drinks before the night owls head in. The coffee is great and the food is always tasty. 

I just wish they would get back some good DJ nights and eliminate the ridiculous cover just to sit down and have a beer."}
{"text":"I did not get the \"wow\" factor at the Drake. People go there to \"see and be seen\" so they hype it up and build expectations way too high. The decor was chic, the patio with heaters was a nice touch, and the music was decent. The crowd (since they were there to be seen), was dressed to impress. But... 

They charge $5 to get in - a usual practice for bars/ clubs but not a hotel. But OK. Once inside, they had a bouncer and a line to get up to the patio b/c of overcapacity. Get it. The wait was 5 mins, so whatever. Got up there, it looked  like Tonic at Murray Hill in NYC with some couches (read: average after work hang out).  Went back down, bouncer told us we would not be able to go back up because of the crowd. 

I've had better times at the Tribeca Grand or even the much hyped-up and overrated Gansevoort in NYC. Would I go back? Probably not unless dragged by my best friends."}
{"text":"Where do I start off? LOL

 This place is amazing. I love the weird decor just makes me stand out and makes me feel like home. I have had dinners, work gatherings, my own personal birthday dinner and party here. The staff members are very jolly and ensure that you have an amazing time. It all started off last year in 2011 I think Valentines?...maybe March break...my aunt and her friend came out for dinner here. We were in AWE with the exceptional service by the staff members and the great time we had with the live band that was performing at the time. 
    My second experience here was for a work dinner/gathering which we had a dinner in their up-scale meeting room on the second floor. The staff had already prepared our names on the tables and they were careful with our food-allergy as they knew a few of us had severe peanut allergies. The girl Melanie I believe gave us the starters and explained each of the items to us which made it even more fun as a lot of the items were new on their menu as they had changed their menu for the spring session. My birthday dinner in July 2011was phenomenal and every one had a great time! They offered me a dish on the house which I was very surprised by...no one does that now a days!....we had a group of people and everyone was welcomed to their seats. They brought out our food right away and didnt keep us waiting. The server was really funny....the manager came out to thank us for coming and showed us our way to the \"underground\".....we partied like maniacs there! The drinks were okay priced but the underground is extremely clean and the washrooms were spick and span!......
If you want a good date with your partner or want to go out for a little bit of fun or even just for a night out.......go to the drake hotel....im on my way tonight....."}
{"text":"Been there alot recently.  Saw the Submarines at Drake Underground http://www.flickr.com/photos/ourht/....but went there a few weeks ago during the maple syrup festival and had dinner.  Food is consistently awesome at the Drake no matter when you go.  Wine list is reasonable and is typically full of great choices (Ironstone!!!!! Yeah!!!!)   Service is great too... not in your face, not ignoring...though the server did give a slight look of disapproval when we ordered bottle number 3...weird...anyway...all in all in great.
I love the main floor bar area as well as upstairs...good people, reasonable prices and lotsa fun.  Im gonna go this weekend prob too...
Have fun if you go...!"}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch. I've been before to their trivia night and enjoyed the atmosphere. It was very crowded already at 12.30, so we had to wait around 25 mins. Reservations highly recommended. Or you can go to the Drake general store next door to take a look while you wait.

The server was very kind and told us a lot about the restaurant and the Drake brand. The food tasted amazing, but the service was a little slow, even when it wasn't very full by the time we left. I highly recommend the Drake breakfast (not sure if this is really the name) with homemade sausage (tasted amazing!) and taco breakfast (sounds weird but yummy as well!) We also ordered their specialty coffee, which was very good."}
{"text":"I go to the drake often on weekends and the bar staff are always fantastic and friendly. However when you want to sit down and order dinner the wait staff should be more attentive. I went to my first Wednesday night trivia yesterday and had so much fun! The sushi is always great and worth the expensive price (I love the grizzly feast). Overall this is a great spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"Today I went to the Sky Yard patio for some post-work drinks with friends  Ordered a pint of Stella.  By the time it came, it was warm.   Fine, whatever.  Given the bill for the table of 4.  Fine no problem, split the bill among the credit cards/cash whatever. She asked me what to punch into the machine, I said $17 which included tax and tip.  Then she complained our table under-tipped.  I said my tip for my part of the bill was included in the amount.  She said if I didn't use the tip option on the machine it didn't go to her, it went to the house. Fine, excuse my ignorance of your tip-out calculations.   Gave her an extra two dollars (I`d ordered two drinks).  This was generous considering I'm tipping twice for shitty service and warm beer.    

Went indoors and sat in the downstairs restaurant.  Friend ordered another pint of Stella.  Commented the beer was actually cold down here.  Great!  End of the night, my friends wanted to move to a booth 5 feet away.  The place was not busy.  Plenty of empty tables.  Downstairs Waitress said she couldn`t do it under our current tab.  Fine, we asked if  we could order some drinks on our current tab, settle up and finish our drinks there.  She said she`d feel bad because we`d be drinking at another waitress`s section without ordering anything. 

Not sure how the night ended, because I just left after that. The god-awful service was giving me a headache."}
{"text":"I just stayed in the suite at the Drake last night. I would have given it a higher rating if it weren't having an identity crisis. The room was lovely and the staff were accommodating.

I live on the east side of downtown Toronto and I booked the Drake as a treat for its convenient location near a number of venues where I celebrated by 30th birthday. I planned to have cocktails there with friends before dinner and host some night owls after the bars closed. The language on the Drake website invites these plans. My room is described as \"having ample room to enjoy a cocktail or two\". Another room caters to \"the kind of guest who only retreats to the bedroom once the party downstairs is over\" and advises the guest to bring ear plugs. 

Meanwhile, after booking, I was informed of a policy restricting guests of hotel patrons after midnight. And in actual fact, my guests and I were hassled about getting into the hotel even before midnight. We were informed by security in the most ironic way that \"this is not a party hotel\". At the time of those remarks, there was a sign near the door that read \"party\" and a line-up of party-goers out the door...

In any case, the real dilemma is this: if I and the other respectful (read: tame) professionals I hang out with cannot enjoy the space I've booked in the same unrestricted way as I enjoy my own adult apartment, then perhaps there is no reason for me to stay at the Drake. 

The Drake needs to decide. I'd recommend just going with the image that people already seek out. Embrace being a place to party and add complimentary ear plugs for all guests to the champagne and popcorn you already welcome people with.

I enjoyed my time a the Drake - I just resent being treated as if I'm living in a university dorm."}
{"text":"It really seemed like it was going to be 5-star here.  I loved the look and the ambiance, and the menu was very exciting.  All the food was competently prepared, and the service was good, but I just expected more.  The menu doesn't offer any exciting or unique options.  There was nothing to bring me back again."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Drake Hotel for the Jamaican Patty event hosted by Jamaica tourism.  The music and the vibe was popping and the place was full!  There was live music, and people talking, and the crowd was nice.  We waited in a very organized line to enjoy some patties, compliments of Allan patties in Scarborough.  I would like to return to the Drake on a regular night to get a sense for how it is when there isn't a special event on.  Overall, I enjoyed my visit and would go back again soon."}
{"text":"I'm obviously too cool for this place because the last time it was interesting was before the renovation. Yes this puts me in the minority because if you didn't know any better, the Drake looks like a cool place. The people are pretty and well dressed. There's a door man constantly letting people in from a second line you're not \"cool\" enough to know about and the drinks are just expensive enough for the same things they serve everywhere else that you'll wonder if you're just paying the \"f-you\" tax on top of the standard import pricing.

I get suckered into coming here about once a year by friends from out of town. They've heard it's great or have been before and love the atmosphere. In either case I generally spend all my time people watching and wondering why anyone would like this place.

On my last trip here the cream of the intellectual crop were hypothesizing that their friend was so great at vomiting because he does it all the time. That was shortly topped by a 5'0\" tall man suffering from a little big man complex making a big show of tipping the door man for letting him in...because he was at the front of the line anyway.

If you're looking for a place where you'll hear the words \"bro\", \"guy\", \"sick\" and \"dude\" all in the same sentence but you're to shy (or old) to hang out in a high school parking lot then this is your place. You can stump the crowd with your cunning ability to use acronyms like dtf because we haven't all known what that meant since grade school.

If you were to remove all the obnoxious people the room would be empty and you'd just have an ok bar at that point. Bar service is alright but nothing spectacular. Drink selection is pretty standard and the food is okay.

Mark this down in the \"Tell us what you really think.\" category."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for brunch to celebrate my birthday.  We got there around 1pm and there were no line ups and were quickly seated.  Also, they were willing to seat me even though my husband wasn't with me yet as he was parking the car which I was quite pleased about. 

We ordered: 
1) Mushrooms Eggs Benny - This was absolutely delicious.  By far, the best eggs benny I've had in Toronto to date.  It sat atop a delicious biscuit which held up to the yolk and hollandaise sauce and didn't get all soggy like at some other places I've tried.  The poached egg was cooked perfectly and paired so well with the sauteed mushrooms.  It also came with roasted root vegetables.  Personally I'd probably prefer just potatoes but didn't mind having the combination of carrots and parsnips in there.  

2) Chicken & Waffle 
My husband ordered this and the chicken was so moist and juicy with great crispy skin.  The waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  It came with cooked cherries as well and typically I hate cooked fruit but the cherries actually worked really well with the whole dish. 

I was perfectly satiated by the end of the meal but my husband felt he could have had a bit more.  The price was on par with other brunch places in Toronto.  My husband is a pretty hard person to impress in regards to food and we both felt this was by far the best brunch we've had in Toronto by a long shot."}
{"text":"Only went here for a concert, saw The Submarines with Headlights opening for them. Very good, more dance-floor than seating :-)

Bar service was excellent with the bartenders recommending a few different types of drinks when I was feeling adventurous. Price wasn't bad, tickets were $12, drink prices were normal, maybe a few dollars more than usual, small price to pay for a comfy venue.

No idea if there's a coat-check, it was the spring when I went and I had no need for a jacket."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly staff, super cool location and good prices. Crazy spicy hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Went to The Drake Hotel restaurant last night with the girlfriend to try their Winterlicious menu.  We were really disappointed with the food as both of us had high hopes for this trendy Queen West hangout.  

Service was average and the ambiance was below average as we were seated in the \"skyyard\" which is up top near the rooftop patio.  Tables were very close together and very little privacy. 

We had the $35 winterlicious dinner and a glass of red wine each.  Total was just under $100 plus tip.  We both had the vegi hand roll app which was decent.  Main course I ordered the half chicken dinner and my GF had the cauliflower truffle risotto.  The chicken was actually pretty good (cooked nicely with a tasty gravy) I would give it a 7/10.  My GF's risotto dish was terrible and maybe the worst risotto either of us have ever eaten - 1/10.  It was like regular white rice in a cream sauce.  Very bland and disappointing.  The desserts (Banana chocolate cake and burnt caramel custard) were also quite bland.  The custard was more of a jello type structure and not at all what I would consider a \"custard\".  

Overall I felt like the value just wasn't there for the money we spent.  Also, the winterlicious promo price of $35 doesn't seem to be that big of a discount from their regular menu pricing.  Our entrees were priced $19 and $22 on the regular menu so the value of the winterlicious offering is questionable to say the least. 

Definitely won't be returning here for dinner as there are so many other places in Toronto where $120 can buy a couple a gourmet dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for the new year eve celebration and had an absolutely negative experience regarding food and service. We had the five course meal with 9pm seating and had high expectations. Food was brought late and the main meal was a bit cold. We had our main course after midnight which was unacceptable. The Oysters were terrible. Portions were small. The only thing acceptable was the presentation. There was no bread on the table and we had to almost negotiate getting a bread. Foie Grass was disgusting. Duck Pate tasted very strong and was left untouched.
Dessert was bitter and overall it just wasn't worth the $164 price tag. And service was severely slow. Won't come back or recommend this place to anyone. The music was old and garbage. Also crowd got a bit weird by the end of the night."}
{"text":"Best descriptor of the Drake: paltry.

I really don't appreciate paying cover to enter such a noisy sleepy lounge with inferior drinks and guys who look as though they've just stepped out of their phd programs and decided to go to the Drake because they once caught wind that it is the place to be. Please stop bumping into me, and no, I really don't want to dance."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove from West Chicago, IL to Toronto for our Honeymoon. We wanted to stay in a unique place thad had a lot of style. My Wife found The Drake Hotel online and booked it on the spot. Once we finally made it there, I knew immediately that I was going to like this place by the vintage/stylish decor mixed with the modern graphics and classic furniture. It was as though the place was built exactly for me. The service was exceptional! Jon at the front desk was a fantastic help checking in along with Jonathan who was a rockstar at checking us out and getting us back on the road as quickly as possible. 

The rooms are hot mix of artsy and modern style (with a kick of kinky thrown in). The lounge that is connected to the lobby was littered with vintage lighting, great music and a fun crowd. Service was very professional and dressed to match the atmosphere. I really cant say enough about how great this place is and how well they treated my wife and I."}
{"text":"Met friends there last night for drinks and dancing on the main floor. The staff were pros and pretty cool, but the crowd was ify. Tons of douchy dudes that need to start fights, shove people out of the way and generally ruin everyone's fun before heading back to wherever they are from (I bet I can guess the area code). I even witnessed two girls scrap it out in the lobby. Lame people aside, it's a decent party scene. I would stick to the top patio though, more mature crowd with less drama."}
{"text":"Pros:
- my waiter was really nice
- the servers were friendly (and cute!)
- music selection was great for supper

Cons:
- the other waiters I could see were rather rude when seating patrons
- the patio is designed poorly. too many tables in such a small space. I could see others feeling awkward sitting that close to a separate group.
- I ordered the burger and fries. For $18, I expected something much more delicious and a lot less 'picnic'. And it was tiny! Seriously, the burger itself was so bland I had to put ketchup on it to give it some taste and moisture. Could have had the same burger at Burger King.
- Also got the virgin raspberry mint lemonade which was way too sweet..and $7 for a virgin drink?! This place should really be at three dollar signs rather than two. 

Just an unfortunate experience that took away from my wallet but left me hungry."}
{"text":"Visited last night for dinner.  The rooftop patio is nice and staff are very attentive. Washrooms by patio were clean and well stocked.  

As a value proposition though you can do much better.  For example , we ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken for $24.  At that price do you get a side? Heck no, not even fries. Just a piece of chicken no better and no worse than Nando's.  Very surprising omission.  

I had the fish and chips for $24.  Again just one piece of fish at least it came with a generous portion of both coleslaw and tasty fries.  I would've preferred more fish and less of the cheap stuff though for that price.  

Food quality was fine but definitely felt like we were paying for the atmosphere and not much else.  Would not return for food."}
{"text":"Frequently in moments of quiet, my mind wanders off and I start thinking about the Drake Hotel's chicken and waffles. Crispy, golden waffles that are fluffy on the inside and with perfectly fried chicken thighs on top; I daydream about them morning, day, and night, thinking about when the next time I can have them is. 

The Drake Hotel is my go to spot for brunch in Toronto. It's always rather calm and relaxed on a weekday morning, the perfect atmosphere for catching up with a friend while you both play hooky. The service is always friendly and I find I never have to wait too long for a table. While I do consider their chicken and waffles my number one fave, the Drake Breakfast is a classic that you can't go wrong with. 

When in doubt and looking for a place to brunch, The Drake Hotel is the place to be."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect from Toronto. I've only visited western Canada and never had any reason to visit what is arguably the most diverse city in all of North America. My friend made reservations for us at the Drake Hotel on Queen Street, a hip, up and coming section of Toronto with great restaurants and funky shops. Arriving at the Drake reminded me of the small boutique hotels of South Beach. Very hip, good looking people checking us in, elegant and romantic black and white photographs on the walls and modern designs with hidden lighting greeted us. 
Our room was small, but didn't feel too cramped. The bed, shower, toilet, sink were all there with no real doors separating anything. There was a frosted sliding glass door that moved to cover the toilet then moved to cover the clear glass of the shower next to it. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were nice and soft. The down comforter was nice but the baby alpaca blanket was the best addition. 
The Drake also houses a restaurant/bar with expensive drinks and wonderful food but all well worth it. You won't find your typical drinks here so paying $10 for a ginger margarita wasn't unexpected. In the morning, there is a coffee shop with brunch options. Make reservations the day before because this place gets packed and the wait can be well over an hour. We didn't eat but it all looked amazing. 
To top it off, the Drake has the \"Underground.\" A music venue that brings in top acts in a small space. 
I can't say enough about how nice the staff were here. When our computer didn't work, they offered us many solutions, including the use of their laptop to take up to our room. 
The prices weren't all that bad either for such a hip place. $129 was their special rate and this was for New Years. I found that was very affordable especially in the area of town it was in. 
It was a wonderful stay and I can't wait to go back. But not in the winter. It's a very cold place Toronto."}
{"text":"Great patio on a summer day. Well decorated and comfortable but that's about it! Food was terrible and service took forever. We wait 30 min for bread and had to ask three times. They are known for their cocktails but those were overrated and overpriced.
Please do not order food there! It was subpar for what you are paying."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken and waffles. It was fantastic. Great service and atmosphere, will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this hotel. The rooms are fairly small, minimal and comfortable. It feels more sustainable than most hotels, toiletries in large pump bottles, no refrigerator etc... The staff are really friendly and helpful. It took is a little time to understand the hostess rules for the restaurants, but once we got it it was all ok. This will be the only hotel I recommend in Toronto going forward. Ps. I love the location, it's out of the city in a very cool arty area. Easy to get to on the trams."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Toronto--it's the place to stay. Within walking distance or train of anywhere worth visiting. Small, comfortable and intimate. The restaurant and the attendants are all tops! One drawback, I paid for a parking space and someone took it. Then I received a parking ticket for where I had to park. But, the manager was nice enough to take care of it. Loved the little outdoor breakfast area. Thank you for a lovely stay! I hope to see you again."}
{"text":"Came for a birthday brunch with some of my fave ladies. 

It's a cute spot. Friendly servers. There's a guy playing the guitar by the fireplace. We were there for over 2 hours, drinking our coffees and catching up. I appreciated that no one seemed to mind at all...

Had the breakfast burrito (if a burrito is an option, I'm likely to order it). It was good, just served with a side of sour cream and salsa. Best surprise - the roasted potatoes were IN the burrito. Thanks Drake!"}
{"text":"Food tasty.  And occasionally the servers are terrific.  But there persists here a strange, unaccountable carelessness and rudeness for customers.  Staff who dismiss complaints, staff who lack etiquette.  Have been here many times and am convinced the place is rankly ageist.  If you're over fifty and you want to have a nice peaceful breakfast this SHOULD be the place to go, BUT IT ISN'T."}
{"text":"The Drake is the place to go to get good, decent price food in Toronto as well as being in a hip and fun atmosphere. Despite the fact that it's known as an 'it' place in the city, I've always found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I often walk by later in the evening when there are huge lineups outside and that's not the scene I'm into, but when that's not happening it's a good place. 
I like the outside patio too. Good for a summers eve, if you can get a seat."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  We Made reservations  (on line) and told them  that it was my B-day and  asked if we can get a nicer table. The young hostes (not sure of her name had a light accent) placed at the back of the restaurant  dark and boring area far from window and main area of restaurant  and right beside other couple, could heard their full conversation.  Not sure why hostes done this when most of the table  around us we we  completely empty with reservation sign on them.
Thanks for her bad decision this is our first and last time at Drake. I have to say that food was good.
..was there Feb 20 at 6:45pm"}
{"text":"Cool vibe; a landmark in the area.  None of the food is excellent, though solid and consistent.  Enjoyed trivia night.  Restaurant has a nice large patio in the summer which is great for weekend brunches."}
{"text":"This hotel reminded me of the Hoxton hotel in London. I love the use of space for the rooms, which are very clean. I would stay here again."}
{"text":"Nice space....sky bar especially. Brunch is OK on the weekends, sitting out on the patio. It's overpriced though. The real problem here is the people who go there in droves. It's \"popular\" to the \"905\" crowd.

The Buck 65 shows there recently have been especially fun.

My advice is go when you'd expect it to be dead.

{"text":"Wasn't sure where to post this as we were going to the Drake Underground for a show but ultimately, the Underground was not what made this a bad experience. 

Went to the Drake for a comedy show at the Underground. First, the show was billed as starting at 8pm. When we got there we were told the doors open at 8 and the show probably started around 8:45. Not a big deal. 

We (a party of 4) got there at 7:40 and were told we'd have to wait. One of the four 'hostesses' said we'd have to wait at the bar (standing only) even though the restaurant was at about 25% capacity and there were plenty of tables we could have sat at during our 20 minute wait. 

At the bar we were told we could go upstairs and sit down (Sky Yard?). Once up there we were told we'd have to go downstairs to order our drinks (back to the bar). They finally decided to seat us once we went back. I was already standing at the bar and the two bartenders weren't doing anything so I tried to order my drink (just a beer) and was told to go to my table and order from my waitress. 5 minutes later the waitress finally came around (keep in mind the place was not busy). It took over 10 minutes for my beer to arrive after that I did have 3 beers come to me at one point but the waitress had obviously gone to the wrong table and brought me someone else's order). At this point the doors for the show had already opened (we were told we could bring our drinks down) by the time we finally were able to get our bill and pay we got to the show late and manage to get the last seats in the place, a few more minutes later and those seats would have been gone - even though we arrived 20 minutes early. 

Was not impressed by the unorganized staff and awkward way we were handled. Should have just been told to come back at 8 instead of being moved around like that. 

Other than that the restaurant/bar has a great atmosphere, drinks were cheap-ish. The staff was friendly even though we were just being moved around like a flock of sheep. 

Would I go to the restaurant/bar after this - perhaps during the summer to check out the terrace on the second floor. It was the first time going there so I now know that if I'm going for a show, go somewhere else first for a drink and show up right on the dot."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place. Be sure to order a mimosa during their wknd brunch and to make resos in advance. Pancakes were awesome."}
{"text":"I remember when the Drake opened, it was a cool addition to the neighborhood and indeed a place the neighborhood could hang out at - always trying something new in the kitchen and cafe, always different acts going and you'd see people from the neighborhood.

Alas on a Friday night with some friends in from out of town we go to have a drink in the 'hood and go to the Drake, we were met with several bouncers and a $10 per person cover. No band, no act. All we wanted was a drink, but to get in to what's become the 'hip' domain of 905'ers or losers that would pay $10 to hang out with other losers that would pay $10 is a sign the Drake has lost it's way - or maybe it's just making more money now. Can't slight them for that.

But for a review - take your $10 and instead of spending to get to a place that is not worth $10 to have a drink in, and spend it on booze at any one of the other bars along Queen or Ossington. We certainly weren't looking ne'er do well'ish, and i doubt we had 905 tattooed on our foreheads so the notion of a cover just to have a drink was total BS. That the goons at the doors may play favorites or dissuade some people from coming in is, well, like the club district maybe, but not west queen west.

if you think you're in for a significantly better time at the Drake because there's cover you'll be disappointed. If you wanna meet people dumb as you to pay to go in to bar to have a drink - pay the cover :)


Queen west rocks, the party is always where you go, not the bar. That they charge to drink their overpriced drinks is really a test of the dumb or desperate."}
{"text":"We went there with our over the top stylist on Sunday afternoon.  We had the 3 course winterlude lunch feature which was very good and we shared a bit if everything. We had beet salad, Cesar sald and a white pea and vegetable soup to start; I had the baked sole with a raisin cilantro topping...nice, the braised chicken and the fancy baked macaroni and cheese with broccoli were amazing; flank steak wad good too.  For dessert, the apple strudel was the best; peanut butter and jam on raisin cristin w aged cheddar was so so and overhyped on the menu.
This place is known for toronto's best blueberry scones and it sure lives up to its reputation; comes in a sharing plate w raspberries, jam, butter and cream ooof!!!
All and all the ambiance and good food made for a great planning meeting; we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The best brunch in the city! Make sure you order the chicken and waffles because it is delicious! I also loved the Shakshuka! The sauce had a bit of kick - it was delicious! They do a fantastic Americano The place is baby friendly but it's busy! It can take long to get a high chair so bring a travel  one just in case. And make a reservation a week in advance because the place gets booked!  We have been twice in the last few months and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Funky place to go. The music is not for everyone, but the cool thing is that an actual club starts working downstairs around 10:30. So you can come get your drinks on and then go the club. If you are tired - try renting a room."}
{"text":"Don't want massive line ups for weekend brunch? The Drake takes reservations! This is a huge plus for someone like me who hate long lineups when HANGRY!

I've been here several times, and some of my favorites are the Drake Benny (with smokes salmon) and their chicken & waffles. Portion sizes are small for the price, but the taste justifies everything!

Service is pretty spotty. Sometimes we get the friendliest server, and when we get seated by the coffee bar, the staff there are generally more stressed and short with customers. There was a stain on my napkin and when he brought the cutlery, he clearly saw the stain and flips the napkin over before laying down the cutlery.. that was disappointing. I ended up just requesting a new napkin.

The Drake also have events like Trivia Night that attracts large crowds, but it's always a fun time!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about the late night scene at the Drake and I just had to check it out myself on a Saturday night. Unfortunately we didn't get to try the food here so this review is purely based off the drinks and late night scene. We got at the Drake around 10:50 which is pretty early for any spot you're going to for a night out. However, we were recommended to be there early to avoid a long wait time to get in. 

When we got there, the line was considerably long but luckily it was moving hence, the wait wasn't long. Unfortunately, for our friends that decided to show up at 11:20 PM, they had to wait almost an hour just to get in. Cover is $10 per person which is pretty standard for most Toronto places, but being from a university town I wish it was cheaper. Coat check is another $3 each as well but line for it took a while. There were just way too many people budding into the coat check line and security wasn't really controlling the line.

The Drake is basically divided into the top floor and the basement. The music is great in both areas but I was definitely a bigger fan of the music upstairs. It was one our buddy's birthday but Drake doesn't really do bottles so we were forced to get drinks individually. What surprised me was the difference in pricing for drinks between the top floor and the basement. Unfortunately in the basement, they don't do singles and only do doubles so you end up paying an arm and a leg for drinks ($15 per drink). Upstairs, the drinks are decent but still expensive at $7.50 per drink. If you're going to just drink beer all night, you're in luck because you won't have a hole in your wallet. 

Honestly, I would go back for the music and the crowd but I really wish the drink menu was way cheaper. It's just not an affordable option for a regular night out."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to share this gem in a city where going to most great places and events involves a line-up and overpriced fare but The Drake hosts a great FREE event every Monday called 86'd.  You'll get to enjoy some free food and sometimes alcohol as local chefs and baristas go head-to-head in small, albeit friendly, competitions. Maybe it'll be a corn on the cob night with a variety of bespoke butters. Guacamole showdown, Ole!  Boozy root beer floats with local ice cream, sorry ya missed this one.  Anyways, an awesome unknown event now being shared with all of you.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friends were quite surprised when I told them I have never been to Drake hotel. I even thought this had something to do w Drake, the rapper, and obviously I was later corrected.

We booked a table for two for dinner on a Friday night at 7. Parking was available on the street w/o much walking. Without much wait, we got seated by the window. The tables were put pretty close to each other. It felt crowded sitting down especially with no offer of hanging our jackets. Also, the design of the table legs made it hard to get in and out. It makes you feel so clumsy. 

The food: menu is full of selections. From regular bar food to seafood, sushi, dumplings, steak, ribs.. Etc which makes Drake hotel able to cater to different crowds. Based on other Yelp reviews, I ordered duck wings $17, and fried chicken thigh $6.

Duck wings were pretty big in size, and very tender, plus moist. I am used to the Asian way of roasted duck but drake makes it less oily and light. Loved how they paired it w deep fried crispy shallot. 

Fried chick thigh did not disappoint either although portion is small. Well it was only $6. Maybe it was just too good that I wish they could serve more. It was very well fried on the outside and when you bit on it, it sort of felt like dissolving in your mouth w the right amount of fat. So moist so tender and flavorful. It was served very hot, another reason why it tasted so good I guess.

I think almost everyone told me their cocktails are very on point. Ordered \"paper plane\" $14, 2.25oz. It was pretty good. Different layers of flavor going on in one tiny little glass of bourbon. One little sip, I tasted refreshing lemon juice while it ended w a tad of bitterness after taste, in a good way. Like it, but price didn't justify it for this tiny amount. Maybe not next time but still a good experience.

After getting our bill, we proceeded to the upstairs outdoor patio which was known for a must-see at drake hotel. Even tho it's freezing outside, they sheltered this patio with plastic cover and put enough heat surrounding you. They put up lights around the patio. Pretty romantic. I must say this is a very good spot for holding a party. 2 secluded areas here perfect for a party size of maybe 15-20 people each area. As a matter of fact, tonight there was no place for us to sit down other than standing at the bar. Same drink menu as downstairs and I wasn't down for another $14 pricey tiny cocktail. So I left after a glass of bar rail and made note to myself I'll probably host my next birthday bash here.

Overall I would give 3.5 
Food was really good
Service ok
Trendy decor but I felt kinda clumsy and packed
Round it up to 4, cos I think it deserves at least a visit here to check it out. Check out my pictures ;)"}
{"text":"Super hip hotel and restaurant on West Queen West. I've never stayed at the hotel but love the restaurant there. They have a really cool rooftop patio and a large indoor restaurant as well. I've had many things from the menu and haven't been disappointed yet. The sushi is really good and the cocktails are top notch. It's a little pricey but I've generally found it to be worth the cool ambience, good food and drinks."}

{"text":"Very interesting and eclectic food. I went for dinner and was quite disappointed with the portion size. I had a seafood dish for $28 and received 2 shrimp and 4 calamari rings. Seriously? Not impressed. The lobster nachos was probably the best dish we had. I probably will give it another shot and return for their brunch. However I would not return for their dinner; quite the ripoff. Service however, was great."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and had brunch. It over all was very good. The home fries were delicious! I don't know if it's because it's my weak spot, or if they were just that good, but I couldn't stop eating it. Love that they were made with carrots and potatoes, I felt a little bit better about eating so much. Chicken and waffles were also really good. I'm not a fan of waffles in general and there was about 1/2 ton of cream on top, but the chicken was perfect. It was crispy on the outside, easy to cut through, and so, so, so moist on the inside. The chicken was some of the best I've had with chicken & waffles. Smoke salmon eggs Benny were good, but there was something a bit off about it to me. The hollandaise seemed a bit sour to me for whatever reason...

I wish service was a bit better. It felt like the most difficult thing to make eye contact with our waitress behind the register. More often than her coming to check in on us it felt like we had to flag her down. 


Overall good food, needs better service"}
{"text":"Oh my god sooo amazing I'm glad I didn't go with my safe option of the drake breakfast and decided to go get the chicken waffles instead such an abundance of flavours that I wish I could describe but you will have to go try yourself. It was the perfect combination to make you realize that being single doesn't suck when you have food options like this. Eat your heart out lonely single person ! Winter is here and you need those extra founds ! I wish I could say any of the other two people had anything different but only one person did. He got the sweet potato toast which consisted of sweet potato mash on toast with poached egg and hollandaise sauce as he upped it to a Benny  and although the portion looked small compared to our waffles due to the richness of the flavours he said it was filing. The waffles were so filling to be honest and we cleared our plates out of gluttony and not wanting to waste a dime no because we weren't full. The syrupy goodness and the textures of the fried chicken and fluffy waffles and tart berries will keep me waiting for the next time to go. Also the Americano was pretty good and the other two parties had a soy chai and an almond chai that looked divine. The drakes interior and electric group of patrons will keep your eyes busy. A nice mix of hipsters and grungy chaps as well as botoxed babes and women who try too hard to look young and hip again. The window seats we had by the street were amazing and bright. The server was so nice I think his name was Tyler and patient with us. We didn't feel rushed he was super chatty and even gave us a lesson on how almond milk is made lol. Worth mentioning brunch is served until 4pm."}

We ordered the chicken and waffles and in one word, it looked and tasted disgusting. Deep fried chicken breast, over a deep fried or panfried waffle that was soaking in some syrup with cream and cranberries on top. Yuck. My friend liked it though.

She also ordered some scones which looked old and dry (at least 1 day old), and did not look appetizing at all. I only ate the fruit on the plate, but left the rest to her.

I had the poached eggs over toast and the fries looked brown, old and disgusting (am pretty sure they were day-old fries). The poached eggs were done pretty well, but the hollandaise sauce (although not broken), looked flavourless (I took a little taste and it WAS flavourless).

Overall, I think an egg mcmuffin @ McDonald's would have been cheaper and tastier than what we got. Sorry.

Update: I will say that management is at least on their toes. Not long after this review (which I do think shows them in a very bad light), they emailed me asking for more information about why I felt this way, etc. 

I still stand by my review because what I ate was simply disgusting and not what I'd ever eat again, but I do love that they take the time to read and care about what people are saying about them. 

Thumbs up for management initiative!"}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch. They have a more casual vibe during the day, which I prefer. Reservations are a must, and you're more likely to get a comfy booth with one.

The most recent time we went was St. Patrick's day, and they had an additional menu for the occasion. I decided to get the smoked brisket and roast potato hash from the special menu, and it was so good. The Art House ale mushrooms were probably my favourite part of the dish, and I wish they'd put a bigger mound of them on my plate. The brisket was perfectly smoked, if a bit on the salty side, but I am a bit sensitive to salt so I'm letting it slide.

Aside from the great food and drinks, the decor is quite interesting. Especially the naked man's back above the stairwell. After all these years of going here, he's starting to feel like an old friend. I don't know what I would do if they ever got rid of him."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for breakfast and it was quite good. The vibe and decor both are great. 

They servers do a great job in serving and their breakfast menu isn't bad at all! I had their Chicken and Waffle and I have to say it was quite good and filling. There is a Green P closed by and the bus from subway drops you near the place as well."}
{"text":"I went to the Drake hotel for the first time on Saturday night for a friend's birthday party. We had dinner reservations for 7:30 and stayed until about 1:30-2am. I'd say it's a pretty cool and interesting concept! Loved the atmosphere and decor! They having a dining area (where we ate) which turns into a dance floor around 11pm, they have a \"drake underground\" that's located downstairs which is another dancing area with a bar (this is where we stayed after dinner) and there's a patio upstairs but didn't go to. They played a mix of hip hop, r&b, reggae, some house and of course Drake! I think the DJ could've mixed a little better but overall we had a great time and killed the dance floor!

For dinner I noticed right away how expensive everything was! My fiance and I both ended up ordering the burger with fries, it was pretty good but not the best...don't think it was worth $19 (I don't think any burger should cost that much). We also ordered two drinks: I got gin & ginger, he got a beer. Our bill came up to about $65. Shortly after we awkwardly got kicked out of the dining area because the area we were sitting in turned into the VIP section. It got busy fairly quickly. If you get downstairs early enough, there are tables that you can sit at and leave your coats, it will save you the $3 coat check!

We had a good time but wasn't as great as I expected it to be and prices were a little too much. I would go back if it was for another birthday party or special event but wouldn't go out of my way to go there on a regular night out."}
{"text":"I've been having the drake brunch for years - always getting the same eggs Benedict. You have recently changed it ( which you have done a few times before) removing the side of potatoes and just plopping the eggs on top of a salad. I don't mind paying $20 for breakfast - but I would like to see a bit more effort on the plate."}
{"text":"*Review for Rooftop Patio/bar only*

I have always wanted to try the Drake Hotel - specifically, its patio for drinks. My bf and I had to go to 99 Sudbury for a birthday party, but we were three hours earlier! How to kill time...

We walked onto Queen Street, and I noticed the Drake. Then I noticed the patio and so we quickly entered. The hotel is odd. As soon as you walk in the front entrance, you are greeted by two hostesses...as if you are walking into a restaurant. We asked if we could sit at the patio and we were led upstairs. What a different vibe! We could hear lounge/disco music blasting away. 

We asked for the sunniest table, which happened to be near smoker's row. We just wanted drinks so I had a glass of Pinot, and my bf had the Ceasar. We also shared scones which were okay. This ain't high tea so don't expect anything fancy.

Is it just me, but I found this place to be a tad bit expensive! The total bill for two drinks and scones came out to be $40 and change...without tips! The price to pay for drinking...

Glad I tried this place out, but probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is actually a review on the Drake Hotel burger. I think it deserves mention so I'm uploading a photo and putting a raving write-up on it.  

Here are some highlights:
-they ask how you want your burger done (I find this rare these days)
-sides are great (fries and coleslaw well prepared)
-ambiance and location are good (nearby parking, great crowd)

In a nutshell, a burger meal done right."}
{"text":"A colleague and I went for lunch here yesterday and were met with a super hipster interior. Now that's not a bad thing - I LOVED it. Between the light fixtures/sculptures being made of bike parts to the faux marble tables and the witty condiments holder, I am a fan of the decor.

I kept changing my mind on what I wanted (chicken and waffles? Zucchini spaghetti? salad?) but ended up getting the Panzanella Salad. I love arugula which is what ultimately sold me. The watermelon and the tomato vinaigrette were very odd at first, but I loved it by the end. It's a very filling salad with a lot of savory deliciousness to it. The focaccia is a great touch and helped it stick to my ribs a lot better. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Drake on our honeymoon the beginning of October '14. I picked this place based on its eclectic style and because people have high regards about the attached restaurant and the live venue.

The hotel is really lovely and they gave us complimentary bubbly since we were in town on our honeymoon. That was super sweet! It was the most interesting decor we've ever experienced and thoroughly loved the art filled, euro-style suite and its amenities. Though, we were a bit sticker-shocked at the cost of the in-room goodies and available souvenirs so we just took pictures of the stuff and left it all in-house. 

We never ventured to the Drake's restaurant on account of the abundance of food in the city. I swear Toronto has got to be the place for foodies. It's possible we both outgrew our waistband in the few days spent there. The variety of cuisine  was completely impressive, yet the selections of beer were lackluster at best. We're from Detroit where we have a plethora of micro brews to choose from so I guess it's okay that Toronto didn't shine much in that regard. No biggie. 

The live venue in the basement of the Drake really was nothing more than a club full of obnoxious 19 - 25 year olds . Two words: Hated it. My husband and I are VERY open minded when it comes to music. We go to live venues of all different genres frequently in Detroit and find very little fault with even the smallest and dirtiest of places. This place, however, was just not our cup of tea. During our visit, we chose not to partake in the raves and resorted to the local pubs instead. It's a shame since part of what we paid for was the convenience of food and entertainment. Oh well. 

We elected to stay at the Drake because we figured they would swoon us but that didn't happen. It's a great place--just not for us. If you're into the club scene it's great. If you're not, I don't recommend it. 

That's why I chose \"Meh\" instead of \"A-OK\" here."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today for the first time with my friends. We sat on the patio upstairs. Aesthetically, the space is very pleasing and well decorated. The area is well spread out so it's breathable even at full capacity. 

I ordered the eggs benny ($16) which comes with 2 eggs with ham, mushroom or salmon is $3 extra. Also comes with an arugula salad. The portion is good for one person but a little over priced. I love eggs Benedict and this was just OK.  The hollaindaise sauce could use more flavour. I prefer the egg benny from Eggspectation located near the Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"The Drake Hotel started it all making West Queen West near Parkdale THE cool area to be. The renovation of this old Hotel is amazing. The rooftop patio is cool with good weather. More heaters are needed often. The brunch is delicious. Inside, the restaurant is very good food, but waiting may not be worth it. The Raw Bar is amazing though the sushi has been downsized of late. Still some of the best in town. The drinks change with the seasons, but are also interesting. Great DJ's, great atmostphere. The place for yuppie, hipster, young and old."}
{"text":"Whoa.  We have been Draking it as a group for the last couple of years.  

Style all of its own; mid century simplicity, eclectic freaky-styley, sexy as hell.

Leaving the patio, the rooms, restaurants, clubs, shops and incredibly personable staff makes the drive home a little less joyful."}
{"text":"So as promised to myself I went here on a Saturday night and was pleasantly surprised by how much of a merry time I had.

Although I did not expect to have to pay a $10 cover for what is just in my eyes a fancy pub. Fancy because it has books and retro back wall and a few nice staircases but for queen street west I think $5 is fair. 

Line up for the patio upstairs which was a bit silly as when I did make it up there it was not exactly packed. However again I must say I do like their patio its a great place to chill in a group.

Downstairs was a mix and match crowd, not hippsterville which is what I thought it would be but  a fun normal crowd, totally the opposite of where I had come from earlier in the night.

Will probably be making this a regular haunt for when I am bored shitless at home and want some fun drinks."}
{"text":"Just had the fried chicken waffle dish. Probably really unhealthy but amazingly tasty.
Worth it!
The scene at the drake is always cool."}
{"text":"After long last, I tried the Drake again over the weekend. 

We had fabulous service, it was a great atmosphere, and the Burger was unreal. 

Well played, Drake Hotel."}
{"text":"Solid 3.

Loved the decor, sweet waitress and no problem getting coffee/water refills, but the food was slow, lukewarm, and just okay. Not at all bad, but by no means great.

Not anything I'd be quick to recommend, as beautiful as the place is."}
{"text":"Loved the cocktails - had the \"gin gin mule\" and the \"sympathy for the devil\". The service was a little slow even though the restaurant was not packed, but I still gave it 5 stars for the quality of the food. I ordered the duck and it was cooked to perfection. Loved it and would come back for more if I was a permanent resident (on travel)"}
{"text":"This everything you could want: people, service, menu, location, MOCKTAILS!

The menu is fantastic.  Many wonderful options.  Myself and two co workers had amazing meals.  I recommend the crispy pork belly.  As a twelve stepper I appreciate the menu of mocktails.  So few places offer such options.  The people watching was fantastic.  Our server was great, the neighborhood was fun.  I loved the architecture of the place.  Next time we may hang out longer and learn its history."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stayed at Drake Hotel for our anniversary for 
one night. It was a very nice surprise, as I always wanted to check out The Drake and she booked the \"art passport package\". We both thought that this included an art tour or something..but it includes 1 bottle of wine and a postcard print of a local artist piece in your room. The room had style which is the only reason I am giving 2 stars. 

When we arrived, the receptionist said they would call to confirm our reservation for dinner. We never got a call and mind you we had this booked weeks in advance so waiting for a table for another 30 minutes was annoying. When seated for our meal, we got wedged in a small side table close to the kitchen. The service was awful and the food just okay. The set up of the dining room is small and uncomfortable. We also got charged twice for the stay and incorrectly for the meal. 

My final opinion don't waste your money here when you can go up the street to the Gladstone."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch. Started off with a grapefruit mimosa. Yummy! As I always do with any new place I asked what the bartender recommended on the menu.  The advice was the bennys or the southern fried chicken and waffles. I'm into rancheros right now so decide to go with the Drake rancheros and chicken and waffles. 

Wow the fried chicken was cooked to perfection - super crispy skin with tender juicy meat.  I was very impressed with the waffle too. What I didn't really like was the syrup or creme fraiche. There was so much syrup that I suggest ordering it on the side. The creme fraiche did nothing for me. 

I would say this is one of the worst rancheros in the city. It was missing something. It needed a meat like sausage or a carb. The tosatos were too light for the sauce. It came with 2 poached eggs but it was easily missed under all that tomato sauce. I felt like I was eating salsa and chips. I ended up eating it with some of the fried chicken and that made it better. 

When the guy sitting next to me at the bar got his food,  it wasn't what he had ordered. They offered to take it back to correct it but he kept it.  Guess he watched that movie Waiting. 

I would give this place another try but never by my choice. I would like to try the Benny and the Drake ceasar... and have another grapefruit mimosa. Did I already say how yummy that was?"}
{"text":"Generally a nice place to have a meal on a regular day/event if you have $$$ to blow. I came here last night for Halloween which was a HUGE mistake. The line up was all the way at the end of the street almost ... And the security/event hosts were being ridiculous by not letting anyone in eventhough THERE WAS ROOM inside the club. It's annoying when clubs purposely make people wait forever in line ups just to have a PR strategy... Get over yourselves. Anyways after 90 mins of the line not moving and all of us getting cold and sick from the rain, we dipped the place. Why the hell pay a cover fee to only party for 30 mins? bye."}
{"text":"Probably the most overrated hotel in Toronto. I went with a couple friends for dinner in the Drake lounge on Saturday (couldn't get into the Sky Yard since there was an hour wait) and it took us almost two hours to receive our food. The quality was average at best and the portions were tiny. The cost was astronomical (which I wouldn't have minded if the food had been up to par). If you're looking to thin out your wallet and have several hours to burn, you might enjoy the Drake.  Just be warned, you're basically just paying for privilege of telling people you were there, not much else."}
{"text":"Drake hotel, when it comes to your food and drink... you win... you always do. I was fairly confident that I had reviewed you in past, but as I near ridiculous levels of Yelp review-ness, a few will definitely slip through the cracks.

Cocktails are always on point here, my go to is their OF (of course, because what else do I drink aside from my standard). However there OF has changed a few times at least to my taste, and each time it's changed I've loved it all the same. The consistent point is the oversized rocks glass and a huge block of ice.

The food... ahh the food. It's good, like all good. Local, calorie laden, flavourful, you know all the things you want. This past week I went for the Fried Chicken and Waffles served with creme fraiche and season cherries. Having had the C&W before I knew I wouldn't be satiated with only one chicken thigh... so I preemptively ordered a second with my meal... bold choice, but the right one. I challenge you to challenge that move... 

My only critique of the C&W is that the chicken on some occasions (and I've had the dish on more than one occasion) can be a little dark on the cooking for my preference. It's still great, but I'm more of a golden colour sorta guy rather than browned. You dig? 

Come to think about it, I crashed on the floor of a friends room one time here and the floor was the most comfortable floor I've ever slept on.. ever (lmfao). OK, perhaps alcohol played a factor, but the rooms are pretty rad, tiny and basically an OCD persons wet dream with how they've maximized/organized this shoe box room into something that resembles something just short of a mansion by the time they were finished with it.

Come to the Drake, to eat, to sleep, to drink... to listen to music. All the things!

Eatcrest, Sleepcrest, Drinkcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Super cool place with great vibes. Definitely a nice place to go to grab a drink and a bite to eat with friends or a date--lots of people watching if you're into that as well. Prices are okay; maybe a smidgen more than I would want to pay on the regular, but definitely a great weekend option. 

Great sushi! Super enjoyed my roll. My boss loved everything he ate. We had a lot of fun. So basically, if my boss and I can have a good time together, you will probably have an even better time. Seriously!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite rooftop patios in the city. Great place to grab inventive drinks and cozy up under some patio lights in the summer. There's always a lineup on the weekends but rightfully so! FYI - they take away the chairs on the patio after a certain time in the night as it gets more packed. Night life here is live no doubt, but now let's talk about brunch...

We really enjoyed the Fried Chicken & Waffles and the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict.

Though the cranberry sauce on the fried chicken was a tad too sweet for my liking, the fried chicken itself was bomb! Poached eggs for the benedict was perfect, which made cutting into it and watching the yolk ooze onto the rest of the plate all the more fun! (Small joys, okay?) Wish I took a slow motion video... It was great that they kept the dish very simple so that the fresh ingredients did all the talking. One thing that could be improved was the biscuit for the benedict... That was a little tough to cut and chew.

And to top off a delicious brunch with a relaxing atmosphere, service was friendly and attentive. Can't complain there! I'm already excited to come back here to try more of their drinks and enjoy the patio life while summer's still around!"}
{"text":"If you love hanging out with hyper 40 yr old wannabe hipsters, come here, you'll have fun. I used to live down the street from it from when it was a scary low rent hooker hook up and they still had ducks flying across their side wall. Food is awful and expensive, so if you don't eat you'll be great. Toronto is chock full of food options, try somewhere else if you are actually hungry and are used to eating decent food. Might be nice for a coffee but I don't drink it myself. Most of the people who come here (looking a little lost) take a taxi direct to the door, they are not locals."}
{"text":"I went here for one of their 86'd events. I think it's a really cool idea and is not intimidatingly \"foodie\" but I have to say, the service left something to be desired. We were literally sitting at one of the bars and had to ask repeatedly for drinks, food, and so on. That being said, the drinks were really reasonably priced. 

However, I was here for New Year's Eve and the service (at least upstairs) was fantastic. 

Some people are worried that they won't fit in here, crowd-wise, but I say to them who cares!! I love the look of this place and the effort they are putting in to contribute to the arts scene. I don't look like a hipster, but as long as the waitstaff treats you politely, who cares?

Will definitely update when I come for a full meal."}
{"text":"I have been to the Drake hotel many a time for cocktails or concerts but yesterday I got the pleasure of enjoying a fabulous brunch with my BFF's. I never thought of the drake as a brunch joint per se but after enjoying an incredible Steak and Eggs, it will quickly become a spot I will frequent. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is brilliant. As we were finishing up, a live band was starting up. 

I highly recommend going to the drake not only for the music, the atmosphere, the cocktails but for the Brunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Toronto last week and we decided to treat ourselves to one \"pricey\" dinner for our vacation. A more accurate representation of how I feel about my experience at the Drake Hotel would be 3.5 stars but since they don't allow 1/2 stars I'm going to go with 3. So here goes...

Food: My bf wanted to try the duck. They were out of the duck =/. So we got the mussels to start and I found it underwhelming (we are from Maryland, we love seafood!!) We received 6 mussels. Seems like they could be a bit more generous on this. I actually can't remember the dish name that I had for dinner, but it had noodles & shrimp - that's all I can recall. My boyfriend had the pork chop which he thought was delicious but for just one pork chop it should be delicious!! Overall, the food wasn't memorable and that's what we were looking for. 

Service: LOVED our service. We were first time visitors to Toronto & the staff at the Drake Hotel was beyond amazing. They wrote down a lot of recommendations for bars and local hangouts to go to after our meal and we took their advice and had a nice time. Everyone was really helpful. 

Atmosphere: Cute and romantic for a date night but I was expecting a bit more \"view\" from the rooftop patio. I chose the Drake Hotel specifically after searching for places in Toronto with nice rooftops. However, it was cold so, maybe in the summer they have a different set up to show more of downtown Toronto? Not sure.  

On my next trip to Toronto, I probably won't return to the Drake Hotel but we enjoyed our evening and the hospitality. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The Drake Hotel (Toronto)

Came here for a music performance and free guacamole showdown which were awesome and  had a drink while I waited. I like the vibe for sure, good looking people and nice decor for the hip crowd. The cocktail I had was about 3 ounces of liquor which made for a stiff drink, two or 3 of these and you'd be set, specially right before a show. The guacamole showdown was awesome but who doesnt love free guac. 
PRO TIP: I wish I had more time to try the food and drinks, maybe next time"}
{"text":"The go to place for brunch for me as I live in the area.

Consistently great coffee.  Freshly squeezed OJ.  And a damn good standard breakfast plate with toast, eggs, home fries, and your choice of bacon or sausage.  I generally opt for the sausages, as they are pretty fantastic.

The blueberry scones are pretty great as well.  Haven't had a chance to try many of the other breakfast items, as when I go there, I am generally in the mood for just the basics.  Hoping to try the Chicken & Waffles next time, as they are always very tempting.

All in all a great place to get a good brunch.  Don't be surprised if the Cafe itself is packed full when you go for weekend brunch.  Have no fear though, as the restaurant area across from the Cafe generally has quite a few seats available as well."}
{"text":"Whenever I try one of these \"boujee\" restaurants, I always try to find something to nit-pick, just as an excuse to be more outraged at the price. However, I really do not have anything negative to say about this restaurant; lovely patio, excellent service, and great food. We got the burger and shrimp toast. Both arrived promptly, and the portions were appropriate for its price. The burger was incredible; quality ingridients and interesting and unique taste. The shrimp toast was also a unique dish, but I didnt think the dish was very good. The ingridents didnt flow in my opinion; I'd suggest ordering it. Will I be back, probably not, not really my scene, but I really do not have anything bad to say about it and wouldnt discourage anyone from going!"}
{"text":"Weird...just weird.

A bartender suggested the Drake Hotel's rooftop to us for a Sunday Funday Toronto style.  We arrived and proceeded up the stairs to the rooftop.  We were greeted by a \"door girl\" with a clip board.  We quickly told her we just wanted to hang at the bar and started to proceed.  She stopped us and said that there was a 20 minute wait.  I clarified \"the bar\" part to her again and again was told 20 minutes.  There was absolutely NO ONE seated at the bar at this time.  NO ONE!!!  We waited awkwardly by the door for about 3 minutes before the \"door girl\" came back over and said she had received approval from the bar for us to be seated.  WTF does that mean?  Whatever, we were approved.  We ordered our drinks and just sat for about 15 minutes and watched.  The bartenders and servers were never rude, but just never overly friendly.  We also watched as this whole bizarre door scene played out 5 more times with arriving parties.  We decided we had had enough.  We paid our tab and went downstairs to wait for the rest of our party.

Our party arrived and there is 1 high top table open.  We proceed to sit and are told to go ask the hostess if we can sit.  She comes over and says there is a 10 minute wait.  SHUT THE FRENCH UP!  Again?  Really?  So, we stand there for 15 minutes as we watch 2 other parties try to claim that table and each are denied just as we were.  So, she finally comes back to us and seats us at that same empty table we tried to sit at 15 minutes ago.

The food was just average...definitely didn't hit the spot and most of us left hungry still.

Overall, a very bizarre experience with just average food."}
{"text":"Attended a Birthday party at the Drake this past weekend.

The dinner reservation for 15 allowed us to sit upstairs, in the \"tunnel\" area, which was quite private and set away from the bar. It was a great spot for group conversations.

A price-fixe menu was arranged with lots of selection.  We started with a fresh salad, with apple, toasted pumpkin seeds and blue cheese. Delicious and so refreshing! For the main, I had the crispy chicken with butternut mash. Also, good was the arctic char and steak. Most impressive was probably the dessert ~ a cheesecake, with sweet apples on top.

Service was amazing! Our waitress was attentive all night, even when bottle service for our group began. 

Music around 10:00pm was mainly rock, with a mix of top 40. 

The Drake is a good place to have a few drinks and get some appetizers. If you're looking to have a long dinner, a reservation is recommended."}
{"text":"if you can get over the hipsters and the occasional 905er big group bday parties, it's an awesome spot. I love the drake. 
The food is awesome. I'm always happy with what I get. 
HOWEVER, I just tried their sushi for the first time because I was feeling adventurous and it's not only meh in the taste department, it's offensively overpriced. I got a tiny roll for 18 dollars and it had a fried shrimp in it- they fried a shrimp, wrapped it in seaweed and rice and charged 18 bucks?! No no no. 
Everything else is really good. Stick with the non sushi dishes. 
Oh and also I have never ever gotten drunk from drinking the vodka lemonade or the sangria (I order them by the pitcher with a friend or two whenever we are there) and we are convinced there is absolutely zero to 2% alcohol in those concoctions."}
{"text":"I had a really wonderful breakfast here one summer day on the rooftop patio and it was quite lovely. The breakfast was a great deal for the quality and quAntity you get. Service is very friendly and may I say everyone who works here ( I swear it's a requirement) is super good looking. At night they Regularly have music and great events at this spot. It is located in a very funky and up coming part of the city."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the bar and the basement concert venue in this home of the \"Toronto Hyper Intelligentsia Professional Sartorial Educates Regime\"

Was  here last night for a hip-hop show and hung out at the upstairs area of the bar. The service at the bar upstairs was friendly and the ambiance of the upstairs bar is quaint with old movies playing and Canadian pillows. Seems likes its designed to resemble a typical  cottage.

The venue downstairs is good and worked for the artists and the small but enthusiastic crowd. Only downside was the price of the rum and cokes (7.50) and the 3 dollar coat check. 

I'll will do a re review when I try the cafe or the resto."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is good BUT the name probably carries a lot of weight and marketing here. This is pop culture of restaurants. Does everything good, but doesn't have any edges that would make it stand out. Good food, good drinks, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for my New Year's event experience for 2014. 

I haven't stayed at the Drake. The first and only experience I have ever had here is for their New Year's event for 2014. My bff and her bf reserved the most expensive seating, $150, for a personal booth, and a full-course meal. I personally think this is a great deal. The package also came with a glass of bubbly. We were all surprised with how delicious the good was. The portions were also very generous. The music was surprisingly good, although a few of the same Drake songs were repeated (tsk tsk). There were a few genres played, and I think something for everyone. The majority of music was good, everyone was dancing. Sometimes the Dj started a song and ended it way too early, but overall it was good, especially in comparison to clubs. 

I had a great time, and I would do New Year's here again if given the opportunity. I think it's a perfect alternative to going to a club, while still having a club-y experience, with less pretentiousness and the rest of the mess that clubs can bring."}
{"text":"Cool venue with medium food. The vibe and ambiance are cool and there are lots of different rooms to explore but the food in the restaurant is not great.

Do order:
Crab cakes - really flavorful 

Don't order:
Pavlova - really hard, not like a true pav 
Shrimp appie- not much flavour

Decent:
Salmon sushi
Mussels 
Opera cake 
Brussel Sprouts"}
{"text":"It's a love/hate thing. I love the Drake for the lovely cafe when it's quiet. The menu can sometimes be astonishing - their deconstructed lasagna, their scone plate and a very respectable set of bennies.

One also can't discount their contribution to intensifying/gentrifying the Queen/Beaconsfield area, which I humbly coin Drake Village. And sometimes, the artwork is really wonderful.

The closet wannabe hipster in me can't stand the jacked up drink prices, the crappy overpriced food (when it is crappy and/or overpriced) and the fact that within fifteen years, the area will be unironically known as Drake Village."}
{"text":"When I lived in Toronto, I would visit this place once a month if now more. I've surely been here at least 20 times. The servers are some of the best in town and have such a positive attitude. The food is great as well! Recommendations are the Blueberry Scones, the Chicken and Waffles, and the Breakfast Burrito. The scones are a must! I will say that 2 times I received the scones they weren't good though. They forgot the sugar in the recipe or something. It was off. They did remove them from the bill though.

The patio in the summer is great and the lounge next to the windows are my favorite spots. 

My only complaint is that I think the menu prices are inflated by 20% or so. The food is good, but it's VERY easy to rack up a $80 brunch bill for 2."}
{"text":"Woops.  I got the smackdown from Kat about posting my review for the wrong business listing.  Soo... here we go again.

Un peu le poo.

I was going to leave a two star review for lunch... (let's leave it at this: the \"chicken burrito\" that Miriam and I shared had no such chicken in it... unless the word \"chicken\" in Canadian means \"egg.\")  Fortunately, we dropped in here for a quick nightcap after a super fun (and deliciously filling) Elite Event and ended up having a reasonably decent time.

The drink offerings here are pretty serious.  With a variety of drafts, bottled beers, and creative cocktails, the Drake Café offers enough libations to please pretty much anyone looking end the night in a besotted state.

The Devil's Share doesn't skimp on bourbon.  Refreshingly -not- excessively sweet, I thoroughly enjoyed the pleasant mix of orange juice and ginger beer.

I'm still a little fuzzy on whether or not it's a cultural thing, but as with our lunch here, it was a smidge on the challenging side to flag down a server when we wanted one.  Maybe it's a European thing, but I definitely went without a refilled water glass for a good ten or fifteen minutes at a time, and even after we got our check, it was a pretty sizable gap in time before anyone came around to pick it back up.

I'd much more readily return for a drink than for a bite.  It's pretty tough to argue against the chill, laid back ambiance.  Or the heavy pours.  We have an understanding, yes?"}
{"text":"A buddy of mine wanted to celebrate his birthday with style and hopefully high quality dining, so we took ourselves to The Drake Hotel on Queen St. Colour me surprised, but apparently the Drake is actually also a hotel on top of being a restaurant. No hip, ironic restaurant names here.
To paint the picture, our hostess lead us through the dining area, past a wall stocked with a mystery selection of books, by the bar, then to our marble table booth. Think modern, classy vibe, but not so classy that you're in the vote-for-Harper tax bracket.

Since we were celebrating, I put aside the diet and tried quite a few different dishes with the group. It started with the Drake + Bake, which is an appetizer of various house breads and crisps served with three different spreads, (and banana peppers for some inexplicable reason). The most impressive combo was the slightly toasted, but still supple rye bread with a scoop of what was some sort of raspberry/strawberry butter. The dish doesn't knock the ball out of the park, but serves its purpose to get you going.
After this came the Lobster Nachos. This special plate of nachos hit close to my heart as a big nacho fan. Instead of the typical salsa, the corn chips are served with a mornay sauce, cilantro, picked jalapeños, and lobster, with guacamole and lime on the side. The creamy mornay and cilantro pairing defy you to even think about craving salsa or sour cream.
For my main I ordered the Drake Dry-aged Burger along with a caesar. When this guy arrives at your table you get a little excited. The milky bun has a bit of a gleam to it, under which you'll get a glimpse of the cheddar, bacon, and Russian dressing. A bite into that milky bun will harken back to a freshly baked egg bun at first, but once you settle in it taste and feels almost like a good pot pie crust. Really appreciated that. I won't claim to have actually recognized the \"dry-aged\" quality of the beef, but the patty was obviously a good quality piece of meat. The Russian dressing turned out to be a stellar mild combo with the medium strength of the cheddar, and of course bacon is delicious. The one question mark here is the gigantic pickle that they serve on the side. I know this is typical burger pairing, but the thing was huge. (That's what she ...)
We finished it all up with a side of Drake Fries (fries, pecorino, truffle butter), and their Chocolate Banana Dacquoise for dessert. The dacquoise is sinfully good, and of course a caloric nuclear bomb, so thank God that it's a pretty small dessert. You'll get a hazelnut praline, chocolate mousse, and a crisp spiced banana.

Overall, I came away a happy man. Though the waitress did take a good while to get to our table at first, she dealt with our admittedly high maintenance group with poise. I'd be happy to go back, and would suggest it to anyone, (if they're ok with paying for the quality)."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try Drake for brunch after hearing good things about it. 

We tried their mango mimosas which was made from fresh mango juice. 

My friend ordered blueberry lemon pancakes with ricotta cream. They were fluffy, tangy and delicious. 

I loved the chicken and waffles I ordered. The chicken is boneless which made eating it very easy. The chicken was juicy on the inside and took no effort when slicing into it. It is an excellently executed sweet and savory dish."}
{"text":"Paid 60 Bucks for a nice breakfast for me and my girl don't regret a penny service
Was A 1 the food surpassed my expectations love this place best breakfast I've had in toronto!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for rooftop brunch (which was great), but severely let down our second visit for lunch.  We ordered the pasta dish which was swimming in oil and had to unfortunately send the dish back.  We also ordered the guac + chicken skins, which came with a ton of guac but not enough \"chips\" to dip with.  By chips I mean the chicken skins which were also pretty greasy.  We ended up asking for a piece of toast to finish the guac with - which they charged an extra $4 for...pretty ridiculous all around.  The salad was also a couple pieces of leaves with no option to add proteins (eg chicken).  While I'd consider coming back for brunch, the rest of the menu leaves a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"I haven't actually stayed at the Drake Hotel, but I do like the occasional Wednesday night Trivia session, so my review is just about the lounge/bar.

Wednesday nights at The Drake Hotel are Trivia nights (starts at 8pm) and it's a pretty fun time. While obscure tunes from the 80's play in the background (except for \"Eye in the Sky\" because I recognize that song from a mile away), the MC hosts an epic night of trivia. He was even nice enough to let my friends and I join in even though we decided to come in about an hour late. 

Waiters/waitresses are everywhere to be found, always making sure that drinks are topped up and to make sure that you're happy with everything. I decided to get the Drake Mojito. $12 for a mojito, but it was probably one of the strongest and best tasting mojitos that I've ever had. Service gets a big thumbs up here! Seating is plentiful and we were lucky enough to get a booth.

All in all, Trivia Night at The Drake is always a fun time. Great way to meet people and just have a low key night out. Definitely something to try!"}
{"text":"Only come here if you're with similar wannabe-hipster, faux art geek, or i'm-a-gentrifier-pretending-not-to-be-one kinda person.

all the same, good for some nights = )"}
{"text":"I had dinner on the roof, it was a nice summer night.  The food was kind of upscale comfort food, (I had BBQ ribs with the Mac n/ cheese).  Heart-stopper, but good. They have a great selection of cocktails, mojitos and the like.  It's a nice, low-key, somewhat trendy place to hang with your friends on a weekend evening."}
{"text":"i really adore this place.  the rooms are on the small side, but they utilize each square foot cleverly so.  we had a window'ed corner room, lots of light and air circulation.  very artsy, off the wall decor which was indicative of the funky w queen w 'hood.  we dined at the downstairs deli a bit and the food was pretty good.  staff were all super friendly.  location was excellent, right on the trolley line, walking distance to lots of cool places.  

we booked the special that came with a picnic lunch (delish) and 2 bikes so we could fart around town.  that was fun.  but the bike seats kind of sucked, they leaked a bit (it rained that day) so we walked around with soggy butts.  don't miss the trinity bellwoods park.  

they dont have an elevator, but i had a rob who was able to haul up the luggage :)"}
{"text":"Came here with the significant other for a fun getaway from the States, and loved everything about it: the neighborhood (gritty but friendly, and full of great bars and restaurants), the aesthetic (quirky but comfortable rooms), the staff (understatedly kind as only cool young Canadians can be), the on-site music club, and the fact that we could crank up the stereo with our iPods plugged in til the wee hours and not get into trouble. (It pays to stay in a hotel that's known for hosting touring rock stars.) Overall, well worth the drive and the splurge. 

One note: if you're booking the \"Crash Pad,\" be warned that the shower walls are see-through, which may be a pro or a con for you depending on the company you keep."}
{"text":"Must come here for Sunday brunches! I am obsessed with their chicken and waffles - preserved berries, sweet
Rosemary whipped cream! Such a guilty pleasure to have on a Sunday. Perfect mix of sweet / salty & crunchy / soft texture. Have heard good things about their fresh scones as well!"}
{"text":"It's hard to review Drake Hotel cause you can go there for so many reasons. Brunch, concert, dancing, you name it. But the thing is, every time I've gone to the Drake, it's been a good experience.

Love the foodie monday nights. Love the poetry slam nights. Dancing here is fun. And oh my gosh the eggs benny I had for brunch was so so good. It sat atop a biscuit, and was just so well done. I've eaten quite a few eggs bennies around town and Drake is right up there, if not the best one I've had in Toronto.

Next time I want to try the chicken and waffles!!"}
{"text":"I went here for Memphis Tuesdays with The Treasures (country rock-ish). Really good music, and a very unique sound the band had. Crowd was relaxed and laid back but really into the music. Cool atmosphere for music to be played too, although some of the artwork on the wall was a little bit weird.

Beers ran about $7.25-$7.75 for a pint, and the service was all around good. 

Would recommend/ go again."}
{"text":"I have been here lots of times. Always great food and vibe. Highly recommend the chicken and waffle dish in brunch menu. The best in town!"}
{"text":"Very unsatisfied with this place. 

So I had called and reserved a table for my birthday.. 
we got there, sat down. The guy takes our order eventually.. highly recommends sushi ..
they bring our food after a long a** time..  
Sushi was very small , not fresh at all . He doesnt even bring me chopsticks, takes another 15 mins for me to WAVE HIM DOWN to ask for chop sticks.. 
Doesn't check on the table at all , literally, To check if the food is okay.  My friend hated her mushroom whatever pasta .. tasted really weird . We all tried it none of us liked it. Very lemony too. Took him another at least 15-20 mins to finally come cause we were staring him down.  She wanted to order a replacement but he took so long she got mad and didnt want anything.

I asked him for a shot of tequila, wanted to get tipsy so i dont call the manager and lose it . He forgets about it. Another 15 minutes goes by and i ask my friend to go up to him as hes wandering around cleaning a table, to remind him to please bring my effing shot. 

So he does... 


Im sorry. Im a server myself, that was ridiculous. 
They had even asked me over the phone if we're celebrating an occasion, i had said MY BIRTHDAY. 
Im sure they noted it. Servers know about their tables.. 
he wouldnt come around to check on the table , we had to desperately wave him down or go find him 25 mins at a time. 

My friend also , came late , they wouldnt let her in & said she had to pay cover. 
I HAD A TABLE RESERVED , WE'RE EATING AND PAYING YOU, AND U DONT LET ONE OF MY GUESTS IN SO WE HAVE TO RUSH AND LEAVE SO SHE DOESNT WAIT LONG OUTSIDE???? 


Never returning, and not recommending to anyone. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Inordinately crowded on a Saturday night with a huge line out the door: luckily we got there earlyish and got a table.  Lets just say it this way: I had a small average $20 hamburger.  This type of place is more about the crowds I guess, which seems like your above average hipster type that is willing to smash onto a small roof or a club below with other made up hipsters and pay dearly for it.  Fun for the first night of a conference with good friends but this would be a rarely tolerable event in my life back home.  Waitress seemed overworked and slow, no doubt from the crowd."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Saturday. We waited for 20 mins but we were lucky enough to sit close to the window and had a very nice view. 
The chicken and waffle was really good. Chicken was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. 
I would give this place a 5 star however, the bacon I had was too crispy and dry. 

Atmosphere: young and hip

Recommendation: come early if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I was actually really disappointed with my brunch item.  The Shakshuka dish arrived with only two pieces of baguette -- if you can even call it that.  They were more like thin slices of crostini.  You could either eat the polenta (with the spicy tomato sauce and baked egg) with the spoon or use the baguette to scoop it up to eat with.  There should have been at least four pieces of baguette with the dish.  It was a really small brunch item and even after I finished it, I didn't feel rather full.   For a $15 dish, I expected to be full.

In terms of the polenta, it was tasty but not incredibly 'creamy' as they described it in the menu.  The spicy tomato sauce was a refreshing mixture and reminded me of a bruschetta that I was eating.  Aside from the small portion of the dish, I was also really irked that one of the two provided baguette pieces was severely burnt and blackened.  It's not healthy to eat burnt food.  Unfortunately, I wasn't vocal enough to let the server know about this otherwise I would have asked to receive a fresher piece of baguette; one that wasn't burnt.

On the other hand, two of our friends ordered the Drake Benny.  This had two homestead eggs, country ham, arugula, English muffin, hollandaise, and potato hash (with the option to add $3 to substitute the ham for smoked salmon or  roasted mushrooms).  The Drake Benny dish looked really great, presentation-wise, and was definitely filling in terms of the portion.  I tried one bite of it from Kim's plate and really loved the soft poached eggs along with the hollandasie sauce and country ham.  It was delicious!  It was just too bad that the Shakshuka dish was such a sad comparison."}
{"text":"I dined at The Drake Hotel with my boyfriend for New Years, we opted for the five course dinner. 

The five course dinner came with three appetizers--marinated scallops, duck liver pate, roasted beet, a shared seafood platter, and pan seared foie gras. The appetizers were amazing, though the portion sizes seemed small, the quality of the food left you satisfied with the amount of food. The combination of flavors was also fantastic. For me personally, it all went down hill from there. They served lobster carbonara after the foie gras; I was really excited for this dish but I was left disappointed. The idea of the carbonara was good, but it was just too rich and lacked something to lighten it up--perhaps some lemon? I think they would've been better off with a lobster pasta that was olive oil based and let the lobster take care of the flavor. It was way too rich for me, especially after the foie gras. The main course was good, but I wasn't as impressed with it as I was with the appetizers. The dessert in the end was also delicious, but I'm not much of a chocolate person so I don't have anything else to say about it. We also got a glass of sparkling night to toast at midnight.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal at The Drake Hotel. Although I disagreed with their decision to put the lobster carbonara on the menu, I still enjoyed the whole dining experience, and I can see myself coming back for something else in the future."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Tues April 8 2014.  The Drake is just down the street from us, and although we prefer it for drinks in the summer on their upstairs patio, we thought we would give it a chance for dinner.  We were wrong in our thinking.   The only item that was passable were the BC oysters.  Our main dishes were an overwhelming disappointment.   Underdone scallops that were not seared (as promised on the menus), chewy/rubbery lobster, nearly raw baby potatoes, and a general lack of love or care put into the food. It was so bad that the manager comp'ed the above mentioned and apologized.  Yet the executive chef (Ted Corrado) was present in the kitchen!  The Drake just celebrated their 10th year anniversary.  It would be interesting to see if the kitchen survives in this manner for even another 12 months with their lack of attention to food quality and detail."}
{"text":"The place was cool and the store across the street is awesome, although I was hoping they would have some (Blue) Jays caps for sale though. I made the mistake of bringing a Yankees cap to this trip...

Breakfast at The Drake Hotel was great. I ordered the Drake Breakfast with a piece of their fried chicken on the side. Highlight of the meal were the house made sausage and the fried chicken. Wish I had more of the sausage while the fried chicken was nice and crispy."}
{"text":"This is a review for a Social Feed TO event held at The Drake Hotel.

The Drake Hotel is not a place that I have been to many times.  I had been here once with a friend and former co-worker when she came back to Toronto and it coincided with TIFF, so it was packed and definitely a \"happening\" place to be.  That was a little over 2 years ago.Queen West past Bathurst isn't exactly the most exciting part of the strip, but the likes of the Drake and Gladstone bring in the crowds.

My first ever Social Feed experience was at Marben, and it was nothing short of awesome.  So I've been on high alert for up and coming events.  As I came out of recovery mode post wisdom-tooth extraction, I decided that The Drake + The Social Feed would be a great way to ease back into the social scene.

I arrived \"fashionably on time\" and although we missed co-founder Reggie Milligan this time around, the folks at the Drake were well-organized.  A simple checking off of my name from the list and we were escorted to the cozy, communal table for 18 towards the back. 

I actually had +2s to this event, and because we arrived late, we were thrust into the \"social\" aspect of the event early on (being unable to sit together).  But hey, that's part of the fun.  I was graced with the company of project managers, media magnates (read managing editor for 680news.ca and online advertising guru employed by Yahoo! Canada).  I even got a few pointers from a TD financial advisor on what to do with my money instead of letting the bank pay us trivial interest while  they take our hard-earned cash and make their millions!  

Unfortunately I did not get to sip on the Mill Street brew as I was still on antibiotics - so one of my +2s went home a little happier than usual with 2 beers under his belt!

The most memorable dish of the evening for me was definitely the Caesar Salad Royale clad with generous chunks of lobster, a dressing with a hint of wasabi, and some outcasted ingredients (avocado and tomatoes, that would normally have no place in a Caesar Salad).  The bread crumbs were heavenly - perfectly garlicky and salty.  I ended up noshing on these instead of the actual basket of garlic bread that came post haste.

My only real complaint is that the steak came cold.  I guess that's why the dishes they gave us were so warm?!  The pasta was great (if you liked olives).  The Drake took a bit of a risk IMHO because although there were sweet tomatoes and earthy mushrooms in the mix, the predominant flavour was still OLIVES.  And olives is something you either hate or love.  

The garlic bread was also cold.  As mentioned above, I found the croutons to be tastier.  The edges were also severely burnt.  Hey!  Just because I was born in the month of July and I'm a Cancer doesn't mean...

The Rapini also had a burnt taste to it (but at least it wasn't cold?)  

The Tiramisu was a heavy heavy dessert, and it was served with a chocolate-chip-almond-ginger-bread-biscotti.  Wasn't a fan of the chocolate chips, and I wasn't a fan of the stale factor either.  

All b!tching aside, the staff were stellar, keeping our glasses topped up and checking in on us.  The crowd at the Drake is definitely what I would classify as \"hipster\" but don't let that keep you from coming.  As I was leaving around the 10 o'clock mark, I saw a band setting up on stage.  Culture + Food + Good Times = The Drake."}
{"text":"Dinner 

Truffled Lasagna was so delicious. Prepare yourself for this, because it was extremely filling and I truthfully couldn't finish it. The right amount of mushrooms (some places overdo it) and the puree was lovely."}
{"text":"WHY DO PEOPLE COME HERE TO EAT??? DO YOU NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN??
This is the Milestones of the West. 
If you are a lost human being in the queen west area using the Yelp app DO NOT GO HERE you're better off throwing some bills in the wet gutter and going to Mcdonalds. This will give you more satisfaction.
I have made this mistake multiple times so you do not have to! Why settle for mediocrity when there are so many great places around??"}
{"text":"((This is a review for the Winterlicious event  - Guilty Pleasures))

It's the second time we came to this annual event, organized by the Drake and the Fashion Incubator.  The first time, last year, we had a lot of fun, and decided to make it a tradition. This year, it wasn't the same, it was hard not to compare, but that's how it is. 

The event is described as: 
\"Toronto's favourite fashion brunch, is back by popular demand! Start your weekend with a scrumptious three-course brunch featuring fresh juice, blueberry scones, soft and sexy scrambled eggs and so much more. Browse through rack after rack of original Canadian designs, collect limited edition pieces and peruse one-of-a-kind accessories and jewellery.\"

FUN RIGHT?

We got there at 3pm (more on that later), and was greeted by some pretentious people at the entrance to the dining area. I say this, because I was looking to see if my friends were there, and their attitude and annoyance that I didn't approach them first before peering into the dining area didn't sit well with me. 

We had to have the 3pm seating as I called in January to book the tickets for the Feb 5th event, and apparently most of the seatings had already sold out. Last year we had an earlier seating, and perhaps it made all the difference. 

We were supposed to have pastries waiting for us as we came in, but I had to ask for them. They were significantly lacking from last year (see my blog post (http://restodiary.blogspot.com/2010/02/guilty-pleasures-vi-at-drake.html) especially since this year we had an extra person.  Coffee and mimosas are included ($10 value). You also get a Parfait (lacking again with fruits), $8.50 value) and a choice of Eggs Benedict, Buttermilk Pancakes, and A vegetable tart. I believe this is the same menu as last year. 

I have a more discerning taste than last year, so I feel that there was nothing really that special with the eggs benedict. There are places that would charge less (most likely)  or give you much more ($12.50 value)

My girlfriends had the Buttermilk Pancakes ($12 value) LOVED them, and a huge factor in our returning next year. They were creamy tasting (how can?!) and topped with stewed berries.

I loved the concept that during our meal, we could shop and there were was a fashion show, showcasing the designers available in the booths around the hotel.  Last year, the models gave each table business cards so that we know where to find them later; this year they didn't bother. 

They have booth for local designers for clothes, bags and jewellery. Like a mini one of a kind show. There is also a silent auction when some really good stuff there. 

My biggest complaint (other than the fact we didn't get goody bags like last year) was that shopping and the silent auction ended at 4:00pm
I mean, it was 3:45 when our main course arrived! How is it possible that we could shop afterwards?? Could someone have informed me this when I booked the late seating?? The room was full of diners! And everyone was just getting their meals! Could they not have extended this for an extra hour? What was the rush?!

The whole shopping experience is one of the main factors you pay a slight premium to come here - and it was incredibly rushed. When we told them about this conumdrum - she says, \"we can go until 4:20\" .... seriously.....

The cost of the event is $35 plus tax ($42) and you about a $30+tax value in terms of food. I would really expect to have the leisure time to shop. 

+1 star for being awesome next year, and I hope with an earlier seating will make it better. We're going to give it one more chance (because of the pancakes). 

Free parking one street east, on Lister (one way south)
Free one hour parking two streets east Mon to Sat, until 6pm
Street parking is $1.50 an hour

Update:
I wrote a tasteful disappointment feedback letter to the Drake hotel themselves stating my concerns about timing.  The lady in charge of catering/food has informed me that they are planning to re-vamp the event, making it better, longer and bigger.  She also invited me+1 as her personal guest next year. Looks like I'm going again, and will need to update my review! 
GREAT customer Service."}
{"text":"For real. This place was amazing. Starting with the awesome customer service provided by Jonathan and Julien, who allowed us a super early check-in, to surprising us with champagne in our room. Everyone we dealt with was great. The atmosphere was fun, lively, fresh. We had a room on the 3rd floor so when we got back super late and saw the long line down the street for people to get into the club portions, we wondered how loud it would be in our rooms. Didn't hear a thing! We had drinks on the rooftop patio and they were sooooo delicious. There was fresh coffee on our floor in the morning and brunch downstairs on the patio was yummy. Don't skip the chicken and waffle! YUM! 
We will definitely stay here again the next time we're adventurnig in TO."}
{"text":"Lovely spot for brunch on the weekends. The chicken and waffles are amazing... by far the best savory waffle I've had in Toronto. The Drake is quaint and quirky, perfect for something outside the typical hot spot."}
{"text":"Weekend Brunch Review:

I hadn't been to the Drake for almost 5-years so we decided to spend some time on the patio and enjoy a beer and some food. We were told the patio receives sun all afternoon and if we needed the umbrella, just ask. Good drink selections and we focused more on the craft beer, which again did not disappoint. After catching-up, we finally ordered some food, as the folks next to us received their food order and it looked quite tasty. I was delighted to see a Croque Monsieur/Madame on the menu and my friend opted for a burger. Service was fast and the plates were quite full and hot. All good signs, except for the over cooked fries, which was quickly substituted with a perfectly cooked version. Unfortunately, the Croque Monsieur did not hit the mark and I could only finish half as it was just not tasty. I enquired about the burger which replied it was okay, nothing special. Seems to be a common theme amongst popular/trendy Toronto resto's who are just so so when it comes to sumptuous food experience. I would rate it closer to 3 with a buyer beware on the food during weekend brunch. Could have been just the one meal so I do not want to be too critical. Cortado was great and so was the beer and patio :-)"}
{"text":"Cushioned snugly in the heart of what used to be the seedier side of Queen West, The Drake is the unofficial headquarters for artists, musicians, designers and other scenester types. It's atmospheric and moody, the perfect platform to drinks, exchange repartees (often witless repartees depending on how many cocktails you've had), dance and listen to music. 

Apparently the food's good, too."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch at the Drake is rather fantastic.

The eats: the full monty style breakfast...bacon, eggs, sausages, pancake, toast and homefries is super filling and perfect for a hangover. Couple this with fresh juice and searing hot delicious latte and \"jobs a good 'un\".  My OH had the breakfast burrito which I assume was tasty given the rate at which it was consumed.  I did not try the breakfast scones but just from the description on the menu I really want to.

The Drake: having frequented the Drake on nights out I was wondering if they could pull off a decent brunch as we'll as hosting great night time events. The answer is yes! The day I chose to go was over labour day weekend and it was quiet, I don't anticipate this is the norm. Staff were friendly and service was fast. Mixed crowd with some people who were definately suffering from the night before; young families; brunch dates. Music was tasteful and added to the very laid back and casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am not typically a 5 star awarder and I realize that the drake probably doesn't need anymore publicity but credit where credit is due. 
The brunch here is worth a return trip. Solid ambiance, super friendly and kid friendly staff and in my view some of the best eggs Benny in Toronto.
Hot sauce is A+"}
{"text":"Fabulous hotel with personality, my favorite anywhere. Exceptional staff keep it real (no phony love) and set a high standard.  Love the artfully designed room layout.  Bars and restaurants are superb.  Quirky in all the right ways-- lounging with creative cocktails at the open air Sky Bar, ordering room service sensual toys from the Pleasure Menu.  Class operation all the way.  Love the West Queen St location amongst galleries and arts-oriented shops.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's easy to see why it made Travel + Leisure Magazine's Top 500 Hotels in the World: The Drake Hotel has thought of everything. From their demonstrated commitment to the environment (they've dispensed with tiny shampoo bottles in favor of MALIN+GOETZ products in large, re-fillable bottles) to their achingly hip dining room, bar and cafe, this hotel has left no detail to chance.

The rooms are spacious and will duly impress even the most serious design snob among us. The iPod docking station in the room is something I wish every hotel room had - it lets me have a dance party every morning when I wake up!

Asking for a \"quiet room\" at the Drake may seem like a misnomer but when I did on my first visit the staff knew just where to stash me. I like this room so much that I asked for it again on a return visit. Jonathan L at the front desk was even sweet enough to do some room shuffling to ensure I could have it! Oh how I love when folks make my wishes come true!

While I haven't had the chance to take advantage of their 'pleasure menu' I love that they have one!

I spent last night in another Toronto hotel and all I could think was, \"I want to go back to the Drake!\" The only hotel I like better than this one is the Harmony Hotel in Nosara, Costa Rica.

Best of all, the Drake is affordable! While some of its amenities are very luxurious, you won't find luxury hotel prices here (nor will you find an elevator so pack light in order that you can more easily hoof it up the stairs!)"}
{"text":"This is just a review of the food. Not the hotel or events.

I don't understand the praise for the food at the Drake. The menu is stuffy and the selection is limited. Everything is grossly overpriced, the portion size is small (even for Canada) and they are not very accommodating for various diets. I would call their style of cuisine \"Fried Buttermilk Normcore\". 

As a place for drinks only, the Drake is decent unless it's Thursday - Saturday and then it will be slammed with a lot of people from the 905 who now infect the Ossington strip and trickle over area. 

I like that they have a trivia night, but for brunch or dinner it really falls short of its looks and reputation.

They really need to re-evaluate their menu."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with the Drake. Like most Torontonians, I've had epic nights of food and drink here, and I've probably dropped hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars there over the years. The joint is a Queen West institution. I'm giving it a 2 star rating mainly because of the terribly inconsistent service. Sometimes, it's on point... Flawless. Other times, it can best be described as \"clueless\". Unfortunately, it's the bad experiences that define a place, but since the Drake draws folks from all over the city and abroad, I'm guessing they don't feel the need to give each and every customer world-class service; the service standard is at the whim of the individual server. So... Good luck."}
{"text":"Ive been to the Drake several times now and every event has had the same horrible customer service. I actually despise going there, but sometimes it's not my choice. 
For example today I was at the bar and was ignored by several staff, after flagging down several servers, 3 of them couldnt even give me a yes or no answer to \"is there someone working this bar\". Same thing with needing a napkin, I had to ask THREE staff members for a napkin, the first two told me they couldnt help me. Im pretty sure you dont need qualifications or certifications to hand me a napkin, so anyone in a staff uniform could hand me a napkin. I just cant handle how pretentious and unhelpful the staff is. Nor do they ever say excuse me, they constantly just push people out of the way. If a server cant get by because tables taking up too much space, the poorly planned layout should be rethought. Anyway, this place isnt worth the hype."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, quality of food, service and pricing is all just so perfect at the Drake. My only dislike is that apparently they do not accept reservations over the phone but our waitress said that they normally do. Im not sure what's happening with that but the staff is clearly unsure of some things. Kinda annoying when people are not on the same page. That's really the only reason why Im not rating a 5 star!"}
{"text":"This review will solely be about the club/bar:

I have to admit I did not know this place was a club until we got there. I came with a group of friends who wanted to go. There were some of us (including myself) who have never been and we were not dressed for clubbing. The bouncer almost didn't let one of the guys in because of his sandals. Cover charge of $10, must bring cash. The lineup also can get very long after midnight.

Atmosphere: This place has multiple floors and it was packed because we went on a Saturday night. Lots of people dancing and having fun. We also lined up to go to the rooftop patio where I really enjoyed chilling out from the loud music downstairs.

Music: The music was not anything amazing but they do play different music on each floor.

Drinks: The drinks were expensive, as you can probably imagine. Beers over $7 per bottle, shots were almost $10 each. 

All in all, we had a lot of fun, but we also almost broke our wallet. Like I said I didn't know it was clubbing, and I personally do not enjoy that kind of environment anymore (had enough in undergrad). Perhaps for a club in Toronto this place was good but I had clubbed mostly in Montreal, and you just can't compare."}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and was sorely disappointed. The decor is very nice and makes for great photo ops, but the food and service was quite bad. Service was incredibly slow - took the waiter 10 mins to give us a menu, another 20 before taking our order, and another 30-40 before food actually came. Food quality was also disappointing. The French onion soup was very salty (even for a French onion soup!) and had a weird overpowering taste to it. I believe this had something to do with the broth that was used in the making of it, but it did not taste like a traditional French onion soup. The baked halibut was also disappointing and the vegetables added to the dish did not complement the fish well. When we asked for the bill, it was also wrong. The waiter had added 2 steaks to our receipt totalling an extra $80 that we did not order.

Overall, very disappointing experience and I wish I had chosen a better tried and true place for a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to the Drake a few times for drinks. I love the decor, easy going almoshpere and friendly service. Cherry on top, they fix the drink just right. 

I like how they change the patio decore for winter into something warm and cozy. The big fire pit and the little tents are awesome. 

Seeing how many people have good thing to say about thier brunch. I`ll have to try it and add my two cent (nickle in our case) about it."}
{"text":"advice for the drake. stop trying to do so much. this was a classic example of a place that needs the \"less is more\" talk. i sat at the bar and the bartender was super cool and made me a WICKED drink call \"the other lady\" or something. pretty much a manhattan/old fashion style drink with a fantastic house made syrup and some tequila. the dude that makes the drinks should get his own spot and just do a cocktail bar. the rest of the place brings it down. i was recommended the burger by my friend at the bar who raved about it. so i went for it...i shoulda known better. how can there be a burger better than Zuni or Namu's ? well this one missed BIG TIME. dry over done, stale bread....not impressed. definently better than your average burger but it wouldn't stand a chance against the big boys."}
{"text":"The only thing I've ever been blown away by at the Drake is the bill. 

The atmosphere is beautiful. I love coming during off times to meet with friends... but the food is always mediocre. And with prices where they are - I expect more. There is definitely more competition in the area than there has ever been. 

I will happily pay for quality, but that's not something I've ever seen here. The cocktails are always too sweet. It's probably the only place I've ever been that's managed to make lobster taste bland."}
{"text":"The hotel room 202 is designed to be funky, and although portrays style, it. Lacks functionality.    Some Lights didn't work, wood counters on bath sink aren't fastened so glasses tipped and broke on floor.  Shower water leaks out major, and bar noise is very loud in the room.  Not real easy to live here.   Nice to look at."}
{"text":"I give this 4 because i had a great time with my friends, However how i felt about the drake was a bit more 3 stars. So I came here with 4 of my friends for dinner to celebrate my birthday. Two of my friends ordered the sushi that they offered, honestly its 8 pieces and not really worth it because there is all you can eat sushi that you can get for 5 dollars more than the price they put for 8. One of my friends got the mac and cheese, it tasted great, the taste of expensive cheese was there, but the amount of it was not enough, quite a small portion for mac and cheese and for the price. Another got the Cauli burger, and she's a vegetarian and so she's had many vege burgers, and from what she said it wasn't that special for her, apparently just tasted like a soy burger. I had the spring salmon, cooked to perfection, portion was great, came with a salad and was good. The drake overall though is totally over hyped and their prices are high and I don't really get it. The interior is okay, I've seen better. Theres no special ambiance..we sat in a booth weirdly facing the bar and the whole \"restaurant\". It was like a people watching seat or a people can watch you type of seat lol I also had the brown butter maple old fashioned, which was good but I'm no expert in alcohol..expensive but I went for a special occasion so i didn't really care. We also had a dessert which was the brownie that had no flour or something..we split that between the 5 of us, which resulted in small bites between us, however it tasted really good, so I recommend that. Even though i can't recall the actual name ,its good dessert to share for 2.(don't be like us lol)"}
{"text":"This review is not for the hotel but for the rooftop bar. It was meh. The crowd is not as diverse as I thought it might be and was actually full of bros. Hmmm. The drinks are pricey but not crazy ($12 martini). What bothered me most was the service. We stood around for at least 10 minutes at a non-peak hour waiting for someone to talk to us. It had been raining earlier so the patio benches were wet and we asked a server if she could wipe them down for us. She said the hostess would do it but then never spoke to the hostess who appeared not to exist. We sat ourselves. Our server didn't smile and certainly didn't earn her tip which we gave to her anyway (because its just what people do now?!). I was not impressed. They have a nice view though I guess. Meh."}
{"text":"I went here for Saturday brunch with a group of 8. The side patio is beautiful, especially in the morning when the bulk of the hotel keeps it nicely shaded. I also really like the collection of tables they're using. Each is different. Old, worn and rustic furniture gives this outdoor spot a very charming and inviting presence.

Now the food... it was alright, but the problem is I can compare it directly to another restaurant in the area, and that comparison doesn't favour the Drake Hotel. They offer Eggs Caleb, which is essential Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. Shanghai Cowgirl about a 20 minute walk east along queen also offers the same dish.  The difference is their version offers quite a bit more kick in the flavour department over the Drake.

I also ordered a caesar with my meal and I wasn't overly impressed with that part of the meal either. It tasted more like HP sauce than a caesar, so I suspect their recipe must be a little liberal with the Lea & Perrin's. 

Overall, I say the patio is a great spot, but if you are excepting your taste buds to be blow away I wouldn't hold your breath on this place."}
{"text":"Came here breakfast while visiting Toronto with my girlfriend. The inside of the restaurant was super cool , love the art and classic diner feel. The food was amazing !!! My girlfriend ordered the chicken and waffles was phenomenal. The cherry glaze on the chicken was to die for and the waffle was super fluffy. Some of the best chicken and waffles I've had.  I ordered the Drake breakfast which is a classic 2 egg breakfast but comes with a side ordered of baked beans which isn't common in the US and I loved it. Such a great experience for a brunch in Toronto"}
{"text":"A group of girls and I were recently here for a Bachelorette brunch. Let me just say the service was awesome. There were about 14 girls and the staff was very accommodating. The food was so delicious with great portion sizes. They also had friendly vegetarian options. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are here tonight for the first time in many years. We ended up eating in the sky deck (rooftop patio) and while the vibe and atmosphere is still super cool - the food and drinks were way below expectations. 

The appetizers were ok but the trout was swimming in oil and the rabbit pasta was bland but bordering on unappetizing. 

Worth a visit but don't go too far out of your way."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a taste of their famous weekend brunch (this is quite a feat considering I usually sleep in on weekends and I live FAR, far uptown, so the hype was real)

I definitely was not let down. Everything about the food was great. It was delicious, they had a lot of interesting plates (from homey dishes to more exotic, like poke), and the presentation of the food was beautiful. I don't even like chicken waffles, but that day, I was converted.

I highly recommend this place for brunch. It's perfect for a low key but special occasion too. It's a little pricey as well, but given the quality of the food, it's totally worth it.

PS: I also came here for their bar and club one Saturday night, and the atmosphere was really great. Cheers to you Drake hotel!"}
{"text":"This review is just for the lounge/bar/nightclub portion. We did not see the hotel, unfortunately.

The music was ok, the crowd was ok, people seemed to be having fun and there were three levels of bars/dancing.

Eh, I've seen much better. The crowd was very down to earth and not pretentious as some described (but maybe I'm biased). I'm accustom to Miami and NYC crowds who can be the most pretentious of them all. I probably wouldn't run back for drinks and dancing, but I would love to see the hotel.

This area of Queen st is the best, though!"}
{"text":"Drake Hotel is nice to get some quick drinks but it can get pretty busy. They have some industry nights with a drink or food competition. Recently, I went to a competition where they create mix drinks with whiskey. The crowd is great and they provide some good entertainment when trying to find a winner. 

I have been there a couple times where they have food competitions. Some in the past included fried chicken and roast pork. I believe they have a few competitions coming up with lamb and beef. Best part is that the samples are free. Make sure to get there early or else you may miss out on the good stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent times, had a very tasty dinner, awesome old fashioned, had to visit the photo booth downstairs and watched an incredible couple of acts in the underground. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I hate the Drake. Let me tell you why I hate the Drake: I hate the Drake because it loves itself so so much. Leave the Drake alone in a room with itself and a mirror and the Drake would be amused and occupied for eternity. The Drake probably doesn't have many brain cells.

My impression of the Drake, on the single occasion that I went, was that it charged way too much for crappy food, and that the clientele were completely and utterly fascinating, fascinating because they were entirely unaware that they were in Toronto and not Miami or L.A. A lot of designer handbags and high heels. A lot of pretension. A lot of Look-At-Me mentalities. 

I have to give the Drake this: it has a great patio, and they serve a killer sangria: cloves and Jack Daniels. Who would have thought?! 

Having worked at a restaurant for two years I understand that when things get busy, you don't want people hanging around and not ordering anything. I went with a party of 10 for a birthday, having been told well in advance that we could by no means stay more than an hour and a half (due to other reservations). People with clip boards (entirely unnecessary accessories, only elevating the pretension) came around periodically to remind us of the time, only to tell us later on that the reservation after us canceled and that we were welcome to stay. Thanks. 

Although the Drake makes a good drink, it creates a kind of vibe I do not jive with. I like going to a place where I don't look out of place sans a designer handbag."}
{"text":"We stopped here because we were interested in using their photobooth.  We thought it'd be an authentic one, chemicals and all . . . but it turned out to be a digital booth with a weird horizontal orientation.  It was decent, but not what we were interested in.

We asked the hostess where we should go eat, and  she suggested the lounge off the lobby.  Of course she did.  We decided to give it a shot and were pretty pleasantly surprised.  The decor is pretty interesting.  It's sort of a comfy retro-hipster vibe, but we dug it.  It was pretty crowded when we were there (past 8 p.m. on a Friday or Saturday night, I can't remember), and the Bud Light Lime girls were there, which was sort of weird in that atmosphere . . . but we got free beers that tasted like Fruit Loops.  And that's a good thing because I ordered a pisco sour, and I guess they were out of pisco, so I got a mai tai instead.  It was pretty good, but I really wanted that pisco sour.  We weren't super hungry, either, so we just got the beef carpaccio, which came dressed with some truffle oil, arugula, and delicious cheesy flatbread.  It appeared that the beef was sort of seared on the outside, which I'm not used to for carpaccio, but it was still really good!  The server was super nice and not pretentious, which is always a worry at places like this.  The DJ was also spinning some great songs.  I even heard a song I heard a long time ago in a bar in Chicago that I've never been able to figure out, and he was gracious enough to tell me what it was when I asked.

At some point, a large line formed sort of in the middle of the place, and I'm guessing that was for the rooftop bar.  We stood in the line for a few minutes, but it wasn't going anywhere, so we ditched it.  We don't have the patience for that kind of thing.

We have a lot of friends and relatives who live in and near Toronto, so chances are that we're not going to stay at this hotel, ever, which is kind of a bummer because it seems neat.  We also checked out the adjacent general store and ice cream shop.  I think we got a sample of some ice cream they had (I don't remember the flavor), and it was good, and the general has some great things on offer.  Overall, I thought this place was pretty great, and I'll definitely go back when I'm in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"So what are you doing tonight?

Going to The Drake! 

It's been the 'go to' place for those living in the west end for quite sometime now, and with good reason. There's never a night that the Drake isn't PACKED to the brim with drunken 20 somethings getting wasted and dancing like there's no tomorrow. 

But don't worry, there's tons of room to party hardy. The basement features mind-blowingly loud beats, lots of seating and tons of hot Torontonians getting their freak on. The main level provides more fancy seating, a slightly calmer atmosphere and a huge bar. The patio, which is the place to be in the warmer months, is huge! Tons of seating, a smoking area and a gigantic bar that is always packed and requires careful maneuvering in order to actually acquire a bevvy. 

For out of towners, The Drake is a must. Even for those who live in the city, The Drake is always a safe bet when you're looking for some good beats and lots of booze!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular guest at The Drake every couple of months for more than a year. And this past stay, I was lucky enough to stay in the room that received my last \"Dear Room\" Yelp review.

Hello Again 208,

Since I first yelped about you, I have come to fall in love with a number of your other Drakenesses. Your theme song that serenades me when I walk in, the piece of fudge, cookie or peppermint bark that waits for me on the nightstand. The little note that reads \"Welcome Back Crystal.\" Honestly Drake, this is why I keep coming back. I love the little touches. 

Even the services I have not taken advantage of intrigue me: the pleasures menu, the spa menu, the kazoo party. Yup, you can buy your own party in a paper bag. Every time I visit I get a General Store coupon, and every once in a while, a drink coupon. How nice! If anyone is reading this and wants to buy me a present, I have been eyeing the harmonica necklace that you can also buy right in your room. 

You have a few quirks, but for me that is just part of your charm: the old pipes rattling, calling downstairs for a room service menu and the taped toilet paper and no waste bin in the loo. 

It's like you have your own personality, and for that I say don't change. Keep it quirky! 

Love,
Crystal"}
{"text":"Drake Hotel... I like the Cafe, it is really nice I often have a soy smoothie and fruit bowl. Good place for a casual, easy, meeting and nobody is getting there Hipster Snipe or heavy sigh on regarding whatever it is you are up to... 

But at night, I think it was Thursday... We went into the main area, and were greeted by this curly haired glasses dude in a purple jacket who looked at me like I was trash. He clearly likes the fragrance of his own toots. I politely told him we would like to eat and that there were four of us, (There were these awesome big black kind of industrial tables in the middle, I asked for one of those) the response... I can't put you at a table but you can sit on the big bench on the side to eat, there are small tables there... The guy puts us in a back corner where it was super Dark, I could barely see the people across from me. Weird. So when he lead us into the corner I asked why we couldn't eat at the centre tables, he said they were being moved for dancing... 

So we sit at the side table area, order our drinks (the blond female server was very polite and efficient) 

So were sitting there getting our jackets off and the curly haired glasses guy seats 4 people at the exact table we wanted... and they ate too... about 5-8 minutes later... 

We asked for our bill right away, paid and left. Did not even order food, we were offended!!! My feelings were hurt, this was the first time I ever felt really disrespected by anyone in a Customer Centric Role. I also just moved to the area, and was feeling really regretful regarding that just then. 

I will never go back into the main area ever again. I was mortified. 

Gladstone Cafe is where I meet with my supply rep for my company, and we have always had great service there. My Buddy Aleks recommends Whoopi Pies. I recommend the smoothies!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. Service was excellent and the food are amazing. Everything were made in-house and is the flavour that you cannot find it anywhere else."}
{"text":"Saw the Taste of Iceland menu on the Yelp Events and *reindeer* popped out on the menu.  

We hit March Break return traffic and were quite late; they actually called and we're cool with the reservation stretch and addition of a person.  Points for being super nice about it too.    

There was a series of spaces, the restaurant, a lounge area, a raw sushi bar and a front waiting area taken over by some sort of art class projecting designs on the wall.  It was a mixed crowd from hipsters to odd British folk and some of the pretty crowd.  

Back to the main attraction, I had 'Rudolph goes to the olympics,' and the ruby red center was a tender, smoother than steak delight, not as gamey as I would gave guessed with an odd but complimenting cauliflower foam.  The lobster and also cod small plates were weak, using less of the key ingredients and more potatoes.

Overall, fairly interesting and will probably come back for a concert, saw some decent posts on the way out."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday last night and it was a great pick! We had a large group that was kinda mingling on the rooftop patio and not sitting down anywhere but the staff was very accommodating, if a bit MIA (busy night after all). The food was good, but on the pricey side considering the portions weren't that large. I had the lobster nachos and I would definitely recommend it. My friend ordered the truffle fries, and it didn't seem to be worth it (small portion, even if the flavour was good). I tried a few of the drinks too - paper plane was so easy to drink, as was their house wine. This is a fun, chill spot. Suggest getting here around 9 to beat the crowds and still get some grub!"}
{"text":"I love coming to drake for brunch! They have the best scones in the city and really bomb chicken and waffles. I like how the place is always live and definitely embraces the hipster vibe of queen west. They also have a good salad selection for those that like a lighter meal."}
{"text":"I like the Drake however I must admit I have never actually stayed here.

For a few years in a row, I took my mom to the special Mother's Day brunch in the Drake Underground and was always impressed with the food and live entertainment. Also love all of the random artwork in the lobby and other common areas. 

Most recently, the bae and I ended up here randomly on a Monday during the 86'd drink competition. We got to sample free whiskey based drinks on the house. The one I enjoyed the most had foie gras pureed into it. Sounds weird but was surprisingly good. 

The Drake is a fun spot to drop in on any given night :)"}
{"text":"Friday night club review ($10 entry fee, ~5-10 minute wait past midnight) -

Not sure what people see here? Sound system is subpar and the music is terribly mixed. Why does the DJ choose to move onto the next track when the current one is juust getting good? At least the patio upstairs is a nice escape during a hot summer night."}
{"text":"Food : Came here for a birthday dinner, ordered one of the bestsellers on the menu, the Fried Chicken & I enjoyed my time here on a Saturday night. I was not too pleased with the selection of the main/appetizers, I felt limited to at least 1/2 main entrees, but it was worth the wait since the presentation and flavor of the Fried chicken was something that I haven't quite experienced.

Atmosphere:  Low-key, very chill with good music. 

Service: 3.5/5 

A great place to experience slightly better dining, good ambiance and somewhere to just spend time with friends. I liked how it an all in one place to dine and dance"}
{"text":"Super hip,  great food, good people. Amen. Come for brunch!"}
{"text":"Horrible staff. We arrived at the venue at 9:45PM on a Friday night with a party of 6. The downstairs hostess told us that the patio was first come first serve so we went upstairs right away. When we got to the hostess stand the hostess ignored us for a good 10 mins until she finally acknowledged us. She told us that she would seat us when the next table becomes avalaible but she didn't even write our names down. After 30 minutes of waiting and watched the hostess seat many guests that arrived AFTER us we finally confronted her. She told us that ALL those guests had \"reservations \" (which was told to us that the patio does not accept any reservations). We let it slide...We ended up seeing a table for 2 open (rest of party still had to stand around) sat down and ordered drinks. 20 mins in the hostess asked for the table back stating that they had to use the table for a reservation even though we asked the busser to ask the hostess prior to us sitting down if it was free. She insisted that if we weren't ordering food we would need to leave ( at this point we have already ordered over 100$ in drinks for this 2 person table) 
We asked to speak to a manager ( Matthew) whom himself told us that the patio could not be reserved when we told him we were on the wait list. He then later changed his story when he found out that the hostess seated other guests before us. The staff lie for each other. The manager himself said the last reservation was at 10pm when we spoke to him it was 10:50pm and he said that he would extend the reservation times incase the guests run late ( BUT he was the one who told us they didn't even take resevations for the patio) which contradicted everything he said. Don't go to this venue unless you're prepared to be waiting 2 hours for a table. They definitely don't respect you as guest."}
{"text":"No, we didn't have a meal there.  Nor did we stay in the hotel itself.  Yes, it's very lovely and very popular and very trendy and the band we saw there was very good.

But, um.  I have to tell you:   ... Worst. Martinis. Ever.  I mean, so weak that at first sip, I actually startled myself into thinking that maybe I had just drank from my glass of water.

No lie."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a few of my coworkers who are locals, and was told I would be pleased. I was! 
This multi-leveled restaurant/bar/lounge/dance club has an old glamour that you can tell it used to be exquisite, then dumped (the area is being revamped) due to the neighbourhood, then recently has regained his glam. It has a very sultry and alluring decor, which can be romantic, but not stuffy in any way. It is also just as appropriate to go there with friends or a girls night out, even colleagues (which was in my case.) 
Their wine list is pretty complete, and their martini list is full as well, although I had a pino grigio (coworkers!). The place was jam packed on a Friday night, but the servers and hostesses were very efficient in seating us. 
We had mostly just appetizers, but the cheeses and pates were phenominal. 
Afterwards, we went down to the \"Basement\" which I think turns into a club, but unfortunately was not starting yet. The bartenders were very friendly though and gave us each a free shot of one of his new concoctions. 
A good place to go on the weekend, but I would recommend to reserve a table beforehand."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch. Polite friendly wait staff and host was pleasant and apologized for the Sunday 20 min wait. Best to go before 11. Food was yummy place was retro Mid century modern cool chic. Surrounding Area of queen street west-west was great to walk and shop."}
{"text":"My quest for the best chicken and Waffles in Toronto started at the Drake and so far, nothing has been able to beat it.

We had a great view for our Sunday Brunch at the Sky Yard and the food was fantastic. My chicken and waffles was a great blend of sweet and savory and the eggs benedict was delicious."}
{"text":"\"Sister! I'm coming to Toronto!\" says she with the name of Miriam. 
\"Where are you staying?\" I ask.
\"The Drake!\" she enthuses.

I wasn't surprised that Miriam was staying at the Drake. After all, it's a hip, happening, very cool and unique boutique hotel in what many people call West of Queen West  - a neighbourhood well on its way to gentrification (for good or for bad). 

We rallied for dinner, coming from different parts of the city on a cold windy snowy night. We had choices - Julie's Cuban, Terroni, et al. But all of us opted to eat at the Drake. It was a good choice.

We certainly had lots of options - Winterlicious, Drake Specials and the Blue Plate Special. I opted for Thursday night's Blue Plate which was Chicken or Steak with Chocolate Cake. Steak please!

It came perfectly cooked, just the right portion of meat, rocket greens, frites and aioli on top. I partnered that with some butternut squash with 2 cheeses and it was mmmm mmmm good. $18 bucks for the main/dessert + $6 for the squash. The price was definitely right. The chocolate cake was a little dry on the edges and the icing. I must've gotten an end piece. But it was tasty. 

Service was attentive and anticipated our needs and had a sense of humour. Just as I was going to ask for something, our server came along and had it ready. Ambiance was hipster-y though not douche-y. Maybe it was too cold for the douches? 

I enjoyed myself immensely at the Drake. I hope Miriam enjoys her stay there. I'm sure she'll Yelp about it.

{"text":"I came here for brunch with two girlfriends, and had to wait about an hour to be seated. Once we were walked in by the hostess, we noticed that the entire bar area was empty, as were atleast 3 tables. What?!

The server took forever to come take our order, and we received our food at the same speed. The food was nothing short of average.

I would not recommend the Drake Hotel for brunch at all. Go to Mildred's Temple Kitchen (about a 15 walk from the Drake Hotel) for brunch instead."}
{"text":"Highly disappointing considering the prestige of the Drake Hotel in Toronto. 

This is a review on food alone
To be fair, there are other accommodations to this hotel such as daily and weekly events, the bar and a patio that viewers may want to look into

On food alone however, I don't recommend spending your time and money here for a meal when Toronto has so much more to offer else where 

I came with my partner on a Friday evening. The waitress sat us down in between 4 other people, when you can clearly see room for seating elsewhere. It's cool, I'll let that slide 

We ordered a dozen oysters, sashimi salad, soup of the day, clam chowder, the rotisserie chicken, artichoke dish and the pork belly roll 

The oysters were delicious! Probably the best part of the meal only. Sashimi salad was weak; not fresh at all. Soup of the day was mediocre and the clam chowder is the size of a Tim hortons chicken noodle soup ...... Lame. The chicken was OK, I did not enjoy the strong alcohol taste to the chicken 
- it could have been cooked soMe more to avoid this. Artichoke dish was pointless and the pork belly roll was nothing special. 

Portions are ridiculously small, over priced -- I didn't even get full! And the bill was $200.00 what ...?
I could have went to Canoe. Disappointing 

Drinks were also mediocre (Caesar and a 'woman under the influence') but quite the pretty penny 

Brownie points for the ambience but that's typical toronto vibes. 

Would not recommend. It is now squarely on the write off list, in terms of food"}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a group of 7 on a Sunday around 1130. Had to wait for a table for bout 30 mins. No big deal. However once we were seated we ordered food and hour after hour it still hadn't arrived. Server kept saying that it was just busy and he told the kitchen to hurry. Meanwhile people have come and gone all around us and we were the last ones there (seemingly) it was 330 pm and still no food. Many complaints were made by this time, my friend actually left and got a pizza and came back and our food STILL hadn't arrived. Not quite sure what ever did happen in the kitchen but our food came around 4pm (not even sure why we waited this long) and everyone was just angry. They ended up comping our food bill but not the drink bill that was exponentially LARGER than what it would have been if we had just gotten our food on time! It really was ridiculous. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Drake Café = Absolutely yummy! I ordered pancakes with wild blueberry drizzled over them and a bagel with whipped cream cheese. The best I've eaten in a long time! What a great place for a Sunday brunch. The server was great, even gave me an extra glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Patio was super cozy and tucked away from the busy street. The staff were super friendly, the service was fast. This is my new favourite spot for breakfast/brunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"This is the worst hotel in the Toronto. Never stay here. The rooms are small and uncomfortable and the noise from the bar is unbearable. It is an awful experience."}
{"text":"The Drake is a hotel, a bar, AND a music venue, located near Queen St. W and Dufferin in Toronto.

It's really far west along Queen West but not impossible to get to. Coming from Finch Station go to Osgoode Station and take the 501 Westbound Streetcar, get off at Dovercourt and it's right there. 

Being from Toronto I've never had the need to spend a night here. For some people spending a night here after a show maybe ideal. The hotel looks clean and well maintained from what I've seen. 

This review will focus solely on the bar & music venue, which I've been to a few times. 

The venue part is intimate, with a capacity of about 200. The Drake has a variety of programming from stand up comedy, to touring bands to local Toronto bands. Tickets for these shows are also relatively cheap, usually under $20. The venue and bar space are nice with great beers on tap including local favorites Mill St. Organic & Beau's Lug Tread. 

There is even a Sky Bar, a beautiful patio upstairs with the same beer on tap. 

I'd definitely come to the Drake for a show but only for a band I really wanted to see"}
{"text":"A little late in writing my review but here goes.  My friend and I came here for the Poetry Slam that they hold in the Underground (one or two Sundays a month) and decided to also have dinner here before the show.

Luckily since we were only 2 people we got in pretty quickly without a reservation, but it did fill up fast.  Make a reservation if you really want to come here for dinner.

While having dinner there was also a live \"show\" - some sort of comedy/music thing going on.  I think different nights have different things going on so if you are looking for someplace quiet then this place might not fit the bill.

The Underground is...underground..lol.  This is where the shows, concerts, poetry slams etc happen.  It's small, but there are tables and a bar down there."}
{"text":"One of the NICE things about places serving twenty dollar burgers... Service is good. I was treated very well, purposely coming before PEAK hours.
Excellent Americano."}
{"text":"The best brunch in the city! Love the warm scone plate and the eggs Benny. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm a little mixed about this place. Coming on a saturday night, being told that the lounge opens at 10pm, the bouncer told us a private party was happening until 10:30 so we thought it was only right not to stand in the front loitering around. Little did I know that within 15 minutes, there was a line up of 20 people down the street, just a couple minutes after the 10:30 mark. If someone had told me that there was a line forming, then I probably would have hung around.

Finally getting into the lounge, up the stairs to find some seats, I was once again asked to leave where I was because the entire area was reserved, but it clearly wasn't stated that way as I only saw one reserved sign. 

We finally finally found a few seats on the patio, luckily not too chilly, and warmed with heat lamps.. I enjoyed my friend's company as the people smoked heavily around us... but what can you do on a patio. 

With a giant lit sign stating best cocktails 2011, you would hope that the drinks would be top knotch! Loving pears, the pear cocktail was really a no brainer... too bad it was way too sweet, full of puree and not really crafty at all. I tried a second cocktail, the peppered one, which had a really unique taste, and a bit if a peppery kick. I was surprised to like this one better than the first, but I still would not consider it one of the best in the city. There were special beer cocktails listed, but when I attempted to ordered one, I was told that they were not serving them, which I found to be quite odd, because their options were written all along the ceiling walls, so why would they tempt me with beer and absinthe if it wasn't available to me!!!!

By the time we left, I was shocked to see the amount of people in the downstairs lounge area. You would not even move and getting out was quite a struggle.. it was like finding a crack in the wall to slither through.

There was a $2 photobooth that we had to take advantage of, and believe it, it was tempermental. We put in two rounds of photos and they never came out... super disappointed but luckily, we talked to the concierge and she checked the machine and TADA!!!!!!!!!!! the photo  booth was playing tricks with us. Thank goodness it all worked out in the end.

I definitely think this place has a cool vibe.. would love to come back, but not to be suffocated."}
{"text":"I hosted another happy hour here for my meetup group. We scored coming in on a Wednesday! Our group of 8 sat in the large communal table, ordered our drinks and ate a lot of half price sushi (part of the Apres Dinner happy hour).

Arriving at 6pm guaranteed us a table, excellent service and full enjoyment of the sushi. As always, I stuck to the salmon maki. It was a good.

A good time was had by all."}
{"text":"I have so much love for the Drake. When I visit Toronto (from LA) for work, it's my #1 choice for lodging, food and drink, hands down. I personally love the crash pad rooms for how they marry efficiency with style. Jonathan and his team always take excellent care of me and mine, from booking through check-out, making work trips feel like play every single time. Thank you and see you all again SOON!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go for a Sunday brunch and it definitely was a good decision. 
We ordered the Drake breakfast, Drake Benny and two coffees (Americano and coconut latte, which was DELICIOUS). 
The Drake breakfast would be your most traditional style brunch, while the Benny adds a little bit of a twist to it. 
If you're looking for a consistent brunch, I wouldn't say it's the place to go. Given the portions and also the fact that is not anything special, the price was a little steep. But personally, as an experience, the presentation, the service, the ambience of the restaurant and the food itself, it's TOTALLY worth it, at least once."}
{"text":"This hotel/bar/lounge could be transplanted smack in the middle of Williamsburg and it would be full every night. Depending on who you are this is either a good thing or a bad thing.  Regardless of the hipsters I had a good time at the Drake.

Walked in around 8pm on a Saturday night for dinner at the lounge which was not very full. Clearly this place is all about the drinks, but the dinner was excellent as well.

I like the design of the lounge, and the curve couches that ran the length of the front area. 

For drinks to start I had the White Sangria which was excellent.  I also tried the red which was good as well.  It was Summerlicious (their version of Restaurant Week) so I did the 3 courses for $35.  I had a salad to start and a steak entre on a bed of vegatables that was delicious. Finally I had a blueberry and bourbon cake for dessert that was excellent.

Our server was excllent and even offer to take us up ahead of the line to the main attraction at the Drake, the rooftop bar!  We went up and had a few drinks on the perfect night. 

If I were ever in Toronto agian this would be a must stop for me!"}
{"text":"Sub-par and overpriced food. Tried 3 sharing plates; the squash arrived luke warm and without much flavour, the kung pow chicken was just regular fried chicken without any \"pow\", and the queso fundido is essentially grease served with stale garlic bread. They try and redeem themselves in their poetic service.... \"a splash of feta on your dish sir!\""}
{"text":"Alrighty this is for the food but not as an arts venue.  
Food 3***
Arts Venue 4****

The food at the Drake is not bad but I do expect the flavour and execution of the basics like a pancake to be much better especially since it is more expensive than the other spots around it - and those other spots are pretty good.

My favourite thing on the menu is the Drake breakfast because everything tastes so good on the plate and it came with sourdough which is to me the best bread.

My friends weren't too thrilled with their dishes. The pancakes weren't fluffy and on the dry side with syrup helping only a little.

The spiced latte... not very flavourful. I was much happier with the London fog latte! 

I will say atmosphere and customer service are amazing! From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave. One of the reasons it's a great spot to go.

As an arts venue on a weekend, this place is nuts and the later it is in the evening the more people there are loitering outside the hotel. Must be noisy if you are staying there.

Food - give it a try.  The service will make up for anything. Plus if you any issue they make a point of fixing it."}
{"text":"This place is better then the Gladstone down the street for brunch. They switch up the menu and use high quality ingredients. 

The patio outside has a wasp problem that lowered the score from 5 to a 4

{"text":"One of the signs that Parkdale is trying to clean itself up is the Drake Hotel.  Having gone through a severe renovation that now makes it a boutique hotel in the heart of one of Toronto's not-as-seedy-as-it-used-to-be neighbourhoods, the hotel provides not only rooms, but fine dining, a lounge, and a performance venue where alternative bands and comedy acts take the stage downstairs.

Done over in Art Deco, the Drake is a throwback to yesteryear, where gentlemen and ladies would come to dine, drink, and dance the night away, where bartenders, bands, and cigarette girls would cater to your every whim.  It's this feeling that they've captured completely from the design, the layout, and the furniture.  The drinks lounge is spacious and dark, candle-lit and dripping with cool.  Once downstairs, that's where the stage is where many bands and comedy acts have performed.  Not just local acts have hit the stage, but also the likes of The Killers, Wolfmother, and Beck.

Not bad for an old hotel in a slummy area of town.  Go in.  Enjoy a drink.  Relax."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with girlfriends on Sunday morning. Waited for about 20 minutes before being seated. We all ordered the eggs bennys but were not blown away. It's not a bad place for brunch, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"My fiance and I stayed in a crash pad a couple of nights in May and were very pleased.  Its small (as the name implies) but with lots of character. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and we enjoyed getting breakfast and meeting up for drinks with friends at the cafe. Its definitely not the cheapest place to stay in town, but I'd have to say it was worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Very nice and cute boutique hotel! The food at the SkyBar was SO delicious and the staff is very very friendly! The rooms (crash pad) are small but cozy and very comfy!
Loved the atmosphere. The cafe is also so nice to have breakfast!
I would go back!"}
{"text":"The Drake Hotel is just one of those hotels where you have to appreciate all the little details that go into the decor and branding of the hotel. For any of y'all who are into art and culture, then The Drake Hotel is smack dab in it all.

Not only do you get a discount at their art-oriented store (THEY SELL CHAMPION!) but they feature so many great pieces of art around.

They have quite a few bars spread throughout the property and a few are a tad hidden. Have to admit though that's half the fun of them!

I have to forewarn you like in any major city the hotel rooms are very small but one should expect that. I really like how dark the rooms are and that little doll is so freaking cool. Just expect a $75 price tag on it though if you want to take it home.

If you're concerned about the bed not being comfortable then no need to worry! The bed is like a bunch of puppies holding you above ground. They also provide sleep masks which was definitely used.

Now the bathroom was literally in front of the bed so if you're alone or with your significant other it's no big deal; however, if you might be with a friend then I suggest you take a glance at which room you book. This wasn't an issue for me but I do think it's worth noting.

The toiletries were life though! I really wanted to just pack them up in my luggage haha.

Truly had a great stay here and by golly was the customer service superb. They not only remember you but are always willing to help. Every time I walked through the door they were always with a smile.

For those of you who are workout junkies let the front desk know as they have vouchers for a gym nearby at no charge."}
{"text":"\"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"  
--The Yelp description for a 2 star review is spot on here.

I've been to the Drake twice for brunch and once for drinks.  It's definitely a buzzing and popular west-end spot.  You can pretty much count on a line to get in.

The FOOD (2 stars):  I've tried two dishes here for brunch.  The first time I got the traditional eggs Benedict ($15).  The dish came out a bit cool temperature-wise.  Most of the components, especially the egg and hollandaise sauce tasted as if they had been sitting around for a while.  Plating was pretty careless and it didn't look visually especially appealing.

Round 2 brought the chicken and waffles ($16).  The chicken was fairly tasty, a bit overdone in places.  The waffles were soggy though.  And where was the creme fraiche that was promised on the menu?  Somewhere back in the kitchen I think!  

The DRINKS:  Brunch caesars are expensive ($11) and fairly small.  Nothing pickled as garnish...not nearly a match for Tequila Bookworm's excellent caesars.  I came for drinks one evening.  The waitress didn't give us a menu, which looking at their website means I missed out on what sound like interesting cocktails.  The beer list, however, is unimpressive.  When \"Alexander Keith's\" and \"Budweiser Shock Top\" are your \"premium\" beers, we're in trouble.

The SERVICE:  \"Disdain\" would be the word I'd use to describe the way the servers interacted with me on all 3 visits.  If I could get his or her attention, they looked rather put-out that a customer had a request.  Plates were dropped off with as little care as possible to keep the food still on the plate.  The waitress for drinks seemed awfully put out that we asked her to recite the beer list when she didn't bring us a menu.

OVERALL, I don't think I'll be back.  I've given them 3 tries.  This place has a lot of buzz and is definitely popular, so they won't be hurting for customers...plenty of other places to try nearby."}
{"text":"My experience going to this bar on a quite Monday night was a total gong show.  The service was terrible; we were juggled between three different servers, who couldn't seem to take and carry through on the drink orders of a party of three in any competent way.  I can understand some gaps in service when the bar is busy, or if one person has to leave at the end of his/her shift.  As far as I could tell, the servers were just hanging out and shooting the shit with each other.  Blegh.  Too hipster, not good quality."}
{"text":"The Drake Hotel is a decent place. The thing that really stand out for me is their upstairs patio. It's great for summer evenings. The drink prices are just above average in cost. I had one great experience for a friends going away party as it was busy and the music was flowing. The second experience I had made me reconsider the consistency of the establishment. The business was not even busy at all that evening and we paid cover on the long weekend of a Sunday evening. My friends and I were not impressed. Since it was so dead, we ended up bar hopping after the Drake Hotel. Overall not a such a big hype. I may come back to see if my mind changes about this venue. Until the next time! JImStar Bee!!"}
{"text":"3.5---Went and had dinner at the drake hotel last night. Their decor is cool and hip. Lots of drinks, a touch pricier than your average bar ($15 average). I ordered their chopped steak. It is their sirloin steak chopped up with vegetables such a king oyster mushrooms, kale and cherry tomatoes. The chopped steak was also topped with foie gras. Melt in your mouth delicious. The only down sides were that the steak was chopped into very small pieces and the kale was over salted. I did have a taste of my friends duck breast, I found that delicious. Perfectly medium rare inside with a great outer crust.  I was also hoping to get some dancing in as well however the music didn't really start and by 11pm. Perhaps the last time that I came was a bit later. This restaurant also has a great patio. I would recommend getting to the restaurant earlier if you are looking for a spot there! Overall, nothing wowed me but nothing was horrible as well."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with my hubby... Manager Grace was so sweet. The blueberry scones are AMAZING!!!! I had the omelette which was pretty good.. My husband had the burger which he enjoyed as well (and they make it in house)."}
{"text":"I love the lounge at the Drake. The staff is upbeat and friendly. The DJ is phenomenal. I couldn't stop dancing. It was an excellent night."}
{"text":"I have no problem admitting that I sort of begged to be included on a sales trip to Toronto.  Luckily, I was approved for the voyage, at which point my manager eagerly advised me to stay at the Drake Hotel.  He insisted that it was THE trendy hot spot in town and that its bar was even frequented by locals.  Although he yearned to book there himself, he was dedicated to his hotel rewards program and decided to live vicariously through my stay instead.  I perused the website and loved that the hotel offered comedy performances, trivia nights, and more.  It really was a unique boutique hotel, so I agreed to book there.  

Upon my arrival, the courteous front desk quickly checked me in and had my bags ferreted up the steep staircase to my quarters on the third floor.  The staff was additionally helpful when I needed advice on navigating the area, locating enjoyable running trails, etc.  

The lobby was dimly lit and decorated like a Hard Rock Hotel with a young, artsy feel.  My room was also rather funky, though not in my taste.  The \"closet\" was an open bar hanging along one wall.  The bathroom was completely open and made up another wall of the actual room.  In other words, the toilet, shower, and sink area were all in the bedroom itself rather than in a separate alcove.  The washroom facilities were divided into three sections with the toilet on the left, shower in the middle, and sink on the right.  In order to wash your hands after using the facilities, you had to step back down into the main room, walk around the shower, and climb back up in front of the vanity.  It was inconvenient and just plain strange.  This would not be an appropriate location for vacationing with friends.  I will confirm that it was very clean though.

I did not utilize the amenities and cannot comment on them except to say that the garden area was delightful and crowded during the evenings.  In regards to the location, the hotel was at the very end of the hipster section of Queen Street.  Heading one block towards the Downtown area, you would find great restaurants and cool boutiques.  However, wandering in the other direction displayed a less desirable section of Queen Street, upon which many homeless people lingered.  The residential areas beyond the main drag were fine, but provided little need to a tourist.  Lastly, my colleagues were staying downtown, which was actually a substantial cab ride from this hotel.  

While the Drake might have been an \"It Spot\", it did not provide satisfying accommodations for a business traveler.  I would not recommend it for anyone, except perhaps young single or couples on personal vacations."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday, and they were quite accommodating when it came to seating as we arrived at that awkward period between meals.  The staff were friendly and service was great.  We opted to order all share plates and really enjoyed ourselves - the queso fundido was amazing!  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Attended a friend's champagne birthday party yesterday as it coincided with the weekend Halloween parties that was going on. While the server was nice, the hors d'oeuvres were bland and uninspiring; especially the rice paper vegetable wraps. Ordered the Farmer's Market punch which tasted overly sweet--this costed $8 and I do not recommend it.

My main complaints were the cleanliness of the upstairs washrooms and the patrons using it. There were 2 unisex bathrooms and 1 urinal. It was around 10:30pm that I had queued up to use it. I was grossed out to witness a young couple; a playboy bunny girl and a guy in a sequin suit casually walk out of one of the small bathrooms that were the size of a mini broom closet together. My first thoughts were \"HOW?!\" followed by \"WTF?\" and then \"How bold!\"

Perhaps you may ask why I did not leave to find another bathroom? Well, I tried the downstairs one by the restaurant first, it was crowded with ladies in the most provocative outfits getting dolled up for the evening on the dance floor--it was suggested by hostess at the door to use the one upstairs; terrible mistake. Anyway, by the time the couple had come out, I was desperate so I mustered all my courage and went on it. 

HOLY CRAP! It looked like some violent \"courtship\" went down. Toilet paper everywhere, puddles of human \"you-know-what\" was here and there. The trash can was also knocked over. Honestly, my question was still \"HOW?!\"

Used a paper towel as a shield so that I don't touch the flush, faucet, as well as doorknobs with my bare hands and contract any diseases.

All that to say, while The Drake cannot control what their patrons do in the washrooms, it would be much appreciated if they could periodically clean the washrooms to ensure optimal cleanliness for all customers to enjoy a lovely evening party. Having witness the 2 sides of the Drake 1. Historical & Trendy 2. Trashy & chaotic, the latter is very strong in my mind. Don't think I'll be returning here anymore.

Also, to the young couples who were using the washrooms as a \"shake shack,\" you could have rented a nice room upstairs instead of making memories in a dirrrty washroom. To all the boys and girls reading this, you're all worth more than a dirty broom closet bathroom!!! Don't settle for anything less than a hotel room!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had.  The drake burger is made with high quality beef, cooked to a perfect medium.  The flavors are a true symphony.  The beet and blue salad made a perfect accompaniment."}
{"text":"Usually I absolutely love the drake (for their underground events and patio at night) so this review is JUST FOR THE BRUNCH. There's nothing worse than a disappointing brunch!

The service was painfully slow, we waited 50 minutes for our food and 15 minutes to get the cheque. 
The food wasn't even worth the wait, it was bland, portions were small (except for the chicken and waffles-which is average tasting) and SO overpriced. 
There was also really noisy music playing that really didn't suit a Sunday morning atmosphere.

Really didn't enjoy my time here this morning, neither did any of my friends. We went in excited and left annoyed.

service: 4/10
food: 5/10
pricing: 3/10 ($25 meal worth $12 max)
ambience: 8/10 (i love the drake's patio)

I'm pretty sure I'll come back to the Drake, just NEVER again for brunch."}
{"text":"this review is with respect to the lounge/club on the ground floor. 

i've been to the drake several times. on some occasions, the club plays more hip-hop/top40/house music. on these particular nights, the place is really great and everyone is partying. the dance floor is large and despite the tons of people, i don't feel lake a sardine. on other nights, the dj plays new rock/retro music, which i find particularly disappointing.

i figure the problem isn't so much the music itself, but the complete flip in genres. i prefer to have a club/lounge that stays consistent. when the drake constantly switches music and crowds, i find it less enjoyable to go. that's why i gave this place 3/5 stars. just the web site or call in advance to see what they will be playing on a night you're thinking of going."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Drake. I was thrilled! Young hipster crowd. One of the most atmospheric places I've stayed. The staff was very friendly and 100% customer focused. The room was small but eclectic .
The decor takes you to a whole other level, euro, modern, Warholish. Love Love loved it! Even at 2:30 in the morning, full of life. Viva la Drake !!"}
{"text":"This review was for the lounge on the Thursday night. If you love live music this is the place to go. It was packed with a 40 plus crowd. To bad I'm in the mid 30 crowd. The drink menu seemed speak easy type but the bartender wasn't super friendly so we never ordered and we just walked out."}
{"text":"We went here for the brunch based on our concierge's advice that it was the hottest brunch in town. We were very disappointed. The servers were unprofessional and the food took 50mins to come out. Instead of an apology, our waitress corrected me that it wasn't one hour and it was 50mins. The Bloody Mary (Caesar) was great, everything else was below average. Weak."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner with friends. I don't get what the hype is about?. Seemed very pub-ish with a cozy feeling. People were dressed very casual. Ambience was eh okay..

I think I was under the wrong impression clearly.. as I thought it was more of an upscale modern place.

We were given the booth seat towards the back next to the window. I was very cold all night and had to stuff more pillows behind me to block the draft coming in from outside. Not a good feeling while dining.

I ordered the green salad and the squash hummus. Presentation was beautiful, but both tasted extremely awful. I didn't really get the salad? The concoction of different things thrown in it like side apple slices and avocado and nuts and strange tasting dressing.

The hummus was not my cup of tea and I'm a person who literally eats hummus and pita daily, so I don't know what happened with this item. Maybe it was the squash infused in it that wasn't resonating with me?

Three other people at our table ordered the burger which looked great. I think that would be the best option if I ever return.

I give my rating three stars because our server was very friendly and attentive. Always had a smile on his face and never made us feel rushed to leave.

Would I return? Probably not. Not my type of atmosphere, but that doesn't mean that you won't like it."}
{"text":"VERY cool hotel in the West Queen West hood of Toronto. Very hip, artsy hotel property with a cafe, lounge, and rooftop bar all serving the same great menu. There is art around every corner and they seem to rotate some of the installations often. There is no elevator on property, so keep that in mind if stairs are an issue for your party. 

Location: West Queen West is the place to be for travelers like me who just like to wander, eat good food, drink, and pop into near shops. This hood is perfect for just that. Within walking distance to Chinatown, Little Portugal, Little Italy, Ossington, and TON of restaurants, bars, and shops line the streets. If you like art, food, and drinks, this is your hood. 

Rooms: So hip and cool. Love the organization of the rooms with the luggage racks and cool doll that is on every bed. Complementary champagne was in our room when we arrived (yes!). No coffeemaker in the room, but they offer complementary coffee and tea to all hotel guests in the cafe downstairs. Although I did not partake in the mini bar, they have great wine and booze options and excellent snack choices (think cheese puffs and gummy bears). For those interested, there is also a \"pleasure menu\" in every room and a curated DVD list for those that just want a movie night. I will say the bathroom is a little odd. The room is small and the bathroom is not closed off. There is a frosted glass door that blocks the toilet area or can be slid over the glass shower door for privacy, but in general, the bathroom is front and center in the room. Perhaps not the best choice for non-romantic couples or anyone who is rather shy. We had a couple of broken items in our room- two burnt out light bulbs and a non-working bathroom fan. Not a huge deal but the staff could pay closer attention to those items when prepping a room for guests. 

Food: Pretty great. The cafe has a nice brunch menu and solid coffee and tea options. They also have great grab and go pastries that are made daily. The Lounge area is very chill and nice and the rooftop bar is excellent. 

The Drake is definitely my recommendation for accommodations in Toronto. A great experience!"}
{"text":"Had a great date night there.  My suggestion is to oder a few small things as they are all amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here late Sunday morning and was pleasantly surprised when we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Inside of the cafe is super cute. Service was attentive and efficient. We both opted for some fancy coffee drinks which were delicious (burnt marshmallow and horchata lattes). Also had the chicken and waffles which were super tasty. The waffles were savoury and went well with the sweet cherries and whipped cream served with the chicken. Just the right amount of decadence. Only critique was the dish came out lukewarm. Would return however."}
{"text":"Can't believe that I have never came here before until now.. Geez i've been missing out!! It is a bit far depending on where you live. Drake hotel is pretty lit 7 days a week, there is always something new happening at this place which keeps this place interesting and fun. 

I came here on on the night they were having an indian curry battle! Got to try 5 different kinds of curry's from local restaurants around the city. I love these food battles considering that the food is all free for people to try and the food battles are always different. Heard they usually host these free food events on Monday evenings, which is pretty good considering its the beginning of the week and slower days. But depending on what sort of food it is, it can get quite busy. Luckily this past Monday was after the ice storm so weather wise many people didn't come due to poor weather which was better for crowds. 

Drake Hotel has also very good food as well, no shortage of alcohol drinks. Lots of variety of cocktails and beers. I didn't get to experience too much of their food as I was mainly here for their food battle instead. Only thing I got to try was the Drake truffle fries which was very tasty. Cool, hipster place to come with friends. The place gets pretty busy and packed on a daily basis, best to come early and occupy a table especially during food battles."}
{"text":"The Drake a Hotel was a great stop on our Queen West artsy tour; one we cobbled together from Lonely Planet suggestions. 

We snagged a seat at the rooftop bar where we enjoyed cocktails inspired by mixologist from all over the U.S. and Canada. Being form Kentucky, I tried their take on an old fashioned - brown butter infused bourbon with mole bitters and maple syrup. Yum! 

You can tell this is high-end cocktail bar not only by the menu and $15 cocktails, but their big, clear ice cubes. May sound silly, but if you enjoy a good cocktail, you know what I mean. 

While prices were steep, the scene was funky and lively and I'd definitely check it out. We just missed the band, so you know the night was only going to get better!"}
{"text":"Came to the patio to drink and it was super beautiful. Even though it was a little cooler, the patio is warmed with heaters and they have adorable lights that make the whole place cozy. There is also a lot of semi indoor seating too if you'd like to be outside adjacent in cozy cushions. 

Ordered the sangria and it was good. Not a lot of fruit and a lot of ice though. And quite pricey...but it is the Drake, so that's not so surprising. 

I'd come back for the atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"The two times I've been here have both been for brunch. Once I came here on a summer afternoon and sat outside in the patio and enjoyed the chicken and waffles which I thought were superb. This time we sat indoors and I had the eggs benedict and it was one of the BEST egg benedicts I have had. Hollandaise sauce was great, eggs were perfect, ham was delicious and so was the brioche toast underneath. I also loved the blueberry scones with preserve. Service is super friendly, the vibe both indoors and outdoors is amazing. Highly recommended for brunch!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get friends together and have some grub!

VENUE
The ladies and I went out to celebrate a birthday.  We had a nice cozy area near the fireplace. We thought it might be too hot but it was just perfect.  

I really liked the art work on the wall.

FOOD
We had a couple pitchers of white sangria and some food.  The sangria was very nice although initially I thought they put way too much ice in the pitcher and glasses. 

I have to say though, the food portions are small. You would think you could share the nachos with the whole table but I would say you could only share with maybe one other person. I really liked the mac and cheese but I don't know if I would pay that much compared to something I equally like out of a box, and an 1/8 of the price. ha. I'm paying for the ambiance. I know.

CLUB
The room changed to a dance club. The music at the beginning of the night was 70's and 80's so unless you liked that stuff, you were a bit bored.  You could request songs but the DJ wasn't very pleasant when you went to ask. By the end of the night, they songs turned into top 40.  

I had a great night that evening and think it's a fantastic place for a group of friends."}
{"text":"Great eggs benny.  Chicken and waffles - the whipped butter makes it all so good.  But the COFFEE.  It's not very good."}
{"text":"We checked out the rooftop patio for cocktails on a Sunday afternoon.  The hostess seemed entirely apathetic, the decor tired, the white sangria overly sweet, and the ceasars better looking than they tasted.  We won't return."}
{"text":"Can I start off by saying I take no pleasure in leaving crappy reviews for venues? It annoys me, but I do it for the people and I'm here you to tell you for the love of god, don't order their pavlova. 

I really don't even know what the heck they did to make it taste so brutesque. Maybe I've just been ordering pavlova at all the fanciest joints in town, but seriously, it offended my taste buds. OFFENDED. I made that face Gordan Ramsey makes after eating virtually anything that isn't a 5/5 or a 10/10 or a perfect score of some sort.

With that said the rest of their food isn't that good either, but their service is nice and their music scene is pretty wicked so maybe go for drinks and a night of dancing, but get your food pre-game on elsewhere."}
{"text":"At brunch if you order a side salad you will receive a $6.00 teacup-sized bowl of eight leaves with some balsamic dressing and a sprinkling of sesame seeds.  I would just question why they would use the teacup measurements.  I would just question their use of measurement.  It seems unfair.  We have a reasonable expectation of a side salad.  This wasn't reasonable.  I was able to, when eating, stab all the leaves in one go.  Again, this is unreasonable.  If I wanted to, I could have eaten them all in one go.  I see that they want to fancy it up with sesame seeds but really they are hiding the fact that there are only eight leaves."}
{"text":"They have such a great outdoor patio! Perfect for spending a lazy Saturday afternoon drinking your stress away. 

Our waiter went out of his way to make us the perfect Caesar! I'd never tried a caesar before and he asked a lot of questions to make sure we'd enjoy our first experience. Unfortunately we only had drinks so that is all I can comment upon.

Service was excellent and attentive and the location made for great people watching :)"}
{"text":"Great patio, live music, food (sushi/brunch especially) and drinks. Love their Monday nights! Always have different evens running. 
Wasn't blown away  by the tuna and white bean salad, portion was smaller and I found the ingredients a bit random especially the tomato paste but I did love the crispy capers."}
{"text":"I've been to the Drake a few times in the past for Summerlicious and Winterlicious events and although the food was good, I didn't think it was good enough to justify the price.  Value is really important to me.  My more recent experiences at the Drake Hotel was much better.  One of my more recent visits was for a snack and their braised beef with mustard was delicious!

The most recent visit to the Drake Hotel was for brunch with a group of ~20 people and I was really impressed at how well they handled the large group.  I was also really impressed that they took brunch reservations.  I find that few places in Toronto do brunch reservations.  Their brunch portions were small, but delicious.  I would recommend the chicken and waffles if you want to try something different.

I would definitely go back to the Drake Hotel for brunch, especially now that I know that they take reservations."}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent, very hipster/queen street vibe. Brunch is also pretty decent."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my girlfriends for late dinner and food was fantastic. Great crowd and music. Been there for dancing before to and overall great spot for dinner and drinks. Recommend this place for a good time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Sunday for an iced coffee. Just about everywhere else except starbucks wasn't open yet. I ordered an iced coffee and an iced mocha. I am so used to iced coffee just being drip coffee poured over ice... I have gotten so used to that being the norm, I had nearly given up on them totally. Here at the Drake my confidence was restored in what an iced coffee is and should be. Espresso shaken in a cocktail mixer with ice and poured into a glass. Drake, thank you for making my Sunday morning in Toronto great. The mocha on the other hand wasn't amazing, it was made the same way but lacked the sweetness you usually find in a mocha.

I didn't try the food but I saw a few things come out of the the kitchen that looked tasty."}
{"text":"The Drake can be such a fun time but it's really hit or miss.  If you love good hip-hop sets check out the basement room on Fridays (most Fridays).  The top patio level gets too rammed on Saturdays so good luck with that.  I tend to end up here on Fridays as a semi-last resort; on Saturdays I would rather go elsewhere... only because there's better places (honestly not shooting down the Drake or anything like that)

      This place certainly gets an A for effort with Labatt 50 on draught, atmosphere and guest DJs.  The crowd is somewhat Yuppish but very easy going.  Most people should at least try this place out at some point in their \"going out phase\""}
{"text":"The first time I came here was in December and it was for a work Christmas party and everything was great which is why I returned so now onto my actually review of my experience yesterday (February 5th).

Came here for my 19th Birthday with a group of 6 and I have to say we had the most miserable excuse of a waitress to start the night. I can see what other reviews are complaining about because she was just flat out cranky there are a lot of coffee shops in the area if she needed a caffeine fix but don't take it out on paying customers especially in a group because you're ruining your chance at repeat business from all those in the group and their friends in the future. 

We got here at around 9:30 and we were seated in the north lounge area. We planned on just having appetizers and drinks not a meal. The waitress asked if we wanted a meal and we said no that we just wanted appetizers and drinks and that's when she took a turn for the worst. I have to say she had to have been the rudest waitress I've had to deal with in my life.

We ordered a few orders of fancy fries and a round of drinks to start some people in our group ordered beer and the rest ordered cocktails. We enjoyed our drinks and fries. As soon as we finished our fries the waitress comes over and places the bill on the table. We didn't ask for a bill we were still going to order more. Honestly the worst customer service any of us has ever received. We paid then we went to the upper bar/ lounge area the staff up there seemed better and more welcoming. The roof top patio looks like it would be really nice in the summer months. We just went with bar service up there and the bartender was really nice and friendly as well a quick he was easily able to handle all the customers without seeming confused or over welmed.

Lastly we went to the lower bar or drake underground area which I can see being a lot of fun when a good bands in unfortunately when we were there it was DJs on stage and they were playing the crappyiest music. I heard the top 40 and some older songs from the early 2000s all in all the music was craptastic and not what I expected.

I honestly cannot see myself returning as I rather go to the Rivoli or the Gladstone where they play better music. I mean I've always wanted to go to the drake so I'm glad I did but it's honestly not what I expected and I'm extremely disappointed especially by the service since that's in excusable.

FYI: Coat check is $3 which is reasonable"}
{"text":"Disastrous evening at The Drake! 

I called in during the day to make a reservation for their Wednesday trivia night, and was told that all the reservable tables were booked but that a number are held for walk-ins, so I should come in at 7:30 (trivia starts at 8). I came in at 7:15, was told that there were absolutely no tables available, but that some patrons were finishing up their dinner so I could put my group down on their wait list and they would text me when a table opened up. I waited inside the lobby for 30 minutes, and went over to check on the progress, only to be told that the wait list wasn't moving at all as everyone that had arrived had reservations. I should add that these \"reservations\" seemed to consist mostly of groups being asked if they had made a reservation, them answering \"yes\", and then them being whisked to a table without any name or other information being given. 

So at this point I sensed defeat and asked if there was any room upstairs (not in the trivia area) for us to eat, and was told to \"go upstairs and check\". Upstairs, I waited another 15 minutes for the servers to figure out if there was any space, and while they were definitely doing their best to accommodate us, they had to keep checking downstairs with the \"host\" (who was presumably the same employee who had told me to try my luck upstairs) to see if an empty table had been booked. Guess what? It was. 

So 45 minutes later, right at 8pm as the trivia night was starting, we went back downstairs to check one last time about a potential table, and was told \"there is no availability at all, you aren't getting a table tonight\". We left, and went across the street to the Beaconsfield (excellent, fast service, by the way!). 

Then...then I got a text at 8:09pm saying \"your table is ready at The Drake Hotel, please return to the host stand\". We had already placed our orders at the Beaconsfield. Good God, people!

We were never told a wait time, we watched countless \"reservations\" slip past us without any checking them off a reservation list, and at no point were assisted in any way. We were, in fact, turned away from the establishment less than 10 minutes before our table was ready. 

Moral of the story: if you don't have a reservation at The Drake; lie."}
{"text":"Enjoying this hotel requires an open mind that loves an eclectic boho style.  Rooms feel european in style and size as it's an older small remodeled hotel with two great bars.  If you are expecting it to be proper and gentlemanly like the Drake in Chicago or a Marriott you are going to in for a surprise that you will either love or hate.  They don't have an elevator but they are more than happy to carry your bags up the stairs to your room right as you arrive.

Outside the window in the hallway by my room I could see an artistic garden of 'stuffed' animals like teddy bears but made out of cement.  It felt a bit like modern street art.  Throughout the hotel you'll find interesting pieces of art mixed with vintage lighting and wallpaper. Enter your cozy hotel room and you won't be alone as a handmade stuffed doll with a hairy chest will be waiting next to the bed which was quite comfortable.

Lot's of cheeky touches with a pleasure menu in your room that will cost you $100 if you slip it in your bag.  You are able to order breakfast in your room. and I believe there is a diner attached but I didn't have a need to you there.    If you are sharing the room and prefer privacy when using the bathroom you might see if they have a room where the bathroom is separate.  In my room the sink was part of the room and the shower and toilet were just enclosed with frosted glass.  I was traveling alone on business so didn't mind.

The bars were hopping with well crafted cocktails and lots of spaces to gather.  My favorite was on the upstairs patio where they have a bonfire, and tables covered with open tents.  It feels a bit like a young hip group of mounties setup camp there.
Downstairs each night there was a band playing and everyone was having a good time.  Take a walk around the bar and look at all the artwork and decor as you are sure to discover a few surprises.

The staff was nice and helpful.  If you have a minute stop by the boutique next door - you get 10% off if you stay in the hotel.  Good place if you are looking for unusual gifts.

The Drake is now on my list of the most eclectic and trendy hotels to stay in.  It's not for everyone but if you are up for an artsy urban hotel experience put the Drake on your next Toronto itinerary.  I personally liked it and found my stay cozy and fun."}
{"text":"Went back and the hamburger is still A-OK and the fries are not greasy or oily.
Atmosphere is unique and not generic like elsewhere.
The restaurant is cool, but the waiter did not have a snobby attitude.
If the prices were a little lower it would be perfect, but other than that 4/5. 
Stay cool"}
{"text":"Nice location, friendly staff. Way too hipster for anybody's good: having some kitschy buyables in the rooms clearly more important than making sure there's no mould in the shower. Window shades not near dark enough for me (I'm not fond of light in the AM when I travel). 

Had breakfast in the café a couple of times. Food quite good but not brilliant. Lovely-looking espresso machine behind the bar but no competent barista (at least mine wasn't: terrible double shot). Mentioned on twitter that it sucked and got the response that they'd \"be in touch soon\" - now it's six months later (is that soon, somewhere?). Anyway if you need a shot in Trinity-Bellwoods head to Crafted on Ossington."}
{"text":"Beautiful terrace rooftop patio day/ night. Excellent boozy brunch spot, great service and cute decor."}
{"text":"I highly recommend their seafood Sunday which is only once a month. check their website for the schedule. It was $35/person i believe. What you get is a nice full meal that starts off with a salad, bread and organic beer. Then the main course comes which is dumped on a large table with a plastic cloth which you will help yourself to. It's an assortment of lobster, shrimp, mussel, sausage, corn. 
It's supposedly all you can eat but it soon runs out after 2 servings.
To finish off, dessert is delicious a peach almond cake.

This is a seasonal event I think since it takes place on the sky bar rooftop patio.

I thought it was good value and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the Drake Hotel, the upstairs patio is my favorite it's a nice place to kick back and order great tapas, I love the cheeseboard and the oysters fresh fresh and delicious, The Decour inside there it's very hip and modern I just love the way it's decorated, the staff there are majorly friendly my favorite security guard is this blonde woman who is absolutely the best so friendly and always seeing her face makes me smile, I love to go here to celebrate they've got a great champagne list, also I recommend the lobster tacos... They are my favorite I cannot say anything bad about this place as they've always been very helpful and all my memories here have been wonderful, I met the owner he it's great super cool guy, I guess his staff follow his lead because everybody who works there seems to take an interest in you and makes you feel like hey I'm want to come back here,  thank you to the Drake staff for being so accommodating, fun fact if you're planning on throwing a private party they even have their own private party room or they will accommodate you in the restaurant, they even have a team dedicated to people who are planning on throwing parties so if you're looking to throw your next birthday/divorce party this is the place to do it!!!"}
{"text":"I went here during Happy Hour. My husband and I went for lunch. For the price, this place didn't blow my mind. The decor is trendy/borderline hipster. We went for the charcuterie board. There was nothing on that board that wowed us, it was definitely standard. I did however, enjoy their mustard. I also got suckered into ordering sushi and I'm happy I did, because it was pretty tasty. The drinks were half off which was nice. I'm not sure if we'll be going again for food. I would like to check it out at night."}
{"text":"After watching a Raptors game on a Sunday night (they won! :D), my friend and I walked to the Spirit House to enjoy mojitos which we both had been craving. Unfortunately, the place was closed. King Street was completely dead, and I was reminded of why Toronto is so lame. It was only around 9:30 pm on a Sunday night, and the streets were eerily quiet, and this was doubly surprising because of the warm weather we were enjoying. Sigh.

We walked around in vain, from empty bar to empty pub on Queen Street West, in search of a mojito. Finally, he suggested the Drake Hotel. I'd never been there, and neither had he, but we both had heard rave reviews of it. Discovering from their website, that it was open till 2 am, both of us were thrilled. We walked in and instantly gratified by our decision to go there. The lounge is large and beautiful. The seating arrangement is also well thought out. 

There are leather couches by the window. We chose to sit at one of the booths that were on the right hand side. We immediately got the Drake Mojito. After that we enjoyed some Vodka tonics, and multiple Gin & tonics. We also got the Blackforest Cake. 

All the drinks were fantastic. The Persian waiter we had really chill, and super friendly. He chatted us up the entire evening, and was very polite. The service was really fast. We didn't have to wait much for anything we ordered.

The Blackforest cake was rather small and not sweet enough for my liking, but the chocolate sorbet that accompanied it was good and made up for it. Still, their desserts menu could use some work. As it was approaching 1 am, we decided to head upstairs to the rooftop patio. It was beautiful. There was a clean fire pit, and we enjoyed excellent conversations and jokes with other folks who were sitting around the fire. I had a Baileys from the bar on the second floor. 

The waiter basically had to kick us out when it was 2 am, because we totally could have passed another hour or two around the fire. It is a classy place, but it still manages to create an atmosphere that is incredibly warm and inviting. I don't live too far away, so I've pretty much found my go to bar, now that I know it's open till 2, seven days a week! I'd choose this place over any pub. The service is very good, and the drinks are great. We ordered drinks amounting to over $150 for the two of us. I had a wonderful time, and am going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"For the sake of your time I'm going to recap this review in the next sentence, if you wish to continue reading for details please do so. 

Atmosphere is great, music is banging, and drinks are delicious. 

First impression wasn't the best as I didn't like how the hostess greeted us, felt a slight attitude. 

Our server was pretty chill though. I wasn't sure what drink to order, I let him know I like Vodka and sweet drinks, he said say no more and brought out the most refreshing drink ever!!! I took it down way too fast because it was that good. I then asked for another drink a little stronger but still sweet, he surprised me with yet another amazing drink. 

So if you like vodka and sweet drinks order the Wanderlust, can't recommend the other drink as it was made up by the bartender (boozy and sweet is what the server told him in order to get it right).

Didn't order a meal just an edamame appetizer, seasoning was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Drake for lunch today and sat on the patio.  We live in the area and surprisingly had never eaten there.

There were lots of servers buzzing around and there weren't that many people to serve but it took a while for server to take our drink order (two pops).  We waited about 20 minutes and STILL hadn't gotten our drinks so we got up and left and went to the Gladstone instead."}
{"text":"I ordered this grilled cheese yesterday at the Drake. It was listed on the menu as $18 before tax. I was so excited thinking this has got to be the greatest grilled cheese ever for the price. I could make 12 grilled cheeses at home for that amount of money. Much to my surprise I received this measly sandwich sized smaller than the palm of my damn hand. Sure the cheese was \"gourmet\" I guess but it wasn't worth 18$ that's for sure. They plated it with dry and flavourless mixed greens. I had to stop for a slice of pizza on my way home I was so hungry still. Don't order the grilled cheese. And maybe don't go to the Drake for food either."}
{"text":"everything on the menu is rich and sumptuous, like the decor. caramelized root veggies, polenta fries, bourbon ribs over jerusalem artichoke puree-- heavenly. the scene is hit or miss after dinner. decent DJs, great space (downstairs, roof bar and big lounge), but mixed crowd that's not so easy on the eyes. overall, a good place for an all-in-one bday, with a hotel room (Small but cute)."}
{"text":"I feel like I should go buy a pair of lace up boots and some underground tunes after staying here. The Drake Hotel seems to really inspire the hipster in everyone - but in a modern, clean & quirky kind of way. Not in an angsty attitude and dirty skinny jeans way. 

While I was a bit bummed I couldn't check into my room before 3pm, once I got into my crash pad, I was pretty delighted. It's a small room but complete with just about anything you would need and a few really neat touches. I really appreciated the ridiculously comfy bed with heavy down pillows, deliciously scented toiletries, free (and very stable) WiFi, and hand signed welcome note with a small bag of kettle corn for me to munch on. The crash pad is a pretty small room - likely most comfortable for just one person. Even though I very much like hanging out with my husband, this room would be pretty tight for two of us. 

What really makes the Drake stand out, though, is the wonderful staff. Everyone I encountered bent over backwards to make sure I was well taken care of. If you're seeking out a place to lay your head, the Drake Hotel is a prime choice. And in the battle between the Drake and the Gladstone, I gotta give it to the Drake."}
{"text":"I'm actually writing a review for their restaurant. (By the way, interesting concept of trendy hotel + restaurant/lounge + \"underground\" club). I was in Toronto for a friend's wedding and a big group of us went to The Drake Hotel for dinner the night before. We sat on the rooftop which had cool decor and the breeze was nice because the day was so hot. Service was good and the food, which was fusion, was really great. I really liked the lobster nachos and mac & cheese. We also got other stuff like fried rice and a ton of sushi. Yum... I totally pigged out... The bill came out pretty high though. So definitely a place to go when you're feeling like splurging. Also, apparently this place is the place to go if you're visiting Toronto, according to Air Canada."}
{"text":"giving 2 stars because the food was actually super tasty! the problem was our waiter. he was attentive at the beginning bringing waters for our table of 10 and then our first drinks, that's when shit hit the fan... he just flat out disappeared. we were sitting near the kitchen and cash area, and at about the 15 min mark after catching up and sipping some booze we kept seeing all these other waiters and waitresses come out. but not him... after about another 15 mins (yes... 30 mins) we flagged down a super attentive waiter at the table beside us and he took our orders. he also went to the back to find our guy. I wish we could have kept him but our waiter appeared and served. the rest
of the service wasn't bad, but seriously where did this guy go? we spent a good amount of money there, and we were a big group, shame he missed out on a good tip. 

food wise I recommend all the desserts... drink wise  there's one with \"tea\" in the name which was awesome."}
{"text":"Live music, good service, no rushing, awesome food... Need I say more? Sign me up any day!"}
{"text":"Our very large group (15 people or so) was here for a Saturday afternoon brunch. Decor is very trendy, and I had heard the terrace / verandah on the second floor was the place to be in the summer when the weather is better. We were seated in the main dining room and were presented with a special menu for large groups. I was told this was to make it somewhat simpler for the kitchen to handle the orders for groups in general, as well as allow a more consistent brunch experience overall. 

The starter was a parfait (yogurt with granola and berries) which was delicious, followed by breakfast biscuits with dipping sauce, which again was super yum! For the main course I ordered the steak and hash, presentation looked amazing, however, upon taking a bite realized the steak had been done medium rare. Did not recall being asked how the steak should be cooked (my preference is medium). Upon inquiry the wait staff promptly admitted they had made a mistake and not asked anyone in our group (default for the dish was medium rare). He apologized and said it was his fault and not the fault of the hotel and offered to cook it a bit more. This owning up to the error was appreciated. However, others as well as myself who had ordered the dish and who preferred their steak cooked differently did not finish the meal, which was unfortunate. Others who had ordered the smoked salmon bagel or the chicken & waffle (signature dish) could not stop raving about it. Service was good, but not exceptional 

It is a challenge to review the meal based on the experience of such a large group as managing groups can be difficult. Will be visiting again with fewer people and hope to raise the rating to a 5 star at that time. In the meantime, when ordering the steak and hash, be sure to specify how you want the steak done :)"}
{"text":"It's all about summer time at the drake on their patio. I don't know what it is about this place - but every sunday in the summer, this is where i want to be if i'm in the city.
Staff are good. Crowd is nice. Music is funky. 
I also like how they set up a shot bar on the patio on the weekends.

Every year the decor of the patio changes as well. Can't wait to see what this summer brings :)


Also, i will mention that i used to organize my staff parties, and the drake is a great place to this in the lounge area main floor. Very very reasonably priced and the food is amazing. Cool things like fish and chips in mini newspaper wraps, fried rice in tiny chinese take out boxes, sushi, sliders etc. Great service always and they work with all budgets."}
{"text":"Awesome rooftop patio with amazing lounge music. 
Below, the cllub/bar plays great dance music as well"}
{"text":"Was looking for a a brunch spot that would accommodate my vegan self and my meat eating friends and settled on the Drake. The customer service was superb! I got the açaí bowl and a potato has that was great-I do wish they had more vegan options. The açaí bowl was not sweet at all which I like. But let me just say the habanero hot sauce was everything! My friends got the burger and cheddar biscuits and loved it. Apparently the jalapeño jam for the biscuits was amazing! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Hahahahahahaha. The Drake is pretty hilarious. Pretentious, takes itself so seriously type of hilarious hilarious.  

My boyfriend hates the Drake; Here's a true story - He lived on Queen Street west in what he calls it's \"Glory Era\" before all the treeeendy restaurants, boutique hotels and dumb ass condos started moving in. You know that glorious time when hookers would just chill in front of stores at around 2 am, the CAMH patients would wander the streets and scare people, that time when the Drake was a dangerous biker bar? My boyfriend got such a kick outta living there within that sort of ~colorful city landscape~ and he confirms that it all went to shit when the Drake came along. And it's true, the Queen West area was an artist haven with cheap rent for studios, The construction of the Bohemian Lofts pushed out an old factory that housed a ton of artists in converted loft. I digress, but gentrification sucks hard balls.

The Drake ruined everything, according to my lover. So he invested in a t-shirt that said \"Fuck the Drake\" and felt that was enough to ~Fight the Power~. So as a goof one night, he ended up at the Drake years later, wearing that same shirt in winter (he got in because he had a coat over it). So multiple drinks later, he wanders back out front for a smoke, sans coat, the security guard sees the shirt and legitimately says to my boyfriend \"sorry buddy, I can't let you back in with that shirt.\"


AHAHAHAHAH. Fuck you guy. And Fuck the Drake.

HOWEVER, I was desperate to close out 2013 in the classiest fashion possible and I had heard the Drake hosted one of the best New Years Eve parties in the city. So here I was, considering shelling out 150 bucks per person for a private booth all night, a 4 course luxurious meal, and a complimentary glass of bubbly. Obviously the boyfriend was SO AGAINST IT, that I had to bribe him with a lot of bourbon, and pay for his ticket. SO we dressed up all Baller and ended up going. And basically I learned that night that money DOES buy happiness. everything was overpriced, but fucking delicious. Like fuck, all the food was so fucking rich, filling and glorious, that I had to force feed myself the Lobster main course because I was like \"I basically paid 50 dollars for this delicious plate of fucking heart attack/clogged arteries.\" The service was beyond excellent and the wait staff was generally super cool. We left a big tip because fuck it HAPPYY NEWWW YEARRRRRR. Surprisingly, it was a really interesting mix of people there that night, annoying 905'ers with hyena laughs, some guy who looked like a broke down Bryan Ferry in a Union Jack jacket who kept leering at the young sexy girlz, and then annoying college kids wandered in to take up space on the dance floor.

So yea, for their NYE event, The Drake hella turns it out. The music they played that night was pretty cool too, a few 90s Euro tracks, but after midnight, the DJ started trolling and kept playing Drake (Jimmy from Degrassi Drake...) every 5 songs. It was fucking stupid. Basically, I feel really conflicted about anything that involves the word \"Drake\"."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hotel*, drank in the bar, and had dinner. I will say one thing... we had no idea what we were walking into but we absolutely loved it!

My boyfriend made the comment, \"If only there was a really great restaurant with comfy beds upstairs.\" Well, we found one! The hotel is based entirely around provoking your inner sexual being. No matter if you're the timid kind or the S&M type, you will find what you are looking for here. We walked into our room and adjacent to the bed was the shower encased in glass. This, of course, was his favorite part of the room. On the bed was a stuffed animal in bondage, yes an S&M stuffed animal - for sale! Upon snooping around the room we found a hand curated dvd menu. Pages and pages of descriptions of featured length-ed erotic entertainment. These of course could be delivered to you discretely if you so desire. Adding to your visit are the products provided by The Drake: Malin + Goetz.These add sensual aromas to an already sexually charged room. The best products I have had provided. Right up there with Bvlgari! Which of course may be purchased at the Apothecary downstairs.  
I do have one 'complaint' about the room... Just as the shower is encased in glass, so is the WC. Which can make for some awkward moments. The glass is frosted but you can see your feet and if the lights are on- your silhouette as well. Will this deter me from going back- hell no. 

We also had dinner reservations. Our table wasn't quite ready so we sat at the bar! The drink list is superb! I'm talking 50s style drinking. I started out with The Farmers Daughter which had ginger, vanilla, and cinnamon blended finely with scotch. It tasted great, a little bitter according to my boyfriend, and the ginger puree made it pulpy.  He had a barrel aged cocktail- a not your average run of the mill drink. Honestly I think we came here specifically so he could have one- or two! He had the Boulevardier, a burboun campari and sweet vermouth imported from Italy. The key here is \"imported from Italy\".  He proceeded to the Majreha which was a deliciously lite Key Lime Pie on the rocks. Very lite, don't let that description deter you. He then followed it up with another Boulevardier and I with a Majreha. 

There was a prix-fixed dinner menu but we opted for off the regular menu selections. We started with the Hemp salad and home-ade bread basket with dips and things. A very good start to our meal. I ordered the Crispy Chicken with a hollandaise sauce roasted veggies! Absolutely fabulous. He had the Arctic Char with roasted fennel argula, a cilantro mint chutney perfectly pan seared. 

Desert was a doughnut with a \"double-double\". The doughnut was sinful and the whipped cream just melted in our mouths. The whipped cream was actually the double-double part... at the bottom was espresso flavored whipped cream. A wonderful little surprise to end an amazing meal!

* Not a family friendly hotel. This hotel is sex driven. Which is fine, but I am glad we didn't have my son with us. I would have had to have an awkward and premature talk with him about things I am just not ready to talk about yet!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I came here a while ago. I don't remember much (too much boozey, boozey), but I do remember a foie gras stuffed donut. Like you can forget that. It was weirdly tasty--had pancetta draped on top of fried dough that had been sliced in half, with foie gras in it. I suppose salty pork makes everything taste good. 

And I do remember the chili cheese poutine. Chili...good. French fries.... Good. Cheese.... GOOD!!!

Definitely not a place you can just stumble into, but cool, hip ambiance, and great service."}
{"text":"Stayed here for just one night and it is really a neat place - rooms are very compact so perfect for a single or a couple who do not mind being very close. Bathroom and toilet are part of room so if sharing - and you are shy - probably not good for you! Very comfy bed A a/c worked great.. No elevators so if you cannot walk stairs you will not like it - but for me it's great! Everyone is super friendly! Well lit room with desk space if you need to work!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Drake Hotel for Saturday brunch. It was my first time and, in my opinion, the second floor patio (newly renovated) is a hidden gem. The ambiance is one of eclectic modern and the service (speedy and friend) lends itself to a comfortable meal. I am hesitant to give a higher review because it took 40+ minutes to recieve our food after ordering; the wait staff did comp our coffees but a tad inconvenient none the less. Check out the attached picture of the smoked salmon bagel."}
{"text":"Review for the awesome rooftop bar.

Went here for drinks to ring in a friend's birthday. We came in as two drunk americans to the roof top bar and had a fabulous time. It was a monday night so the place was pretty slow and we got to get to know the bartenders and the other patrons. 

A real friendly vibe with awesome service. The bartender on duty poured shots for my birthday friend and was wicked nice. The atmosphere was laid back and causal. I'm not a big party girl and I felt O.K. on the roof top deck. However, according to the previous reviews this place can get pretty clubby on the weekends. But it must be a good place because the bartender off duty was still there chilling at the bar. His name was Jason and if you ever go there when he's on duty he was wicked awesome! I come from Boston and am a HUGE hockey fan, so it was to talk hockey with someone who knew about Canadian teams and U.S. teams. I felt like the entire atmosphere was welcoming and great. 

Also the bartender made us some kick ass shots. I don't know exactly what they were but they were tasty. Also had a glass of the red sangria and it was delish. Great for the price too. If you're there with a group I would recommend the pitcher, because you will save money getting a pitcher if you want more than 2 glasses. 

Overall, I think the drake hotel roof top bar is pretty cool and people should come here. I am giving it four stars now because I don't know what it's like when it's busy. Otherwise it would be five."}
{"text":"Really nice for Brunch! Good food and good service! Also.. they have brunch until 4 pm on Sunday! How good is that?"}
{"text":"My partner and I had planned a visit to Toronto following a friend's wedding in Rochester, NY. We thought Toronto would be a great place for us to explore for 24-48 hours especially because it was so close to our wedding location. We booked a room about a month in advance. 

My partner was a tad skeptical about staying here because the rooms were so tiny. I am pretty flexible with space and actually don't mind small spaces, she on the other hand is not that big of a fan but decided to deal with it because I wanted to stay here so badly. I had found their website through Google and thought the hotel seemed awesome. I went back and forth between the Gladstone and Drake - decided to go with Drake because it seemed more modern & urban.

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Customer Service - 4 stars
Room - 3 stars (4 stars if our room didn't have issues)
Parking - 3 stars
Restaurant - 3 stars 
Overall - 4 stars

Let me begin by saying that I love the concept of this establishment and wish we had stayed a night that they were having a show or event. But unfortunately, nothing was on the event calendar. So my review is primarily for the hotel and restaurant only.

Immediately upon arrival we were greeted by a wonderful and friendly hotel desk attendant, I believe his name was Jonathan. He was incredibly helpful and apparently had spoken with my partner in advance about reserving a parking space. So he knew who we were and took care of us. He upgraded us to a slightly larger room, and when I say slightly... I really mean slightly. So the room we actually stayed in was a tad more expensive than the room we reserved, however I am really not sure why because they looked about the same size for the most part.

When we checked out the room, it was super clean and neat. We even received a little welcome bag of popcorn that was addressed to us personally which is a nice touch. The only issue I really had with the room was that it had a huge crack in the mirror of the shower which kinda freaked me out. It was so big that it looked like it would fall and crack open any second. It was being held together with tape. The second issue was that the light in the shower didn't work. So we couldn't shower at night if we wanted to, which I would have loved to do after the long drive up - but wasn't able to. We called Jonathan up to take a look. He did and was willing to work with us but it just seemed too much of a hassle because so we decided to just let it go. So if the room was in tip top shape, I would have given it 4-5 stars. I thought it was a great room. Gorgeous decor and super cozy. The space wasn't an issue for my partner after all, they did such a good job working with the little space that they had. Props to that.

With that being said, customer service was excellent when dealing with the hotel staff and front desk. As for the restaurant and hostesses in the front, they were not the friendliest. They had a little bit of an attitude, 

The parking is essentially a public parking lot across the street in where they have just a few spaces reserved. This was totally fine with us except the lot was super narrow. When we checked out the next day they were doing construction and blocked off a part of it which made us have to drive over the curb. Fortunately, we were driving an SUV so it wasn't that big of a deal. Super inconvenient though.

The room features a bunch of snacks and items that can be purchased. Don't be fooled by the description on their website. On the website, they make it seem as the room comes with a complimentary handmade doll when in fact it does not. There is a handmade doll on the bed waiting for your arrival. Interesting fun little bondage stuffed dolls with hairy chests. Like I said... interesting! There is no price and nothing that says they are for sale - although they claim it is on a price list of some sort which I did not see. The doll is $70. We brought it home and got billed. Oops. We called and spoke with Jonathan, Mr. Hairy Chest Man is going back to Canada. Jonathan was nice about it and let us return him via mail.

As for the restaurant, I don't think it's all that. For the inconveniences we ran into during our stay, Jonathan provided us with complimentary drink tickets for the restaurant. We had a couple drinks and decided to grab an appetizer to share. We ordered the lobster nachos for our shared appetizer, which was actually quite good. The menu was limited and really this was the only thing that appealed to us. We had a couple mixed drinks and they were pretty weak. I am a lightweight and needed at least 3-4 drinks to really get a buzz. That was kind of a bummer when the drinks are $10 - $12 each. Everything on the menu is extremely overpriced so I didn't care for the place. But the concept and decor of the restaurant is cool. Our server was alright - not the friendliest.

Overall, I was a fan and would return again. It IS pricey so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Buttermilk pancakes are awesome, but good for two.

Blueberry scones fabulous.

It's great for breakfast/brunch in general.

As for late night snacks.

I had been dying to try the Lobster Nachos they were awesome and Banana \"CAKE\" was to dye for."}
{"text":"Great ambiance with unusual and interesting decor set a cozy mood for dining.  The food itself was less than I would expect for a restaurant this noted.  The dessert saved it - outstanding lemon tart with brulee topping.  Overall good experience, and would come back again."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for weekend brunch. We loved this experience. The atmosphere was great. It was a little pricy, but they served us very good quality and delicious food.

I ordered Drake Benny with roasted mushrooms and my friend ordered Chicken & Waffle. The chicken was very tasty, and she loved it. the Benny was also great, and it came with lots of mushrooms and potatoes which were amazing. If you are a mushroom lover, this Benny is a must try. Overall, the dishes were fresh, delicious and tasted great. I definitely recommend these dishes.

The service was excellent and our server was very friendly. Although the restaurant was pretty full and many were waiting to be seated, our server did not rush us at all to pay and leave.

I very liked this place and may come back there for brunch again."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a weekend where you went broke from bottomless glasses of wine or partying too hard? Maybe you have always had a curiosity to learn and to try a variety of food to expand your palate?

Drake Hotel is the place to be on Monday nights! They hold weekly food sampling events with a different theme at no cost. If oysters or fish ever became endangered, I would definitely be part of the problem! Being a huge fan of seafood, I had attended the \"6th Annual Ocean Wise Ceviche Smackdown\" event. I had some of the freshest oysters shucked on the spot and an assortment of fresh seafood that were flavorful and garnished to perfection.

Every week is a surprise and definitely worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Cool venue with great ambiance and top service.  But the food is overpriced and the portions are quite small.  They have pretty good wine and prosecco on Tuesdays, for half-price night."}
{"text":"I guess if you're showing someone around who is from LA, at some point you need to hit the Drake.  So we did, opting for the Sky Yard.  Honestly, I could live without this place, but I got to give it its just deserts.  It's summer and this patio is nice.  Our server last night was very attentive too which scored this place points.  

What I disliked about this place last night is whoever was in control of the music kept randomly switching songs in the middle of a tune and then other times allowing awkward moments of silence to happen.  If this is a regular thing, they need to really step up their music game.  If it was a fluke, then fair enough.

The other drawback of this place is the rooftop gets really smokey.  I can't stand being sandwiched in with other people's second hand stank."}
{"text":"Great music and ambiance everytime at the Drake. Lots of inventive cocktails and a nice spread of food options as well. Couldn't resist getting dessert and didn't regret my decision.

What I got:
- Truffle lasagna
- Brussel sprouts
- Chocolate ganache tart with dark chocolate gelato

Would recommend all of them again!

Overall would recommend the Drake for dinner, perfect for a get together with your group of friends before partying it out downstairs. A bonus is once you are in the restaurant, no need to pay for cover for upstairs or downstairs!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe and cool interior. I've been here a few times and its always so full of energy here. I heard they have a Chinese new year menu and wanted to try it out. Although I was disappointed as I googled online there was suppose also have a Drake dim shum event. And online says it's starting at 8pm. However, when I arrived, the event must've been cancelled and at 9pm announcements were made that they were giving out taste bottles of tsingtao beer.
There shrimp wontons was too salty but the fried rice was añ interesting combination. The best was probably the chicken thighs. Juicy and succulent to crispy chicken skin  ... Yums! Come here for the atmosphere, not the food. That's my advice!"}
{"text":"Trivia night (Wednesdays) at the Drake is really fab. 

I've always sort of avoided this place but found myself going specifically to play trivia, and it was a really fun night! DJ/Trivia host is very well organized and the quiz includes a variety of audio (music) and visual (tv screen) clues. Only costs $2 per person and there are prizes for top scoring teams.

Would definitely go again just for the trivia. Place gets pretty packed, we arrived at 7:45pm without a reservation so we were stuck sitting at the bar, but they have lots of cozy booths and relaxing tables at the front.

Very cool. Friendly bar staff and quite hipsterish."}
{"text":"Keeping the stars the same because of the inconsistent service and food. Thought I would update the review since my last was from 2012 and it's now 2014.

Today we had a great time and saw the renovated space (no more bookshelves and way more booths). Finally tried the Chicken and Waffles, damn was it good. I would probably get the syrup and creme fraiche on the side next time. Had to scrape a lot of it off. Chicken was cooked to perfection. This time the scones were fresh and wonderful.

They have Fried Chicken as a side now! And serve brunch e'ryday! Good thing too because the last time we went for a weekday breakfast it was pretty dead."}
{"text":"I haven't stayed at the Drake Hotel, but I've been here on several occasions for the restaurant.

For me, the Drake Hotel is an iconic Toronto landmark.  You may disagree on a thing or two about this place, but one thing most can agree on is this place has got character.  

The food is generally quite good.  It may hit some highs, it may hit some lows.  Also, it can be on the pricey side.  But it is playful and anything but dull.

The venue itself is striking.  The space is beautiful, as is the decor.  Most importantly, the venue is versatile.  I've been here for dinner, for drinks, for brunch, for lounging, for dancing, and for watching a band (downstairs.)  It's always buzzing with action."}
{"text":"Wednesday Trivia Nights at The Drake!

I attended Trivia Night at Drake Hotel (a hipster boutique hotel at Queen West in T.O) on Wed 6/22.

Wed, 8pm - Drake Hotel, 1150 Queen St W (bet Beaconsfield Ave & Lisgar St, near Abell St), 416-531-5042
http://www.thedrakehotel.ca/events/10963/trivia-night 
https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=342068735620
Twitter: @thedrakehotel
$2/player, 4 people per team (1pt deduction per round for each person above 4ppl that are on the team).

The Q's here were really hard!  Some were Canada-specific.

It was 3 rounds of 13 Q's.  The first 10 Q's were regular general knowledge Q's.  The last 3 were either Picture or Name That Tune Q's.  Every question is worth 1pt, unless both the artist & song title were asked, in which case that Q was worth 2pts (1 for artist & 1 for song title).

There were possibly ~20 teams.  It's impossible to tell b/c the QM doesn't grade the sheets (teams swap and grade each other's sheets), and the QM doesn't ask for tallies.  He only asks for the final score of the highest scoring team at the end.  You basically have your hand raised and he starts going up, saying, \"keep your hand raised if you scored 20pts, ... 30pts, 31pts, ...\"

For last night's trivia, it was out of a possible 45pts (13pts, 16pts, 16pts).  We scored 6+3+4pts for a grand total of 13pts!  Yes, it was that hard.

The Q's were really tough, but we learned a lot.  
Some examples (we got the Q correct, unless otherwise noted):

Q: How many balls are there on the pool table at the beginning of a snooker game?
A: 22 (we guessed 17)

Q: What British playwright was stabbed to death while walking on the streets of London in 15-something-something?
A: Marlowe (we guessed Chaucer)

Q: What was the flight # for the Oceanic Airlines flight that crashed and was the basis for LOST?
A: 815 (guessed 418)

Q: What does a bicephalopod have two of?
A: Heads (guessed Brains)

Q: What is the name of Dora The Explorer's monkey?
A: Boots (BS guess of Chico)

Q: At which CT casino (the largest in the world by # of slot machines) did the Boston Bruins celebrate their Stanley Cup victory by spending a bar tab of over $150,000 (most of it was on an expensive bottle of champagne)?
A: Foxwoods (guessed Mohegan Sun)

Q: What national police force is known overseas as \"The Force\"?
A: Canada's RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police).  We guessed Israel.  Steve & Wilson, who are Canadian, have never heard of Mounties being called \"The Force\" either.

Q: What is the term when a whale jumps out of the water?
A: Breaching (guessed Cresting)

Q: In 1966, what film, that was based on a play, was nominated for an Oscar for every possible category it was eligible for?
A: Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (guessed West Side Story)

Q: What is the only country that does not sell Coke or Pepsi?  In fact, both are illegal there.
A: North Korea

Q: What language has the most words (most vocabulary)?
A: English (guessed Chinese)

Q: From 1815-1820(?), what foreign city was the capital of Portugal?
A: Rio de Janeiro (guessed Paris b/c of Napoleon, it probably moved to Brasil b/c the king & queen probably fled there to avoid Napoleon)

Q: In 1840, German forgot-his-name coined what term for the system of teaching children?
A: Kindergarten (guessed School)

Q: What is the score needed in an IQ test to be considered a genius?
A: 140 (guessed 150)

The hotel was a cool hangout spot, and reminded me of places like Bowery Hotel.  There are multiple bars and places to eat inside the hotel.  The lounge area on the 1st floor, where trivia was held, served drinks, beers on tap, and had a food menu, which included sushi.  The food was pricey, and not that great, for what you end up paying for.  The place is a bit far off for the Subway to reach, but it's on Queen West, and is in a Williamsburg-like hipster area of T.O.  You can get there by car, taxi, streetcar, or bus.

Compared to Pour Boy, I enjoyed TN at Pour Boy better.  It was more intimate with questions that didn't make me say WTF?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and here went for brunch while in Toronto, drawn in by their outdoor patio because it was a beautiful summer day. 

The food was really really good, some of the best brunch food I've ever had even! I got the smoke salmon bagel. The salmon was perfectly cooked and all the toppings on the bagel added the perfect combination of flavors.  My boyfriend got the duck confit hash, which is quite a fancy brunch treat. The egg was cooked so perfectly, even my non-yelping boyfriend had to take a picture. And it tasted just as good as it looked! 

This place would be great for brunch with friends or family. 

There is FREE parking on the side streets, which was so convenient! 

The service was also great. Coming from out of town, the waiter was very nice in recommending places elsewhere in the area to check out. 

When I'm back in toronto, I'd definitely go back! 

(Side note: one reason we came was because this was listed as having a rooftop deck, this is not true from what I could see, but there is still the great patio as mentioned above!)"}
{"text":"The room decor is quite nice and smart - making the most of small quarters- but I must say I was a slight bit disappointed with you, The Drake. I stayed for 2 nights in the crash pad - the bed is comfortable, the soaps are very nice though you can tell you'll be charged an arm and a leg if you take them, the cafe is charming. But the prices are kindof absurd - I had a dirty martini in the cafe and it was 17$. !? I mean, it was top shelf, but common, even in New York I dont pay those prices. They leave you cute teeny tiny gingerbread cookies by the bed the first night, but then they weren't there the second night, which seems a bit stingy. Other hotels that leave you chocolates replace them every night. On weekend nights, the place becomes a mad house and there are people blocking you from getting inside and then security guys asking you at each point where you are going, which is pretty annoying. Also, there isn't really a lobby so you are very close to a lot of drunk people loitering about - I wish the transition had been designed better - a separate entrance, or hotel guests greeted first..

Overall the people were very friendly, the hotel is \"super cool\" and the location is perfect. A-OK."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch. Great, imaginative, delicious takes on classic Sunday brunch. The Drake is an icon, and their restaurant, the food, the staff and the overall vibe does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Rooftop bar at the Drake Hotel is the place to be in Toronto on a warm summer night! 

Great drinks + wonderful friends + fantastic nibble foods = A perfect summer night.

I LOVED my lavender lemonade (lemonade with vodka and lavender syrup). A wonderful sweet lavender syrup at the bottom gave the lemonade a ethereal purple glow. The sweetness of the syrup didn't overwhelm the tartness of the lemonade. 

The fries were really good. My friends and I downed a couple orders before we knew it. Then we upped the ante with poutine. 

THE BEST POUTINE. And I don't even **like** poutine. Poutine is a Quebecois fare of fries, cheese curds, and gravy. The poutine at the Drake hotel is the Holy Grail of all poutines. There were incredible succulent pieces of beef in the heavenly brown gravy. The cheese curds melted into an ooey gooey loving hug around the fries. Topped off with the toothsome meat in the luscious gravy makes for one incredible umami bomb of a flavor.

It was a little too loud for me. We had to yell in order to hear ourselves and I wish Toronto would pass a ban on smoking in outdoor patios. Seriously this is a city that won't let you use pesticides on grass, but apparently second hand smoke is A-OK. 

I arrived just before 8:30 and was seated in less than 10 minutes. Arrive after 9:30, and forget about it. The place was packed!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday but their brunch is only on weekends. Delicious French onion soup and mac and cheese. Cool place, overpriced of course."}
{"text":"An overly pretentious bar-restaurant combo for 20's and 30's located along Queen West near Ossington and Queen Street. Service alone deserves one star: snooty hostesses with attitude, waitresses who don't even look at you or smile, and often confrontational staff. Don't even bother coming here for drinks only because the staff will kick you out of your table and make you feel unwelcomed. Especially watch out for that redhead hostess; she is a nightmare in disguise and knows zilch about customer service. There are hundreds of bars in Toronto and I'll be glad to take my business elsewhere. Mixed drinks were $14 and tasted terrible and beers were room temp and $7. Not exactly great value. I've been to many bars in Toronto and this is unfortunately by far the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Total snobs, and my suggestion is to avoid this place at all costs. The only pros is that they accommodate large groups downstairs, but only if you order food. Sorry Drake Hotel that it didn't work out but you're a heart-breaker. My advice to management is to get rid of the attitude and stop talking down to your customers. If you're in the area, go to the Gladestone Hotel bar instead, just a few minutes west. The staff there are much more down to earth."}
{"text":"Went out with a couple of friends here for trivia night and it was probably the most fun I've had in a bar setting. Not only that, the food was really good too. Just short of 1 star for a full rating just because the dessert wasn't up to par. Had the pavlova cake and haven't tried this before but it was a powdered cake (that had some sort of chalky texture) with grapefruit in the centre (really sour) and creamsicle gelato on the top. However the lasagna I had was great. I think it had some sort of truffle / cream flavouring, and I also wished it was served in bigger portions as it was 22$ for a small strip of it. All in all I had a great time on trivia night, and will probably make it a routine with my friends every week!"}
{"text":"I had the most brutal brunch experience here a few weekends ago. 

Came around 11am on a sunny Saturday morning. The patio was busy but there were seats available inside, which was fine. Ordered the much raved about \"Warm Scone Share Plate\" and the ALT. Note that you get four teeny tiny doll-sized scones for $9.50. Alternately, for the same price, you could get a regular, human-sized scone at any coffee shop for a third of the price. My ALT was also completely lame -- literally plain scrambled egg whites, toast, sliced up tomato and avocado and salad greens arranged on a plate. I don't know why I thought it would be anything different than what was clearly stated on the menu (oh wait, because it's a RESTAURANT, with a CHEF, that's charging $11.75 for a plate), but really, anyone could prepare this breakfast at home with little skill and effort. 

The piece de resistance was that the service was really, truly, without a doubt TERRIBLE. Our server literally ignored our table for our entire stay as we slowly nibbled at our food hoping she would come by so we could ask for some ketchup and hot sauce. Eventually we choked down the dry homefries and the bland eggs (with empty water glasses, no less) and left as soon as we could get our bill (which also took a painfully long time). I feel angry just thinking about it! Brunch is supposed to be a happy occasion!"}
{"text":"The Drake is a pretty remarkable venue; swanky hotel, dance club, and restaurant all rolled into one. I have enjoyed every level of its luxury (that being the basement, main level, and roof-top patio), and have attended many different types of events at each.

The dancing, when I've had it, has always been awesome; always good music, the crowd so hip it hurts (in a good way), drinks are delicious and a little more than I was used to paying (in my younger, less-sophisticated days), and the food is always something I look forward to. I had my first taste of the mini-burgers on a stick at least 2 years ago, and I still long for them, from time to time. I was also lucky enough to be invited to a party that boasted a lovely brunch spread, with more cheeses, baked and flaky goods, fruits, mini-pancakes and sparkle-tastic ~mimosas~ (champagne for breakfast?! who comes UP with this stuff?) than I thought even existed in heaven.

But one of my favourite Drake memories has to be the time that my friends and I walked by on a busy Friday and begged them to only let us use their very cool and old school photo booth. It was silly, fun, and a good example of how cool and nice the staff is there, which is refreshing for the hot spot that it is."}
{"text":"Absolute awful experience. 

The service was absolutely disappointing. I went in a group of 4 people for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant wasn't overloaded with customers and we ended up waiting a whooping 45 minutes for our food to arrive.  

We had to literally hoist our server down to get a refill on water. 
The brunch menu was unreasonably overpriced in comparison to its competitors. In addition, midway through our meals, my boyfriend found two strands of lovely hair embedded in his food. He shortly lost his appetite after this and consulted the matter to the server. The server was apologetic and waived the meal. However apart from that, we never got any sort of compensation for the terrible experience. 
In conclusion, I can firmly say I will never step foot here again."}
{"text":"Great way to dance away a Saturday night. The music is great, love the various rooms and rooftop patio. I've never eaten there, but the bar selection is definitely up to par."}
{"text":"I've been told to try The Drake Hotels' chicken and waffles for a while now and WOW it was amazing. From just walking in, the feel of the place was pretty good. The staff was very attentive and the menu was not confusing.  Our server Alex was really great and added to our experience. Once he brought out our meals and I had a taste, I needed to get pinched because I felt like I was in heaven! I was blown away by the awesomeness! I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Drake Hotel for an after dinner drink with my boyfriend. It was a tad busy, so they told us to take a seat at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and the atmosphere was amazing. The bartender recommended the Call Me Maybe and it was good but pretty pricy for its size. I think the best thing about the place is the ambience - as for food, we only ordered the fries and they were just okay. Definitely a cool place for a date though!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I celebrated my birthday with a bunch of friends and decided I wanted to check out the Drake Underground. I had been to the upstairs roof top patio a while before that, and thought it was alright, but I heard great thing about the Underground that I decided I wanted to check it out.
When I got to the door, I paid the $5 admission and was about to drop off my coat at coat check and then noticed the Underground was closed for a private event. Fine.
Since we already paid for admission, we decided to stay and check out the lounge and go upstairs to the roof top patio. The lounge was completely full, it felt like a sardine can, and the dj was playing horrible techno-lounge music.  The crowd were people in their late 30's and older.
Then we decided to go to the patio and we waited in the lineup for 45 minutes. By the time we got to the front of the line, the bouncers were letting people in suits and girls with practically no clothes on cut in front of the line. It made a lot of people upset but the staff didn't care, so we left. Unless you walk in there with a suit or pull up out of a lambourgini don't expect to be treated well by the staff. 
That was a horrible night and I wouldn't recommend the Drake lounge to anyone who wants to have a fun night."}
{"text":"Went her for brunch.  Got the eggs Benny with smoked salmon for $20. Eggs a bit overcooked and not runny. Expected better but great location and good patio.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Trustworthy usually but the tuna tartare was muddled with a lot of things not tuna- bummer.  The oyster sliders tasted like pickled oysters battered..left a strange vinegar taste in the mouth but the sushi and sashimi was fresh and light"}
{"text":"There is just so much to love about the Drake Hotel!

-complimentary popcorn & bubbly (they like me... they really like me!) with a handwritten \"welcome back\" note, as it was my second time here
-extremely accommodating staff who will kindly carry even your biggest, heaviest suitcase up to your room when you're wearing heels (I hate asking for help with my luggage. I'd rather leave that to the people who really need it!)
-access to a pretty sweet gym just a little ways away
-that rooftop patio!
-beds... comfy comfy beds
-funny/creepy doll on the bed that provide endless amusement for your IG followers
-really really nice shower products

The thing to know is, as some people mention, unless you're in one of the suites, this is *not a place to share a room* unless you have no hang-ups whatsoever. I wasn't in the smallest rooms (aka the Nooks/Crash Pads ), but a Den, which may sound big from the description, but it's the size of a typical hotel room, perhaps even a little smaller than that. Your bathroom is literally just a few feet from the bed, and it's a toilet enclosed in glass. The shower is a separate tiny glass enclosure and while I'm smaller sized person, I had to be careful not to knock my limbs into the glass (I'm clumsy, too). The sink/mirror is outside of the shower and toilet enclosures, ie, out in the open. Let's just say, I couldn't even stay here with my boyfriend unless I made him wait outside while I did my business. 

Note: I haven't yet stayed in one of suites, so this is an assumption that they are big enough to afford more privacy.

Yes, the walls are thin. And you will hear people... doing what people do. Some are doing things quite enthusiastically. No hatred for them. It's the walls' fault. The hotel is very adoring towards everyone. Leave your hang-ups at home.

Two dollar sign should be more like 3. It's rare that you're going to find even the smallest \"crash pad\" for under $200 Canadian, so be prepared to fork it over or share and make your roommate leave when you're showering or doing other bathroomy type things. That's awkward for this price point.

That said, I adore staying here when I'm in town for work, which is always by myself. I love being about to walk out of the hotel and be steps away from phenomenal eateries, bars, shopping and the park, too! Staying in this neighborhood is everything if you're looking to not be in a soulless corporate part of the city."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the quality of food or as a venue space. This is because on Halloween 2014, me and a small group of friends went to the Drake planning on seeing a show and getting dinner and drinks. I googled \"Drake Hotel accessible\" and found something saying the gallery and eating areas were accessible. My friends and I knew there was a chance the show would be down a flight of stairs, but at least we could get dinner and drinks. So we traveled the loooong way there since the Queen streetcar isn't accessible, and we arrived fairly early. Not early enough. It was pouring down rain, and there was a big step up with no ramp, and we found a side entrance without steps. The staff just gave us looks and pointed to the front, so we pointed to our friend using a chair. The sort of sighed and begrudgingly let us in. Then, once we're in, the inform us the kitchen is closing RIGHT NOW, and no the venue area isn't accessible, and probably the electric chair won't fit in the bathroom, but I guess we could stay for drinks. Since none of us are young and stupid enough to have liquid dinner after working all day, that wasn't an option. None of this would have been so bad if the staff didn't keep staring and generally acting like we were in the wa as we sorted out what to do in the lobby. We were told repeatedly that the building was an historical building so *shrug*, and asked roughly ever minute if we were staying or leaving. If you were in Toronto Oct. 31 2014, you probably remember how gawdawful the weather was. West Queen West lacks accessible options, and we just wanted a few minutes to figure out what to do and be able to text to the other person joining us where to go. The staff was pushy and unsympathetic, and from the first to last interaction acted like we were being unreasonable and difficult customers. Because our friend can't walk. Thanks for that.
I'm sure if I had gone by myself for drinks and a show, I would have had a great time. It's a popular spot, has great shows, and is conveniently close to Poutini's for late night drunken noms. But it turns out the think wheelchairs are a big fat nuisance, so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and waffles. Chicken was cooked well, crispy and juicy. Waffles were cold, hard. You can't do well on one and not the other! Shame. Maybe they just let it sit for too long. Service was good tho. The server probably refilled my glass every two sips. Lol"}
{"text":"FOOD: 3/5
Came here for brunch on Saturday afternoon and it was a little busy, there is nothing special about the food here, and it's a bit on the expensive side. Chicken and waffles shone out but at $21, not very value for money...the eggs benny was $17 and it was very okay...on the bright side, there wasn't a super long wait unlike some other brunch places in the area. We also had to wait quite a while for the food to be served. Will I be back for brunch? Unlikely.

UNDERGROUND: 4/5
I really love the Underground as a venue. Shows are generally inexpensive and it's a pretty intimate venue."}
{"text":"Three things I learned on my recent mid-week lunch visit to The Drake: 

1) They've changed their lunch menu. It seems to have a wider variety of options, including all their breakfast foods. I opted for the soup of the day (Moroccan chick pea) and a bagel with cream cheese, but sometimes I do want eggs for lunch so this is great news. 

2) Tuesday afternoons the north lounge does something called Highchair Hangouts for moms and their wee ones. There is stroller parking next to the bar and a gaggle of tiny tots hanging out while their moms enjoy a prix fixe lunch. The staff informed us the menu is even designed so that all the food can be eaten with one hand while the other holds the babe. No where near motherhood myself, I still thought this was a very thoughtful and fun idea. If you take issue with occasional squealing child, I'd recommend sitting in the south part of the lounge or in the cafe across the hall. For my part, I wasn't bothered at all and enjoyed watching all the pudgy faced new humans squirm around while their moms chatted. 

3) After checking with our server, we learned its totally chill to post up in your booth post-nosh and get a little laptop work done. The lounge is quiet enough mid-week, mid-afternoon it didn't feel like we were hogging a table at all. 

As always, the food and coffee were good and the service was friendly. My lunch companion's smoked salmon on her bagel was cooked which we both thought was weird, but otherwise no complaints, and I will be back again and again to this dependable neighbourhood spot."}
{"text":"I live on Queen St. West. I'm literally right by the Drake :) so I might be biased. It's convenient to go chill & dine. I love the upstairs patio. The food is good. The drinks are good. I never had to wait more than 15 minutes to be seated. It's good for groups, dates and alone dining."}
{"text":"I came here for the Summerlicious dinner menu with a few friends this Saturday and ordered the Green Gazpacho to start, Ricotta Gnocchi for my main, and The Drake Flourless Chocolate Cake for dessert. Overall, the meal was deecnt and all of the plates came with an element of surprise. However, I had slight issues with most of the meal. The gazpacho was very refreshing and tasty, though the sizing of the portions was far too large. The gnocchi was excellent and full of flavour, though the mushrooms were a tad too salty. Sad to say, the dessert, though creative, was a tad on the sweet side, with nothing to balance out the rich flavours. Hope that the regular menu proves better!"}
{"text":"I like the art in the lounge.  As I sat in the bar waiting for my table I watched as a clown made the sloppiest drinks I'd ever seen in my life.  A guy at the bar ordered a $20-$25 shot of some whiskey and said clown split it, and served him a wet glass.  He looked at me for my reaction, and I simply said 'that's what happens when you hire a clown.'

The hostess arrived and I was super excited to jump off my stool with my weirdo Shirley Temple that has orange juice in it ($4).  I was lead through the entrance, out the front door, back in the front door, back through the host stand, behind the staircase ( and I had to carry my own drink!)... until I was seated in what felt like a diner.

At least I was away from the clown.  

My server was a pretty girl who was attentive, and let me order things the way I wanted.  Even being gluten free I couldn't help but wreck my GI for the day by getting chicken and waffles.  I mentioned I was from the Southern part of the states and this is a very common food for us, so I was excited to try it again-  BOY WAS I WRONG lol. 

It's not bad, it's just an... interpretation of chicken and waffles.  Herb waffles with chicken strips covered in a cherry sauce, and creme fraiche.  Lol Ludacris would roll over in his grave if he were dead.  

The chicken fingers were good.  The waffle was okay (i took it home for pups).  I had more fun dipping the bacon in maple syrup than anything.

I'll be back as I love the ambience, and have a friend crush on my waitress, and hope to see her again, and make friends."}
{"text":"What to try?!

More like what to experience! Drake hotel is known for their lively atmosphere and open space. There's an upstairs, a main room and the basement. All open for you to roam while you hold a drink. 

I love drakes hotel's overall atmosphere. Tamed, low key, and a great place to bring your friends for a few drinks. I would say the crowd is also on the mature side. The patio upstairs is nice because it's an open patio so on a good summer night, it's not too hot and you get some fresh air while you enjoy the night. 

The cocktails here are nice too. I had the Palero spritz which was refreshing and easy to drink. We also had the angel food cake with strawberries on top which was light, not too sweet and very delicious.  

Last tip?

There's a $10 cover charge. Some VIP booth sections limit the areas you can take a seat. Try the cocktails, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I loved and hated my stay here. I loved it because it was centrally located in a super cool neighborhood, all the staff were friendly and the rooftop bar was great. The hotel is super hip and has lots of quirky attributions, like funky art and some really fab small touches, like two bottles of champagne and a bag of popcorn upon entry into your room. Loved that.

So then we come to the room. The hate. Really the hate was the bathroom/shower situation. If you are not comfortable doing your biznas in front of others... With the door open, don't stay here. I repeat, DO NOT STAY HERE. I am one of those peeps that needs my privacy. I don't fault you if you let it all out in front of your loved ones. I admire your confidence. 

However, I like a wall and closed door when I have my bathroom time. Get my point? The room is small to begin with, which is not a surprise for a boutique hotel, and not really an issue. The real issue is the bathroom and shower are all glass, with the SLIGHTEST frost over a portion of the glass. But you can see EVERYTHING even with the frost... And hear EVERYTHING. Again, if that bothers you, this hotel is not for you.

Also, we stayed on floor 2 of the 3 floors of this hotel and this is NOT a quiet hotel once nightfall hits. If you like to party and/or stay up late night and hear pulsating music... You'll be good to go. If your head hits the pillow by 10ish and you're a light sleeper, forget going to bed. The sweet sounds of Pitbull will not lull you to sleep. 

If I was staying alone I'd absolutely stay here again. If I was coming with a friend/family member, no way. I feel bad because I really did like the hotel other than that fact. Which in my world, is a big issue. My bathroom door is always closed. Sorry folks."}
{"text":"Great experience!

Very cool atmosphere, super friendly staff and good music. The cocktails were creative and made with care.

The food was tasty and the portions were healthy.

I would recommend this place if I knew others were coming (if I have to come back to Toronto, I may stay here!).

{"text":"Came here 10pm on a Saturday with reservations. I ordered a Drake Burger which was delicious and filling and I LOVED that the milk buns were soft and savoury. We also ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria to share, there was a good amount of alcohol in it & just enough fruity sweetness (although no real fruits were in it).

There's no need to pay cover for the clubbing portion of the night on the main floor, upper deck, & the underground since we had reservations & ordered food that night. The tables on the dance floor cleared by 11pm and we had space to enjoy the music and dance! I loved the music played by DJ Nana, he had a really good mashup of recent & early 2000's hip hop jams. The crowd was mixed but more on the mature mid 20's-30's. The bouncers were also nice at the Drake Hotel."}
{"text":"I think people can be particularly hard on the Drake as it has become a bit of an institution. I do agree that the brunch is not the best in the city (although solid) and that it can be over hyped but there are many good nights to be had here.  They do a good job of bringing in live music/entertainment and their rooftop patio is one of the best in the city..  Their food is always good if not amazing and they have a good selection of drinks.  All in all, its a bit of everything choice that is safe to fall back on."}
{"text":"I felt a bit honored to stay in a place designated as one of the Top 500 Hotels in the World. I'm not exactly sure what the process is for selection, but I did thoroughly enjoy my stay here at The Drake, and that's what really matters. My satisfaction.

The \"CrashPad\" was predictably tiny (and not all that cheap), but then again, I don't need much room. The important elements were all intact: great shower, great bed, and great service from an almost shockingly cheery desk clerk. However, that might just be due to her Canadianness. I hear you people are better than us in every way. 

Speaking of, sustainability seems to be a priority around here (as it should be), so I'm not upset about not walking out with tiny shampoo bottles I'll never use. And to be honest with you, I felt downright pampered by the huge bottles of cilantro conditioner, bergamot bodywash, and particularly the peppermint shampoo. I know everyone thinks I'm a man's man,* but I do like to smell nice. 

I do have one minor complaint, Drake; why do you stock the world's scratchiest tissues? I thought my nose was going to bleed after using one, and then I'd have to explain to my boss (again) that it's not what it looks like, I haven't been doing cocaine on the job.

*Nobody thinks this."}
{"text":"This place is expensive but for the experience you get - worth it. 

You can eat a good meal on the main floor and then into the evening turn to cocktails as the crowd starts to pile in. It has an upstairs that is more like a lounge and downstairs is like a club. 

We have went a few times for my birthday and always leave having had a great time."}
{"text":"Uber trendy yet understated is what I would say to describe this boutique hotel and restaurant. Decked from floor to ceiling are bookshelves with old-timey books and records that perfectly coincide with the retro looking sitting area at the front of the restaurant.

Big booths that line the main wall across from the expansive bar welcome you in with their dark wood and warm overhead lighting. Looking around, I notice a very clean and retro style, yet without forcing the notion of mid-century design (if that makes any sense) Essentially - the decor is effortlessly thrown together in a perfect collaboration of varying style. 

The menu, though small, showcases a lot of different dishes. Like, huevos rancheros and free form lasagna all under the entree category. Seeking something savory, I opted for the lasagna and was not disappointed. It was delicious and a perfect portion with tasty sausage and eggplant combined with fresh ricotta. If only I lived in Toronto, I could have taken home the leftovers."}
{"text":"The Drake is a cultural hub in my hood, and I've been coming here for various reasons for about a decade, so I have to toss it some five star lovin'. 

Once upon a time I came for lots of shows in the underground and drank too much on the roof on the regular. Then it became a place I'd recommend to friends visiting Toronto, because their boutique hotel rooms are cute and reasonably priced. Now, it's usually a brunch stop. If you're ready to eat at 11am when they open, you're pretty much guaranteed a couch seat in the sun, and their brunch is always sublime. Lately, I'm a huge fan of their warm scones and meat sides. Gititgitit. 

Whether you want to dance, sleep or dine this place is an institution, and you should check it out."}
{"text":"Drake Hotel is a place where I would go for brunch occasionally if I can't decide where else to eat. The restaurant has a comfortable, cozy, and hip vibe and lineups are encountered during busy times during the summer. 

Only ever having gone for brunch, you can't miss out on their chicken and waffles (one of my faves in the city!), eggs benny, avocado toast or smoked salmon bagel. Might I add that the yogurt/granola and scones are also great. Service is usually friendly and sitting out on the patio on a hot summer Sunday is also great for people watching. 

Overall, I've gone here many times and will likely be back for more."}
{"text":"This review is for the cocktail bar only.

The cocktail bar at the downstairs restaurant at the Drake Hotel is just lovely. 

The drinks are a little on the pricey side ($13-$16 on average), but they are quite good. The cocktail menu is full of quirky and mostly original recipes. One cute one that I tried is called \"Beets by Drake,\" a punny alcoholic twist on Beats by Dre. 

The bar is stocked with quality liquors and a number of boutique labels. But, most importantly, the bartender (at least on the night I was there) is a skilled mixologist. Beyond the standard mixed drinks, there is a lot of care that goes into making all sorts of complicated cocktails.

The bartender is incredibly friendly and helpful. He chatted with me as I waited for my friends, taking time to recommend drinks. When my friend arrived and didn't know what to order, the bartender asked what types of drinks my friend liked, then came back with the Corpse Reviver #2. It was herby and just a little sweet. Neither my friend nor I had tried it before and it was a huge hit. So much so that I'll be sure to get it again.

The bar/lounge is a great place for hanging out with friend and chatting. It's cozy and chill, but with an upscale hipster sort of vibe. It's a great place to go when you feel like being a little bit fancy, but don't want to actually dress up fancy.

Love this place. Can't wait to go back. 

(Just be aware that if you are drinking more than a few, the cost adds up quickly!)"}
{"text":"I came in on a Friday night for drinks and dinner. The dining room is located just off to the right when you walk in.
It's a pretty hip looking space, the back wall has a bookcase stacked with all kinds of knick knacks, trinkets, and old radios. It definitely screams Hipster in here. The tables by the window are located a step up from the main ground and we were lucky to get a table on this higher level by the window with views of Queen street.

Our waitress was very cheery and bubbly and explained that tonight they were having there Summer Kick Off Party which was Carnival themed so they had a Tarot card reader and staff dressed like gypsies/carnies and free cotton candy. They were also featuring some menu specials (mini corn dogs, pickle on a stick) and some special summer cocktails. We decided to try out some of the new summer cocktails.

The Lemon Song - Gin, Muddled Thyme, Lemonade
Refreshing, more sour than sweet, the slight taste of thyme was interesting but melded well with the lemonade

Rum & Raspberry Lemonade - Rum, Muddle Raspberry, Mint, Lemonade
Loved this! If definitely hit the spot! Very boozy they didn't skimp at all here, sweet & sour taste, reminded me of a mojito with the addition of the mint. 

Appetizer
Nicoise Tuna Tartare - taggiasca olive oil, shallots, anchovy, w/ cherry tomatos, green beans & potato chips
Fresh tasting, loved the diced olives mixed into the tartar and the warm homemade chips were the perfect vessel

I was surprised to see in the Dining room beside the bar two sushi chefs creating fresh rolls to order so I couldn't pass up trying at least one. Our waitress recommended we give them a try and was really helpful in helping us select rolls.

Grilled Arctic Char Maki w/ shiitake, pickled ginger + scallion in soy paper
As per our waitress suggestion we decided to go with the traditional seaweed wrapped rolls as she said the soy paper wrap has a funny taste for those not used to it. 8 pieces to a order, fresh cooked fish, mild taste with a burst of flavour provided by the ginger

Cumbrae's Striploin Nigiri w/ scallion, teriyaki + sesame
The meat literally melted in your mouth! So tender and flavourful, I just wish it came with more than four pieces to an order.

Dessert
Malt Chocolate Ice Cream Sandwich w/peanut butter oat cookies + hot fudge sauce
3 mini baby sandwiches served with yummy dollop of fresh whipped cream. The sandwiches were a little hard to eat as they were quite crumbly, a spoon is definitely needed to crack them and scoop up all the goodness other than I thoroughly enjoyed them. 

Tea came with a hand filled bag of leaves which I always appreciate.

After about 10pm a DJ set up and started playing some good house/dance music.
Overall a great night out at the Drake! A great place for drinks and definitely try out there sushi menu!

FYI Green P Parking located directly across from the Drake."}
