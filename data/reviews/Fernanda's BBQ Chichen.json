{"text":"BBQ chicken was tender and juicy. Salad was fresh and many combinations to choose from. Cod fish with potatoes was uniquely delicious. I love this place. It's these kind of small unique places that prepare food with care and love."}
{"text":"I had 1/2 Chicken with Rice and Potatoes. $ 11.50

This is a new place it was not that busy. That means how fresh is your meal
The one I had was okay It was not sitting to long. It was hot and tasty.
I think the price is a bit high. They are charging what other Big Portugese  places are charging. And they are not at the same scale where they are.
They should drop there price.
For the same price I will go to other Portugese chicken Places."}
{"text":"A family run Portuguese restaurant.  As previous reviewer states, it was brand new back in '11 but it ain't brand new now.  Good sign they're still around after 2 years in a strip mall that houses a million other eateries.  Chicken, rice and potatoes are always a good start but make sure you come early.  They run out of the good stuff by early dinner time.  A good sign as you can always expect fresh batch the following day.  The owners are great too."}
