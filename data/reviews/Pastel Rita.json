{"text":"I love cafes and I love creativity even more so when I heard about this amazing concept I had to take the time to visit. Located in the heart of the Mile-End, Pastel Rita is not only a Third Wave bright little café, it is also a creative space for local designers (hi Bouquet!). 

I arrived around 9, and it already had a group of people brainstorming and enjoying coffees. I ordered a Moka and a croissant, both were very well done... I stayed a while and looked at the trendy work around (I will definitely go back to get a few items). 

In short, I enjoyed everything about my experience, from the welcoming Dalmatians (yep, you'll see) to the decor (the fixtures are on point), I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Made Here.

New to the hood cafe with consciously sourced, mostly locally, product. Fresh muffins and croissants. Soup. Barista coffee, tea, hot coco. 

Beautiful bright space., (was La Castiglione's space) shared with a sister biz; \"bouquet\", three artisans; a milliner, a leather purse maker and a jeweller. 

Great ambient music. 
Great vibes. 
Check it."}
{"text":"I love this new café in the neighbourhood, filling in a spot that helps unite Mile End and Mile Ex and gives a big bright, friendly, inspiring option for delicious hangs. Named after the owner's Grandma it was always already going to speak to my heart, and then the warmth of the welcome and the delicious homemade snacks made with ingredients from local producers pushed me to full swoon. I loved my little local honey bar and tasty coffee, and watching the artisans who share the space shaping hats and cutting leather made me feel inspired. Can't wait to come back and spend some time and soak in the maker vibes."}
{"text":"Such a sunny, beautiful café with good vibes all around. Lots to see, with three artisans' workshops making great use of the natural light. Comfy window seats for working on your own projects. Oh, and the coffee is top-notch, third-wave goodness."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and quaint. It's a small coffee bar inside an artist collective. There is art, jewelry and a hat maker along with an exceptional espresso menu and local pastries from the bakery down the street. The best part is they also have a parking lot, so you don't have to look for street parking.

Sebastian is awesome! Great barista and conversationalist."}
