{"text":"Glad to see that the \"Original Congee\" (????) location has re-opened as \"Happy Congee\" (??) inside the Middlefield & Steeles Food court (formerly the T&T plaza)!  They still have the freshly made Chinese dough sticks????and the menu remains the same.    Thanks to Jennifer K 's info that the Original Congee owner is opening up a new store in the same plaza but not inside the food court.  However, its interesting that the cashier told me they are from the Original Congee."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  A good and cheap congee place inside the food court section of Fresh Field Supermarket. As I mentioned in my earlier review for Original Congee which is also in the same plaza, this place excels in a couple areas in comparison to it.  The dough sticks are by far the best that I have had anywhere and the rice rolls have great texture, especially the plain ones. The vegetables with oyster sauce are fresh and nicely steamed.  Will definitely be coming back here often and try some of their other dishes as well."}
{"text":"Happy Congee is one of the food court vendors in the food court inside the Field Fresh grocery store. It is definitely the most popular one (longest lineups), but I'm not sure why, as I was not crazy about the food there.  I went with my parents and we got food from 2 places, Happy Congee being one of them. We got an order of Shrimp Rice Rolls ($3.10), a Chinese donut ($1.50) and an order of Pork Pudding and Minced Beef Congee ($4.50).  They accidentally gave us Preserved Egg and Minced Beef Congee instead but my parents didn't realize it until they ate part of it. Dad doesn't like to make a fuss, so he just ate it anyway. My mom said it was one of the worse congee she's ever had. She said it was so bland and she regretted buying it. I don't like congee so I didn't have any.  However, my mom loved the Chinese donut. She said it was so crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They make them there in front of you so you can see. They are fried in this gigantic vat of oil!   The shrimp rice rolls were ok, but lacking in shrimp. They were hot and the rolls were chewy and not too thick, but at $3.10 I didn't feel like they were much of a deal considering I got another order of shrimp rice rolls from the dim sum counter inside Field Fresh and those were only $2.59 and they had much more shrimp.  I guess I would just recommend this place for their Chinese donuts, not their congee.  Congee 1 star, Chinese donuts 4 stars, shrimp rice rolls 3 stars, so overall 3 stars (rounding up)."}
{"text":"I swing by to pick up some veggies and meat to bring to my friend's house for hotpot. Boy was I lucky, they were just making the sesame balls and Chinese doughnut fresh! I waited and watched the whole process.  The sesame balls and Chinese doughnut was so tasty. I filmed the whole process!   Worth a try."}
{"text":"We wanted to come to the grocery store this congee place is located in so we had breakfast as well. We got the minced beef and plain rice noodle (cheung fun) combo for $6.55 (tax included). The congee came in those take out soup containers and boy was it fresh. The fresh peanuts were so crunchy and the beef was so flavourful. The congee was also so so so so hot. I definitely burnt my tongue a few times. But the congee was just too good. The rice noodle on the other had was a little too thick and chewy for my liking. It came out hot but I didn't like the texture. This congee place is in the food court so its self serve. Seperately the minced beef congee is $3.80+tax and cheung fun $2.80+ tax, so youre just saving a bit with the combo. I would definitely come back and just get the congee and the fried donut next time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get Chinese dough sticks, congee and roce fritter rolls.  This place is usually busy around lunch anstey time with people buying they're Chinese dough sticks. Located inside of field fresh supermarket which was once T and T supermarket.  Only thing I would have to say about the dough sticks or that they are more saltier than they were since field fresh supermarket opened up.  New recipe I wonder? But other than that solid for stars."}
{"text":"I am quite happy with Happy Congee. We ordered one noodle soup ($5), one lo mein (noodle without soup) ($6), one spicy tofu snack and one dried shrimp cheung fun (rice roll).  Both noodles tasted quite good, and were well portioned. If factoring in the prices, the deal was excellent.  I dare say it is pretty hard to find value at this level in Markham/Richmond Hill (this place is just across the street from Markham, so Markhamites will patronize too).  The tofu tasted meh, and the cheung fun tasted average.  But at their absurdly low prices (below $3 each) and above average portion, the Scrooge in me told me to stop complaining.  The cold soya beverages have been diluted.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Happy Congee is the new congee stall that took over when the original owner moved into Original Congee just outside.  Serving congee, fried cruellers, noodles and other similar fare its a great option to pick up food on the go.    I still prefer Original Congee as I find the taste better and that the hygiene practice of Happy Congee is not the best (they handle cash then work on noodles and stuff) so would still rather go to Original Congee for my congee fix.   3/5."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located in the food court of Field Fresh Supermarket near Steeles Ave. E and Middlefield Rd. Plenty of parking spots at the plaza.   [SERVICE] - 5/5 The staff really knew how to manage the crowd and were also quick and efficient when we visited this spot during the lunch rush.   [DÃ‰COR] - 4/5  I liked the concept of the transparent glass panel, which allowed us to see the chefs deep fry dough sticks and create other delicious foods.   [QUALITY] - 4/5 Quality of rice rolls were pretty great for a food court stall. The dough stick could have been a little crispier, but tasted fresh overall.    [ORDER] - 4/5 - Beef Congee with Plain Rice Roll Combo - $5.80: definitely worth the price for a cheap, filling, and delicious breakfast. Beef congee was a little salty, but plain rice roll tasted so soft and paired so well with hoisin sauce, peanut sauce, sesame seeds, and chilli oil on the side.   - Rice Roll with Dough Stick - $2.80: very inexpensive and comforting. Dough stick was definitely fresh but not crispy enough in my opinion.   - Shrimp Rice Roll - $2.95: shrimp was delicious and paired well with the rice roll   [OVERALL] - 4/5 I would highly recommend Happy Congee for simple, affordable, and delicious congee and rice rolls. I really enjoy how you can customize your own condiments because I can cover my rice rolls in that delicious hoisin sauce, peanut sauce, and chilli oil."}
{"text":"I am so Happy that Happy Congee is open for business in the food court area of Field Fresh Supermarket (Old T&T).   #1 Beef Congee and Plain Rice Roll ($5.50) always my order to go combo. To celebrate for the first snow storm for Winter 2016, I decided to order a fried dough! Freshly from the fryer, went so well with the congee.  Cash Only!"}
