{"text":"Basically a Longhorn with a little veneer on it. Went in just for dessert and sat at the bar. Waited half an hour while the entire staff, including the manager, sat in front of us watching the Panther game."}
{"text":"Sadly after 3 visits the service is not better.  Today we timed 42 minutes to get our drinks from the bar.  Our food came out and we asked for silverware and waited 11 minutes with our food getting colder and being attacked by flies before our silverware.  Oh how I wanted this place to be a new favorite but sadly that's not going to happen."}
{"text":"I made a reservation at Ted's Montana Grill for Mother's Day a week before the holiday. We waited 25 minutes to be seated after our reservation time and only because my husband made a stink. A couple ahead of me at the front said he called ahead 45 minutes ago and then got seated right away. Should I have called ahead or made a reservation? The salmon I ordered was over cooked, the sweet potato was the smallest potato I have ever seen and the cesear salad had no taste. My aunt's hamburger was supposed to be medium rare. It came well done. Our server Jason was the only Bright spot of the evening."}
{"text":"Very nice staff! Good food. All steaks are good. Nice drink selections. Parking isn't good currently (but that might change if a parking deck is finished soon). Fancy-yet relaxing atmosphere. Awesome deserts. U shd get a reservation or plan on waiting an hour for a table on Saturday or Sunday."}
{"text":"Great! Our food was amazing and great service and fries were crunchy burgers were huge and amazing and hot   We had teds in Florida and were looking forward to it ."}
{"text":"Brick tops or 131 main prices Wendy's food and service  No parking Restroom not clean Server was lost Ted should be ashamed"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here. We were seated and the server came by to give us water then we never saw her again. There are so many other good restaurants in the area. Don't waste your time here. There is a reason the reviews are bad. Can't wait for them to go out of business so a better place can come instead."}
{"text":"Our first experience with Ted's was in Atlanta where we found the food fare good and fair.   The new Charlotte location is getting their kinks out with menu consistently and service however this should correct itself with time.   The bison bias menu is good but not great. The kids menu as well the normal menu is made from scratch; found that important.   Overall, the Charlotte location will be a good place once they have more time under their belt."}
{"text":"This is a great American steakhouse and has good service.  The meatloaf is great!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Well, I am giving a 2 star because when you go here and pay these prices you would expect, not only great food but great service as well.  I returned my burger not once, but twice, because there were some hard cartilage like substance in my bison burger, then when when it was remade, same deal. They did offer me another meal and they did take the charges off. My son had a different entree and it was great. So, just do not order the bison.   The service was less than stellar. I didn't have my water refilled even once. I had about 5 glasses in front of me due to the rest of our party passing me their waters to drink. No ones glass was refilled during dinner except for my son, who took his glass to the back area and asked for a refill. So, I would say that this is not a hit."}
{"text":"The only reason Ted'$ is getting three stars is because of the service. The waiters were polite but the food took forever to get to my table, even a glass of water it took like twenty minutes and I was seated next to the kitchen! The food was really good overall and the deserts are great. I suggest going here but maybe have a snack before you get here because you'll need to wait awhile for the food."}
{"text":"A bunch of screaming kids, poor uncaring service.  The food was mediocre at best. Hopefully they work out the kinks and find better cooks/servers."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant in charlotte.  The bison is delicious.  But leave room for the shakes."}
{"text":"Had a meal with friends here a few weeks ago.  Very underwhelming.  Go one more exit up to Firebirds and get a well cooked meal.  Steak was like a old shoe and sides tasted like Boston Market."}
{"text":"Our first visit for lunch was excellent!  I had a burger and onion rings and my wife had a salad.  The food was tremendous and service was top notch.  The atmosphere is really nice... no kids running around like you find in many of the Lord of the Flies restaurants in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"Although not officially open, we had lunch here today. We have never been to a Ted's or had Bison. We ate at the bar but took a walk around and really like the set up of the restaurant. The staff was all very friendly, service was great and all of the food we had was delicious. We started with Bison Sliders and for entrees chose the Absolute Best Fish Sandwich w/ Fries and Onion Rings and The Big Sky Grilled Salad w/ Bison. We also got Snickerdoodle and Double Chocolate cookies to go. Haven't eaten them yet but sure they won't disappoint. Excited to have another place open here. We are in walking distance and I am sure we will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Didn't realize it was a \"Bison\" focused restaurant. While they do have beef steak, they are a bison focused restaurant. Needless to say, it was good food."}
{"text":"Great food and service..clean and comfortable environment... friendly smiling faces. When I'm in town this is my favorite spot"}
{"text":"Food was not good. This is our second time and the second time they comped our food.   We asked to speak to a manager, and our waiter let us know, he was busy in the kitchen. We waited over an hour for our food. And it was just ok It actually ruined our night  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We missed going to Ted's Montana Grill when we were in Colorado, so I was excited to learn that one opened here in Charlotte!  It's located in this entirely new up-and-coming area in South Charlotte.    We went on a Friday night around 8:00 PM and were told about a 40 minute wait.  After about 50 minutes, we were thinking about walking over to Chuy's next door because everyone had been seated except for us.  Just as we were about to do that, we received a text letting us know that our table was ready.    The ambiance felt \"just ok.\"  It didn't feel special or themed.  After waiting for so long, I also needed to visit the little boys' room (and wanted to wash my hands), so I tried to do that before we ordered.  There was ONE urinal that was placed next to the sink and ONE gigantic stall where someone from the kitchen was apparently taking a big dump break (his apron was flung over the door).  There were also other people waiting.  Seriously--for a brand new, large restaurant, they put in one non-private urinal and one toilet for their customers and employees to share?    Anyway, now that I've discussed the restroom situation, let's talk about food.  Bison is their specialty, and they have a big menu filled with a variety of burger and steak options.  They also offer salads, chicken, turkey, fish, and regular burgers if you're not up for bison.  We were so hungry after sitting down that we ordered wedge salads to start.  They were delicious and hit the spot.  Fortunately, the rest of our meal (burgers) arrived not too long afterwards.  I tried the Avalon -- gruyère, blue cheese, bacon caramelized onions, roasted garlic aioli, and baby arugula.  I noticed that the onions weren't very hot, but dove right into the sandwich.  The bison was delicious and juicy, but the bun was pretty thick and bland and somewhat detracted from the sandwich innards.    As we were eating, my partner mentioned that the fries were kinda cold and soggy.  I was so hungry that I didn't notice at first, but he was right.  Surprisingly, he mentioned it to our server, because he never says anything.  She brought us a plate of hot fries to share.  They were hot, but still felt like they were a little old or something.  They didn't have that freshness crisp.  All in all, it was an ok first experience, and but for the prices ($17 for a burger) I'm not sure we'd come back.  We wouldn't have a problem paying that price if everything was top-notch, but it just wasn't.  They need to get some better quality and flavorful burger buns, serve everything HOT, up their fry game, accept reservations, and offer better bathroom facilities.  The service was great, though, despite the (too) long wait to be seated.  (They also had a 90 health inspection rating posted by the door, which is almost a B.)"}
{"text":"When the restaurant first opened the service and the food were great.  We were excited to have a nice burger restaurant close to home.  Then the last four times I've been there... the service is slow and inexperienced, seems like there's a lot of turnover already, the bar is short staffed, what ever happened to the complimentary pickles, and the food has been cold the last 2 times.  We keep trying to give them chances but unfortunately, my husband and I have decided that Friday night was our last visit."}
{"text":"Good waiter, lousy food.  Instead of bison burgers med rare, we got bison tartare. The limp, luke warm fries and unripe tomatoes went nicely with other bad food. The menu is nice, the food not so much. They need a new manager because not all Teds are this bad."}
{"text":"I took a friend of mine there for his birthday per his request. Neither of us had been to a TMG before. It took the waiter, Andy, about 5 minutes to take our drink order once seated. We also ordered a side of Onion Rings. They came out rather timely and were delicious. We each ordered our bison burgers and they came out in a timely manner, also very good. My problem was with our waiter. He not only lacked a friendly personality, but also a lack of customer service. We needed refills on our tea almost immediately after the burgers were brought out. We assumed he noticed that, so didn't verbally mention it. He walked by our table numerous times, glaring right at our empty glasses but never made a mention of bringing us a refill. I gave him the benefit of the doubt the first time, but it happened over and over. After nearly 15 minutes without a drink, and 1 bite away from finishing my burger, he finally decided to acknowledge the fact and asked us if we needed refills. We said YES, naturally and then it took another 5 minutes for him to bring those out. By this time we were done with this jerk. We were so frustrated at his lack of customer care, I just told him to bring the check. His tip reflected his poor service. I will never go back, and will not recommend Teds as long as they hire dolts like this. And to make things clear here. This was not some new waiter, still in training. In fact, he seemed rather knowledgeable, with a certain stern cockiness that was a turn-off almost immediately. But I always give wait staff a benefit of the doubt at first. But when it's glaringly evident we were singled out for his bad service, is when I have problems."}
{"text":"this was my first visit to Ted's Montana and my first time eating bison and I must say it was pretty good. Our server was very nice she was very attentive."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it two stars for the Jalapeño margarita and the server. The food took far too long to come out for a restaurant that empty, we even asked our server if they went to Montana for our steaks. The roasted Parmesan broccoli was not roasted, and had no Parmesan. Worst part, my salmon ceasar salad was straight out of a fast food establishment - down to the powdered Parmesan. My advice, give it a miss."}
{"text":"The bison burger and fries were both incredible. Bison short ribs were better than ok but I wouldn't order again-did not wow me. The special side of the day was some sort of cucumber/corn/asparagus mix that was a great idea but too much vinegar was used."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service. It is pricey though Bison meatloaf and burgers are fantastic"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Friendly employees! Every time my boyfriend and I go here we leave extremely happy and have a great experience! A +++++ for sure"}
{"text":"I've been to Ted's numerous times but this was my first time at this location. The food was good and the service was fantastic as it should've been because at the time I went it wasn't that busy. Two things I didn't like. My Meatloaf was small, it was the smallest portion I ever received since going to Ted's but I didn't say anything and I don't like the fact that they use powdered soap in the bathrooms to wash your hands. Other than that everything else was good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, but food was just ok.  Expect cucumbers in everything, first they bring you dish of cucumbers (smell was overpowering).  Chips and dip (dip had ranch and cucumbers).  Had Kansas City bison that was ok.  It must have been cooked in cast iron skillet because one side was burnt.  Garlic mashed potatoes good.  Squash casserole was good but dry - taste like squash with stove top stuffing.  Caesar salad taste like vinegarette with cucumber not that good.  Ice tea was delicious.  Our waiter was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!  We had bison Steak and burgers which were great.  Will definitely go there again and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I am not sure what to say about our recent visit to this restaurant except it was our 2nd and also our last visit unless they change their management here. We arrived at 6:30 pm and were seated promptly which was an indication they were not that busy. We were told after we ordered our drinks that they were out of their Sunday Turkey Special which seemed odd that they  would be out of their \"special\" at 7:00 pm. Oh well things went downhill from there.  After 50 mins waiting for our entre's, I went to ask the manager what was the problem.  It took about 5 mins for him to show up and he could have cared less about my questions on the lengthy wait for our food; why they ran out of their feature by 7:00 pm and basically why I had an issue at all. The last thing the manager said after grilling him on the poor service was \" we made need to ask you to leave\". Considering we were one of maybe 20 people left there at this time I assume he wanted to go home himself. I went back to my table which had just had our food delivered and found the following: my wife's bison filet overbooked; my friend's bison filet overcooked;  my meatloaf dry; mashed potatoes dry and tasteless, my squash casserole dry and tasteless as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 mins. After letting the waitress know how awful the late did was she offered a free dessert which I refused as patronizing and demeaning. I thought, that maybe the half assed manager might come to apologize for the terrible service but I guess he thought laying low was his responsibility. I have never had a manager of any business be so arrogant and uninterested in the crappy experience as Jordan was. This restaurant will not survive if Jordan is left as it's manager. He was an arrogant, uninterested, and could have cared less about our experience at this restaurant. Ted Turner would be ashamed that this restaurant has his name associated with it.  I travel extensively and eat out frequently and have rarely had such an awful experience at a restaurant that charges what Ted's Montana Grille at Waverely, Charlotte does. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Burger came out raw! Salad had maybe one ounce of chicken, when we spoke to the manager she asked if we had specifically ordered extra chicken. Not impressed with service, nor were we pleased with the way it was handled. We will not return."}
{"text":"My husband and I always enjoy eating here. We always say that we are going to branch out and try something different, but always wind up ordering one of their amazing bison burgers. The onion rings are thick, crispy and not terribly greasy and the French fries are tasty and fresh. I also enjoy their mojitos."}
{"text":"Super nice staff.  Red Beans and Rice very flavorful.  The chicken was moist with a cranberry glaze. Garlic Mash was just right.  The fresh squeezed lemonade was perfect. However the desserts were very good. Wild berry Cheesecake with real creme and the Apple pie was as good as any that you ever had.  Reasonable prices for the quality of food served, especially in this new trendy area of South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here with  bestie to check out this new restaurant.  Bar was packed and wait was 45 minutes.  1st observation - bartenders are not experienced to survey the bar and see who is new or to even make a mixed cocktail.  We ordered martinis (cosmo and dry martini) after waiting T the bar for 20 minutes.  Bartenders avoided eye contact with patrons who just stepped to the bar.  Heard several folks noticing the same.  Once we were seated, our bartender began to check in on us.  He was pleasant and respectful.  We also noticed the staff spent more time talking with each other vs focusing on the customer.  The food was not seasoned well and was disappointing given the price.  I think this team needs to mature a bIt and stRt focusing on the folks coming through the door!  Doubtful that we will return."}
{"text":"Review based on my visit on the 2nd official day of opening to the public 04-27-17  Service: (5/5 stars) Andy was my server and he did an exceptional job at explaining and educating my family on why ranch-raised bison meat is at the core of the menu. Here are the highlights on what I learned.   Who is Ted in Ted's Montana Grill? It's Ted Turner, media mogul (founder of CNN / TBS). He is one of the largest land owners in the US with 15 ranches, 1.9 million acres. (Source: Wikipedia...who know's if it's really accurate but if it's even close that's pretty impressive) Why is this relevant for the review? All the bison meat served come from his farms. Notice the American flag in the middle of the burger in the album. I love cuisines that have a story.   So after the formalities of getting drinks; which by the way they serve Boylan Cane Sugar Sodas and glass Coca-Cola products and hand-crafted drinks, we received what my niece calls not really pickle pickles. Our server Andy stated they're actually called \"Half Sours\" (4.65 / 5 Stars...see picture as I linked to the cucumber supplier that actually sells this to the public). Instead of vinegar like normal pickles these are infused with garlic and cured in a basic salt and purified water brine, with a hint of bay leaf, black peppercorn, coriander, mustard seed, all spice, dill, and cinnamon bark, enhancing the natural fresh taste of the cucumber. It's totally complimentary and comes automatically in-lieu of baked bread like other places.   Eco-Friendliness:  1.) Earth friendly straws. A stash of straws are conveniently next to the typical salt and pepper shakers. What a nice customer experience to not having to wait for the server to give it to you.   2.) So being the great uncle that I am I wanted to ensure my niece and I wash our hands before we dive into our meal. Why in the world am I bringing this up? Well, my niece and I immediately commented how different the soap felt. They have Boraxo powdered soap. Being the inquisitive consumer that I am I researched and the brand claims it contains no phosphates, is 100% soluble, wont clog drains or harm fixtures, and are gentle on hands. It smelled just fine and I can see it being used by mechanics and those that need to do a deep hand cleaning. NOTE: I didn't want to take a picture of the actual soap dispenser in the bathroom...don't want to be that tacky and weird guy taking pictures where one should never take pictures. Instead, I took a screenshot of the Boraxo wikipedia entry in my photo album.   So let's start with the starter...Bison Nachos (4.25 / 5 Stars). My family love nachos and these definitely rank as one of the best in Charlotte. The cheese was creamy and didn't solidify and look like plastic like some of the other chain restaurants I've been to. The portion size was really big and for only $ 9 I see the value in the price point. I may consider this as a take-out item to snack on at home to watch a game or movie night.   For the main courses I'll outline and rate each item.   Bison Pot Roast (3/5 stars)...what I really wanted was the Bison Short Ribs but the menu clearly says...Saturday Only...so the next closest dish would be what I ordered. Honestly, this wasn't my favorite. It was good just not great. Granted, pot roast is pretty basic and the gravy is what you would expect. It just didn't pop with any distinct flavors.   Garlic mashed potatoes (3.25 / 5 stars) it was fine. Obviously fresh and the garlic was subtle and not over done.   Roasted Asparagus (3.5 / 5 stars) It was cooked just fine. It wasn't soggy or over cooked. Flavor was subtle and a bit smoky. You can't go wrong with this side dish.  Avalon Bison Burger (4.75 / 5 stars)...talk about a tender piece of meat. The second I held up the burger the meat was juicy and felt like it was ready to pull apart and melt in your mouth. If this is what a burger is like I can't wait to try the bison steak next time. With quality ingredients like gruyere, blue cheese, bacon caramelized onions, roasted garlic aioli, and baby arugula you enjoy each and every flavor in this well thought out menu item. I had mine cooked medium which was just perfect.   50/50 Fries & Onion Rings (4.15 / 5 stars - fresh and battered and just the right amount of saltiness. Andy hooked us up with what is likely a house-made horseradish sauce to dip our onion rings in. What a considerate suggestion as it nicely balanced the overall flavor.   Kahlua Fudge Brownie (4.25 / 5 stars...caramel sauce, coffee icing, Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, Kahlua fudge sauce) Seriously, how can you go wrong with fudge + ice cream. You can definitely taste the cocoa powder. The brownie itself was cooked just right and was still soft and moist. Andy indicated the only item they freeze is just the ice cream. No other ingredient in the restaurant is frozen as everything is scratch made and as fresh as possible.   Overall, good experience and will likely revisit to try the bison steak."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with high expectations and were terribly disappointed. Our appetizer was ok and then we waited for 20 minutes and our server brought out a plate with a few French fries and onion rings and said the kitchen was backed up. We (or anyone else around us) didn't see any service for about 40 minutes and they brought out food for other tables that were there before us. The manager didn't seem to care too much and we asked for our check so we could leave and get some food on the way home after sitting there for an hour and a half. While on the way out they brought us our food to go. When we got home and tried the steaks (beef filet and bison ribeye) they had no seasoning at all and were very undercooked. I realize this is a new restaurant and they need to work out the kinks but this was pretty ridiculous. Very disappointed we wasted a rare evening out without the kids."}
{"text":"love the place, but was very disappointed this past Sunday when we sat out on the patio to have lunch. A couple came up and was seated with a dog right beside us which we find very inappropriate for an upscale restaurant. We have and love animals,but we don't expect to eat with them. Please consider a policy change on this issue. Thank you."}
{"text":"I have visited your restaurant twice in the past week and really enjoyed the experience. I am a general manager for a local restaurant chain in the charlotte area and i wanted you to know about my visit. On my first visit we had Trevor as our sever and i must say he was one of the best severs I have ever came across. He was very attentive to our needs and very professional. On my second Visit I sat at the bar and had the chance to meet one of your managers jordan, he was very friendly and made us feel like family. He took great pride in his Job and making sure every customer received the best service possible. Thank you and I hope this gets back to both of the gentlemen who provided a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"We were told 10 minute wait & waited 30+ minutes. We went back inside to check on table bc they had several open tables & they said they had closed the kitchen.  At that point they said the wait could be a few hours.   We left. Very frustrated - they lost several groups of people when we shared with them what the hostess said."}
{"text":"Ehhh.... I feel like this place has great potential, but my first visit left me pretty disappointed.  I'm not sure if this place is understaffed or not, but my buddy and I probably waited for 10 minutes or so before our waitress took our drink order. Then another 10 for us to get them.    We ended up both ordering bison burgers... the presentation was great, the fries were the highlight of the meal and I could tell they were cooked fresh, but unfortunately my burger was way over cooked.  For almost $20 I was expecting a solid burger packed full of flavor and good burger juices.... I didn't get that at all...    If I do ever find myself in the Waverly area, I'll likely pick one of the many other places to eat."}
{"text":"Located in the Waverly shopping center this new eatery offers Bison. A delicious meat that boasts is leaner than regular beef With more flavor!  I don't know much about Bison but I've definitely got to tell you it's delicious!  I ordered Teds cheeseburger with a side of squash casserole. It was fabulous! A tad bit pricey but good.  The atmosphere is nice and the waitstaff are very eager to serve you!  I'm a fan ! Two thumbs way up Ted!"}
{"text":"First time customer and it was great! Great appetizers great meal good beer selection and great servers! The 4 stars are only because the parking and entrance are confusing!"}
{"text":"Great spot.  Saw the reviews but must have been because they just opened.  Try the bison burger."}
{"text":"A little nervous about this place after reading some of the reviews. We didn't have a reservation so I wasn't sure how long we would have to wait. We were told 20 mins but in 10 mins or so our table was ready. Our server Lydia was Awesome!!! She asked if this was our 1st time which it was. She was so excited about her restaurant and told us about how fresh made everything is. I had salmon my other guest had burgers. Everything was perfect. Great food ! Great service! Definitely $100 Bill Worthy."}
{"text":"Went there for my anniversary and wifes birthday recently in july.  Never having eaten there I looked up the menu, reviews, and health department score.  Reviews were mixed and score was awful at 90.5.  Figuring they were working out the kinks of a new place we went anyway.  Walking in the door we saw they were just scored again that day at 90.5.  Two bad scores in a a row.  Again we figured we'd try it.  Got sat cozying up to a pylon next to a large group of loud seniors arguing over who got what.  Nothing against seniors as I'm almost one of them but between the poor health scores, mixed reviews, and that scene out of a  Seinfeld episode it was time to leave.  Never got to.eat and probably never will go back."}
{"text":"I had never been to any Ted's locations, so I didn't know what to expect. I was anticipating a good steakhouse experience, given the price points (which don't bother me if the food and service is great, or even good). I sure wish I had something better to report . . .   My husband and I went out to lunch with our 5 year old on a Tuesday.   The first thing I noticed was the 90.3 health score. I'm not sure how a restaurant that has been open about 6 weeks can get a score lower than a fast food restaurant.  The hostess was very peppy and efficient, but it's clear she does have (or like?) children. She spoke to my son with a condescending tone, \"You need to sit down before I can give you the Wikki Stix.\" He was still scooting across the booth. I just chalk it up to inexperience with kids, so it wasn't too bad.  Once seated, I noted that Ted's is nicely decorated (nice paneling and tile foot)  and reminded me somewhat of the myriad steakhouses I used to visit when we lived in NYC.  Jordan was our server. We ordered unsweet tea with lemon and a soft drink for my son. I had to ask him for lemon when he served our drinks. Then 10 minutes later, my husband reiterated our request (with successful results).  Both my husband and I ordered the chopped salad as an appetizer. It was average and I would not recommend it. My husband ordered the bison steak and said that it was pretty good, though the cut seemed a little thin. Maybe that's how it's always done, I don't know. His fries were soggy and greasy.  I ordered the Red Rock chicken sandwich, with a side of tomatoes. The sandwich was okay, but I don't recommend the Z-sauce. The tomatoes were pink, crunchy, and devoid of flavor - inedible. That really surprised me.  The worst thing was the chicken noodle soup (of the day). Granted this is not a soup and salad place, so maybe we should have steered our son toward a slider or chicken fingers. By the time my husband had finished his meal, my slow-eating son had only eaten his oyster crackers, some fries and about 3 spoonfuls of soup. He wanted to know if \"maybe they don't put chicken in their soup on Tuesdays\". I searched - no chicken. Then I tasted it since he usually finishes soup. It was vile. My husband sampled it and made a wretch of face. Gummy noodles, no chicken, and super-gross flavor - I do not recommend it even if it were free and you were really hungry.   We noticed a manager (maybe?) checking on other patrons, but we were overlooked.   Jordan was inattentive given how few people were dining for lunch. I wonder if he just got home from college and hasn't had much time to learn the ropes. He asked how everything was when we were done. My husband said he enjoyed his, but that I didn't think the tomatoes were good at all and that the soup was also not good. *Crickets* (no response) On the plus side, Jordan surprised me when he brought the to-go cup for my husband, he also brought one for me. Unfortunately that didn't make up for the long intervals between visits to our table.  Bottom line: If you are looking to spend $80+ on a meal, without wine/alcohol, and you think that for that price you will get good food and good service, you will likely be very disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here! Started with 2 lemonades and some bison nachos. I had the bison ribeye and my husband had the bison meatloaf...both very good. Service was exceptional! Seriously Eric might be the best waiter we've ever had at any restaurant ever! Very cool place and atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food wins pretty good - but for over an hour the noise and yelling from the kitchen sounded like a bar fight.  The manager asked me how everything was and it was so loud she stopped and repeated herself - but did nothing to fix an obvious problem.  Definitely a one time meal."}
{"text":"Oh Ted's how we wanted to love you :(    The cucumbers in lieu of bread is a healthy alternative & very welcome.  Those were devoured quickly.  Since cucumbers are cheap esp when bought in bulk maybe offer another bowl like would be done with bread.  We had the homemade chips w/the french onion ranch dip dressing.  The best part was the french onion ranch dip dressing that I would love the recipe for - yummy!  I had a crab cake starter & a side chopped salad.  This was the perfect meal for a lighter size appetite.   The crab cake had something hard in it that resembled a unpopped popcorn kernel.  I thought I had lost part of one of my crowns when I bit into.  The portion size as an appetizer is truly meant for 1 person & was perfect as the lunch portion vs. an appetizer.  2 ppl would have the crab cake knocked out in a 1.5 bites a piece.  My better half had the bison delmonico ribeye with mashed potatoes & carrots.  The mashed potatoes & carrots were pretty pedestrian.  The bison delmonico ribeye there were very high expectations since meat is the reason for Ted's - it was dry, tough & apparently, it hadn't rested before it was served :(  Our server, Lyda, was fantastic - very helpful & smiley.  The service as a whole when the staff was on the floor was great.   What still seems to be fine tuning is off the floor in the kitchen because we were seated in a booth all the way opposite the kitchen & could hear the staff yelling at each other.   W/the signature meat not done well or done too well as the case my be & not sure what had landed in the crab cake, not sure when we will be returning to Ted's."}
{"text":"First time eating at Ted's! Best service I've had in a long time! The staff is very professional and they all seem to get along and work well together. Food and cocktails are delicious and so fresh! We will be eating here often!"}
{"text":"To begin, our server Cindy, was amazing! It was my birthday and she made me and my guests feel special.  I was not overly impressed with the meal. The short rib was flavorful but nothing to write home about.  But the part that really was upsetting was the portion. My plate was mostly carrots and mashed potatoes with a small rib set up on the bones to make it look larger.  I would not order this again.  But I will visit again because of the great service."}
{"text":"We were hoping after a month the restaurant had worked out their new opening bugs. Not so. Place was not that crowded and told 15 minutes for a party of two. That turned into 30-35, \"your next\". We started to see other parties seated and now they had lost our name. Finally took 45 minutes to be seated on a not crowded night.  Our waiter was polite and tried very hard but seemed to be overwhelmed with to many tables. He consistently made mistakes with our order and items were missing from our meal. Our water glasses stayed empty to long before he got back to us.   There were many open tables and people were still waiting to be seated so it seems they have a staffing problem with servers. Not once did we see anyone that resembled a manager or assistant manager trying to help out or resolve any problems. That's a problem in my view when management isn't visible and the employees are running the restaurant, not a good combination.  On a positive note...the food was great and prepared perfect! The other problems overshadowed that unfortunately. So I would say the kitchen staff is excellent, servers and host/hostess need a lot of improvement.     The whole area is has new construction, parking is tight and many restaurants are getting ready to open.  Ted's is an established restaurant around the country and hopefully with some experienced employees and management this location will improve. If not there are plenty of quality places getting ready to open right next door. Viva Chicken is one and they will eat \"Ted's lunch\" if there isn't an improvement. I would give this location some more time, their not ready."}
{"text":"Close to the Ted's in Marietta (East Cobb) and only open a week and a half  I'm always leary of visiting a newly opened restaurant within the first couple of weeks they are open because it's a learning experience even with trainers.  The East Cobb Ted's in Marietta is a favorite of mine and my son's family who lives in Marietta.  Last time we went, I played a trick on my wife. She was not feeling well so she stayed at the hotel and asked us to bring something back for her. Brought her back a great meatloaf which she enjoyed until I told her last night it was Bison. If looks could kill.  I was excited when I read last year that Ted's was coming to Charlotte. They opened a week ago last Wednesday.  Today we drove down from Cornelius to give them a try.  The Ted's in Marietta is nice but a bit dated while this one as you would expect is nice and fresh. Beautiful bar as you walk in and you are immediately at the hostess station. We were seated immediately in a booth on the edge of the main dining area. Nice dark woods and muted colors that work well together,  Our server was there immediately with menu's and to take our drink orders. She is good for the store in up selling because I had not thought about an appetizer till she mentioned it. Went for a cup of the Bison Chili and it was great. The slices of jalapeno made for a nice contrast in both taste and texture  The Bison Chili is reason enough to come here.  For my entree, I had a Knife and Fork Bison Chili Cheese Open Faced Sandwich with a 50/50 side of fries and onion rings.  Portions were very large and it's a delicious concept. Really enjoyed that one.  My wife and a Black and Blue Steak Salad which she really liked.She asked for the Sirloin Steak to be cooked medium and it was exactly that. Again large portions.  Can't believe how well this place is run after such a short time in business. I've know a number of very good restaurant today that did not get their feet on the ground for several months after they opened.  Definitely a keeper and it was worth the drive down from Cornelius. We will be back."}
{"text":"They are clearly still working the kinks out in this location. Service was super friendly and very apologetic for: 1. The wait (eventhough we had a reservation, we waited for an additional 15 minutes) and  2. For items that they ran out of (no buffallo chili, which meant no nachos, no mashed potatoes and they ran out of one of the desserts). 3. The wait for cocktails was very long too. This seemed odd, given that it was a Tuesday night. Let me mention it again: the service was excellent! That is why I am giving this place a three-star review. It should really only receive two stars, because I would not go back for the food, not at those prices."}
{"text":"I like this place. So keep that in mind when reading this review. I had an issue last night that I think would be beneficial to pass on to you all.   When ordering I was choosing between two options, the $15 fish sandwich and the $28 New York Strip Steak (Beef). In order to help make my decision I asked the waiter if the steak was Prime? He stated that he didn't know and would ask the chef. He came back and said it was so I ordered it. It wasn't Prime.   Now at $28 I wasn't convinced it was Prime before I ate it because a Prime New York Strip Steak at the Costco will run $18. Still, it was disappointing to be told it was Prime and then it not be Prime. When I told the waiter that it wasn't Prime - it's obvious - he said I could take it back and get something else. No need because it was still a good steak.   So just know you can't get a Prime steak at Ted's for $28 (you probably already knew that - haha).   The rest of the meal was great! Except for the cold fries."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in our first dining experience. We checked in with the host and gave the number in our party and he told us the wait time time (45 minutes), but he didn't take our name. My husband went back to the host stand and redid the check in, this time with our name, but we NEVER got called. Fortunately, two places at the bar opened up so we ate there. We ordered bison, but got charged for beef! The bartender even went through the cooking temps for the bison and the server said it was bison. We went there specially for bison, but thinking we got beef instead! Whichever we ate, it was a tad overcooked. On a postive note, the bar staff was great! Not sure if we will give them a second chance?  I noticed that their sanitary rating is only 90."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here. The service was great, the staff was very attentive to my son (acknowledged him, engaged in conversation with him). Matthew was our server and he did such a great job. The food was also very good, great presentation, delicious and flavorful. Very fresh. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Let's start with the service. We sat at the bar front and center and it took over 15 minutes for the bartender to take our order.   This is after we moved because we couldn't get their attention.    Now for the food. Ordered the $17 Bison burger. It was  lukewarm.  My husbands chicken was dry.    Not what I was expecting. Won't go back. Plenty of other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, spittoon on the top of the bar back next to an antique cash register! Who puts a spittoon on the counter top? Dishwasher station is apparently on the same wall as some of the booths. Be sure to bring a pen to sign your tab, both the bartender and waitress didn't have one. \"Dessert? \" No thanks, we'll walk over to \"The Porter's House\""}
{"text":"We had dinner there for the 2nd time last night. First time it was good, not so much this time. Chicken salad had hardly any chicken in it. The meatloaf sandwich and the squash casserole was so peppery you couldn't even eat it. What a waist of money. I will not be back."}
{"text":"So we did not have reservations (which I highly recommend!) but we managed to get a table! Our server was Sylvia and she was very helpful as we were newbies and was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions.  The menu has pretty good choices.  Entree choices are bison, angus beef, plank salmon, or chicken (grilled or fried).  Our adorable server brought us pickled cucumbers and promptly took our drink orders.  I love that they use only paper and not plastic straws!  After giving our order we had a chance to look around. Lots of wood decor and the table part was old maps...very cool idea!  My husband got the chowder which was delicious with lots clam!  He also got the #11 bison burger...yummy with lots of horseradish!  I ordered the skinny,burger with no bun, which came with avocado, tomatoes and lettuce, and an amazing kale salad. BE WARNED...if you order your burger medium then you get it rare!!! I sent mine back to be cooked a bit more.  Gave 4 instead of 5 stars because it came back still undercooked!  The flavor Was very delicious though!  My mother in law got the bacon cheese bison burger and I tasted it....next time I'm getting that!!! Slab of cheddar, lots of bacon and grilled onion! Very tasty and juicy! The side of fries were crunchy and delicious.  This is not meant to be a shorts and flip flop type restaurant but a dressy casual place.  The bar looks great and we will be sure to take advantage of that next time!!! Yeah...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was subpar.  Had to go to the bar to get a drink while seated at a table for almost 15 minutes.  Waiter was a bit arrogant.  Salmon was good, but a bit too smoky for me.  Asparagus was not snapped so had the ends that should have never seen a plate!  Rolls are not ver good.  Baked potato wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese or butter.  Complained and they offered a dessert . . For 5 people!  They raced about the strawberry shortcake.  Biscuits on it were like rocks and all you tasted was baking soda.  Complained to the waiter and he walked away.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"The Bison burger was really good!  I didn't know very much about Bison, but our waiter was very informative and very patient with us with all of our questions.  We enjoyed our dinner on their outdoor patio.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I tried this place the opening day, and I will be back probably every single week. Wow BISON BURGER! Who would've thought bison was better tasting than cow. Well it was! I loved it! The staff was so nice! And went above average to accommodate my table of 5. They have great priced appetizers. The bison and other entrees a bit more expensive than the average Applebees or Chilis but you get what you pay for. A delicious burger! My friend Christian swears by the pot roast. I tried it, and it did not disappoint one bit. Teds Montana Grill is exactly what the city of Charlotte needed. Hoping they open another restaurant in the uptown area. If so I may just grab a weekend shift! Jk!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. The service was terrible!  Was told we would be seated in 5 minutes and over 30 minutes later had to go ask.  Seems they \"forgot\".   Waiter never came back to check on us or refill waters and even sent someone else to deliver our check.  SANITATION RATING is 90.5 which is too low.  Had I seen this before, would not have stayed! Don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Let me start with what was good - my daughter had the chicken and loved it. The burgers were flavorful however I am not sure why they ask you how you want it cooked because everyone's was well done. The onion rings were hot and tasty but the fries were cold. Here we start to go down hill - our waiter was obviously new and not well trained. I blame the management team here. The food took 35 minutes to arrive. One order was wrong. In the meantime we all ran out of drinks. The mojito was made with water and Splenda - we sent it back. We sat around tables that stayed dirty and watched the bus person walk by them several times. No management to be seen anywhere. I can understand why the restaurant was almost empty on a Sunday at 12:30. The line was out the door at VIVA Chicken. I wish we would stood in it. We want be back"}
{"text":"Third time tonight at Teds and this is now one of our go to destinations.  Excellent friendly service in an upscale atmosphere.  Bison burgers have great flavor and always prepared correctly.  Portions are perfect for even the hungriest.  Great options for sides including monster onion rings and some pretty tasty carrots.  Bar area is great spot to avoid the wait times.  The only drawback is the $$$.  Burgers are a little speedy at about $16.  Otherwise, awesome place for families. Couples and even the occasional crew team looking for a great meal after a race.  Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"This is going to be one the most difficult reviews that I need to give: Food was good ordered  a bison burger with horseradish cheese and fries  Ordered medium rare got medium well fries needed seasoning but all tasted good My barmaid Megan when I arrived seemed to be having trouble entering someone's order on the computer  Then everyone but me as soon as they sat down received a small dish of pickles.and  after my meal I asked her about that and she then offered me some  Said didn't know I wanted some??? Also when I told her burger tasted ok but not cooked correctly she said she will tell ( who I don't know because she didn't say who) Nothing happen  There were two guys in suite jacket that were by the desk when you come in and they were just mostly in the way of the hostess and never spoke to anyone who were sitting at bar or tables They both should be replaced not good mangers Also the entrance to restaurant in on the opposite side of parking lot So after you park in the parking lot you have to walk around whole building up some steps to get into restaurant  Seems to me you would want to make it easy for your customers to get into restaurant  Entrance should on parking lot side there is one there but they direct you around building  Makes no sense If Jordan Wilson was one of the managers on duty Saturday 7/15/17 @ 12-400PM he needs to be trained much better  Not sure if I would go back"}
{"text":"Very underwhelming experience. Came during lunch and they weren't busy at all. It took 10 minutes for our waiter to show up and another 10 minutes to bring our water. Then one dish comes out but not the other one. The single dish we got was made wrong. The 2nd dish came out 5 min later and it was also wrong. Very expensive for very bad service and bad tasting food. Also took us over an hour to get out of there because our waiter just kept disappearing. Never again."}
{"text":"Ted Turner is in the bison farming business and what a good way to, in part, further profiting by opening your restaurant chain that serves, you guessed it,  bison.  I wish that at least for this location they focused more on timely food service.   Seriously,  we were sat at 630p per our reservation but didn't get the meals till 830p.  Disappointing.   Plus we were celebrating my wifes birthday and hoping for a great time with family and friends, and  it just compounded the frustration I felt.  But, we still had a great time with our friends to whom I owe the 5 stars versus Teds.  The ambiance of this location is great (5/5) and being a new store it was contemporary in design and the seating was laid out nicely.  Albeit the interior was smaller than I imagined it would be.  And the entrance does seem to be oddly located as noted in another review.  Our server did an overall good job (4/5) and apologetic when advising us the kitchen was just backed up, although the restaurant didn't seem that crazy from a volume perspective. The food was good (4/5) but many felt it wasn't quite worth the wait or wasn't to the quality that the restaurant claimed to offer. But no felt it was a three star though.  I think the poor kitchen service time impacted the tastebuds for some. Our server did offer some free chips which was nice though. And he did a good job in bringing out the birthday cake cut and ready to serve with a single candle. My wife was overall happy and given we were there 3 hours that's all I can ask for."}
{"text":"We loved the one in Durham when we lived out that way. This one has been open a few months and the service is really hit or miss and the prices seem higher across the board.  Food has been good, but not great. Service really has room for improvement. Based on past experience at the Durham location I'm hopeful this will turn into a great place to eat."}
{"text":"They say that the second time is the charm, but not in this case.  When I first went here, everything was in order.  Today the service was very slow.  We both ordered the Farmhouse salad with chicken.   My lunch companion's salad had no chicken.   Tons of greens and really a good salad, but they were $14 each.  The total bill with gratuity was over $40.  That is just too much for lunch, but I realize that we were paying for the atmosphere too.  The problem is that we were seated at the last booth in the back and were next to stock brokers who brought some potential clients to lunch.  All we heard was portfolio related conversation.   I just wanted a quiet space and good service and good food.   I got one out of three!"}
{"text":"If you're new to bison, ask for a sample. It sealed the deal for me to order the skinny dip bison burger (bunless) w avocado. The flavor was excellent although it was a little hard to eat without the bun. Kale salad was delish. The decor was a little upscale but there was a kids birthday party at the table next to us and we were in very casual clothes. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"NOT what I expected from The Ted?   Slow Tuesday night single thought I'd eat at a bar table top.   15 min later not even a \"shit howdy\" from a single staff member?   Ted, you need to grab this one by the horns before it gets away..."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I have formed this opinion now because for any years I enjoyed eating at various TMG's in my business travel. I know what the baseline standard is.  In fairness this is a new location. But not so new that more improvement should be obvious by now. If I'm paying $15.00 for a burger, my expectation would be to deliver it cooked medium as ordered. In four visits to this location it has always been overcooked. On my last visit, four of us ordered burgers. Most were not cooked properly. The only request for medium well was the closet to medium requested by two others whose burgers were well done. My kale salad was noticeably old, tasted sour, and had an offensive odor. I mentioned it to our server  towards the end of the meal and felt like he could care less.  If he passed it on, no manager or representative followed up. As much as I have liked the menu and restaurant theme at TMG,  this location is currently on my \"Do not go to list.\""}
{"text":"Consistently poor service. As in, the food comes out super slow and at the wrong times. Long wait for drinks (non-alcoholic), condiments after dinner is over, biscuits and salad at the end of a meal, one person gets entree but the other doesn't. The staff seems nice enough, although uneducated about the basics of the menu when asked simple questions. Perhaps because it's still relatively new they are still getting the kinks out. Today on the way out we noticed the rating was a 90. Not terribly low, but lower than the restaurants we normally frequent and quite honestly it took us by surprise considering this is a somewhat upscale place. I do wonder what the violations are, of course they could be nothing to be alarmed about all. I will say, even though the service or timing of the kitchen needs work, THE FOOD HERE IS GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Ted's just isn't Teds anymore.  After having been to the home restaurant in Columbus OH, things have really gone downhill.    The prices at Ted's were always absurd for the food and the environment but the portion sizes and food quality have gone downhill.  Some of the best menu items are gone.    If you want to pay $30 a steak and get an Applebees environment and a slightly better steak, the drinks and appetizers are good."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Always great service and the bison is sooooooo good. I usually get the teds filet steak but everything I've had is good here. One of the best restaurants to eat around here. Friendly, professional service."}
{"text":"We dined at Ted's before they were officially opened for one their training nights. Our experience was fabulous. The service was great & so was the food. The server was thorough in his explanation on Why Bison over beef and emphasized the farm to table concept. It was fun to try something new & we loved all of the eco-friendly touches. The handmade drinks were delicious too. Our family will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We met our friends at noon on Sunday when it was pretty empty at Ted's Montana Grill.  I have to agree with other reviews that the entrance is in an odd place, but nothing you can do about that now!  We were seated in a booth which had an odd atmosphere to it because the lighting in the booth made it feel like night time when it was sunny outside!  Where did the sun go?   Our server was very pleasant and patient with our friends coming a bit later and taking some time to check out the menu.  It was our friends second time coming but our first.  We were given the little bowl of pickles...nice change but super salty and our one friend hated them.  Bread is a bit more universal!  And it wasn't a great portion for 4 people.    Our friends were pretty pleased with their meals, one being the trout and the other the meatloaf sandwich.  Not thrilled with the tomato sides though.  They said the first time they had eaten there, they were seasonal, delicious red tomatoes which made us all order them but this time around they were those dull pink hot house tasteless tomatoes.  Uck...give me those in winter, not prime tomato season!  Hubby and I got bison burgers, medium rare.  Both came out well done and SUPER salty, but our server had disappeared and our friends had dug into their meals.  I ate half of mine and left the rest...oh boy and those three slices of tomato.  What a weak looking plate.  If the server had come back to check on our burgers I would have sent both of ours back but she only came back to bring take-out containers and give us the check.  The straws were made of recycled materials that felt really weird when you used them and my friends had to explain what they were and told us that Ted's recycles as much as they can.  BRAVO on that!  But how about having your server tell us about it?  Especially when I asked where the straws were and she had to point them out.  A nice well-dressed young man kept walking by and smiling over at us so I figured he might be a manager?  Wish he had stopped by!  So, trout, meatloaf, two burgers and two soda's (no apps) cost $90.  I'd rather try somewhere else next time we go out."}
{"text":"As much as I would love to be able to write a glowing review, I'm afraid I can't. Unfortunate thing is that I cannot even rate the food. My husband and I went in on Memorial Day for a late lunch - around 2:30. The hostess greeted us and quickly seated us in the dining room. We noticed the dining room was quite full, especially considering the time of day. As we sat and sat waiting on someone, anyone, to acknowledge us, we started noticing patrons with empty drink glasses, empty booths with uncleared tables, etc. after about 15-20!minutes without anyone acknowledging that we were at their table, we decided we needed to leave and grab lunch somewhere else. We proceeded to get up, walk out right by the hostess who had seated us, yet did not even say thank you for coming. Not sure what the restaurant's issues were that day, but not the way you should be running a newly opened place. We had hoped this would be a great neighborhood spot for us, but not so sure now. I'll have to think long and hard before giving them a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio, lots of foot traffic walking by but quiet enough to hear guests at your table. The prices are sky high and service is great but I think I wanted more. My steak wasn't flavorful enough. I had the Delmonico and for the price I wanted to be in love but it was dry and bland. My husband wasn't impressed either. We ordered veggies and they were gross. Too expensive to be mediocre. This is a one and done for us."}
{"text":"It's a chain - yes, but a consistent and well-run one...which means it will likely clean up here in a suburban strip mall in suburban Charlotte. The location, layout and footprint are terrible - as noted in prior reviews. But, the host and wait staff are exceedingly polite, and both the interior and patio set a relaxed tone.    The Ted's in Indianapolis was a favorite of our family of four in the early 2000s, and we were anxious to see how the concept and food stood up now - after we became  jaded from two years in San Francisco.  Turns out we still really like Ted's. The pickled cucumbers (which are not completely either of these two words, but exponentially better than both) served as a starter remain wonderful, the burgers (particularly bison) are outstanding, and the salmon and chicken are nothing to sneeze at. The bison meatloaf is amazing - if you're considering it you should order it."}
{"text":"Service was not great- all of our sides were cold. The top half of my bun was dry and crumbly, the bottom half was soaked through. Food was mediocre at best for the price we paid. Our waitress was friendly- that was the best part of our experience!"}
{"text":"We get there and it's a 45 min wait ... ok well we didn't have a res on a Sat. night. We sit at the bar that is also was full but greeted and severed by Anthony. He was quick and efficient. We order a round of drinks and the chips with dip and play a round of cards to pass the time.      At an hour and 5 we start asking where we stand. A few more no worries... we waited this long. I did have a child who was finally over the flu and happy to be out and eat a burger after a week of soup, and he's getting tired. After a hour and a half we finally get sat. The manager on the floor took care of our tab because of the double amount of wait time for the table. That was unexpected and appreciated.      We have the dinner and the server Kaylee was prompt and courteous. We ordered an app and 3 dinners-- and the food was served in good time, hot, and AMAZING! My sons burger was overcooked to well (we asked med) and they took care of that as well. But my short rib was delicious       At first we had a bad taste in our mouth about the place, but the manager opted to make things more bearable for the wait without us even asking! That's some good management who cares about his customers! We will return as the place is beautiful, the staff is prompt and efficient, and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"The food was good but service was below standard. Waited 30 minutes for table then another 30 before we ordered.....then waited 30 minutes for food. Doubt this will be a repeat place to go but try it if you have time & not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Alright first Chu's Mexican food  sucks and now this Ted Montana sucks what a beautiful shopping center and you got two restaurants that  suck don't waste your time and money to this place the food is horrible service is all rookies 27 different waiters  to my table horrible horrible I'll never go back I do not recommend this place if you got the extra coin and you want a great steak go to the porterhouse that is an awesome place"}
{"text":"Ted's is in the new Waverly shopping center, which can be both good and bad. At the moment, it is bad because there is construction absolutely everywhere, and they are located in the most construction-y portion of the place. Seriously. Sit on the porch (?) and you are looking at the apartments/condos/whatever, rather than something scenic, like a nice river, or maybe Providence Road. Okay, it really isn't going to get a whole lot better, even when the construction work is done, but at least it will be a bit nicer.  To make matters a bit worse, the entrance to Ted's is in about the worse location possible - around the back of the building. Whoever designed this building is just a moron. Okay, not an actual moron, of course, just someone who probably has perhaps never seen the site in person. To their credit, there is a valet in what should be the \"front\", which is next to another scenic location (what appears to be an enclosed dumpster). Whether you choose to valet, or self park, you then walk around the corner, only to find - you need to walk around another corner, only to find - you walk around another corner. And you see the outdoor area, which is in a corridor-like area , with a view of little to nothing, other than the construction mentioned earlier.  Now that you have found the entrance, the staff greets you, and they are very nice. It is not their fault that the building is laid out the way it is. And beyond the layout, the building itself is actually quite nice, it just needs to be oriented a different way. Or perhaps once the construction is complete, it will make more sense, but since there is a fence where said construction is happening, the only way in is the long way around, which makes no sense at all.  A word of warning: The place is busy, even during off-hours (a weekend afternoon, for instance). We chose to sit at the bar. This was good because we did not have a long wait to be seated. This was bad because the bar is busy, serving people sitting there (like us) and others who want their drinks. It is also a place you get to see how they are not quite ready for service - like leaving large buckets of lemonade on the bar to block wait staff from picking up their drink orders. They will surely work it out.  The good news is that, as mentioned, the staff is friendly. And the bison is excellent. Many times, even places that should be used to serving bison cooked it like an old shoe. At Ted's they do it very well. If it was just about the meat, then they would be off the charts amazing but unfortunately it is not. At least not yet. Maybe soon."}
{"text":"Delmonico Bison was great! A new customer and fan was created yesterday after experiencing this entree."}
{"text":"Made our 1st visit to Ted's Saturday night and had a sub-par experience.   Waitress was nice and friendly at 1st and helped us order our food. We shared an appetizer to start and it tasted like it had been made earlier and shelved for awhile.  About 3 bites in, our mains arrived. I hate that.  We finished the app and then started on our cooling mains. Pot roast was average, recommended mash potatoes were bland, but the bison burger was really tasty.  About half way through the mains the waitress asked if we would like to see a dessert menu and I just stared at her in disbelief.  Realizing she was just trying to turn over our table I said no thanks and she said she'd be right back with the check.  We paid and left, leaving our half eaten meals behind.  We won't rush back here..."}
{"text":"I felt like I was at McDonalds. There were kids everywhere but dinner for 4 still cost me $150 buck. They just need an outside gym & they will be all set."}
{"text":"Nice place in crowded Waverly shopping/apartment area off Providence. Lots of parking but lots of cars to go in those spots!  Food is so so -I had the salmon and the rest had steaks and burgers nothing outstanding. However, the mashed potato side was a do over.   The service was horrible. Took forever to get our food then the check was another 15 min wait. This was a business dinner and  people had been traveling all day and wanted to get to the hotel,  so the delays were unfortunate. I have been to others before but this location needs work."}
{"text":"If you want bad service and cold food , it's the place for you, we had to order our drinks at the bar three times, there were only one other couple at the bar, nachos came out cold, what made it weird was the chef came out and stared us down, okweird, the second batch was also cooled , good job chef, stay in the kitchen and make sure the product comes out at the right temp, we toke a couple bites and pushed it away and the bar tender said we must of liked them, are you kidding me, how would pay for a 18.00 burger, that looks like something worst than I hop, second chance no"}
{"text":"Tried for call ahead seating tonight. Was told table would ready in 45 min. Got there 30 min later and still had to wait another hour and 15 min. Host seemed totally lost when I would check in on my table. Finally got seated. Food was pretty good I must say. Def not worth almost a two hour wait however. If in the area I would recommend Mickey and mooch instead."}
{"text":"Nancy and I dined there last evening and thought we were going to enjoy something new. Nancy had a nice burger and onion rings. We had great pickled cucumbers. My burger was awful-- dry was over cooked fries were just warm. I mentioned to the server and it was basically brushed off saying I'm sorry. On the way out I noticed the health score hidden behind the entrance door and obscured by a plant 90.5. That told me a lot. I'll wait until they get settled before visiting again. Bill including wine and beer was $56"}
{"text":"I had high expectations, but so disappointed. Granted, it was takeout, but for $60.00 for three burgers, I expected more. Traffic and parking- minus 0 stars. Finding entrance 0 stars, and many others were looking. I have difficulty walking, so was not happy. The burgers were mediocre at best for the price. No thanks."}
{"text":"Great all round experience. Had the best welcome ever.  Youngest was \"having a moment\" as we were walking through the door.  Greeter instantly spoke to her and asked if she's like a lemonade and difused the aituation immediately with a simple smile and kindness.  Food was delicious. Server was great.  All round terrific experience."}
{"text":"Didn't like the food at all, over priced . I was expecting to be blow away and I was, on how poor the food was. If you going to spend money don't spend it here. Super disappointed. I gave it two stars for the service and speed."}
{"text":"Friends wanted to try out Ted's this past Saturday.  I saw that it was onl;y 3 star rated and prices seemed a little inflated but they wanted to go.  We had 8:30 reservations and they were NOT that busy for Saturday 8:30 pm.  There were a handful of empty tables around and I didn't get to see too much of the main area because we wanted to sit outside.    Our waitress was friendly right from the start. We order drinks and I'm told that they were out of mint, so I could not get a mojito.  I asked for the cocktail with bourbon and lemonade but could they tone down the sweetness by using 50/50 water/lemonade.  I really appreciated that she didn't give me a strange look but agreed right away.  That right there gets a very big thank you to her because I do like a little sweetness to my drinks but not overly so.  One friend ordered a beef burger, the other ordered a rare filet and I ordered the skinny dip which is a burger (turkey for me and added pepper jack to it) no bun, tomato, avocado and kale salad on the side.  Our food took close to an hour to come out.  I noticed the table next to us had a similar wait time.  Not sure if everyone had come in at the same time but remember I said that there were empty tables around.  Right before the food arrived, a waiter stopped by to say that they were out of baked potatoes and mashed potatoes (REALLY??) but they ere making some broccoli right away, did she want that or something else in the place of the potato she ordered.  She requested the salad and it was not even 2 minutes before our meals were brought out, it was that fast after that.  I noticed immediately that the avocado was missing from my plate and our waitress was apologetic and grabbed it right away.  My friends seemed happy with their food and I will say that the kale salad was fantastic.  I really enjoyed the dressing.  My turkey burger was EXTREMELY salty though.  If I had been by myself, I would have sent it back.  Monday I was still feeling dehydrated because of how salty it was.  Our cocktails were good as was our waitress. I just was not impressed that they were out of so many items, that we waited so long for our food when there were a number of empty tables and that my burger was ridiculously salty. If my friends are set on going back there again, I will go but would just stick with the kale salad and skip the turkey burgr.  Too bad because I loved the idea of the Skinny dip and finally a healthy option on a menu."}
{"text":"I come here because they offer a great burger for under $12 include a side of nice size sweet potato with Cinnamon delicious with pickles as appetizers. The bonus is lean Bison 1/3 of fat as beef. But knock lacking in taste. The atmosphere is bit old school dark panel men's club. Service is good. The deserts are worth the splurge.  They offer NY Strip, Ribeye and Bison well priced won't break the bang. Get a booth for a romantic dinner. It will not disappoint. 4.5 stars highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this restaurant & it was a solid experience. Our server was great - kind and attentive. Our food came out fairly quickly and was as expected. This is a good family-friendly option (we have twin 5-year olds) that is just slightly upscale enough to feel as if you're out at an 'adult' restaurant, but is still kid friendly & reasonably priced. We will be back."}
{"text":"I recently visited Ted's in Denver and loved it so, I wanted to try this one, near my home. Myself, wife and daughter  went on a Sunday evening around 6:30pm. The place was super busy with lots of screaming kids. The service was desperately running. It was obvious they were understaffed. It took a long time to get our drinks from the bar on the first round and when our glasses were empty, I figured it would be faster to go to the bar and bring the drinks back to the table. The bartender was overwhelmed as well. He was trying to draw a beer and open a bottle of wine at the same time.    Anyway, after I brought the drinks back to the table, our food arrived after a short wait and my Canyon Creek burger (though not medium as requested) was really good.  The fries and fish sandwich were great and my wife's naked Bison Burger was very good too.   Overall, I would say our experience was a little stressful. Very good food.  Slow service.  High noise.   We agreed we would return but considering the parking challenges of Waverly, the busyness of the place, the noise level and overwhelmed staff, it will be a while before we will want to try again.   I'm not sure if management can't find staff to handle the volume or this is SOP but hope they get some help."}
{"text":"Not sure why the 3 star overall review here. I've been here three times and they have all been pretty good. The service and food are what you would think for this type of restaurant. I've had a salad with grilled chicken, bison sliders and a beef filet mignon. All were good...the filet mignon wasn't the best I've had but none the less still ok.   I have to say, their onion rings are really good. I don't eat fried foods but the smell and crispy allure sucked me in.   The burgers are a big portion so be ready to eat if ordering one. I've only done lunches so i didn't partake in the cocktails but i did walk around to check out the bar and it looks like they can dish out something good."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to stop in here and sit at the bar, have a drink and some food.  Great place, all the bartenders and staff are always super friendly and we get really good service.  Love the wedge salad, on Sunday the Turkey Diner is awesome.  Really good burgers.  The homemade chips and dip is great with a couple of cold beers after work.    Have seen some folks say that it's too expensive but it's right in line with all the places down in this area so if you haven't tried it I would suggest you give it a shot."}
{"text":"Even with making a reservation and at a slower time the service was poor. There were empty tables and yet it wad over 10 min b4 someone even came over. Then we were ready to order but the waiter said he was not ready and could only do drinks. Then there was a constant list to excuses  from i got a few big parties to only one bar tender. Then the food came and no follow up on how it was parpared or refresh on drinks. Treated better at fast food restaurant"}
{"text":"Ignore the negative reviews. Great food and service. Had a bison burger and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Excited new places are opening up in South Charlotte, but do not waste your time at this place!!!  To start out, we have never had bison before and the waitress encouraged us to try the bison burger. So my mom and sister order the burger and I ordered the Farmhouse salad. When the food came out, my order and my sisters order were wrong. My sister asked for no bun and to have the side salad brought out with the order (her burger had the bun and her salad came out immediately after we ordered) and my salad didn't have the \"roasted chicken\".   I asked the waitress about the chicken and she said she would bring some right out. When they brought the side of chicken, it was about 7 pieces of the driest chicken ever and it seemed to be fried and not roasted. So bad!  My mom didn't prefer the bison burger and the waitress said she could get something else. So she ordered a side salad, which was okay. When the bill came, they charged us for everything and we asked to have one of the bison burgers that we didn't like to be removed and the manager came out to speak to us. Let's just say she was extremely rude and not apologetic at all.   Terrible food for the price... end of story. #stillhungry  P.S. at least the bottle of wine we ordered was good :)"}
{"text":"This is a Fantastic restaurant and bar. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. Choose from Bison or Beef, you can't go wrong with either. The Vibe here is Hip & Cool, a great neighborhood hangout. We really Loved the bar as well, the drinks are Creative and Scrumptious."}
{"text":"Horrible. Won't even go into how our steaks were cooked completely wrong dry with no flavor. All I will say is we ordered a bottle of wine that required the bartender to get on a ladder then step on the bar with her shoes in order to retrieve it. Saw this hapoen 4 times and didn't even attempt cleaning where she stepped on the bar...nasty!!! Avoid at all cost!!"}
{"text":"A lot of the reviews complain on wait time, we went on a Saturday at 3 and there were very few other tables there. The wait time on the food was a bit long, but he food itself was excellent. We got the nachos and we're offered extra chili as we ran low on topping. We also got a bison burger with squash casserole and it was fantastic. Def will return, but will avoid high traffic times for sure."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time coming here.  Our first visit (anniversary dinner) was mediocre at best.  Our 2nd visit (graduation celebration lunch) was just terrible. We waited forever for our drinks and then again for our food.  When the food came out, 4 out of 7 of our meals were cold (when intended to be hot burgers).  While they offered us free dessert for the poor experience, it was not enough to have us go back.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"They have really declined. First couple of visits the reservation was right, staff was good and food was cooked as ordered. Last two times, totally disorganized, all food was over cooked, long waits for everything and no apology when questioned. Take a pass until they figure it out if they ever do."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would!  Had to wait at bar for about 10 minutes ... got seated and after 2-3 minutes of no service I started the timer on my phone ... at almost 11 minutes myself and my daughter decided to leave.  Then I talked to manager ... no real apology or let me get right on that ... just where were you sitting?  How that was important I'll never know!  DEPLORABLE!!!!! Shame shame shame on a restaurant that charges premium prices and can't even manage to get us a glass of water!!! Lost a customer for life and will never go back!"}
{"text":"I took my 2 teen sons there for lunch to celebrate last day of school. We sat outside and ordered burgers. It took about 45 minutes to get our food- at LUNCH and it wasn't that busy. Our server never even said anything until I asked her. A manager came out to apologize and even after that it took about 10 more minutes(how long it should have taken in the first place) Then 2 of our 3 orders were wrong. My son ordered no cheese and his had cheese. I ordered bison burger medium rare and it was well done. The manager said he was taking care of our entire meal and then our server brought us a check for 3 iced teas. Seriously. It was awful."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great... yet.  Seems a bit disorganized.  Confusion being seated, food Luke warm and a bit bland.   Atmosphere is great, menu/selections are great just needs better attention to detail. I would pass on the squash casserole.. no taste and dry.  Adding Brussels sprouts to menu would be a plus."}
{"text":"Tried them for second time last night and have to say I was under whelmed again. South Charlotte seems to have a a problem getting qualified experienced restaurant help. Ordered at the bar which was not busy at all. I got a bison burger medium rare.  It arrived medium well, the ciabatta was stale and the onion straws and fries were cold. Food was delivered but not one person including bar manager stopped over to see if everything was ok and if we needed anything like maybe silverware. At $17 for a burger I expect it to be great. Bar staff busy stocking bar etc... but could careless about us. Manager did replace burger But roll still stale straws still cold. Won't be going back."}
