{"text":"Good food at a good price. I came here for breakfast but thinking that I should really come here for lunch. For breakfast I had a grilled cheese with ham as well as well as a chocolate muffin. Everything tasted good and the price with taxes was 5.21 which is good for the area.
I'll be going back for lunch because their sandwich looked really good. The eggs sandwich looked big and the price was low."}
{"text":"I was going to Jeans Jeans Jeans but it moved moved moved, and found this awesome cafe in the middle of the warehouse district, which I guess the name derives from. Thinking to take advantage of the sun left in September I had a cold drink and some sort of cakey donut with bavarian cream in it on the outdoor patio. It was good but what was even better is that this place reminded me of Williamsburg in the heart of the warehouse district and the vibe was a bit of Brooklyn-ite as well, people working, people making art, people drinking coffee and making art and not working. One of the best things was a piano that was put across the street, it was in tune, I didn't know that Montreal had so many piano players in it before today."}
{"text":"I like the paninis here and the soups and the desserts I have tried so far.. But what takes the cake with this place is their customer service. I didn't know that they don't take credit cards or non-Canadian debit cards and was a couple bucks short and the lady manning the cash  register let me have my food and said not to worry about it.... needless to say I will be paying my dues back but I liked this nature that you don't get to see a lot... so shout out to that lady...."}
{"text":"I was walking and noticed this cafe shop in the distance.  It was cold out and a few other places hadn't opened yet so I stopped in to get a bite to eat. The place is similar to a Starbucks. The had a handwritten menu of items they sold such as meaty sandwiches, grilled cheese, muffins, coffee,  latte's etc. I ordered a latte and asked if they had caramel  (Lol) the lady said no. The sandwiches looked good and fresh but they were pretty big. I asked the lady if they serve half sizes, she said no so I ordered a grilled cheese instead. My latte was made right in front of me and served hot. The grilled cheese was ready about 3min later and was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had! As others came in I noticed several customers ordered grilled cheese sandwiches also. If you're in the area check them out."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich and dessert if you are looking for a fast and light lunch.

I've tried several of their sandwiches and my favourite is the one with tuna."}
{"text":"I love this spot, everything they make is delicious and super well priced. The staff is very delightful. If you are in the area, I definitely recommend to check it out"}
{"text":"Had the greatest experience here. Had a delicious cappuccino and my boyfriend had a wonderful latte. Excellent customer service. 

We walked into the cafe and ordered our drinks. When it came time to pay we were told that they were closed and that our drinks were on them. So kind of them to make us drinks regardless. We were tourists in Montreal and it gave us the perfect start to our trip. We would def come back to this cafe!"}
