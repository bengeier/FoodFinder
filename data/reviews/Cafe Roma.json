{"text":"If you are after food court quality pizza than this is the place to go. They have other options outside of pizza which I don't have an opinion on as I only tries the pizza, but I can't imagine the quality to be much higher. Interior is hot and not very clean."}
{"text":"Nothing's special in here. You've got your pizza by the slice. Don't get anything with chicken here. Some funny part of the animal somehow always makes it in there. The bread roll is rubber like. I wouldn't say it is clean. Service is not that friendly."}
{"text":"I love this little place.  I think their pizza is yummy and the lady who owns it always makes me smile.  She always has a smile on her face and is genuinely nice every time I walk in."}
{"text":"I got the lasagna, but I think they did not hear it enough so it was still cold inside. But the taste was great."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of time and was satisfied.  However, the last time I went, I swear they downsized their food -- the pizza slice was smaller and the small salad was dinky (maybe two bites worth!).  The price stayed the same however.  I know we all have to pinch our pennies during these tough economic times, but making the food smaller and charging the same = not cool."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING...Go next door to have better food and better service.

I stopped by for a slice of pizza for a quick lunch. The pizza was only terrible. The seasoning was way too peppery and it tasted like it had been sitting out all day, even though it was only 11:30 a.m. It also was greasy and I actually had to dab it with a napkin to make it edible. When I did take a bite, it tasted like cardboard. It definitely was a disappointment. The server seemed rushed and she was very abrupt. She did not try to make a connection with her patrons at all. She was border-line rude and never thanked me. They were not busy at all.

I had been to the Downtown Phoenix location in the past and always enjoyed it. This location has a lot to be desired. Had the food been better for the $5 price, or had the service been nicer, I might have considered going back there. Don't waste your time and money.

Next time, I will skip Cafe Roma and patronize the great eateries next door: Ladybug Cafe, Filiberto's, Port of Subs, Haiku Grill, or Starbuck's."}
{"text":"In short, I love this place.  It is not fancy.  It is not somewhere you want to bring a date.  But the restaurant accomplishes exactly what it sets out to accomplish: make simply great food.  Very reasonable prices, too!

I love their pizza, their sandwiches, and their pasta.  And I love love love the bread that comes with the dinners.  I can't think of a better piece of bread I've ever tried.  (This seems an odd thing to gush over, but it really is great!)"}
{"text":"Perfect hand tossed crust, great service, fresh every time. What else do you need at a lunch place? Perfect!"}
{"text":"As one of the other reviews said, there were flies all over the pizza and the place wasn't clean at all.  The pizza was reheated and was barely warm when they gave it to me.  I've eaten NY style pizza and while the style was close, the pizza was a definite F.  My coworker had the calzone and said the sauce was good.  Definitely a disappointment looking for good thin crust pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the AZ center. Seriously, I LOVE it. I ate here almost everyday one summer, and I still enjoy their pizza and pastas. The salad pizza is a fave, because it is unique. Their daily specials are so yummy, they vary from chicken parm to chicken with feta and tomatoes. There is a new special everyday.  Call ahead if you are in a hurry, they will have your order ready when you get there."}
{"text":"Wow!  Wasn't expecting much from this place at all, but it ended up being a nice spot to visit for lunch.  The cheese pizza was quite tasty.  The crust was very crispy, but the top of the pizza was still chewy.  At $2.25 a slice, this is a great deal!!

The restaurant itself is very, very casual.  It's more of a stop in for lunch kind of place than a sit down for dinner kind of place.  If ya know what I mean..."}
{"text":"This pizza is gross. I've had school cafeteria pizza better than this. Super thin and excessively soggy, lacking sauce and tasted like broiler grease more than anything else. I had it twice on different days and there was hardly any difference between visits.  Absolutely nasty."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the Arizona Center. I've been coming here off and on for years, and this weekend I tried one of their sandwiches for the first time -- the meatball parmigiana. It was delicious, and I'm not even a meatball sub kind of dude. The bread is fresh-baked in house, and it had a really nice crusty-chewy combination. I could have just sat there and munched on the bread all by itself and been happy. The combo of meatballs, tomato sauce, and mozzarella worked very well.

The pizza, which I've only had by the slice, is probably a 7 on a scale of 1-10. It's better than most, and the crust has that same nice chewy texture. Their pizza is massively better than the place that occupied the same spot a few years ago. I imagine a fresh-ordered whole pizza would be even better than the slices I've had.

Finally, try the baked ziti. She always has it during lunch. I love it. I don't know anything about ziti, so I can't offer a detailed analysis here -- it's just always a reliable choice for me."}
{"text":"1st trip: Tried the appetizer sampler, which wasn't anything to write home about.  But it's OK, it was just an appetizer sampler, we weren't expecting anything spectacular.  What was really awful was the service.  As we walked in we couldn't find anyone, except someone watching TV.  So we waited there for a minute or two and finally sat ourselves.  Turns out the our waiter was the guy watching TV.  Throughout the whole evening the guy maybe visited us maybe 4 times, we couldn't even get him to take our money (still glued to the TV) so we left cash and walked out.

2nd trip:  We decided to give the place a second chance because for some reason we thought the place was under new management.  Service similarly bad, waiter checked in on us more often but it still took a really long time just for the guy to run my credit card (no cash on me this time).  We had two waiters, first one messed up our orders several times on simple things like drinks--which they fixed.  The worst aspect of this evening was the food, the pizza we ordered tasted like a frozen Digiorno pizza, and not the fancy kind that taste good.  I left the restaurant convinced that the place is a cover for some sort of illicit activity.

Just to make things clear: I hate giving 1 star reviews.  I'm a local and I like supporting local businesses, and there are a LOT of good restaurants in this area.  This is not one of them.  Not even remotely."}
{"text":"I suggest paying very close attention to the prices. I went there 8/14/2011 and ordered a stromboli and small drink, when they rang it up he rang up $1 something twice and then $8.50 for the stromboli bringing the total on the register to $12 and some change. When I pointed out that the menu board said that the stromboli is only $7.50 he huffed and said \"fine I'll just make it smaller\" at that point I turned and wallked out.

Being only a block from ASU student dorms I wouldn't be surprised if preoccupied students aren't being cheated on a regular basis there."}
{"text":"we just went in for a quick slice and a beer. service was good. very cozy place. decent pizza. we got a slice of pepperoni and a shock top. not bad for the price."}
{"text":"The guy overcharged my sister for sure! Pizza was mediocre, I'm from NY and I know what good pizza tastes like."}
{"text":"Weaksauce.

The pizza was mediocre and had obviously been sitting awhile.  Two slices of pepperoni pie and a medium pop set me back nearly $10.  For that price I expect more.  Nothing special or notable about the pizza.  It's not horrible if you're strolling thru Arizona Center but don't go expecting much.  If you've devoured pie in NYC, skip it all together."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab lunch when I'm at work. I love their ziti but the pizza is always a great choice too. The people in front of me today ordered salads that looked good so now I want to try one nlext time I go.

Love the U of A support!"}
{"text":"As many others have expressed... it's a average place. Not bad but not fantastic either. It has a prime location and a few things it does very well. It's affordable which is something that I wish I could say about more places in the area. There is a real need for quick and cheap places around here as the numerous sit down places with wait staff aren't going to work every day. The staff is friendly. The pizza toppings are good and the slice size is good as well. The one thing I wish is that the pizza was slightly thicker... I like thin crust pizza but I have found that maybe it's just a little too thin for my taste. This might just be a me thing though. So if you are faced with the choice of Subway or here in the Arizona center Roma will win every time."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, friendly people. The southwest salad is great, as is the baked ziti. And whenever we want to feed our office building, they are the first I call."}
{"text":"this pizza was so gross that i just now created my first yelp account.  yes, it is 2013. that's just how gross this pizza was."}
{"text":"The food is always awesome! At work we routinely order 3-5 plates and we've never had a problem. Today I was inspired to yelp about Cafe Roma because I asked for eggplant instead of chicken on my chicken alfredo. Pretty much amazing. I had everyone I work with try it!

The pasta dishes are all very good, wraps are super tasty, subs are good, the calzones and strombolis are amazing, decent prices, clean and friendly atmosphere. Service has always been good for me, Ive eaten at the Cafe a 2-3 times, and I've had it delivered many times. 

To wrap it up, I'd recommend eating here to anyone!"}
{"text":"All the food here is reheated right in front of you. However, I would be able to overlook that if the food tasted decent. I love pasta and don't know how you can go wrong with baked ziti, but somehow they did. It was bland and the noodles were overcooked. Terrible."}
{"text":"The pizza is GOOD. The prices are GOOD. The people who run the place are friendly, and it's locally owned. If you don't like this place, you're probably spoiled and used to going to lame places to eat. Never disappointed here. You get your food fast and it tastes great."}
{"text":"When I worked over in this area, I frequented Cafe Roma often. The service is always friendly, the food is spot on and the restaurant is clean. 

Recommendations: 
- Breakfast: 
   French Toast Special (2 french toast, 2 bacon & 2 eggs) 
   Breakfast Burrito (eggs, cheese, potatoes and bacon is my fav.)
- Lunch: 
   Grilled Chicken, bacon & avocado sandwich is *AWESOME!*
   Philly Steak salad is good (add avocado too it to make it even better)
   Meatballs and Garlic Knots (both are sides but sometimes a couple meatballs and a couple knots for dipping is a great meal.) 

The pizza is good too, but honestly the items listed above are what i got 90% of the time. Give them a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This post is bias: I am a U of A fan.

But honestly this is a great joint. Love the pizzas, and I mean them all chicken BBQ Wednesday!!!!! Cheesecake is yum. Peace tea!!! Where can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Had Cafe Roma for lunch.  I had the California Turkey wrap... ermahgah! that thing was huge. It kept me full most of the day... really good turkey and the avocado was fresh. It was a good time. I would totally do it again."}
{"text":"I was just updating my profile and one of the questions was: What would be your last meal?  I had to think about it a little and then the baked ziti from Cafe Roma at the Arizona Center, popped into the taste buds in my memory brain cells.   This prompted me to share this, my humble opinion, with everyone. I've been going there for many years now. I ALWAYS get the Baked Ziti because, well, because it's delicious! Their sauce is sooo good and cheesy, and the portion size is gigantic.  Their pasta also comes with the most amazing garlic rolls. They are super garlicky, savory, and pillowy soft. They kind of melt in your mouth, really. Hmm, maybe those rolls might be my last meal???  A few years ago, I stopped going as often, not because the food wasn't good, but because the place wasn't that great. It was hot and the seating was really crowded. 

Well, imagine my surprise when I went back for that wonderful Baked Ziti a few weeks ago and the place was newly remodeled. There were new tables, a new seating configuration and a wall wonderland surrounded by big screen tv's. Their pizza is also delicious. It is true that it's reheated when you order it; but it's still pretty darn tasty though. The price is alright, plan on spending about $10 per meal.  If you've never been there, you should give it a shot. Tell them Trish sent you.  That  won't mean a damn thing to them.  However, the next time I go, i'll tell them I'm Trish and referred a bajillion people to eat there. Who knows, I might get a free baked ziti."}
{"text":"Went here today with my roommate. The lunch special was a great price, however the overall taste wasn't so great. My pizza was very soggy and the cheese was not fully melted. It tasted like pizza you heat up in the microwave. The salad wasn't too bad, but not so great either. It was okay, I doubt I will be returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Cafe Roma!. We have traveled extensively in Italy and the Sicilian lady who owns this place is one of the sweetest people you will ever meet.

The vegetable and supreme pizzas are amazing, especially if they put some feta cheese on top. Their pasta with meat sauce, although simple, is extremely tasty, as well. Between the food and the atmosphere, I'll be sure to come back here often."}
{"text":"Still loving Cafe Roma! The baked ziti and garlic knots are delicious. If it's Wednesday tho, the Cilantro Lime Marinated Grilled Chicken Sandwich it is!!! If you're in the are stop in. Prices are great too!"}
{"text":"I love getting pizza here at lunchtime! The owners are super cool, too. Even if I'm an ASU fan. My favorite is the white pizza with ricotta and spinach. Amazing."}
{"text":"Ok, it is what it is.  And it does it well.

A simple pizza by the slice fare.  I have found the Pizza pretty good.  Last night I had a Med Salad that was pretty good, not too creative (romain lettuce, feta, banana peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes (no olives)).  

The atmosphere is nicer than a quick fast food pizza by the slice joint and they did have a wide selection of beers."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The lady that helped me was super friendly. The pizza was really good. Really crispy and delicious. They also have happy hour between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. everyday. $2.50 Bud Light pints and $4 pitchers. They also have wine and other alcoholic choices available all the time. The only bummer about this place is that they require a $5 minimum purchase if you use a credit or debit card, but the pizza is good enough that you will want an extra slice anyways."}
{"text":"Love this family owned business!  Food is amazing and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Sat down for late dinner with wife. Cool sports bar ambience in the Arizona center in DT PHX.  Good selection of pizza and pasta.  I settled for the margherita pizza. YuM.!! Wife had pepperoni. Good choice of beer. Patrons come in for a quick slice and beer!  
4 big screen TV' on the wall for sports fanatics. Patio seating avail."}
{"text":"Good food,reasonable price, fast service, clean place. Also, enjoy talking to the owner Mike."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great daily specials - friendly staff - Thankful they're so close to my work. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner a few nights ago with my wife and a friend.  It was a Wednesday night at about 8pm.  The place was dead.  All 15 or so tables were empty.  WTF.  We were there for over an hour and only like 3 people wandered in during our meal to pickup food and that was it.  I have no idea how this place stays in business.  Especially since it has been there for forever.

Anyway, our waiter was very good/quick/friendly but I could tell he really didn't understand why we were there.  I'm guessing that the place is primarily a lunch place and a takeout place.  He got our orders right and my diet cokes were quickly refilled.

To start we ordered a bottle of wine.  We could tell from the waiter's reaction that this does not happen often.  All the bottles were like 20ish dollars so what the heck.

Here is what we ordered:

* House Salad = very good
* Chicken Parm = good, big
* Pizza = unexpectedly very good.  We ordered the white pizza with ricotta cheese..  I asked and our waiter said it was made fresh which was surprising.
* Greek Salad = I didn't try this but it looked pretty good.  Not sure why but the waiter asked what kind of dressing they wanted on it.  I thought all Greek salads came with basically the same dressing.  Oh well....Italian dressing it is.

I really don't want to knock a little local establishment.  The place is just ok.  Our waiter was good, the food was good, and the price was good.  It is one of the last places within walking distance of my house that I hadn't tried yet and I can now cross if off my list.  It wasn't horrible so of course I would go back but I certainly won't rush back."}
{"text":"Friendly friendly friendly staff. This alone made me decide to be a repeat customer. I'm in love with the Santa Fe wrap; every ingredient is perfect. The pasta salad side is cooked perfectly,  but the dressing is abundant and there really isn't anything in it other than noodles...I got maybe 1 olive slice. I'm looking forward to trying the Wed special though. Expect to pay about $8 to $10 for lunch with a drink unless you want a slice."}
{"text":"Nothing really impressive about this place.

I've tried the pizza, which I suppose wasn't terrible, but definitely not something I'd recommend. They do the fully cooked but pre-prepared pizzas, and re-heat for a minute in the oven. There are places that can do this right, like NYPD, but these guys didn't really deliver a high quality slice.

Today I went with the chicken parmesan, which included a garlic knot and baked ziti. The pasta was pretty bland, and the meat didn't have much substance to it. The garlic knot was decent, but not good enough to turn the meal around."}
{"text":"Cafe Roma is an ol staple that my coworkers and I usually hit up during lunch time considering its a short 2 minute walk.  They have a pretty good selection of italian eats, but their main grub to offer is pizza.  

The pizza selection is pretty good offering the classics with a few other creative varieties.  My favorite being the pepperoni/jalapeno.  Average price for a slice with one topping is about $3.50 which isn't to bad at all.  The other items range in price, but you can usually find something for under $10.  Although they only have around 3 beers on tap (which they could use a little more of) the prices are pretty good for a pint.  I can get a pint for $3 and during their happy hour they had em going for $2 which was great.

The newly remodeled look gives Cafe Roma a more updated, spiffier look  while maintaining its quaint italian charm.  Located nicely in the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix, it has its good selection of clientele.   If you're looking for a quick lunch time bite during work, school or shopping, Cafe Roma is a good choice."}
{"text":"This was our second try at eating here. This place has a great location and I love pizza so we thought we would grab some dinner after a movie. The first time was pretty bad, the woman didn't know what to do with our coupon, so it took forever to order. We had a pitcher of beer (not a good selection on tap) and waited for our pizza. About twenty minutes later she brings some wings to our table because she completely forgot about our pizza. It was nice that she brought us some complimentary wings, but when the pizza finally came out it was burned and incredibly greasy. 

We decided to give the place one more shot. The second time we got there and it was not busy at all, but it took a while before anyone came to the counter to take our order.  We ordered a couple of beers from the bottles they had on display only to find that they didn't have any and we were stuck with the two tap choices again. It took about 30 minutes to get our pizza. It looked like it was cooked well, but it was incredibly greasy again and the dough was rock hard. We will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"There isn't anything I have had there that isn't wonderful.  Very reasonably priced, and the food is exceptional. One of my new favorites."}
{"text":"Old counter Pizza that they stick in the oven to reheat when you order.

Decided to try this place for the first time today. Got in at about noon. no desire to go back again."}
{"text":"Pizzeria type atmosphere. But prices are high for a pizza and they dont have spaghetti. Pizza was good. People are nice but hard to hear behind the high glass counter."}
{"text":"Really loved the pizza, thin crust, comes out so hot the cheese is just an oily liquid for a couple of mins until it cools off. The dough they use for the crust is really good too, Calzone was solid, the marinara dipping suace was really good. We also got a side salad which was big and wasnt just plain old iceberg, which is always nice. There were only 2 people working dinner and they both seemed to be busting their butts to do a good job. The girl working the counter was very nice and polite."}
{"text":"I work acrossed the street from this restaurant & decided today was my day to try them. I am very glad I did, because the service is top-notch and their employees are very friendly! 

I was in a salad kind of mood, so I ordered their House Salad, sans the cucumbers & croutons, Bleu Cheese dressing, & a drink to go. They gave me extra dressings, seeing the size of the salad was big. I went with ice cold Green Tea to drink. 

This restaurant is decked out with University of Arizona decor & stuffed Wilburs. I LOVE that!

This place was packed when I went, being it was lunchtime, but what keeps it from getting all 5 stars? The size of the place. Tables too close together & I felt claustrophobic due to so many people in there & so limited space."}
{"text":"The menu is pretty small. The people that work here are the nicest ever and make a point to get to know your name. It's really friendly. The pizza is the only thing I'd probably order a second time. The baked ziti has a somewhat watery quality so I wouldn't really recommend that."}
{"text":"So this was my first time to Cafe Roma.  I went to pick up a pizza to take back to 27 Tattoo for us and our artist.  Ordered the Roman Supreme COLOSSAL (20+ inches).  It was AMAZING.  Even the crust was nummylicious.  And the cost was $18.95.  You can't beat that!  What stood out even more than the food was the friendly staff.  The young man who made our pizza chatted away with us while he fashioned it.  The other employees were so nice as well.  When we order pizza, we normally get it w/ light sauce.  I'm not usually the one to order so I forgot to request that.  No need, it was the perfect amount anyway!  We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Tale of a pie...

What makes a good pizza?  I mean, we can all admit to eating some pretty horrible pizza right? Yet, we still eat it...I mean \"even bad pizza is good pizza\".  Especially at 2am after a night out...but this visit to Cafe Roma was for lunch.

In my opinion...it's all in the crust.  I am not a fan of a very thick crust.  Like at all.  This crust...thin, crispy, flavorful and just all around  yummy!  Large thin slices and plenty of toppings!  

Hopefully I can go back and try that summer salad...looks amazing!"}
{"text":"I stumble across this place be I missed my bus. But I've been coming here every week since. Baked ziti omg. Pizzas holy divinity. Garlic knots ordered a dozen. All hail cafe Roma. Love Dawn."}
{"text":"Tired it for lunch... It was ok.  It is pizza.  The crust was doughy.  Never can beat NY pizza in NYC strrets."}
{"text":"Cafe Roma just went downhill since it has been in the Arizona Center for the last decade. They have whole pizzas ready and when you order a slice they reheat it in the oven for you, not a bad idea but then I saw a fly crawling on the pizzas right in front of me so I chose not to get a pizza. I chose the ziti which was okay the cheese didn't really taste like anything and the sauce was just weird. It came with a salad which was laughable because it was literally just two small pinches of salad with an overdose of dressing. I don't think I will be back here again after having been a long time customer."}
{"text":"Consistent! 
That's what you get when you come here.
I come here for a quick lunch from time to time and this place does not disappoint. 

The pizza, salads and a must try Ziti will leave you full, happy and on your way

I also like that they are locally owned.

My personal favorite is the Buffalo Chicken Salad."}
{"text":"Have to say I was not impressed. The service was simply ok and we had a variety of the menu options but nothing was more than mediocre.  Simple Alfredo with little spunk, the garlic chicken spaghetti had no garlic flavor but I will say the chicken was well cooked and tasty. The green chile pizza has no green chile but rather they tried to pass green bell pepper off as green chile. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Huge slices at decent prices. I have had the spinach & ricotta, tomato basil, pepperoni and meat lovers and they were all pretty good! I work nearby so it is super convenient to get my fat kid Friday slice and the workers have all been pretty cool too."}
{"text":"I've passed Cafe Roma numerous times on several previous business trips to Pheonix and always kept on going because from the outside it didn't look any better than what you'd find in your typical mall food court.  Boy, was I wrong.  A colleague and I stopped in for a quick lunch and I ordered the the meatball sub.  It was served on homemade bread which was really quite delicious.  The bread definitely made the sandwich.  I'll be back to try other offerings soon - probably the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Delicious place to get some pizza, very surprised by how good it was. Seems to be family owned? Nice people, shouldn't be overlooked."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and delicious food.  Their pizza crust is amazing and service is efficient and friendly for my 30 minute lunch break.  They try y o be environmentally conscious too.  I love supporting awesome local businesses."}
{"text":"Sadly, the family that originally owned Cafe Roma sold this location off.  We have only experienced it once since then and have no plans on going back.  Although I like the way the new owners updated the location, they pretty much took great pizza and replaced it with the cheapest ingredients possible and then jacked up the prices.  We didn't even want to finish what we had ordered.  We took it to go and gave it away to a homeless person."}
{"text":"Wow this place sucks.  We were in a hurry to go ice skating down the street, so we popped into the first place we saw that was open and not crowded.  We ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich after looking at the prices for pizza.  A tiny personal pizza was about $7.  The sandwich was also $10, but we figured we'd split it.  They asked us if we'd like a large and we said yes after some thought.  It came out about 45 minutes later.  It was literally just an overbaked piece of chicken and some cheese on some crappy bread.  It was tiny.  I'd hate to see what the \"regular\" size was.  What a waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"I'm blessed and feel fortunate to have this restaurant within walking distance from my new job (as there aren't very many food places around).

Lunch crowd gets thick around 12-1:30pm ish, but they also have patio seating (w/bumbershoots) outside in front. And, they do carry-outs also.

I highly recommend the Italian (cold) sandwich. Superb!! Fresh meat and veggies used and *the perfect* amount of spices/seasonings. Blows Subway Italian sammys out of the water. 

Price-points are fair and I've never seen any of the servers/cashiers with frown. Friendly interaction and no mean-spirited trash-talk among cashiers during down-times, which I always seem to notice at other places like this one. 

It is very pro-University of Arizona also."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Very good lunch place . All their pizzas and sandwiches are delicious. Very friendly and quick customer service . The baked ziti is awesome"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are amazing!  Includes potatoes, eggs, cheese, and meat for only about $3.  Really great!  Better than Filiberto's which is next door.

Pizza is okay, but I usually opt for either the baked ziti or the meatball parmesan sub.  The ziti portion is huge, with parmesan and extra marinara on top.  The meatball sub is the best one I've had at any sub places around.  Delicious!  Almost better the next day if you pop it under the broiler for a couple minutes to get the bread toasty and crunchy.

Staff is great, helpful, and service is fast!"}
{"text":"First visited Cafe Roma in september when my parents were in town, thoroughly enjoyed the pizza. Once my fiance and myself decided to chose a venue for our wedding very close to Cafe Roma, we talked to them about catering for our wedding, and we came in to sample some other foods on the menu. We were both completely blown away by the sandwhiches, pastas, salads, ribs that we tried, and the coup de grace, a desert pizza with Reeses peanut butter cups!! I strongly recommend that people come down town phoenix and check out this awesome establishment!!!!!

{"text":"I can't believe I've been to this place twice, but when I'm at the Arizona Center for an event, I'm short on time, and I'm hungry, this is actually the best place to get a quick bite.

It's your average takeout pizza/pasta joint, like a mom and pop Sbarro. I've only ever had pizza here as the pasta isn't a quick deal. The sad part is that the last time I was there especially, I didn't even remember eating there shortly after, because I was still hungry. Not very filling.

Also, just a note that if you plan on just grabbing a beer here, and want to pay with a card, there's a $5 min for card transaction. In that situation, either pay with cash, or grab some sun chips, which put it at the minimum level."}
{"text":"Believe it or the breakfast burrito are awesome especially for the price. Will be coming back everyday for the convenience, speed and quality of the location. Might get pizza at one point but for now the burritos are doing it for me."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS would have been a perfect rating.

FOOD: As far as I'm concerned, the best thing available at Cafe Roma are the calzones. The cazlones' cheese, sauce, and bread are all pretty good. They are huge and decently priced. One calzone could feed two non-starving people. I usually have to struggle to finish one. Other dishes are decent, but nothing to come back for. 

PRICE: A calzone and a drink cost about $9-10. 

ATMOSPHERE: It's a typical low-cost Italian restaurant. TV's in the corners, music playing in the background, a couple decorations on the walls. Good place for lunch or modest dinner. 

SERVICE: Nice people, but they can be almost too helpful at times. Sometimes they come by the table four times during the meal to ask if everything is alright. Sometimes I want to shout, \"Yes! Everything is wonderful, now leave us alone!\" They know I get the calzone every time I go there, it's a cool feeling to have that regular status.

SKINNY: Try the calzone, I think its pretty good. If it's not good, then I'm sorry I wasted all this time writing this review only to lead you astray."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to Cafe Roma?  I used to LOVE this place.  Well, love is kind of a strong word but I sure as hell ate there a lot.

They used to have the best lunch special around.  A slice of pizza and a salad for $3 and some change.  It was awesome.  Was the pizza great?  Of course not.  How about the \"salad\" (and I use that term loosely because it looked more like the chopped up lettuce and tomatoes you'd find at a taco bar)?  Well, I think my brief description pretty much answers that.  But it was $3 and I didn't care.  The broker I got, the more I ate there.  It was a wonderful relationship.  

And then I walked in around 2:15 yesterday to grab a bite there for the first time in 2009 and everything changed.  I ordered my lunch special of a slice and salad like always, and went up to the register to pay, and the guy working the counter looked at me and goes \"$6.49 please.\"

I almost passed out.  I thought it was a joke.  Who does Cafe Roma think they are??  I understand that times are tough and maybe they have to raise prices a bit to stay afloat, but almost doubling their prices??? No no no my friend, not cool.  For a shitty reheated slice of pizza that had been sitting out for 3 hours and some taco dressings.

I looked up at the guy and asked him when they raised their prices, and he ignored me!!!  He heard me ask the question, looked at me square in the eyes, and turned around and walked away.  Anyone who has met me knows that I do not take being ignored very well.

I went to sit down at my table fuming mad and started eating, thinking about all the things I was going to write in my Yelp review, looked down, and saw a gnat crawl out of my salad.  Swear to God!!! 

I almost threw up, stood up, and walked out.

Downgrade!!!"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, and very much like NY style pizza.  The slices are thin, with a very crispy crust, with good sauce to topping ratio.  A good choice for quick eats at the Arizona Center."}
{"text":"I love this place and love their pizza!  They have other items like spaghetti, lasagna, and other Italian dishes that I have tried but I go there for the Pizza!  I usually go at lunch and get the 2-slice and Coke option for about $6-8 depending on if I get specialty slices.  On Thursdays they sell my favorite pizza by the slice, the BBQ chicken pizza.  I love the big slices, great cheese they use, and big chunks of chicken and other meat.  The staff is always friendly and efficient.  We have even ordered several Pizzas through them for work parties and they are always great!  The only caveat is that they are only a few miles from ASU but they have UofA stuff plastered everywhere, it doesn't bother me but just an FYI for you ASU fans."}
{"text":"Family-run Italian restaurant in downtown Phoenix (near the AMC multiplex). Pizzas by the slice or by the pie. I agree with the yelp post by Heidi V. that ordering a whole pizza is the way to go! Just be patient... Rome wasn't built in a day...

Also, highly recommend the salads with lots of cheese and their bread.

Cafe Roma had the best aroma of the casual restaurants I checked out at the Arizona Center. 

Extra note for all you Italian language learners / speakers... there is a lovely Sicilian woman who prepares the food, I believe her name is Crocetta. I found her to be delightful and happy to converse in Italian! 

Ciao for now"}
{"text":"Today was my 3rd visit to this restaurant and I have tried something different to get a feel for what foods they make better.  I would have to say that the pizza is the better choice when picking from their menu.

1st visit I tried the Baked Ziti and found it to be OK, nothing special about it.  For the price I felt that Oreganoes would have been a better choice.

2nd visit I decided to buy two slices, pepperoniand hawaiian slices, both were good but a little over priced.  You can go to NYPD and get the same slices and sizes for a better value.

3rd visit I went for the Chicken Parmesan Lunch Special was dissappointed with the quality of the chicken and look of the food once I got to my table.  I knew looks aren't everything when it comes to food so I went on eating the meal.  The first few bites into the chicken were just OK and then the next bite was like bitting into chicken that had just come out of the fridge.  This surprised me since the chicken parmesan is sitting under heat lamps and in a warming tray.  Also with the lunch special was baked ziti which saved the Lunch Special.

I am going to assume that the chicken sub sandwiches aren't that good since my friend basically picked his sandwich apart and just ate the chicken pieces.

To recap, stick with the pizza by the slice or buy a whole pie; from now on when I go back that is what I will be getting, pizza by the slice."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times I have lost count.  I eat here mainly because I work in the Arizona Center, and its literally right out my door.

The pizza here is okay at best.  I find it a little on the greasy side.  I usually get the pepperoni pizza, but have had the Tomato and basil as well.  The pizza is okay.  Its just to greasy for my tastes.

On the up side, they do have some pretty good lasagna, along with a few other dishes that I would reccomend."}
{"text":"It's apparent when you go to a restaurant and it's always packed how good it must be. Not only do they have great service, they also have the best Salads!!! 

I go in there almost everyday for lunch and get the Santa Fe salad it's so good!!! Highly recommend for Pizza, Garlic Knots and salad."}
{"text":"At a certain point, the bad service goes from amusing to just intolerably bad.  Taking over an hour to eat at a lunch time place is a no go.   Offering to refill two people's diet Pepsi and then switching the glasses is something we avoided on this particular trip, but has happened in the past.   Really only go here if you aren't on a schedule and don't mind fairly mediocre food."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars instead of one is because I was able to eat the food without getting sick. The restaurant is about 80 degrees, not ideal in Arizona in June. That sets the mood for the place right away. 

I ordered the Friday special...pepperoni calzone. It was more like a pepperoni roll because it had no ricotta. Up your game fellas, ricotta in a calzone is a must. I also had a bite of a garlic knot, but that was just a waste of time. 

Some other things that added to the experience were that the water button on the soda machine didn't work and they have a picture with a big beer, but don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. Huge pizza slices for only 3 dollars. Melts like butter in your mouth, the crust is amazing! Asu students get discounts."}
{"text":"I have lunch here at least 2 times a week, and the food has always been good, affordable, and fast. My only suggestion would be to add some flavor to the garlic knots, pretty bland. Other than that, good lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I so desperately want to like Cafe Roma. It is a small place with a take-out area and a dining room. When you walk it, it smells incredible. I have yet to have something that tastes like the smell.

I've had the Penne with meat sauce. The pasta was overcooked and the meat sauce was average. The lasagna is above average and threatens to be good, but doesn't quite make it.

The side salad is okay as far as such things go. It consists of mostly iceburg lettuce with a middle eastern type olive thrown in and a sprinkling of some kind of field green. The salad dressings I've tried are bottled.

There is a daily pasta special."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for lunch probably 3 times each week for the past 2 years.  I love the food and the variety.  They have a spaghetti and meatballs special on Mondays that I'll often get.  I love their pastrami sandwich.  I think their pizza is amongst the best around.  Angie's Summer Salad is the best as it's chicken, blue cheese, carmalized pecans and strawberries with the greens.  The people working there are friendly and I like their frequent customer cards in which every 10th meal is free.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Hour prices are good, the food is great, and good protions sizes also.   Nice to sit outside and people watch.  And the staff are super friendly"}
{"text":"The pizza: total bullocks. Tasteless, crust is gross, toppings are suspect. 

Pasta: not great, tastes like it is all from a can. WAY too pricey; baked zitti will cost $7.50 for a pretty small amount. Give me a break. 

Sandwiches: CRAP! I mean really bad.... Bread is nasty, and the meats are sub-par. Veggies are nasty as well...

Breakfast burritos: actually really good."}
{"text":"Recently visiting the Phoenix area and came across Cafe Roma.  Group of 8 for lunch.  We each ordered different things and EVERYTHING was very tasty.  We had a pepperoni/black olive pizza (12\").....the pizza had a lot of cheese (yum), plenty of pepperoni and olives.  The crust was very tasty....and I don't usually like the crusty edges.  We will for sure visit Cafe Roma the next time we are in Phoenix!!!!!"}
{"text":"Roma is now called Boka and that isn't the only change we don't like. The staff is rude and the pizza is only ok and, served by the slice cold and stiff. When they had only one customer in the place Tiffany told us that we would have to wait an hour for a fresh pizza, or we could take slices that had been on display for hours. BTW those slices would not be covered by our Groupon, where a fresh made whole pizza would have. Scam."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant because it was close to the hotel I was staying at. The food was just OK. I had the dinner special which included a salad, drink, & chicken parmesan for $8.95. On the salad, I could tell the ranch dressing came out of a bottle - consistency was VERY thick. The chicken parmesan was nothing special - a piece of chicken with cheese and sauce. The one thing I was impressed with was the bread. It says they make the bread fresh and it tastes that way. YUM! If you are in a hurry, I would suggest ordering a piece of pizza from the warmer in the window. Otherwise you may be waiting for a while. 
Positives: Cheap food, large portions, good bread. 
Negatives: Service was slow - I ordered my food to go and sat around waiting for a while."}
{"text":"Kind of surprised this place only has one review from 2008.  In any case, six of us came here for lunch last week.  Three of us got pizza and three got calzones.  It seemed like the calzone folks were the most satisfied, they raved about it for the rest of the afternoon.  A couple of them also got slices of tiramisu and said it was fabulous.  I got a slice of pizza and a side salad.  My salad was fresh and my slice of pizza was pretty large too so I think their portions are fine.  I thought the pizza was okay but I didn't fall in love with it, it was mostly the sauce I didn't like (it was pretty sweet).  Overall I think this place is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars but I rounded up because the employees were friendly and they have a good variety of stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Bottom Line - Great tasting sandwiches and salads served in an East Coast Deli style with thorough U of A decor.

Service - 4/5 Friendly and engaged staff made everyone in the long but fast moving line feel welcome.

Personality - 4/5 Serving style straight from the East Coast combined with U of A sports memorabilia everywhere.  There was a great energy and buzz about the place.

Quality - 5/5 I ordered the hot pastrami and provolone sandwich which was served with fresh (cold) salad as the sandwich garnish.  The meat was seasoned perfectly and the crunch from the cold vegetables was a great combination.  One of my fellow diners had the daily sandwich special and said it was delicious as well.  

Recommendation - 4/5 If I worked in this area on a regular basis this would be a one or two times a week spot.  Definitely worth the visit if you can make it."}
{"text":"All right, here is the deal with this place.

The food here is sub par.  I would even have to say that the pizza here, well, it's shit.  The slices I have gotten there have probably been sitting out for at least an hour or more, and are \"warmed\" up in the oven when you order it.  usually, all this does is burn the top of the cheese and toppings but still leaves the middle as cold as the heart of Chucky, the good guys doll from the movie \"Child's Play\"  I'm not sure what the difference between this Cafe Roma and the one about a mile or two south has,but their pizza is much better.  It seems that this location really cheaps the fuck out on the amount of cheese on their pizza.  I'm also sure the sauce is just Ragu or Prego.  Seriously, times aren't that tough.

Same for a lot of the dishes they have in the warming trays.  That food all tastes like it has been sitting there for hours before it is served.  Pasta dishes seem to be better then the pizza, but I've had more than one person tell me I'm fucking nuts for saying that.  The garlic knots would be pretty decent if they weren't so goddamn stale.  I think I almost chipped a tooth off of them.

Now that awfulness is behind us, I do have to give them credit for their service.  Even with a long line, they get through the customers pretty quick, always seem to go a bit of an extra mile to make sure you are having a good day and that they get your food out to you as quick as possible.  Seems like they honestly care about your experience there.  I just wish they would ask me that after I have eaten there.

Cafe Roma of Priest and Washington, I urge you to get the food platform of your southern Cafe Roma, and transfer it to this location.  Then, good sirs, you will receive more stars.  Until then, the heartburn and runs your establishment typically gives me will only merit 3 start from me.  Your service is what has saved you for now.  Go forth and be the mecca of fast italian eatery you can be."}
{"text":"Cafe Roma is decent.  No better no worse, it's just decent.  The restaurant itself is very dark inside, which makes it hard to read the chalk-written menu hanging 10 feet up in the air.  They offer a decent selection of standard pizzeria fare including pizza, pastas, and subs.  I've never had their pizza strangely enough, but every time I see people eating it, it looks tasty.  I've had their subs here before and I find them extremely lacking.  Surprisingly enough, I get more meat on my sandwich next door at subway than I do here.  The bread is also really crusty.  Sometimes I like that, sometimes not, but be warned, it can break your teeth if you aren't careful.  The first time I came here, I ordered pasta, but they said they were out of it and I found this really weird, especially since it was like 5 pm.  I figured they just had vats of sauces and tubs of pasta in the back and they slopped it all together when you ordered it.  Oh well.  Another time I came back and tried the pasta again, this time they had it.  It was pretty decent and their marinara sauce isn't bad.   Use a plastic fork if you are going to eat pasta here because there is something really wrong with their forks.  I swear the metal rubs off when you eat because you get a wicked metallic flavor when using their forks.  Overall, a pretty decent place if you are looking for a quick dinner before heading over to a movie at the AMC."}
