{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday and got 2 gyros for 5.99! Food. Great. Atmosphere. Great. Customers and employees. Great. I ate one gyro there and took one home and ate it the next day. It was fantastic both times !!! The bar itself is also amazing during the night life, very great atmosphere for students!"}
{"text":"Fast Service. Great Prices (2 for Tuesdays!).  Incredible food and many choices.  If you are looking for a quick dinner or lunch idea, you can't go wrong with Euro Gyro.   I highly recommend the Fried Mushrooms and Poppers as a side.  Not watery.  Came out perfectly crisp and delicious.  Every positive review is correct, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Greasy but good food. Delivery takes awhile and they never give you a time estimate which is frustrating. Usually takes an hour or so for delivery."}
{"text":"The best place to eat in Kent. Always open. definitely order gyro $3.99 or two for $6"}
{"text":"Like any bar / restaurant, Euro Gyro has its ups and downs.   From a food perspective, the best thing they offer are chicken wings (get them crispy!). They also have a really great wing sauce selection. Shrimp 'or' tenders & jojos are also awesome too. Easy go-to delivery option.   If you're gonna order pizza late night / 3am, the pizza is hit or miss. Just look at the picture reviews. But if you go into the place, the pizza is usually pretty decent.   From a delivery perspective, you really gotta know the right times to order or just get lucky. Live in Kent for a few years and you'll have it down. Sounds ridiculous but that's just how it is:  Thursdays and Saturdays are super busy, sometimes it can take 1.5 hours to get food. But, order from whenever they open til 830 or 9pm pm on any day of the week and you're good for fast delivery.  On the weekends (especially Thursdays and Saturdays), 930/10pm-1am is super busy. 2-3am is a toss up.   Best part about this place, and why I rate these guys pretty well is because they DELIVER BEER. Having no car and not being close to stores, beer delivery is super convenient."}
{"text":"didn't eat or drink here, so i will not comment about that.  one pinball machine in great working order - Playboy.  the whole machine is clean and all of the triggers, bumpers, plus most of the lights worked on this machine as of this posting.  the machine would get 5 stars, but, it's well, Playboy.  it just can't get 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place fed me twice a week through college, and is one of the many fine institutions that is  responsible for my future heart attack :) I miss spicy garlic chicken wings in my life!"}
{"text":"Gyro is a good bet for late night snacks if you do not want the ordinary pizza or taco bell. My only advice would be to order it well before you are actually hungry because they do take their time delivering. They used to have a problem with incorrect orders and when that did happen we experienced rather rude responses when we called to report the issue. This problem seems to have resolved itself, or at least I hope it has.   I love their hot wings, they are hotter than a lot of wings and meaty. Their other wing sauces are worth a try as well. Recently I discovered that they use a rather divine BBQ sauce, it is tangy with the right balance of sweetness. That sauce is excellent with their chicken fingers, with are rather large and well done. Gyros are always a safe bet, they have good cucumber sauce. We often get cheeseburger foldovers and stromboli but you do run the risk of having some undercooked dough with those.   Best of all, they are dirt cheap. They have $5 deals for carry out and dine in that will actually fill you up. They also have a wide variety of specials and deals to get you more food for cheap."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza in Kent! Delivery takes quite awhile on nights and weekends and there is a $10 delivery minimum. I usually just get carry-out because it's faster. The actual bar is nothing fancy, just your typical college town dive bar. Great place to get beer and pizza with a few friends. This is NOT a wait service restaurant. You do have to go and order your food at the bar. So the service isn't 5-star, but the food, the price, and the atmosphere are worth checking this place out."}
{"text":"I love their Wednesday pizza deal. I would definitely try their white sauce on their pizzas. It is to die for.   Their food is a little greasy but it is fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Euro-Gyro offers an intense selection of everything from pizza to gyros to calzones and an assortment of sandwiches. On Wednesday they offer $5.50 large one toppers until closing time. This place will deliver cases of beer and cigarettes to your house with your pizza. Or you can go pick up your pizza, beer and cigarettes. Be careful after 9 though, they will often shift over into +21 mode, and minors will be forced to walk somewhere else for their pizza, beer and cigarettes. But all in all that is the kind of place this is. The perfect pizza/dive bar for a beat up college town."}
{"text":"I love \"The Gyro's\" pizza. This place rocks the taste of food. Sadly, this place does NOT ROCK when it comes to the crew and their demeanor. On many occasions they've had an attitude, have taken FOREVER to make the food, and have been pissy about answering questions.. it always seems like you're bothering the staff by even being there!  Overall, it's a great place for tasty bar/pub pizza.. just be willing to wait an hour and a half for the pizza to be made."}
{"text":"Last night the owner was acting extremely rude during a great Metal concert BECAUSE she didnt want there to be a concert in the first place we found out later! Go Defy Reality! A Sense of Purpose and others sorry cant remember name. But the owner was ranting how people shouldn't buy drinks unless they tip her so when we first didnt hear this we bought a redds she charged us $4 we gave her $5 told her keep the change. Then later other bartender when we bought another one redds was $3 and said keep the change and was like.. Wait a second... So the owner overcharged us and kept the $2 for herself so she could get extra tip. Like really WTF!! We found out after. So this so called owner would rather you not buy any drinks than buy drinks and not tip? Your the owner lots of owners dont get tips... I work in the service industry I dont get tips rarely if ever because I am the owner and I dont jip my customers. Be careful when you open your mouth and who hears it, just because the music is loud doesnt mean people arent listening."}
{"text":"Pretty quick food, pretty good. I went in when it was dead, so service was good and it was just a chill place."}
{"text":"Love this little place! They deliver late and are open late! Even has a sit down bar for when you want good bar food & good service. Fried ravioli bites are my favorite! Gotta try them!"}
{"text":"I had a gyro and a buffalo chicken salad, the gyro meat was very dry and I suspect it was old. The salad was not fresh and again the meat was dry. I have no desire to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Dive bar that slangs pizza. The pizza is OK, really good when you have been drinking all night. They serve food till 3:30am. The delivery can take a while to get and the pizza quality is hit or miss late night. The Greek pizza is good and so are the wings. i suggest the honey gold wings."}
{"text":"Euro Gyro was an enjoyable restaurant and I really loved the steak gyro I ordered. In addition, the service was wonderful. However, the bathroom did not have a mirror."}
{"text":"Gyros and pizzas are great here - try the Greek pizza if you can't decide which to have. Their white pizzas are very good too. They often have live bands on weekends if you want to eat in the bar."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza with lotsa garlic.  Best in town by far. The second-floor deck bar is a fun spot for drinking, snacking, and people watching. Looking forward to trying more items on the menu. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"While I have not yet been inside Kent's EuroGyro, so I can't say anything about the restaurant's cleanliness or anything, but we have ordered from them today.  We didn't feel like leaving our new residence,  and we were in the mood for pitas and chicken.  The person taking the order said they were swamped and that they'd be there in fifteen minutes.  They weren't kidding!  The delivery man was on our doorstep within fifteen minutes and had everything we ordered.  Not bad!  The food was filling and delicious! I had the Cheesy Buffalo Chicken pita and it was amazing!  I would definitely recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"Ok..so I am never eating here again..I ordered 4pitas and the guy delivered 2..! I told the delivery guy i ordered 4 but he as he was just the delivery guy I called them and they admitted that I ordered 4 pitas but the guy on the phone specifically said that he will not deliver it for free and when asked why he said \"its not my fault\". I mean come on..think about Euro gyro as a whole and not just if its your mistake or not. You are all Euro gyros employees. The guy was rude and did not listen to me. Never gonna order again from here. Gyro was not even worth 4 $."}
{"text":"This is a classic college town pizza shop and dive bar.  Inside, it smells like grease and old cigarettes. They just added a brand new multi-level patio not that long ago. Which is a really great addition for the smokers. This is one of the only places in town that keeps it's doors open until 3am.  Delivery can be a bit slow if you call and order during the bar rush!"}
{"text":"All food is to die for! Also nice to just go in for a drink since they have a full bar. It's a real hole in the wall place that has a dive bar feel, but that doesn't matter when the food is this good! Love that they're open so late."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for guilty pleasure food. If calories didn't exist, there isn't much better than a calzone, pepperoni pizza or gyro from EuroGyro. And there certainly isn't anything better than a pepperoni roll from here. It's top notch. I kind of want to order one as I write this review.   If you're looking for upscale, this isn't your place, and others are right, delivery can be slow. But it is what it is- A college town joint that serves great bar food and stays open way later than any bar downtown.   Check out their specials, there are some good deals if you check out their website! Especially Wednesday's, $5.99 for a large? Can't beat it...."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome! The staff always takes care of you and they follow that up with great food. They deserve a raise!!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love the Gyro?? EuroGyro is a FAVORITE for the inebriated late at night when everywhere else is closing. They serve a great menu very late. Exactly how you would like to end your night as a college student in a college town.  Positives:  - The food! Gyros are really good. The meat is better than most and the sauce is the right consistency and has a great flavor. The wings are not huge, but not tiny either and the sauces are what you crave. Two sandwiches that are a MUST try: The Guy on the Couch and the Chicken Hoagie Deluxe! They use good ingredients and will knock your socks off! The apps are so-so, definitely hit or miss.  - The prices. Very fair and a good bang for your buck.  - The hours. They are open late and deliver late. Sit down and eat, pick up and takeout, delivery, or eat right at the bar.  Negatives:  - The delivery time. Expect at the bare minimum an hour. Up to 2 hours depending on how busy they are.  -"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices!   Don't know what \"Brett A\" is talking about....  food always delivered in under a half hour!   Regardless of time or how busy they are!"}
{"text":"Favorite bar in Kent.  Food is awesome, best pizza in town and good prices.  Good gyro's .  Total dive bar.  The music is too loud, along with usually unfunny comedians.  Besides that, it rocks!  2 Dollar amberbock!!!"}
{"text":"I get heartburn sometimes. Some pizza will give me heartburn. Euro Gyro gave me such bad heartburn I threw up. The pizza isn't bad. It is typical NE Ohio hillbilly pizza but with some garlic crust. The Guy on the Couch sandwich was my friend Stoner Jon's favorite. He would always order it drunk while living in the dorms. There would always be empty beers and the remains of the Guy on the Couch laying on his floor on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday morning. Euro Gyro always seemed like a great idea late at night,  was a regret in the morning."}
{"text":"Being a former Kent student and resident I miss this pizza and their pepperoni rolls! It was such a great college staple and it didn't have that cardboard taste that some pizza places have with their dough. My biggest complaint was that sometimes they wouldn't be able to deliver until extremely late or they would completely forget about your order which would be frustrating."}
{"text":"Ah, eurogyro, my old friend.  I've been a fan of gyros all my life, and this place is one of the best.  The meat is SOOOOOoooo good.... I sometimes get a double meat and then add extra meat onto it (yes, yes my friends, you can do it, do it online, on the phone they sometimes get confused), and the jojos are a piece of edible art.  If you like meat, if you like it in copious quantities, go here my friends.  They also have pizza and beer, but every time I go in I get so distracted by tasty gyro I forget I wanted to try them."}
