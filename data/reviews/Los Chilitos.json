{"text":"i used to live in san diego so i got spoiled for incredible mexican food.  lots of people rave to me about los chillitos but honestly, i wasn't blown away.  their salsa/hot sauce selection is pretty depressing!  they brought out this gringo hot sauce that was all heat and no flavour--and i'm used to having a choice between salsa fresca, verde, rojo, etc.   most of the places i went to in sd (read: real mexican) had more veggie options, too. 

while i was there, i overheard another patron raving about how authentic this place was because it looked \"exactly like the restaurant at a resort in mexico\" .  i'd rather not eat somewhere that looks like a touristy resort restaurant, because when i go for ethnic cuisines, i want the real thing. 

i mean, this place is ok.  but i wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a great authentic Mexican restaurant.
We had a plate of taco chips with guacamole $7, we added a sampler salsa with 4 distinct and amazing salsa's for $3, we then needed more chips to finish our salsa and guacamole $2, so just the starter which did not fill you in any way shape or form cost $12.
A better option, and one my husband went with was the soup Pozole, just a small was $5 and it was HUGE- so my advice skip the chips and dip, hit the meaty soup instead.
I have no idea why I ordered red wine, do not do this they are not known for their wine. Instead opt for my second bevy the mojito- it was amazing. There was no alcohol taste, or overwhelming sweetness. It was just a mild refreshing mint drink that was very enjoyable. 
Our main dishes were amazing. I had the taco's; 3 taco's of your choice with beans and rice $13. Its funny because the smells are just as good as the taste, just smelling the food had me drooling! My husband had the burrito's again your choice of filling $13. 
To finish we had the flan $5, it really was the most tasteless flan I have ever had, but in saying that many people like it that way to clean the palate.
All in all the food is amazing quality, cost with drinks for 2 people $76, not too shabby for 17th ave but it could be better. I won't be going back until the summer though, it has a ridiculous entrance that makes you feel like you are in everyone's way- very very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Amazing mexican food. 
Went here on a Saturday evening about 6pm. The wait for the table was only a few minutes. This place is tiny though with a reasonable sized menu but I think thats why it so good.
Will be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been twice. Honestly, have no idea what the appeal is. Perhaps, due to its location, it gets lots of walk in traffic. The food is not very good at all. The meat, whether in a taco or enchilada, is bone dry, like eating sawdust; you can't even smother it with condiments such as pico de gallo or salsa to wash it down, because they give you a drop of each with your entree. Utterly ridiculous. Mexican cuisine has always been regarded as great value and great taste, not here. Even more egregious, is the service, it's terrible! The female servers are a little slow and inattentive, but there is a male supervisor (?), who conducts himself like he is the Head Cholo or Lead Ese Varto; he treats everyone with disdain, when entering or leaving the premises OR WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO INTERACT WITH HIM, he looks at you with a condescending glare. How repugnant. The last time we \"dined\" there, we were presented with a bill that was not reflective of the prices on the menu. When I inquired, I was told: \"THE PRICES HAVE ALL GONE UP IN OUR COMPUTER, BUT WE HAVEN'T CHANGED THEM ON OUR MENUS.\" WHAT???!!! This is tantamount to going to pay for an item at the Loonie Store, only to have the clerk tell you everything was $100, but they just haven't changed their price tags or signs. THIS PLACE IS AWFUL AND FRAUDULENT IN ITS PRACTICES. In a city lacking in good Mexican food, Los Chilitos is a personal affront to all in search of good taste."}
{"text":"I think I'm missing something. I just went to Los Chilitos in the Calgary Farmer's Market and I got the Soft Taco Plate, chicken, to go. I've never been to Los Chilitos before. I ordered and then waited around for my order, not paying much attention to how it was being prepared. I was just watching people walk around and the hustle and bustle of the market. Well, I got home, opened my take away container, and wow, um, really? This is what I paid $12.00 for? The farmers market is a pretty reasonably priced place to get a bite to eat, so I am surprised that my $12.00 taco \"plate\" is three corn tortillas with shredded chicken, and NOTHING else.

Luckily, I am at home, so I've put some fresh tomato, lettuce, onion, and some salsa that I have in my fridge on them. I will say, the chicken is tasty, but where is the rest of my lunch? Is this normal? Did they miss putting something on or with my dish?

Disappointed."}
{"text":"***update...I wont go back here. I took some friends here boasting about the great food only to sit at a table for HALF AN HOUR and not even get a menu or a drink order in all that time. I got up to get menus and was chastised by a waitress who then brought them to the table and left before asking us if we wanted a drink! We left and walked down to Jamisons where we had a great dinner and drinks on the patio.  The food might be good but it is certainly not worth the kind of wait you get here.  I knew their service was sub par from previous experience but this was the straw that broke the camel's back****I love this place! You can order just about anything on the menu and be very satisfied...but good luck deciding.  I was just there for their weekend brunch and although the place was empty the service wasn't so great.  But the food more than made up for it.  Their marguiretas are delicious and the atmosphere is fab."}
{"text":"Ohmygoodness. So delicious. Amazing food. Amazing tequila. Our waitress wasn't the best, but the food was so good I didn't even care.

The ONLY downside to this place is how busy it is."}
{"text":"First off we made reso for 10 people and luckily that number dropped because we would have been sitting on the patio in the cold. This will be our only complaint about the place. It is pretty popular but a small venue. When we got there around 645 the place was packed and stayed that way past our reso. Not sure what they had planned for our group of 10 because it would have never worked. This tells us that they were a little disorganized. 

As for the food we can't complain about that. Food was fresh and very tasty. We find that some mexican restaurants don't care if the food is fresh. For example we have been to 2 other places where the guacamole looks and tastes like the store bought persevered stuff. At Los Chilitos it looks like they made it fresh using real avocados. Small things like that matter when you want to have a good restaurant.

For appy's the group picked flautes, empanadas and Choriqueso. It wasn't spicy at all and one plate easily servers a couple. Price was no more than $10 each. When we finished it seemed like we would only have room for the main dishes and we were right. The apps aren't big but big enough that you won't need much after it. 
For the main dish, I had the Chile Relleno just under $15. Very big dish with a very big poblano pepper filled with ground beef, veggies and bean. So good but so filling. 

Not too impressed about the dessert picks because you only had the choice of two dishes. For a sweet tooth kind of guy like me...I would have liked more variety. It was still good though. 

Anyway we stayed under a reasonable budget even with buying drinks. Per person it was about $34 each. Not bad at all.

So there it is, other then not knowing if they even planned to seat our group inside, it was a good experience.
A must for people to check out and decide for yourselves."}
{"text":"Taste just like eating in Mexico. The Shrimp tacos were amazing and well worth the price. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is incredible. Don't forget taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Had a very good experience here. Next to great. A small quaint restaurant with maybe 12 tables. 
The food was outstanding and the young lady that served us was great.
The only thing I would have liked mote was a bit more variety perhaps... and the only reason I could use more variety was because the food is so good I'd like to come back for more, but to eat something different. Most of the entrees on the menu contain familiars such as quesadilla, burrito, fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, and a few more classic Mexican entrees. 
All in all, great place, really good food and a very traditional feel.
Would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on Chowhound and so far it didn't get any bad reviews so far, so I had to try it out for myself on a rare lunchtime I was actually downtown.

The place is quite nice inside but I'd bet when the weather warms up, the big windows open up to the patio, it'll be much better and livelier.  I hope they get more servers for when it gets busy, there was only one server during the quiet lunch but she managed alright although there were only three tables occupied.  It was a good sign to hear Mexican patrons at the next table.

They have some interesting dishes on the menu and since I'm no expert at Mexican food I couldn't tell if they were some regional dish or just something made up.  But since I've had decent tacos at Mi Tierra and Los Tortillas to compare with I decided to order Chillitos's tacos.  It's three tacos with what ever meat and salsa combo you want for $13.  I had the pastor, chicken and chorizo, with chipotle and pico salsa, (rice and beans were included too).  Overall the tacos were decently flavored but pretty sparse in the fillings, or maybe I was extra hungry....  Salsa's were alright but could have used a bit more spice.  Rice was a little undercooked and slightly crunchy.  Refried beans were very well done and tasty though.

Considering there's very little options right now for good Mexican, Los Chillitos does fit the bill in a busy traffic area for now."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our food; found it to be authentic and tasty! The soup was the BEST I have ever had- including having it several times in Mexico. Staff was very friendly I definitely will go back. The only complaint I have it was hard to read the menu with the dark lighting in the room. (But I did like the darkness after we ordered)"}
{"text":"I created this account just to review this place. The food here was the worst, most bland stuff I had ever eaten. Not only did it taste bad, but it looked like something a dog would eat! I pray, for dogs, if their food tastes as bad as what I had from here! Utterly disgusting!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here with friends, however the service has really gone down hill. I was there in June and had the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant. For the first time in my life I didn't tip the waitress , (yes, it was THAT bad) when she seen the receipt she tore it off the machine, threw it at me & walked away.  I'm a very easy person to please at restaurants , so for me not to tip or write a poor review says a lot . 
I decided to go back last night with friends only to receive mediocre service .. I think we seen the waitress once in the hour & a half that we were there . Not impressed"}
{"text":"I know Los Chilitos has been panned in the past.  \"prices are too high, it's not as good as Mexican food in the US, we don't get free chips and salsa, blah ....blah ..........blah

However, we decided we had to  use our groupon the other day before it expired, and I was dreading it; I had purchased it before reading all the reviews.  What we didn't anticipate was being shockingly surprised.  In a good way.

Our server was very knowledgeable, friendly, professional, efficient and welcoming.  Yeah, sure there was no salsa and chips slammed down in front of you, but we found the servings huge and there was no need for salsa and chips.

I had the Tacos al Pastor.   Luscious, tender pork in a complex chile sauce (so much better than the pastor tacos at Tu Tierra where the chile sauce was extremely harsh and raw tasting and not cooked down properly), accompanied by a tasty cilantro rice and refried beans.  Hubby decided on getting chorizo quesidillas, which were huge and satisfied his hungry-man appetite.  He also had some very fresh pico de gallo, salsas, beans and cilantro rice on the side as well.   Overall, the food was muy delicioso.  What struck me was the depth of flavour in the chorizo (made in house btw), pork,  cilantro rice, beans and  --  you could tell everything was carefully prepared and by someone experienced in Mexican cuisine.

Decor-wise, sure it was  a bit cheesy, but having spent time in many parts of Mexico, it wasn't too far off from places that are actually in Mexico and off the tourist path.    We found the prices slightly high, but what place can you get good food for cheap in Calgary these days unless it's a hot dog stand or something like that?   

We are very picky about food and have travelled extensively in Mexico, trust me this is great food.  For all those nay sayers out there -- oh well, more for us  ."}
{"text":"The 10 loud, drunks next to us deterred us   from even staying to try the food... As delicious as it looked.
Nobody acknowledged us on our way out."}
{"text":"Actually one of the worst experience service wise and food wise I've ever had. The waitress waited over 20 minutes to tell us they don't have 5 of the menu items on the one page 20 menu item list - might want to consider telling people this when they sit down or don't open your doors if you don't have food. Also the food was terrible - my water were all dripping with disgusting waterd down sauce that had no flavour. I can't put in to words how bad this place is. No one was happy everyone hates their food and we would never go back - it's also super over priced for the crappy food and service. SO NOT WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff!! Pretty small place though. Nice tacos but for $14 for 4 tacos is a bit steep..make sure you try all different kinds!! The chicken enchiladas were okay. Asked for the hotter sauce on the topping but it certainly wasn't hot!"}
{"text":"So delicious I love this place. The staff goes above and beyond. Great value for your money!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and flovourful without being overwhelmed by too much heat. They have to work on their seating as it is really uncomfortable. I'll try here again in the summer when the patio is open and better seating is available."}
{"text":"Great food and decent service. Lots of wasps. 

I ate here on the afternoon of 23 August 2015. We were seated quickly and got served very quickly. We hadn't Mexican food for many years because we'd been living in Europe for the last several years, so we were very excited to try this place based on the reviews we'd seen on Yelp. 

I had the tequila prawns and I thought the portion size was very appropriate.  I was pleased that they hadn't gone for a cheap and easy win with this by just making it really salty or spicy to cover poor chef skills. It tasted great and went well with the bed or rice and vegetables it was served on. 

My wife ordered flautas and a glass of jamaica. She enjoyed both, especially the drink (not too sweet, not too tart). My wife finished all of her drink and food, which she doesn't always do. 

The only thing that kept me from giving this 4 stars was the wasp army invasion. I know this is just a Calgary thing and it is not the fault of the restaurant. That said, we had to change tables to avoid being stung (we are both allergic).  Another couple later took our old table, and we saw them panicking as we left because of the wasps. 

So great food, decent service. Worth trying out if you have a hankering for good Mexican food. I think you'll be very pleased with the choice."}
{"text":"love the patio, every summer weekend, beers with some buddies spend hours, usually after dinner then hit home."}
{"text":"Actually I went to the one on 17th ave sw. Good food, awesome patio and their beergarita rocks.
It can be a little pricey. The staffs are amazing (not only in their looks). I love the service.  Great to hang out with friends in the summer."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times and each time the service has been awful. My most recent experience, the waitress overflowed my beergarita and it dropped all the way down the table and onto the floor. Half of my beer was wasted and all she managed to do was say \"looks like you better drink quick\" so that no more of my drink gets wasted. I hadn't even touched it. For $13 a beverage, you'd think they would have had the courtesy to apologize and at least offer to make me a new drink or give me a discount. The server wasn't even apologetic, she just walked away and pretended nothing happened. Very poor attention. There are a number of excellent Mexican restaurants and unfortunately, this is not one of them because of the service. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I know good mexican food. This is not it. 
Ordered the tacos and they were tasteless. Dry and all tasted the same. 
The chicken, chorizo and shredded  beef had more salt in the meat that the Bonneville  salt flats has salt. There was no salsa or guac of any kind to be found with the order. We asked for a little sour cream on the side and were charged extra for a tablespoon sized portion. When asked about it there was only an insincere shrug offered. We live in Mexico seven months of the year. We know good Mexican food and this is not it."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican food. We tried the shrimp tacos and a mole chicken dish. Neither was particularly good. The chicken was dry and the tacos were topped with a supermarket quality thousand island dressing.

On the bright side, the service was good and the place has a nice vibe. Plenty of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great mojitos, and the best fish tacos! There's one waitress there that isn't super welcoming, but all the other girls are great!!! Amazing food, I love coming here."}
{"text":"Saw a top 10 list for tacos out of Los Angeles and this got me in the mood for some authentic Mexican (very hard to find in Calgary) .  Walked down with a colleague a few minutes ahead of noon and got a seat right away...can see the concerns from other reviews  with the size of the dining room but we had no issue.  Ordered the Lunch Taco meal which is 3 tacos and a side of chips with the choice of meats - I picked the shredded chilorio beef, tomatillo chicken and the marinated pork pastor.  Food was served with 3 mystery sauces that were sampled independently ( all were delicious and spicy) Service was prompt and friendly and the food was delicious.  There were a couple of weird things going on, the music was super loud and the transfer area from the kitchen was pretty dirty.  Lunch for 2 was $22.50 with water to drink which is pretty reasonable since a fast food meal is creeping up to $10 bones these days.  No veg options on the menu though, will ask next visit.  Portions were perfect, not too much so no food coma for the afternoon and certainly didn't leave hungry. 

I'd go back which says a lot due to the many eateries available on 17th ave SW.  Food will take you back to most recent trips to Mx.  The next warm spell, I will be a fixture on their patio and will be trying their seafood presentations."}
{"text":"My wife and i visited Los Chilitos on the weekend in the cold \"slushy\" weather, and the warm tequila warmed me up with our quesidilla. The food was great, especially with the cold weather outside. My only \"knock\" on Los Chilitos is that there isn't too much space, but the pail also wasn't available. 

I would love to come back on a hot summer day to give a new rating for this establishment!

-SM"}
{"text":"Legit Mexican (you can tell because it's decently healthy)...good drinks..what else do you need to know? Worth a visit"}
{"text":"The food here is almost decent. It is as close as it gets to Meixcan food by the US standards. It's close. We went with the tacos and ceviche. Both were almost decent. Almost. Decent. Apart from the god awful pricing, the food isn't bad. The tortilla for the tacos is good. Fresh. House made for sho. There are more meats available than just ground beef and chicken, but way short of what's authentic. No cow tongue, skin, or brain. But all they throw on these $3.00 tacos is a portion of cilantro that is just ungenerous as the meat. No cheese, lettuce, good lord, dare I suggest avocado. Nadda else. 

Then more Canadian-ness kicks in. 

Chips and salsa? Oh, there's a charge for that because they \"home make the chips, you see\". The server said that with great pride. Apparently all the other places in the world that give free chips and salsa only use tostitos and old dutch salsa. He pretty much said it that way. You see it in his eyes, such conviction: the other guys? Inauthentic. This place? Super authentic. We're so authentic, we'll ding you for it. Just 'cause..you know?

Then the Ceviche came with a dozen of the chips. There was no way we could eat them with the 12 chips they rationed. Seriously, I got more generous portions in Havana. So we asked for more. They brought them out... at the tail end of our dinner. Whatever, at least they didn't \"forget\". Oh, but when we got our bill we learned that those over-rationed chips were $3.50. Fuck off. I fucking lost it on the server, and he wouldn't relent on this bull shit charge. Out comes the proud manager. I went all Chicagoian on his ass and said I should charge for ketchup and salt at my burger joint if the urine sized cup for ketchup isn't enough for the fries. He didn't relent...it seems that he and this establishment are convicted that the charge is justified. Good lord. I am never coming back here. Mexican food is SUPPOSED TO BE CHEAP. Too bad my date didn't seem to agree with me. There seemed to be some promise with her....

If you want good Mexican, jump on a flight to any US city. For fucks sake, Salt Lake City has better Mexican food than us. If you want more authentic Mexican, hit up the McDonald's drive thru and order their Mexican breakfast burrito.

This place is lucky to get away with two stars. Don't get me started on the pricing and selection in their tequila list...."}
{"text":"One of the best prepared food vendors at the CFM and definitely among the better Mexican choices in town.

I've enjoyed their tamales, tacos (the pibil is fantastic), and I think even once a chile relleno. The only item that I wouldn't eat again was the torta sandwich (a little too heavy with too much bread). The thing, however, that keeps me coming back again, and again, and again is the Huevos Chorizo.

This plate of spicy, creamy, crunchy, eggy goodness will set you back about $10, and it is worth every last penny. It starts with a heaping helping of chiliques: crispy fried tortilla chips topped with tomatillo salsa, crema, and queso fresco. They then add to that a scoop of mildly spiced refried black beans, and cover the whole shebang with an egg/Mexican chorizo scramble. I like to finish it with some ranchero salsa, avocado salsa, some cilantro, and maybe a little more tomatillo sauce.

Grab a cup of horchata if they have it; if not, a tamarind Jarritos or fresh squeezed orange juice from Margarita's next door.

Finish it all off with a great coffee from Fratello/Analog.

Sigh.

Smile."}
{"text":"Nothing is better than sitting on a sunny patio enjoying drinks and great food with friends.

They have quite an extensive menu, from appies (get the salsa, guac and chips!) to classic dishes like tacos, enchiladas and fajitas. 

I went with the breaded basa fish and shrimp tacos (both topped with coleslaw and sauces) and they were delightful! The seafood was nicely battered and crisp, and tortillas were soft and fresh!

You get a great view of 17th on the patio and the upbeat music definitely makes you want to dance! I'm sure after a couple margaritas next time, we won't hesitate to :)"}
{"text":"Try the tortilla soup!! It's the best! The restaurant is charmingly kitchy, nothing fancy, but the food is good. Portions are really big."}
{"text":"We arrived at the Farmers Market and found ourselves to be starving. So we headed off to check out our food choices. The man wanted to try Los Chilitos and after glancing at their menu, I agreed it would be a good choice.

Despite there being maybe 3 people ahead of us in line, the wait seemed significant (over 10 minutes) until the order could be placed. Then there was another 10 minutes of waiting. I get that they are popular but it seemed excessive.

I had the empanada. It was topped with feta, tomatoes and head lettuce with a bit of sour cream sauce. It was tasty and the empanada wasn't too greasy which was nice. It was a little overpriced at $7.95 but  not a bad treat. The man had chicken tacos and while he liked the filling, he said there was a smell to the tortillas that was off putting. He said he has had better elsewhere (maybe not in Calgary, but elsewhere) and he wouldn't try them again. He said his tacos and my meal were $20 which he also felt was a buit much given the food court environment and what we got for it.

I'd like to check them out again to see what else they offer and to see if our experience improves over this first visit."}
{"text":"My favourite place for Mexican brunch so far in Calgary. I'm from CA and it's so hard to find good Mexi Food in Calgary. I don't go for lunch or dinner, but their brunch menu is fabulous to me. I always get the chorizo or huevos rancheros"}
{"text":"Once again I'm so happy I trust the yelpers reviews, and not others from other sites. 
I have been traveling to Calgary back-and-forth from the East Coast to the west side of the country a lot lately. i've had the opportunity to eat at this fine Mexican Cantina more than once and every time it has made my stomach smile. If my taste buds could talk they would be at a loss for words for the flavor and the true authentic taste of any small Mexican town you would come across,if you traveled through Mexico. A great menu at a modest price. A modest selection of good tequilas. Good service not great but good service is all you could ask for from any Cantina. 

This restaurant I will return to over and over again, while I am in Calgary. Small quaint real, what more could anyone ask for.  
So Calgary let's all go and get you some Great Mexican. 
That's the truth and The Real Deal on this Cantina."}
{"text":"The best nachos I've had in Calgary. Not your typical bar/pub crappy nachos either. I think these are SERIOUSLY the best nachos in town and I think about them often.  Which is kinda ridiculous since I should probably be thinking of other things.  Like World Peace, chewing gum while walking, or bullets with butterfly wings.

On the other hand, the margharita drinks were nothing special (and more than a bit over-priced). But the beer (again, nothing special but it pairs well with the eats) and nachos? NO BRAINER."}

Tacos were bland and unappetizing."}

{"text":"I have visited Los Chilitos a few times over the years and have always found the food and drink to be tasty and fresh. Tried the Baja fish tacos last Sunday and was not disappointed. For some reason I always seem to be there in the heat of the evening which \"forces\" me to quaff down large quantities of Sangria. As mentioned on previous posts the nachos are delicious. Great authentic Mexican restaurant in Calgary.

Was a bit less than enthused when some random fish bowl drinking girl tried to sell me her heart shaped pendant for 10 bucks, pitching that it would be a great gift for my dinner companion. Thinking she was 10 shy of her 15 dollar fish bowl.  I did make a quick comment that, now I REALLY feel like I am in Mexico and turned down the offer. That's Stampede and its absolutely free entertainment!"}
{"text":"I've said before that Los Chilitos is a great place for tequila - that's still true (and Mojitos ps), and the patio is great; but I'd stick to Los Chilitos for the drinks and the sun.

Overall, the food was fine, and if you're dang hungry, Los Chilitos can fill you up - but I found it to be a bit overpriced for the quality and slightly lacking in the 'YEAH! That's spicy Mexican food' flavor department.

Like I said, stick to this spot for the drinks, especially if you like tequila. They have a tequila selection that varies from a $5 to a $24 ounce, a good variety of mixed drinks from Mojitos to Margaritas and everything in between.

I'd recommend Los Chilitos for a late-night, a pre-party or an afternoon-in-the-sun drink with friends/family but not for lunch or dinner.

Cheers!

{"text":"Los Chilitos Taco and Tequila House was a nice little find on 17th ave.  It was warm and cozy inside!   I love  guacamole, and I have to say their guac was pretty good!!  

The margaritas were a little dissapointing you could tell that they used the fake lime juice to make them, and I have definitley had better, but they make up for it with their  BEERGARITA! This is something that has to be experienced! 

Overall the food was very traditional Mexican fare that was pretty good!"}
{"text":"The tacos were good, but i prefer less onions and peppers and more lettuce and tomatoes. I like the vibe and the patio, cool place to go"}
{"text":"First... I'm Mexican. 
I know how Mexican delicious food tastes. The Enchiladas I tried here are good. If you come here you should try them. However,  my experience was not good. They didn't have everything in the menu...  Then why would you advertise it?! They didn't have mole de olla,  and ither dishes. Also they didn't have white chicken for enchiladas! That's huge mistake. Commonly enchiladas have white chicken. Also my girlfriend couldn't handle habanero and valentina sauces,  so she asked for green sauce, the one in my enchiladas. They charged for that! This is the first place where they ask money for a sauce. That's so mediocre!  They crave money. The prices are so expensive for an average quality and their kindness is in the floor when they ask money for sauce,  and 15 for three tacos. In Toronto I can get around 5 or 6 tacos for the same price,  with free nachos and many sauces. Here it is a joke! Come here if you want to spend your money for average stuff (average Mexican food in Canada, it is below average in Mexico)."}
{"text":"Jajaja, yo amo Los Chilitos!

What an excellent Taco & Tequila House! I have been dying to visit this place for the longest time! 

My friend and I came on a Thursday evening during \"el happy hour\" and we ordered ourselves a nice refreshing pitcher of sangria and a full plate of delicious nachos with meat. The patio was in full swing, the sun was shining and we just enjoyed the activity along 17th ave. 

Our server was excellent. She was kind, bubbly and came to check on us every so often to see if we needed drink refills or anything else. We had a great time and I can't wait to return soon. 

4 stars from this yelper!"}
{"text":"Quick review.  We popped in for dinner around 7:30. The outdoor seating was hopping, so we sat inside. I ordered the enmoladas (chicken mole enchiladas),  and my wife had the burrito mexicana. Her dish arrived at room temperature, and we sent of back to get nuked. Mine was warm enough to eat, but not hot.  The flavour of the mole was nice - lightly sweet and a bit spicy. The chicken was dry and bland, not even as good as Taco Time. Really. My wife's burrito (after heating) was quite good. Not a huge portion, but okay. We also had Margaritas, and they were decent, if a bit sweet.

Okay food, nothing to write home about. Prices were high for what we got. Still nowhere near as good as anything I've had while visiting the US. I'll hit happy hour on a sunny day and check out the appetizers."}

{"text":"We were heading along 17th on Saturday, August 2 to find a place to eat. We had sushi on our minds due to the sweltering heat. As soon as we saw the two-tiered patio and the inside/outside open walls, we decided to drop in to Los Chillitos instead. Although they were busy, we were seated immediately out on the patio (where we wanted to be) and our server was at the table almost instantly. The offerings on the menu were really difficult to chose from, so many items looked so good! We had very attentive, friendly service for our meal. Which brings us to the food. My partner ordered a pulled chicken quesadilla that was delicious, but the main star in my mind was my dinner (when I was finally able to make a decision!) I ordered the shrimp fajitas. Within about 10 minutes, our food was brought to the table, hot, fresh and sizzling on the fajita grill. The flavours were amazing, the delicious tortillas are made in house, and all of the ingredients were fresh, tasty and well presented. After we left with our satisfied, full tummies, we remarked that it had almost been like an afternoon vacation, before both of us remarking at the same time \"We HAVE to go back there!!!\" Relaxing environment, fantastic service and absolutely astounding food quality/taste. We will be back for sure, and will bring our friends."}
{"text":"Im ecstatic that Los Chilitos is around. Not because of its good location, not because of its decent food and not even for its poor service.
The day I found Los Chilitos was the day I got to give my first 3 star review. 
I used to think 3 star reviews were for a bunch of rag tag hooligan types, the ones who cannot say a bad thing even when they feel the burning passion to. The types that could not give you a compliment if their life depended on it. A group of folks so committed to a life \"o\" mediocrity that they live in the in betweens...a purgatory on earth if you will.

I repent for now I understand a 3 star review.

Los Chilitos has shown me the light...and that light was quite dim.
Kind of like one of those cheap Glade plug in night lights, it was good enough to not stub my toe on my way to the bathroom but far from a light you'd ever get much done by."}
{"text":"Awful. Had a non-authentic margarita and below average Burrito. Charged for an extra side of sour cream and also for the cheese I had requested to be in my burrito as the menu didn't state it had any. The server was Russian and barely spoke English. Over all poor experience, will not go back."}
{"text":"Went here with two friends a couple weeks ago and sat on the patio, facing 17th Avenue S.W.  Pleasant enough but we were sitting at the southeast corner of the patio and every so often we'd get a whiff of garbage, which we surmised must have been coming from the side or back of the restaurant.  But we tolerated it and our lunch made up for the occasional small odor.  We intend on returning but will choose a different location on the patio next time.

I had the Burrito Mexicano, which was really good!  The menu description is as follows:
Grande Flour Tortilla rolled & stuffed with rice & beans and your choice of meat all smothered in red and green salsa & topped with sour cream and pico de gallo. 

Guacamole accompanied this and what great guacamole!  I'm ordering an extra side of it next time so I have lots because it was so tasty.  Also, the portions are a very good size.  I ended up bringing home almost half and like I, my husband was totally impressed with the burrito.  I can't remember what my friends had but I do remember that we all enjoyed our meals so much that we decided then and there that we'd be back soon.

Pleasant service and fun to watch the different vehicles go by.  Can't wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"Yes this is authentic Mexican food, with authentic (if not kitschy) decor. The mole was very nice with the proper amount and types of spice, and the five taco sampler was exactly as I remember from the Nayarit region. This is also one of the few places I have been able to get a cold Negra Modelo.

Space is very tight in the restaurant as it was too cold for the patio, and so you're almost always in a traffic route.  Make sure you get a reservation, and if you can ask for the corner booth or something near the front.

I'll be back to try out the brunch, especially the chilaquiles, also knows as Mexican Kryptonite."}
{"text":"Having just moved here from Atlanta, one of the biggest empty black holes in the food scene is the lack of Mexican. I love Mexican food, so when I heard about this place, I had to try it.

I should also state that my four-star review is based on what else the area has to offer, not necessarily on all the Mexican food I've eaten anywhere. Mexican food is just better the closer one is to Mexico or in communities with a higher Latino population. So, for Calgary Mex, it's a four-star.

I'd compare the menu to that of taquerias in the states. The menu isn't very expansive, but the choices that are there are good ones. We started off with chips and salsa. And they have about six salsas to choose from. I think you get four in the sampler. We got pico, tomatilla, chipotle and one other one I can't remember. They were all very good, as were the chips. My only complaint is that they came served in tiny little dishes. We ran out pretty quick. Of course, one of the biggest problems with Mex in the states is filling up on chips and dips. So maybe this a a good thing.

I ordered the soft taco platter for my entree. They let me mix and match the meats. I ordered one chicken, one steak and one carnitas. They were all very good. Plus, the platter comes with two salsas from the previously mentioned list. All of the meats were very flavorful and the soft corn shells were double-rolled, spot-on.

The margaritas were good too. They have a few different flavors, plus a flavor of the day. You can also get them in three different sizes.

The only downsides are the limited number of choices on the menu and maybe the space itself. It's tiny, which is okay once you're seated. But it fills up fast. It's a little pricey too, for what you get. I'm figuring out that I'm not going to be able to Mex on every corner, so it'll be a little more pricey. Good spot though. I'll be leaning on it heavily to get me through my fixes for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Aye Carumba.
There's nothing like great Mexican when ya' NEED it, is there?
A friend and I decided to hit Los Chilitos a few nights back.
First things first. 
Ever ordered Nachos at a pub, got a plate piled way high, horribly shy on cheese.. and got three little dishes, a la, the pub downstairs in my building, of Guacamole, Salsa, and Sour Cream?
WTF, Dude?
Is it REALLY asking too much for more then a few tablespoons each?
A nightmare when you're sharing with 2 or 3 other people.
I'm here to tell ya', tain't like that at the Ole' L.C.
No way, Amigo.
You get LOADS of chips and HEAPS of gorgeous fresh green Guacamole.
Then we ordered Ceviche.
Fresh and really 'Fishy' tasting. All flavour.
Bloody delightful.
That SHOULD have been ample but, NO.
We're Gluttons. So we decided to Oink On!
I ordered a stuffed pepper and was advised they'd run out.
So, after wiping my teary wee eyes, I ordered the Burritos.

Now, I'm a SAUCE guy and we got sauce. More, more flavours....
She had something yummy covered in Mole Sauce.
I was too busy pounding it all back to notice although we swapped a few bites, if I remember correctly.
And the Beergrita's and the Margaritas and the Coronas, and the terrific service and then? The Bill.
Over a hundred dollars for two with tip, I kid you not.
But the atmosphere was really pleasantly BUZZY-- everybody was enjoying themselves; it's in a little old bungalow on 17th Avenue SW and it was just too damned tough to leave.
Sometimes a simple meal turns into an 'event'.
Hell, I didn't mind the bill one little bit.
I'm going to have to disagree with Mr. 2* on this one.
Was a real pleasure."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever had. I'd eat here every day if I could! Paired with a cold Sol, it doesn't get better. My boyfriend took me here on one of our first dates and I was sold on the tacos AND him for having such amazing taste. Patio is great and so is the inside! I count down the days until I can go back every time!"}
{"text":"It's my third time at Los Chilitos and it's a charm. Parking in the back is adequate and finding a good seat for us two and an infant was good. We started with great Margaritas, a few to choose from, then an appetizer. But the meal I had was the Mole Relleno, not heavy but filling and tasty. Not spicey enough but this meal just needs to be subtle. My Mrs. had the Pastel Azteca, this is a shredded chicken dinner with creamy sauce. I did not mind the taste, but she enjoyed it. The service, atmosphere and music add to a good experience and a Great Evening!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. Amazing salsa,  gauchomole, and hot sauce that's flavourful not just obnoxious. Would  recommend to anybody ever disappointed by skimpy, shifty, reheated pub nachos. These are what nachos should be."}
{"text":"We came here for beerguritas as part of our stampeding adventures. We were walking by when our friend insisted we all stop and that drinks were on him!  Well, twist my arm why dontcha!
The drinks were delicious and easy to put down. I loved that we got chips and salsa, even though we were only there for drinks.  They have a very reasonably sized patio, that's slightly recessed from the street, which is an extra special treat on 17th.
Fun server, who knew his drink menu to rattle off and put up with us needing to hear our beer in margarita options more than once."}
{"text":"Delicious fish tacos! Crispy battered fish with fresh salsa and all the fixins, piled so high you can't actually close the taco, but that's what makes them so awesome. 

black bean & cream cheese-stuffed Jalapenos with honey is a great appy, but it turned out a little different the 2nd time I tried it. Again with a generous amount of filling and a bit of spicy zing, these really pack a punch. 

Soup! YUMM!

If it weren't for a bit of inconsistency with the dishes from my first visit to my second, five stars for sure :)"}
{"text":"I really love it here.

Summer you get to sit on the patio in blazing sunshine watching the people pass on 17th while eating some delightful food. In winter you are in their cozy well decorated restaurant, eating the same delicious food!

Their fish tacos are my go to dish here. All ways fresh and tasty. Never greasy or oily. Light batter on the fish, with just enough topping to fill that delightful corn taco without it all falling out... mostly.

Service is very fast and friendly. Often just one waitress serving on their slower night, but they are all very good at their jobs. Kitchen gets food out as quick as possible and you can tell its fresh - if they are super full, it takes the kitchen a little longer but 100% ok with that for fresh food.

Great choice for breakfast items, although it is so hard to choose something other than the fish tacos. 

You can also order 5 options of tacos individually - so try them all. The pork one is super tasty.

Will I be back? Absolutely, and with friends!"}
{"text":"Eh. The busier they get, the surlier the lady manning the till gets. She's rather pleasant when it's almost closing time, and the market is nearly empty! Love their complimentary salsa bar. Watch out for the chipotle salsa. It's deliciously smoky, but! Nothin' to fuck with. 

No vegan options on the menu, but when they're not busy ( and if you ask nicely), you can get them to put together a veggie taco platter for you :)."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Each and every time I have eaten here the food has been awesome. Quesadillas are my favorite, chicken or pork. If you like homemade salsa, ask for more...so good. 
Service is kind and quick!  A good selection at the bar and they'll make it the way you want!  Dos cervezas por favor!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday dinner a few weeks ago. Ordered calamari to start, which was excellent and then waited a long time for my entrée. Got an assortment of the los chollitos tacos to share with a friend who ordered the fish tacos. The fish tacos were awesome, as were the beef and pork and chicken. You can't go wrong. The only reason I'm giving this place three stars is because it made me hangry waiting forever to finally have my order taken. I understand that our party was a bit chaotic and not everyone was on the same timeline, but there was definitely not enough attention being paid to our table."}
{"text":"We came here for taco Tuesday ($2.50 for 3 types of tacos). Ordered chorizo they were out, ordered tres leches cake they were out and out of salsa as well!! The tacos were mediocre, the pork was dry, the beef was dry, the chicken was bland.. We had to get our server a couple times (to be billed and to ask where our jalapeño poppers were). We wanted to give this place another try because the takeout we ordered was tasteless last time. We ordered enchiladas and fajitas. I remember eating here years ago and it was good which is why we gave it another chance, 3rd times a charm?"}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican fare I've had so far in Calgary. Excellent staff and great ambience lend to it's friendly atmosphere. Ive had the mexicana burrito, and the tortilla soup along with some appies. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't see what the appeal here is.

We come here because it's convenient, and my boyfriend likes it.
I find the staff to be indifferent at best.
On one occasion, we were waiting for a table- we'd already waited 15 minutes at this point- when they took a phone call for a new reservation and then proceeded to tell us that they didn't know how long our wait would be as they had a reservation.
In what world does that bump people that are already waiting for a table?
Not cool. We left.
The food is hit and miss. Sometimes it's good, sometimes not so good.
I often find that the main course comes out before you're done the appetizer.
I always have the feeling they're rushing people through so they can seat the next table.

All in all, it's *ok*. Being that it's on 17th avenue, there's better choices within a few blocks."}
{"text":"Barbacoa tacos are unreal.  I cannot stop thinking about them."}
{"text":"The place is nice inside and it's open air, which is good, and the servers were friendly.  Nothing else was particularly good.

My friend and I paid $7 to share a small amount of chips and guacamole, neither of which were restaurant quality.  They came after we got our main dishes.

I had the burrito mexicano with some dry and tough meat inside.  The rice was a little hard and dry as well.  But at least it had some real spice to it.  The flavour of the sauces was good, but it couldn't fix the problem with the meat and the rice.

It's a little disappointing, because the menu selection (I like the choices of meats for the tacos and burritos) and the decor were good.  If this is authentic Mexican food, then please give me the fake stuff from California."}
{"text":"The food is great here, almost the best Mexican. But the seating is horrible. The seats are high and the tables are low. You have to bend over uncomfortable to eat. I will do take out next time I need to eat from here."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Overall experience: *3/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

*Note: Overall experience was okay... but I recommend you try one of the other higher rated Mexican restaurants in Calgary for better quality food.

My bf and I decided to try this Taco and Tequila house because it was such a gorgeous day and we wanted to sit on the patio. Los Chilitos is a yellow house converted to a restaurant with a \"patio\" on the front deck and a few more picnic tables set up near the sidewalk. I wasn't very impressed by the stained plastic covered picnic tables, but I guess it fits in with the casual laidback atmosphere the restaurant had. I didn't like our waiter very much... he just took our order and scurried away. Instead of removing all the empties on the table at once, he would only take the closest one towards him and run off again. 

They have classic Mexican dishes on their menu including soft tacos (4 for $13.99), quesadillas ($14.99), large burritos ($15.95), enchiladas ($16.50), salsas, and fajitas that come out on sizzle plates ($16.95). Their drink list is limited to tequila based cocktails ($6.95), bottled Mexican beers ($6), Beer cocktails, margaritas, and a variety of tequilas ranging from $6.95 a shot to $8.95+ for premiums. 

We ordered a 'Jalapeno Rellenos' ($8.95) appetizer which was four jalapenos stuffed with beans and a blend of three soft cheeses, coated in almonds & a honey-chipotle sauce. The dish was presented messily and it was really awkward to find an empty pepper - as if someone took a spoon and scooped out all the filling. The jalapenos were soggy and I wasn't sure if it was the honey-chipotle sauce, but the beans tasted a lot like sweet Chinese red bean paste which turned me off. I don't recommend for anyone to get it.

For our \"mains\" we ordered from their Mexican brunch menu (eggs, tortillas, tacos). My bf got the 'Huevos Con Machaca' ($11.95) which included scrambled eggs with shredded beef, refried beans, homemade potatoes, and flour tortillas. The eggs were well seasoned and my bf said it reminded him of what his mom made. The rest of the components were disappointing with soggy tortillas and plain deep fried potato chunks. 

I got the 'Enmoladas' ($13.95) which had four chicken enchiladas covered in their salsa de Mole with a side of rice and greasy homemade fried tortilla chips. They did not skimp on the chicken for the enchiladas and I really enjoyed the authentic taste of the \"corn\" tortillas. It definitely brought me back to my time in Mexico. I haven't had a lot of mole before so I thought the sauce tasted a bit off and one dimensional... or maybe I just don't have an acquired tasted for it.

If you don't want to go into food coma like I did, I suggest sharing a main with someone - there is a lot of food on each plate. I can't comment much on the authenticity of Los Chilitos, but the food quality and price was disappointing. I have a feeling you can find better Mexican in Calgary."}
{"text":"Un lugar realmente mexicano, muy buen servicio, & la comida espectacular. Muy buena ubicación, calidad 100% garantizada. Te hacen sentir que estas en México."}
{"text":"We were starving and drove down 17th till something caught our eye. The bright colours and house-building probably made us stop. O.. and that it said \"Tacos and Tequila\" (I'm easily sold).

Cute place, had a huge patio.. but since we live in Calgary and only get 10 days of sun.. today was not a day the patio was open. 

It had a really cozy feeling inside! I have really mixed reviews and have been trying to figure out if I would go back or not. 

I would go back for the salsas.. they taste soo good. We also had an guacamole appetizer which was really good! Their chips seems to be a little extra crispy here which i liked. 

I wish I had gotten the chicken borrito because it tasted excellent, and so did the chicken tacos.. (if I go back i'm sticking with the chicken). It's really flavourful and not dry. 

The steak on the other hand.. i'll pass.. it made my whole taco experience horrible. I love flavours, and the steak just didnt have it. Oo.. and I was not a big fan of the beans. 

I almost felt as thought I could go to Taco del Mar and get something on par to this... maybe even more flavourful steak. 

Found their menu to be a little limited.. but eh, that might just be me."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place for many reasons, but unfortunately, each time I have visited, it has been a grave disappointment. The first time I visited, my husband and I came for dinner. The prices on the menu are pretty steep, but I assumed that I would receive the value that I was paying. I was wrong. The portion sizes are extremely small, and after paying $20 for tacos, you would think it would be satisfying. After spending over $60 on two dinners and two drinks, we left still hungry and lacking value for the dollars we spent.

I recently gave them another try as a friend was having a birthday pub crawl, and this was one of the stops along the way. Their promotion on their sign was beer-garitas, and since it was a hot day, everyone wanted one. When the server started delivering the drinks, it became clear that the establishment was not ready to supply their Saturday special. Every single person had a Corona beer dumped into a glass with a drop of blended ice floating on top. If you've ever had a beer-garita, it's supposed to be half frozen margarita with a beer pouring into it. Again, after spending another $20, I left feeling extremely dissatisfied and disappointed. I will not be returning here again."}
{"text":"Great friendly service - wow! Food is good. Although they can't cook meat. Avoid anything with meat - it will come overcooked and tough. If it wasn't for that I would've given five stars. Prices are reasonable. Their cocktail menu is super - and their drinks are awesome."}
{"text":"The farmer's market has a unique area that groups several food vendors selling various lip-smacking eats. Finally, the nasty mall food court's hot cousin has come out to the club!

Anyways, lame analogies aside...I checked out Los Chilitos tequira for lunch. for $15 dollars I tried their fish tacos and was served three pieces, each prepared in a different combination of fixings. Even more impressive was that they also had a mini-section of complimentary condiments which consisted of five different salsas!

I would definitely consider coming back to try their other items."}
{"text":"The flavor of the food here is good.  Unfortunately it's cold and over priced and the customer service is non existent.

 I ordered the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. I watched them heat the tortillas and chicken on the grill for a minute or 2. Then put everything together and into the broiler for a minute. The cheese on top wasn't even melted and the meal was hardly like warm. For $16 I'd expect a top notch meal; not a cold meal with not sides like rice or beans. 

The lady taking my order didn't say a word to me except to tell me the cost of my order. No pleasant gestures or thank you for my business.  

There are definitely better Mexican restaurants in Calgary and absolutely better places to eat at The Calgary Farmers Market."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! The atmosphere was the perfect balance of intimate and lively and the staff were incredibly attentive. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Every plate here is authentic mexican food, but at ridiculous 17th ave prices.  All the places in texas/mexico I go to eat authentic mexican, its usually 5$ for 10 plates with mountains of food, and helps to feed the real mexican working man.  This place is some kind of posh hipster joint, while authentic, catering to richie rich upscale crowds who have never left calgary.   Go here for the authentic, or just take a trip down south and live it. probably cost the same."}
{"text":"I adore this place.   After being in Mexico I sure missed the colors and feel of walking the streets of Guadalajara and Chapala.  Returning to snow,  doom and gloom.  I immediately searched for an escape back to Mexico.   This was it.   It was warm and cozy.   Brought me right back.  

I love me a decent taco.   Especially fish tacos.  They are very decent and almost competed with some I had while on a stroll near lake Chapala.  

I have went back a few times.   I am afraid to try anywhere else.  Don't want to be disappointed.  If you want a great patio- they got it."}
{"text":"Sorry, you couldn't pay me enough to go back to this place. Food is okay -but just okay- and over priced for what you get. But the thing that REALLY stands out is the overwhelmingly atrocious service! 
This place does not deserve to stay in business.
Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of actually good restaurants with good service who deserve your patronage."}
{"text":"I went in on Monday, planning to order the fish tacos, lucky me, those were the special for the day. I had ordered take out, so by the time I got back to my room, it was a bit soggy. But flavour wise the tacos tasted really fresh and were delicious. I had also ordered their chips and guacamole,  which was amazing! So fresh! Definitely would recommend the guacamole to anyone who goes there. Would definitely visit again when I'm craving tacos."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from here and thought me and my daughter would give this place another try as our first visit wasn't so great.. Turns out the second visit wasn't much better. 

I will say the patio is what got me to go there.  The service is disorganized and slow. I ordered the nachos with cheese and salsa. Adding guacamole and sour cream is a add on (3.00) and adding meat is 4.00. We also ordered calamari. 

Nachos came before the drinks and were served with all the ads ons ( that I didn't order ). The drinks came and they were great ! Then came the calamari which was deep fried to a crisp. My daughter who loves calamari actually gagged on her first bite. The salt was intense. 

We waited another 20 minutes before a server came back and told her I would like the bill and I would pay for my drinks, she said sorry brought me the bill without the food on it. I don't usually dictate what I'll pay, however I wasn't paying for that food.

Unless I was simply going for the patio I would never chose to eat here."}
{"text":"A group of us went for dinner on Sunday night.
Atmosphere is great on patio but service was terrible. Three of us had to send our good. ack as it was not prepared as required. After which o e of our group was given food so hot:/sipicy it was inedible!  The waitress refused to do anything about it, did. oy offer another dish or discount the food. You should not have to leave hungry on any occasion."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is quite small the service was a little on the slow side (which is the only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars), but the food itself was excellent - barely a crumb was left on any of our plates. 

The appetizer of Flautas was not only particularly crisp and delicious, it satisfied the vegetarian in our group as well. 

I had arguably the best fish tacos I've ever tasted and the two who had sampler platters of the 5 meats loved their meals as well."}
{"text":"We tried los chilitos today and were very pleasantly surprised. We started with the guacamole and chips. The chips are thick and the guacamole was flavorful. For the main course we had beef enchiladas and pastel Azteca. The beef in the enchiladas was very good. It was a shredded beef. The pastel azteca was made with shredded chicken, corn, poblano peppers, onions and cheese. The service was very personable"}
{"text":"I had the taco al pastor, or Shepherd's tacos, which Los Chilitos makes with adobo marinated pork.  As I understand it, the taco al pastor is kind of a Mexican pork version of a shawarma, which was introduced to Mexico in the mid 1900s by the Lebanese.  

Adobo is a marinade originally used to preserve meat and fish.  While it seems to vary region to region, it's basically various chilies, garlic, herbs and vinegar, making it an excellent marinade for pork tacos.  

At about $5, this taco was reasonably priced.  The meat was delicious but it could have used some of the usual taco al pastor toppings like cilantro, onion or even pineapple.  Maybe I was supposed to ask specifically for those, but as pointed out by some other reviewers, the lady working the counter seems like she'd rather be elsewhere.  With friendlier service and a few toppings, this place could get a 5 star rating. I will definitely try again."}
{"text":"Nice rustic decor, good place to come in the summer to sit on the patio or in the restaurant with the overhead doors open.  

Service was friendly, food came quickly but I found the meat to be a bit dry."}
{"text":"Pretty decent mexican fare, the real pull here is the patio and the drinks! I love the mexican bulldogs (also called a beer-garita) where they let you pick both the margarita flavour and the type of beer you want with it- great!

The food is really good, but i find a little high priced. Worth it though to have some authentic tacos el pastor. 

The patio is great great great in the summer- but super busy. During patio season expect to wait an hour for a spot. The servers are usually helpful and will try their best to accommodate- she let us move tables three times one evening in the summer as slowly better tables freed up- even saved us a great patio spot! 

Typical of mexican places in calgary- you do have to flag the server if you want something, but once you get their attention your request is fulfilled in reasonable time.

Really like this place, mostly for the drinks (it is a tequila house after all) but the food is decent too!"}
{"text":"This our go-to Mexican restaurant for ordering in at the office.
Reliable, reasonable, and tasty!
A group of us decided to have a \"Fun Club\" lunch for valentines day today, and so we of course ordered from Los Chilitos.
I swear by the enchiladas. You get just the right amount (3 enchiladas with rice and beans), and there's lots of chicken inside.
The fish tacos looked like a heck of deal - my friend was so full because there was so much fish on each of her 3 tacos!"}
{"text":"Oh dear.... disappointing experience at Los Chillitos. In my experience, Mexican is hard to get wrong, but I had a poor experience recently at this restaurant. 

The Ceviche was bland - and probably more on the questionable side as far as whether I trusted it. I followed up with the fajitas, which had an absolutely dismal amount of chicken on it, which was also bland and quite frankly disappointing. The price was also on the high side, which means that for an area with a lot of great Mexican options, my desire to return here is quite low."}
{"text":"This place continues to be a solid 4 stars. We shared nachos with chorizo, mmmmmm.  I had pastel Azteca which is layered with chicken, cheese?, tortillas, peppers and onions. Topped with some habanero sauce, perfect. Enchiladas at the table had good reviews also."}
{"text":"I often go to the Farmer's Market on the weekends to pick up a few things.  I always like to experiment with the different foods.  The last time I came with my daughter we noticed the man sitting next to us was eating Tacos of some sort.  It looked delicious.  So I decided on my next visit to the Farmers Market I would be trying the tacos at Los Chilitos!  It was a 3 Taco Chilito Sampler topped with onion & cilantro.  Alot of food came on my plate and I barely finished 2 of the 3 tacos.  It was very yummy.  I will definitely eat here again and try their restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Thank god there is a saving grace to the Mexican cuisine of this city in that I just discovered this location on 17th avenue.  It is not much to look at, it is basically just a simple house, and I would have actually missed it if not for the Mexican flag flying overhead.  At closer look I saw it was actually a Mexican restaurant.

One of the best qualities of a Mexican restaurant is that they actually employ Mexican staff, I was able to converse with the waiters here in Spanish and they both assured me that the chef was indeed from Mexico and that the food was as authentic as it can get.

The interior is not too fussy it is rather simple and this is good because sometimes the overtly overdone bad Mexican interiors that I see Calgary having can convince people that indeed it is a Mexican restaurant.  More often than not, it usually is a bad version and even worse Tex Mex food.  Here at Los Chilitos there are no apologies nor any interior hype because thankfully the food basically speaks for itself.

The lunch menu is a nice simple selection of Enchiladas, Gorditas, Sopas and Tacitos.  The food is garnished well; the portions are generous and are all under $12.  Which is expensive compared to eating in Mexico but it is cheap for Calgary and you are getting the real enchilada so to speak.

I was super happy, although they don't serve my favourite mole dish which is chocolate from Oaxaca used as a sauce with usually chicken or enchiladas at least they had enchiladas Verde here which is my second favourite dish.  I am presently teaching a Spanish class to my mother's friends and this will be the restaurant of choice to introduce them to authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at this place, great location and a taste of Mexico right on 17th Ave."}
{"text":"Ordered their Nachos with and without meat. 

Their nachos were unique, there was a fair amount of cheese and meat on the meat option.  What I liked is that you could add more toppings to the Nachos going as spicy as you want.  

I personally preferred the Nachos without the meat, and should have added more toppings."}
{"text":"Very decent Mexican restaurant. My wife and I are from Mexico and found the food to be pretty good. We ordered a variety of tacos and thought the cochinita (pulled pork) and carne asada (steak) to be the best ones. The drinks are good too. I had a michelada diabla, which is close to a caesar, but with beer (instead of vodka) and a little spicier (good for hangovers). Definitely recommend to anyone looking for good Mexican food, usually not easy to find in Canada."}
{"text":"Show me the party! This place is fantastic! I love mexican and this place does it great! I adore that they serve Beergahritas, they are even on special on Saturdays! The food here s delicious and very reasonably priced! The service was average, which is the only thing stopping this from being a 5 star review. I actually thought about marking it down to 3 stars because our server incorrectly added our bill and basically asked for more money.... which means she ended up getting a huge tip. Irritating to say the least. The patio saves this place, it's always a good time, just double check your servers math."}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars. Service - 2 stars.

I was famished by the time we got to the farmers market last weekend. A quick pass by of the food court had me deciding I had a hankering for some Mexican food so I stopped in front of Los Chilitos and ordered myself a quesadilla. It was tasty and full of chicken and cheese. The girl taking my order, well, she was halfway through her own meal and probably hungry herself. She wasn't unpleasant but I think she would've rather been elsewhere.

The stand in the front confuses me a bit as well. More like, a section of the front counter comes in and out and one of the employees kept pulling it out and then back into place. Twas a little strange!

At any rate, definitely pop in for some food if you're hungry, but maybe wait until any teens behind the counter are on their break."}
{"text":"Los Chilitos is cute. It's a touristy looking Mexican joint, inside a bright yellow building the size of a house on 17th Ave. I've always envied the patio, but haven't yet had occasion to sit on it.

I stopped in on Wednesday night for some late night enchiladas and drinks with Tara M. The drinks... fab! Mojitos were on special, I couldn't help but have three of them. And they each had a delightful sprig of some kind of herb (I'm so bad about knowing which herb is which.. I think it may have been mint?) that added just that much more refreshment to the drink.

The enchildada dish we split was, just as the three star rating suggests, a-ok. In fact, it was pretty good. I'd eat it again. Our server was great, attentive and friendly. 

So why only three stars? Well, as a dinner destination, I think the experience is easily replicated. Now an afternoon with some tequila on the patio on the other hand... well, stay tuned. I'm looking forward to that experience sometime before the blistery cold of winter hits."}
{"text":"BEST. MEXICAN. IN. CALGARY. 
It's a converted house. Super cute, and SUPER SMALL! Be prepared to wait. Even with reservations we waited for 15 minutes to be seated. Once inside we waited and waited to order drinks, then waited and waited and waited to order food...then waited some more before it came. But the food is worth it! Definately on the high side in terms of price, but delicious hand made Mexican food is worth it! It's NOT greasy and not too spicy or bland. I would say it's perfect. The ONLY time I've ever had better Mexican food was at a little cantina run by a Mexican Grandma in Osaka Japan! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First, \"JS,\" Calgary gets something like 200 days of \"sunshine\" per year. One of the sunniest cities in Canada. And even in this wet cold summer we've been having, Los Chillitos; patio has been open since May. In a year with a normal summer they'll get close to five months' use out  of it- great patio.

The food is superb, close to the best REAL Mex I've had in Canada (best is at Las Tortillas by Marlborough Mall). I always get the carnitas tacos- Los Chillitos absolutely knows how to do pork! Don't bother with the beef, which is the coward's choice for tacos anyway. Pork ro chicken, or fish when they have it. 

The beans are absolutely amazing- that authentic, almost soupy refried  bean puree that you get in real taquerias all over the US. Best refritos I've had in this country."}
{"text":"The drinks are okay, not a ton of margarita selections. This place appears to focus on more of Spaniard cuisine as apposed to the typical Mexican.. 

The seating was good on the patio. Friendly service, a little on the slower side. The single bathroom that they have for the whole restaurant is dated and gross to be honest.

I am on the fence about whether or not I would return here... There are cleaner places with quicker service and better tasting food. The patio and margarita's would be the only enticing part of this place."}

Overall the only thing I really enjoyed was the Patio, but I have heard friends state they love this place, it just wasn't up my alley."}
{"text":"Review: lunch.

It's been a while since I've visited the Calgary farmers market so it was about time to venture out and see the locals' latest offerings.

Food: I ordered the enchiladas with chicken and I've got to say, it's got a very good flavor profile. The chicken was well seasoned and the fried beans were phenomenal. I usually don't like beans but I definitely would make an exception here. The only downside to the dish was the sogginess of the wraps. It kind of threw me off.

Value: reasonable price for the food. Food court food tends to be more expensive at the Calgary farmers market than other food courts. Portions were okay."}
{"text":"My sister my son and I went here a couple fridays ago! oh boy what a dissapointment! not only was the customer service awful the food was even worse!! It was our first time there so we ordered 2 dishes to share al pastor tacos and chicken enchiladas both had no flavour! the enchiladas where swimming in salsa verde and sour cream, the tacos where dry, flavourless and didn't come with any garnashmemts. My son had one bite of his cheese quesadilla and couldn't take another. I have been to mexico i've tried authentic mexican food and this doesn't come close! if you want to try good authentic mexican tacos go to the farmers market on 17 ave se the little booth called molcajete sells the best tacos in calgary!"}
{"text":"I SOOOOOOOOOOO wanted to put a \"wicked\" review on here. We went again just to be sure. (insert failure buzzer here).

For whatever reason, maybe my tastebuds have died, but the food has gotten a little careless and bland. 

Service was really great before -  now not so much. It wasn't so bad that I wouldn't go back, but I'm going to put a pretty decent amount of space between me and Los Chilitos for a while."}
{"text":"The nachos here are awesome! They are a bargain for $10 but I added barbacoa beef to them for an additional cost.  Lots of white cheese, pico, guacamole, and a crema drizzle. The chips are handmade and sturdy enough to hold up to the toppings. They also had a free salsa bar- I enjoyed the tomatillo salsa and the avocado crema.  It also had lime wedges, diced onions and cilantro in case you wanted to add more. 
Enjoyed a bottled Mexican coke with my lunch."}
{"text":"Really phenomenal chicken tostatas! Went with a few friends for happy hour- apps are half off, $2 off beer- and being a Tuesday it was $5 margaritas. I will definitely return for the food, however not for the service. Our waitress in particular was lost, confused, absent, and generally no good- I would have given them more stars if not for the service, such a shame."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town! Authentic tacos, enchiladas, and chile relleno. Margaritas are delicious and well priced. There's a special drink or menu item every day. And seriously one of the best patios in town. It's definitely a regular spot for us. Overall, excellent quality food for good prices!"}
{"text":"This is the best and most authentic Mexican food I've had in Calgary.

My friend Toni has been raving about this place to me for a while (read her 5-star review) and on a nice, hot, sunny Friday afternoon we hit up their patio. I started with a michelada. They make a fantastic michelada. It's probably the spiciest one I've had and they use the correct rimmer to crown the drink. After my spicy beer drink was done, my friend and I split a pitcher of sangria. The pitcher was a great refreshing drink to sip on the patio in the afternoon sun.

To go along with our drinks we had an order of chips and guac. The chips were lightly salted and the guac was nice and chunky. I like a chunky guac so you can actually tell what's in it and enjoy the individual flavours. I always cringe at a place that serves you a smooth green paste and calls it guac. Nothing suspect about the guac here, it was very flavourful and hit the spot.

For my meal I went with the Al Pastor tacos. They were bang on. The pork was nice and tender, full of flavour, and just the right amount of pineapple. They has a few salsas on the table to try. While I'm not sure which was which, all three brought their own unique aspect to the dish. The four tacos were packed full and were a great portion size for the price.

To cap off the afternoon my friend and I each had a mojito. Again, a well made drink. The mint was fresh and there was no hint of wilting. This one didn't last long on the table before I sipped it down.

Despite the place being packed and a line forming on the sidewalk, the service was great. Our server came by often enough to check on us, but wasn't overly intrusive. The drinks were kept flowing and our food came at a good pace. Great job overall."}
{"text":"Had a great day on the Patio for cinco de mayo. Have beergaritas. The service was great and so was the food   The staff is amazing and does such a great job with service. Best patio on 17th. Always"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars in the summer because it's walking distance and just so good. I love that it's in an old house. It feels authentically Mexican inside. Everything that I've tried on the menu has been delicious but I really love their huevos rancheros. Pair it with one of their huge fishbowl margaritas and you've got a good start to the day :)"}
{"text":"Never been to the Calgary farmers market before. Decided to try Los Chilitos as I am a sucker for tacos. Got the platter. The chorizo taco was ok, but the fish taco was great."}
{"text":"Cold beer and great tacos. Best nachos in the city. Added bonus, the margaritas aren't neon green!"}
