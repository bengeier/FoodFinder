{"text":"European atmosphere with great coffee and handmade food for all times of the day. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be something.  As far as I am aware, it's the only non-Tim Horton's coffee shop south of Bloor in this line of longitude.    But it currently seems like it's still learning the ropes.  Menu is impressive, but the actual food looks just so-so.  Staff seem a bit amateur.    All I had so far was a latte, but it was more along the lines of a sweet, warm milk.  Atmosphere is very cool.  Great patio.    Let's hope it turns into something great!"}
{"text":"Walked in and LOVED it. Atmosphere, decor, food options (both sweet and savoury), drinks... I pleasantly welcome it all. We definitely need more development in the area for the many many residents and I hope this cafe picks up business! We need more not less of this here!  Today I had the Caribbean chicken sandwich with a side of fruits and hot chocolate - yumm"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor but the food was only average. The Ceasar salad had leaves that were turning pink and the fruit bowl was unpalatable because the fruit was old. The girl at the register was slightly unpleasant."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere. Fresh food. Illy coffee. Desserts, pizzas, quesadillas, salads, wraps... everything looks delicious! I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Great Place with a nice atmosphere.  I've tried their expresso and coffee and both did me right on both occasions. Great location, especially for residents like myself who live in the same condo complex as this Cafe. Hopefully this place starts picking up soon, it's never really busy every time I go there. All-in-all a decent place for some good warm coffee."}
{"text":"Great little cafe/bistro just around the corner from home for me. It's sort of difficult to access if you're in a car so ensure you're driving through the large condo driveway entrance to the North of Avenue Cafe (if traveling north bound).  Avenue has mostly typical cafe beverage options in terms of coffee's, late's, espressos, and teas. They do some specialty and seasonal picks as well which were very tasty. but I tend to be a creature of habit so I stick to what I like and save my calories for other things.  Other things like their bistro style menu! This is where this place sets itself apart, the food here is good - all of it. Perfect lunch or easy dinner options ranging from soups and salads to sandwiches and hot meals. They even have G-FREE and Vegan options for those hard pressed to find those options. I suggest trying the Caribbean/jerk sandwich/wrap - divine.   In warmer months their patio is excellent, lots of tables, huge umbrellas and the WiFi works great outside. The WiFI is also free so this is a great place to get work done.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Meh.  It's nice to have a cute-looking joint in the area, but I wasn't impressed by the food. Looked good, but the rubbery salmon salad turned me away from returning."}
{"text":"A really convenient spot to grab coffee or a quick bite. Also offer smoothies, which always taste amazing. Their hot beverages also are customizable and the staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"Better coffee and way better food than Starbucks...hoping these guys do not take a hit w two new Starbucks in the area. They need to warm up the space though. Looks too severe, minimalist and not welcoming. They could also benefit from having some community events to bring neighbours together. Also insulate better from ongoing construction..."}
{"text":"My favourite café in the neighbourhood! It is conveniently located, just a short 10 minute drive from Humber College lakeshore campus, or 20 mins by the streetcar.   The modern design of marble, silver accents, suspended lighting and a feature wall of mirrors make this a beautiful space for a work occasion or casual meet up.   Their outdoor parking spaces near the back entrance are limited, so they have secured retail parking in the nearby condo underground parking. Use the intercom to access \"retail parking for avenue cafe\" and the concierge will let you in.   My favourite orders are the bagel with lox, chicken pesto pasta salad, mix green salad, and chicken mango sandwich.  I'm also a huge fan of their iced matcha latte and caramel cappuccinos!"}
{"text":"Good coffee and nice place. Local spot. Never full though and my worry is it will go out of business soon if people don't start stopping by. Great patio for the summer!  Beats Tim hortons."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot for coffee and a meal! High ceilings and fresh and thoughtful food and I have just moved into the neighborhood and think it is a gem of a place."}
{"text":"Avenue Cafe and Bistro is a great place to catch up with a friend or client for a coffee or small lunch. I usually meet clients there or have meetings with coworkers. It is a beautifully designed space with plenty of seating.   I typically get one of their sandwiches and a drink when I'm there and it comes to around $12-$15. They serve Illy coffee which is good but I'm still partial to the coffee at Birds and Beans down the road for espresso based drinks.  They have a great big patio also in the summer and plenty of free parking downstairs.  For a small cafe they do a great job!"}
{"text":"I have grown to like this modern café located on Parklawn between Lakeshore and Queensway. Aside from some difficulty parking at times, the café has come a long way in terms of food quality and service since the first time I was there. The interior is bright white with some black and white images filling a tall wall behind the front counter. The space is very bright and airy with a high ceiling and about 15 tables inside, a community table and a very large patio. There is a lot construction on the area however it has never been a problem on the weekend.  The food selection consists of some pre-made and made to order sandwiches soups and some pastries. On my last visit I had the Avenue Western Sandwich and it was probably the best western sandwich I've ever had. The eggs were fluffy with pepper, ham and onions and the multi-grain bread was fresh and nicely toasted. The sandwiches are big so you could easily share one for breakfast. You place and order at the counter for food, order beverages and pay for your order at the other end of the counter. They give you a number and bring food out to your table.  They have a nice selection of beverages and while I am not totally certain if they have mugs (since every time I've gotten a latte it has been in a paper cup) it would be nice to have a latte in a nice mug. That would be my only suggestion for the staff when people are ordering food and beverages to stay. I have also had breakfast at Eden in the area and for a casual breakfast with great sandwiches and eggs, I much prefer Avenue. You don't have the nice view of the lake as you do at Eden, but the food service and pricing are much better at Avenue."}
{"text":"Over the weekend was here for bf, unfortunately it was not quite as good as their sandwiches, snacks and coffee.  Limited bf menu, too simplistic for my taste.  Error with my order did not help, which was rectified pronto.  Still a good place though, will be coming here again"}
{"text":"Decent little café, but nothing special. There is a pretty extensive menu of sandwiches, salads, baked goods and drinks, good lunch options.  I ordered a roast beef pressed sandwich with a side caesar salad. Both items were pretty average. The roast beef sandwich was served on a whole wheat baguette, the crust of which got rather hard as the sandwich cooled. It would probably have been better served on a softer bun.   They have free wifi, and a large patio. Sadly, with all of the construction going on around this place, it's extremely noisy and dusty sitting outside.   Would probably come back again just because it's close to home, and beats out the Tim's and Starbucks up the street."}
{"text":"Love love this place clean, great food , great service, reasonable price , deserves 5 star !!!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this cafe on my Sunny Saturday walk with the man.  Ordered a coffee and cappuccino.  Drinks were great but the dirtiness of the cafe was a turnoff.  Floors were filthy, tables not cleaned and a bit of a mess of table and chair placement.  The majority of staff were hiding and chatting in the back when they should have been cleaning up the mess.  Maybe warmer weather will wake up this place."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Awesome staff, friendly, caring, and helpful! The food is amazing, too! Quick order, getting my food, eating, being satisfying, Boom!! But it WAS! I used to come every 3-4 days for the sandwich, coffee, snacks, etc! Loved it! I am pretty sure they changed the chef and staff (or maybe owner) because everything there has changed (in a bad way) so sad!!! It's total like some one stole your favourite toy and destroyed it!! I went there in April, and ordered sandwich and salad, tasted so bad! It took them 20min to prepare the sandwich (before was 10mins max). The sandwich was warm outside and cold (soo cold)  inside! I thought it was just my unlucky day! So I tried again this month, early May! I ordered coffee, and stood aside and waiting, the lady seemed forget my order! After 5mins, I asked her if my coffee was ready, because I didn't see anyone working around the coffee machine! She finally started to make the coffee, and asked me what my order was! Was that because it's busy there? No! It's just me!! Nobody else! // The same day I went there for a wrap (lazy day, didn't wanna cook), the same thing happened: warm wrap, cold inside, plus 20mins waiting time! ! Today I went there AGAIN, because I am sick, just wanna have a coffee and yogurt parfait. I ordered, a different lady forgot my order again! And she was busy counting receipts, and she kept asking herself \"what I am doing!?\", I wanted to ask her, too. \"What are you doing!? I'm standing here like forever and you haven't brought my Yogurt yet, and my coffee machine is still very silent!..... // after all these bad experiences happening in one-two months, I won't be back I think... I would rather go to the Metro besides and get a sandwich there, at least it's warm, and nobody wanna forget my order... Sigh! I used to love this place, so did lots of other customers ....."}
