{"text":"Wow!!  Blown Away and highly reccomended! Stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered the Bohn Mi pork sandwich. It was delicious with so many layers of flavor and texture
 The service was equally gracious and attentive! I highly reccomend you stop here."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for dinner last night. The food was incredibly disappointing and not worth the price we paid. Overall, a great concept with poor execution. We got the wings to start with and the cajun salmon and short rib pot roast for our main dishes but the server misheard my husband and brought the short rib tacos, which we sent back to the kitchen because after trying the rubbery, cold wings that were supposed to be \"twice cooked\" as stated on the menu description, we knew the rest of the food was going to be subpar. My blackened salmon was overblackened and underseasoned - the middle portion was the only edible part. Despite the screwed-up order, the two stars are for our waitress who was friendly, attentive and very apologetic. However, we will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Completely underwhelmed with this experience. Went for lunch, had better service from the busser than our server, who was taking care of two other tables in the otherwise empty restaurant. Food was not worth the prices by a long shot, $15 for mac and cheese that was under seasoned. 
The entire place is also carrying a heavy chemical smell from their recent reno, which in time will no doubt fade, but currently didn't help with the experience. Those who are sensitive to odors might want to think twice if the rest of the review didn't already change your mind.
We will not be returning, and without some serious changes to their business plan, I doubt they will be around for long."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch today and even though i have had many good meals there it was not one of those times..
$28 for five scallops under cooked, semi raw risotto missing the \"peas\" stated in the menu that was way too salty, and the unevenly cooked broccoli..
I might try again; yet today was not remotely the incentive needed to do so.."}
{"text":"Decent food but so so service.  I've heard mixed reviews so decent to try for myself with 2 friends on Friday night. Arrived around 6:30 and when ready to order were told a few things on the menu were sold out for the night. These were regular menu items, not specials.  Table shared house salad, tacos, and seafood Mac n cheese. All good. Nothing extra special. Bartender had to bring our drinks, our waiter seemed to be spread thin with too many tables.  It's in the neighborhood so I'll prob give it another shot."}
{"text":"Stopped by early on a Saturday night to see what the whole \"modern comfort food\" thing was about. I ordered the \"land\" mac and cheese, which had chicken, chunks of meatballs and some short rib mixed in. It was delicious! The cheese sauce was outstanding, the \"sriracha\" topping added just a little spice, and the meat was really good. The portions were very big - I ate the 2nd half for lunch the next day. The side salad was good (and not boring at all) and the dessert was excellent.

The service was very friendly and I liked the \"modern\" decor. The cocktails were good. The beer and wine lists are a little limited (honestly, so is the menu) but the selection was enough that we could find something. They do have a small kids menu and they are on NoWait so you can always get a table. Other reviews mentioned that the menu was a bit pricey - I'd probably agree with that.

The place was finally full around 630pm on a Saturday. Parking in Regent Square can be tricky - parking on a side street is recommended. Overall, a place I'd go again."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out the new place in town! Started with the wedge salad and it was very good- for dinner had the stuffed meatloaf- loved it, and the Brussel sprouts were delicious. The glaze on the meatloaf was different and yummy. My friend had the seafood Mac and cheese with lots of lump crab and shrimp in! If you like old bay, this is the way to go. 

Really impressed with this place for the first go around! I will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Modern atmosphere.  Had  pulled babrbecue pork with candied jalepenas and tater tots Potene. Wife had meatloaf sandwich and French onion soup. Excellent food.  Only 5 tapa but all good Craft beers.  Dominique was our bartender and was fantastic.  Also great selection of wines by the glass.

First MondYs they have various tastings & Parings. Monday is a bourbon tasting."}
{"text":"Pros: 
-the hostess was so kind and welcoming, she left a really good impression
-the food was great, mac'n cheese, shrimp scampi & roasted chicken.
-waiter was nice enough and seemed to know the menu well.
-very modern decor (if you like that thing & I do)
-great drink/wine selection (but not beer)

Cons:
-too pricey for the neighborhood
-limited beer choices (only 4-5 on tap)
-dessert menu was just weird

We will definitely go back, but probably not often."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, server was attentive but this had to be the smallest salad ever. Two of us ordered the wedge with hard boiled egg and bacon. There were literally tiny \"crumbs\" of egg and the bacon was literally no where to be found. There was no wedge, more like 3 little leaves. The salads were a joke."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went on a Friday night, 7pm, moderately busy.  I ordered a peach sangria and hubby a Moscow Mule, both were pricey, but you could actually feel the alcohol.  We both ordered salads--kale Caesar and a wedge, delish!  For our entrees I had the cedar plank salmon, which was perfectly cooked and hubby had the ahi tuna, he loved it!  Love the new atmosphere, we will be back to try some of the other creative entrees soon,"}
{"text":"Ease has become one of our favorite places once or twice per week! Great burgers, different types of mac n cheese, and delicious salads that are presented with pizazz.  Specials, music, and clean silverware every time.  Last but not least, the staff are the tops - they remember you."}
{"text":"How do they justify charging $20+ for a mediocre piece of meatloaf with mash and brussels? Its like they know its not great so they put on those fried, breaded onions on to make up for the lack of flavor. How do you take the finest, fattiest, tastiest piece of beef (the short rib) and make it tough? A short rib shouldn't need a knife. It seems like a complete lack of care. Why put roasted potatoes on top of mashed potatoes? Just confusing. Also, more fried onions on the short rib?"}
{"text":"Food: The American Bohm Mi sandwich is wonderful! The sweet potato fries were crispy and hot. 
Price: Pricey for lunch, but the ingredients were fresh and the meal was crafted. 
Decor: Beautiful and comfy! I like the color the floors are stained. Nice job!
Service: The server was very attentive. 

Overall: I will be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing Mother's Day brunch.

When we checked in for our reservations, the host gathered a lovely bouquet of carnations from a bucket behind him, handed them to me, and said, \"Pick one.\" 

Tacky? Yes. Cheap? Yes. But an excellent indicator of the brunch to come.

I enjoy Ease's Sunday brunch and was delighted to be taken there for Mother's Day. Because of the special occasion, brunch was a buffet rather than the normal sit-down affair, but we all assumed it would reflect the high standards and creativity typical for Ease.

Nope. What we got would be a pretty typical mid-priced hotel chain breakfast buffet - but at the high price of $25 per person (not including coffee). Hot dishes were presented in steam trays, so the waffles and hash browns were limp; the scrambled eggs, salmon, and chicken marsala were overcooked; and the veggie frittata was rubbery. The eggs benedict (usually my favorite thing on the brunch menu) featured under-cooked poached eggs (clear, runny whites - eew!) and paper-thin Canadian bacon. Only the sausage (house made) and bacon were respectable. 

The cold foods included shrimp cocktail (decent, but clearly pre-processed shrimp), a very generic fruit salad (pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, grapes), and a small lettuce salad bar.

The pastry table featured croissants and danish that suspiciously resembled the ones I buy at the local grocery, as well as a plate of cookies and small cake squares.

Service was insufficient for the crowd, unable to keep the coffee cup filled, and defensive of the mediocre food. When I decided to go back to the buffet in a vain attempt to find a fully-cooked eggs benedict, the server told me to re-use my dirty plate!

Next year we'll stay home."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The food was amazing and the service was excellent. We had a fabulous seat by the huge window which brightened up the experience. The crab cake, the hanger steak, and finally the ice cream sandwich were delicious! This place is perfect for a casual night out for a date or with the family. We're definitely going back."}
{"text":"Not anything good to say. We are local to Regent Square. We have waited patiently for a new family friendly, welcoming spot to meet all our friends and enjoy a great dining experience... still waiting.
The decor has the ambiance of meat locker and the food felt rushed and the ingredients thrown together.
The bar area literally made my head hurt, as I could smell the fumes from the exterior varnish used on the new woodwork. 
Not sure what demographic this was intended for, but obviously hungry, down to earth locals were left out."}
{"text":"1/24/18: Gave Ease another try as it's a neighborhood business and I am glad I did. The menu has been expanded and the prices are much more reasonable. There seems to be something on the dinner menu to appeal to everyone in both taste and price. The wine and beer list are adequate enough. The cocktails still seem to be missing something. Overall, I definitely recommend this place for dinner. They have certainly listened to their customers and adjusted. 

Nice addition to the Regent Square area but a few kinks to work out. I went with my husband and some friends on a Friday night to check it out. Nothing like this in the area so jazzed to have it. The macaroni dishes were delish! We had regular Mac and cheese, veggie Mac and cheese and seafood Mac and cheese. The gourmet tuna casserole was good as well, but not worth the price. The drinks were pretty good but a Manhattan on the rocks!?! Didn't ask for the rocks. First round of drinks were yummy! Salads were great too! Wasn't expecting bacon in the Brussels sprout side- especially the vegetarians in the group. Disappointing- should offer a bacon-free version. Sadly, the salmon wasn't cooked appropriately- raw in the middle, certainly not medium or medium well. 

The remodel looks great except for the lighting. Love the large light fixtures but the lighting was harsh! The other lights had warm bulbs- I recommend warmer bulbs in the large fixtures. 

Will definitely give it another try. Great place if you're craving mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and never had any issues, with food or service. In fact, I've always found it to be a relaxed neighborhood spot. Their burgers are great, definitely recommend going burger night- price starts at $5 with add ons for additional cost. Done the way requested, with good flavor, nice crust on the outside and juicy on the inside. I love their house salad and dressings, always fresh. The original mac and the seafood mac n' cheeses were both very delicious, creamy and rich as you'd expect them to be. Seafood mac includes shrimp, lobster, and crab, with enough portions of them to satisfy (not stingy). The reuben sandwich, was one of the best reubens I have ever had. The house made pastrami caught my eye, and with the buttered marble rye, and caramelized onions, it made for an amazing sandwich. As for the space itself, it is large, which doesn't seem so from the outside. That  can be rather difficult to give off a cozy feel, but every time I've gone, which is usually in the evenings, it's been busy with patrons. The staff wear black, always have since I've been going, so they are identifiable. I've found them to be attentive and pleasant, not over bearing. The bar area has TVs and can accommodate a lot of people, as there's high top tables and chairs in addition to the actual bar chairs. There's also several out door tables and chairs for when the weather allows. All in all, no complaints here."}
{"text":"I stopped in with some friends today. We have been trying all the restaurants in the Regent Square area and, sadly, I have to say that ease is my least favorite so far. I had the wings and they were so rubbery I couldn't eat them. My friends had the bohm mi sandwich and fries. It was over priced and over powered by the taste of allspice. For what they charge, you would think they could at least serve fresh cut fries, not frozen ones! The decor is empty and cold and has a cafeteria feel to it. Unfortunately, we will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"My family went last night as a group of eight. They made sure to seat us timely, and even checked if any table was lopsided before seating us. We all took note at how everyone there genuinely cared about our experience. Rather than typical rolls to start, they serve warm homemade biscuits with a blueberry lemon butter. Normally, I am not a blueberry fan; however, this combination complimented each other beautifully. For my meal I ordered the chicken and dumplings with a side of charred brussel sprouts. My entree was not at all what I expected, but in the best way possible. Rather than a think gravy, the chicken was tender, and the sauce was light and flavorful. The dumplings were handmade gnocchi. Each bite enticed me to want more."}
{"text":"So good!!! I'm not easily pleased most times at restaurants but I really loved this place. Food was awesome especially the wings and seafood Mac and cheese. We sat at the bar and the bar tender was super attentive and friendly. The decor is cute too. Lastly get the ice cream sandwich for dessert..you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have been here a couple of times and the food and the service are both really good. Today, I had the kale and roasted brussel salad and the turkey Devonshire. Both were delicious. The draft and wine selection are good. Prices are good for the amount of food and the quality. I recommend!"}
{"text":"5 stars for our bartender, 3 stars for food and ambiance. While an upgrade for sure, with a better vibe and food and wine list, there are still a few kinks to be worked out. The bartender however was fabulous- professional, friendly, and attentive!"}
{"text":"Since my husband and I live just down the street and prefer to patronize neighborhood businesses, we've tried Ease twice since it opened. Both times we've found the service slow and spotty (even though the restaurant was not busy), the food mediocre at best and very overpriced for size/quantity (I.e. $7 hanger steak add on to a salad that was 5 small charred pieces), the mixed drinks are clearly from generic mixes. I called to complain tonight and was first told I should call back Saturday as there was no manager on duty. After I asked to speak to the chef, she offered me \"a discount at a later date\" if I came back in, but why waste my time and money that way? There are far too many good restaurants in the East End to ever bother with Ease again."}
{"text":"The food here is great.  I've been several times and I've yet to have a meal that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.  Nice atmosphere but dining room is a little big.  Staff are friendly and they have a nice list of beers and cocktails. I would definitely recommend if you're in Regent Square and want to eat a nice dinner out!

They also have brunch but I haven't had a chance to try it."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place, especially since I live in the neighborhood. Here's my impression:

Decor: pretty sterile and unwelcoming. Nothing cozy or intimate about this space, harsh light and monochromatic (gray) color scheme. Lots of seating, but the place was near empty. None of this would have really mattered to me had the rest of the experience been good, but it wasn't unfortunately.

Service: totally fine. No complaints.

Price: pretty steep prices for a neighborhood restaurant that serves mac and cheese. Seriously, $15+ for standard mac and cheese was about $6 overpriced. 

Food: French onion soup was watery and totally bland. Onions weren't even caramelized. Disappointing and pricey at $5+ for a small bowl. I got the veggie mac and cheese and my partner got the land mac and cheese (strange assortment of meats added to the mac and cheese, kind of weird and just didn't work). Both dishes were not fresh, and seemed assembled with ingredients that had been prepared well in advance. Flavor was just meh. The worst part was later when both my partner and I were competing for the bathroom at home. Totally not acceptable.

Overall: I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Stuffed French toast is amazing. Eggs Benedict was also very good - a little more flavor in this would have made it a 5 star experience.  Service was quick and friendly. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is ny far one of the friendliest places in the east end. I meet both old friends and new friends here. The staff is amazing. They will go out of their way to make your experience a great one. The Tuesday burger deal is amazing and they also have jazz nights which are very cool. Everything I've tried on the menu has been great. I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of going here because I loved Dunnings (the place that was there before Ease). The menu is pricy but the lunch menu is reasonable. I went with a friend and we ordered the shrimp tacos ($9) and the crab cake salad ($16). Both were really good. I actually loved the pickled onions on the salad. The wait staff was super friendly. Especially since we came at 11:15 and apparently they do not open until 11:30 during the week! I would definitely go back again. I want to try their different mac n cheese options."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in this place you can tell that it's just not run well. It's apparent that they put a lot of money into the venue and the decor is nice. It was oddly quiet and there is no audible music. For a Saturday, it was sparsely populated so word must be getting out already that it's less than stellar. The first thing I noticed is the draft selection was weak. Miller lite, summer shandy, Guinness, hop hunter which was kicked, and a couple other nondescript beers. You don't get greeted when you walk in. I stood at the door waiting for someone to seat me and didn't realize you have to walk up the ramp to the. In order to get seated. Strange. When we say we ordered a bunch of apps. Crab cake, lobster pot stickers, fries, buttered noodles for the kids, stroganoff, wings, kale salad. The crab cake ($14) was the best item but the presentation was awful. The cake was like a blob of crab and the sauce they served was like a mayo and relish sauce just splattered on the plate. The pot stickers ($14) were embarrassing. There was nothing in them and they were tiny. They also used the same may relish as the crab cake. It looked like an 8 year old made it. Frozen pot stickers from a bag would have looked gourmet compared to this dish. The stroganoff ($21) used big noodles because they were out of the egg noodles. It had zero resemblance to stroganoff. It was like boxed Mac and cheese and super salty. The kale salad was actually very good. I'd eat that again. The kids buttered noodles were buttered shells with no flavor or salt ($8). That price for a kids portion of buttered noodles is just wrong. The wings were underwhelming. No big flavor. They charged us $3 for extra tomatoes and $2.75 for soda water. For that menu it was $144 with drinks. This place will be closed by December. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Came upon this place the other day and went for lunch. Our waitress was extremely accommodating and suggested some things she thought we'd like. The mac n cheese is AMAZING. We had the \"land mac n cheese\" which had a LOT of meat in it (I think it was pork, chicken breast, and meat loaf), and the perfect amount of cheese and huge shell pasta. Their soup was also pretty good--it was like a huge hug on a cold day. Definitely come here if you're in the mood for some good comfort food!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a \"go to \" place in my neighborhood for sometime now. EASE is Another try to establish an eatery in Edgewood. I so wish they would get a good  one. EASE is an average place with average food. Ho hum. 

My coworker and I had lunch here an ordered the poutine as an appetizer. Then ordered the meatloaf sandwich and crab cake salad.

First the poutine was rather tater tots with some pulled pork, a little bit of cheese and a bit of BBQ sauce drizzle. What makes anyone thinks that this could be considered poutine?!? No gravy! The tots were ok but dry and we had to ask for extra BBQ sauce just to finish them.

The meatloaf was ok, nothing to write home about. 

The crab cake salad. Well, the crab cake was actually tasty, but the salad was an odd mixture of flavors that just did nothing to compliment each other. We asked for some extra sauce for the crab cake because the dressing in the salad was odd and took away from the decent flavors of the crab. In hindsight, we should have just ordered the crab cake and nothing else. 

Service was friendly and fairly efficient, but they were not busy so I suppose it may have been a different story had it been busy because we only saw 1 waiter the entire time we were there. 

Over all it was somewhat disappointing for me, but my coworker said she liked it. Ergo the 3 star rating. Lucky my coworkers opinion was taken into consideration for this review. 

The search continues....."}
{"text":"It wasn't even that cold outside this evening but it was inside Ease -- owners don't even let the staff adjust the heat and there is no manager on staff. The cold glasses even made the hot toddy's cold by the time they reached the table. 

Very few vegetarian options"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:
The dining room is fairly spacious and the tables aren't crammed together which is a nice change of pace. The area does get quite noisy but that seems to be standard in most Pittsburgh restaurants...it would be nice if they could install some noise dampening things. There is a bit of varnish smell when you walked in due to the newness of the decor but after 2 minutes I couldn't smell it anymore. The restaurant is multi leveled (but there is a ramp for anyone with mobility issues) and there is a great picture window looking out over the street. We sat in the bar area which was a little quieter. 

Food
I've had dinner in the dining room and lunch as takeout. Dinner was fantastic...I ordered the cedar plank salmon with cornbread and asparagus. The salmon was cooked perfectly and came with a great soy type glaze. The cornbread was on the sweeter side and also excellent. I especially liked that they gave me a hearty portion....sometimes with fish dishes this is a issue but I left quite full. My dining partner had a chicken dish which he liked. We did try dessert...a s'more ice cream dish. It was tasty but nothing special. 

My second visit I ordered a BLT for lunch takeout. The sandwich was incredibly yummy...great bread and ingredients. The sweet potato fries that came with it were the perfect slightly crisp texture. I wish they had to lunch options available for dinner. Dinner prices are similar to what you would pay downtown which is fine for the food quality but if they had some lower priced options I probably would come here more often. 

Service.
No complaints. The meal was paced well and the server was pleasant. 

Anyway, I enjoyed my experiences thus far and will likely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here!  Unlike some other restaurants that have recently come and gone in this area, where you spend a fortune and get tiny portions of food without any flavor, this place does it right! The two meals we tried here, both seafood, along with a macaroni & cheese appetizer, were full of flavor and absolutely amazing!  They offer bread as a starter for $1, but you have to ask the waitress as this is not on their menu - the bread is made fresh by their chef daily and was delicious!  
The service was great!!! 
Go on Wednesdays, half off wine!"}
{"text":"As far as food goes, I've only ever had two things at Ease. The mac and cheese which I loved and a really interesting vegetable soup that was on special once that I would totally order again if it were offered. I think that 2 for 2 on the food makes it worth going back but if I'm totally honest, their Bloody Mary is awesome and that is definitely why I will keep returning. It's not a traditional flavor (maybe has bbq sauce in it?) but it is definitely worth trying. The decor is weird and doesn't fit the neighborhood. Maybe in more of a yuppie area like downtown or shadyside? Whatever. The Bloody Mary is excellent."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal. Service is very good, our waitress made our drink personally because the bartender was a bit behind. Good atmosphere in a good location. Was nice to be able to sit outside in pittsburgh. Good cocktails and wine list. Will definitely be back soon, need more places like this in the city.  Family atmosphere with good food and drinks without crazy prices."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with friends here tonight! I loved the seafood Mac & Cheese! It was a very generous portion with the perfect amount of shrimp, fish, and lobster mixed in! Two in our group ordered the cocoa & coffee crusted duck specials. The duck was super tender & flavors were amazing! Our waitress was wonderfully attentive without being intrusive."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the Honey Chili wings. They were good. I asked for the wings to be cooked well done. They were still a bit gooey, but the flavor was good. Had they been a bit crisper, they would have been a 10. 

Also had the steak salad. It was just ok. The steak was cooked medium as I requested, and it was tender, but lacked flavor. I wouldn't get it again. Nothing special. 

The service and the coffee were very good. Some of the sandwiches I saw other folks getting looked very good. I'll probably order a sandwich instead of a salad if I decide to return."}
{"text":"Deciding between 3 and 4 stars was tough.  

House cocktails are wacky.  I usually look at a house cocktail list and have trouble deciding which one to get.  Ease's list is the opposite - not one drink that I would consider ordering.  Ordered an Old Fashioned instead, and bartender gave me a drink which only mildly resembled a watered down one.

Dinner was good, not great.  My wife and I both salted and re-tossed our side salads after the first taste - something we never do.  Dressing tasted like oil and vinegar only.  I had seafood Mac and Cheese with old bay seasoning - which was excellent.  My wife ordered Veggie Mac and Cheese, which was supposed to have kale, mushrooms and peas.  Hers arrived with a ton of peas, one small morsel of a mushroom, and no kale.  It was tasty, but disappointing when compared to the menu description.

Our service was excellent - no complaints at all with service.

We're going to give it another shot and try other items our waitress recommended, which (in addition to Mac and Cheese), she highly recommended the stuffed meat loaf or the cedar plank salmon. 

Final comment on the decor.  The menu is all about \"comfort food\", which is a great theme.  Unfortunately, the designer didn't get the memo.  It's a  sterile environment which doesn't fit with the theme.

Will give it another shot and hope to add a star after next visit."}
{"text":"While the place was not very full on a Saturday at 630, the experience was overall good.  There was good live music bUt the atmosphere is too sterile/they need to cozy it up. The  server was not real friendly but the runner was and  she was also very responsive.  We had to ask for bread and the runner seemed taken aback at the request but brought us decent (tiny bit dry) biscuits.  The poached pear salad (7$) was very nicely dressed and flavorful. A lot of Mac and cheese on the menu. Veggie Mac  (16) comes with s salad. Mac was almost really good but needed more crust and something to Make it pop. I could not taste any smoked cheese and would have liked more mushrooms and carmelized onions. French fries were medium thick and perfectly cooked.  Bison burger (15$) was nothing special but tasted good.  The 21$ stuffed meatloaf was a nice portion. The accompanying veg were a little over cooked. The person who ordered it was quite satisfied.  They don't have vegetarian appetizers. I consider this place a little pricey and not oh-my-God good but I would go back- just order judiciously."}
{"text":"I thought it was expensive for what you get. Mac n cheese was $16, a little bland and did not hold a candle to Point Brugge. I was also disappointed in the lack of vegetarian options which is atypical for the neighborhood. Top this off with only a few beers on tap, I'll choose D's or Root 174 instead. Since they are brand new, I hope they tweak the menu a bit so I can give them another try."}
{"text":"My review will probably echo many of the others in that we were totally underwhelmed by the experience given the price point. The lack luster experience started right after we were seated. There were 3 waiters and no one seemed to know who was assigned  to our table. We ordered our drinks and I asked for one of the draft beers and I was told that the keg was kicked without a replacement. The beer selection was pretty poor so I ended up with a whiskey cocktail instead. Why the place didn't install more than 6 taps is beyond my understanding. It doesn't take an expert to see the craft beer craze going on. Anyway, my whiskey drink was way too sweet and tasted like it lacked the bourbon.

For dinner we ordered the land mac and cheese ($18) and the bison burger ($15). The burger was OK enough, but nothing special and mostly overcooked. The handful of limp and soggy fries served with it were a joke. My wife liked the mac and cheese, but I thought that it was under seasoned and bland. 

Like some of the other reviewers we were excited about a new restaurant coming to the neighborhood. We were disappointed when we saw the menu and price point, but figured we would try it anyway. We won't be back unless they decide to change their format."}
{"text":"As a Regent Square local, I was excited when I learned a new restaurant was moving into Dunning's old spot. Even though I had heard nothing but disappointing things about Ease, I thought I'd try their brunch with an open mind. As soon as I walked into Ease I got an uneasy (lol) feeling. The white lighting, the extremely distasteful artwork, and the \"modern\" ambiance which made me feel like I was in a low-security prison made my heart drop to a place lower than hell. We were seated in a dark corner and went over the menu. I had picked out the Eggs Benedict and a Cucumber Falls cocktail and couldn't wait to try, but where were the servers? The Ease employees were extremely hard to identify as they had no consistent dress attire. We waited 5 minutes, then another 5, then another 5. Finally a woman came out of the back and made direct eye contact with one of the members of our group. She then proceeded to walk toward us, stop, clean a few dishes off a table, and then walk back into the back without saying a word to us. I would say this place had bad service, but there was literally no service. After waiting for 23 minutes (confirmed by a text I sent upon arrival) without seeing a smile or a friendly voice, we decided enough was enough. We walked out and down the street to the Square Cafe where we were seated immediately and ordered within minutes. Could not be more disappointed with this experience and highly recommend you don't waste your time. I would prefer Applebees relocate from the Edgewood Towne Centre into that spot. I still wouldnt go there, but at least every time I walked/drove by I wouldn't get a sour taste in my mouth, reminded of the discourteous and ignorant staff that ruined my Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a delicious dinner here. We shared the herb parmesan wing appetizer, she had the ahi tuna special, and I had the mushroom ravioli. We said we were sharing the ice cream sandwich dessert, which was served already split on two places - a nice touch. We liked everything and agreed that we'd return."}
{"text":"Update: went back because I had such a great first experience. I wouldn't go back again. The salads weren't worth the money and there's no reason 3 lunch salads should take 45 minutes to get to us! There was only one other couple in the restaurant so it wasn't a busy time. I also ordered food to go and it was never placed. I wasn't charged for it but I wasn't going to wait an hour to get it either! Not happy with the service or the food. Bummer since it seemed like a fun spot to go to! I would rather try the other restaurants on the street. 

Original review from first visit: Went for lunch today. The crab cake salad was unbelievable! My husband got the bahn mi and said it is his new favorite sandwich. We are excited to go back to try more dishes! We might always get the crab cakes as an app just to have them! Seriously very good! Staff was very helpful and attentive! Yeah prices are a bit pricey for lunch but so worth it for fresh food and good service!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and got the Half and Half with a chicken cheese sandwich and French onion soup. Food is great. The French onion is SO yummy. My only issue is the portion sizes. The prices are pretty good, but you get half as much food as you would at your typical diner (for the same price). I've been here for brunch as well and it's the same problem. It's a bummer because I really love the food and the location is great!"}
{"text":"I was @ the bar for drinks & some snacks.  Service suffered from not enough training. There were 2 apps ordered and they came out  minutes apart.( $$ and rolled silverware in linen implies quality service.) We ordered Mac n cheese n wings. Mac n cheese was really bland lots of salt helped it a bit.. The menu said scallions with the wings(didn't get those) the menu also said honey chili glazed( there was a small amount of sauce . No glaze!  The sauce tasted like Mae ploy, aka sweet chili sauce right out of the bottle) not a crafted culinary creation. I will b back to see if ease can get it together."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that I have been to a number of fine dining options within the Pittsburgh area including Applebee's, Chipotle and the McDonalds on liberty ave so I have high expectations when it comes to food. For dinner I ordered the original macaroni and cheese which was very nice but I would describe as a boujee version of velveeta shells and cheese. My uncle Boyardee is a chef and I think he would be proud of this macaroni. 

In addition to the macaroni I had the raspberry mojito (phonetic spelling: MO-JY-TOE). I have never experienced a drink so tropical in my life. I honestly felt as if I was laying on the white sand beaches of the Jersey Shore while drinking it. 

I think if I get a chance to go back here I would order the macaroni and cheese of the day without knowing what macaroni and cheese of the day it is because I like to live dangerously and keep things interesting."}
{"text":"I really cannot recommend this place. We walked up on a Wednesday night and decided to try the new place. The decor inside is modern and cool, especially the neat ceiling. However, the service really put us off immediately. The hostess seemed very confused about what to do - there were only 2 of us, and she wasn't sure how to handle it when we said we didn't have reservations (though there were plenty of tables). She led us awkwardly around the seating area before we decided on a spot near the windows. Lovely window seating area, for sure. Our server was less awkward and actually quite nice; the bus person (I'm guessing) brought out the food, but we thought he might have grabbed the wrong dish as one of our orders was incorrect. He stared like a deer in headlights before going to get the (wrong) server, who had no idea what to do with us since he hadn't taken our order, who awkwardly went to get our actual server. It was all a very big deal, even though it shouldn't have been. It turned out they made the wrong dish for my dining companion, and the exchange of dishes themselves was also awkward - they took the dish away, then brought it back and said they were making another? It was very strange. 
To boot, the food just wasn't very good. I had the veggie mac and cheese, which had a strange texture - the vegetables were all done to different consistencies, including carrots that had neither crunch nor mush but only kind of a stale unsatisfying bite. The cheese had solidified somewhat on the noodles, making it difficult to eat. My companion enjoyed both the regular mac and cheese (the wrong dish) and the Land Mac that he ordered, but he said that it wasn't worth $16 (the original price, although maybe at that price with twice the amount food).
At least the server comped one of our beers for the awkwardness and bad order, and my companion got two orders for one, so they did that right and it was appreciated. The tunes playing in the background were also fun - loved hearing The Postal Service. However, it was a thoroughly awkward evening. I'm not sure I'll be going back as the food was not very good and certainly not worth the price, and I don't really like being stared at by people who are confused by the existence of customers."}
{"text":"So so sad to say this is not good. I would normally feel bad giving that review to such a new place, but the complete lack of execution on our meal was almost insulting. The Mac and cheese (tried the land and sea) lacked any taste at all - and that's their \"thing\" here from what I understand. The poutine was just a bowl of tater tots. The risotto on the scallop plate was basically uncooked rice. We live in the neighborhood and were so excited for a new spot. I suggest sticking with route174!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Regent Square and continue to refer to the area as 'my favorite neighborhood in Pittsburgh' so I was excited to check out Ease, which occupies the former Dunning's space on S. Braddock.  The space still reminds you of it's former occupant, however, it has been modernized and updated nicely.  

I went with a friend over holiday break and while the place had diners, I wouldn't call it overly busy.  My biggest complaint of the evening is that we were sat at a table that was smack between two other tables and did not allow you, or the neighboring tables, to push your chair out even an inch without smacking into the person behind you.  That will need to fixed because it makes for a very uncomfortable dining experience.  

Our waitress was definitely on the ball and we didn't have to wait long for drinks.  Wine prices were reasonable and I believe there was a nice selection of beers.

For dinner I had the wing special which had a trio of different seasonings.  One option was a sun dried tomato rub.  Very different and I enjoyed it.  I also had their baked brie, which was tasty.  

I need to come back and try one of the main dinner entrees and I think I'll be more impressed.  I met the chef/owner while there and chatted with him for a while and it is obvious he is very passionate about his menu and wants to succeed, which I want to see happen as well.  Because, after all, Regent Square is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Location: South Braddock Avenue (Regent Square Area). Street Parking & Lot Parking across from McBroom's. 

Restaurant: It's trying a bit too hard for the idea of comfort food. One thinks comfort food as being grilled cheese, many soups and homemade soul food. This spot isn't in line with it's title. The food is okay but not worth the price point and you feel that they are stretching to entice foodies with artisan craft but trying too hard. They have half price wine on Wednesday nights, and specials throughout the week. Also, the wine menu has a decent bottle/glass selection. 

Facility: When you first walk in look up and to the right for the host stand. It's not directly in front of you when you walk in. I don't like the grayness and white led lights. It's a relatively sobering experience and doesn't make you relax in your seat which is the idea behind a comfort food joint. They need warm lighting and comfortable seating instead of a gray, cold and overly white led industrial glow. 

Service: This is where this place excels. Both Mark/Julie servers are excellent. They know the menu, make recommendations and are both polished at service. I would come back here specifically for the service and nothing else. Very good people.

Overall: It's excellent service and a nice place to eat outside on a nice day. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. The food was pretty mediocre and not to par with the price."}
{"text":"Really disappointing lunch. Got BLT \"special\". Bacon was low quality, cooked unevenly, undercooked on some parts, or tough and chewy. Bland supermarket tomato. They forgot to put the melted cheese on. Fries were excessively salted. Took forever to get order in first place, then sent back for cheese and new fries. 
Waitress was very good but couldn't overcome kitchen. There were only four tables filled , no surprise."}
{"text":"Gosh! I sure love mac n' cheese! I honestly have to stop myself from going to restaurants (Bigham Tavern, hi) to prevent myself from ordering it. There are times when I let my guard down and just follow my heart and at Ease, I certainly did that! My boyfriend recently started working in Squirrel Hill so we've been eating a lot around Squirrel Hill and Regent Square. I had been wanting to try Ease's mac n' cheese so I was super excited when my bf was down to go after work one night. We both ordered the seafood mac. I feel bad because the mac was pretty good but, in a world of stellar mac n' cheese ( hi mac n' gold) you really have to blow me away (what up ghost mac from south side bbq). This mac was tasty but I didn't like the crust so much. The smokiness of the cheese was a little overbearing, the noodles could have been a little more el dente and the seafood was not the freshest. I want to go back to Ease but I will probably get a different entree!"}
{"text":"Whoa!!! We've been to Ease a half dozen times since its opening last spring. Ease is a great place to have good food every time you go, good unrushed conversation with friends, and great attentive service. But tonight was a whole different experience. 

Here's the Whoa!!! Tonight I went to a Tequila pairing dinner there. 5 tastings of tequila and mezcal were perfectly matched to poblano and pork tamales, chicken mole' pupsas, shrimp ceviche, chicken corn dog, and lapsung tea leche. Executive Chef Jimmy, Chef de Cuisine Sara, the line chefs, and service staff, i.e. Rachel simply out did themselves. To date, I have not had Mexican or Central American foods as delicious and beautifully presented in Pittsburgh. Was this Ease comfort food?? It sure was to me! in each and every dish the spices, seasoning, sauces, textures, and presentations created flavors that were out of sight! Ease has shown its creative breadth!! Now its time for multi-cultural Ease to be known, tasted, and comfort us with such dishes.

I sincerely hope Jimmy Brown chooses to add a special day a week or permanent places on the menu for all of those and other diversified dishes to the menu. Bravo to all the Ease staff who prepared a wonderful evening of food and a chance to meet new people, who quickly became friends as we shared these pleasures!"}
{"text":"Recently enjoyed brunch here with friends. The place wasn't too crowded on a Sunday afternoon. Our waiter was available just the right amount, and they let us sit to finish our conversation after we paid. We ordered the eggs Benedict, stuffed French toast, chicken fried steak, the Ease breakfast, bottomless coffee, and a mixed drink. I was surprised that each couple's bill was as low as it was (around $30ish, including tip). All the dishes were good. My only complaint is that when everyone else seemed to get more than enough food, the eggs Benedict didn't come with any fruit or even token lettuce leaves. Besides being heavy on the animal products, I was not full when we left, although I typically think of eggs Benedict as a large dish. Don't get me wrong: it was cheesy and delicious, and the poached eggs were perfectly done. I suppose I could have gotten a fruit cup as a side dish to go with it. 

Verdict: good brunch for a good price. Now we'll have to come back for lunch or dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Best damn Eggs Benedict I have had in a while! I just had a great brunch with friends - the atmosphere was awesome, the staff was supper friendly and on-top of everything, also they didn't rush us through our meal. My friends and I were there for almost 2hours just catching up and chatting. Great drink options as well for brunch! I have only been for brunch, but will definitely be back for a dinner :)"}
{"text":"Went to Ease on the recommendation of a good friend.  Nice comfortable modern atmosphere. Our server Mimi was very attentive and accommodating.  The food was excellent. Had the pulled pork poutine, stuffed meatloaf, veggie Mac n cheese as well as the land Mac n cheese. All were delicious. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"The seafood Mac & Cheese was fantastic along with the honey chili wings . Great ambiance, with quality service too."}
{"text":"My partner loves a good brunch, so we tried out this restaurant on a Sunday early afternoon. It was jam packed across the street, but plenty of seating available here - should have given us a clue. Partner ordered the chicken and waffles, and I ordered the brunch mac n' cheese. We both ordered coffee. I inquired about the peach juice for the mimosas to see if I could get just the peach nectar with club soda, and was told that it was actually a syrup, so she wouldn't recommend that I do that. Gross. Moving on.

We were served our meals and frankly, their visuals need work. The sausage gravy all over my partner's chicken and waffles looked like sick up, but according to him, tasted pretty good. Maybe let some of that hard working chicken show through? And my mac and cheese had hash browns in a layer on top (um, ok), and about half an inch of oil at the bottom. I get it, you used real cheese. Perhaps presentation in a closed cast iron enamel tray isn't the best bet when it's not letting some of the lake of grease sieve away. 

Finally, my partner, a fan of rich, dark coffee, was disappointed when he could see the sugar crystals falling through his coffee, it was so translucent. His other test is to pour about a teaspoon of milk into the coffee to see if it changes to white or barely changes color at all. This one went full white with one teaspoon of milk. I have a different test - since I rarely drink coffee, if I don't have the jitters by the bottom of the cup, I know it's weak. If I don't have jitters by the bottom of the second cup, I know it's actually dishwater with coffee flavor.

I know I'm being harsh, but it wasn't modern or comfort. Oh well."}
{"text":"Took the family there for brunch, and was quite underwhelmed. The service was ok, but it seemed like their system of entering the orders into the computer occupied a lot of the servers time.

The best meal served to us was my daughters basic eggs, potatoes and toast breakfast. My son ordered an omelette. Which was ok, but it comes as just an omelette alone, on a plate. Unless you order a side.

My wife had oatmeal and a fruit bowl. The oatmeal was cold, and the fruit bowl ridiculously priced for 8 sour blackberries, a few not quite ripe blueberries, and a few bits of mushy strawberries. 

I tried their fritada, which is really a flat omelette with a glob of cheese in the middle and a few bits of peppers and onions. Generally fritada is a bit different from that, although subject to interpretation.  Their interpretation is not a winner.

Saw some other plates served to others, and none of what saw made me say, boy I wish I ordered that. Brunch is definitely not their forte."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a relaxing, comfortable atmosphere- not to mention the bar selection is great! I've had the pork chop special which is one of my favorites, the seafood mac and cheese, the mushroom ravioli, and the stuffed chicken. Nothing has let me down! The menu is diverse enough that everyone can find something they will love. Not to mention the waitress, Rachel, is wonderful. Overall you really get the sense of happy workers, passionate cooks, and a wonderful anchor point for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ease is a chilled atmosphere, fairly small restaurant with a great feel.  A live jazz band was playing great music upon arrival and during dinner. The salmon and seafood mac & cheese were delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for an early dinner on a Saturday evening. We brought along our 17-month old and have realized that we can no longer bring the baby to \"nice\" places. The staff at Ease were very accommodating and super friendly. Our daughter definitely had a moment or two and I was thankful we were there early so it wasn't too crowded. Next time we'll get a sitter so we can take our time and savor the delicious food at Ease. My husband got a steak and felt that the sauce perfectly complimented the meat, as opposed to fighting against it. I had coconut shrimp that had the perfect amount of kick without being too spicy. Would love to come back (again when we have a sitter) and make a dinner out of the appetizers (looking at you Grilled Pineapple Scallop Ceviche) and be able to have more than one drink."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch to check out this new restaurant in my neighborhood. It has a very large and open interior with white walls, exposed ducts, and dark wood tables and chairs. The dining room takes up about 2/3 of the open design with several tables next to floor to ceiling windows. There were bright flower arrangements as well as some large statement art pieces. I noticed the smell of fresh paint as soon as I entered the restaurant. The bar is large with a handful of brews on tap and is situated on the left side of the restaurant, but it is clearly it's own space. 

I was seated near the kitchen but it doesn't have doors so I could hear dishes being washed, music, and sautéing. I was one of 8 in the restaurant but I waited more than 20 minutes for my meal, but all was forgiven and forgotten with my first bites. I wanted to try as much food as I could, so I ordered the  BLT with fried green tomatoes (needed more of those delicious tomatoes) with a side of their signature Mac n cheese (divine!) and house cut fries (I mean, I had to) served with Heinz tomato ketchup (I mean, they had to). 

I saved room for dessert and the server packaged up my leftover lunch. I ordered a cup of Colombian coffee and the ice cream sandwich. But it's not just ice cream- it's salted caramel gelato! And it's not just two cookies, it's two homemade double chocolate chip cookies, topped with a sweet caramel bourbon sauce ... Yum! The cookies were warm and fudgy with just a little bit of crust (aka perfect). 

I don't have pictures because my phone was charging at a nearby table, but I feel that the pictures wouldn't capture how flavorful the entire meal was. Service was great, my server was kind and open to my suggestion for more tomatoes on the sandwich, and prompt with the check. Excited to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Ease has some excellent food offerings we have been there a few times and their mac and cheese is delicious.  But my favorite theme night was the burgers and bourbon night.  You create a burger with a large list of options as well as different breads and meat selections.  They also have a terrific bourbon selection, which impressed my husband who loves a good bourbon.  The food is always delicious and well worth the price.  Ease is a great addition to Regent Square!"}
