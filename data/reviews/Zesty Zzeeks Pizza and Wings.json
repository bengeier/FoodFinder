{"text":"best pizza in tukee! also pizza fries are the bomb. customer service is always A1. Jody and Mark are the sweetest people ever. the breadsticks are to die for and the ranch is the best in town. we love zzeeks!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! They are always very fast and friendly for delivery. One of favorite places in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Zzeeks rocks.  Such great pizza and service. My kids favorite place by far! It's a must when we have a pizza urge. Try the wings, love the Honey Citrus Pepper."}
{"text":"Last night I ordered pizza at 10pm, and 40 minutes later I got a customer service text saying the order never went through and that the pizza place was not answering their calls. I had to call, re-order the pizza and have them charge my credit card twice. The costumer service then called me after texting me, saying that it did not go through but it was still going to charge me. At 11:15, I get a call from the Zeeks saying they typed in my address in wrong and that it would be another 10 minutes. Bad experience. Pizza was then cold, the fries were cold and soggy."}
{"text":"This is the best. Pizza is the best flavor. Also have had their meatballs. Great flavor. Fast super friendly service. Rest rooms are accessible to those in wheel chairs"}
{"text":"Pizza is always good their but their was a time last week or so that I went in on a normal Friday pizza day and the young man that helped us was very unfriendly. When we asked what the specials were he  pointed at the menus . I was very surprised to say the least .. Over all great pizza !!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and service are amazing here!  And for an added plus, local beers are cheap.  Do yourself a favor and order the spicy bbq chicken pizza - Delish!"}
{"text":"We ordered a thin crust pepperoni sausage with red onion 21 inch pizza. And we chose delivery as a mode of receiving it, and it arrived hot fresh and delicious!  For those who enjoy a crispy thin crust pizza, zesty zzeeks is your spot!  Cost was more than comparable for a pizza of this quality."}
{"text":"Zesty zzeeks thin crust pizza is off the chain delicious! For those two delight in a thin crust, crispy pizza then zesty Zeeks is right up your alley. On this order we enjoyed a pepperoni and Italian sausage with red onion, which was delivered hot, press, and fast. Zesty Zzeeks will definitely be receiving orders from us in the near future."}
{"text":"Zzeeks employees are always spot on and polite. I brought my family here while they were on vacation and they all enjoyed it just as much as I do.  The service is consistent as is the food. Special thanks to Marcus for remaking the sandwich.  I really hate complaining when my food is wrong but he handled it well. It wasn't his mistake but he apologized profusely. Thanks again, sir."}
{"text":"Not for me. Ate some slices around 5pm and have felt bloated and nasty all night; it's that kind of pizza (fast food-quality). Put a gross film on the roof of my mouth.  Also, not sure what's so \"zesty\" about their pizza- had to be the least salty pizza I've ever had.  I'm pretty averse to salty things normally, but I couldn't even taste anything on either the Philly cheesesteak or margherita slice.  Customer service was fine, except the guy who took my payment wiped his nose with the back of his hand right in front of me."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We come here all the time with the kids and they love the food, as do we. Not to mention the workers are friendly and helpful. Definetly a place to go to for a family night out!"}
{"text":"I went looking on groupon for some dinner and found this place.  I couldn't order enough food for just myself so I want able to buy the Groupon but even without the deal their food price is right on.  I ordered the Chicago Italian Beef and as a native it tastes just like home.  Plenty of food for a dinner but the customer service, from the cashier to the pizza maker, was even better. 5/5"}

{"text":"We ordered hot wings, a 16\" original deluxe pizza, and a chicken Parmesan sandwich.  The wings were very hot temperature wise and just right with the spice heat, pizza was great-lots of great meat, good crust, and notnswimming in grease.  My daughter loved her chicken parm sandwich.  Really was worth the money and delicious!  We are new to area and they will definitely be our go to pizza place!  Delivered on time."}
{"text":"Their pizza is so so so good. Thin crust, super flavorful, and perfect on a Sunday while watching some football and hanging out."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had in a long time! The sauce is zesty like the namesake and they hand toss their pizza to perfection. The staff are friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here!!  Love the people and the food:)  The owners are always on there feet  and incredibly sweet to everyone who walks through the door...  Before them never knew Mac n cheese bites could be so good!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered veggie pizza in thin crust and jalapeño poppers. Though the pizza tasted good, it was soggy. The crust wasn't crispy at all. That was disappointing. The jalapeño poppers were not spicy enough. No zing in that. It was the first time I had ordered from Zzeek's but wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"The girlfriend was craving pizza and wings and the favorable, although slightly limited, yelp reviews gave us reason to give Zzeek's a try.   We ordered some medium wings and just a simple pepperoni pizza. After sitting down and waiting for our food to arrive we noticed some scribbling on the chalkboard wall about a special for exactly what we just ordered plus and order of breadsticks. I guess it's ultimately our fault for not noticing but it would have been nice for the cashier to perhaps mention or recommend it.   We got our wings first and they came out fairly quickly. The flavor wasn't bad but they seemed soggy and it was all drumsticks and no wings. Personally I prefer wings so that was a little let down.  The pizza came out about 5 mins later and really didn't do anything good or bad worth writing about.   At the end of the day this was a run of the mill 3 star spot. Something I think you can find anywhere and everywhere. Better wings and at least recommending the special by the cashier probably would have earned a return trip to try a specialty pizza but we can find average food and service anywhere so we'll keep looking for a 4 plus star spot."}
{"text":"Terrific pizza! I have eaten pizza from all four corners of the US and I will say this pizza was very close to the authentic New York style pies. Mass quantities of tasty toppings... Best of all it was easy to order different types per half. I know this sounds rehearsed or like I was paid to write this, but honestly this was the best pizza I have had, since I moved to AZ last July. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I went mainly to try the wings, and feed the family while I enjoy my wing fest! The pizza was good! We got the 16' Meat Combo pizza with 20 Honey Citrus Pepper wings, and drinks. We spent about $40 and had leftover pizza, and no more wings left!   It was a great 1st experience,  and plan to visit again when I am in the area! They were nice and answered our questions. You get to see them make your pizza, from dough spinning to the oven. It is a great place for the kids, with an authentic pizzeria feel!"}
{"text":"The wings are GROSS!!! Worst wings I've ever had and I've had a ton! The service is HORRIBLE!!! Workers don't give a damn about their job or even the cleanliness of the place, tables were filthy. When they gave us out \"order\" the didn't realize we has a pizza also, which took another 5 minutes to receive. Worst place I've been to in a while! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME COMING HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Had this last night and all I have to say is AMAZING! This is definitely my new favorite pizza place and will be returning.  The staff is absolutely wonderful to deal with, especially Jodie. It is a little over priced but I'll deal with that as long as the pizza stays great and the customer service is as pleasant as it was yesterday.  You have to try their breadsticks, there so good! I promise."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, great customer service.  They don't make Groupon users feel like lepers."}
{"text":"First time here and I love it! The food is delicious. The employees and the owners are VERY friendly. They come up and talk to you to see how you are doing. I really admire the one on one interaction with customers.  Try the honey citrus pepper wings!"}
{"text":"Great food & drinks.  Kids had fun drawing on the walls. Staff was friendly, and courteous even though we were there during a busy time."}
{"text":"love!! love!!! love this place!! karaoke rocks! pizza is bomb! beer is ice cold!! My roomie, Marian and I come here all the time! The service is so friendly I feel like family. Have never been more welcome in a pizza place. Love you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we've come in, we have had exceptional service!! Amazing food - pizza and pasta - great, nice and friendly people. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is hand tossed,  super delicious, and one of the best pizza joints I have been to.  The wings are delicious and the beers are reasonably priced.  Oh and you can get the eegees here as well which are to die for.  Highly recommended, 5 stars,  two thumbs up! Oh and they deliver for FREE!"}
{"text":"Very good.... Good pizza, great wings, delivery was quick, driver was polite.... The ice cream was still ice cream at delivety..... would definitely recommend this place and will come back on my next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"Same pizza as Chuckie Cheese?  The crust and vegetables were undercooked, and there wasn't much quality to the toppings.  I hoped this \"Mom and Pop\" pizza place would be a good addition to Ahwatukee. Unfortunately not on the same level as Florencias, Bel'Italia, Vincent's, or Nellos (all local- Nellos owners live in Ahwatukee).  With Spinatos and Mellow Mushroom in the game as well I hope this place can improve and survive."}
{"text":"Zeeks has great pizza , I love there sandwiches and pasta!! Great atmosphere and friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"I had a pepperoni pizza and boneless buffalo wings. The pizza was good. I especially like the crust. However the boneless wings were a bit soggy on the outer core. I would like to go back and try their bone-in wings. They looked really good."}
{"text":"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Zzeeks; My husband and I cannot stop talking about our experience, last night, at your Ahwatukee location!  IT WAS GRREEAATT!!!!  Customer Service was \"five star\". You made us feel welcome and appreciated. Drinks: We enjoyed your very cold beer, in frosted glasses.  Appetizer: Pizza crust puffs? These were delicious with the marinara sauce.   Fries:  We had to try your fries and what an endless portion of yumminess. And, yes, we saved the best for last. Main course: Twelve inch pepperoni pizza. We savored every bite. Piece by piece. Slice by slice.  Wow!  Thank you for your excellent food and service.  Supa Trace"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best! First time coming here with my friends. The cashier was so so so nice. Even though we are a group of teenagers, she still respected us like we are adults. Overall an awesome place my friends and I will return to in the future."}
{"text":"I like Zzeeks...usually I go to south location on Warner for lunch breaks for a slice and a beer but I finally made it out on a weekend to take them up on the Sunday special of $.50 wings during NFL games.  The pizza is Ok and the wings are Ok...the beer selection is excellent with a fair collection of craft brews. The fact that they added Eegee's availability is awesome and something that made the wife want to come also!  So good work with that diversification! I don't come for premium food quality butsomething keeps me coming back,  so good work Zzeeks!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and they gave my plate while my friend waited. She was starving and got upset. Jody, the owner, reached out to me after my initial review and really explained what happened that day. I am extremely pleased with this level of customer service and so I went back and got to meet the manager Ed, who thanked me for reaching out and giving my honest feedback. This place is owned by dedicated people who really care that you to have a good experience. I'll be coming back for that gigantic pepperoni and sausage calzone Ed made for me."}
{"text":"Eaten both at the restaurant and got delivery.   Delicious. We have had  pizza, breadsticks, beer, and hot wings and I have to say they give chains a run for their money.   Not to far from Zipps, or Sushi Eye they do a lunch special that is amazing and with the amazing weather come have a beer on the patio.   This place is really good, staff is friendly, and polite, they are always advertising some great deals so check them out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We discovered Zzeeks about two weeks ago and have visited four times since. We've loved everything we tried and the friendly staff have always been helpful.   The pizza is incredible. Real hand tossed crust with real toppings. For example, if you order bacon, you get real breakfast bacon crumbled on your pizza. Their dough has the perfectly thin blend of chewy, doughy crunch. The sauce is flavorful yet not overpowering.   Their wings are crisp and meaty with  great sauce variety. Don't miss 50  cent wings all day Sunday. Two people can split a drink, a 12\" pizza and a dozen wings easily for a very budget conscious total.   We haven't tried any of the sandwiches or calzones yet, but those are next on our list. What we've seen go past to other tables looks good.  One thing is for sure, these folks aren't playing around, the calzones look big enough to sink a ship. And the 20\" pizza provides plenty of the best cold pizza leftovers we've ever had.   They do run great specials including giant single slice deals. Friday is karaoke night that's apparently very popular with kids. So, finding a table can be a challenge. However, any other night (that we've been anyway), you'll find that little neighborhood pizza joint that blows the chain pizza places out of the water.    I joined Yelp because of Zzeeks."}
{"text":"Super good pizza!!! Ordered the veggie with ham added. Light and crisp crust and TONS of veggies!!! Took a friend for his first time and he really liked it too! Best pizza in Ahwatukee!!!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, pasta and yummy desserts!  Service is always fantastic!! Great lunch specials make this an easy pick over a drive through and a number 3!!"}
{"text":"I am usually skeptical about a place that has high reviews with only a few reviewers. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find great pizza, wings and salads with fresh ingredients. Plus they have Eegees. I probably won't go eat pizza across the street anymore. This place is that good."}
{"text":"Was up in Phoenix from Tucson for the day and chose to eat here based on positive yelp reviews. Pulling up I thought \"looks like your run-of-the-mill shopping center type joint\" bit decided it was still worth a stop.  I am sure glad we did. The service was amazing from the moment we walked in the door and the food was fantastic.  I choose to have my calzone deep fried (I know, I know, but it's worth it!) and was quite happy with the result. The texture is perfect and the added crispness was a pleasant surprise. When it was delivered I was asked if I wanted ranch or marinara to dip it in. My reply was \"marinara, no, ranch, well, I don't know. I guess ranch.\" Their reply \"you must mean both. Both it is then!\" Little customer service touches like that are what sets Zzeek's apart from the competition.  Looking forward to my next Phoenix trip which well certainly conclude with a visit to Zzeek's!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! The owners are very friendly. The past two times I've gone they've thrown in extra slices of pizza or complementary garlic sticks. Lots of beer on tap too."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wings, Ive been going for a few months now. The owner and the staff are all really nice."}
{"text":"Eat here very often, usually delivery. Absolutely love their pizzas. I've tried a bunch of them, the dough is super tasty and they have great options to choose from.   I also like that they have a few Eegees flavors to choose from. Delivery can take a little while, but usually the wait is worth it. All of the delivery people have always been really nice too."}
{"text":"Many repeats to the 48 & Warner location as the food never disappoints. Quiet environment it is not, but great for families & teens.  On line take out ordering has worked well for me.  Once our pizza had to be re-done because the bottom was burnt.  Jody immediately offered up free desert for the inconvenience.  I have never seen any slackers working @ Zzeeks.  Jody really runs a tight ship! Oh...did I mention the food ingredients are always really fresh."}
{"text":"It was a work at home day in Ahwatukee and I had a craving for ham and pineapple pizza. Yelp showed Zzeek's Pizza Factory nearby offered free delivery. I called and the phone was answered quickly and enthusiastically. A large can be 16\" or 20\" so I ordered a 16\" ham and pineapple. \"Expect a delicious soft crust with red sauce on your pizza in 20 minutes.   May I call in an hour to be sure you were satisfied ?\"  An amazingly delicious pizza arrived in 15 minutes. Lots of pineapple and larger than expected slices of ham. Wonderful red sauce and soft crust. It was so tasty that I ate four slices before I could stop. I did receive a phone call from Zzeek's inquiring about my satisfaction. Not typical of most pizza shoppes, it was as if my order was special and they would always strive to make excellent dishes.  A 16\" pizza that hit all of the taste buds for under $17  ? delivered ?? The driver earned his tip by arriving while the pizza was still hot and making sure the box stayed level. I hate it when the contents are scrunched in the corner.  Zzeek's, you are my new go to pizza emporium."}
{"text":"The pizza was tasty, the wings were pretty good--definitely up there, though I felt the flavor could have been stronger. The pizzacookie definitely makes up for everything. You absolutely have to eat one after your meal. It was incredible. It was transcendent. Sometimes I look at the full moon and think....if only I had enough ice cream, maybe we wouldn't have tides....."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and a very nice \"pizzeria\" atmosphere. Some of the best pizza I've ever had and definitely the freshest mozerella I've tasted. The staff is friendly and courteous as well. We will absolutely be back, again and again."}
{"text":"order mac and cheese. kraft mac and cheese is better than what i got. same kind of pasta as the box but with very watery liquid. I will call it pasta water, like the water you cook the pasta with. absolute no cheese in it. Also order spaghetti with sauce and meat ball. The sauce was like pizza sauce, thick and salty. The meat balls are blend , like two hamburger ball very dry. I would not comment on the price. very disappointed. Trying to hep local small business but will not come back. two cans of cook pasta and box of kraft are way better in taste and quantity and much less expensive."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza was awesome - the bbq chicken was a tad sweet but still great. Loved that they offer Eegees for the Tucsonians out there!"}
{"text":"My wife placed an order at 7:15 with a ready time if 7:35. We arrived at the restaurant at 7:40 and paid and were advised just a few more minutes. At 8 my wife went to the counter and the OWNER advised us they couldn't find our order so she offered a free pizza for NEXT time. Then we had to wait another 20minutes for the pizza. Worst service ever. Manager left early instead of confirming our order was ready on time. Will never visit this location again. No reason to lose an order when the restaurant was so slow and had people standing around. Unprofessional manager and inexcusable service provided. Comp the meal we waited over an hour for instead of \"next time\". Definitely won't be return, TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Zzeeks, and I love this place. The pizza is fresh and the manager is a real people person. The customer service is right up there with the food. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Tried this place for the first time today and I was impressed. The delivery was quick and the pizza was huge! (I ordered the 20\" for my roomies and me) the family sized order of bread sticks was delicious too. Would definitely recommend this place to a friend!"}
{"text":"We ordered Zzeeks pizza and wings to complete our football Sunday - the food was great and everyone was very friendly. Happy to have found another reliable place to get good pizza in our area!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here, and was really in the mood for some spicy food. I ordered their mega diablo wings. One of the absolute best wing sauces I've had that is at that level of heat. It's hard to get a sauce that hot without it being bitter and uninteresting. Only took one wing to get the hiccups going, which is impressive in itself. I definitely recommend caution on these for something simply feeling brave. They live up to their name.  The delivery driver, and the other fellow I spoke with at the store were extremely friendly.  Definitely recommend giving this place a go, and plan to order again in the future."}
{"text":"If there were a non-disgusting way for me to make a bed out of the cheesy bread from Zzeeks, I would sleep on it every night. Seriously amazing.   Other than that: great customer service, and delicious everything. I asked for my pizzas to be ready at a very specific time for pick up, and they were pulling them out of the oven as I walked in. Will definitely be back! :-)"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza I've ever had! I've been going to Venezia's for my pizza and this place puts it to shame! Much fresher and no soggy pizza!   Plus the owner of this place is the best! He asked if the pizza looked alright, if it didn't he would made another. That's great customer service."}
{"text":"I haven't even had the food yet and so far my experience has been incredible. I had a blonde moment and accidentally ordered 20 bone in wings. I can't handle bones in my meat. Just a weird thing. I asked the guy at the front how big of a deal it would be to maybe get the boneless. I was expecting a simple no because it's wasting 20 wings. Instead of making me feel dumber than I already felt, he politely said that if I didn't mind waiting, he'll have them right out. I'm a wing and pizza fanatic, being a Chicago native. This place is definitely going to be my new hang out spot for an ice cold PBR on tap (I know. I'm cheap lol). Can't wait to dine in soon! And shout out to the wonderful staff you have working here. You guys are taking customer service to a whole new level!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun environment and exceptional customer service. Thank you for going above and beyond to make my Brian's Birthday so special!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Fresh made pizza and fresh made sauce. Family owned and always friendly."}
{"text":"Delivery people are great Had a complaint about the food and got nothing but interruptions and back talk  They even called me back to try to prove that I was wrong NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Not overly friendly though.... There was about 8 employees working, and not ONE said hi when I walked in! (Same thing to the people behind me)  and when my order was ready he just handed to me and said nothing... I would  eat there again cause it was yummy and the prices are good! But I will get delivery so u wouldn't have to face that issue again and if the driver isn't friendly there will b no tip and I won't try it again!"}
{"text":"Great customer service!!! I placed an order over the phone for my sons school and I had a lot of questions. Sara was so patient,  helpful, and answered all my questions. I will definitely use them again!!!"}
{"text":"An associate recommended.......glad I listened!!!! Ordered 16\" original beast w garlic.......IM IN HEAVEN"}
{"text":"Just moved from PA to AZ, tried large pizza with pep, burned, over cooked and expensive, $17.00, sauce was average"}
{"text":"While visiting the Tempe area & exhausted from the Holiday shopping, I wanted to try some good pizza & called Zesty Zzeeks. The pizza was delivered timely, hot, X-Lrg was Huge & it was very good, so thanks Yelp."}
{"text":"Zeeks is awesome. I have never been inside but have ordered delivery numerous times. I am not a huge fan of their pizza but seriously.. Order a side of meatballs. The best meatballs I have ever tasted. I can't get over it. They also make a great calzone. Even the fries are bomb. Oh! And super fast delivery!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza!! Some of the best I have had in the valley....or anywhere for that matter.  Its a little bit on the expensive side but definately worth the extra cost. I eat there whenever I am in the area. Too bad there is not one in Chandler....on second thought, maybe thats a good thing, since I would be eating there all the time."}
{"text":"Really great pizza, from out of town and was looking for something that delivers to the hotel. It showed up hot and before the promised delivery time. Super nice delivery driver that brought plates, napkins, pepper, and cheese."}
{"text":"So disappointed by you guys ... I've been in before and everything was awesome! Great employees great time and for a place that only has a small tap system the beer was good too... but I will never order deliver again! The sandwich they made my sandwich on was dryer the the Sahara ! You should probably take the time to cut a footling hot sandwhich in half or serve it on break that hasn't been out all day ... Not asking much !  A chicken bacon ranch should have ranch also ... Mc n cheese bites were not please in in any way to any senses !! Pizza was ok ! It's like everyone lost all their passion at the same time ... Idk if I'll be back guys. I'm so disappointed. There is more I want to say but like I said I enjoyed it when I came in so I'll keep it to myself"}
{"text":"They have egees!! The pizza is good and their lunch combo is a pretty good deal!  Nice little neighborhood place."}
{"text":"I ordered a small Margarita and small Deluxe and some wings. They delivered a Deluxe and a cheese and wings. Called to tell them that they gave me a cheese instead of the Margarita and they put me on hold then hung up. Whatever. The first bite of the pizza and I knew the ingredients and dough was sub par. Almost like frozen pizza taste. The pepperoni was paper thin and I mean paper! The wings were good but who cares, it was the pizza I wanted. And with all the good reviews I was surprised. Go across the street to Venezia's, you won't be disappointed there."}
{"text":"It's been a long while since I had delivery pizza this good, everyone here agreed. It was great. The Chicken Pesto was delicious with artichokes and the Hawaiian had the best on pizza ham ever. I will be back. The price was worth it."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza joint in the Tempe area. On top of having great pizza, they offer a multitude of sides, appatizers, sandwiches, and desserts. Seriously, the menu is huge. If you do end up getting a sandwich try the Cajun tots. They have a really friendly staff. If you're in the area check this place out ASAP."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and wings. Great flavor and prices. Pizza had nice zesty taste,  very filling and the wings were crispy but also had plenty of sauce. Very impressed and will be definitely coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This pizza is pretty cool. It's 19 bucks for a Large. I always get delivery which takes between an hour to an hour and a half. Plus they always forget my ranch. I always get the extreme pepperoni pizza because it's really good. It has all kinds of different pepperoni. I also like that they have Pepsi instead of Coke."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! They definitely are not shy with the toppings! Delivery under 40 mins"}
{"text":"After my previous visit and review, the owner of Zzeeks (Jody) reached out to me and offered to have me visit again. Since I love pizza, and the criticisms I provided in my earlier review were minor and easily correctable, it was an easy decision to give them another chance.  First, let me say that Jody was very friendly and assured me that she had spoken to her staff about my experience. It is obvious that she cares deeply about the business and her customers. She made me a small pepperoni pizza for lunch, which was cooked perfectly and very tasty. I love supporting local businesses, and they are very active in our community. I will definitely be coming back and bringing my family with me next time."}
{"text":"Zzeeks is the best. Just went on Sunday and the owner was great - especially attentive to my 88 year old mother. She's a picky eater and he did a great job keeping her veggie toppings on the 2 small pieces she eats, while filling the remaining pizza with chicken, ranch and cheese for us.  We like the location as it's near our house in Tempe, with great food and service!  Besides the pizza, we love the boneless wings and the dessert sticks!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here but today for a late lunch  I had the medium hot wings and WOW they were the best wings I ever had!  The crunch really made them the exceptional.  Wish I lived closer to enjoy more often."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings, quick delivery time and friendly over the phone when ordering.  Compared to dominos this place is 10 stars."}
{"text":"Okay guys, this is pretty underwhelming pizza. I'm not sure if I am from Chicago and just know good pizza, but I would rather have Costco pizza than this. Even pizza hut pizza trumps this place.The jalapeño poppers were pretty good. Would not come back here again."}
{"text":"Pizza, Boneless Wings, and Mac and Cheese Bites were all excellent. Delivery was prompt and the service was great. I'll definitely be trying more options."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. We had pizza and wings and I'm here to tell you that they were great! The service was fantastic the place was clean and I am certainly going to come back in fact I think I'm going to buy 30 wings for the Super Bowl today. Check them out they do deliver and I'm excited to try other things I forgot to mention that I had the calzone it was fantastic"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great drink specials. The crew there is friendly, all together a great place to grab some pizza and beer."}
{"text":"Zzeeks we started off rough a couple of years ago. But you have won me over. The best delivery food in Awhtukee Foothills. It is worth the extra $2. Food is always on point and warm. Thank for the great food and making it easy for great meals for a single dad...."}
{"text":"I just got carry out from this place for the third and final time. You know how they say fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me? Well, fool me three times and I guess that makes me a glutton for punishment. Or maybe just a guy who likes Eegee's. the pizza has been disappointing each time but this last time it was completely over cooked.  We always go when we want Eegee's  but next time I will skip the pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing wings and eegees! Made my night more interesting finding out I can spike my eegee! Went with the lemon pepper and mega diablo hot wings tonight, definitely will be going back for more of those! Couldn't find a thing to complain about tonight . Coming back on Friday since I heard they also have karaoke!"}
{"text":"The pizza was doughy and the cheese tastes plastic and greasy. The lunch special  Is way overpriced and I was very disappointed.  My friend wanted to leave as soon as we got there. I should have heeded his warnings. And I don't know what's up with all the anti Semitic slurs written on the walls. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and atmosphere was relaxed! Owner was awesome and always is very nice to my mom when I bring her in. They even have an Eegees!"}
{"text":"Had the hot Honey BBQ wings and they were so good. The place also has a cool vibe with chalkboard walls."}
{"text":"Hello ALL,   I first ate at Zzeeks Pizza about 2 years ago when a good friend Marian referred my Fiance and I to it saying it was the best pizza in town. Little did I know my kids had already been there with their mom prior to me knowing about it and loved it as well.   So we tried it and loved it. They have the best ranch dressing as well. Since then we have gone inside to eat and order delivery. The best thing about Zzeeks is they are family owned and very customer friendly to everyone. There was a time or two where they delivered and forgot the ranch dressing and because it was their mistake, they brought us another cheesy bread for free without us even asking. The owner said it was our mistake and we wanted you to have fresh cheesy bread as well. If you ever have a problem they will take good care of you with no hassle. Great people and great service. If you havent tried Zzeeks then you are missing out! Also what place do you know where the owner sometimes personally delivers to your home. I honestly can't say enough good things about these great people.  THANKS AGAIN ZZEEKS, KEEP UP THE GREAT SERVICE!!!! :)  Sencerely,  Mike and Jordan Knowles"}
{"text":"Zzeeks is amazing! Local, family owned shop that supports the community and has amazing pizza (and breadsticks, don't forget the breadsticks!!).  We go there often and have never had anything less than an awesome experience. Case and point-my daughter's birthday last weekend. Jody had the space all ready for us, she invited my daughter back to learn how to make pizza and checked on us several times to make sure everything was perfect (which it was). We had a great time and you can tell they are very focused on making the experience great.    Great family-friendly environment, always a good variety of games on the tv and tiles for the kids to write on while they wait.  Excellent delivery service, online ordering for convenience.  Good beer specials too, and of course, they carry Eeegees :)  All around, Zzeeks is delicious and the most family-friendly pizza place in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family, and the meal was lovely. Our server was very attentive and helpful with all of our questions about the menu. Overall, our experience was spot on. The problem? When our check came, I tipped our server accordingly, as they worked hard to deserve it. As it turns out, they didn't receive it. This particular restaurant does not allow the servers to keep the tips they make. They don't even tell them how much they have received. At the end of the week, they \"divide it up\" amongst the entire staff. To some, this may sound fair. But in the restaurant business, cooks make an hourly wage to compensate them for their hard work in a consistent manner. Servers make a very small hourly wage, but depend on their tips as their income. The owners make their money in the profits from sales. I was astonished to find out about their backwards approach to compensation. I'm pretty sure this is illegal. Nowhere on the menu, in any sign in the building, or on the receipt does it express that the tip I designate for my server is taken by the owner. Anyone seen Restaurant Nightmare, Amy's Baking Company? Same concept.  I would definitely come back again, however, now I know to always tip in cash and express to my server that it is for them and them alone, not for the owners."}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon. Left happy. We ordered two pizzas, one chicken with white sauce and the other half meatlover and half veggies. Ordered wings in medium and a sweet sauce (can't remember what it was called).  The wings were EXCELLENT. Pizza was really good too. Pretty pricey though, so that is the drawback. The food including three drinks came out to $60 before the groupon (for three people dining in).  A good experience but not a weekly thing"}
{"text":"Definitely enjoy this place. Try the Philadelphia cheesesteak pizza and add Jalapeños and bacon. It'll be the best choice you've made today :) also don't forget their wings. If you like the crispy saucy type, that slip off the bone; then this is your place.  Enjoy your eats!"}
{"text":"Cane back today for lunch. Extra crispy wings and a slice. It was great. Ed gives such great customer service. So good took hubby a grand slam to go."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and tasty wings! Zzeek's always hits the spot for me. They are friendly, always remember my order, and have quick delivery. Try the chicken bacon ranch pizza or honey citrus pepper wings... so good!!  Oh, and breadstick bites are like crack. Seriously. Can't stop at just one."}
{"text":"I have loved Zeeks pizza for quite a long time and was happy with the food however the restaurant was a mess.  What is worse is when we notified the manager she didn't seem to care and seemed upset that we mentioned it.  This was unusual because the management is normally very friendly.  I hope they take this to heart and improve the cleanliness.  If so I will update my rating."}
{"text":"Got a medium Hawaiian pizza from zesty zzeeks yesterday. It was yummy! Generous toppings and cheese! Love the crust! Very homemade tasting! Almost reminds me of my mom's made-from-scratch pizza. Decently priced, with coupon."}
{"text":"This is not gourmet pizza. Okay, now that's that out of the way, I was glad to see them open on a Sunday night at 10 pm. My sister and I had been out all day and I was tired and hungry. She got a salad and I got pepperoni pizza. Overall, this did take some time. I liked the pizza. I thought it was pretty good. Was it the best? No, not really. But it was good enough for a starving human. Customer service was also good."}
{"text":"We recently discovered this little gem. I love how fresh everything is. Order a slice special, and it is made for you (not re-heated). The food has been outstanding. Service has been a bit hit or miss, but I suspect it depends on the time you get there. That being said, we have enjoyed everything we have tried there and will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered some food tonight for the first time after reading the reviews.  We got the breadstick bites, boneless wings and a 16 in pepperoni and bacon pizza.   The breadstick bites were alright.  They seemed a little on the burnt side but had good garlic flavor.  I'm glad the marinara served with them was warm and not cold.   The wings had almost no sauce on them at all and just looked like some boneless wings you'd buy at the grocery store.   And the ranch that came with had a really sour, nasty taste to it.  I passed on eating the wings.  The pizza was just okay also.  It, too, seemed almost burnt.  The pizza probably could have come out of the oven a few minutes earlier and it would have been perfect.  Since it was over cooked, I could only eat one slice cause it seemed really dry.  The flavor wasn't bad however.  Over all I don't think I'll be back.  It just wasn't good enough for me to want to give it a second shot.  And it definitley wasn't worth the $40 I spent on all of this food."}
{"text":"This was a great experience, mainly due to the customer service. I decided to order a pizza relatively late at night, 10 pm. I received my pizza at 10: 35 with an apology from the driver for his tardiness, along with the pie. He stated the pizza was late late due to the fact that the last one was \"too dark\". They gave me the pizza that was \"too dark\" for free and a delicious pizza that was cooked just right.  Both on the phone and in person the staff was amazing in spite of the time of night. I feel with the right support this could be a great pizza shop for the area."}
{"text":"My fiancé loves this place and he decided to take his niece and I here. I was too excited to try it out that I forgot to take a picture of it.   Ordered one of the specials that included two 12in one-topping pizza, breadsticks bites, and two fountain drinks for $25 (not including tax). They served a full plate of breadstick bites topped with garlic and parmesan. And we ordered one cheese pizza and one pepperoni pizza. All of them were freshly made!!!   One cool thing about this place is that they have little tv's in each booth, which makes it really convenient when there are multiple games going on at the same time.   All in all, I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found pizza with a flavor other than sweet!  We had our first pizza from Zzeek's tonight.  Very happy with it.  Crust was just the right combination of crispy and chewy.  Toppings were plentiful.  Staff was friendly.  Prices were reasonable.  But, THE SAUCE!  Wow!  The sauce really stands out from any other we've had in a long time.  So many of the chains have defaulted to an overly sweet sauce.  Leave it to an independent to make it the way it should be!  Zzeeks sauce has a great herby/spiciness that is hard to beat.  While I was happy with the toppings we chose for our pizza, my next one might just be cheese with a extra sauce!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good. Meatball Sandwich is the best! The Zzepoles desert is incredible.  Great stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Well I've changed my diet w drs orders. Pizza isn't ideal but not having to eat gf I have to have it now and then. So my fiance insisted the regular pizza here is great. I was reluctant to try but did. So glad I did! Yummy. Well deserved new review!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say? The pizza is great and so are the wings! My fiancé orders a new sandwich each time we come here, and I order a calzone! Sometimes they're a little over cooked, but never too much to be thrown away! The wings are cooked to perfection and the many sauces pair great with each other! The desserts here are okay, our favorite is the root beer float. This is our go to place for last minute decisions."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Zzeeks yesterday around 4:30pm for an early dinner for the first time.  We will not be back.  We ordered several appetizers and pizza.  At first we were excited because of all the great reviews.    Before I get into the food I have to say..the cleanliness of the place was really bad.  The kitchen from what I could see looked clean but the dining area was filthy.  Uncleaned tables, greasy hand marks on the small tv's and windows.  Floors needed a good sweeping as well.   Buffalo chicken pizza- the original crust is a good thickness but the bacon bits on the pizza made the pizza salty and greasy.  Also, there was very little sauce.  If we ever order it again we would say no bacon, mozz cheese instead and extra sauce.   Califlower Pizza- they served us gluten free pizza and told us it was cauliflower crust.  Very disappointed.  The whole reason we went to Zzeeks was because they sold carb free crust.   Cheese curds, wings aNd jalapeno poppers- these came out hot and tasted good."}
{"text":"I'm a new customer for them and have ordered twice in the past month. Both times I've placed an order for delivery I spoke wit Jodi and she is sooooo nice! Great customer service with excellent recommendations. The pizza is delicious, not unlike the yucky cheap $5 little caeser stuff..& I love their buffalo wings! Usually they are a hit or miss with me, but theirs is delicious!  Jodi gave me a menu of their other items along with my order and I can't wait to try out more of their items! :)"}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot at Mill and Southern with a $5 lunch special, Pepsi products, and a bunch of televisions. Not too shabby at all."}
{"text":"Zzeeks is awesome! They are ALWAYS on time, don't charge for delivery & their pizza is amazing! I love the neighborhood vibe they give off too! It's our go to pizza shop!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for pizza and hit up good old Yelp!!  I haven't been disappointed yet!!! The reviews and the fact that they had tv's and had beer sold me. They didn't disappoint!!  The beer was cold and had frosty glasses.  The pizza is top notch!! I had the Philly Cheese steak pizza and it was excellent!! The crust was nice and crisp, I was not disappointed!! I would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"I placed a phone order for a delayed pickup of a to-go sausage pizza, an Italian Beef (they call it a Chicago Beef) and some hot wings.  I arrived at the store, settled the bill and stepped outside to wait because it was still in the oven which is much preferred over having it waiting in cardboard of course- given I was in no hurry.  Stupendous.  Timed perfectly and hand delivered to my parked car outside the door by a helpful young staffer.  Presented/wrapped nicely for transport...the beef sandwich was exactly to my liking.  Not soggy but with some ajus for dipping.  Sandwich roll would be much better if it was crunchy outside and soft inside.  You know.  Like Chicago rolls that, when opened, leave a handful of crumbs on the tablecloth but this is Arizona and you can't get decent bread here except Safeway (40th St./Chandler Blvd) has great French loaves and bulk hardrolls that you can drop into paper bags provided so they stay crunchy but wait, I'm writing a review for Zzeeks so nevermind that right now)  ...pizza was nicely thin w/ yummy sauce and the wings, although not very crispy (I had asked for well done), were excellent (although not cayenne hot enough for me) and a bit wet from the sturdy packaging sweat no doubt so better after air-drying for a while.  Served w/ ample white dressing and some veggie sticks for a classy finish.  Three menu items.   Three home runs.  Thank you, Zzeeks.  I'll be back.  === UPDATE: um, dummy, you have to hit \"submit\" ===  Yes.  I'm a complete ninny and forget to actually post that review above from several weeks ago.  yelp saves your unfinished entry.  So, I'll continue..  Some weeks later, I thought I'd try the online order process via zzeeks.com.  I entered an order very similar to the one above and included CC info to pre-pay online. System tells me the order will be done in like 11 minutes and I should have an email receipt.  I live nearby but, geeze, I don't even have my shoes on and no email has been received yet so I phone the store...   Greeted by a nice young man (I'm guessing prepubescent) somewhat hurried (much activity in the background which is usually a good indication after 35 years of trickle-down Reagan lies leaving a beleaguered citizenry with virtually no disposable income for frilly extras like food but willing to sacrifice other necessities for good pizza ) so I explained the lack-o-email.  He said, \"we probably didn't get the order\".  Well, OK, I now repeated my order over the phone with still, the 11 minute ETA.  [I didn't occur to me to ask for a slight delay while I tried to find my shoes.]  I get there a few minutes tardy, store is busy but not slammed, the order is already waiting for me and, without thinking about my online payment, I pay the kid cash [I was right, he was about 11 but very professional]  and leave w/ my pizza, sandwich, wings.  Food commentary:  Pizza was kinda lame/cooled [admittedly, I was tardy] but how does a pizza get made, baked, packaged and old in 11 minutes?  Hmmm.  But wait.  There's more.  Bottom crust flour burn!  My pet peeve!  I know that Zzeeks knows this so I'm stating only for the casual review reader:  Pizza oven stones have to be scraped throughout the shift.  It sucks, it's hard, it's hot and in a busy store with a crowded oven, it's often neglected.  My first purchase (reviewed above) did not suffer this so I'll excuse a one-off for now but for the record, the overpriced Mellow Mushroom down the street at 50th St./Ray did this to me twice and they lost a customer.  The punchline is yet to come so hang with me...  Some time later, of course, the on-line order charge is debited from my account!  Again, this is on me for not mentioning it when I paid cash but an annoyance nonetheless.  I jot down the date, specs, amount on a sheet of paper and, when passing Zzeeks a few days later, I stop in to talk to the manager.  A pleasant gentlemen greets me:  \"Manager's not here.  Can I help?\"  -sigh-  As I start with my story he interrupts me:  \"How much do we owe you?\"  I try to explain that I've already requested a credit via the website and don't want to make this worse.  He opens the till, hands me $32.20.  I assure him that, if a credit shows up, I'll come back with a check.  He says, \"I believe you would\", and asks, \"Is there anything else you need?\"  I say \"Yes.  May I have your name?\"  He responds:  \"Zzeek\"  Now you know the rest of the story.  Can you see me at the Pizza Hut counter with my lame debit card story?  \"Could I speak to Mr. Hut please?\"  I'd have to hire an attorney and leave my DNA.  I'm looking forward to my next order.  I'll be on time.  The oven stones will be scraped.  I'll order in person and pay with money.  It doesn't get better.  -paul"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza delivered from a family owned restaurant with local teens helping out. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great Eegees and good options I love it I ordered and it came so fast the only complaint is that I ordered a soda with it and they brought me the wrong one so they had to go back and grab the right one but in all great service thanks. And I still have them a tip :)"}
{"text":"We had pizza and wings. Does it get any better? This place is very good. A family oriented spot. And they were packed (7pm on a Friday).They do have beer on tap and karaoke on Friday evenings 6-9 (If memory serves). All the kids where singing no adults. Very entertaining. A couple of the kids were quite good. We had the meat pizza and were not disappointed. Very good pizza, nice amount of toppings and tasty sauce. Winds were cooked perfectly. Not too dry, I can't stand over cooked wings. We finished eating and stayed to watch a couple of the kids sing. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Always a quick delivery, tasty food and great service. I messed up my funds with an order and the man there took care of it right away by graciously splitting my payment and still sent my 2 liter too. Thanks zzeeks!"}
{"text":"Have been a LOYAL Zeeks customer since we tried this place months ago. We eat out here at least once to twice per month and  tonight they just lost one of their loyal customers. We buy the entertainment books once a year to get discounts on eating out since we do it so often. We buy two at a time and we were told by the female owner that we could use our coupons at one time since we buy 2 books a year at the same time as long as we do separate orders. MIND YOU WE ONLY DO THIS ONCE A YEAR !  So tonight while my wife and I were at Chandler Fashion Place she called and placed one order and immediately called back to do the second order and was then placed on hold for over 10 minutes.   We ended up driving while still on hold from Chandler Fashion Center to the zzeeks location and walked in and ask to speak with the supervisor. We spoke to Mark who immediately looked at his phone and said no one was on hold so then we put the phone on speaker so he could hear that we were still on hold and brushed it off so nonchalantly like it was no big deal!   Then decided to give us trouble about using our coupons. Not ONE APOLOGY! Our order was done by the time we got there so then we had to wait an additional 25 minutes for a 2nd order to be placed while our first order got cold. We walked out very disappointed since this was a great place but customer service like that is just unacceptable! With this being said Jody the owner of Zzeeks has contacted me. I am so grateful to her for her sincerity. Thank you Jody, you get your  back."}
{"text":"Avoid. Went there to try out their \"huge slice and drink\" deal but what I really got was 2 slices that looked old and fake as hell. The cheese looked like gelatin and tasted like a terrible frozen pizza. I waited 15 minutes for an apparent reheated meal and the staff wasn't too welcoming either. The ranch was nasty too. If you want a decent quick slice just go to Jimmy Joe's down the street. Maybe I was just unlucky and got bad slices but a decent shop would avoid that nonsense!"}
{"text":"Came in last night and wow.  Just a great place. Super friendly staff, great environment and they even had open mic night.  I can't wait to get back from vacation so Ii can have another Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with cajun tots.    Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I had a very unpleasant experience on Valentines Day and posted a review. Jody the owner immediately reached out to me to make things right. I appreciate her willingness to rectify my experience and am happy to be back on track with this amazing pizza place in my neighborhood"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza. I wouldn't go back. My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new place but this was not good at all. We only ate 2 slices and left the rest."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of cheese curds and, perhaps pathetically, often find myself dining at a place simply because cheese curds are on the menu. This is how I stumbled upon zzeeks - an ad came by our apartment and among a variety of other things curds were on the menu. I've ordered delivery from them a few times. Their pizza is good and their curds are AWESOME! We stopped in the other day to grab a beer and curds and wanted something else too, just not pizza. We opted for \"pizza fries\". Huge mistake. Unless you like soggy fries covered, I mean drenched, in marinara skip this item. Grab an extra curd instead. Several beers on tap. Coupons in the entertainment book. Had a good selection of lunch options too. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Two of the kindest sweetest owners you will ever meet! Every single thing on the menu is delicious!! So glad they opened a second location! My daughters love it here too!!"}
{"text":"Yummm satisfying cheese pizza, delivery is fast considering the time of day I placed my order. I love how convenient it is to order while on Yelp. I recommend everyone try this place once, they have a variety of meals on the menu as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food good, but the staff is great! Even for younger people mostly working there, they were cool and efficient and kind. I love this place, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Eegeeeeeeeees! And they make it an adult Eegee if you so choose to be a lush awesome pie! And tasty wings!"}
{"text":"No doubt we spent longer on this review than the chefs spent on our order. The mac and cheese looked and tasted fresh from a box, powdered and overcooked like a store bought TV dinner. For the almost five dollars we paid for it, they could have at least served us the full box too.   The pizza was bland and clearly continued to exhibit the theme of this establishment as \"less bang for your buck\".   We would like to point out however that the cheesy bread sticks were the only decent and pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"We love this place! We are here at least once a week and have  never had a bad experience. The food is great, the place is clean  and the service is awesome! Oh and the beer is served ice cold!  The staff treats us like we are family everytime!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Just ordered for the first time tonight. The pizza is super tasty, the wings and bites are really good. I live in Tempe so it's free delivery. This place is my new go-to for beer and video game night."}
{"text":"We love Zzeeks! We have ordered delivery and eaten there frequently. Both are always wonderful. They make it very easy to order online and have some great coupons on their app. They also do a great lunch special and their prices are very reasonable. I don't think we've ever had to wait more than 25 minutes for a delivery. The staff is very friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, waits are short, staff is pretty friendly and you get a fair portion for price paid.  Not a fan of eating there (too loud), but carry out is good.  I am guessing you pretty much cant go wrong here with pizza."}
{"text":"I'm adding a new review, this time reflecting the inconsistency with our 'go to' orders (we still order quite a bit). They've never decided to add anything between the pizza and the cardboard box, so depending on how long it takes to get here, or how many veggies we get, the pizza box gets soggy in the middle and the crust loses the crisp :/ I find it better the next day because I'm not into wet pizza. There is also inconsistency with how done/overdone the pizza is. Not sure of they use a timer or what, but it's always a surprise if we get a crust that's a little chewy if it's over cooked. And most recently we were delivered a pizza with burnt to a crisp roasted red peppers (which are from a jar so they aren't roasting them and accidentally over roasting). While the manager on duty offered a credit or a new pizza, he never once apologized until the end. They sent a new pizza and it was delicious- luckily the staff that night decided to put in some extra effort on their re-do. Meanwhile, my boyfriend sent a photo to their IG with the burnt pizza and the response was that \"well it's impossible to not burn that pizza with sundried tomatoes and no cheese\" lol. Well, we didn't order sun dried tomatoes (or combo was pesto base, ricotta, roasted red pepper), and if you know a combo doesn't work for whatever reason, then tell a customer that their pizza will be burnt if they don't choose a new combo. My point, and reason for dropping a star, is that with more locations open, the quality and consistency is lacking now that the locations may not be as family operated. I won't stop ordering, because if still rather risk it and support Zzeek and Jody while I can, as opposed to Pizza Hut or Dominos, but I do hope things don't change for the worse any more."}
{"text":"Pizza is on point. Honey Citrus Pepper wings are ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and eat here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First timer.  Pizza arrived piping hot and looked tasty.  Delivery driver was super friendly.  Sausage has a great flavor!"}
{"text":"1 star for the food. It tasted like a 5$ pizza but it was so much more money. It was a new location at the time so there is a chance that someone being trained messed up on ingredients. Even if they did tho I shouldnt haven't felt so sick. Face in the toliet sick.  2 stars for service. They wanted to fix the problem and was searching for what went wrong."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. Excellent pizza and exceptional service. Bread stick bites are the best in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! I ordered the gluten free crust with pesto sauce, pepperoni and sausage. The sausage was soooo good and big pieces and the pesto had a perfect flavor. The crust had a great flavor-which can be hard to find when you want gluten free-and was cooked just right. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Zzeek's on the way home from work and I'm glad I stopped! The customer service was absolutely top notch. Followed up with some extremely good pizza and zzepolis(not sure what they are, but WOW!!!!) Barro's USED to be my favorite pizza parlor in the PHX valley but it has recently changed to Zzeek's. This place is a true mom and pop shop and is very hands on and extremely friendly and customer service driven. Thanks for the awesome food!"}
{"text":"Yummy and super cheap. There's a deal that gives you two slices and a soda for $5. The area dining area could use some upkeep, but the overall atmosphere is chill; convenient location near the college."}
{"text":"Two things are worth mentioning about this place on yelp.  The first: Eegee's.... Yes the Tucson transplants rejoice!  They have all of the flavors including the flavor of the month. I actually came in here just for that. And it was amazing to sit in Tempe and enjoy a fresh Eegee. Now because it is shipped up here you can only get a small or a medium. Don't be expecting to get a party pack. But your taste buds will thank you. If you have no idea what amazing treat I am talking about, please hurry up and get here fast to experience something Tucson has been hoarding for too long.   Second thing worth mentioning: while I was in there getting my Eegee I casually asked if they had anything gluten-free. What!? They have a gluten-free pizza... And it's 12 inches... And it's only a dollar more... And I can get any of the pizzas in gluten-free?!   I will be back to enjoy a gluten-free pizza and I will definitely edit my review after that. Come here and support a business that knows what customers want!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and the Buffalo wings are okay....but overall we enjoyed this place. The workers are very very nice."}
{"text":"Finally tried the cauliflower crust pizza!  OMG SO GOOD! I love the smaller size too.  I've always LOVED this place for the great food, exceptional service, and community involvement.  The cauliflower crust pizza gives me yet ANOTER reason to keep coming back!  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I just moved here from CA. And was wanting pizza. I called in my order the person was very friendly on the phone. Our pizza and wings got to the house before she said it would arrive so thumps up for that. I ordered a lg pizza pepperoni and pineapple that is what i like and it was my birthday so i got what i wanted. We got some wing and they where great.  The pizza flavor was good, a bit spicy for me but my husband loved it. We would order again."}
{"text":"I don't get all the rave reviews. \"Best place in Awahtukee\"...me thinks not and definitely not in Chandler! I ordered for the first time today and I am very disappointed. I was expecting really good pizza, along the standards of Spinatos. Especially when you consider the price. I rank this along the lines of Dominoes or Papa Murphy's for flavor. I ordered a thin crust pizza and it looked hand tossed to me. I can only imagine the hand tossed must be along the lines of a pan pizza. Otherwise, they got my order wrong, which is still bad. The crust is tough and lacks flavor as well. I ordered mozzarella sticks and they look like they were from the frozen section of the grocery. I was expecting a crunchy breading with italian spices in the mix. The marinara isn't flavored much with spices, which I suppose is good for old people with digestive issues. I think the marinara is part of why the pizza does not have much flavor. I really wanted to like this place, but for the price, I will stick to places that really do have thin crust and more flavor like Mod Pizza for quick pizza and Spinatos. I need to go now and drown my pizza in garlic powder and pepper. My twelve inch deluxe and mozzarella came to $23."}
{"text":"Great pizza!- ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza, well done. The crust was delicious well done. Not too seasoned- good crust. Customer service was super nice, she even gave me a coupon before checking out!, so I saved $1.50.  Clean and sporty place, if I weren't just traveling thru, I would've gone back. Oh!- and there's a patio so me my husband and two dogs enjoyed our lunch outside. She even brought me a water bowl for the pups."}
{"text":"Zzeek's has become my go to for pizza and wings.  They're fast and consist. And they have never, ever made me sick. I'm a Celiac, so I'm used to some mild discomfort after eating GF food sometimes. Not every place is great with cross contamination. Especially pizza places with flour and dough flying around.  But so far, Zzeek's has never done me wrong. That's not something I can say for Venezia's or Spinato's.  Pizza is pretty good too. Crust is tasty, and they know how to cook it just right so it's not under or overdone. And they don't skimp on the toppings.  I might have to order some. I really want pizza after writing this."}
{"text":"Delivery was in good time and the food was like it just came out of the oven (really hot).  I think they over did the cheese a little, but very tasty!  Will definitely order from there again."}
{"text":"Best pizza spot in town! All ingredients are fresh and food is not greasy!! Boneless wings and fried zucchini is awesome too. This place is our go to Friday dinner out place. :)"}
{"text":"Two reviews in one -  Dine in experience - Jody was great, customer service exceptional, great tasting food. Got a discount on another pizza when we left. They serve Eeggee's at this location, a Tucsonian favorite! Great bottle beer specials. Beware of Karaoke on certain nights. First time patrons.  5 stars  Delivery experience - overcharged for delivery. Partially my fault, but was offered a coupon by mail for a free pizza which was originally what we thought we were getting by signing up for their text-to-phone coupon flier we received. Manager did not want to offer the deal even though it said nothing on the text about dine in only. No biggie though! I doubt we will receive the coupon but I was extremely disappointed in their \"boneless wings\" which were no more than Tyson chicken nuggets with a light flavoring of med buffalo. My wife described them as chicken balls. Very chewy and I actually spit out a couple of hard pieces that I couldn't chew through. 2 stars  I think one of the biggest differences between the dine in and the delivery experience was the pizza. My wife is from Boston and the pizza during our dine in experience was very similar to Papa Gino's, a Boston favorite of hers. Our delivery pizza tasted something between Domino's and Papa Johns. Very odd to notice the difference.  Bread stick bites are great, consistent between the two!  We will most likely try Zeek's again but only dine-in.   Hope this review helps!   UPDATE: it's been two weeks and never received a voucher for our pizza. Needless to say we are a little disappointed in the lack of follow through."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizzas I've ever had. They deliver and are ALWAYS really quick. The main thing I love is how friendly everyone is. Great customer service, fast delivery, excellent food. There is no reason to go anywhere else.  That being said I only get it delivered, I've yet to go to their actual location."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, This was my first time trying Zesty Zzeeks take out or dine in. Service was fast and the ordering app on Yelp worked great. Made for a very enjoyable night in with the family. I will definately be getting Pizza from Zesty Zzeeks again. We had the large (it was huge) Pepperoni Pizza with wings. Even my picky daughter loved the pizza. Wings were big and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably delicious. The owner was spinning pie when we walked in. He gave us a menu and answered our questions. We could not help ourselves, We order a little bit of everything. The pizza sticks with marinara were melt in your mouth delicious. The marinara, made in house, is out of this world. The pizza is also filled with fresh ingredients and baked to perfection, crispy without tasting like a cracker. The crust taste is divine as well.  Now onto dessert. We had the cookie with ice cream and the cinnamon sticks. All way too good. The owner came over to talk to us about what we thought. We quickly asked if he could open a store in Albuquerque. He laughed and said in 4 years he hoped he could. He has a plan and a great product. I can't wait until he comes to New Mexico. For now we will plan to visit him when ever in Arizona.   His marinara is the best we have had in years. We talked him into selling us a gallon of it take home. We have had a blast dipping bread, making pasta, and putting it on our own pizza. It is sweet and a little spicy all at the same time.   Stop by and give this guy a try! Greatest pizza and food!"}
{"text":"We gave this place a try twice because of gift certificates from my employer. Mediocre prices at best. No real deals.  Pizza was sub par. Dough was not cooked enough, not enough sauce. Cheese was cheap and chewy, similar to chain joints.  Prices on the paper menu were not the same as the over head menu and the prices we were charged where higher than both of the listed menu prices.  I was told they had recently changed their prices. But in reality they did not change their prices they simply started charging people more. None of their prices had been updated and when I inquirws why i was not charged menu prices I was not offered any discounts or compensation.  Move along, this is not the pizzeria you are looking for."}
{"text":"I visited Zesty Zzeeks twice within a week.  The first time I went there, I was craving cheese curds.  I wouldn't recommend them.  They were small and not cheesy like most places in the surrounding area.  I really wanted to like them, but it was a NO for me.  The second time I visited, my sister and I ordered the pizza and fried zucchini.  The pizza was decent.  Large slices.  The fried zucchini was WONDERFUL.  It was so good we had to order a second order.  As always, it's best to eat fried foods fresh so that you can really enjoy them.  I'm a fan and we will be back."}
{"text":"There are a number of good pizza places in the area. So, I wasn't necessarily looking for another one. However, my kids really wanted to try this place so we decided to give it a try. That was a couple months ago, and we have now been there three times. Obviously, we love it!  You should be aware that the sauce they use on the pizza is a little spicy. We had the opportunity to talk with the owner/chef and he mentioned that they do make it and they used to make it even spicier. We like spice so it is great.  The breadsticks are a must-try. They are small and bite-sized so you end up with more of the crunchy ends. And they do not skimp on the seasoning like a lot of other places do with their breadsticks.  Finally, make sure you save some room for dessert. The zzepoles are awesome. Basically, they are fried balls of pizza dough with powdered sugar. They are surprisingly light.  If you are in the area, I would definitely recommend checking ZZeek's out. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Thank you Zesty Zzeke's for being open Christmas day. You and your staff really were hustling and feeding the crowds. Dinner was delicious! Tried the deep dish. Oh so good. Tried the cheesy bread sticks. Wow!! Excellent staff and food."}
{"text":"I got a $25 Groupon and was able to use it to pick up my food. I ordered a chicken pesto pizza with salt/pepper wings through the company's webpage. The order was ready within the 15-minute window as stated on the e-mail confirmation.  It's been a couple years since I last visited this place and there have been improvements with service time and now there's delivery. I like the taste of the food and will come back again."}
{"text":"This place was not good at all. We went in at 2 pm on a Sunday. The place was pretty empty so we figured we would at least good service but received average service (below average at the end). We ordered traditional and boneless wings and a pizza. The traditional wings were literally the size of my pinky and the flavor was almost non existent. Another reviewer mentioned the boneless wings were frozen Tyson brand and I believed it to be a joke, not anymore. The dough and crust couldn't decide if it was a thin crust or traditional and wasn't chewy or crispy, it was just there. The chicken on the pizza was obviously frozen, probably also Tyson. The cheese was your typical flavorless rubberized mozzarella and even though the pesto was supposedly homemade, they put so little on there was little to no discernable pesto flavor. The tomato sauce had way too much oregano for my liking and was about the only thing I could taste on the Hawaiian pizza. The ham was pretty gross, it was slimy and didn't crisp up like I'm used to. We ordered enough to have leftovers and at the end of it all we didn't end up taking it home with us. The server said she'd bring a box and after waiting 5 minutes in an empty restaurant with still no box we just left. So there's the food and service critique, now let's talk about the actual establishment. Simply put the restaurant was not clean.  When we arrived there were multiple tables that hadn't been cleared and stayed that way for the entire duration of our visit. The floors were dirty, our napkin dispenser was covered in dust, all the glass in the place was covered in fingerprints and dirty, and overall the place just seemed and felt dirty. The worst part of it all is the fact that this place is expensive. We went on 60¢ wing day but they were so small that it may have been a worse deal then a normally priced wings at any other place. To sum things up, even though this place wasn't offensive to every sense, there isn't any area of this experience I could say was above average. Save yourself and your family the trouble and go to Oregano's up the street."}
{"text":"Zzeeks is one of the best around Ahwatukee when it comes to a thin crust pie, wings and we love the bread dots. Customer service is also great here. We get the Bone-in-deal."}
{"text":"I've had pizzas, salads, and various other items delivered to my door. All have been good. My favorite is the salad and meatballs. My nephew likes the pizzas and meatball subs, although he cannot eat the sub that often (allergic to nickel and wheat has a lot of it) so Ive just been getting the meatballs by themselves, which is great that its an option. I also eat keto but have my cheat days and enjoy a  house salad  & meatball dish every week."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to wander into this place early in the day, and nobody else was there yet. The owner was talking to us about the place as we looked over the menu and we ended up ordering just a few slices. She knew it was our first time so she gave us a whole pizza so we could take some home. Great food! I was sad to have moved too far away from my favorite place in Gilbert, but Zzeeks really filled the void for us.  I wouldn't bother with the mozzarella sticks or other fried stuff, and the wings aren't great either (a little soggy), but the pizza is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ordered with east24... Food was delivered in a timely manner, however the $2.50 worth of extras that I ordered never made it to my pizza ... But still giving them at least a 3 star since the pizza was pretty good, even without my extras....  Update: Ed from Zeeks reached out to me and offered to remake the pizza correctly or send me a coupon. I was very impressed with their willingness to correct the situation. Based on that I have decided to modify my review and give them a 4 star rating. As I said earlier, even though the pizza didn't have my extras it still tastes pretty good. So cheers to them for being very customer oriented. If I'm in the area again I'll definitely eat at Zeeks or get one of their pizzas delivered again..."}
{"text":"We were in town for Spring Training and the kids wanted to have pizza...we're glad we found some deliciousness!  The breadstick bites were so soft and tasty - the BEST we've ever had! We also ordered the deluxe pizza with artichokes and the classics kid's favorite -  cheese.  The whole family was very pleased and raved about the great service and excellent food! We're glad we found this family friendly gem!"}
{"text":"I will never again order from large chain pizzerias. ..Wow, I am beyond impressed. Pizza was great and the wings were perfectly crispy and not soggy at all as most delivery wings usually end up. I also ordered an Eegees and it was frozen, not slightly melted. Delivery was fast and delivery person double checked my credit card which I appreciate. 100% recommended!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered chicken wings, breadsticks, and cheese sticks. The woman who helped me on the phone was extremely polite and went over all of the options with me since I hadn't looked at the menu before calling. The food was delivered very quickly and she had given the driver an extra menu and coupons for me. The food was delicious. I had a great experience today."}
{"text":"Came in tonight after a Boy Scout hike and we needed a good place to eat and hike hideout. Tim was fantastic from the moment we walked in. He gave us  % of attention. We usually would have gone to Barros but decided to try something new. From the brew, pizza, garlic bread and dessert we definitely will come back. We live past the foothills, but a good carry out place to pick up and pair with a fun wine . Ask for Tim if your looking for a smiley  face. Thank you for a great first impression."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best pizzas I've ever tasted, from the crust to the sauce to the toppings. Excellent atmosphere.  they even let you write (with dry erase marker) on the wall)  How cool is that.  This will definitely be one of our regular places.  P.S.  TV's to watch sports too.  Many +++++ positives.  Too bad all the positive rating are filtered.  Because they ARE AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location about three times. Every single time the people are incredibly nice. The pizza is the best I've had in Arizona, you can taste how fresh their ingredients are; I could never order from papa murphys or any other chain for that matter. Eegees are incredible, their pizza is always perfect, but the guy did talk about these small fried dough pieces you dip so naturally the next time I ordered I got them. Nothing too special, lots of sugar and sweetness but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! The pizza is amazing and the staff is always upbeat & helpful. Want to give a shout out to Nate(i'm pretty sure that's what his name was) and the other staff members for helping us jump start our car today in the 110 degree heat..!! You guys are the best!! Will definitely continue to come back and tell everyone we know to support you guys!!"}
{"text":"While everyone else was shopping on Friday morning, Mr. M and I got up early and cleaned the entire house, did some yard work, dug out the Christmas lights, untangled the Christmas lights, argued over where to put said lights, and finally called it a morning.  By the time Zzeeks opened, we were waiting outside like a couple of junkies, starving and thinking about wings and pizza and beer.  We had earned it.  This was our first time here, and I had purchased a $25 Groupon as well.  There was one other chick in the place, and she got her food to go and then we had the place all to ourselves.  We started with 10 of the bone-in wings ($7.99), honey citrus pepper flavor, and ordered a couple of beers.  We were feeling the holiday spirit and tried the Leinenkugel Snowdrift vanilla porter ($2.50).  It's a good beer (Breckenridge's vanilla porter is better), but wasn't the best choice with our food.  Should have gotten a lager or something.  I didn't look too closely, but it looked like they had 6 or 7 beers on tap, mostly from Four Peaks and San Tan.    The wings were delicious!  The sauce was a little sweet and a little spicy.  Really enjoyed those and will order them again for sure.  Then I ordered the 12\" Philly cheesesteak pizza ($15.99) and Mr. M ordered a calzone with sausage ($7.99).  I have to thank the other yelpers who took pics of the Philly pizza.  That is a great pie!  Great cheesesteak flavor and nice crust.  Not thin and not too thick.  A perfect pizza for sure.    We also enjoyed the calzone.  My husband loves a good calzone and many times they are huge, thick monsters full of cheese.  All good, but this thinner one at Zzeeks was great too.  The sausage was nicely blended with the cheese and I like whatever seasoning and cheese they sprinkle on the top.  Perfect again.  The total with tax before the Groupon was $39.96.  Even if we would not have had the Groupon, I would have been happy with the food and the price.  Great food and service all around!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pizza and boneless wings are always great. Delivery is always on time as well. Awesome food and excellent prices."}
{"text":"Wings are crispy and flavorful.  Great pizza and awesome service. We love this place."}
{"text":"The owner had contacted me and asked to come back so she could personally remake my order. It was well cooked and tasty, will definitely be back. Thanks for the great pizza and customer service"}
{"text":"Ordered online a ton of food and must say being an out of towner from Nashville, this is some of the best pizza, wings and some type of funnel cake balls that were insane. Arrived on time and highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing new little hidden gem!!!! Best beer specials & bomb wings! super cool staff too & tv screens everywhere. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of cauliflower pizza crust but it was excellent. Can't wait to try all the types of pizza. BBQ Chicken was the best I've had."}
{"text":"I like to order from local businesses, but I'm also feeding two growing kids and have to live on a budget. Zzeeks is reasonably priced, good quality, and I can feel good about not supporting some out of state pizza baron."}
{"text":"Really yummy pizza and wings. The staff is very friendly. The Karaoke night on Fridays was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Food was good but the coupon from Yelp wasn't honored.  It was a $10 off that stated to show it to a manager or an employee.  I called the store looking to get the $10 clipped off at the start (credit card order) but they stated it was \"carry out only.\"  Didn't say that anywhere on the offer - driver repeated the same thing.  I tried.  Anyway, nothing wrong with the pizza - hot and it was pretty good.  Nothing earth shattering.  I've ordered pizza twice since then - Spinelli's and Venezia's.  Comparable pizza and I spent less on both places."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! I just had their BBQ pizza. It was an excellent tasting pizza. Their service was nice and pricing reasonable."}
{"text":"Saw they won an award so gave it a try. The pizza was a little spicy, but not hot. It was good. Not bad, but not awesome either. Not sure about the top pizza award.  Seemed to be run by teenagers when we walked in. No one to greet us right away when we walked in.  Not sure if I'd be back."}
{"text":"Honestly.. zzeeks is ok. The pizza is expensive and it definitely has some good qualities too it. The sauce is pretty good along with the garlic bread. I mainly get the all meat pizzas which I mean the meat is good. The only reason why I have given this place a 4 would be the price.  It's pricey."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for a looooong time!  This place is great!  Everyone is very polite, the food is awesome and the owners are terrific!  The pizza is always good, the wings, sandwiches and fried mac-n-cheese are the best!  Can't beat a Blue Moon with a big chunk of orange in it either!  When we want pizza, we get Zzeeks!!!  Great family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The food and service were fantastic! A great place for the kids! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just ate a Zzeeks for the first time today.  Was driving around trying to find places around my work for lunch and gave it a try.  I was really surprised when I opened the door to find a very clean, stylish restaurant.  I got the slice and wings combo, both were really good.  Staff was super friendly, and you can get a beer also!  A few tables left while I was there and they promptly cleaned the tables ASAP.  Nice feeling to eat somewhere that obviously cares about cleanliness.  I can't think of a single reason not to recommend this pleasant surprise pizza joint.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Nice and clean restaurant with great food and great service! Large servings of ranch and you get more than 1 tiny stick of celery with your wings (it's the little things. :) Will definitely be returning customers!!"}
{"text":"I ordered bone-less wings but I got bone-in wings :( I hate them but everything else was.  UPDATE: They contacted me and got me a free order of bone-less wings, YAY!"}
{"text":"Driving from Los Angeles to Tucson. Found this place because it was kind of close to the freeway. It was worth the slight detour. So glad we stopped here! All the food was delicious! They make the basic pepperoni pizza taste scrumptious! I recommend the Caribbean Style wings and a side of breadsticks. Jodi was welcoming and attentive. Thank you, this is just what we needed after a long drive!!!!"}
{"text":"Although I had to remind them to cook and bring out the rest of my meal I was extremely happy with the slice of pie that I ordered it was pretty good. The ranch dressing was wonderful with the fried zucchini and after I put some parmesan on the French fries they were perfect. I'm not sure when but I'll definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"We have been trying to find a good pizza place,  so we tried out Zeeks based on the good reviews. I'm not sure I buy all of the 5 star reviews.  I got their Beast pizza, and my wife had the Pesto Chicken. My pizza was just average at best,  and my wife said the same thing. I would put it on par with Papa Johns, but much more expensive. The search for great pizza continues."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza delivered fast! Crust is yummy as heck!!! The Beast is just that...A Beast!  I toss a box weekly...oops"}
{"text":"I truly do not understand how folks rate this place so highly let alone the best pizza in Ahwatukee.  You must have no taste buds and a shame since most folks are transplants from bigger citys that have REAL pizza.  I have ordered from here on a few occasions always hoping to get a better pie.  Today was my last.  Ordered a large sausage with half black olives and mushrooms and some wings. $40 with tip - could get a much better pizza from Rosattis, Bella Italia or Nellos for that cost.  There were such little toppings it was pathetic but gobs of cheese. I would have to say it was less than a cup of sausage on the entire pizza. We ordered thin crust which is never cooked right, always soggy in the middle and only crusty on the ends.  If you are looking for a good pizza go to Nello's, Rosati, Bella Italia.  I'm all for supporting local chains but you guys need to fix your product."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan: we have given them three tries ordering through Eat24 - even though we hated the pizza back in February - and yesterday out of an order of $46+, only the boneless wings and salad were edible.   The Chicken Philly had less than 3oz of tiny, cubed chicken, hardly any cheese, and was on burnt bread; the entire sandwich took on the scorched flavor. Scott's meatball parmigiana sando had little to no mozzarella (subbed out for provolone on menu) on stale garlic bread with no marinara, and oddly, sautéed mushrooms?! I hate wasting food, but mine went into the trash, Scott was starving and ate his.   Jody the owner was prompt to offer to replace the sandwiches, and is very nice; I declined. However, since we've had 2/3 experiences with inedible food, including items we had before which were now bad, we will not order again. I'm not a person who accepts free food, or invites from management to \"come back in and we will make it better\" instead, we revisit anonymously to have an average customer experience.   Being community minded volunteers ourselves, we commend this location for their involvement in charitable endeavors, but consistency, pride in what the kitchen sends out, and good, edible product is paramount in the food service industry.   We wish them well, and hope everyone who enjoys their food, keeps supporting them. I'm done."}
{"text":"There was a small mishap with  our  delivery  order, and the manager,  Jodi, was on top of it.  She was very communicative and kind.  The food, as always,  is good."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings! Had medium and honey bbq  they were good I would recommend to order extra crispy. Groupon for 17 dollars for 30 worth of food."}
{"text":"Ryan and kristie are awesome.   I called and said I needed one of there lunch deals (Big slice of pizza and a drink) to bring to my girlfriend on her lunch break. She loves pizza and eegees and Ryan said, what kind do you want I'll make sure to have it ready.    When I got there Kristie was awesome, very professional and courteous.   Ever time I come here the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great midrange pizza! Not gourmet but not chintzy either. Definitely a new favorite for that. However I wish they carried more toppings. I'm also not really impressed with their wings or desserts. That stuff isn't bad but it doesn't stand out. Great pizza though!"}
{"text":"The most friendliest owners who make amazing food!! I love coming here! I recommend the cheese crisp. So good!"}
{"text":"Zzeek's is my absolute favorite pizza place. When I order pizza, it's always from them. Their prices are reasonable, their customer service is great, and their food is delicious. Every interaction I've ever had with their employees has been positive, from the people answering the phone and taking orders to the delivery drivers. I love their barbecue chicken pizza so much I could write a sonnet about it, and I just might."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were drawn by the 4 star rating and sign saying it was the \"1st place best of 2014\". So walking in our expectations were high.   First impression: prices are -$$$$- and the place was a bit dirty; we had to decide which table was the least messy to eat at.   We ordered 1 fountain drink cup, a 20 inch Hawaiian pizza, 10 honey hot and 10 medium wings. The total came out to be over 30$.   Overall the food was okay. Definitely not the best pizza and wings, more like mediocre. The wings were tiny  and the sauce was average. The honey hot was more like honey bbq and the medium was definitely mild. The pizza was thin crust, but not crispy enough. They put huge slices of ham? on the pizza and the pineapple seemed old. Their fountain drink selection is limited (their brewed teas were just water), I wish I had just gotten a water cup instead.   Also, beware, it seems to be a high school hangout spot. It seemed like the whole senior class was there and the cashier couldn't have been more excited.   Overall, we probably won't be coming again. The price is too high for the atmosphere and taste."}
{"text":"We visited the Warner Rd. location. Zeek happened to be there. He has the friendliest personality. The food was amazing. We had the pizza and meatball sub. Awesome find!!!"}
{"text":"BBQ wing so yummy!  Deluxe pizza yummy!  Ordered for delivery, it came in about 30 minutes.."}
{"text":"Came in late and hungry from hawaii and asked front desk if there was any pizza delivery ( didn't have a car). We decided to try this pizza over dominoes and glad we did. It's really delicious. After two pieces I knew I should stop but just had to take another bite before putting it away. If we were here longer I would try something else . service was really good, delivery was fast.rated only four stars because only tried one kind off pizza.  We had a pep & mush. Good amount of toppings and cheese."}
{"text":"I love this place. We drive across town to eat here. Our food is always amazing and hot. The staff is so friendly and helpful. They made it a point to learn my name and they remember what our favorite pizza is. Best place in the area."}
{"text":"Hmm.......4 1/2 star pizza place in Gilbert? You can throw a rock in any direction in this town and hit a pizza place. I was too drawn in by the rating. With all the build your own pizza places popping up in the city, I was expecting to be wowed. Sadly I wasn't.   My first hint was it was empty on a Saturday night at 6pm. I hate that you have to order from a counter then sit down, who do I tip? Counter girl? The 2 different guys that brought me my food? I'm confused. I dislike this system. I dislike having to get my own beverage. It's like 1/2 fast food, 1/2 casual dining.   Our appetizer was good, it was just fried cheese. Chicken wings were weird. The breading wasn't crispy, it was soggy. Just a weird texture to a wing. Good size and good sauce, I did not like the breading. Pizza was........just...........o..k. Not a single negative thing, but not a positive thing I can say either.  I don't get the star rating. Apparently there's like 3 or more of these places, so I guess they do well, and I'm a strong local business supporter, but good luck to you all."}
{"text":"Pizza crust was good. We got the extreme pepperoni, I felt it was too salty. Maybe it was the three different types of pepperoni... Should have just done reg pepperoni. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food. Need to widen delivery service but no complaints. Love Friday night karaoke. Such a fun place"}
{"text":"Yummy! This place is really ruining my diet! Grrr! Haha. Dessert is even better than the pizza. Delivery guys are friendly and fast!!  $15 dollar minimum BEFORE added tax kind of stinks, especially when you're off by $. 02 and have to add something just to get delivery."}
{"text":"My husband and I always order the wings and pizza. Comes out perfect each time!! Definitely better pizza then Pizza Hut, dominos etc."}
{"text":"Gave this a place a shot due to the Groupon.   I ordered the Ed's Spicy Buffalo Chicken pizza, Boneless wings, and Bread sticks. The bread sticks should be called bread knots, but they were extremely delicious.   Ed's Spicy Buffalo Chicken Pizza was extremely tasty, make sure to get it with the ranch on it and not on the side!  The wings were alright (not a must have like the pizza and bread sticks.)  The restaurant was extremely clean and the service was excellent!   I cant want to try some of the other pizza selections!"}
{"text":"From my 8 year old:   I had Zzeeks Pizza a few nights ago with my friends. I ordered Cheese and Pepperoni Pizza. I liked the taste of the cheese pizza because it's my favorite type of pizza! I've been to other pizza places but I like Zzeeks is one of my favorite pizza places because it taste delicious! -Ash"}
{"text":"Go and eat here! The food was phenomenal. My boyfriend, an avid pepperoni fan declared their pepperoni extreme pizza the best he's ever had. My calzone was impeccable. The servers took care of an issue within minutes. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Zesty Zzeeks and I would give 10 stars if I could.  We had planned to go in but couldn't so we had an order delivered.  The online order system was easy to use and they offer so many options.  I can't say enough how tasty the pizza and cheese bread was.  According to my husband the wings are awesome. The delivery time was spot on and the deliveryman was super friendly and not impatient.  I'm thrilled that we now have a place close to where we live that I know we will get great service via delivery and based on all reviews great service if we dine in."}
{"text":"Love this little local place. The food is so so good, they have great craft beers on tap, the vibe is so friendly. My go to is pizza and wings. Supporting local is the best way to go and this place has my support!"}
{"text":"Loved the deluxe pizza!!!! Had that for dinner on my last night in tempe. It was delivery and when it got there it was still nice and hot and very tasty"}
{"text":"Great mom and pop still place. The smoked meats are incredible and the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Ordered online (so simple) order was ready when I got there 15 minutes later and the Deluxe pizza & meatball sandwich were amazing!  I love that their sauce has a little kick to it.   My meatball sub was more than one person can possibly consume. I think there were 10 meatballs on it and the sauce came separate so I could sauce according to my liking.   The pizza which I call a supreme had tons of fresh toppings and comes on a light and airy crust that's crunchy too....I could eat it all day long.   Bonus....if you haven't tried an Eegee, make sure you do. Lemon/strawberry combo is delicious.   There's nothing about this order to go that I didn't like. It's a bit warm in the restaurant for me but I wasn't staying."}
{"text":"Love the double chicken cheese pizza. Super delicious simple healthy pizza decision! Everything is above par and this is my alternative top choice to Grimaldis."}
{"text":"I'm utterly impressed. I brought my daughter and her friends for a birthday lunch and the pizza was amazing. The price was right. Owner came out to greet us and shared some of her secrets of the amazing sauce. I will definitely be back for lunch and wifi!! We now have a new great place to eat."}
{"text":"We ordered wings, fried pickles and the bread sticks. First and foremost, the breadsticks were DELICIOUS!!! I would absolutely get those every time. However, the wings seemed to be overly breaded, fried and they were awkwardly soggy. I did not enjoy them whatsoever. Obviously this is a pizza joint, but I was surprised by the lack of execution on an easy dish like the chicken wings. Also, the fried pickles were disgusting, as they were  overly breaded and fried as well. Did not have a taste to them (I'm a HUGE fried pickle fan).   Based on the breadsticks- I imagine the pizza must be their specialty. We will try the pizza next time, but certainly will never order the pickles or wings again.   We also got 6 Dr Peppers which were $1 a pop - just an fyi"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but the Eegees are amazing! Love this place"}
{"text":"This location is awesome! There's two locations, Awhatukee and Tempe, and Tempe location is dope. Ed is the man and makes sure he takes care of his customers. They make fresh slices for you if they don't have any. Takes like 10 minutes to get slices, and they hook it up with pepperoni. Check out the Tempe location with my dude Ed, he's the man."}
{"text":"Love this place came in to take the kids for a treat and come to find out this little gen caters to all!  Food for the kids, hubby and the picky stomach like mine!  They have gluten free dough and double high GF dough. They also have vegan cheese!!!!! Totally pigged out on not guilty good with my family. Will be back soon! Thank you guys for taking care of me and my fam!"}
{"text":"I TOO HAD A EASY BAKE OVEN!! Can I open a restaurant too?! Funny how it tastes so similar! While strangely nostalgic, I've long since outgrown rubbery, tasteless pizza. Though customers have the ability to draw on the walls and young children are playing with the food behind the counter, this is sadly not chucky cheese. Sorry Zzeek's but I'd rather visit my cousins playroom for more packaged tasting food. At least she knows customer service.  Honestly though, I was not at all impressed with this restaurant. The pizza looked nothing like the picture. The crust was hard and frozen tasting, while the shriveled and sparse toppings slid right off the greasy elastic-like cheese.    The blonde child behind the counter was a bit rude and talked loudly about me and my brother in front of us. It took us forever to get any sort service! I know family comes first, but it's a bit ridiculous when I'm waiting to pay, and everyone is in the back chatting and laughing it up. It's a bit sad when McDonalds has you beat at service. A, \"Hello welcome to Chucky Ch- I mean Zzeeks family own pizza factory\" would have been nice!   I could go on and on about the service, the children working behind the counter, the overpriced food, the lack of pizza boxes that don't fall apart, and much much more.   If you want to find out for yourself what a horrid place this is, be my guest! It's an entertaining place to be :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza! this coming from a Sicilian :) I got the cheese calzone with provolone, cheese bread an the zzepoles (donut like pastries).  They were on time and everything was hot and fresh. Yum!"}
{"text":"Truck was at the mechanic so I ordered from zesty Zeeks some Onion, Mushroom and Pepperoni pizza . It was delivered quickly and was alright but a little soggy in the middle. Garlic Bread was delicious with ranch and was my favorite item. Price delivered was about 30 with everything. Great place for Pizza in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Awatukee!! Owners are amazing.  Great family place!!! AAAAAANNNNND .60 cent wings on Sunday!!!"}
{"text":"I love their gluten free pizza. The crust is thin and crispy. I tried the carribean chicken tenders and they were great too."}
{"text":"Messed up order completely, called to let them know. They said they would come back and at least give us what they forgot but nobody ever showed up. Decided to go ahead and pick stuff off and make due with what we got. Pizza was luke warm at time of delivery and had to nuke by the time we ate it. Will seek other alternatives next time."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place I was impressed by their great tasting pizza and wings. It's a family owned spot with super kind employees. They definitely go above and beyond for their customers. I took my order to go, but they have a welcoming ambiance. TV's galore.  They have great lunch specials too. If you stop by this place it'll become one of your new fav spots."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Super disappointed. Ordered a 12\" well done pizza. It looked good in the box but it was ridiculously soggy underneath. The crust was super drenched.   I order from Zestys a lot. They normally make a decent pizza. I can't even finish the rest of it, the texture is like moosh.   They totally dropped the ball this time. -------------------- UPDATED REVIEW --------------------  The owner Jody was kind enough to reach out to me with apologies and offered to replace my order. The replaced pizza was delivered free of charge and was PERFECT!   Thank you Jody for caring about the satisfaction of your customers!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a great pizza place in Ahwatukee and we finally found one! Great pizza and wings! My husband is a wing \"snob\" and he LOVED the Medium and Caribbean wings! Great service as well. Thank you Zzeeks!!!"}
{"text":"We had pizza and wings and they were fantastic. Flavorful sauce and crust. Wings were super tasty. Cold beer on tap and bottled. They also have dippin' dots and Eegees!!"}
{"text":"We ended up not too far from here, and there was a restaurant.com certificate, so we decided to give it a try.  The place wasn't busy.  It's in a smallish shopping center.  The guy behind the counter was busy despite us being only the second couple there.  But he was friendly enough, answered a few questions.  We ordered a deluxe pizza.  You order and pay at the counter, and then go sit down.    It took maybe 20 minutes but the pizza showed up hot and smelling pretty good.  And it was pretty good!  The staff also were nice enough to get some garlic powder and oregano (their shakers only had chili flakes and parmesan).  Many places would just say \"we don't have that, sorry\", but these guys said they could make it happen.  Kudos for the customer service.  I pondered the rating for this place.  The pizza was probably 3.5 stars.  Pretty good.  Not as good as some, but pretty good.  I could have it again in the future.  I don't think it was 4-star good, but because the staff was so helpful I think they deserve my rounding up to 4.  Good customer service should be rewarded.  The restaurant.com certificate made this a good value, too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and pizza was very good. Atmosphere is clean and establishment is very well kept!  Will recommend as well as eat here again. Looking forward to some other dishes as the pictures look amazing."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are hard to please foodies from California, and we have found our absolute FAVORITE pizza and wing joint. As if the actual food isn't enough, the customer service is what absolutely blows it out of the water. We are very frequent orderers (I blame it on being 8 months pregnant) and they never disappoint. We got the wrong crust on a pizza and they sent the driver back with the correct order, no questions asked. Integrity and real customer dedication is so hard to come by and we feel so lucky to have found this place! I would recommend this place a million times over and will definitely be a family staple! Thank you Zeeks!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken Parmesan sandwich and waited - took a while. Finally asked the server if that was my sandwich on the shelf. He said oh yeah that's it, drove home open the sandwich to my surprise it was diced grilled chicken with cup of Parmesan sauce.   Extremely lame....... drove back to the store another 20 minutes got my money back without an apology or anything. Won't be going there anymore... Comment below is not true."}
{"text":"Service is a bit sluggish, but pizza and wings were good, particularly the chicken pesto pizza and lime wings. Also a decent selection of beers on tap, so definitely worth going to for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This was quite possibly the worst pizza I've ever had. The chicken wings were so salty we had to peel off the outer shell to eat them. The salad was the hit of the meal. it really was very good.  We did not get the Parmesan cheese as requested and we were loaded up with Forks without any knives. Other than the very nice delivery person there would be no good reason to ever order from this place"}
{"text":"Last Friday was my first time at this restaurant and I was amazingly pleased.  My friend and I both had Philly Cheese steaks and my daughter had pasta and it was all very generous and extremely delicious!  The atmosphere was warm and laid back and we won't hesitate to eat here again in the near future."}
{"text":"Went here and ordered a Sandwich, breadsticks and got Cajun tater tots on the side. I also opted for something new to me which is the zeppoles. Took sometime to get these things as I'm sure the items had to cook an took sometime to complete. Afterwards though the food was hot an tasted great. The Cajun tater tots I would recommend as well as the breadsticks. The sandwhich was ok just a little to greasy but overall great food. This was my first time going so the Zeppoles I would recommend as well. They are little balls that consist of powder sugar and icing inside the cup they put ranch dip in. The kids loved them. Overall a great place to go to if your looking for good food made to order."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, wings and breadsticks! The Eegees was perfect! Terrific locally owned establishment! Pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Ahwatukee.  Also, mom & pop place which we all need to support!!!  Go check it out next time you want good pizza pie!"}
{"text":"always keep me updated with the flavor of the month. thats key. i appreciate you."}
{"text":"Honestly I really love the food here. Sometimes the chicken is dry, but not a big deal.   My only complaint is that they always seem to get my order wrong. I ordered delivery and they added an extra jalapeño poppers to my order. I ordered a spicy BBQ pizza and got buffalo chicken. I didn't call back to complain since I didn't want to make a big deal out of things, but it is pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Loved the cauliflower pizza crust!!!  Tastes like a nice crispy thin crust..so yummy. We have tried the Hawaiian pizza, beast, veggie, and bbq chicken pizza and have loved them all. We also tried the cheese curds, they were good not the best I have ever had but good. We will make this one of our regular restaurants from now on. Excited to try other things on the menu I don't think we will be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Awesome family Karaoke on Friday nights! As in, not a bar, and definitely a place where kids who love to sing can come and participate. Adults tend to let the kids take center stage.   The pizza is hit or miss. What really pulls this place together is that the people are super nice and make you feel at home. You can watch them make the pizzas which is an added bonus. You can get different flavors on the same pizza (we ordered 3 kinds on a large and they accommodated it). One out of the three tasted awesome - the other two were ho hum."}
{"text":"Love the variety of gluten free pizzas they offer. We have an allergy to gluten in our house so when the kids want pizza I'm glad that they have choices. We can't have dairy either so def need to start ordering from them with out dairy"}
{"text":"Most freaking awesome cauliflower pizza !!!!! Keto friendly !! I've tested two days after with ketone stripes and still was in ketosis after having the whole pizza. I treat myself to this ever two weeks!! You seriously cannot even tell!! Thank you for this keto option! I hope y'all come up with more !!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot to get wings on sundays, 50 cents ea.  More than 15 different flavors too!"}
{"text":"We get delivery from here about once a week or so. They are faster than any other delivery and the drivers are extremely friendly.  Food- we love the chicken pesto pizza. Thin crust is crispy, toppings are very fresh. Cauliflower crust is good too. Appetizers: Zucchini is yummy"}
{"text":"I can't understand where the good reviews are coming from, the employees were pretty friendly, but other than that the pizza was mediocre at best. They gave me about the smallest side of Ranch in existence when I asked for it, and we couldn't be on their patio with beer for some reason. Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Really great place. Nice lunch deals with a slice and wings. Pizza was delicious and my wife's Philly cheesesteak was good too. Good prices, especially for the lunch deals. Boneless wings were different (breading I think) but had good flavor."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery today and was excited since I had had their pizza and wings before and loved them but was very disappointed in both, can't believe I paid almost $50 for it. The wings were tiny and dry, didn't even seem to have any sauce on them at all so I was glad to have purchased extra sauce or else these would have been inedible.  The pizza was just average, if that. It reminded me of pizza that was reheated after a day of sitting out even though it was just made. Also ordered one order of bone in wings and one of boneless but relieved two orders of bone in. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I just ordered from here for the first time using yelp. I wanted to surprise my husband because I had been in the hospital and hes been taking care of me full-time for a week. Its my husband first day back to work and I wanted to surprise him with lunch. I placed the order knowing it would be there before his lunch even with the 45-60min delivery window. The confirmed delivery time was 1:30 great his lunch is at 2pm. The food was delivered over an hour late and inedible. When I called they said they had 6 deliveries at once which is why it is taking so long. So his food just drove around in someones car for who knows long. The pizza fries were hard and disgusting, mac and cheese bites were soggy, and the cheese steak followed suit it all went in the trash. We will not be ordering from here ever again."}
{"text":"My family and I have tried all of the pizza delivery places in Ahwatukee over the last 8 years of living here.  This is the first one that my kids and  I can actually agree on. We ordered a 20\" pepperoni with black olives and pineapple.  While that may be a boring pizza compared to what they offer on the menu, it was what we were all craving at the time. It was promised, via web, to be delivered in approximately 25 minutes.The delivery driver was right on time and friendly. We enjoyed a slight banter while we signed the tab and he was on his way. The pizza covered an area the size of our range top.  When we opened it up, it was beautiful.  There was an abundance of toppings, they did not skimp and we wouldn't have had to order the extra pepperoni that we did. As for the taste... the most important part of this review: it was amazing. We enjoyed every bite and can't waif for the cold version tomorrow at breakfast."}
{"text":"Hipster beardie employee had no smiles nor f**ks to give tonight, apparently.  Without some kind of music playing the place was oppressively quiet, and this place is clearly a sports bar--so that was weird.  Despite the exciting menu (cheeseburger pizza, Philly cheesesteak pizza, etc) and promising price tag ($20.99 average for 16\" pizza), the pizza was so-so.  And I mean like Domino's so-so.  We also had the fried pickles; not bad but not great.  Overall it wasn't bad, but for $35 for a pizza, a couple drinks and a small side, not worth more than two stars.  Save some money and pick up Domino's."}
{"text":"OMG this place is awesome!! The service is GREAT. Right when you come in the door they are saying hi and how are you. Now the food MMM.  Soo the pizza is great we ordered the vegetarian with Jalapeño and it was delicious . My man did not like the  ricotta on it but after he took it off he was very please. We also ordered the buffalo wings hot and they were VERY CRISPY AND THE SAUCE WAS THE BEST I've ever had and the beer is served in a fixed pitcher with frozen glasses. Ed was the one that served us and Christian is the one that made our pizza and Honestly they are really awesome people that know High Quality Hospitality. The owner is very lucky to have people like that working for him."}
{"text":"We love Zzeeks!  Great Pizza, great dessert!  Wings are great too!  We have ordered pick up many times.  Tonight when our order was a bit over done zzeeks not only gave us the well done pie, but also a perfect pie along with garlic bites , our desert and soda while we waited.  AND they had karaoke going with some really great singers!  Way to make an honest mistake right folks!"}
{"text":"Zzeeks is one of my favourite spots to eat in Ahwatukee. Their boneless wings are pretty good and the pizza isn't too bad either. My favourite thing about the place is the hang out. It's decorated pretty cool and has a really good vibe. We went there on a Friday and was pleasently surprised that they had karaoke on. Whilst I won't hold the standard of vocalists against Zzeeks I have to say it was very entertaining.   Will definitely be coming here to hang out and have a slice of pizza with a beer soon. Honestly, beer seems to make all the difference. The staff are always cool and when I order delivery it never really takes too long."}
{"text":"We had the wings and pizza delivered last night. Good food and our delivery was about 15 mins earlier than expected. If you like spicy pepperoni then you will like this topping. The wings were very good but next time I will order extra crispy. No complaints on how our wings were cooked, I just prefer a crisper wing."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Whole wheat pies taste yummy. My favorite item on the menu is the Pizookie. Ice cream and a delicious chocolate chip cookie. Carb overload I love you"}
{"text":"I eat here often because their pizza is delicious! It may sound boring to some, but plain cheese pizza is usually my go-to. Theirs is amazing! The crust is a cross between chewy and doughy, and the cheese is super stringy and they top it off with herbs. I'm a real stickler about sauce, but Zzeeks' sauce isn't too bitter, acidic or generic. Each pizza I've had from there tastes like everything is homemade, like it's made from scratch.  If ordering in at the restaurant, be aware that they sometimes have Karaoke nights. (Last time I ordered for pick up, it was kind of loud because of a group of 11 year olds singing their heart out to Katy Perry haha.) But if Karaoke is your thing, then this might be even more of a reason to come here.  You will not regret eating here. They are always having killer deals, sell delicious pizza and wings and have a friendly atmosphere and workers. I suggest you try their mac-n-cheese bites with their ranch sauce. But be careful, they are extremely addicting!"}
{"text":"Don't know how we missed  it all this time, been to enough Chuck E Cheese parties and never noticed Zesty Zzeeks.     Ordered a large cheese and put ham and pineapple on half for me.  Yes, everyone is correct they rock the Hawaiian.  Covered in smokey ham and plenty of chunks of pineapple.  The order taker enthusiastically sold me on the bread sticks (nuggets) and she was correct.  My daughter even ignored the pizza to keep eating them.   I was looking forward to the marinara but it was a bit too spicy for my wimpy digestion.  Definitely looking forward to repeating the experience."}
{"text":"I like this place.  I could even come to love it. The people who work there are nice,  the wing flavors are yummy and the pizza is generally very good.  I've only been a few times now but each has been a slightly different experience.  The first time,  the wings had no crisp but had great flavor.  The second time, the wings had a slight crisp (dryness) to the outside which was amazing for the texture difference! And this last time,  it was sort of soggy and small,  but again, great flavor.  My only real grip so far is that I was given old pizza last night.  It might have been because I went after 10pm for a slice and 5 wings combo but my pizza looked like it had been sitting there all day.  It was super dry and crisp in certain areas.  Made me kind of sad, since the other times,  the pizza slice was on point. Ah well, hoping this was a fluke and y'all will go back to being amazing always!"}
{"text":"Enjoying myself some salad, gluten free wings and gluten free pizza...absolutely delicious! My dog is here with me, sitting out on the patio...owner served my dog water and pepperonis! Love this local pizza place- amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"They are always so awesome! They have the best pizza and wings ever.  Customer service is always bomb even though I call them pretty drunk and usually answer the door when they deliver with no pants on."}
{"text":"My service comments have been removed, Jody the owner contacted me with clearing any issues. I did not know a robbery occurred a day before my arrival."}
{"text":"This was our first visit after reading rave reviews. Without a doubt, ZZ's lived up to expectations! Very friendly and enthusiastic workers. It is the kind of place that leaves you in a better mood- and the pizza was delicious :) we will be back without hesitation. Happy birthday Zzeeke! See you next time,  Maddie & Tim"}
{"text":"Five stars! Love to support this local establishment. Bonus: the pizza is awesome. Do yourself a favor and get some bread sticks. They are so good! I love love love that they do the free delivery. I hope they keep that up because it is the main reason we get it when we are deciding whether to go here or somewhere else. Got a delivery zzeeks on the way right now!"}
{"text":"I think this is an prime example of 4 plus start rated meals by 2 star people.  I had the buffalo chicken and it was pretty light on the chicken part of buffalo chicken.  First two bites was buffalo flavored bread.  The mac and cheese bites were 1 star weak... commercial made crap! You can skip them altogether which is unfortunate. The delivery guy was great,  the order was filled quick and it was nice to use the app to order my meal."}
{"text":"Still so good. Went in to order a pizza to freeze for school lunches but we finished half before we even got out the door!"}
{"text":"This was recommend by a friend. The vegetarian pizza was really good, I just would've enjoyed extra sauce like I requested."}
{"text":"Came back to try again and was not dissapointed. Manager from before remembered me and apologized. I feel a little bad now because he was very friendly so I guess it was just a bad night. Pizza was fresh and not excessive on the cheese which I like."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, awesome cheese curds, fantastic staff and TVs galore! This is pizza lovers heaven and I will definitely be back again to sample more of the menu.   If you are around Tempe and looking for great eats, give them a try. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Probably the best wings in town (60 cents on Sunday ) I get the Honey Citrus Pepper, Caribbean Hot, and Angry Mustard mostly.  Not a huge fan of the Gunslinger sauces, they are a little too thick and pastie for my liking. Great pizza and appetizers and Jody and Zeke are the nicest people.  They also serve beer so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Obviously deliciously alwayssss, but ordered delivery and I noted \"text/call me, do not ring the door bell,\" And then at 11PM, my roommate knocked of my door asking if I was expecting a delivery.... Not OK. Please pay attention to the notes when delivering."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is awesome and the staff here are the friendliest I've ever known in the service industry!  Plus, having to compromise on sharing  GLUTEN FREE pizza has never been better. The prices are great and couldn't even tell the difference in the crust.  We come here a few times a month at least, we love it!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a great experience from the get-go - went to pick-up an order placed thirty minutes earlier, but they weren't able to find it. After being told it would be coming out soon (I believe that's what they said, as the DJ (also, a DJ?) was playing the music too loud for me to hear much of anything that was being said), I waited another twenty minutes. Eventually, I was called up to ask about the order, only to find out it had been ready for some time. Although the staff was friendly, they didn't seem too concerned that I had been waiting. While the food was okay, both my fiance and I found random toppings in our calzones (she had random bits of red onion while I had more than a few olives). Hoping it was just an off night."}
{"text":"I used to eat pizza regularly, but that was YEARS ago. For the past umteen years, if I eat pizza more than once a year, that's a LOT... until I found Zzeeks.  I got hungry for pizza a couple months ago and went looking for something besides the standard pizza chains. I ran across Zzeeks here and saw lots of good reviews so I ordered.  I've ordered 4 MORE times since then!!   Now, I can only tell you about the pizza toppings, because I'm a low carber. Everything has been super full of flavor. The white sauce is to die for but I still order half and half because I do like the red sauce too. But the Philly Steak is incredible, so that's been on ALL my orders... in fact, I've been ordering extra on that one. The meatballs are awesome too!  As for the delivery, the guys are super fast (first place I've ever ordered pizza delivery where they give you an estimated 25 minute delivery time and then follow thru on it (and that's saying a LOT because my address is tough to find). Speaking of, if you have an off way to your house, they don't have a \"special delivery note\" area on their site yet (I've submitted the suggestion), so you may wanna call and have them add a note for the delivery guy.  All of them that have come here have been super friendly too!! I don't find that ANYwhere on a consistent basis in today's world so when I do find them, I'll keep getting food from them!  Also, you can order online for a later delivery. Today's the first day I've ordered that way, so we'll see how that works out. :)  I'm sure I'll eventually try their wings, but so far, I'm just loving the pizza!"}
{"text":"Love the cauliflower crust.  Made my kids try it, in secret, they liked it too and had no clue that's what they were eating until I told them.  All the food is good.  And I'm not sure how often they have karaoke but when they have in the last, it kid friendly and the kids have a blast.  I know mine did!"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot people say how great the pizza is here so I wanted to try it.  I ordered 2 12' pies and Mac and cheese bites. Chicken bbq pie was over cooked.. ok it was brunt. The beast I think you call it was Luke warm and I asked for extra cheese and it didn't look like they put extra cheese.  The Mac and cheese bites were cold but after a little warm up they were good. Delivery guy was super nice and so was the person who took the order. However, for $46. not including tip not worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza arrived HOT Plenty of nicely flavored wings Pizza had a GREAT taste, nicely baked Will be back You may want to offer a Senior Discount however this was much better then the pizza we ordered two weeks ago from someone else"}
{"text":"Fast delivery!  Girl who delivered friendly and polite. Food is amazing.  Guy who took my order patient with all of my questions"}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza places in Ahwatukee.  We order pizza at least once a month from here.  Friday they have live karaoke for the kiddos."}
{"text":"Since my last review I found out that gluten was killing my thyroid. I was excited to see zeeks had gluten free crust, since it was my go to pizza. But I was disappointed the crust was so hard I could break a slice in half. I want to give  it another time eventually. If you don't have a gluten intolerance go with the original crust its so Mich better"}
{"text":"The pizza is alright here, but this is hands down the best place to get a meatball sub!"}
{"text":"I've already been here 5 times and ordered the pepperoni pizza every time! It is addicting and we always have enouph for breakfast. Fast delivery and friendly service every time!"}
{"text":"Pizza, chicken wings, bread sticks arrive in less than 30 minutes? A PLUS!! My family loved it, and my father is really picky about his pizza. I need to come in one day, I always pass by and I always get delivery. Great food!"}
{"text":"Killing time waiting for the car to be done. Why not try someplace new for lunch?  Pretty good wings for a pizza joint. The Hot is pretty much Frank's/Durkee level.  A couple other flavors sounded interesting. Fries are good.  Don't seem frozen. Maybe a little salty for some but just right for me. Friendly staff, lots of regulars filing in & out. I'd come back and try the pizza.  Bonus points for being a Pepsi place!  Dew it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! If you are lucky enough to live near Zzeeks, you must try it! And they deliver!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good, friendly staff and the hotel deal you can't beat. This will be a regular spot for me! If you are in town and looking for some good pizza that delivers I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have had take out, delivery, and I have dined in. All I have to say is besides the food being pretty good this place has the best service of any place that could be called competition. Everyone is friendly and comfortable enough to crack a joke here and there and make everyone feel welcome. Good job hiring the staff and I will continue to make this \"my\" pizza place.  If I could complain about one thing is that the hot sauce for the wings isn't hot at all, was a bit disappointing because I like REALLY hot wings. Maybe in the future add an extra hot option for people like me."}
{"text":"Went for lunch With two other coworkers. We called ahead to make sure they had slices ready to serve and we got there and it took 30 mins to get our food after our order keep in mind our lunch break is only 30 mins so we pretty much had to rush back and eat on the go. The pizza was really awesome but that's the other reason it got two stars. The workers there looked confused and there was no work flow. Take notes from Barro's how they have their pizza ready for their customer. This place will never be successful during a lunch hour."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! The food is delish! Everything is home-made, whether it's their fantastic pizza, their salads, their wings, their sandwiches- everything!!! The food is cooked to order & the portions are large. The prices are very reasonable. The team members are very friendly & really contribute to a super pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"DO NOT order the mac & cheese ... ever ... unless you want some plain and blend craft mac & cheese. The delivery time is great, pizzas are very good, the Pizzookie desert is huge and really good (Ask them to make sure it s not over done if you want to make sure it won t be slightly burnt around the edges). Wings were ok but not the best wings I ever had, 1 st time they were quite dry and second time they were good, not great but good. Sandwiches were really good as well, so far I have tried about all of them and never was disappointed. To me, it's a great fresh pizza and sandwiches delivery joint with a great massive desert on top !"}
{"text":"Best wings we've had in Tempe, and I'm very picky. Not greasy, not fatty, lots of meat, good amount of breading and sauce.  Fried zucchini was also good."}
{"text":"Wow! I ordered a pizza today Canadian bacon and pineapple... All I can say is wow. This was a really good pizza. The crust was cooked perfectly and the toppings were excellent! Well the pineapple seemed canned but that's kind of to be expected but the cheese was divine! Plenty of it too. The good came fast and the delivery guy was courteous. The salad I hit with it had fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce, spinach, red cabbage and olives.. I was expecting the usual old semi decent salad but I'm actually looking forward to reading this salad. I will be ordering from here again. Thanks again is good to know bring laid up in the hospital won't limit awesome pizza's"}
{"text":"We stopped I because traffic was bad in Tempe. Got a philly cheese steak pizza. It was so so yummy. Hot and fresh. The crust was crispy on the out side and soft on the inside. Loved the inside with big tvs, fun chalk boards and great staff. The manager was so nice and told us about other specialties we will have to try next time. Loved it all. Thanks."}
{"text":"Sometimes I read the less-than-five-star reviews and I really wonder about the lives and taste buds of the reviewers. Lemme say. This is our GO TO for delivery. And pizza in awhatukee in general. It's f***ing delicious. And of the zillion times I have ever eaten here/ordered delivery, I have had a problem ONCE. That was thru a third party app (use them so I can tip our delivery person without my kid having to sign my credit card slip). And even then-they delivered a FREE pizza. They strive for customer service. Their employees are amazingly attentive. They have &2.50 bottle beer all day every day. And they have a decent draft selection. Our first visit to the joint years ago was after moving to the neighborhood and the manager (?owner) gave us free dessert to welcome us. I honestly can't praise them enough. They have teenagers working here but they give better service than half the restaurant staff in the Tuk. The angry mustard Wing are To.Die.For. And I have never met a pizza I don't love. If you eat in-try the challenge. The boyfriemd and teenager won T-shirt's and free food for conquering. Seriously those who review this and say they prefer Dominos or Papa Johns or Pizza Hut have questionable judgement. Trust me. I'm a pizza snob. And really just am all around snob. So there"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Took 40 minutes for a slice of pepperoni pizza. When it was finally delivered all I got was A mumbled \"Sorry about that.\" Seemed forced and insincere."}
{"text":"I tried I really did. Many times, thinking maybe next time it will be better. The wings... what are they... semi breaded? Are they even real chicken? They are not good, I asked for them crispy and every time I get them they are soggy but look burnt. The blue cheese is by far the grossest blue cheese dressing I've ever had. Sadly last time I ordered they forgot to put my ranch in the box. I ate 3 wings and tossed them, I couldn't eat the soggy guys with the disgusting blue cheese. The salads! Why why why must you buy the bag mix? Get some fresh lettuce and chop it yourself. The bag shit is grosssssssss and cheap!!!! I wanted to jump on the band wagon and support the local shop but it didn't work out that way. Good luck, let me know when you get better wings."}
{"text":"I am giving this three for the neighborhood feel and karaoke. This place is like a second home to Arcadia families. TVs on the tables for the children, so they don't see you drinking your fifth beer. Kids can count at a much earlier age, you know. I don't have kids so this does not pertain to me, but you know who you are. We saw you. Drinking and singing badly in front of the locals while your kids stayed glued to Sponge Bob. The pizza was extremely average. We thought it a mix between Papa Johns and Pizza Hut. But its something to suck up the alcohol after you sing your lungs out to Fall Out Boy. The wings were heavily breaded and not my thing. Kids probably like those , too. Yelp gets you  a sack of free grease balls, aka zeppole that will test your stomach acids but taste really good, reminded me of the state fair \"we fry everything booth\"."}
{"text":"Despite living a mile away I have never been here. My wife has many many allergies and can not eat most places. She was gone so I thought I try it out. The pizza was good. I got New York style with pepperoni and garlic. I liked it a lot. I would come back for more.  My wings were not as spicy as I hoped and they ended up being soft and mushy by the time I got home. The owner reached out quickly to offer a few suggestions. If you like hot go suicide. If you like crispy have the sauce on the side to add on later. Makes sense. They offered me a redo and either way I think this will fix the issue. UPDATE having the sauce put to the side helps a lot. The suicide sauce will make you cry and clear your head! LOVE IT!  So over all this would be a very good go to place when the game is in or the wife in gone!"}
{"text":"I went to yelp to find a good pizza place for delivery. I have to say this is one of the best tasting pizzas I have had in AZ..... The pizza was fresh , it had great taste and flavor..They used real fresh cut veggies which is so much better than other competitors who use frozen process junk...I didn't care to much for their wings however, they were just ok. Overall my experience was great. Will order again."}
{"text":"We are in town from another area and stopped due to the reviews. I'm a foodie. I'm also a 3 stars is average person.   I say blah to this establishment. We had a medium pizza, half pepperoni and half cheese. The pepperoni is very thin and there wasn't much on the pie. The pizza was extremely greasy.   The crust and crust was nothing to write home about. To me, good pizza is in the crust and sauce.   We had a parmesan chicken sandwich. Dreadfully done. I don't even know where to start.   The soda machine was not calibrated correctly and my soda tasted like... soda water but was brown. The kids loved their strawberry eegee's. So that's a score, but how can it be when that comes from another restaurant?  We also had tater tots, which were good.   That came to $38.00 plus change. Insane.   I have no, no idea how they have these reviews. Over inflated pricing, tasteless food."}
{"text":"I will start off with the good. Their Teriyaki wings were very good. If I was ever forced to eat here again I would just stick to their bone in wings. My wife went with the Honey BBQ boneless and she said it didn't taste like BBQ sauce. The pizza was on par with peter piper pizza. It was tomato sauce on card board. The ingredients where very cheap and probably frozen at one time. The wife said her plain cheese pizza was ok. I did a split on my pizza. I did half Grand slam and half chicken pesto. This way I could run them up against Venezia's my fav Arizona pizza since that is pretty much my order there. Pesto sauce was weak. The spinach over powered their sauce. I held the sun dried tomatoes and did garlic instead. Still didn't get a hint of garlic. The crust was weak the bread had no flavor. Then onto the Grand Slam this was when I was disappointed really hard core. Like I said before it tasted like there ingredients all had the same flavor. And the flavor was from the freezer. Bottom line is if you want cheap pizza domino's or Pizza hut is way better. If you want Great pizza that costs as much as Zesty Zzeeks order Venezia's."}
{"text":"OMG. some of the best pizza and cheezy bread we have had in a long time... pizza was perfect. crust was just right and loaded with toppings.. Cheesy bread was amazing.  Ordering from tlp and delivery was right on time.  If I was local  I would put this at the top of the list for ordering again.  A true gem."}
{"text":"First off let me say I've ordered from here quite a few times and the pizza is great!  I hate that I'm leaving a review when it's bad but tonight's delivery order was very sub-par.  First,  my large chef's salad didn't come with the ranch dressing it was supposed to.  Second, normally I have to use two hands to eat this pizza due to being full of toppings and hot.  Tonight, it was barely warm and stiff, like it had sat out for awhile.  I WILL order from them again unless this happens again.    UPDATE: The service and quality has been restored to 4-5 star ratings.  The management reached out to me which was much appreciated."}
{"text":"Pizza was greasy and it took them 32 mins to deliver it to our table. My kids were completely done with their meals by the time our pizza arrived. The guys seem careless and clueless about customer service because while we were in there, another customer complained. If you want fast and good pizza don't come here!"}
{"text":"Finally a place that has awesome pizza and fast delivery First timer tried the 12\" grand slam and a 16\" pep/mushroom. Can't wait to try the thin crust next and maybe some wings....."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I can't say enough about Zzeeks they have the best Pizza in Tempe, ice cold beer and great customer service. They have tv's all around and they do the Sunday ticket. They have wings pizza subs and everything u can expect from a pizza place I will never go to Dominos or Pizza Hut again this place is amazing u have to try it for urself. When u come ask for Ed he is the store manager and he will never say no."}
{"text":"this place is amazing tvs everywhere all the sports baseball ticket nfl sinday ticket and college football this place is great"}
{"text":"The chicken wings were tasty and the staff seemed nice, that's it tho.  I've eaten better pizza in high school!"}
{"text":"I ordered a slice with ham, pineapple, pepperoni, red onion and jalepeño, and received just ham and pineapple. Friend #1 ordered a slice with ham, pineapple and jalepeño, she received pepperoni and jalepeño. Friend #2 ordered bread stick bites and received dessert bites. 3 wrong orders in a row. I guess it's policy."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up 30 minutes ahead, because I live pretty far away. They told me they would hold off on cooking it so it would be hot when I got there at 7.30. They obviously didnt, when I got to my mom's house (less than 10 minutes from zzeeks) with the pizza,  it was cold.  Also I ordered a deluxe, and they gave me a grand slam. I'm glad I paid $26 bucks for a cold pizza I didn't order."}
{"text":"I tried the wings on Sunday, it's hard to believe these guys have 60 cent wings on Sundays, but to my surprise not only is the true but the  Wings were delicious. I had 10 of the angry mustard and 10 of the Caribbean's hot. I've never seen those wing flavors anywhere else and was blown away with how awesome both Wing sauces were. I would highly recommend this restaurant to you"}
{"text":"My husband and I almost every Friday get delivery from here and not once has it not been perfect. We are OBSESSED with their wings"}
{"text":"I ordered a Beast pizza and Cheese curds from this location.  Delivery was right on time and she brought it up directly to the hotel room i was staying in. That was greatly appreciated. So the cheese curds were fine.  But the pizza,  what a mess.  It was soggy,  greasy,  and for some reason,  a bunch of the toppings had rolled off the pizza and rolled into the corner of the box.   I ordered from this place because yelp said it was quick and close to my hotel my family and i stayed at.  Never going to order from here again."}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic College Pizza joint vibe going on. The pizza is amazing; it's more artesian than plain ole pizza-joint fair. The ingredients are fresh (you can taste the difference), and the pizza sauce is good.  The wings were above average ... fried, but not greasy; and the Caribbean hot flavor that I got, was uniquely good. To top it off, they have a bit of variety on their beers on tap. I had a Kilt lifter, which tasted fresh and crisp - the way it should. (Oh ... and they have some great deals too - like, a slice and a beer for $6 ... among others)  All in all, this is definitely a place that I'll be going back to more often."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Ahwatukee 3 weeks ago, and I have ordered from here twice. Both times it was so delicious. I won't be eating Paper John's, Pizza Hut or Dominos again."}
{"text":"Best pizza & wings! My favorite is the Mango habanero wings they're full of flavor so addictive no joke! The pizza is delicious so fresh. My favorite pizza & wing place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food, clean establishment, and friendly service. I'm a big fan of all the zzeeks locations and if you happen to be in the area I strongly suggest giving them a try! They always do everything within reason to accommodate me, and that always keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Great local ahwatukee family pizzeria! They always go above and beyond and make each and every guest feel like part of the family. I'm very picky and usually a pain in the butt the way I want my food made :) but they always do their best to accommodate me and always with a smile. I have found my forever Pizzeria! Affordable, fresh, and friendly, what more can you want from your dining experience?"}
{"text":"Zesty Zzeeks iz tazty enough to put zome zip in your zapatos! (My version of having pep in your step) We decided to come here over some other pizza places because we wanted a no fuss, utilitarian type pizza that would be ready quickly. Zzeeks fit the bill exactly. They offer full pizzas in different sizes and toppings, wings, desserts, and single slices. They also had a few combo deals that looked tempting for dining in.   We got a 16 inch deluxe pizza to go. After about 15 minutes and a little over $20 later our pizza was hot and ready for the trip back home. When we opened up the pizza box it looked amazing. All the ingredients tasted fresh and meshed well with each other. I especially liked the fresh red onion chunks that provided an extra bit of texture and sweetness to the pizza. While good, for me the crust didn't totally taste like a New York style as advertised. It was more of a \"medium\" crust rather than thin crust. It had a slight crispness to it but it didn't fully capture that wonderful interplay between light crisp crust with more soft pliable texture that you find in a great thin crust NYC pizza. Maybe it's true what they say about the NYC water making the dough so good.  It was an overall satisfying pizza though and I'll be back to try more, especially since I still have a free check in offer to redeem!"}
{"text":"Been passing by these guys since they opened and finally got in to try it out. Had the meatballs (5 in sauce) and boneless wings and fried zucchini. Staff was nice. Food was great. I'll be back for more meatballs. Zucchini was okay."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! I'm usually disappointed when I ask for crispy crust but this place was great, even when we got it home. I ordered hot wings and they were a little soggy but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming it's because they were take out. I do wish they had been spicier, though. Definitely worth it for the pizza but I'll probably keep looking for a great wing spot."}
{"text":"We ordered take out the other night and it was pretty quick. The staff was friendly and helpful. We liked their veggie pizza. It was loaded with yummy veggies, pizza sauce was very good and crust was great. We would definitely eat here again but next time we want to dine in. The place looked clean with decent beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"Went the this place with my family, we had a coupon delivered to our door and decided to try it out. This space has been a few places since Sammy B's and has not had a decent slice since their departure. We ordered nachos, boneless wings and a large pizza all for under $30 with drinks. Without the coupon that alone would not make this worth it.   Our nachos arrived and were nothing special, the cheese was shredded and melted on instead of a more liquid cheese and the jalapeños were good but not as much heat as I would have liked. The wings were very good but reminded me of the Anytyzers you can pick up at the supermarket and make yourself. The pizza was decent but I was pretty much full by the time it came out. It wasn't too greasy but there was nothing about it that wowed me.    The staff is very friendly, it appeared to be family run and I always try to support family businesses over chains. I would come back, just not without a coupon."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Zzeeks Pizza. I am their newest fan. I am very picky about pizza. Their sauce is amazing. Zesty is the right word for it. They followed my special instructions to the tee. I specifically chose today to eat Zzeeks because they are doing a fundraiser to help raise money for a local girl who needs brain surgery. I love that Zzeeks is such a great supporter of our local Ahwatukee community."}
{"text":"I ate a bunch of wings here with my homeboy and I gotta tell ya man, these are some good wings. I went for lemon pepper which were SO. TASTY. Don't remember the other 6 dozen wings we got but I maxed out on my wing intake that day. Needless to say, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered wings and a side of macaroni and cheese. Service was excellent. Wings were quite tasty. However the mac and cheese they served was Kraft -- straight from the box made complete with sauce from that powdered packet! What the heck?! For $3.99 for the side dish I would at least expect homemade cheese sauce and a nice baked little casserole. Shame on you, Zzeeks."}
{"text":"My family loves Zzeeks Pizza!!  The pizza is wonderful and I love that they over the 20\" pizza. The wings are spot on...best wings I have ever had. And the flavors of wings are endless seriously. We love the Caribbean Hot and the Angry Mustard. They recently added fried pickles to the menu and goooood!  The owners are involved in the community too which is refreshing!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from them tonight. The pizza and Phillycheesesteak sandwiches are amazing. Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves pizza. I hope I can order from here again soon. Can't wait to try their wings! Thank to everyone who works hard to make those delicious pizzas"}
{"text":"Prompt delivery. I ordered the chicken bacon ranch sandwich and a salad. Both were great!"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner with my fiance and son, and food was \"Ok\". We got a pitcher of beer with a giant chip in the glass pitcher (hoping the glass isn't IN my beer). Then when we asked for a to go box for our pizza, and 2 other boxes for left over wings and breadstick bites. It was then that the person at the counter told my fiancé \"Well,  we'll just give you a pizza box and see how that goes first\" Wtf???? I'm pretty sure we know what boxes we need for the amount of food we have leftover. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"So I've ordered from here a number of times, always the same thing & it always comes the same way. Tonight was no different, but the product was. Extremely disappointed I called while still in the parking lot. I explained the situation to Dylan. He understood my dissatisfaction and made it right. Everything about Dylan was awesome, thank you!  Couldn't be more satisfied and appreciated as a customer."}
{"text":"Went there to try their lunch special the other day and it was worth it! Not only do they have EEGEES, which would make me go just for that, but the pizza was really good too! Got the $5 lunch special and the slice was HUGE. Good sauce and a funny atmosphere. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I tried and I tried and I tried to order pizza from these guys.  We had agreed on an order and at that moment I had a call come in THAT I HAD TO take.  I asked the lady to hold for 30 seconds and she hung up immediately.  I called back to complete the order the the guy asked me for my credit card number 8 times and still said he did not get it.  He went on about their computer system this and the computer system that.  After I give my credit card number 8 times I give up."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place! I forgot to put my apartment number on my online order and they called very quickly to find out the right place to deliver instead of just waiting until the driver got lost. Their delivery is great and they were here within 20 minutes of ordering online! I will definitely be ordering from them again, everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I must say it was absolutely delicious!!!!  My food arrived on time which is not often when ordering pizza and my delivery driver Dillon was absolutely polite and the prime example of what customer service should be .... I will be ordering here again"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once and usually I give things a second chance but I doubt I will this time.  The pizza tasted like it was from the frozen pizza section in the bashas that is in the same parking lot...and not even one of the decent frozen brands.  The bacon and sausage on top were pathetic looking and tasted the same.  The whole pizza left much to be desired.    I was also not to thrlled about the younger cook using his bare hands to toss the pizza dough in the air.  Hopefully I am not the only one bothered by that.      This was a take out order and after I had paid I asked for ranch.  The manager said the ranch dressing is usually 30cents per container but this time would be free.  I guess I am not a restaurant owner but charging for ranch seems a bit tough.  Especially thinking how much money must be made on that mark up if you do sell a lot of it."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here and it is AWESOME !!!!  Great environment. The server Erik was pleasant and extremely proficient. The pizza slice was huge. The thin slice dough was awesome. Would recommend this place for lunch to anyone. DEFIANTLY WARRANTS 5 STARS!!!!  Would give more stars if I could. Definitely going to plan a return visit and will bring friends"}
{"text":"I order a delivery at 22:04, Feb. 27th. It should be delivered at 22:51. However, I have not seen anything at 23:51. When I tried to call the restaurant there is nobody answering the phone call, and it said closed online! I am wondering where is my order lol. DO NOT EVER ORDER DELIVERY at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We've come back a few times and the pizza has gotten a lot better. They let us know the last time we were in that they have updated the gluten free pizza. The ingredients have been super fresh and this has become our new pizza spot!"}
{"text":"Cauliflower pizza was fantastic. Been hearing good things about it for a while now so finally gave it a try and it did not disappoint. Much healthier but taste like a normal old pizza."}
{"text":"I finally got to try Zeeks. I got the meat pizza it tasted good and looked good only disappointment was that when I picked up a slice most of the toppings fell off. I was very disappointed with the hot wings. They were not spicy at all and just didnt taste that well. One thing I really enjoyed was that they have eegees, not sure if I would choose this as my first choice for pizza."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! It is our new Thursday dinner spot. Great staff great food!"}
{"text":"The wife and I had a restaurants.com coupon so we checked out the Tempe location.  I was a little confused when I walked in because there is no signage saying where to order, or if you seat yourself.  The place has \"wings\" and \"pizza\" in the name so it was perfect for the wife and me, until you get the food.  The wings were super tiny.  They may have been half the size of a normal chicken wing.  The sauce was quite good, but I was left disappointed because I didn't have enough actual \"wing\".  The wife had a calzone, and that was pretty solid... very good!  They had drink specials posted for every day of the week and they seemed really decent.  It is just hard for me to get past the itty-bitty wing committee they have going on here.    We will be back, but I am looking forward to trying the pizza with some cheap, cold beer!"}
{"text":"Overall the pizza were good not excellent but rather good. I wasn't to impress with their house salad, it has bacon, ham, & chicken. Their wings were average nothing to rave about. I'll probably give this place a try again this time I'll order a salad without the 3 meat. Excellent for family dining & the price is right on."}
{"text":"Great pizza, lots of varieties, everyone there is supper nice. This is the quintessential locally owned restaurant that has great food and service."}
{"text":"Just tried the cauliflower pizza and wow! It IS amazing! I'm a super picky pizza snob and I am amazed that isn't not a flour crust. The pepperoni isn't exactly low cal but so least I saved on the carbs! Highly recommend Zzeeks"}
{"text":"We gave it another try and so glad we did. Everything was hot and delicious. We had the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Pizza and it was really good. Perfect amount of cheese, real bacon bits and the crust was perfect. The jalapeño poppers were hot and very good. Customer service...EXCELLENT! Madeleine took my order over the phone and she was so friendly and helpful. When I picked up the order, I was greeted warmly and right away. I didn't get the names of the (2) young men that checked me out but they were both friendly and polite. Jody, thank you for the gift certificate, not necessary but it shows how much you care your business. We will be back. Thank you"}
{"text":"Thank you to Mr. Zzeeks for showing the best customer appreciation and taking care of us! Can't wait for my pizza and Eegee's!!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't spend the time doing reviews, but this place was so bad I thought I'd help others out. Pizza was on par with boxed pizza from Wal-Mart. We finally got our wings 10 minutes AFTER 5 of us finished eating. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"I eat pizza often and I have to say this is by far my favorite! The sauce they use is sooooo good and the pizza tastes great. The wings were made to perfection (well done). The fries are thin but still very good. Lastly, the zepoles (fried dough balls dipped in powdered sugar i believe) ... TASTY!! I'll be back to eat here. Definitely worth it and price wise it is compatible with most pizza shops."}
{"text":"Just got a delivery and the sandwich was wrong. So I called them up and told expecting to get some push back or maybe a credit for next time but by the time I even finished telling the manager what was wrong she had the order resent out. Her customer service was amazing. The rest of the order was correct and tastes great. This was my first time ordering and even though it was wrong I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Our first time here and there was a misunderstanding about the pricing on the menu. The manager made it right in the end. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Went to lunch and this place was pretty good. Ordered mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini and wasn't too impressed. Friend zucchini was a little too soft and squishy, and the mozzarella sticks were a small step up. Both tasted like they came from a bag, but they were fairly good. Next we got the veggie pizza which was the highlight of the meal. The vegetables weren't cooked very much, but it was still good. They use some really good, stringy mozzarella cheese. Could've used more sauce, but it was good. Overall a pretty good dining experience, just some minor issues with the food."}
{"text":"Great wings(even though they're pretty small) better pizza, and don't even get me started on the eegees! Love coming here to eat always great service! Can't believe I've wasted all these years going to Venezias lol but my new go to pizza and wing spot!"}
{"text":"This place started out with great food and great attitudes. The toppings were chopped up nicely on the pies and the pizza was cooked to perfection. As they gained success the pies started arriving overcooked with bubbles in them and toppings haphazardly thrown on top in unappetizing chunks. The sauce and cheese was far more sparse as well. When I call to place an order lately suddenly I'm getting an attitude projected at me like I'm ripping them off for utilizing a coupon that they themselves had sent me in the mail. Additionally the cost of these pies is several dollars higher than their competitors, as if they were still offering a superior pizza like when they first opened, with the pies no longer being any better than the competitors. In fact, they are overcooked and unappealing and inferior at this point.  It's sad to see as they became successful they forgot what made them successful. I also found a note written in ink on my pizza box in big letters GET THE COUPON...again, acting like I was a thief for using a coupon mailer they had sent me. I never had a pizza place do this to me before. ZZeeks WAS good, they are no longer,now, they just want to grab the money. Plenty of places closer to me with better pies, better attitudes, less cost, no no obnoxious notes written on the boxes. Their pizza has been far from \"amazing\" or even decent  for a long time."}
{"text":"Update:  3/19/17  As an update to the review below, I wanted to commend the owners of this establishment.  I received a PM today with an offer to remedy my experience and remake my order (was not expecting this).  The wings were much better this time around and the pizza they recommended was also very tasty.  It was a great gesture and I'm glad I gave them a second chance.    3/18/17 Needed a quick dinner for two so we ordered a pizza and some wings for delivery.  Delivery was timely.  The large white sauce pizza with chicken, onions, and, green peppers was bland.  Crust was decent with good chew.  Wings were not crispy.  Total amount was just over 35 dollars.  Probably won't be ordering from them anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. I ordered for pick up. I was advised by their employee to order the 20 inch  pizza since I had 5 people to feed but 2 of them are young kids. So I ordered 1/2 cheese and 1/2 Deluxe Pizza. Needless to say, when I went to pick it up, it was gigantic and more food than I had wanted since I also got their Fried Mac N Cheese Bites and Small portion of their Wings. The kids each had a slice of pizza so we had plenty of leftovers. The Mac N Cheese bites had mixed reviews. My kids do love Mac N Cheese (whenever they get it) so I thought they'd fall in love with the bites but I was wrong. My youngest thoroughly enjoyed the wings since it wasn't spicy at all and I ordered the Medium spice. Loved all the fresh veggies that came with the meat on the Deluxe. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Zzeek's Pizza Factory -  I discovered them shortly after they opened.  Frankly, they are one of the best pizza locations I've been to in the Ahwatukee area.  These guys are conscientious of their customers and serve a great product.  Their bread-sticks and Zzepoli's are bar none.  The pizza is quite wonderful.  But the thing that really sets them apart is their customer service.  I have food allergies.  They go out of their way every time I show up to make sure I have a good experience.  Last time I went with my friends - the wrong order of bread-sticks was delivered to my table and the cook dashed out of the kitchen to make sure I didn't eat any of that order.  He then replaced it with no further charge.  The same visit we over heard an incident with a lady who was vegan and the pizza she ordered might have had Parmesan cheese added to it, the worker at the counter went out of their way to make sure the pizza was adequate to the customer's dietary needs informing of the possible error and replacing the pizza.  My friends and I often have a joke about Pizza in Phoenix: \"Flavor is a double topping\" due to places like Nello's or Jimmy's where usually we have to order garlic and basil as toppings to get any decent flavor out of the pizza.  This is not the case at Zzeek's.  The crust is good, the sauce is robust and flavorful and the cheese is very good.  I have quickly become a regular here and will continue to be."}
{"text":"I absolutely love them! Their pizza sauce has this amazing spice to it that definitely makes the pizza special! From their lunch specials to their full size pizzas you can't go wrong! I love stopping in for lunch the service is always timely and amazing! They're one of the two only places that serves Egees in this area I use to drive to Tucson for."}
{"text":"Very good had the calzone customer service top notch all and all great neighborhood pizza joint I will come back"}
{"text":"Zesty Zzeeks is a no-nonsense, down right pizza-making machine.   I had the Beast, perfect combination of ingredients and I loved the texture of the dough.  At 20$, the size of the pizza (16\") was enough for 2 for several meals. This is definitely my go to pizza spot, and if you have to wait, just pop into ZIAs next door. Win-win in my book."}
{"text":"I came back to this place and tried there new wings. All I have to say is wow! We really enjoyed the medium and honey barbecue wings. They were fantastic! This is a great wing place if you're into that kind of food. Check them out sometime"}
{"text":"I live nearby and decided to order for delivery. I used the Yelp app to order and it was easy. The delivery was faster than quoted and the food was piping hot. We ordered Jalapeno poppers...fantastic! and a meat combo type pizza that was extremely good. I've lived in the same house for 18 years and haven't found a \"Go to\" pizza delivery joint. Now I finally have one. Thank-you Zesty Zzeeks!"}
{"text":"Had the BEST wings! They have great deals like two slices of pizza and a beer for $6. Forget the subway next door. Oh and the ranch is delicious! Happy hour is great too. Have to try it again."}
{"text":"Having to do business outside my neighborhood allows me to explore new locally owned restaurants.  This was a treat.  I took advantage of a wing special and they were really good!  There are many different Sauces you can choose from which gives you options.  I tried Honey citrus and Caribbean hot and liked them very much.  I will return to try their pies!"}
{"text":"First time at Zesty Zzeeks because we wanted Eeggees - it's the closes to Italian icee.  We walked in and we were immediately acknowledged- We lived that.  Then when we were ready to order it was the owner who took our order (at the time we did not know).  Anyway, he was friendly, funny and accommodating.  We sat down and we were enjoying our Eeggees while our food was being prepared.  Then Zesty the owner delivered our wings and we started to talk about pizza.  He said that they made cauliflower pizza although I wanted to order it we told him we will order that next time because we had ordered too much food.  We were enjoying the atmosphere and our food.  When Zesty came to our table with a 10\" cauliflower pizza.  When I told him how much he was this is on the house.  We were truly amazed by his kindness and generosity and let me tell you the cauliflower pizza was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!   My family and I have found our pizza spot to go to because Zesty was wonderful and we enjoyed our food.  P.S.  they have trivia every Tuesday at 7 pm.  Thank you so much Zesty for your outstanding hospitality and food!  We will see you very soon......."}
{"text":"Order taker, also a pizza maker was very friendly. I ordered the Mac and cheese bites and a 20 inch pizza. Mac and cheese bites were amazing! Warm, cheesy and well cooked. On the pizza, I got half pineapple and half mushrooms and sausage. Pizza was good, not great.   Will I come back? Yes! Very affordable and Mac and cheese bites are great!"}
{"text":"These guys make the best pizza! They have SO many options for crust, toppings, and sauces, which is amazing and something I look for. I get it delivered and it is always timely and looks like it was made with care and consideration, not just thrown together and tossed in the delivery bag. If you are looking for pizza variety that is well made, then go Zzeeks!"}
{"text":"Awesome breadsticks!!! The pizza was decent, tangy sauce which is a bit odd and different but delicious. Owners are extremely friendly"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a pie when you want to get away from DTT.  Not too much of a surprise being that almost everywhere worth eating in Tempe is away from DT, nonetheless it's still a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Man.....wanted to give a 5 star review,  so close. Delicious though. First time here and the wings were the bomb! Great sauce, nice and crispy. The pizza was solid but not the best. Staff was friendly and has a nice beer selection and prices were great. Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"So the key to these wings is to order them extra crispy. I also ate them in the restaurant this time."}
{"text":"The Pie is bomb!! When my family and I are in town from Tucson, Zzeeks is definitely on the list to stop and get some grub. The best Pizza you'll have, hands down. The boys that work there are awesome too, overall a great experience when we go. Keep up the good work and hopefully we'll see you guys open a spot down south in T- Town."}
{"text":"Cheesy bread! YUMMMM!!!!!!!! We ordered it delivery, and pizza and cheesy bread were awesome! We had it delivered to Huss brewing where we were having some beers! They even threw in a complimentary pizza for our bartender!! LOVED IT!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza, great wings... its been a long time coming to finally find a GOOD pizza place in the Ahwatukee area. There are some posers in the area, but this place is the real deal, not only with the great product, but with excellent wait staff, they just made something great that much better. But, what clenched my feelings about the meal was the costs associated with it... Wonderful, just plain wonderful... I just hope that they continue putting out a great product at a reasonable cost and all of it with a smile."}
{"text":"I've had Zzeeks many times, both dine-in and take out.  The food is always good. I love the pizza and so does my entire family. The ingredients are fresh (I saw them chopping toppings last time I was in). The wings are so tasty. I prefer the boneless, but the rest of my family loves the bone-in. The bread sticks are super good too. Check out the entire menu because they also have salads and sandwiches.   If you like draft beers, this is your place! They have a good selection of craft brews-including some local. Right now they have the famous Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter. They also wine.   Support your local pizza joint and give them a try-you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, though overpriced.  First of all, in my humble opinion the best pizza for the dollar is at Costco, and the best $20 pizza is at Nello's.  That said, I was interested in trying Zzeek's as they advertised that they were not a franchise, so I figure I'd try it and give the little guy a chance.  I ordered a 16-inch Deluxe ($19.99) for pickup, and it was ready in 15 - 20 minutes, about normal for pizza these days.  The toppings were fresh, the sauce tasty, the bread good and yeasty.  All in all it was a good pie, not the best but tolerable.  It was better than the $10 Costco combo, but not close to the Nello's combo.  It was a decent pizza for $14, but certainly not $20."}
{"text":"Pros include the online experience and delivery service. Cons include sub-par pizza and customer service at the Warner Road location. I've tried Zesty, three times, and the experience has been too inconsistent to recommend."}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic, and they have Eegees! I believe Eegee's is what God made on Day 8, and these fine gentlemen are charms for saving me a trip to Casa Grande to get my fix. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean, which makes us frequent visitors on our lunch break. Ohh, and I should mention, the pizza slices are huge! One piece is really like 2-3 of other people's slices. Anyway, if you want a good bite and a life changing drink/snack, stop in here and give their lunch special a try."}
{"text":"Delicious  pizza & wings! But the service, from what seemed to be the owner, was the best! Great quick & friendly service is hard to find.  He made us some dessert that was out of this world. We'd definitely become regulars if we lived in town."}
{"text":"Zzeeks has quickly become my favorite pizza in Ahwatukee. Always hot and fresh, you can tell it has more of a homemade feel to it. Plus the garlic knots are AMAZING. They are extremely addicting so beware."}
{"text":"ZEeks sucks. Bottom line. I called and it was 30 min to close and the kid told me to hang on and hung up.. so I called back and the same thing happened 2 more times.. because some lazy kid at the register doesent wana make any pizza while he's at his job TO MAKE PIZZA, I give this place one star from my holy grail of stars to give. Frick off zeeks! Id rather eat dominos."}
{"text":"This place is small but very good pizza!! Beer and Eegees!! I  love this place  will be back Chef Deanna Vitale"}
{"text":"New to town... Called for delivery and the guy in the phone was very pleasant and informative. Tried the pesto chicken pizza on a cauliflower crust and I have to say that I really enjoyed it! I can have a \"pizza\" without feeling too guilty. Flavors were tasty and the crust did NOT taste like cardboard thankfully. My bf got the meat lovers, was a bit too greasy but it has greasy meat on it so that is to be some what expected I suppose (so had to knock it down a star thanks to him). Delivered rather quickly, food was fresh out of the oven, and the delivery lady was very friendly. I will definitely order again! And my bf can just give his order some thought before griping about it haha. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food isn't bad, it really is pretty good pizza. But the ambience and the service was terrible. When I walked up to the counter the two workers behind the counter didn't acknowledge me. One literally ignored me as she was writing down something. The other one finally acknowledged me even though he had already seen me.   The kid was friendly and we got our food. Then we wanted some water cups. 4 or 5 workers looked at me from behind the counter before someone farther back than the rest came up and asked if I needed some help.   During the entire time we were eating the staff were loud in their discussions, so much so that it was a distraction. If it was upbeat and about their work I could understand but it wasn't.   We won't be back. I'll take one of the other places nearby. Barros, Nellos, etc.   ***** Update- Owner Jody P. Responded to my review to try to make it right. Kudos for that effort. That says a lot to me. Maybe we just went in on an off night."}
{"text":"We were recently staying at the Legacy Golf Resort for Spring Training games and after a long day of baseball my sons were too worn out to sit in a restaurant for dinner se we decided to order in. It was pretty late and most places nearby were closed. We found Zzeeks and decided to give them a call. We called the location on Warner and were told we were not in their delivery area and were instructed to call the Mills location. We called them and were told that we were in the delivery area of the 1st location but would be more than happy to help us instead of making us call the Warner location again. We placed our order and were told it would be an hour or so... the or so was 35 minutes. The food was great... Thank you so much for your efforts and BIG A+++ to you and your staff."}
{"text":"LIES! lured by fair priced beer and appealing looking pizza, my family and I were greeted with the horrid reality of this place. Save your money and buy a Digornio! It might be a bit better.  While the beer was served cold, the pizza tasted like a microwaved lunchable. Toppings were over cooked, the cheese was rubbery and flavorless.   It says a lot about a place when a ten year old is in the back prepping food.   Sorry Zzeeks why don't you try again."}
{"text":"Love the pizza!  Made with fresh dough and fresh ingredients the way all pizza should be made.  My son (14) asks if we can go here anytime we're outside the west valley. Outside the west valley must mean we're close, right?  Why?  Because he and his buddies think the Zzepoles are the greatest food EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Love this business. Great pizza and great service. We love that they have gluten free options and the best cheese curds ever!  Jodi and crew are ALWAYS willing to do fundraisers for families and people in need.   We are so thankful to have this business in our community where we can gather together and not only enjoy each other but help each other!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Philly sub was good, spaghetti was too spicy for my toddler to eat, missing fries, tater tots tasted of nothing but oil. Feels like a waste of 30 bucks"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre, fast delivery and friendly service. I would probably order from here again."}
{"text":"We enjoyed lunch at Zeeks. Pizza has a very nice light crust and generous toppings. Hot wings are tasty, meaty and not really hot. I asked for a side of suicide sauce. The suicide sauce is super salty, l dont recommend.  Waiter/cashier needs to work on his food handling. He grabbed pizza toppings with his bare hands ( no gloves), wiped his dirty hands on his pants and continued on to handling food, then cash, then food again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Zesty sauce, super fresh ingredients. The original crust is just right.    Fast and courteous delivery. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"The manager took the time to address my concern which most people don't do to take pride in your company and value each customer is great service I was sent a incentive which I am grateful for  it takes alot to own a business and being able to properly manage your staff making sure that they also provide the best service possible."}
{"text":"Rarely do you find a \"local\" pizza place that has it all...great tasting pizza, fast & friendly service and fair prices. Zzeek's pizza certainly delivers all that and more. My family and I will not be buying pizza from those commercial pizza places anymore. Make sure you give Zzeek's a try. (Don't forget to try Jodi's breadstick bites!)"}
{"text":"We ordered the cauliflower pizza today for the first time and it was amazingly good! My 11 year old nephew is on a very strict diet right now and this was a perfect substitute. He really loved it and was super happy to be able to eat pizza again! Thank you Zzeek!!"}
{"text":"Update- Zzeeks read my review and made it right! Good ppl and awesome Management. Thank you very much...I LOVE their pizza and choose this place for #1 pizza place!  #ZzeeksPizzaLove!"}
{"text":"I took a group of students to Zesty ZZeeks and couldn't have had a better experience! The owners of this pizza place are so friendly and authentic. They really care about their community. The pizza was delicious and reasonably priced. I would 100% recommend and return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved here and have been meaning to try Zeeks Pizza. After a couple months we FINALLY had it and it was definitely a mistake not to eat here sooner! The pizza was definitely one of the best I've ever had, we got the mini bread sticks they have as well and definitely won't skip out on those next time either! Yum yum yum!! Just wish they had one back where we are from :((( and the prices are great as well!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza!!! Love the cinnamon bread dipping dessert also. Fast good service! delivery is always within 30 mins every time I've ordered. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"3/2017 Review Update. Having enjoyed Zzeeks for a few years now, I thought I should update my review. Zzeeks has a great variety on their menu. I recently tried the meatballs and I swear they are fantastic. I have to note that I do believe they have the very best service in all of Ahwatukee. Totally kid friendly. The delivery service is way above par. I ordered a salad for 12 people on Christmas day and the owner actually delivered it on Christmas. They also have yummy deserts!  This is a wonderful family friendly restaurant. The pizza is fantastic and the customer service is great. They make you feel like family."}
{"text":"New to area, yelped a pizza place and tried it out. Pizza was cheesy and fresh, reasonable in price. Good specials. I had mine delivered and the top crust was a little burnt but edible. I'd order again."}
{"text":"What a great find!! I'm not from the area but I've been looking for a place like this for a while. I think there should be a Zzeeks on every corner.  Super friendly, cheap, and GOOD! Awesome atmosphere fully loaded with 5 big screens for the games! Perfect size establishment and an experience you don't want to leave. Got the $5 lunch special complete with a large slice (1/4 of a 17\" pizza) and a fountain drink. Ate there but was given a Togo cup when I was ready to leave. Make sure to ask for a side of ranch to dip, it's on the house! Will come back, even if I have to drive from Mesa to do so. Thanks for an awesome Sunday lunch Zzeeks!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is always hot and fresh, and they offer free delivery to those that live nearby. Sundays are .50 cent wing specials all day - you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Update: the carribean hot wings are hotter than the \"hot\" wings. I think they are maybe cooked in a dry rub or something though? because they were not dipped in sauce like normal buffalo wings.  overall I enjoyed them!"}
{"text":"They have some of the best pizza in tempe, not the best ive ever eaten, but the best ive had locally."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Amazing service awesome environment and great owner. She does a lot of fundraising for local causes!"}
{"text":"Our entire family loves Zzeek's pizza.  Our boys always ask to come here.  The bread stick bites are wonderful and the staff and owners are so friendly and welcoming.  Zzeeks has accommodated both of my son's sports teams on multiple occasions and have been great on working with us for big orders.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. I ordered the cauliflower crust cheese pizza. I was not disappointed! It was sooo good. The crust was perfectly golden brown and crunchy. The sauce was seasoned well and zasty withoit being spicy. The cheese complimented the other ingredients so well. I am definatly recomending this restaurant to everyone i know."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place after living here for a few years...eh, guess I'm happy I went. Ordered the Veggie pizza and Honey hot BBQ wings and was underwhelmed. The pie was soggy in the middle and sauce was bland. The wings were actually good and flavour was nice. The first girl that helped me was really rude and seemed irritated that I was there. However, the second girl that brought my order was really friendly and accommodating.  Items were a little overpriced for what you get and you'd probably get more, bang-for-your-buck going to Papa Murphy's and wings at Safeway for your evening dinner.  If you love gambling and wanna try a crap shoot, get a pie here."}
{"text":"Everything was cooked perfectly everything tasted great first time order nailed it forgot my menu LOL it was all from a package the wife didn't like the ranch she likes Venezia's we cheated on our regular and we'll do it again"}
{"text":"Their wings and pizza actually made me cry. By far the best I've ever had. Unfortunately I only am in AZ for work. I hope they'll expand into California!!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I went in with a Groupon for a $30 order and the guy refuses to let me use it because the guy that I drove with used a Groupon too...I will never go here again because the guy was so smug when he was dealing with me.  To be honest I could have lied and said I didn't come with the guy...great news there are pizza restaurants on every corner at this intersection!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place! I go with my boyfriend probably at least once a month. Always a cheese pizza with extra sauce and drink. Tried the wings once, not bad. But the cheese pizza always hits the spot. Always consistent, fast, friendly.   My complaint? The televisions are too loud... We try and sit as far away as possible.   LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!  EDIT: I'm sad to have to break up with this place. It was true love. But, I look for consistency and although to tried and tried and tried, and tried again. It's never the same and never any better than the last. Maybe someday I'll try again. Until then"}
{"text":"Zzeeks has the most amazing food and best customer service around. They take pride in the food they cook and very family friendly. Good variety of beer on tap and bottles, not just pizza, many other spectacular items. Meatballs are out of this world and the sauce is just the perfect combination of tomatoes and spices. Large screen TV and always willing to accommodate what you want to watch. My son was able to make our pizza and watch the dough bring made. Never stale crust, fantastic in the microwave the next day and always fresh!!!! Support Ahwatukee 's small businesses, they are totally worth it!!! THANK YOU ZZEEKS!!!"}
{"text":"Ed's spicy buffalo chicken pizza is nothing short of amazing! This place is definitely the best pizza place I've ever experienced. Ambiance is mellow with the game on and service is great as well. Definitely coming back, this place is better than Venezia's!"}
{"text":"Ordered the delivery a few days ago. I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Ordered a half Philly cheesesteak half buffalo chicken pizza and Mac n cheese bites. The bites were heavenly! The Philly cheesesteak pizza was okay,  the meat was a little bland tasting, but the second half was good! Delivery was average time, and the gentleman was nice. Will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of pastas, so when I saw this restaurant had pasta on their menu, I had to try it. Their spaghetti with meatballs was okay. I wouldn't say it was the absolute best. My fiancé had the meatball sub which he said was pretty good. I'd say everything was mediocre, but a good time overall. Nice staff!"}
{"text":"I love zeeks pizza there sauce is out of this world !!! Their calzones are mind blowing and there salads don't disappoint   if I could have a delicious ice cold e.g. every night I would . I am honestly addicted to this place  the staff is amazing and are always so friendly  whenever I get my pizza delivered they are always quick and my food is always hot if your looking for quality food and great service I would more then recommend this place"}
