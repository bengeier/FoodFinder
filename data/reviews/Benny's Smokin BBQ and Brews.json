{"text":"Stopped here for dinner not sure what we were walking into. The smell draws you in and the food makes you stay. It was fast, tasty, and reasonably priced. We had been walking through Fremont Street and needed a meal. This definitely hit the spot for his BBQ craving. The only thing that was lacking was the service. Our server was there when we ordered and then to hang us the check. Was disappointed in there follow thru with the service. If you are looking for good decent prices BBQ than this is the place."}
{"text":"Great ribs and the chicken is good too. BBQ sauce was really good. The best place in Vegas is downtown. This is a great little gem of an eating hole. The sports book is real close too. Get ya some!"}
{"text":"This is usually my first dinner when I get into town. The ribs are so tender and very lean. I find I get more meat off their half-rack than most other places' full-racks. 

My travel companion always gets the ribs & chicken combo and raves about both throughout the meal. 

Every table has a roll of paper towels as a centerpiece. You'll need them."}
{"text":"Great service. Great BBQ. The menu is limited, but who really needs more than ribs? Plus, it helps out those indecisive people who are overwhelmed with so many options ;). Loved it!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Binions Christmas eve hoping to eat in the steakhouse but it was closed until New Years for renovations. So I stumbled upon Benny's and I'm glad I did. It wasn't too busy and the menu is super simple, only one page with some standard bbq specials. I chose the half rack of ribs, only $9.99 with casino card. At that price I wasn't expecting much but the plate came out quickly and looked great. It included a nice coleslaw, beans, corn muffin, and a piece of corn on cob. These were some of the best ribs I've ever had. The sides were also excellent. I ate at Tony Roma's the night before and it was also good but three times the price. Very nice atmosphere and good service. Recommended."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious....... Fall off the bone smoked to perfection ribs, and amazing brisket. Fast and friendly service....... Good eats..............

While you are at Binion's.....Don't forget to take your picture with the million dollars and once you are done eating the picture will be ready for pickup......."}
{"text":"The half chicken was dry. The brisket was delicious.  I enjoyed the sides more than the main dish. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Chicken and ribs were really dry. The only thing that was good was the corn on the side."}
{"text":"I was looking for bbq and this place did not disappoint.  The ribs fall off the bone and can honestly say they were the best I have ever had.  

Only bad thing is they need more help the service was a little slow but I'm not deducting any stars cause the two girls were working their asses off.  I had to tip the food runner cause he was quick and hard working.  Other then slow service I really like this place and can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Fast BBQ on Fremont, lots of flavor, ridiculous value. Benny's is a great along the downtown gambling extravaganza.

The ribs are very good for the price. A full rack for under $15. The meat is fall off the bone. 

BBQ chicken is better a little earlier in the day as this hidden gem has pretty long hours. It tends to dry out a bit later on although it is still pretty tasty.

Cornbread is good. Beans are good.

Excellent eating for when you are a little drunk on Vegas partying."}
{"text":"For the price this is great. Located downtown inside binions I couldn't avoid the smell while playing cards. Smoked ribs fell off the bone and priced good for dinner."}
{"text":"As I type this, I'm in Maryland telling friends about Benny's!  It's that good!  I've on more than one occasion planned my Vegas flights so that I could grab some ribs here before departing Vegas.  It's that good!  Now my stomach is growling because it wants some of Benny's Smoking BBQ.  Did I mention that it's good?  Look at the picture of the ribs that i posted on yelp.  You'll see what I mean, not that a picture could properly capture the wonderful taste.

The servers and bussers and wait staff have always been cheery, friendly, courteous and fast."}
{"text":"I don't like giving a 1 star rating. I usually reserve that for a really horrible experience but in this case, this place earned a one star rating. I know that is harsh but this place straight up sucked. 

There were 8 of us and when you have a large group it's difficult to coordinate where to go to eat. Someone in the group suggested we check out the Binion and off we went. We stumbled across Benny's and decided to go in since it wasn't busy. 

There is no hostess stand so you walk in and find your own table to sit at, at least I think that's how it works. The middle aged waitress didn't acknowledge us while we were standing at the front. We walked around the small space seeing if there was a table for 8, there was not. There's only tables for 4. One couple was leaving and told us we could have their table to put together with the open table next to theirs. We did that. The waitress came over and did a quick wipe down with a dirty rag that left streaks and food behind. Eeww. I ended up wiping it down with the paper towels that were on the table.

The menu consists of 4 things. Full rack or half rack of ribs, 1/2 roasted chicken or 1/2 roasted chicken with 1/2 rack of ribs. Prices were really cheap. I'm thinking with only 4 things on the menu, the food has to be phenomenal. I was wrong. Mediocre. The ribs were a dry rub with sauce on the side. The sauce tasted like bottled sauce. My corn was the smallest out of the group about 2 inches long. The slaw was watery and the baked beans tasted like a pound of sugar was dumped in it. I didn't try the corn bread. My friend's chicken wasn't cooked all the way and was pink by the bone so she didn't eat it.

Service was slllloooooooowwwwww. My 86 grandma walks faster than she does. It took about 15 mins (and I'm being generous) for our waitress to come over and give us menus and even longer for her to come back and take our order. She left her bifocals on our table and when we were finally able to flag her down she mentioned she was looking all over for it because she couldn't put in our order since she couldn't see the computer screen. Great. We probably waited about an hour for our food. I really wanted to walk out but my friends said to give it a couple of more mins. Luckily we got our food after that. 

One thing I saw that really disturbed me was, I saw our waitress dumping water glasses full of ice into the water pitcher. I know what I saw. She had 3 of the red water glasses, the same one I was drinking out of and saw her dump all 3 one at a time into the water pitcher. I don't know if she was recycling customers drinking water or if she used the glasses as a vessel to carry ice. She then dropped ice on the counter and scooped it up off the counter with her bare hands and dumped it into the pitcher. I stopped drinking the water and told my friends not to drink it.

There was another waitress there, a younger one but she was more preoccupied with coming in and out of the restaurant. Can't tell you what she was doing but she wasn't working that's for sure. 

When our very frazzled and slow waitress finally brought our check, she actually gave us the wrong check. We had to flag her down and get the correct one. We spent another 15 mins waiting for her to come back with my friend's credit card. Actually she didn't come back so we went to her. My other friends went to go gamble while we dealt with her and my friend's now missing credit card. When she finally found it she hadn't processed it yet. While she was doing that she told us that the party before us forgot their credit card...uh..more like you forgot to give it back. 

Also there was a young couple smoking their vapor there which I thought was rude and disrespectful. I overheard our waitress tell the young man \"oh you go boy, just like smoking a hookah\"...wow...just wow. We were there for more than 2 hours. Walk past this place and don't do it. Seriously not worth it."}
{"text":"This las Vegas local will never return to Benny's BBQ. We didn't even get seated. They do not allow children.  I'm not a fan of kids in casinos or kids at adult events but this is a restaurant. And we were not able to be served. Thanks binions I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Awesome 'Que and tasty microbrews. One of the best kept secrets on Fremont Street. So let's not tell anyone, okay?

Okay, let's tell just enough people to keep them in business... but no more than that."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for dinner and never disappointed. Don't forget to have your parking ticket validated after dining."}
{"text":"Not real BBQ, boiled or steamed meat then grilled. No smoke flavor. If you are looking for authentic BBQ look elsewhere. Chicken was under done and fatty, not something you would find with real BBQ.."}
{"text":"Great smoked ribs, didn't even want to add bbq sauce. Beans were great as well. Simple menu. You can smell the smoker outback as you walk in, it's hard not to order!!"}
{"text":"Didn't get to eat here because they would never seat us. Glad we didn't eat here. Ended up going to eat at Carson Kitchen around the corner and was the best!"}
{"text":"Decided to finally give this place a try instead of the Binion's Cafe (Binion's famous burger at the cafe see my other review a must try). Rolled in sat down at the bar played a little video poker, grab a beer and ordered up the beef brisket platter for $8.99. Beef brisket was really tender, juicy and had some smoke flavor I was impressed. Baked beans were on point and the cole slaw but the corn on the cob and cornbread left a bit to be desired but hey you can't win them all the main job was to get the brisket right and they did who cares about the corn on the cob and corn bread lol! Binion's treats there customers really nice in return for gambling so I comped the meal, beer and tipped the bar tender on top for his service which he was very attentive. I would def return again try the ribs next time. Another great little spot to eat Downtown and Binion's is a top choice for a quality meal at a great price."}
{"text":"I get the feeling not a lot of people know about Benny's unless they either do a search on Yelp or happen to go all the way to the back of Binion's casino. They should. It's nothing fancy, and your choices are limited to about 6 options. But what they do, they do well and serve fast. The beer list is not too extensive but quite varied and has something for everyone. There's plenty of TVs on the wall in front of which you can place yourself for whatever is the important sports match of the moment.  My rack of baby back ribs was quite large and fairly tender, and the one sauce they provide does enhance the flavor. People were equally satisfied with the chicken and brisket. It's a good thing there are rest rooms nearby, because you'll need to wash your hands frequently from all the saucy goodness, particularly from the ribs. If you're an easily satisfied BBQ lover, consider this place. 

One thing to be aware, Wi-fi coverage is quite poor because you are way in the back of the casino."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, just not a great variety.  Food is pretty good.  Service very typical of vegas union type servers.  Prices are fair."}
{"text":"The ribs were dry and tough. Tasted ok but not awesome. Then again the cost was inexpensive. You get what you pay for. If it was pricier I would have been more upset."}
{"text":"An absolute hidden gem of a place, not at all overpriced and food was incredible. Service really good!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with family and our order was the following:
We asked what soft drinks they had and the waitress looked confused and didnt know what they offered and my husband said some and she said yeah, Wrote our order on paper and then came back within 2 minutes to ask us again what we ordered. 
Full rack of ribs meal for my husband and he said they were real good
1/2 chicken meal for myself and I thought the chicken was under cooked, baked beans not great, corn on the cob was corn, corn bread was dry and didn't bother with the coleslaw. 
We asked for a extra plate for our aunt and were told that it was a charge of five dollars and we were dumb founded. 
The service was not great nor good. 
Better places to eat in Las Vegas and WE WILL NOT BE COMING BACK TO THIS PLACE. 
Two stars because husband said the ribs were good."}
{"text":"Service was bad. Food was decent. Waited 15 minutes for a menu while they were only 1/4 full. The waitress walked past me over and over, as I was sitting at the table next to the register. She never acknowledged me and proceeded to have an inappropriate personal conversation with a patron at the bar next to my table for several minutes. I had to grab her and ask her for a menu to get any service. There were also 2 bartenders that I was trying to gesture to to get some service, who also seemed oblivious, standing and chatting right in front of me."}
{"text":"I don't know what we were expecting here but service was bad and the food was par with the service.  I would not go back here again.  I think one of the beers was off."}
{"text":"Pretty good food the chicken kind of dry but ribs fell off the bone.
Service was ok atmosphere was dead considering how late it was maybe. 
Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Spider-sense was tingling. It brought me to a I saw a sign for ribs outside. YES!
Short & sweet: Service was terrific. Ribs were meaty, tender and delicious. Such tastiness is worth a stop downtown."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've even been too, you will have enough food to yack it and take some home to go for under $15. I highly recommend it. So good makes me want to fly out to Vegas right now! :p"}
{"text":"Perfect example of a hidden gem on fremont! Great pricing on a small, but delicious menu.

Had the brisket and ribs. Ribs were falling off the bone and had a smokey flavor that i found to be extremely delicious. Brisket portions were ample and full flavored.

Had a couple of beers too. All Nighters. Also very delicious. 

Pricing was a value! We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"The whole reason I was in Vegas this time around was for a wedding and the bachelor party transpired mostly in Benny's Smokin BBQ and Brews. We started out in a private cigar room and eventually moved out to the restaurant itself for food.

It's an interesting menu in that there are only five options on offer and absolutely no appetizers or desserts. So I decided to go with the Smoked Brisket, which comes with BBQ Baked Beans, Corn on the Cob, Coleslaw & Corn Bread.

The whole thing is completely average, to be honest. The meat isn't even remotely smoky and hardly as tender as it should be, while the sides all taste as though they came out of a can or a mixture.

The ambiance is nice, at least."}
{"text":"Do not let Binions scare you, this place is the bomb despite the place looking like a time capsule out of the 1970's.  The ribs were tender and smoky, the brisket was juicy, and the prices were very reasonable.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night with 3 of my friends and was not impressed.  It was nice to be able to get a table with no wait and the service was good.  The ribs and chicken were cooked well, its just the sauce that comes with it was not very good.  We also had the draft Hefeweizen (called something else) but that was not good.  We ended up sending 2 glasses back to the bar since they had a rancid taste.  The beans were good and the portions were a healthy size.  All in all, its ok, but could be a lot better."}
{"text":"Ribs are great, cornbread and coleslaw are awesome as well. Fun and noisy sports bar feel, inside Binions casino. Menu is simple and easy and service is quick."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Full rack of ribs. Meat fell off of the bone. Great flavor. The sides were very good. Don't miss them. Fast service on all of our orders.
Our waitress was very attentive. She was the best.
If you get a chance don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"So F'n good.  And cheap.  If you have a players card it's even cheaper!  I will come back.  The ribs were great.  The chicken was so juicy.  Even the corn on the cob was awesome.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"After wandering around Fremont street for a bit, we stopped here for a bite. Be sure to join the players club do you can get $2 off your meals. We arrived about an hour before it closed on St Patrick's Day and got a table right away. I ordered the brisket and bae got the 1/2 chicken and 1/2 rack of ribs. It was all really good, but the chicken won the meal. I think the butter was unsalted, which threw me off, but the two types of bbq sauce on the table were delicious (bae really liked the hot and spicy). If you are on Fremont and feeling hungry, come in here. The price a right and the beers are only $5 for the big glass."}
{"text":"Very short menu but tasty ribs. Service was good. Drinks were an ample poor. We had a party of 8 and they won't split the check. Good but not spectacular"}
{"text":"Found this nice BBQ place inside Binions. What a lucky find!

Delicious BBQ at very affordable prices.  Make sure you show your players card to get the discounted price shown on the menu.

Friendly service and clean interior. There's about 30 or so tables and there may be a wait. But sit and eat at the bar to get service right away.

As soon as you enter there's a yummy, faint smell of BBQ.
I'm not one for fake BBQ sauce but my chicken BBQ order was delicious and the homemade sauce was really good!  

Downtown Vegas is the place to go for inexpensive but delicious dining.  And the casinos here have a better payout plus lower minimum bets.
Also a good place to experience vintage Vegas, which honestly is not as bad as it sounds.
It's a nice break from the tourist trap Strip which can get annoying at times."}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is WOW! Definitely a shocker that I experienced some of the best BBQ I've EVER HAD in my life inside of a Casino/Gambling hall in Vegas!!

We stumbled upon this gem purely by coincidence lol We parked in the Binion's Garage and just wanted to walk Fremont Street and play a bit and have dinner --but since every restaurant had a ridiculous wait...we ended up back @ Binion's. We were going to try the cafe or steakhouse, but the cafe had a long wait and the steakhouse was a bit pricy so we ended up @ Benny's. 

The wait was a little lengthy (I knew we should have just walked in here when we first arrived) but I must say it was worth it!!! We were seated and they have a really basic menu with pictures that do the food absolutely NO JUSTICE. I almost ordered 2 plates since the pictures were very basic & misleading but my cousin said to just wait and see if I was still hungry before ordering 2. With the menu being pretty limited (Ribs, Chicken, Brisket combos) I really think the prices were very reasonable and nothing was over $14. That was a major PLUS.

When they served the food, we were all actually pleasantly surprised at how huge the portions were...and DELICIOUS it was! All the sides were on hit (cornbread cupcake, chili & coleslaw)..one of my cousins even said the butter was yummy! lmao Oh & the BBQ sauce they have at the tables is super YUMM!!! I love my spicy BBQ sauce and they had a bottle of both Spicy & Mild...I smothered that all over my brisket which was just divine and tender -- just the way I like it! I also had a taste of my sister's ribs&chicken -- they were delicious as well! When my husband arrived a little later, we killed my brisket plate along w/ my sisters combo plate & he killed his brisket plate that I ordered when he got there lmao!!! Talk about being total gluts...but seriously, the food is THAT GOOD! I thought $150 (which included food, drinks, tip+tax) for 9 people was actually pretty reasonable....I would not hesitate to come here again & enjoy some fabulous BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

 Something new is smoking at Fremont Street. It ain't under the canopy. It is inside Binion's Gambling Hall. Benny's Smokin BBQ & Brews recently opened near the Binion's sports book.

  Last night my brother and I decided to give this place a try. I'd be a guinea pig and experience the newest BBQ restaurant in downtown. With that said, I observed that it is a streamlined operation. The hours are limited from 4 to 11p.m. They only serve dinner from a streamlined menu. There are only four entrees. Entree one is the full rack of baby back ribs for $15.99. Entree two is the half rack of baby back ribs for $10.99. Entree three is the half chicken for $10.99. And Entree four is the half rack and half chicken for $13.99. The Binion's card discounts each entree by $2. The first thing we did was sign up for the Binion's card to take advantage of the $2 discount. All the entrees include baked beans, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and cole slaw. 

  Regardless that there are signs advertising the restaurant and a local paper featured a column on it, Benny's Smokin BBQ & Brew was sparsely populated with patrons. Setting eyes on a dimly lit restaurant that resembles an Irish pub more than a BBQ joint, we sat ourselves. Faster than a hand of Blackjack,  the friendly waitress greeted us. On account of the streamlined menu, deciding what to order was easy. I ordered the half rack of BBQ ribs and BBQ chicken and not a brew but a Coke. 

  I give Benny's Smokin BBQ & Brew 3.5 stars, the equivalent of a \"B+\" on a report card. The ribs and chicken were tasty without all the stickiness. I only used a moderate amount of the roll of papertowels on the table. The ribs were easy to cut. This was not one of those messy BBQ disasters. I was satisfied with the ribs and chicken. And speaking for my brother so was he. What could I say about BBQ beans and a biscuit? They taste the same every place I eat them. I felt the corn on the cob could of been warmer. Just like anyplace I've been to, the cole slaw was delicious. 
  Sometimes, it pays to be a guinea pig. Now I know that when I am at the Fremont Street Experience and  have a craving for BBQ food all I have to do is walk to the back of Binion's."}
{"text":"Bbq had a great fkavor. The ribs and chicken were a little dry but still very good. Service was very good. Prices were very reasonable.  Much cheaper than the strip."}
{"text":"Probably the best food I've ever had in my life. 

But the service....

1. Waitress was incredibly slow to take our initial drink orders. The drinks themselves came fast but refills? Forget about it. I was the designated driver, paying the bill and drinking only water and never got my glass refilled. 

2. No thank you at the end. Just a \"Have a good one guys\" as the check was placed on the counter.

I'd come back for the food but walk out if I had the same waitress."}
{"text":"(It's in Binnions Casino)  We found out about Benny's threw our neighbor.  He ralked about how good it is.  Because he knows were into bbq.   Thee service was great,  I can't remember or servers name.  I think it was Jenny.  She was really nice.   There menu is very simple.  Ribs and chicken!   Do you want all ribs or all chicken, or do you want half and half!   It comes with delicious coleslaw,  bbq beans that taste so good, corn on the cob and cornbread.   I usually don't want time spend my money on bbg, cause we do oir own.  But this was really good.  They also have a nice beer menu.    I would eat here again if I get hungry on freamont st.  My combo was $11.99.  And I brought all my chicken home."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious! You can't make a wrong choice! Fall off the bone smoked to perfection ribs, juicy chicken and amazing brisket. Super fast and friendly service! All around good eats!"}
{"text":"OMG the ribs were fall off the bone tender.  I had the half rack ribs and half chicken dinner.   Way too much food.  Very flavorful. 

For much less than $20 I had a fantastic meal and drink.  Spent twice this amount for dinner last night on the strip and the food wasn't as good.  

Highly recommend you stop in if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I'm extremely surprised that this place has the good ratings that it does. The service was mediocre, the tables were dirty and the food had no taste. Additionally, I don't like the fact that their kitchen is not located inside the same area, so they actually have to walk from another area through the casino a little bit and then into the bar. The only good things are that the menu is uncomplicated and simple and the portion sizes are good. We took the leftovers home and fed them to our dogs."}
{"text":"The Brisket was sliced very thin and was quit chewy. The cornbread was dry and stale. The coleslaw was OK and the beans were very good. The food came cold but I just wanted to get the hell out so I held back. We were the only table sitting at the time which was 4 PM. Yes I stiffed the waitress. She spent her time talking at the bar. Service seems to be that way everywhere. Thank god I'm a good cook. Maybe that's why I'm complaining. Nobody knows how to cook."}
{"text":"My husband (an experienced smoker of meat) and I went here, and even though I loved the ribs, he said they were overdone (the meat literally fell completely off the bone). He didn't like the sauce on the meat, I didn't mind. He prefers the sauce on the side, but they don't offer it that way. The corn was awful, I didn't eat it. Cole slaw was plain, nothing to write home about. But, they waitress was very friendly, and they let us share a plate. I thought the price ($13 for a full rack of ribs with sides) was very fair. I liked it."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Benny's. It's a 21 and above place. The staff are very sweet and friendly. The menu is limited but it makes ordering quicker. They have some very delicious BBQ ribs. 

They also have a bunch of beers on tap.

Tonight I went in and ordered the full rack of baby back ribs 14 bones. It comes with delicious baked beans, coleslaw, corn on the cob and a cornbread muffin.

There are two sauces on the table to choose from...sweet or hot and spicy BBQ. I tried both and liked both of them.

The price is very affordable especially if you have a players card.

I'd be definitely coming back to get me BBQ on."}
{"text":"The chicken is decent but the brisket and ribs were lacking.  The baked beans came out of a can and the cornbread tasted like it was bought at A&P.  They don't even offer pulled pork.  I don't understand how a BBQ joint doesn't even have pulled pork.  I'm bewildered."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this little hidden gem in the back of Binions Casino. One of my favorite casual dining places in town.  

I always get the 1/2 rack of ribs, 1/2 bbq chicken dinner for a low price if $13.99.  I believe it is only $11.99 if you are a club member.  This meal also comes with Cole slaw, beans, corn, and cornbread.  I always think I can eat it all, and the reality is I can't even come close. (!)

Good service, good prices, and good food. What more could you ask for?  There are still good deals in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Terrific Food 4* out of 5, Great Service 5* and super cheap 5* so I'm giving them 5* overall.  I will definitely go back."}
