{"text":"Très pauvres comme menus et pour le brunch a 16$ une omelette et rien d autre comme accompagnement j ai due demander le pain !!"}
{"text":"While the waitress did not come to our table often i saw her running around the entire restaurant checking on her tables and at one point ran after a customer to give her the food she forgot. The pizza i got was awesome! It had peppers included but i am not a fan of peppers on pizzas so they made me my pizza without the peppers. :) i definitely want to go back and try more of their food."}
{"text":"First visit was impressive. We were well received. Good menu selection, I ordered the All Dressed Mini-pizza with a Cesar salade. I did not have the Minestrone soup, but those with whom I ate did and they enjoyed it. Apparently the Cheese and spinach cannelloni gratiné is very good also The service was quick and professional. Pricing is reasonable. Excellent value for you money."}
