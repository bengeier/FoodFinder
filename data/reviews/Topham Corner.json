{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the three different meals I've tasted at this gem in the neighborhood. The owners are very warm and the atmosphere is welcoming. I highly recommend TC and definitely try the chicken sandwich...it's to die for!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  The food was tasty - Got the fish and chips while a colleagues got the vegetarian sandwich.  The fish was great - not too greasy - but the star was the fries, which were VERY VERY good.  The only complaint was that that definitely wasn't tartar sauce on my plate as mentioned in the menu.  It was... It tasted like plain yogurt.  My colleague tried it and agreed.  A little strange but nothing to quibble over unless you love tartar sauce.  The atmosphere is very homey and laid back, and I loved the feel of the place.  A hidden gem."}
{"text":"I often come to this area because of parents at St Clair/O'Connor seniors' home, but have never been able to find a nice place for casual, independent, neighborhood, healthy eating. My search is over! There are lots of things I liked about this place.  Free-range eggs, and local greens. House-made sausage, baked goods and house-chopped veggies: all the ingredients that go into neighborhood-building B2B or business to business. Even the coffee comes from a local roaster (and tastes perfectly fresh as a result).  This is the way our local money can create local jobs -- truly local, as in the Topham neighbourhood, originally \"settled\" by World War 11 veterans during the 1950s.   As you might expect, freshly house-made makes for great taste and good economic value too. Last but not least, enjoyed having local jazz from CJRT in the background. The owner told me it was a labor of love; I hope others give back to her like she gives back to the neighborhood. It could help revive the whole main street!"}
{"text":"So glad to have this great spot in the neighbourhood.  Just had the best meal all fresh with great service.  Make sure you check it out.  I highly recommend the fish and chips"}
{"text":"Had such a lovely breakfast here!! The food was fresh and delicious, the atmosphere was warm and relaxed and you can really tell that the owner and staff put their heart into the place.   Plus there are games there!! So much fun on a Saturday afternoon while waiting for the food to come out.   Will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Relaxed vibe. Bottomless coffee. Visited on a Friday night and they had a live guitarist performing. And free wi-fi!"}
{"text":"We were at this restaurant, picked on the basis of Yelp reviews and its convenient location, for an absolutely fun, celebratory family dinner on a Saturday night in September. The party size swelled by three last minute, and we were accommodated by the kind and friendly owners and staff. Parking was easily found by each of us. White table linens and candles on the tables made for a lovely ambience.   I was served a Texan size braised beef short rib, fall-off-the-bone & paired with horseradish smashed red potatoes.  In-house made apple & strawberry rhubarb pies and properly crisp pavlova were ordered by various of the party for dessert, and much savored.  The young ones of the party had a ball playing Jenga at the games table!  The only reason I am unable to give 5 stars is that not everyone in my party were equally enthused by their (different) meal selections, feeling their servings on the small side and a little underseasoned."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot. The atmosphere and the food is super cozy. Service is friendly. I have been here a handful of times for lunch, and have never been disappointed. A great place to take an extended lunch break. Good ole home style food done right. The $12 lunch is good value. Really nothing bad to say here... if the dinner vibe is anything like lunch than this place has it figured out."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with my breakfast and the level of service here that I returned for lunch and brought my husband.  This cozy little bistro has such a homey feeling with it's rustic/shabby chic interior (Cathy is the one with the artistic eye), smooth jazz playing in the background and warm and welcoming staff. This is the type of place where you need to take off your coat, get comfy and prepare yourself for a lovely time.   This establishment is owned and run by a wonderful couple: Cathy and Bill Martin. They have only been in business for 12 weeks but they are constantly working on growing and developing their business. Everything is locally sourced (delicious coffee from Cultured Coffee, artisanal breads from Freds Bread) and they bake their pastries, hand cut their fries, grind their meats for their burgers and sausages all in house. Everything is fresh, fresh, fresh and is so evident as you savor each and every bite of their food.  For breakfast I had the Veggie Breakfast Wrap (actually 2 tacos see pic) with a side of Pork Sausages (ground and made in house). I've never had a veggie main dish that I could describe as savory before until now. It paired well with the sausages which had outstanding flavor but was dry. I brought this to the attention of one of the owners and he said he would work on correcting that; but in the mean time, he told his cook to whip up a sauce for it. I kid you not when I say the sauce was so good that I actually brought the little container of it home so I wouldn't waste a drop of it.  For lunch I had the Potato and Leek soup and house salad combo.  The salad was peppery and went well with the mild flavored soup. Tried the Chive Buttered Hand Cut Fries which were good but in my opinion needed a spicy dipping sauce to accompany it. No prob, Bill went to his cook and asked her to come up with a sweet and spicy sauce yum!  By the recommendation of Bill, hubby got the Chicken Fried Chicken Sandwich. The chicken was tender and juicy on the inside with a crispy coating, the coleslaw added a wonderful crunch from the fresh veggies and the soft bun had a touch of sweetness to it: a harmonious and wonderful blend of flavors and textures.  I'll definitely be back to try their dinner where they bring out the tablecloths and candles (available Thur, Fri and Sat only)."}
{"text":"Excellent! The place is lovely and clean, the staff are lovely and the food is absolutely delicious. I had the brisket breakfast and it was totally fantastic."}
{"text":"Lovely casual spot on O'Connor that's family friendly.  Lots of parking on the side street and the back of the restaurant.  We came for brunch with friends and kids and everyone left fairly satisfied.  Their soup of the day was excellent.  The roast pork sandwich I had didn't have the right kind of bread as it was a baguette.  They have deceivingly large portions from the kids menu and added some peas to their pasta upon my request (thank you!).  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal though my husband didn't love the brisket hash as he found it on the drier side.  All in all, will likely go back and try some other stuff.  Oh and they have an array of board games to play while you wait or more so for the evening (and yes, they are licensed!)."}
{"text":"A great new addition in East York. I really enjoyed my burger. It was perfect. My hubbie had short ribs and it was really good too. Atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"$11.50 sausage, eggs, hash and bread. $2.50 unlimited coffee. Not bad. Hash was very different from the usual but I don't hate it! Great service, lovely owners and there's a patio to enjoy the food. What we got was the standard fare so I can't really say there was anything crazy special about it. I did enjoy the atmosphere of the place, very cozy and chill.   They take all methods if payment."}
{"text":"It's great to have this place in the neighborhood!  Went here for breakfast the other day, and had the scrambled egg sandwich on brioche.  All of the food was high quality.  The portions are good, not huge, but the food itself is delicious.  Friendly service, very laid back and homey atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. Very friendly staff, family-run with great service. Brisket Benny was delicious & prices were very reasonable for Toronto."}
