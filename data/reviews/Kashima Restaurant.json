{"text":"Normalement j'adore la nourriture japonnaise voilà pourquoi je fut très surprise par la très bonne cote de ce restaurant. Le service était attentionnné mais malheureusement la nourriture était sans gout. Il faut par contre dire que je n'ai pas essayé les sushi, qui j'ose croire, valent les 4 étoiles données par mes autres compatriotes yelpers!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for sushi in my neighbourhood!  I imagine it's a lunch and dinner/takeout go-to for many others as well, although I do not find that it is very busy at dinner.  The decor is a step above many other sushi places, very clean and nice, but not terribly exciting.  Service is attentive enough, although the servers seem a little timid.  I have no complaints though.  The menu is very standard but where this place is a winner is that it is superb value, with big portions of good quality fish for very reasonable prices.  Good value combos.  The sashimi is among the best I've had in Montreal, where sashimi is usually code for high prices and average (or below average) fish.  I've been here 4 or 5 times now and it's been consistent every time.  I wouldn't seek it out for a romantic meal or a really adventurous menu, but I would definitely recommend this place if you have a weeknight sushi craving or for takeout."}
{"text":"Really like this restaurant! Good prices for the quality of sushi you get : fresh, tasty, descent sizes. Staff is pretty friendly. Have to go back to try their teriyaki!"}
{"text":"Great quiet atmosphere, decoration, and music suitable for a family or couples. The menu was varied and the quality of the food was very good at a fair price. Overall a great find that exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place as it is in the lovely fancy area of Greene avenue . Was a big disappointment!!! Overpriced sushi that is below average quality. We asked for a chef special sushi for 2 , was a horrible choices in every way . Fish didn't taste fresh at all , shrimp tasted raw and not marinated enough . Damage was 100$ , didn't worth at all , never again ."}
{"text":"We're generally die-hard Bistro Furusato fans (the sashimi platter is an amazing deal!) but I actually think we like Kashima's even more. In contrast to Furusato (which I think could use some improvements in decor), Kashima has a much nicer ambiance and feels more upscale (while actually being cheaper).  Sushi and sashimi were top quality and you have a nice variety of platters to choose from. Hubby chose a platter with ~6 sashimi pieces, ~6 nigiri pieces, 1 maki roll, miso soup, salad, shrimp and veggie tempura, and yakitori for only $30!   Similar to another reviewer, I do think the rolls with tempura flakes have a lot of tempura flakes and the rolls are generally a bit larger than your standard \"sushi shop\" size. But, the rice layer is fairly thin, so I didn't feel that the extra flakes was to serve as filler. The proportions of the other ingredients were consistent with what you would want, and personally I liked the extra crunch. If sushi isn't your thing, there are many teriyaki/udon/katsu options as well. Service was great even though it was a full house. I'm already daydreaming about the next time we'll be coming back here..."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times over the years as it is located around the corner where I used to live. The sushi was always very good. They also have very affordable and tasty lunch specials."}
{"text":"I am a Montreal native and I've had sushi at most sushi restaurants in the city, but no restaurant has been so consistently good and reasonable priced as Kashima. Kashima has changed menus and owners several times these past few years, and needless to say, the prices have also gone up.  Despite this, it is still among the tastiest and freshest sushi in town.  I am updating my previous review and here are some comments on the sushi I had last night.  Spicy tuna - one of the best rolls - fresh, perfectly balanced, and well proportioned so that you can actually eat it with the chop stick and it doesn't come part. The tuna melts in your mouth and there is just enough mayo to make it spicy.  Westmount with salmon & tuna - a solid roll, a bit on the large side but thin enough so you don't make a mess while eating it. Flavourful - its deep fried edges gives it a pleasant texture without being too oily.  Kamikaze 3 - it was just 'ok' - I remember when under a previous owner I used to have to specially request extra crispy tempura flakes because they did not put enough - those days are long gone. Now, the roll is overpacked with them, making it way too large. Are the extra flakes being used to justify the higher prices - and being put in the place of more fish?  Montreal - This roll substitutes rice with tempura flakes - a less tasty version of the Kamikaze in my opinion. Again, way too much tempura - not sure what purpose it serves. I also didn't like that I had to use my hands to eat it and that it constantly came apart in the process.   I was happy overall, but until those speciality rolls become better proportioned in size, I'm going to stick to the smaller, simpler, and more traditional rolls."}
{"text":"The food is great! Japanese waitresses are always a plus, the only negative point was that the restaurant lacked ambiance music. Totally recommended! Grab a few dishes and share them! Tempura + soup +  beef teriyaki = delightful!"}
{"text":"Service is fast. Got take out but you can dine in as well.   The rolls were decent in terms of flavour but were too big to eat in one bite. Falls apart when you try to eat it in two bites."}
{"text":"I decided to try a new sushi place tonight (Monday night) instead of my usual spots. Boy oh boy am I happy I did!  We were a party of 5 and the place was very quiet (only 3 other parties) - we ordered 70 sushi rolls and a few sashimi, and it was the perfect amount. Every single one was *really* enjoyed by each one of us - with the Hawaiian roll being the crowd favourite. It was out of this world!  Pineapple is unexpected but super delicious!  I will definitely be back!  And on the plus side, parking is free in Westmount on Mon-Wed after 6pm (not like elsewhere downtown)! Fantastic resto. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Great place, their bento boxes are super good. I like to go there for business meetings too as it is never too loud, you can hear very well what the people with you are saying. Food is good and service also very good"}
{"text":"we had a nice dinner at Kashima this weekend. The sushi was fresh, tasty and plentiful. there are a number of interesting rolls i'd never tried before, as well as sushi pizza!? pretty neat. the meal was great although the service was really slow. they seemed to forget about us after our food was brought out.   standouts were the softshell crab roll, spicy tuna roll and the westmount roll."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to lunch at Kashima last week during the first snow of the winter in Montreal. It's lovely to duck up the stairs out of the very Westmount vibes on Greene Avenue and into the calm of this simple, lovely second floor restaurant.   Service is calm, prompt and professional and perfectly in keeping with the whole vibe. Menu is affordable and appealing. My friend loves the maki rolls here so he dug into those with delight, and I took a chance on the vegetarian udon soup. I was not disappointed! The soup was totally delicious, savoury broth, lovely chewy noodles, just great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat sushi in town. Here, you get a great sushi for a reasonable price"}
{"text":"I've been going for a few years now and have never been disappointed. Sushi is extremely fresh and the portions for the maki is generous. Also great value for lunch. Definitely my go to sushi place when I don't want to go to the all you can eat Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Descent sized portions! The service is mediocre, and the food is a bit underwhelming. The staff was nice, but seemed a bit lost (or just very impersonal). This is a good place to check out, however, I will, personally, not go back as there are substantially better places out there, even though this is closer."}
