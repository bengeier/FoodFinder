{"text":"Driving from LBI to Chicago and read the reviews on this hidden gem!!  The atmosphere at the lodge reminded me of a supper club in Wisconsin. RUN...Don't walk: Amazing Food and Service!  The burgers were awesome!  Our kids had pasta and then vanilla ice cream with berries and Carmel sauce and a chocolate cake with Carmel sauce, whipped cream.   We will definitely be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Great option if you're looking to get away from the chain restaurants in Streetsboro! Went for drinks and apps while back home visiting some family. So happy to have this as an option. The drinks were insanely good and the apps hit the spot. Great atmosphere all around."}
{"text":"Good burgers and an EXCELLENT patio. Great place in the summer. A little dark inside, thus the reason why I prefer the patio."}
{"text":"I dined here with a group of five ladies last night. We had a great experience! The decor is awesome, it will be SO cozy and cute in the winter months with all the stone, old barn beams, and the giant stone fireplace. Very picturesque. They also have paint nights and other fun events. I could see this being a great venue for a party, too. I am a cheeseburger girl and definitely judge a restaurant on how well they prepare a good ol' burger, and they hit the nail on the head with the one I ordered! I got the burger that had BBQ sauce, American cheese, and onion rings on and it was so delish. Ordered medium and came out medium. Burger was huge, well seasoned, messy as hell, and even tho I'm pregnant and don't have much room to fit a full meal in my belly, I gobbled that SOB right up! Others had the Cajun shrimp pasta, Caesar salad wit salmon, calamari appetizer, and another salad (can't remember which) and raved about their meals. The bar had a decent selection of tap beers, and one of the gals in our group got an old fashioned that she enjoyed. The place was pretty much dead on a Thursday evening, so I REALLY hope it can stick around. GET OUT THERE ANS SUPPORT THIS LOCAL BUSINESS! I will be back with my hubs so he can try it out ASAP."}
{"text":"We live in Streetsboro and decided to finally try The Lodge for a quick kid-free date night.  They've done a great job with decor and atmosphere - it looks beautiful!

It was 6pm on a Saturday and we were the only people on the restaurant side for most of our visit.  Service was good, and we enjoyed our meals and dessert.  We got chicken and waffles, a burger, fries, and a chocolate mousse dessert.  Everything was good and we would definitely go back, especially in the summer to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"When I followed a moose head in the back of a truck halfway home one night, I was a little disturbed and sad for the moose.  Well, it turns out he found a new home at The Lodge, along with a few bears and a deer.  So I guess, right off the bat, if you don't want to dine with that kind of thing this isn't the place for you.   But, if you have kids, they will enjoy the high-fiving bear that greets you as you walk in. 

HOWEVER, The Lodge is actually really cool with a BEAUTIFUL bar, bourbon barrels (well, I'll pretend they're bourbon), cool light fixtures, and exposed beams.  Having just returned from Gatlinburg, it was very Gatlinburg-esque really. 

We started with their special of shrimp cocktail and that was delish, but my favorite dish of the night was the butter bib salad - crunchy candied pecans, goat cheese, dried cranberries, etc.  The dressing was to die for.  It was probably one of the best salads I've ever eaten!  The lettuce was just SO good!  That was followed by the special buffalo chicken flatbread for my husband (a little blue cheese heavy for me) and I had the pulled pork flatbread.  It was a little sweeter than I expected (I thought it said Carolina bbq so I was hoping for more of a vinegary kick) but was super tasty.

You must get their Bloody Mary if you like spicy things!  I had a Moscow mule that was so refreshing, I can't seem to get enough of them lately.  

Finally, we were a little concerned that they wouldn't be kid-friendly but we were wrong!  They have a few highchairs and boosters, a kids menu (the pasta with marinara was well-received), and the nice hostess even brought us crayons and a coloring book. We try to dine early with our kids and timed it well as they started getting busy as we left.

Staff was all super friendly.  We can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!!!  Our waitress said they are working on their dessert menu and fingers crossed it will be blessed with a nutty brownie for this girl!"}
{"text":"Been to the Lodge twice now with my wife and both times have been outstanding. The draft beer selection is the best in the area. My wife loved the infused vodka strawberry lemonade. The menu has a nice variety that will satisfy any and all comers. The decor is impeccable and the patio with the waterfall is soothing. This restaurant will become the gem of Streetsboro."}
{"text":"Excellent burger...  Great restaurant.  Service was fast.  Prices average.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Never open when advertised even though big sign in the front...we have tried for brunch and dinner..."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch, there wasn't a lot of customers because school started. The atmosphere is very rustic. Service was friendly. The potato soup was good and the calamari was well seasoned. I didnt care for the marinara sauce that accompanied the calamari. It tasted like bland pizza sauce. My husband didn't care for his flatbread. He said the sauce was like plain pizza sauce. He preferred the flatbread he ate at Glenwillow Grille. I would like to try the crab cakes my husband said he wasn't impressed. The Lodge gets 3 stars due to split decision."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a sunny Sunday.  
Not packed, but about a half dozen tables taken.  
Easy to park.
Gorgeous rustic cabin like interior. 
We were greeted and sat promptly.
Our server was very friendly.

Unsweetened Ice tea & coffee were good.
Coconut shrimp app was tasty, make sure to eat some of the mango salsa on with each bite! Yum.
I got a regular salad and added chicken.  It was fresh and good.  I asked if they could blacken the chicken ( you know, w/cajun seasoning), and our server said she would see if they could.  I said it was fine if they couldn't.  But when she brought it, she said that they had some Cajun seasoning on there, but there really wasn't.  It lasted like plain chicken.  The ranch dressing is ok, a little watery.   
The Tuscan chix sandwich was ok.  A little bland.  Fries were good.  Sicilian flat bread was ok, the red sauce had a bit of a different flavor then I am use too.   

All in all, I would definitely come back to try other foods."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to check out The Lodge on Saturday night when we were in town and had a really great time. The food was AWESOME. We waited a bit longer for our food than you would normally expect but the servers were so great that we honestly didn't mind. Great service! We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Really, really slow service. We heard the table behind us complain about the bill being wrong. Same issue with us! Several up charges for drinks that weren't warranted. Waitress went to fix several times and still wrong. We will never go back. Also food was sub par at best!"}
