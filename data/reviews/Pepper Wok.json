{"text":"The spaghetti  i ordered was just like a kid meal, even though as afternoon tea meal cheaper than regular order, still not acceptaible."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday during lunch. Not busy at all. Service was pretty good. Staff was polite. Food and price were decent too.   I ordered pork chop with vermicelli in curry soup. It came with two eggs, a toast and a drink. All for $6.99."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant.... They change the menu from time to time. Love their Hainan style chicken and rice, Taiwanese style spicy beef noodle, tan-tan noodle and lot more."}
{"text":"Okay restaurant for affordable food.  Decent comfort food for a good price.   Warning, it is a small restaurant that fits about 32 people so if its fully seated you're only about 1 inch from the other person's jacket.   Beware of where you sit, the draft from the door can be quite chilly in the winter.  Lots of specials on the wall, and in their menu. See photos attached. Some comes with drinks, some comes with drinks and salad and soup, some doesn't.   Service is okay, nothing crazy above expectation   STEAK DEAL for $11.99 you can get a sizzling steak that comes with a drink, soup and salad!! Not bad.  Their HAIANESE CHICKEN RICE is not bad too for $8.99.   Overall if I'm not expecting for anything fancy and just something quick and filling, I would come here. Just at the back of the plaza.  This plaza is sometimes hard to find parking though."}
{"text":"The restaurant is okay. Nothing special. It was just recently opened in the summer of 2010 I believe. I'm a fan of Jubilee cafe, and this doesn't quite compare. IT is newer, so it gets points for that.   But the food isn't quite on par to Jubilee cafe. Food comes on time for sure. It's also a bit pricier by a bit, but it's still cheap.  This is a good restaurant alternative to Jubilee Cafe. It isn't quite as busy either, so you don't have to wait for seats there, whereas Jubilee is usually packed."}
{"text":"very yummy hong kong style egg sandwich, warm and juicy!  keep in mind that the shop closes early at 9pm on weekdays i think."}
{"text":"this place has specials every week. and apparently that's the only thing they can make. they have a large menu, but when i ordered something off the menu (baked pork chop in tomato sauce) they said there no baked available (it's on their regular menu!), and suggested something else on their daily specials menu. she said it was the same. it was NOTHING alike and was one of the worst lunches I had ever had from there. After this experience, I know to never order lunch from them again. there are way better lunches around this area and for a better price."}
{"text":"i think that this place is better than the three star rating it currently has. it's got a unique twist on traditional hong kong restaurants, which is flavorful and delicious. i really really like the vermicelli that they offer, it's not the usual threadlike hard rice noodle. it's chewier in a good way. on the other hand, though, they do well at replicating the best / typical things of hong kong cheap cuisine. for example, the sandwiches come in thickly sliced bread, which i think is more fluffy and tastes better than plain old thin toast. they also managed to make the french toast taste basically the same as the ones you get in hong kong, much better than the other places in the gta that i've tried french toasts at."}
{"text":"Mediocre quality. Too salty. There are so many other choices of similar cuisine nearby. This one is not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for quick lunch on a whim and was surprised at how decent it was and so cheap.  It's your typical HK style cheap cafe!  I ordered spring rolls (came with 4) and a dumpling soup.  The Soup was a nice large size with noodles and choy sum with some nice pork and chive dumplings.  Menu's are on the wall.  Not extreme gourmet but Mcdonald's prices for better quality!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Pepper Wok has been here for a long time, but it's located in a plaza where I tend to overlook since there aren't a lot of restaurants that attract me for dinner. After accidentally wandering into this plaza, I took a look at restaurant options available and decided on Pepper Wok.  The place is quite small and the interior looks very dated, but it seems to be good for the demand it gets. The menu also looked like it hasn't been updated in years, and reading the reviews here looks to affirm my claim.  I ordered the Emmentaler Sausages and Pork Chop on Spaghetti, as not many HK style cafe places offer German sausages. It came with a drink and a Chinese-style starter soup. The iced lemon tea was quite good, and the starter soup was okay as well.  As for my main course, I have to say the sausages were better than I thought..they were at least the large and juicy kind. For $8.99 I honestly didn't expect much, but I actually enjoyed my food overall. The pork chop wasn't the best I've had, but I've definitely had worse out there.  Service is as good as it gets, considering there's only a single lady taking orders, pouring tea/water, making drinks, AND doing the cashier. They could hire one more, but the size of the restaurant definitely limits that.  If you're looking for an extremely low cost meal without the eye candy, Pepper Wok is a good option for the area."}
{"text":"Pros: Good value  Cons: Not too much variety  Came by here for a Saturday afternoon lunch.  Pepper Wok is your standard HK style cafe. It's not the best, but it's not the worst.  You will get good value for your money though.    Pepper Wok is a pretty small place.  They manage to fit 8-10 tables in there but if it's busy, expect to wait a little bit. Looking at the menu, they have a lot of categories, but not many items per category.  It's a pretty bis menu page wise, but in the end, there's not too many items to choose from.  There are daily specials to choose from and those are the only ones that will come with a drink.  Anything else, and you'll have to pay full price for the drink.  I ordered the baked chicken on rice with mushroom sauce and my GF ordered the baked fish on spaghetti with cream sauce.  An egg sandwich was also ordered for my little one.  The food comes out pretty quick after you order.  The dishes were all pretty well done and had good portions for the price.  It was an enjoyable meal throughout.  I'm used to HK style cafes now offering a drink with any entree purchase so I missed having a drink with my entree.  It's not a deal breaker, but something noteworthy.  The service here was pretty standard, nothing of note to mention.  Basically, my visit here seemed to follow that theme here.  It's not too noteworthy, nothing special, nothing horrible.   If I'm in the area and feel like HK style cafe food, I would definitely consider Pepper Wok a good option.  As I said, you can probably find better, but you also can't go wrong here too."}
{"text":"Awful experience!!  Mediocre quality of food!!  Ordered breakfast...chicken, toasts, radish cake & lemon tea.  Salty greasy breakfast not to mention server messed up my simple order...got hot chocolate instead of lemon tea.  Never going back again."}
{"text":"Came here for our last meal (breakfast) before leaving Canada to go back home.  The menu selection is great, with lots of things to choose from.  The ham macaroni is good, and the instant noodle is great also.  The milk tea is very nice.  It is a small, family owned business, and we are satisfied.  As a typical Chinese restaurant, remember its cash only."}
{"text":"Pepper Wok still the same since my last visit.. similar pricing, similar specials..  I was here though for their Hainanese Chicken with Rice ($7.50). Boneless chicken was great for lazy person like me... soft and well flavoured. The rice though definitely the star of the dish, fragranted and garnished with ginger and garlic. I ate the whole plate all by myself.........and I am not a rice lover.  Huge portion and at a reasonable price.. great meal for under $10! What more can I ask for?"}
