{"text":"The staff was very attentive and made suggestions when I inquired about the portions. I was served by Pauline, and she advised me to pick the mushroom and garlic bread that was freshly made. I ordered a decent sized Veal sandwich for $6.69 that tasted fresh. I finally found somewhere in the plaza that makes me look forward to lunch."}
{"text":"I have frequented this establishment several times and have always walked away satisfied. This is a hot table style eatery, with good traditional Italian food and friendly service. Prices are reasonable and I always eat here when in the area."}
{"text":"A university pal who is a regular here talked it up on several occasions so when we met up before the holidays for lunch I was pretty excited to get my tavola calda (Italian for hot table) on.

It's right next door to Union social eatery in the midst of this busy lunchtime plaza so plan ahead or know that you'll be parking on the far side of the lot.

It's a warm cozy atmosphere and that extends to the staff working the counter ready to fulfill your order. There was a lunch special but I was so hungry I glazed past it and just mumbled some words and ended up with a large piece of Eggplant Parmigiana and a salad. The EpP was so good, so many layers of perfectly cooked and breaded eggplant, topped in sauce and then you can pretty much go buck wild with a the parmesan cheese shaker at your table. The salad, was salad and the dressed was a tasty but standard fare.

Price was very good, only came out to $14 all in for a full meal and a drink, tax in, plus it was quick. The rest of the hot table looked incredible as well, so I expect I'll be coming back for a lunch meet up with a \"friend\" in the future (I'll actually totally be all by myself, shame eating/cheating on my New Years diet.... please don't tell my Fiance√©).

Large portions of great Italian eats at a great price, can't go wrong!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"As I now work in Mississauga, I have been trying out new restaurants over my lunch hour in this neighbourhood.

Visited with a co-worker for lunch last week and had an ok meal. Ordered the veggie stuffed pepper which same with a side of veggies, greek salad and small piece of cheese pizza.

The food was good but nothing really stood out. Honestly it was overall a bit bland and I had to add salt (which I rarely do these days) to bring out some flavour in the stuffed pepper. The veggies tasted possibly frozen but the greek salad was fresh and delicious. Portion was huge!

I would return again to try something else as the ladies at the counter were so lovely when they served us. Maybe next time will be better!"}
{"text":"I work across the street from this place and love their food. My favourite is their penne with grilled chicken, pizza, and steak or grilled chicken hot sandwiches. They have a variety of bread that you can choose. Their price is very reasonable/cheap with great portions. I have been here 20 times already in the last few months and regularly order their take out. You might be able to get 15% off as they give this out if you work for certain company. Ask the owner if you quality for 15% off VIP card. I like this place more then many Italian places around GTA that even charges way more and not that great. I went to Earls last night and their pasta is crap compared to Focacia...LOVE THIS PLACE! :)"}
{"text":"WOW!  We bought a Dealfind takeout coupon for one of their 9 serving lasagnas.  I was really looking forward to it but boy were we disappointed.  Lots of tender pasta noodles but once you get past the top layer of cheese there is hardly any sauce or meat.  Very bland taste.  I really don't think that the noodles were even freshly made.  They looked and tasted boxed.  We paid $16.00 for the promo but the regular cost is stated at $43.00 which is unbelievably high for what we got.  Even at $16.00 I feel like we got ripped off.

I hope for their sake that they improve their food or they will not be around for very long."}
{"text":"I've been here few time for lunches and was always pleased with the food. Great portion and tasty food. I usually order the spaghetti with tomato sauce and it comes with garlic bread. Last time, I tried their hot sandwich. They bake their own bread and have a great selection to choose from for your sandwich.  It was good but I just wish they have toasted the bread. The man that works there (probably the owner) is also very nice and friendly. I will come back."}
{"text":"I drop by from work for lunch sometimes and go with the lunch special \"table\"...pretty solid stuff I get the lasagna, meatball or chicken parm and veggies....solid better than average fast food...great service but prices are a little high but it's Canada"}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all.  I was excited to find an Italian eatery on the food plaza here.

Upon ordering, the server was trying to push some lunch special to me.  Since I was ordering for a group, I opted to go with the initial order... 4 Lasagna to go.
The order taker was so pressed on her specials pitch... that I noticed salads being made and small... tiny squares being cut and placed in the containers.  Than I was asked what meat would I like...?  This was when I realized I was being served their lunch special.  I clarified that I did not want that and only their Lasagna.
After being schooled on MY error when placing the order... I had to pay the difference.  Than they cut another TINY piece to add to the first piece... and said... Ah, it all goes down the same way.  WTF!

Brought it back to the office and.... IT WAS THE WORST! BLAND TASTING.
No one liked it.  I was so disappointed in the food.. but that could have been 1 dish they were not good at... it would not have been a deal breaker to give it another try.  However, I would never go back for the service given."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a group and the reviews were mixed. A co-worker reported that the fettuccine with alfredo sauce and sausage was really good. The chicken parmesan sandwich was good. I had their special, which was the fettuccine with rose sauce and shrimp. It was mediocre. The bread that was included with the special was stale.

The one striking problem with this establishment was that the kitchen kept getting the orders wrong. The person who received the fettuccine with alfredo ordered a penne with alfredo sauce. He first received a penne with marinara, which was sent back, and settled on the second thing they gave him -- the fettuccine with alfredo. We also ordered 2 specials, and the kitchen only produced 1. I witnessed another patron at the restaurant finally receive what she ordered (she must have settled on what they sent out earlier) when she was about to leave. This place sounds like a good candidate for Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares."}
