{"text":"I had the #17 combination with shrimp. The shrimp was cold and the sauce had too many onions and peppers. Be sure you pay with cash as they charge an additional fee for using debit card."}
{"text":"The food is reasonably priced, the service is excellent but not too Impressed with the Food or my experience. I ordered a Torta and it was very simple not much flavor at all! Their salsas are watered down. I did love the pickled jalapeños and carrots thought. The reason why I'm giving such a low score is because when I get there before I ordered i asked for the restroom she said, no you can't use it I'm cleaning it right now, really you are cleaning the bathrooms as she is carrying some used paper towels and a bottle of windex. I still placed my order I observed her she continued so help people she did not wash her hands! Yeah needless to say I did not enjoy my Torta and will not be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican food spots in the area. The food is freshly made, with a wide variety of food types. I love their Arizona burrito, just amazing. They also have daily specials, and 24 hour drive thru. I always love to go to these types of family owned restaurants, 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner last week, and my husband LOVED the fish tacos!  The kids ate quesidillas, and we fed the entire family for around $30.  Great food and great prices."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food. Best thing open 24 hours!! Egg chorizo burrito is pretty good."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone is raving about this place.  My husband and I just moved into the area and we were looking for a good place to enjoy good breakfast burritos that had a drive thru. We read the reviews about this place and assume we couldn't go wrong.  Boy was that a mistake.  I got the potato, egg and cheese and it was so dry the only thing that made it edible was my homemade salsa.  My husbands chorizo burrito was so overcooked that it was inedible.  Why was shocking because I have never seen him put food aside no matter how bad.  We couldn't believe that they would put out food that was such poor quality.  He works in the food industry and commented that if one of his employees ever served food that bad he would fire them.  Instead of going back and giving the manager an earful we decided we would never go back.  We just realized that we read all the great reviews and were burned so we decided to write an honest one in case there are any people with standards looking forward to a great meal, so they aren't greatly disappointed.  That is the least we can do for fellow foodies."}
{"text":"Still love what I order every time and they are very consistent!

I moved a bit further away and crave my Herreras fix.

Here is the update menu with currant prices as of 4-15-2017"}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least 50 times. Normally get an Arizona burrito with a side of guacamole. It has everything you need. Meat cheese tortilla potatoes and guac! I have never had a bad experience here, except that time they forgot my guac! Yes I was distraught... But I still had a burrito. Super nachos are good as well for those late night after bar times. Better than filibertos IMO."}
{"text":"Their Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays specials are still good and the prices went up from $1 to $1.29 or $2.09.  Mondays are bean burritos, Tuesdays are 3 taquitos w/ cheese, both at $1.29; and on Thursdays are cheese quesadillas at $2.09.  They have thicken the refried beans a little which is much better than bean soup.  The prices of their breakfast burritos are still overpriced.  Everything else is still expensive but some of the food is still good."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I've been coming here often. This is just a sum of my overall experience thus far. The Carne asada, the shredded beef and chicken is seasoned decently. Not the greatest but it does the job. The Carne asada taco salad is very filling and is consistently good. Fish tacos are consistently good. Food overall is decent and consistent.

Service: not so much. There have been plenty of times where I have ordered for me and my wife. Other times for a much larger group. They have consistently forgotten food and/or the extra stuff I've ordered like salsa or the onion and cilantro-their \"pico\". Sometimes you are greeted warmly and feel welcomed. Other times its a time where you catch them in a not so pleasant mood. But that only entails less warmth and a look of \"why are you here?\" I wonder if this is because another late night place opened close to them?

Over all I think imma stay back from this place for a bit. See what happens at a later time. I think I used the word consistent too much. But it's vital to the service industry."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Used to drive all the way out here when I lived in surprise. Just so happens I live right around the corner from it now.  It's very dangerous. Food is really good. Not even comparable to the bertos or Rico's. We above.  Got my order wrong once and next time I went in they made it better, without me even bringing it up, they did it in their own. Only complaint I have, which is very small, is sometimes in the drive thru they forget to put salsa in the bag. It's a mood killer for sure. Who can eat Mexican food without salsa? Haha."}
{"text":"The food is good. well your typical fast mexican food. But you need to watch what you order because a combo can cost more than if you piece your order. for example the# 22 combo witch is a the meat to carne asada they charge $2 more. if you order the carne asada chimichanga by itself its only $0.81 cents difference than the beef or chicken. So just be carefull guys. the cashier gives you old we do what the customer orders excuse.!"}
{"text":"Use to be real good but they can't even get my order right it's the 6th time there's a Juliabertos right up the street on 75th and cactus much better service and good Quality and will replace  messed up orders"}
{"text":"My five stars are for the green chili. Served piping hot and the salsas bar are spicy and authentic. I noticed cops and Hispanics eat here often. Giant homemade tortilla and received bean burritos are only $1.29 on Mondays, add cheese and onion for a little more. Daily special board for Monday through Friday. Tasty De-lish!"}
{"text":"Beans and rice are made fresh.  Salsa and chip bar is refreshing. Carne asada meat is moist and flavorful"}
{"text":"average food. 

slightly burned carne asada  taco. meat was old or just burned. 

Shredded beef taco was okay.

salsa bar above average.
  

Last ate here 6 years ago food hasn't changed.

overall average food."}
{"text":"The most disgusting experience I have ever had!  All three meals with raw tortillas, raw chicken, old cheese, old beans, never go there!  A picture says a thousand words!"}
{"text":"Herrera's is better than alot of other Mexican food places in the area and their one dollar bean burrito Mondays are very good in the burrito and on the chips."}
{"text":"I am so sick and tired of coming to this Mexican restaurant for a $5 burrito and not getting what I order. I order a carne asada burrito every single time I come to one of these places. And this place which happens to be right behind my house always shorts me on my  guacamole always always always.. the last time this happened I tried to bring my burrito back in return it but they would not accept it and told me that I had to buy another one. You know what after tonight I will start going to 75th Avenue and cactus to that fast food Mexican place to order Mexican food. I don't care about the convenience of being right next to my house you guys suck. If you want you can either make it up to me and buy my family dinner or I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever come back to your restaurant ever I promise! Give me what I pay for when I order it don't Short me and then have me eat a dry nasty onion field cilantro covered burrito with steak and no guacamole"}
{"text":"I went there today and got Carne Asada fries they are always to die for but not today the frys are really old and nasty like they were microwaved I could have made way better it's really disappointing because I never expected them to give nasty ass food if it was them they wouldn't eat it for sure"}
{"text":"I love the food and the staff. Always a smile, and hot food. Love the rolled tacos...guac..flan...churro. I could go on. 
I have been going here for sometime at all hours. It is nice to have a place open 24/7 drive thru.  Honestly I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"A fine example of authentic Mexican food. Great place to go if you have a hell of an appetite as the servings are plentiful. Sides of rice and beans giant burrito and the beverages are great!"}
{"text":"Came here with mixed feelings as I been told they are good to they are bad. So I cane with an open mind. We we tried a few different things and it was all good hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Herrera's is probably better then every mexican food joint in its category. I'll even go as far as better than most fancy mexican restaurants. The 2 things that keep me coming back are 
1.) consistency - the food is always great, they literally never skip a beat.
2.) I'm a clean freak, and let me tell you they keep their restaurant CLEAN."}
{"text":"Herrera's is awesome! Never been disappointed in anything I have eaten there. I love their #20. It's a good choice when you don't want rice and beans. Their beans are really good and their chips! I highly recommend eating here! Way better than any Filibertos!"}
{"text":"I've been there before and the food was okay. I went there last night and ordered the carne asada and shrimp quesadilla. The carne asada was dry and if there were any shrimp you could count them on one finger. The price went through the roof. Also half the quesadilla didn't have any cheese or meat on it. The price went up and the food went down . will not go back"}
{"text":"Good food! Good beans. Chile Reno's were tasty also. Will go back if i'm in the area the water on tap is pretty gross."}
{"text":"The Food is always good and cashiers are super nice.  The place is clean and the  horchata is sweet."}
{"text":"Been to Hereras multiple times, sometimes with a group.  The food is outstanding.  Everyone raved about their meal.  It's fast-food with sit-down restaurant quality."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer to this establishment for over 4 years. Today I was especially impressed with their ability to deliver excellent customer service despite being bombarded with a family of 20 who might I add trashed the whole restaurant with a combination of their kids throwing silverware and throwing food on the ground and rearranging all the tables and chairs just to make themselves comfortable at the expense of all other customers. In light of all this, my friend and I still received our meals in a more than timely manner with the appreciated but not expected \"Have a Wonderful night guys\" as we left despite a the loud, destructive chaos that was occurring as we got our meals. I commend the employees here for the hard work they put into their job and their ability to handle high stress situations despite having a small staff. Oh and might I mention that this high level of customer service was performed at midnight of all times. Highly recommend this restaurant not just for their food but for their customer service as well!"}
{"text":"I live down the street but never been here has the filibertos kind of generic Mexican food place where you think it's going to be nasty . I was surprised I loved the place very clean and friendly staff. The tacos are very good !!"}
{"text":"PROS: Pollo Asado burrito! Yum! I have been coming to this place for years. I have tried a few different items on their menu, the pollo asado burrito is the best! The carne asada burrito is not bad either. The place is clean, servers are friendly and it's open 24/7. Nice condiments area with chips, salsas, pickled carrots and jalapenos. CONS: Sometimes the drive tru can be really slow.  Other food items I had are just mediocre, the wings are terrible."}
{"text":"I got the beef tostadas and my friend got cabeza tacos. They both looked good but were so disgusting! I will never be back"}
{"text":"This is where it's at best place for Mexican food cravings on the go. Fast friendly clean and their burritos are amazing. Always fresh Arizona burrito is Bomm!! Carniasada Fries will blow your mind"}
{"text":"Growing up and spending my most of my life in San Diego, Ca, I became accustomed to fine \"Hole in the wall\" Mexican food. One of my greatest disappointments upon moving to the Valley, was not being able to find the same quality of carne-a-sada burrito, quac, and salsa that I was used to. And then I found Herreras...

Pretty much the only thing I get here (because I'm a creature of habit and it's sooo good) is the Carne-a-sada burrito and a cheese quesadilla w Guac on the inside.  In fact, I've ordered it so often, this combo is now a \"secret\" item on the menu...all you have to do is ask for the \"TN Special\", the ladies there know what it is...it'll run you about $10 plus a drink cost, but it will also fill you up for the rest of the day!

Great service, great food, makes me miss San Diego just a little less..."}
{"text":"Herrera's is literally the best Mexican Food place I have ever been to. I was a vegetarian for two years but I had one bite of their CARNE ASADA FRIES and it was all over. It is so good and delicious, I often end up sharing it with someone because the serving is so huge. I used to live closer to Glendale but live in Tempe now and I still make the drive about once a month to get the carne asada fries. You will NEVER find better fries. 
I have not tried anything but the Carne Asada Fries on the Menu but I have gone with people that have and they always had great reviews."}
{"text":"First time there Monday to take advantage of bean burrito. Service was fast, tacos were delicious, burritos fabulous. Just  one mile from home. Free chips and salsa while your order is being cooked. 
Will definitely return. Every day they have a special price on menu items."}
{"text":"Pretty good food the beans and tortillas always taste fresh. Fairly fast service! Also inexpensive which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Short and simple the staff are nice and friendly, really great food, and the place is always clean. Probably the greatest Mexican restaurant in Peoria."}
{"text":"The food is good. The tacos, burritos. Chimichangas are good. Nice serving size. Always friendly service. Open 24 hours with drive thru service. Only down the block from my house."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this joint!  I've never had bad experience and there food is always on point from the breakfast burritos to the carne asana fries! Me and the fiancé love this place! Awesome customer service and clean! The 24 hour drive thru is a plus as well!"}
{"text":"Ohh yea. Im a sucka for chip and salsas. Yummmm. I kept going back for more chips. Hehe :)  this place is just any other mexican restaurant. But if course I came during lunch time, not after the club after 3am for the munchies. Haha.
THE BEAN and RICE was so tasty.  Idk what and how they cook their rice, but it has some kind of sweet pure taste to it. I don't even care. I like it :))"}
{"text":"Chicken tacos and steak mini tacos AR SO YUMMY. Add the bite of a pickled jalapeño carrot and you have perfection on a plate for a bargain."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are yummy. I like the salsa bar inside, the medium is the best. Friendly service, although you usually wait a bit."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Mexican food restaurant. Inside is open 24hours!!! Servings are pretty big and food is great. Chips and salsa bar is really cool too!"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours. My wife and I have always got good food, and service here.
Herrera's is less than 1/4 mile from our house. 
They have a few tables in the restaurant but most of their business it drive through and take out. 
Their burritos are plenty for one person to eat if you are hungry and enough to share if you are not. 
I enjoy coming here because the food is good, people friendly and this is a locally owned business which I prefer.
Give them a try! You will be back."}
