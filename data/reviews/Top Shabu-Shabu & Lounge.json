{"text":"This hot pot restaurant is one of the most authentic I have ever been to. The soup base had a delicious mix of herbs and vegetables. You could really tell that it had been stewing for a while. My dad is a big hot pot aficionado and as a result, we ordered a myriad of different add-ons. The vegetables and meat were all very fresh. Both my dad and I ordered different flavors of bubble tea and to my surprise they were both delightful. I would even dare say that the teas were on par with The Asian Tea House close by on the Pitt campus.  The restaurant itself was very clean and the staff was extremely polite. The decor was very modern with an obvious Asian flair. It was a bit pricy but very worth the quality of the food. I can't wait to try the Korean bbq next time I come with a larger party. I would highly recommend this establishment especially since it even managed to impress my dad."}
{"text":"Went here upon the recommendation of a friend and had a great experience. My husband and I were able to individualize our choices with different broths.  He went for the spicy, while I stuck with the vegetarian, and we further personalized our broths by visiting the \"sauce bar\" with a wide variety of sauces and herbs. They have a great selection of foods for cooking in the broth; we particularly enjoyed the mushroom selection. The tofu was tasty and a great deal, with a nice plate of tofu coming in at just $2.50.   I'd just throw out a heads-up that the veggie combo platter is a basket of mainly leafy greens. Our waiter mentioned sweet corn as one of the included vegetables, but that was a one inch long block off an ear of corn. Really not a great value compared to the other options you can order individually.   Other than that, it was the perfect \"date night\" choice for us! If you like hot pot/fondue but don't want to spend an arm and a leg at the Melting Pot, check it out!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! I am visiting Pittsburgh and my family took me here. I feel like I could come here everyday!! This restaurant is also my first hotspot restaurant where everyone gets their own soup pot. And this definitely has given me a really great impression! It's all you can eat and everything is fresh! And I was very very impressed and amazed when I saw the sauce bar. You get to make your own sauce and put whatever you want in it which I definitely appreciate since I don't like the already made sauce that the restaurant gives."}
{"text":"This place had a very tasty and authentic hot pot experience! I went with coworkers during lunch and it was a decent deal using the lunch combo at $10 per person. However, place is somewhat on the expensive side at regular price."}
{"text":"Service: good or BTA Food: which is the most important factor of a resturant. Everthing taste average or even worse.  i will not come back again."}
{"text":"?????? ???????? ????? ?????????????? ????????????????????????? ?????????????"}
{"text":"First of all, the sauce bar was non existent. They give you the option of \"hot pot sauce\", burnt chili flakes, salt, and garlic which has no flavor. They only offer cilantro as fresh garnish for sauce, which is lacking as well. Secondly, the service was not good. You mark items down on menu, but the waitress will fail to bring all requested items every time. Usually, we were getting some of our requested items, but we never got appropriate quantities. This forced us to eat less desirable options instead of filling up on more flavorful options. The overall menu options were rather dull. Do not expect a wide array of variety, as you'll be expected to pay $3.99 for imitation crab meat. The total price for the meal of hot pot buffet ran $25, but I did not see the value when compared to places in Cleveland. The broth is not flavorful, and I do not suggest the spicy broth as it will be littered with burnt chili flakes and oil which has no flavor. At the end of the meal, usually you would add vegetable and noodles to the pot to absorb the flavor. Unfortunately, the broth at the end of this meal did not have a good flavor and was simply too oily to be enjoyed at the end of the meal. We came for Korean BBQ, it wasn't enticing, and left after tasting disappoint with hot pot.  Danke."}
{"text":"Can't see why so many guests favor this place. Both the food and the service are terrible. The broth is tasteless as the beef and lamb are far away from being fresh. No waitress offers any water or napkins until I stop one of them and ask."}
{"text":"Beer was room temperature and the meat was pretty nasty.  I spent a few years in Korea and loved these places while I was out there.  This place excited me coming in but disappointed me on the way out.  Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but the service and management here are dishonest and insulting. Went to try this place out with a $20 PG deal voucher. The waiter first tried to tell me that the PG deal was only good on the all-you-can-eat hot pot orders. When I pointed out that the voucher said nothing about that, he reluctantly agreed but the tone of the entire evening went downhill from there. I proceeded to order the hot pot and my daughter chicken fried rice. The waitress arrived with a large plate of fatty beef, simultaneously warning me that I would be charged for wasting food. So I asked her to take half of the plate back as I didn't want to be charged for wasting food, to which she protested that she couldn't take it back because it was already presliced. Hunh? When the bill came, I noticed that only a $10 discount had been applied. The manager refused to honor the $20 discount voucher, arguing that his interpretation of the voucher contract with \"the PG lady\" meant a 50% off hot pot with purchase of $20 or more. Then he demanded that I pay the full amount and call \"the PG lady\"  to seek a refund for my voucher?! When I refused, he shouted, \"Forget it! Don't pay me anything! Just get out but I don't ever want to see you hear ever again!\" I was utterly floored at this point. I paid cash for the full bill, minus $20, and got the hell out of there. I have never, ever been so insulted and humiliated in a restaurant like this before."}
{"text":"3.5  Came here alone so didn't get hotpot. Ordered lamb malatang (???) instead. The portion was HUGE, and it was only $10. Ended up taking some of it home. The dish had a decent amount of meat (although the lamb was a little overcooked), as well as vegetables and vermicelli. The flavor, though, was very bland. Not only was it not spicy, it didn't even have any flavor. The waitress was nice though and allowed me to get some soy sauce from the sauce bar, and that made it a lot better. Seems like a cheap option to get hotpot-style food without paying too much   [Also came here a year ago and got ???? (mala pot?)?much more flavorful and also generous portions]"}
{"text":"I was so excited for a shabu shabu place in Pittsburgh. As others have mentioned this place is not shabu shabu, but it's close enough.  Yes, the sauce bar is confusing, but I asked the guy in front of me for suggestions. He recommended a light sauce and a heavy sauce. Light sauce: soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, cilantro and hot sauce. Heavy sauce: shacha with or without hot peppers, garlic and cilantro. You're welcome.  We did the \"buffet\" for $19.99pp. All you can eat as long as you order it within two hours. Order your soup base, and choose from like, 100 ingredients. All delicious, especially the pumpkin, shrimp balls and dumplings (which cost extra).  Also, they have a full bar.  If I have any nitpicks it's that the bar stools are too short and the liquor selection is not good enough. Also, they should really offer a mixed drinks menu.  But I am super excited to have a real restaurant in Oakland, and very pleased that it's hot pot. We are already talking about coming back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Been here about six times in the last 2 years and the food is fantastic. Ive never been unsatisfied with the selection of noodles, vegetables, and meats to throw in the stock. The quality of service can be hit or miss depending on how crowded it is which is why I did not give five stars. Overall though it's a great little place to eat in Oakland. I travel from the south hills just to come here."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Facebook after they did their soft opening and wanted to give them a try. Decided to go there on a Friday night for dinner with a few friends, party of 3. For a new place and dinner time rush i expected a wait, but waited for about 45 minutes before a table opened up. This is the sort of place that people take their time eating and  after their meal is done sit around to shoot-the-shit with one another. It is nice that they take your name and your number so that you can do whatever business you might have and they'll call you to come back for your table.   The atmosphere was actually pretty nice. It was nicer than I expected, but definitely louder as it's more of a social event/gathering type meal. Lots of conversations buzzing about. I did like the interior design it was more modern with wood accents. The tables are large and spacious so theres enough room for all that you order and you're not on top of one another while eating.   Their menu was very easy to read, broken down by categories like appetizers, meats, veggies, etc... and surprisingly more variety than I expected. Each item is individual yet they do offer combination platters for meats and veggies. I would recommend/suggest to the restaurant on giving the option of what items customers want in the combination plates rather than having a set dish.   I've had shabu shabu in places like Philadelphia and New York, but this is the first time I've ever seen individual hot pots rather than one large family-style meal. Although not very traditional, I think it's pretty clever especially in a city like Pittsburgh where 'family style' meals might not be the 'norm'. Everyone can customize to their own tastes and preferences. I would agree with other yelpers and say that individual dishes does make it more expensive to dine here, even if you share the meats & veggies.  Everything came out at once rather than waves which was nice. Each seat had it's own burner to keep the pot warms and you could control the temperature on a 1-5 scale. The broth of the hot pot was definitely on the bland side in my opinion, but it was made with real ingredients that you could still see in your individual dishes ( garlic, onion, ginger, etc). There is a condiment table towards the center of the restaurant that has a variety of sauces for extra flavoring. I personally did not partake, but imagine the additional sauces would improve the flavor.   We wanted to try the KBBQ, but ended up only getting the pork belly - which was pretty darn good in my opinion. In addition to the individual place burners, there is a larger one in the middle that houses a hot plate grill. When you order the BBQ they'll bring a platter of your meat of choice with onions, garlic, and peppers. The pork also came w/ a sauce and basting brush for grilling. I like that this is a actual grill your own foods rather than kitchen prepped. Fresher and hotter - better to taste. I would definitely come back to try their other meats for BBQ if the pork belly was any indication of their other meats.   The waiters, waitresses, and bus boys were very attentive and gave great customer service. Since it was our first time there we asked a lot of questions and our waitress answered them all and gave us her recommendations. She was very helpful - don't forget to tip the wait staff!   Overall was a decent experience. I didn't expect to get something I would get in other cities with larger Asian populations, but it was pretty decent. I would come back and try a second time so I can get a better feel of their menu. Since they're still pretty new I'm sure they're working out the kinks. We were told that next week they would have their liquor license as well, which I think would improve the experience. Nothing like a nice beer/drink with your bbq or hot pot."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Every time I come here, I am so satisfied time and time again. I keep telling myself to write a Yelp review after each visit, but I kept forgetting. I just went here again on Sunday, so now it is time for my review! On Sunday, we experienced the \"All you can eat hot pot\" special. It's about $24/person and there is a two hour dining period. Everyone in your party chooses their soup base-- either white, spicy, or vegetable. I like the spicy soup base because it has the most flavor, IMO. If you're not a fan of spice, just remove the hot peppers from the soup when it is brought out to you. The soup get spicier over time if you leave the peppers in. Anyways! This place is like the Melting Pot for Asian cuisine. You can choose the veggies and proteins your table would like to eat. Note- 1 order of something feeds about 2-3 people. Most recently, we tried new veggies and proteins we normally wouldn't get a la carte since everything was included. We tried fish balls, the sausage and tripe? Along with our normal lamb, calamari, baby corn, greens, broccoli and udon noodles. If your mouth isn't already watering, they also have a sauce bar in which you can mix and match to create your own unique sauce to eat with your food. I could eat at this place every week if I had the chance to! I highly recommend this hidden gem if you're ever out and about in Oakland!"}
{"text":"Two star is for the food, not the service.  This restaurant was super expensive when it first opened, but then changed to a buffet instead, which is really nice. The food is fresh. The hotpot itself is flavorless but you can get all the spices you need.   NOW ONTO THE FREAKING SERVICE  I HATE dinning here!! Only reason I still go is because this is the only hotpot place near Pitt. Every time I come here I don't feel respected. The waiter and waitress have a habit of serving Americans first. I remember one time vividly when my table needed water, while not one, but two waitresses were at an American's table chatting with them and making sure they are comfortable, as well as teaching them how to eat. This always happens!! There are so many times when the waiter/waitress ask if the Americans' table is ok with everything, and just walks away without checking in on us!! I hate discrimination especially coming from my own race. Other than that, the waiters are also not efficient enough. They are always slow on their task and lost my order once and told me I didn't place it... I had to write on the menu paper so of course I know I placed it! They don't seem to care if you are waiting or not, they do things at their own pace.  All in all, I don't come here anymore after a couple of times. I hate being treated like sh*t by people of my own race.  Edit: There was another time I went there when my parents came for the graduation. They are Chinese and can't speak English very well. Since it's a Chinese restaurant, my dad was trying to see if they have the Chinese beer he likes. The waiter had such a nasty attitude. They should not treat people like this. I'm pretty sure these Asian Americans have families speaking broken English. They should've been more understanding. Not to mention you shouldn't be rude to your customers in the first place."}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant. I absolutely loved it. The all you can eat is amazing and priced great for what you get. There are so many options to choose from on the list. The food was fresh and tasty. The service was great. Our server was very attentive and anytime we ordered more off the menu it made its way to the table very quickly.  We were lucky enough to chat with the owner which made the experience even better. As it was our first time at hot pot he made some great recommendations. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I have dined here three times now and it keeps getting better and better as I figure out my own strategy for eating hot pot. My first time here, I wasn't sure what to expect because I wasn't all too familiar with hot pot. We had an extremely helpful waiter who patiently described his favorite ingredients and his own technique for eating hot pot. I ordered the hot and spicy broth while my husband ordered the white soup base. The hot and spicy broth is essentially the white broth with chili oil and chili peppers. The soup bases consist of many aromatics such as ginger, goji berries, dates, whole garlic cloves and things of that nature, making the broth very well-rounded in flavor. I'm nearly positive these aromatics aren't meant to be consumed but don't quote me. After three visits, I prefer ordering the white soup base and adding my own chili from the sauce bar so that I can control the spice level. The sauce bar has a lot of additions you can add to your soup, such as duck sauce, soy sauce, cilantro, scallions, sugar vinegar...the sauce bar is quite extensive.   So the concept is you order a soup base and there's a table side burner that boils or keeps your soup warm. And the ingredients you order come out raw and you cook them as your soup is burning away over the burner, similarly to fondue.  What I like to do is order at least one item from each category of ingredients (protein, greens, noodles, etc). My favorites to order are chrysanthemum greens, fatty beef, beef balls (meatballs), luncheon meat (basically spam), enoki mushrooms, fish tofu, dumplings and I either like glass noodles or udon noodles. The trick is to place in the items that take the longest to cook first, but if you're impatient like me, piling everything into the broth all at once and bringing it back up to a boil seems to work just fine for me! You'll find that at the end of the meal, your broth will be delicious as ever from all the different flavors that you cooked in it.   I love this place because the staff is very friendly, the food is amazing, there isn't anything like it in Pittsburgh, it's clean and inviting, and did I say the food is great? The only thing is it can get expensive when you're ordering a la carte ingredients, but I highly recommend going for their lunch special if you're looking to score a deal on Chinese hot pot!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went here because we accidentally mixed up when Oakland $6 restaurant week is. We had all intended to get one of the $6 specials, but when we learned we were wrong about the date, we all went for the lunch hot pot special. It's $9.99 and you get to pick soup base, meat, meatballs, and noodles. It comes with enoki mushrooms and napa cabbage.  None of us had ever been to a hot pot place before, so it was interesting. I was not used to the long chop sticks and had trouble with them when having to reach for things across my pot. It seemed a little messy, but a lot of fun. I loved the sauce bar and that you could mix up different flavors for your bowl. Everything tasted great and it was a fun, longer than normal lunch break.  I definitely want to go back so I can try more of the ingredients and am really excited because they have an all you can eat special, so definitely want to go back with my boyfriend."}
{"text":"First time here and they just started a AYCE Shabu which is what I did.  You fill out everything on a piece of paper with how many portions you'd like. There is no limit, but they could charge you if you leave left overs.   There's also a sauce bar with plenty of options to choose from and you create your own! Everything was good, but just sad that the sauces were not spicy.  I like the idea how you can eat hot pot and BBQ! The small openings on the table to accommodate the hot pot is a genius idea."}
{"text":"Great place for groups! Tons of options for meat lovers vegetarians or pescatarians. We went for lunch and had a choice of a base soup, meats or tofu, and so on. Also came with Napa cabbage and etoki mushroom. Tofu wasn't initially an option but we asked the waitress and she said she could include it. Love how flexible that was and how it worked out for everyone."}
{"text":"Went on a date with my hubs and for the longest time I've wanted to come here. However, at the time I had no idea how to eat hotpot so I promised myself I should just give it a go!  I don't think I need to to explain the process because my fellow Yelpers did a wonderful job at that. So I'll talk about my experience and what I ordered.  What was exceptional is the service. EVERYONE is so nice! The host even gave us a laminated card explaining how long each food item will cook for. He even took the time to explain to us how he and other customers prefer to cook their food. Over time he said you'll learn what style of hotpot eater you are.   For me, I am a dumper. I don't cook and eat as I go. I dump. And then when it's done I eat. My husband puts what add-ins he wants at the time cooks and eats. He is very neat whereas I like to get into it. Overall the experience is fun and a great way to enjoy conversation and company with friends and family.  My favorite items (in random order):  white base soup, lamb, fried tofu skin, sponge tofu, shrimp and fish balls, all the mushrooms, fatty beef, daikon radish, ramen noodles.  Items I want to try:  bean curd sticks, lunch meat (I'm guess it's spam), chrysanthemum greens, potato, winter melon, fried fish cake, fried tofu, hot pot dumplings, and scallion pancake  Lastly, the sauces. If u have the right sauce your experience will be that much better. I like to add sesame paste, shacha, minced garlic, cilantro, soy sauce, and vinegar.  I saw other condiments like MSG but passed. I know that's the secret ingredient in most Asian cooking. My grandma swore by it and used to put it in everything.  Anyways, I definitely recommend trying out their hot pot. For $19.99 AYCE, it's a steal!"}
{"text":"One of the only shabu shabu places around this area but for someone who can't eat GINORMOUS amounts, this place is way too overpriced for me. I spent almost $30 on my last dinner here. Dinner has ACYE hot pot which is $19.99 per person. But the thing is even if we ordered al carte, it'd still be around that price to order a meat and some vegetables. Maybe it's because I came from California that I think this is too pricey. I liked the tempura. I didn't really like the choices of sauces since they seemed very bland and simple compared to the other shabu shabu places I've been to. If you don't mind high prices, feel free to visit but I don't think I'm coming again."}
{"text":"The food was great and the hot pot was such a fun experience! The prices were very reasonable especially considering all the food we got. I would highly recommend Top Shabu-Shabu!"}
{"text":"No idea why this place is called Top Shabu-Shabu because its not shabu shabu. Its Mongolian hot pot, but I guess since shabu shabu is pretty trendy right now, cash out on the name right?  Anyways, this place reminds me a lot of the popular Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot restaurants. You get a sheet of paper where you mark down yourself what type of meats and veggies you want along with the soup base. The plates are pretty small so the dishes add up pretty quickly. But everything was pretty good and honestly, its damn near impossible to mess up on hot pot.  One thing that is sorta cool here is that there's a sauce bar where you can customize it to your taste. My biggest gripe with the sauce bar though is that there's no instructions on how to make the sauce so if you've never had it, there's a lot of testing and going back and forth to do.  Having some beer with the hot pot is pretty crucial because of the balancing of the hot and cold Chinese old wive's tale stuff and the price for a pitcher of beer is pretty reasonable. They even have yogurt soju here which is a plus."}
{"text":"Probably the biggest highlight for me is the sauce bar, they have a great variety. It doesn't blow my mind but it is one of the only places to find legitimate hot pot in the area. They do have some of the more \"exotic\" ingredients, but the prices can add up."}
{"text":"First...TOO expensive! I cannot believe how much money I spent!! I was full, but not happy about it.   So to start, we got one \"set\" of menus for the entire table of 6. Weird. There are three menus. There is an all-you-can-eat menu, an entree menu, and a plastic menu. I'm not sure of the difference between the plastic one and the entree other than the plastic one had more reasonably priced items (still too high). The all-you-can-eat is where they bring food to the table and you cook it in a hot pot on a burner built into the table.  The staff came over several times asking if we knew what we wanted. Well, with only one set of menus, it was hard to know that quickly. We asked for additional menus. The server looked as us oddly, but we did get them.  We chose to go with the all-you-can-eat and we all selected our items. Price for this...not on the menu. Interesting....and actually, really WRONG. Not until our food arrived did we find out it was $24.99 PER PERSON! WHAT???? REALLY?? AND..we only found that out because it was written on our menu that we \"turned in\". Not because anyone told us. I think I ate about $12 worth of food. We were also not instructed on how to use the burner and at one point some of pots boiled over and onto our feet below the table. (Oh, we had to pay extra for fried tofu!!)  I had some left in my little soup pot, but was not allowed to take it home. Reason: It was an all-you-can-eat. Really??? Now I paid $24.99 for food I literally had to cook and I can't take home my leftovers. I totally get that when you go to a buffet that is cheap. This was not a buffet nor cheap! And actually, not that good to fight about it!  OK...so...I have to WRITE down my own order. I have to cook my own food. And I also have to pay $24.99 PER PERSON.  Was the food good? Well...it was very average. Was it worth $25. Absolutely not. It also took way too long. We were there for over 2 hours trying to decide and then to cook our own food. We also had to go to the sauce bar ourselves to pick non-descriptive sauces. Do you put them in the pot? On the food? How does all of this work?   THEN.....After I wrote my own order, I cooked my own food, I retrieved my own utensils and sauces...Because we had 6 people at our table a 20% gratuity was added to the bill. You have GOT to be kidding me???!!! What did the server do? Brought plates of frozen food for us to cook and refilled water.   This was one of the biggest mistakes we've made regarding restaurant choice. It is in the heart of Oakland (a college community). Not sure this high price point will survive. The atmosphere was kind of interesting, until the football game (not a Pittsburgh game) was blaring through the television.  If you have managed to read through this entire review, trust me, do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"A bit pricier compared to other options in a college area but the food is good and unique. Come during certain times of the week for special deals concerning the hot pots for a satisfying experience for your tastebuds and wallet. Basically the hot pots are delicious with more options. Korean BBQ I wish there was more meat but the quality is pretty good. Appetizer choices are delicious. Do not order take out though unless you get fried rice or appetizers."}
{"text":"What a great find! I was surprised when a friend who recently moved back to town told me about this place, we had enjoyed a few different option when visiting him in the Bay Area. I'd been wanting shabu for a while and thought I was just out of luck here in the burgh. The staff is very attentive and super friendly too. It's totally kid friendly (one of the servers was helping some younger kids get lollipops by carrying them around). The kids love cooking their own food. Lots of options with noodles, vegetables, dumplings etc. The broths were delicious, the vegetables were fresh and the beef fresh sliced. I've seen reviews complaining about the meat being frozen when it comes to the table, but it has to be frozen in order to slice it that thin to order. We chose the all you can eat option and we're able to sample lots of options and fill our bellies. Overall one of my new favorite places...and my kids too. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I came here with my parents for dinner, and was pleasantly surprised at the food and the service, my mom and I got the white base and my dad got the spicy base, all of the add ons were fantastic, the bases were perfectly seasoned and my dad said that the spicy base was quite spicy. It was fun putting all of the meat, vegetables noodles, etc. into the broth and watching it cook very quickly, there were plenty of great options to choose from. The servers were very nice and attentive and helped out whenever they could. Overall I was very satisfied with the food and the service."}
{"text":"It is a nice place for how cheap it is. $20(somewhere around this price) all you can eat hot pot. The taste is good. You can choose from two different bases which is basically depends on wether you like spicy or not. The pot is individually served and all the other ingredients are on small plates for you to put them in your pot when the pot starts to boiling. I wish they would expand their dipping sauce options since there are so many different dipping sauces. I've heard they also have Korean BBQ as well. Maybe we will try that next time."}
{"text":"We visited this past Saturday night, so the 45 minute wait was expected. The hostess was very sweet and apologetic, which was very appreciated. You could tell that they wanted to keep people around.  Now the food, my boyfriend and I ordered hot pot and the beef short ribs. The best part is that they offer different flavors of broth. The spicy one was very good. Everything, meats, vegetables, and additions to the hot pot, are sold a la carte, which I like since the combos typically come with items I wouldn't eat. The portions are large considering the price, especially for the vegetables. The sauce bar is pretty extensive and makes for a very delicious addition for dipping your meats. The korean bbq was delicious as well. They give you the marinade separately to brush onto the meat, which was very nice.  The server seemed very friendly, but there seems to be a lack of communication between servers. One person took our order, not our server, but I think there was some confusion as to what we ordered. However, they did work to fix things very quickly.   Oh and we did get steamed dumplings, egg pancake, and some lamb skewers as appetizers. Just an fyi, everything will come out almost at the exact same time, regardless whether they are appetizers or not, which is fine by me. The only thing that was sad was that the dumplings and egg pancake did not come with their own sauces, as other restaurants have. But they are very reasonably priced, so I can't complain too much. I'll definitely be back, but most for the korean bbq and not on a weekend evening rush."}
{"text":"CM and I visited Top Shabu-Shabu with a couple of other friends tonight for dinner before heading to Phipps for a double date.  They had originally suggested the Porch, but since I've been there about a million times, I suggested that we try somewhere new and different.  Neither I nor our friends had ever had the chance to try hot pot before, so we were excited to check it out.  Upon our arrival, our waiter asked if we were familiar with hot pot, and we told him we weren't, so he gave us a quick briefing on how it works.  He also gave us some helpful recommendations concerning ingredients under each category.  If you're unfamiliar, the way hot pot works is that you choose a broth base to start, and then you choose from ingredients in several categories, including meat, seafood, veggies, and other add ins to add to your soup base.  You then add any condiments you wish to add, and then cook your ingredients in the soup base and eat it.  For our broth base, CM and I chose the white broth.  For our add ins, we chose chicken gizzards, cuttlefish, napa cabbage, seaweed knots, hot pot dumplings, glass noodles, and thick noodles.  Our friends chose the fatty beef, fish cakes, sausage, sweet corn, and two orders of glass noodles.  Because we had such a wide selection of add ins, we were able to mix and match and share quite easily.  Additionally, we raided the condiment bar and tried several of the condiments, including shacha, sesame oil, vinegar, hot sauce, soy sauce, cilantro, and scallions.  (There was even powdered MSG--we passed on that, though!)  Despite being newbies to hot pot, we were very pleased with the outcome of our creations, in general.  The broth had a nice flavor in and of itself, but the add ins made it great, and the condiments enhanced the flavor even more.  I enjoyed most of the add ins, with the notable exception of the chicken gizzard, which I found too chewy (though I suspect I may have undercooked it).  My friends also generally enjoyed theirs, and particularly liked the fish cakes, but weren't as keen on the sausage.  The meal was surprisingly filling, such that all of us felt stuffed by the time we left.  CM, the only one of us who'd had hot pot before, said that it seemed pretty authentic, and I agree.  The rest of the clientele certainly indicated that this was the case, given that we were the only table with no East Asians!  In addition to the hot pot, I tried the Oasis drink, which consisted of blue curacao liquor and lychee.  Though I definitely could taste the lychee well, the drink was quite sweet and not as complex as I'd like, but for $5, I can't complain!  In terms of ambiance, this place leans towards in the trendy/clubbish direction.  At the time of our visit (6pm on Fri.), the restaurant was only half full (if that), but I'm guessing this is due to most of the undergraduate students being gone for the summer.  (I suggest taking advantage while you can!)  The check for CM and I came to $43, which was slightly less than I expected.  Overall, we were all very pleased with our experience here, and would definitely return for another hot pot or to try the Korean BBQ.  If you visit, I strongly suggest coming with a group so that you can share add ins, as we did, and try a variety of different combinations for your hot pot."}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up in Pittsburgh! Perfect stop on a winter's day! They have an all you can eat hot pot buffet for $20 or a lunch special for $10. I got the lunch special with a friend and we both got the spicy broth. It was well flavored and there was definitely more than enough food for both of us. The sauce bar also has a decent selection. I only wish they had peanut sauce and spicy sesame sauce, but it didn't hinder my experience.   The staff was sooo nice and had a very friendly demeanor. The food came out fast and the area isn't too large or crowded so it gives a more home-y atmosphere. There are always servers available to assist you.   Overall, I can't say anything really bad about it and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"$23 for AYCE hot pot. I wish they had prices on their online menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just went there tonight for my birthday, and WOW. First off all, we were seated right away, and our host was very sweet. She asked us right away what we wanted, and told us the price. (We got the all you can eat hotpot). Then, our server walked us through everything, and as soon as our food came told us exactly what to do, and how long to cook our food for. The AYCE price is 24.99 but honestly, with the wide selections and amount of food you can get, I believe it's worth it. Our server also showed us tricks on how to make a good sauce, and was super attentive to us. What a cool place to go, definitely will be back."}
{"text":"II was excited to try this place after falling in love with Hot Pot in Boston. I was so dissapointed. First off, their prices are exorberant for the Hot Pot experience in comparison to the quality and price point in other cities. Not a great value. In addition, a member dining with me got the beef noodle soup. The beef was so chewy it was inedible and the broth had no flavor. Even trying to add some of their sauce mix ins didn't make it better. If that wasn't bad enough, there was only one waitress/hostess during dinner. This meant long waits for simple things such as a drink refill. When the waitress asked how things were, I politely mentioned the issues with my entree. Her response was more sauce. When that didn't do the trick, she packed up the leftovers and said take home. In other words, I don't think her English was very good to understand the issue. Great concept, poor, overpriced execution. FYI. 2 hour limit for Hot Pot Buffet. This wouldn't be an issue if service was prompt. I do not plan on dining here again."}
{"text":"Since I'm a big shabu shabu/hotpot fan, I was really excited to try this place; however, it's just meh. One order of fish/seafood tofu is just 2 pieces of it that are sliced into twos (so \"4\" pieces total) - basically, each order consists of too little (it would cost only a few cents retail to give an extra slice or piece!). They also have bbq but the meat quality is not good...I don't think I'll be coming here again. It's overpriced, and the quality and quantity is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Went there for the 20 dollar all-you-can-eat hotpot dinner, the only regret I had was eating way too much. Both the spicy and non-spicy soup/broths were good. Beef was sliced thin and did not have the just-came-out-of-the-freezer look. Portions of individual plates were small but this being a buffet-style hotpot, it enables you to try more things. The place was packed but we were willing to sit at the bar so the wait was not too terrible. Speaking of bars, the sauce bar was definitely a plus. Although some items here could've used a replenishment from time to time to keep up w/ the demand."}
{"text":"My friends and I had such a fun experience here last weekend! We did the all you can eat option because it allows you to try anything you want.  Some of the items we picked from the menu included: Lamb, Fatty Beef, Shrimp (head on), Shrimp Balls, Fish Tofu, Napa cabbage, A-Choy, Daikon, Sweet Corn, Broccoli, Udon Noodles, Glass Noodles, Soft Tofu, Frozen Tofu, Oyster Mushrooms, with the white soup base.   I really liked the Lamb and Daikon with my sauce creation! Our waitress was really good about asking us if we wanted \"refills\" on our dishes and even recommended us to try the fatty beef which was really good! Some of these things I probably would have never of tried if my friend Theresa did not come along. It was nice to experience new foods! Next time I would like to do the Korean bbq. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to branch out and try new things."}
{"text":"was pleasantly surprised that it's a relatively authentic hotpot place.  apparently they have 2 options that people haven't really mentioned. 1. individual hotpot per person at $7 (this is a nontraditional method) 2. they have a table they can put out a big hotpot for sharing (2 broths) for $20  they have a large selection of meats, seafood and veggies to pick from. service was good when I was there. the quality was much better than i expected and i was very satisfied with the overall experience!"}
{"text":"I went to this place on Friday around 5:30 p.m.. We went early because we've heard that the waiting time was long but I guess since it's summer and there aren't many people that we didn't have to wait. It was two of us going for hot pot. Our waiter was really friendly and nice. She explained to us the concept of hot pot and gave us the menu which we had to mark what we wanted. We ended up getting the white soup base which was delicious! We ordered a seafood platter, veggie platter, meat balls, beef tendon, hot pot dumplings and fried tofu. There was a sauce bar which you could mix anything that you wanted. We tried the sesame, soy sauce, cilantro and green onions. It was so good! The food and hot pot came fast. We sat there for a while and enjoyed it.   The only reason I'm giving this restaurant four stars instead of five it's due to the pricing. Its quite expensive based on the portions that you get. Portions are pretty small. Our whole meal came out to about $70. We also did not like the beef tendon. It was sliced so thin and the color did not look right. However, this is as best as you can get in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner for the all you can eat with friends, and the food was super good. Everything tasted super fresh and was a great deals. Our server was friendly and prompt. I also appreciated the sauce bar but would have liked a broader range of hot sauces. We were stuffed to the brim by the end and very satisfied. So much food!"}
{"text":"Love the AYCE hot pot here for $20.  The menu is pared down for the AYCE option, but all of the essentials are there (weird though that they don't offer the ubiquitous baby bok choy).  They lost my reservation for a party of 5 on a Saturday night (perhaps due to their very sophisticated handwritten spiral notebook system) but were able to seat us in the very busy space in a reasonable amount of time.  The white soup base was very flavorful, but the spicy version was just the same base with a layer of chili oil and dried chilis tossed on top.  The sauce bar had the basics, but I wished they had more options for adding spice besides just chili oil--perhaps some dried chili flakes or or chili garlic sauce or even Sriracha.  Besides that and the short staffing, I have no further complaints.  I'm addicted to the AYCE hot pot option at Hunan Bar, but this place is a great alternative--$3 cheaper and a very different \"loungey\" rather than divey-Chinese vibe and an ordering system that creates far less waste.  I'm sure I'll be back, wth my own private hot sauce options smuggled in my purse next time."}
{"text":"Overall, I had an average experience here. I think the food was decent, but it was nothing special and definitely not as good as other hot pot places I've been to.  I came with three friends for lunch, and we were told we all had to get the same type of order. There was an all-you-can-eat option, combo option, and customized option. We all decided to order combos. Everyone got their own pot as well as a plate of noodles, veggies, and balls and a plate of meat. I ordered lamb meat, fresh thick noodles, and cuttlefish balls.   While we were waiting, we were told to visit the sauce bar and make our own sauces. It consisted of standard sauces like hot sauce, sesame paste, and hoisin sauce. There was also cilantro, salt, sugar, sesame oil, and others to adjust the flavor. The person serving was quite attentive since we were pretty much the only customers there at the time. We were served in good time and didn't have to wait very long.  In general, everything went okay. The food wasn't particularly spectacular, but if I were really craving hot pot and didn't find a better hot pot place in the area then I might visit again."}
{"text":"As a native to Philadelphia where there is quite a large Asian population and an even larger selection of Asian restaurants, including several hot pot/shabu restaurants in the heart of the city, I thought that Top Shabu Shabu was mediocre at best.    I am accustomed to ordering by combination platter (meat+seafood+vegetables that you could order and split by how many people were in your group) from restaurants back at home; but at, Top Shabu Shabu each item (i.e. meatballs, mushrooms, watercress) are ordered individually. In addition, unlike other hot pot places I've eaten at, each person had their own pot rather one large pot being shared among the group. I guess this is good for people who have different tastes, but I think it makes it much more expensive per person. I ordered a spicy broth (broth alone is $6.95 a person, comes with glass noodles, two pieces of fried tofu, a raw egg, some cabbage, two knots of of seaweed, and some enokitake) with beef tendon balls (about 6 if I remember correctly, $3.99), beef tendon (frozen, cut like chips, $4.99), and hot pot dumplings (about 6, small, $3.99).   The broth itself was made fresh from actual spices rather than being from a can, which is nice, but was bland on its own in my opinion; I added a TON of garlic, green onions, sacha sauce, and this other savory red sauce, and only after then did I think it was really delicious. The dishes I ordered weren't anything particularly special, just your typical hot pot ingredients that you could get from any Asian supermarket in the frozen section.   The food was just enough for me, but I also have the smallest appetite known to man, so what I ordered would probably not be enough for the average person. I also think that I was full mostly from drinking the broth and drinking a lot of water (which I do at any restaurant I go to). Overall, and in my opinion, although the broth ended up being very tasty after I added a bunch of the condiments to it, it wasn't worth the price. My bill ended up coming to ~$17 (after the 20% off deal, would be ~$20 without) not including tip, which is pretty expensive for any average (not fancy) one-person meal. At home, I could share a combination platter among a party of 4-6 for $10-15 a person and a much wider variety of food."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of lunch special here. For only $10, you get pretty much the full hot pot experience. Two types of meat (one of which is a meatball), a fair amount of noodles, and a lot of vegetables. It's not AYCE, but I was plenty full after eating this meal. In terms of the meat, the lamb was super flavorful and very thinly sliced. The broth was very rich and tasty, and it was great how they brought it out at a good temperature for drinking while simultaneously waiting for it to boil.   Having the option of making your own dipping sauce is a huge plus as well, and it's best to go light on each thing you want and gradually increase the flavor as you taste test it. Service was probably above average in this place compared to the typical Chinese restaurant, so that was a plus as well."}
{"text":"This is authentic hot pot, which is a good sign. The soup base is well prepared, and the sauces are very nice too. Meat was of good quality, and the veggies were also very fresh. The environment was very clean, which frankly isn't expected of most Asian restaurants, especially since hot pot gets messy easily.  I only have one complaint, but a big one (I would have gave them a 5 easily if not for this): The price is ridiculous. It averages down to about $40/person. This is good hot pot, but still very overpriced, especially for Pittsburgh. I mean, I know a lot of good hot pot places in New York that are cheaper than this. Many of the customers were Asian students, which sort of bewildered me. How do they afford this on a regular basis?"}
{"text":"I've had really good meals here consistently the hot pot is the best value especially during lunch. The service is pretty good and they are accommodating."}
{"text":"I like the combo offered during weekdays. Cheap, lots of choices and I like the taste of it. Gonna be the designated place for lunch, lol"}
{"text":"We wanted to give this place a try given the delicious looking pictures other Yelpers posted. First of all, the all you can eat hotpot went from $19.99 to $23.99 for two hours. We looked at the menu on the ingredient options that come with all you can eat price, there weren't much to pick from. For example if you want to get fried tofu skin in your shabu shabu, one of the stables for hotpot, you have to pay an extra $3.99 just to get that. Most of your typical hotpot ingredients are all extra on top of the $23.99 price. We decided to just order regular noodles and rice cake dishes right off the menu, flavors were lacking. The service was slow and servers weren't attentive. They weren't busy when we got there and we waited close to an hour to finally get our food after we ordered. The other thing is their menu was really confusing, we have to ask the server several questions to figure out what was in the  dish. Being the only shabu shabu place in Pittsburgh, it certainly did not make an impression for a second visit."}
{"text":"Having had hot pot in China and California (Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot), we went to top shabu shabu with high expectations and they didn't disappoint. We had the all you can eat hot pot, which was very good value for the $22.99 you pay per person. Enjoyed the huge selection of meats (lamb, fish, shrimp with head, beef) and vegetables (not to mention huge variety of mushrooms) that we could order. Everything tasted fresh. Wife went with spicy soup base. I went with vegetable soup base. Both were delicious. Enjoyed the sauces for dipping the cooked meats. Service (Lianne) was excellent."}
{"text":"Well this place opened well after I graduated, but I got to have a taste of it when I went back to visit. It was awesome.  I live in southern California now, where there's an abundance of Asian food. However, even compared to ones here, I'd still say this place is pretty top notch. Also it's CHEAP... Shame, I would've been going to this place every other day had it been open when I was going to Pitt."}
{"text":"Been here previous year when I visit from N.C. and unfortunately the service here and quality has extremely dropped. The people seems to care more about what's on their phone rather then the paying customers. Their prices increased where their quality decreased. It's unfortunate how awesome this place used to be."}
{"text":"Great hot pot. Really the only one that I know of in the Pittsburgh area.  Lots of fun with frinds. Great choices on items to add to your broth.  Good quality in their meats and vegetables.  Service can be a little slow due to how busy they can get.  But if you want to try something different with  a group of friend then i recomend trying hot pot."}
{"text":"Shabu shabu is a nice and cozy place to eat a mid-tier hot pot. The staff is great, knowledgeable, and sure to take care of you well.   For the food, the drink menu is surprisingly diverse, containing standard Chinese drinks likes suanmeitang (sour prune drink). The hot pot is good, although the soup for the spicy base could have more flavor, and portions for the dishes are plentiful. Oh yeah, the dishes are all-you-can-eat as well, which makes for an interesting and bountiful eating experience. The sauce bar is decent, although a bit limited. They have the basics, like sesame paste, hot chili, salt, etc. but I feel like there could be other sauce options that aren't just salty and spicy.  Your hot pot temperature is controlled by yourself, and the experience is just great. You get the cook your own food and eat it exactly how you like it. Overall, definitely impressed by the restaurant, and would be happy to come back for another run at hot pot soon."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review this place for a while now, but I've been putting it off because of laziness.   This has quickly become my favorite restaurant in Oakland. It's one of the few places I actually go back for, now that I've graduated and moved out of the Oakland area.   This is one of the best asian places in Pittsburgh. The hotpot they offer is super traditional, super authentic, and super yummy. Basically, how it works is you sit down, and order a personal soup pot of broth. It's almost like foundue, for people that have never had hot pot before. You order a bunch of raw foods, and you flash cook it in the broth! It's asian comfort food for the soul at it's finest.  I personally always get the white soup base, but my friends love the spicy soup base. The soup base contains asian herbs, and ginger. It's supposed to be really good for your health--I definitely remember my mom making herbal soup similar to this in the winter. Eat the little floaty jogi berries at your own risk!! They can be very bitter. Some definite winners on the menu: fish egg fish balls, chrysanthemum greens, quail eggs, pig's blood (for the more adventurous, it's almost like very firm tofu), glass noodles, and lamb meat.   I always eat family style with my friends, and I would definitely recommend doing that here. That way, everyone can sample everything, and you get to try way more dishes and eat way more food. There's also less confusion with ordering.   The restaurant also has a sauce bar, where you can mix your own to your liking. The place is really clean, and the employees are super nice. They never fail to make you feel like family."}
{"text":"This is a great all-you-can-eat hot pot restaurant with many fresh vegetable, sea food and meat options. You choose a broth, which is heated at the table, and then add your ingredients to the broth, where they cook. Be warned, some of the servings are large, so bring your appetite. There are lots of sauces and additives available too. It's fun with friends and costs $23.99."}
{"text":"I'm so so behind writing this review and as I write it I'm just thinking about how much I want to go back. I went here a few months back with 2 friends after one of them stumbled across this place on yelp. I would basically describe it as a japanese version of the melting pot. They have a little sauce bar where you can mix spices, oils, and sauces together to make your own sauce.   We all decided to go with the unlimited option and ordered a decent amount of options the first round. Not only was everything delicious but it was also really fun and really affordable. I think we all wished we could have fit more in our stomachs. Another huge plus was the waitress who was very friendly and helped explain everything to us. In a situation like that where you are cooking raw foods you definitely don't want someone who doesn't guide you in the right direction.  I would say this place is definitely worth checking out. I feel like everyone should experience hot pot at some point in there life. And if you are one of my friends please take me with you if you decide to go because I'm dying to go back :)"}
{"text":"I'm so excited there's a shabu shabu place in town and only a block from my office!  Some friends and I went for dinner and we shared a bunch of items.  Unlike other places I've been, they do individual mini hot pots at your seat but all the toppings come in a large enough size that you can share with a few people to get more variety and have the communal dining experience.  They also have an awesome dipping sauce bar where you can get as many dipping sauces as you like and mix different combinations.  As for their hot pot ingredients, there are a wide range of veggie, fish and meat options, including more exotic things like pigeon intestines (I did not select that).  We had a few veggie, fish and meat options and everything seemed of good quality and a decent price for what you get.  The service was also very prompt and friendly and they were happy to explain how things worked.  I also liked that all the tables had a bbq setup in the middle where you can cook your own korean style bbq.  I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I won't give you all the run down of how the place works because other reviewers have already covered that. I won't tell you about the sauce bar because my fellow Yelpers have covered that extensively. We're serious about sauces in these parts.   I'm here to tell you all about the exotic meat selection they had going on. I've never felt so adventurous in my life as my friend and I poured over the menu looking for things we weren't familiar with and during to consume them. We ended up with beef tendon balls, seafood balls, fatty beef, lamb, ~baby corn~, various veggies I've never heard of before, an overflowing basket of cabbage, noodles for days, and utterly delicious fish tofu.   After getting over the initial shock of burning my tongue everytime I attempted to pull something from the boiling hot soup and put it in my mouth, I fell in love. The spicy soup base is delicious in and of itself, but with all of the yummy things added (favorites being the lamb and seafood wonton sort of things) the depth of flavor in the broth kept getting better and better.   I soooooooooo wish there was a way to be able to get the hotpot to go, so I can sit around in my undies and nosh on great soup while binge watching something on Netflix, but trust when I say this place is worth putting on a pair of pants for."}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss even if you walk around Oakland frequently like I did. It's tucked away on Atwood and is quite large once you walk inside. Considering the surrounding restaurants are mostly fast food/take out places, this is a cool change in pace. I have only had Shabu-shabu style food a handful of times but this was my first. I am pescatarian so I stuck with fish and veggies in my hot pot. Overall, there is a good variety of sauces and meats to choose from and the novelty of a shabu place is always fun. Each person gets their own hot pot which is nice (good for meat eaters vs non). However, it is fairly pricey especially since this is a college neighborhood (our meals ended up ~$30 per person)."}
{"text":"The place was filled with Asians--which is a VERY good sign.   There aren't many hot pot places in Pittsburgh, so Top Shabu-Shabu is VERY welcome to Pitt! The soft opening drew in a huge crowd, and it may have been overwhelming for the restaurant. It was a hectic day.  DECOR The interior is very nicely decorated with pretty lighting. I can appreciate when a place doesn't have cheap Asian decorations. It's not that large inside, so it feels pretty intimate. Although it looked like they could've used a bigger place because of all the people who showed up the first day. The chairs are comfortable for the 2 hours you might be there enjoying/cooking your food/company. The way the tables work with the inlaid stoves/hot plates means that they're fixed, so the largest party they can accommodate at one table is 8. It's best to come as a party of 2; it has the least wait-time during the peak hours.  FOOD The menu looks like a dim sum menu; I can't describe it any other way. The organization was easy to follow (broth, meats, seafood, veggies, etc.). I ordered the hot and spicy broth with fresh fish and lotus root add-ins. My whole party's broth and add-ins came out quickly after ordering. Each broth comes with a sampler plate of napa cabbage, glass noodles, and an egg. (I LOVE EGGS). They had a sauce counter near the middle of the restaurant, so we gathered about 10 or so sauce bowls at our table to share and try. Overall I really liked the food. The broth was authentic (i.e. not powder-based) with spices and full of flavor.  P.S. Also I'd want to note that I liked the chopsticks-- too often restaurants have low quality chopsticks, and if I can't pick up my food easily because the chopsticks are flimsy or too square, that would negatively affect my experience.  I'd definitely come back again, with friends."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ. I don't recommend these type of places to anyone who likes real food and service. Cooking your own water based stew and boiling meat is just so gross. Really nice people, but this concept is beyond me."}
{"text":"I ordered lamb chops and beef short ribs for Korean bbq as well as hot pot.  Everything was great.  The staff was very attentive and pleasant.  I will definitely be coming back again soon.  Everything was fresh and high quality.  This is a great place to go to with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant once so far, and I was quite impressed. I had a hot pot with the spicy broth and several add-ins. The broth is certainly unlike anything else I've had in Pittsburgh; it had cloves of garlic, hunks of ginger, and plenty of other flavor-imparting ingredients swirling around inside of it that you aren't really meant to eat directly. I guess that I assumed hot pot would be more or less the same as overpriced soup (once you've added your ingredients, anyway), but was pleasantly surprised by how different the experience was."}
{"text":"Horrible. Awful.  Food is the worst hotpot food I have ever had. The sauces are awful. Not authentic hot pot sauces at all. The soup base is not a good flavor at all.  Now there is more.  We called at 8:00 pm and they confirmed they close at 11 pm, and so I told them we would be there 10:10 pm. I asked if this was fine and he said yes. He said it would be too late to have the all-you-can-eat hotpot at that time, but hotspot off the menu was fine, and I said that was fine.   We arrived at 10:05 pm. We were seated and they rushed us to order and we did. Before our food came out, they brought us the check and said please pay first we need to close the registers. It was only 10:10 pm. The bill for 2 of us was $49.60. So I took out $60 and laid it on the tray. The lady comes by and says 'no change needed'. I said I will tip when I am done eating. I haven't even started. She said ok sorry. So actually I just decided to make things easy and I said keep the change when I saw her walk around again in a minute. Now the food comes out about 5 minutes later. We are all paid including 20% tip before any service. So we start eating and before we even finish halfway, they have turned off the A/C as my wife and I are noticeably sweating and our clothes are soaked in sweat. So we don't even bother to finish and we just leave. It is not even 10:45 pm when we leave. We will not go back, and I definitely give a big thumbs down for the food and the service.  Yes and the sauce bar is awful, and the spicy broth is littered with burnt chili."}
{"text":"Really loved this place while I was in college: easy, affordable, and solid food. The staff are extremely nice and really made my experience that much better (hence the 5 stars). Growing up on hot pot, it was hard to find something similar in Pittsburgh. Once this place showed up, I stopped feeling so homesick. The AYCE aspect of this place draws in many people, especially college students who come here in groups! It's a great place for meals with friends and to have some good food. I'd really recommend it to anyone who lives in the area.  There's a fairly wide variety of meats, seafood, vegetables, noodles, and more, so everyone can have their favorites. The meats are usually frozen, so if you get a plate of meat that's hard to separate, just use the broth as a defroster! This place was my go-to dinner place on weekends during my stint in Pittsburgh, and I'll truly miss the comfortable atmosphere here."}
{"text":"It's a nice atmosphere.  Don't try the funnel cake. I loved the server but the owner refused to take off the greasy excuse for funnel cake but I should've known better to order funnel cake from this place. It's a nice date experience. I may return to give it a second try but what kind of owner doesn't want to make sure their customers are satisfied. The fact that he didn't come out to address my issue didn't sit with me well. You cook your own food here so it wasn't like he was busy."}
{"text":"All you can eat, $19.99, for a maximum of two hours.  Yeah, the value's there and an adequate selection of items of meat and veggies.  What's nice, each person gets their own soup pot powered by an induction station they can control via the knobs right under the table.  A central sauce station allows for mixing your very own custom dipping sauce.  I prefer the old fashioned soy sauce, little vinegar and hot chili oil mix.  Not only do they serve hot pot, they have noodle soups, appetizers and tabletop BBQ options.  Appetizers are average, haven't yet ordered any noodle soups and the tabletop BBQ didn't quite match up to Nak Won Garden.  On the second visit, I noticed the next table over eating barbequed chicken wings and asked about those.  The server explained that it's not on the menu and is special order only for his family member.  He whipped up a small order for us and it was quite a tasty dish.  Service stands out here.  Every server possessed a warm, cheerful smile and dropped by often to ensure satisfaction.    Recommendation: try their Hot Pot, table BBQ not so much."}
{"text":"Hot pot.  Yum right?  You figure you would be able to switch from a 9.99 set to the all you can eat but for some reason, it's not allowed.  That'd be ok if the 9.99 set wasn't a tiny plate.  This, plus the extremely dirty utensils means a bad experience.   I mean hot pot itself should be a 4 star by default but given the dumb policies here, it's safe to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"My first trip to a place like this. I love food so I knew I couldn't go wrong with a place like this. Went with a group and it worked out well. We were all able to pick everything we wanted to try and had an entire table full. For a price of $22.99 a person it is a good deal. Make sure you go when you have time to enjoy and take your time."}
{"text":"The waitress serving for lunch special is terrible.She yelled at me like I owe her a hundred bucks?"}
{"text":"Super good and our service was excellent !  Hostess and waitress were super friendly and cute as could be!  I will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"I give this place a temporary 2. They always say that you should let a restaurant work out its kinks before you go. I guess they were right. Both times I have went to Top Shabu-Shabu, the service has been pretty terrible. You write down your selections for your pot, but then the servers just bring it all out an once. I was with a group of 8 and it was a nightmare trying to figure out who order what. The staff constantly brought wrong things and constantly forgot items.   However, this is the most authentic style hot pot in Pittsburgh. The food is quite good and reminds me of Asia. You can believe me because this place is always filled with Asians.   Now, on my most recent visit, we had a pretty horrible experience. I found a rubber band in my vegetables. I only figured it out as I was stirring my pot. I have no idea how long I was cooking the rubber band or how it got into my soup.   We argued back and forth in Chinese. Their only solution was to offer me 10% off my bill.  I wasn't in the mood to make a scene I accepted this, and they gave us all free dessert.   I won't be back for awhile, but I will eventually go back.   Be sure to try the ??, or as they call it, the Chinese fritter!"}
{"text":"Delicious and good price! We ordered a la cart, 4 soups for 6 people, though we probably could've gotten 2 or 3. I loved the pumpkin and the meat was pretty good! Plus the service was great! The waitresses and waiters were all very kind and patient. Definitely recommend! Only bad thing was I was almost too stuffed to walk by the end haha!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for hot pot and have always had a good experience! For $10, their lunch special is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. You get to pick a meat, a fish/meat ball, a type of noodle, and it comes with vegetables as well. I love coming to their AYCE hot pot for dinner - definitely come with friends so you can try more items on their menu I really like how you can mix your own sauces as well. The staff is always very attentive and friendly.  The only thing keeping them from five stars is their lunch hot food bar in my opinion. I've only tried it once, but everything I got was extremely salty and tasted like there was a ton of MSG in it. It is only $7 and you get a large portion of food, but I probably won't be back for this. Stick with the hot pot!"}
{"text":"The all you can eat hot pot is a pretty good deal, given that we are in Pittsburgh and there isn't a whole lot of competition. It's good to come as a group since everyone gets  to choose what to put in their individual pots and splitting the check is easy. The thin sliced lamb and beef were pretty good, but they were served still frozen solid. I like that you can also get Korean rice cakes and fish balls. However the fish filet and shrimp we got just didn't seem that fresh so I would skip them in the future.   The food is solid but I felt like I was inconveniencing the servers when we asked for water. Also, their style is Chinese hot pot, not their Japanese namesake, shabu shabu. (I still haven't a place for proper shabu shabu.) They do have a mix of Japanese, Korean and Chinese options. I still like it, it's just more of a fusion hot pot."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. The other day my friends and I wanted to go there for dinner to celebrate friends birthdays. We made a reservation because we have six people. The person who wrote down our reservation told us the only time available is 6:15, and we cannot all make it at 6:15. He informed us it's okay if most of us are presented. When five of us got there, the guy (I think it's the owner) told us we don't have a reservation. After awhile they figured someone had crossed off our reservation for some reasons. The guy refused to seat us because there's one person missing. We told the guy what we were told on the phone, and he said that's not our policy. His employee told us the wrong thing, so we have to wait. We were waiting for thirty mins until our one friend got here. When we all arrived and waited another 5-10 mins, he told us there's no available seating for us, we'll have to wait for awhile. We got so frustrated so we just went somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love hot pot (aka \"asian fondue\"), so I thought this place was authentic and awesome.  I really like that everyone gets their own pot of broth in which to boil meat and veggies, and that you can order all he meat and veggies a la carte.  That alone makes it an excellent option for any vegetarians or vegans looking to try something new (as well as the omnivores out there, obviously).  The bar of sauces with fixings to add--spices, garlic, chili-- was great as well.  I recommend the mixed tofu platter and the mixed mushroom plate.  My only negative comments are about ambiance: the acoustics were poor/ it was very loud, so I had a lot of difficulty hearing and sustaining a conversation with the 5 friends with whom I went to dinner across the very large table.  Because of that, it might be a better experience as a couple or in a small group.  Also, I wish all restaurants that are not explicitly sports bars would get rid of TVs, but that's just my bias.  Shout out to the service staff, who were excellent and very attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today for their Oakland Restaurant Week special: $6 for their 3 dish special. So this review is based on that. This includes rice or noodles, soup or an egg roll (pork or veggie), and three of their entrees which there were a ton of options! I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't even know they did this sort of thing. They had your staples like general tso's, honey chicken, beef and broccoli, spicy chicken, etc. But there were also a ton of things I didn't know the name of but they all looked delicious but three was definitely more than enough for me.   I went with the noodles, pork egg roll, General tso's chicken, green beans with some sort of meat, and the beef with broccoli. The noodles were good and cooked well. The pork egg roll had a crispy exterior but I don't think the inside was cooked thoroughly because the veggies definitely tasted a little raw. And my three entrees were delicious for your typical American-Chinese food cuisine. I was glad that they had a lot of veggies with the meat instead of it just being only meat. And for $6 the portion of food that you get is ginormous in my opinion. Friend got the fried calamari and said he'd probably skip it the next time. It just wasn't good.   Seating was a little hectic because you kind of just sit wherever since there is no service. You just find a seat, eat, and then get up to leave. Oh, for this you pay before grabbing your food and sitting. There has to be a better way to manage this but it was super busy and hectic so I guess there really isn't. And the plus is that you don't need to pay tip, so that makes this all super cheap.  For the portion of food that you get and with how cheap it was (remember this was for Oakland Restaurant Week), I definitely thought stopping by here was worth it. I still have yet to try their shabu shabu. But that's next on my list!  P.S. We asked about their Thai rolled ice cream and were told that they are not offering it for the winter and will be back around the end of March. Which is disappointing, but it makes sense I guess."}
{"text":"Had to try this place and honestly it wasn't that good.  First off, let's start with the sauces. Their sauce bar is sort of weak, there weren't any sort of selection. The chili oil was burnt, it tasted funny. To sum it up....there were only 5-6 sauces....choose wisely.  Then we get to sitting down and getting into the broth. There were only 3 different types of broth. Which we had all three and tried it. At first it looked great, then we tried a taste and it was bland.  The menu weren't anything special. There were stuff I thought shouldn't be extra, for example imitation crabmeat.  And finally the service, we had marked stuff on our menu that wasn't ever given to us. The table wasn't properly cleaned. And the burner for the hot pot wasn't heating up properly (we turned it to the highest).     I wouldn't come back here again, especially since you're paying $22 then taxes which was about $24."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for business and we wanted to try something different so we ended up here. Parking is not easy to find.  It is located in a college area and we thought the prices were decent. They offer sushi and hotpot.  We had the hotpot ( all you can eat) for approximately $23.00pp.  You make check marks on all the items that you want on the paper menu and they will deliver all the items to your table.  The food was delicious and we enjoyed the experience. This is a dinner that takes time so don't go if you are in a rush.  We were there for about 2 hours.  They also have a full bar. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Try out their lunches and Korean BBQ! Not bad but not as filling as I'd like.  Their hotpot is delicious but on the pricy side for a college budget. Try sharing the meat and veggies to help with the cost."}
