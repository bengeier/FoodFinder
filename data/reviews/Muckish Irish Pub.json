{"text":"I was at this pub last night and what a great time. John, the owner had fantastic entertainment and the most delicious roast beef buffet I have ever enjoyed. After 8 years in business, this place is really firing on all cylinders. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here.  It made mt wife sick!

Service was OK... but what do you expect when the place is mostly empty.  Went here due to Chantal's rave review of the place and we were left wondering if she actually went here, or if it was somewhere else.  The prices were OK... beer was OK... Wings were not great, I've had worse, I've had better.  My wife had the Caesar Chicken wrap from which she had to remove the \"chicken\" because in her words \"it doesn't feel or taste like real chicken.  It seems synthetic - like Tofu.\"  She was sick to her stomach later.

Just to take it a step further - other than having a green theme in the decor, I couldn't figure out what was Irish about the place.  There were only 2 Irish beers on tap - The standard Guiness & Harp - the rest was mostly Molson's crap.  There was nothing on the \"menu\", a laminated sheet of paper printed in green, that would indicate anything Irish.  Not even an Irish stew.

Like I said... don't go here. :-("}
{"text":"Been here plentttttyyy of times since my last review. The owner now knows my face...slightly embarrassing BUT it's a great place to go and chill to get some good grub! Let's talk about the nachos, I really don't like nachos most places and would NEVER pay for them blah, but here...WORTH EVERY PENNY. I scarf those babies down like it was my last meal!!! These things are LOADED, chili, peppers, cheese, olives, sour cream, beans, basically everything I need to complete my life. I'm pretty sure I dream about those nachos at night. 
All they're other pub fare is still really good, the burgers are fantastic, fries are deliciously salty, one time I had the potato skins which were great. 
The place may look a little dumpy but the food is always amazing and I haven't had a dirty menu yet. The patio can get a little loud on game nights or if there is a horde of drunkies that have come in from playing ball (one time I came across this), but for the most part everyone is very respectful. Needless to say I'll be back whenever my craving for nachos flares up!"}
{"text":"For a local, excellent.  Music seems quieter now - maybe I'm going deaf.  Staff thoughtful and considerate.  Often fresh oysters on Fridays at $1 a piece - extreme value."}

You clearly know nothing about good food or Irish culture! Cause if you did the owner John McFadden has a full house on most weekends and week days. He was born in Ireland. And I'm sorry you guys had nothing better to do than leave a crappy review. Did you notice the  of views that are 5 star. You stick out like the a sore thumb. Wonderful Irish Pub. The owners are always there and would of helped you in any way. Cheers. 

Hope your wife is over the flu lol"}
{"text":"Dropped in on this place on the strength of Chantal's review.  It's funny how different one person's experience is from another's.  Maybe I would like this place more under different circumstances.  But here's the circumstances I encountered...

So it's an Irish pub.  You know you're in trouble when you walk into an Irish pub, ask for Guiness, and get this response:  \"A what? Oh Guiness? You mean on draft, then.\"  Evidently I was the first person to drink from their keg lines in a long while.  That was scary. But I forged on...

Because the food was well recommended, I asked for a menu.  What arrived was a laminated menu that was so covered in grime, it looked like it had been grabbed off the tool bench of a transmission repair shop.  

I decided to skip lunch, drank my beer and wondered if it would kill me. 

The second star is because I never actually ate there and maybe I would have found the food to be as good as Chantal says it is."}
{"text":"It does not look like your average Canadian Irish pub, the building is in an industrial area. However the folks who run the place are Irish - I saw a Doors of Dublin poster on the wall. Also there is GAA sports on TV there on the weekend, so if you are actually from Ireland, that might be of interest to you.

I went here with my boyfriend to watch a hockey playoffs game last year. The breakfast was good. Someone was still struggling to watch soccer on one of the TVs but most people were watching the hockey, it was a fun atmosphere. I would like to go out to see live music at some point."}
{"text":"I have a real problem with Thom H's review.  I have gone to \"The Muck\" many a time and to say they didn't know what you were talking about with regards to getting you a Guinness(proper spelling Thom) is ridiculous.  They pretty much serve nothing but and it is a fine pour.
As for a review...it is a friendly place with great food, great owner named John and um...
anyway, it might not look appealing from the outside but it is truly nice inside."}
{"text":"I have only been there a few times. The prices are responsible. The food is good. The environment is good.  Parking is a pain.  But I enjoy my self every time I go."}
{"text":"One word.  FUN!  We came here one night because it was close and our gang wanted some time to hang out together.  They have karaoke on some nights.  I think it was a Tuesday!  FUN!  Good sound system with regulars who just want to have fun.  Down to earth and fun.  Basic food menu and a decent choice of stuff to drink.  I hope we get to come back because, as I said, it was FUN!"}
