We ordered the lemon chicken, beef pad Thai and vegetable Chow Mein for pick up.  The chicken lemon came dry with the sauce on the side. We were given a small container of very thick lemon sauce that was not easy to spread over the chicken. We ended up with dry pieces of chicken and what looked like thick marmalade that could not soak the chicken.  The Beef pad Thai was no better. The noodles were way over cooked and very very little beef. Basically we received beef flavoured noodles.  But the worst was the the vegetable chow mein.  It was so salty that nobody in the family could stomach it.  We called to complain. We just wanted to switch the vegetable chow mein as we really could not eat it.  We weren't crazy about the other dishes but  at least they were edible. The response I got was \"This is how we make the vegetable chow mein! We can make you a new one but it will taste the same\"  I asked to find out what other vegetable dish I could replace it for.  Something that would not be so salty.  I was told that if I WANTED TO REPLACE THE DISH I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE NEW ONE! I explained that the dish was basically intact as we could not eat it and could bring it back to show them.  The woman I spoke with was incredible rude and unwilling to help. All we wanted was a vegetable dish of the same price to replace the horrible Chow Mein. Not an unreasonable request!  
DON'T EAT HERE IF YOU WANT GOOD FOOD, OR EVEN JUST GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH!
Go to 'Red Chillie' on Nothinghill gate instead."}
{"text":"This place has really good tasty food ;-).

The food is really good quality and not your typical take out Chinese place.  It is up there with some gourmet Chinese places I've eaten at.  It isn't heavy with fake sauces or grease. They also speak Spanish which is pretty cool since I speak Spanish.  

I highly recommend this place."}
