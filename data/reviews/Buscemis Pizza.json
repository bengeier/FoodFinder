{"text":"I love this place! It's fast, cheap, and really good! We always get the same order-large pizza and cheese sticks. It's enough to easily feed a family with kids! The best part is the pepperonis! They're the smaller ones that bring back memories of my childhood. So awesome!  I'd highly recommend this place. The worst part about them is the fact that they're closed on Mondays. That's the perfect pizza night! Hopefully that will change soon!"}
{"text":"just finished our first try. no regrets! definitely better than   nationwide chains. we had planned on going out for NY style pizza elsewhere, but the weather was nicer than expected, and we worked too hard around the house. delivery? sold. (but take note, there is a $2 fee)  antipasto salad- shredded lettuce is kind of lame, but otherwise good stuff. balsamic dressing was good. lots of olives (not fancy ones, but that's ok), banana peppers, cheese and salami, etc. I'm not a big meat eater, so the meats were lost on me :) my fianc√© approved, tho  veggie pizza- fresh stuff and lots of it. can def taste the difference. the crust is thicker than my New Jersey born man typically goes for, but it was good. probably even better in-house. delivery boxes can't help but make it a lil soggy.   we'd order from here again..."}
{"text":"Great job, finally some decent pizza in the area, real sauce..not that sweet sauce bought in a 5 gallon bucket...Great crispy pepperoni, soft crust and a great price...but seriously it's not real Italian but hey we are not in Italy. The BEST I've had around here, and no I don't work there...peace and love baby cakes...enjoy your pie."}
{"text":"Well. My family ordered a large three topping pizza with boneless wings. I wasn't in love with it nor my husband. Cheese wasn't that good, sauce mediocre at best, crust super hard and too crispy. Won't be ordering again."}
