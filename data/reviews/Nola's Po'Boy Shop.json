{"text":"Best sandwich shop in the area I've been to. Me and a buddy got the raging cajun, with shrimp, pepper jack, pickles, tomatoes, etc. Bread was very fresh, shrimp was very crispy and tasty. Fries also had a nice taste and seasoning.  Definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous two star review.  It's decent however not outstanding.   Went on a Saturday evening at 6:30 and the place was empty.  The man running the counter was very polite, said they made everything fresh that day.  Fresh is not how I would describe it.  Their only dessert is Sara Lee pie, the fries are frozen food service fries, and the pork sandwich has sliced roast pork (not pulled pork like the menu says) that is precooked, pre-portioned and reheated in a saut√© pan.  Sandwiches are of good size but the bread is chewy.   The gumbo was mediocre. The flavor was pretty one dimensional and pretty skimpy on the meat.  My cup of gumbo had one single tiny piece of andouille in it.   They need to work on integrating actual fresh food into their menu that's made to order (not reheated to order) and develop their flavors better.   Didn't have the bold flavors I was expecting."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but the food is not fresh. Everything is frozen and has no flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious!! The Ragin Cajun Poboy is flavorful and filling! We also tried the Jumbalaya which had an authentic taste with out too much spice. The Gumbo is smoky and rich and thier french fries are the yummy curly fries with cajun seasoning. Still have yet to try something I dislike. SOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"May, 2015..brand new place in Strongsville.  A New Orlean's themed casual place, they have 7 tables inside for seating, plus your usual carry-out. Bright and simply decorated inside, with jazz playing overhead.  Had the Ragin' Cajun Po'Boy.  Basically, a sub sandwich with fried shrimp and your usual accompaniments.  First, let's say the shrimp was excellent!  Lightly breaded in a cornmeal style of breading made them very crisp and tasty.  The roll it was served on was as fresh as anything baked today.  They also put a Creole style mayonnaise on the sandwich.  Would have been better with more of it.  Big sandwich, plenty for a big guy.  Subbed the fries for a side of Creole Coleslaw, which was delicious.  On a previous visit, I had the Wuffalaletta.  A classic muffaletta dropped on a made to order waffle rather than the flat bread it usually comes with.  The thing was huge and delicious.  Came with fries which are battered and Cajun seasoned.  The chicken & sausage gumbo was great, too.  The only thing holding this place back from 5 stars is the lack of a liquor license.  It's hard to have New Orleans fare without a Hurricane to wash it down with!  Also, they do not have wi-fi, but you can jump on Shinto's next door :-)"}
{"text":"stopped in today and had the Ragin' Cajun po' boy.i really liked it. it's a crunchy breaded shrimp sandwich and comes topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles and a creole sauce (not sure if it's mayo or mustard but it's really good).  since we were leaving shortly after our stop for an evening w/family and friends with smoked pork and brisket i didn't order the gumbo. i'm curious to stop back and try it. Danielle's father and brother also rave about the Crescent City Scrambler. will try that also."}
{"text":"Shrimp Po Boy sandwich was amazing! The sweet potato Pie was perfectly balanced. My dinind partner tried the Nola's Roast Beef which I snuck a taste of, it was yummy as well."}
{"text":"The jambalaya was awful.  The chicken had no taste and looked (and tasted) like it came out of a can.  The rice could have been mistaken for mashed potatoes it was so mushy and slimy.  I was expecting amazing flavors and it just failed in every aspect.  The gumbo had a strange flavor that I just couldn't get past.    I was hoping for so much more."}
{"text":"I have been very excited to try this place since it opened. The $9 a sandwich originally kept me away, but with the BOGO 50% off we figured we would give it a shot. The sandwiches are large and come with fries. Two people can eat one order IMO.   I got the shrimp po boy and my husband got a catfish one. Both were good, but did not blow us away good. (I had high expectations.) my kids (5, 6 and 13) really liked both sandwiches, but I was hoping for more spice flavor. It was really didn't have much depth.   We also got fried green tomatoes at the encouraging of the nice gentleman taking our order. They were good. (There went my cost savings.)  The Cajun coleslaw can be substituted for the fries for the sandwiches. It tasted fresh and had good flavor.   Will we go back??  Probably. Strongsville is packed with food options though so we will likely try some of the other places first before returning.   I do wish the owners the best of luck. You can see they are passionate about their little restaurant."}
{"text":"Really not understanding where all the praise for this place is coming from... and to be honest I'm pretty disappointed I made the drive out to Strongsville to try it. It's a mediocre sandwich at best, certainly not anywhere close to the glory of a real NOLA po'boy.   The bread for the sandwiches was disappointing, the texture isn't ideal for a po'boy since it's too thick and chewy, and didn't have the beautifully crunch on the outside and fluffiness on the inside that lends itself well to a heavily stacked sandwich. It's pretty clear that the fillings are kept frozen and heated up when ordered, unfortunately for my friend who joined me, not heated up well enough as the pork on his sandwich was cold, and his fries were still frozen.  The shrimp on the shrimp po'boy was pretty good, it had a nice cornmeal breading, but again, it's pretty clear it came out of a bag of frozen goods.  All the sandwiches are in the $8/$9 range, are well sized for the price, and are served with fries. Some of the sandwiches are served with cajun seasoned fries, and some with plain fries, although it's not clear to me why the fry choice varies by sandwich.   The service was great, the gentleman manning the register who I'm assuming was either the owner or the manager was very friendly and apologetic when my friend pointed out his fries were still frozen, and brought us a fresh batch right away. The inside is also pretty nice, small dining room, but set up well with mural like paintings on the wall and jazz music playing in the background.   Unfortunately, in my opinion the service didn't make up for the lackluster meal, and I don't see myself coming back here or recommending to others.   Oh! and to the gentleman complaining about no wifi- you'll be happy to know they now have available wifi for guests!"}
