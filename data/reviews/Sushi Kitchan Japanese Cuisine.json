{"text":"Likely some of the worst sushi I've ever had, and that's coming from someone who will settle for safeway sushi in a pinch. The rice was extremely vinegar-y and the fish and other fillings seemed sub-par, perhaps past expiration date? I recall that the sauce in one of my rolls tasted like straight up ketchup. Felt sick for several hours following. Eugh. It was the first time I refused to tip at a restaurant.  Wouldn't eat the sushi again if you paid me."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened and it was my second time eating here. Both times provided delicious sushi - especially being in the (deep) south end of the city.  All the fish was quite fresh and were generous portions. The chef and server were very friendly and the food came out quickly.  The restaurant is cozy and modern.  
My only beef with this place is that they do not have high chairs or a changing station - not ideal when you are with a baby."}
{"text":"Ever since my trip to Vancouver in August I've had a slight addiction to sushi. I've been travelling all over the city for the best sushi (not just in taste but price) and when I stumbled upon this little gem I was thoroughly impressed. The sushi was fresh and tasty, there was plenty of variety, and the price was amongst the best I've found. For sushi this good I'm a little surprised it hasn't been busy any time I've went. I would highly recommend Sushi Kitchan to new and experienced sushi lovers alike.
