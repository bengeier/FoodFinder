{"text":"me & my boyfriend go there almost every sunday for brunch. love it. their roast beef benito is amazing with spicy holidaise sauce! yummers"}
{"text":"I went to Bar_One for Sunday brunch with a dear friend who I hadn't seen in a long while. I called the day before to reserve a table on the back patio (FYI they accept reservations for seatings before 11 a.m  only), and when I got there was seated with a smile. I quickly realized that eating on the patio on a day  like this would cause me to melt away, so I asked the server if there happened to be a table free inside (in the air conditioning!).  This was after we had ordered and already started sipping our delicious mimosa's!
Lucky for us, there was a table free and our server was nothing but helpful and friendly throughout the transition inside.
Now for the eats! 
Dee-liiissshhh-oouuuss!!!
I had the Ozo Buco (egg in the hole) with smoked Salmon and spicy hollandaise. The bread was thick, and soft, and the hollandise was draped inside meticulously as not to take over the dish. I also ordered a side of peameal ($2) to complete my tasting, and I was in heaven!!
My brunch companion ordered the Bar_One Brunch and was just as impressed. Eggs, potatos, pancakes.. The perfect portions to make a successful meal.

I will go so far to say that Bar_One has one of the best brunches in the city.  Plus, who can resist an atmosphere that is modern yet has a family feel?
Well done guys, I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bar One has the absolute best brunch in the city. Sometimes. Like anything, it all depends on what you're in the mood for.
If you're looking for a sloppy, greasy breakfast, then don't go here.

They have this one breakfast called The Cruz and I literally salivate sometimes thinking of it.

From lunch onwards, I think it's mostly gourmet pizza. They have a nice back patio in the summer, but no smoking and the staff are a bit Euro-cold and snobby. Nothing you can't ignore, cause the service isn't bad.

It's also kinda a nice place to go for a quiet drink with a friend in the winter.
Hot women in their 30s who look like The Wilson Sisters (Heart) seem to always be floating around."}
{"text":"Bar_One has become my regular brunch spot, so I thought it was time to update my review. 

Bar_One's food is always spot on, the servers are fantastic, their coffee is the best I've had*, and their music is always awesome (they were playing the \"Garden State\" sountrack last week. Swoon!). I have the Cruz every time I go, minus the two times I tried other dishes which were also fantastic. Carmen's tip: whatever you do, get a chocolate chip pancake -- they are effing delicious.

Bottom line: I love Bar_One as much as I love my momma -- and that's a lot! Just don't sit at the table for two by the window -- that's my spot. :-)


*Although admittedly I don't drink coffee everyday."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch, with a surprisingly short wait on a Sunday morning.  There are a lot of interesting items on the menu--I had the Ovo Buco (an \"egg in the hole\" sandwich served with spinach, brie, hollandaise and roasted tomato).  It was delicious!  But I could probably have eaten two of them to fill me up.  The place isn't cheap, but the food is good and the service is fast."}
{"text":"I had a lovely end of term Christmas dinner at Bar One! They were able to accomodate a group of about 15 of us despite being a pretty small place. They also let us bring a cake and were okay with separate bills - grazie Bar One.

The menu is quite long (and comes strapped to a clip board with an elastic band - random?), and has a good mix of vegetarian/meat/seafood dishes. The focus is on Calabrian-style homemade pasta and pizza. I had the mushroom papardelle pasta with a light tomato sauce. I loved it - full of garlic and large pieces of forest mushrooms. A couple of friends ordered the gnocchi, which looked quite good, but they  described the sauce as lacking \"something.\"  I also tried a bite of the portobello, smoked provolone and hot pepper pizza, which was fantastic. The smoked provolone added so much flavour, and the crust was thin and crisp. 


Overall, the restaurant and service was great. Main dishes are about $15-$20, and the wine list had a great mix of expensive/inexpensive wines. I would definitely recommend for a date or small party."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy little place.  Despite the gorgeous Saturday weather, there was no waiting.  We scored a comfy booth table toward the back.  

We had Italian sausage & potato hash as well as an order of French toast with walnut and caramelized bananas.  The hash was beautifully presented with a small side salad and two eggs were perfectly cooked on top of the hash.  But some additional seasoning and larger chunks of Italian sausage in the hash would have gone a long way.

The french toast was nicely done, loved the walnuts, caramelized bananas and warm maple syrup combination.

Above average brunch spot in Toronto.  Fresh ingredients and good quality food.  Service was friendly and personable."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a lovely stroll across a great part of Queen Street before meeting up for brunch at Bar One.  Not sure if I just happened to arrive early enough or if Bar One just doesn't get the usual brunch crowd, but there was absolutely no wait for a table.

Bar One has an espresso machine for all you latte and cappuccino lovers.  I just tried their regular coffee.  It was pretty good - no complaints.  For some reason, the orange juice takes forever.  We ordered a glass of OJ at the very beginning of our meal, we reminded them a few times about it, and we still didn't have it at the end of our meal.

The menu is huge - lots of choices, all very interesting.  The food was very delicious and the portions are almost too big - I couldn't for the life of me finish my meal.  Presentation of the meal is also quite impressive.

The food was terrific, the atmosphere was pretty good, but the service ruined my experience at Bar One.  Hopefully my next visit will be more enjoyable.

P.S.  Washrooms are downstairs (and not the nicest)."}
{"text":"Best Brunch in town! I've tried many items on the menu, which I love. But, the Bar One Brunch includes a lot of everything and satisfies those with both sweet and salty teeth- like myself. The Egg-in-a-hole offers bacon, salmon or a vegetarian version with tomato slices with spicy or regular hollandaise sauce. A real salty-treat. The french toast mixes bananas, walnuts and thick slices of toast. Sweet! Going back to the Bar One Brunch- blueberry or banana pancakes, eggs, toast, potatoes and both green and fruit salads. This has it all! Possibly enough to 2, but I'm too hungry to share. 
For those who have moved on to lunch or dinner, the pizzas and pastas are served in a cute local booth-lined diner scene. Back patio and front nice for coffee in the summer."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped in here for brunch, and I'm so glad we did. The selections were inventive, unusual, and REALLY great. I had the Bar One Brunch, which included eggs, pancakes, meat, and potatoes. The portion was huge and even though I didn't finish it all, I wasn't hungry again until 8pm that night.

I'll definitely come here again for brunch and hopefully sit out on the patio as we did this time."}
{"text":"A really lovely place with a cute set-up! I like the colour-coding going on here and the servers are incredibly nice. Beware of washrooms though... they're from another dimension!

Not busy on a lazy Sunday afternoon which is perfect because we were able to finish our meal without haste.

I ordered the raw salmon w/ poached eggs and spicy hollandaise sauce and dang, waaaaaaaaaay too savoury for my tastebuds. (However, it was very well-presented!) Really couldn't handle the overpowering 'flavour' of the dish. Wish I opted for banana pancakes or the \"ovo buca\" (both of which were dishes my friends ordered). 

That said, I really want to give this place another try. Perhaps a pizza or their pancakes."}
{"text":"I have to give Bar One a 5 star review, because I've been here a lot and always loved everything about it! 

I love sitting on the front patio, the back patio and at the bar. The shared tables aren't my fave, but one time I was only a couple feet away from Sook-Yin Lee (http://www.cbc.ca/dnto/sook-yins-blog/) and was positive about it because I could hear her talking! I know she's only a CBC celebrity, but I am a fan, so it impressed me.

The salads and pizzas are excellent. I have only been for brunch once, but those were some good eggs, too.

The staff is good, it's in a convenient location, the plates are good for sharing. It can get noisy if you sit at one of the communcal tables, but you may see a CBC-level celebrity! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Big dishes, great service and a comfortable environment. Bar one is a home run for brunch. We found it off of yelp and couldn't be more happy :)"}
{"text":"Bar One has taken the 'waiting' out of brunch. Maybe it's because I'm crotchety, but I don't want to stand in line for 30 minutes to get a table to eat my favourite meal of the week. They take *reservations*!! Very exciting.

It also doesn't hurt that their food is totally delicious. I like everything about this place. I recommend the Cruz (Chorizo! Goat Cheese! Chipotle Sauce!) or the bar one brunch, because if I need something with my eggs and bacon, it is a delicious pancake. 

They have a great patio in the back, a small one in the front and some inside too. My only complaint about this place is that you can't get banana and chocolate chips in your pancakes. You have to pick one or the other, which is a crime against my tastebuds."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch experience there on a rainy Saturday afternoon, for the following points:

1) Atmosphere was trendy and sleek, without being cold

2) We didn't have to wait for a seat

3) Most brunch entrees were under $12 

4) My steak and eggs were delicious for about $14. The steak was small but very well done and I thought the portion size was just right for me.

5) All my other friends enjoyed the Ovo Buco (an \"egg in the hole\" sandwich served with spinach, brie, hollandaise and roasted tomato). It was just the right size for us ladies.

A solid place for brunch - I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"It is good in a pinch when you have a group that can't decide what to do or where to eat. The dilemna comes from the fact that the food is always different and not always the best. The mojitos are tasty and go down in a very smooth way - like sliding on a wet banana."}
{"text":"They do have great breakfast here. I'll give them that. The food is great, the menu is inventive and interesting, everything tastes fresh and clean.

But that's no reason to hire jerks for wait staff and just expect people to deal with it.

My experience here was awful -- it consisted of myself and two friends meeting for brunch and the place being filled to the brim with hipster parents and their spoiled spawn. 

Wait staff are beyond rude -- apparently if you don't want to buy a drink, they will be very difficult in providing you with water. They sent in our orders at all the wrong times and one friend ended up having to pack up her meal because she was going to be late for work. No apologies made, no one seems to care if you're coming or going unless you show up with a Maclaren fashion stroller and a screaming baby dressed in Burberry. The only smile we got was when we paid.

Like I said, food is good, albeit not cheap (brunch meals start at $11), but I will never go back based purely on the fact that the staff leave a bad taste in my mouth. Also FYI, I think they stopped serving lunch and are open only for breakfast and dinner now."}
