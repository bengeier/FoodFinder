{"text":"Really enjoyed this place and how cheap it is. Prefer the chicken over the beef though. Love the side of grilled veggies."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would! Horrible food! Chicken was undercooked had a funny expired smell to it. The salad tasted old, literally two bites into my plate and I threw it out. Terrible! If you are thinking about ordering from here think again, unless you want food poisoning! !!"}
{"text":"Being pregnant, I was craving Mediterranean and saw that this restaurant delivered.  I was so excited and put my order in through Grubhub at 7:30. It said my order would be ready about 8:40. Then, I got a text 10 minutes later that said it would be ready about 9:10. I understood because it was a Friday night and they were probably busy. 

9:10 came and went, so about 9:30 I called the restaurant to check on things and the 2 numbers I called were busy and just hung up. I called Grubhub to see if maybe they had any information on my order. They said they would contact me after speaking with the restaurant. At 9:55 I still hadn't gotten a call from the restaurant OR grubhub,  so I ordered from somewhere else that I knew was reliable. At 10:07 the delivery guy called me nonchalantly and asked for my gate code! I'm like are you serious??? Although I was craving that food, I let him know that unfortunately they took 2 1/2 hours to get there and because I didn't think they were coming, I ordered from somewhere else. The driver just said \"ok\"! No apology, no offer to make things right, just \"ok\" and got off the phone. By his reaction I'm assuming this happens a lot! 

If this is how they treat their customers it's a shame! There's so many other Mediterranean places out here and I will gladly take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and beef kebab .Beef was ok but chicken I don't no what was that I don't think I'm going to order from there anymore tomato and jalapeño been Grild one side only"}
{"text":"Always cooked to order and serving portions are great! The chicken kabobs are my favorite and perfectly seasoned every time!"}
{"text":"Food is not good.   Think before u go. I don't money back 
But I want them to try the food they make at least 
Not cooked. Messed plates 
Disgusting"}
{"text":"This is the first time we've eaten here.  We love this place.  Ambiance is clean, food is awesome.  Healthy food ROCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered via Yelp's EAT24 app and our food took just shy of 2 hours to be delivered. Our receipt said that it left the restaurant 40 minutes before we received it, and we only live about a mile away. Our food was barely hot when it arrived.

Rice and pita were delicious, as were the veggies. My meat was so chewy that i could not eat it.

My recommendation is to NOT order delivery, just go in instead."}
{"text":"Very disappointed at this place. Ordered for delivery through grubhub and I received a confirmation that my delivery will be ready in an hour. An hour and a half later, no food. When I called they said they never got the confirmation. May have been grubhub's fault, but the girl who answered said \"oh we ran out of kabobs like 2-3 hours ago so you're not gonna get your food either way\" It took a lot not to yell at her. I called grubhub and they claimed the restaurant did get my order, apologized, refunded my money and gave me a coupon. So they rectified the issue. This restaurant though, failed to do that. A simple apology would have helped. They could've offered other stuff and maybe since my kids and I were starving, I probably would have ate anything they offered and gladly pay for it. I will never order or eat here again."}
{"text":"A weak option if you want Mediterranean food on this side of town. I ordered the chicken lula and chicken kabob. The food taste good and is made fresh. The menu is limited with no traditional condiments. There was also no jasmine rice but instead regular white rice that was over cooked and mushy.

If your order is for delivery expect an hour to hour and a half wait."}
{"text":"Awful, irresponsible and disrespectful. And maybe even lethal. I ordered through here (not the first time) to go through Uber eats. If you choose to solicit yourself via a delivery service (to up your sales) - pay attention. Apparently they don't actually have baklava. The last time I ordered they called to replace the item. Today they sent me a soup full of onions and peppers (because an appropriate substitute for cake is a coffee cup of soup????) I specifically noted I have an allergy to both. Please view my photos to see their concern for allergies. Kabob corner clearly doesn't care. While they sent a side of wilted brown cucumber and a mushy compost of what I assume used to be chickpeas, my entire order was still coated in raw onion, with pepper and pepper sauce. Fortunately, UberEATS cares enough to refund inedible food. Though I really should just sue these idiots"}
{"text":"I have ordered approximately 5+ times, each order was fresh and very tasteful. Unfortunately my last order was delivered in 20 minutes, the delivery person said I was the first order for the day and it was slow at Kabob Corner. To my surprise the  (chicken kabob plate) chicken I could not chew or cut, the rice and bread was extremely hard and the whole dish was not edible. This was clearly food that was microwaved to death. Unfortunately,  because of this last bad experience, I will not order from Kabob Corner anymore."}
{"text":"I've remembered this place so I am ordering from here again. They didn't seem late. But the food is real Iranian style. I like the flavor on the meat and spices. IT's tasty and in vegas you can seem to rely on flavor too much out here. The rice is so so. I just prepare my own basmati rice myself to go with the meal. The meat is really good and I didn't experience no rudeness or bad vibe with my first order so I am ordering it again tonight. The good part is I placed an order for 3 meals and delivery says it was FREE. And I think you get your bang for your buck here without having to pay absorbent money for delivery. Another good reason to go here. I like their food a lot. I would not say this if it weren't true."}
{"text":"Kabob Corner 
Was excellent food & price is great
Food portions are more then you expect"}
{"text":"This is actually located inside Monte's New York Pizza.    Beef lula was a lot better than I expected in this area.  Meat was well seasoned and a generous portion.  Vegetables in salad (included) were crunchy and fresh.  The rice has room for improvement as it is just regular asian rice (I believe)."}
{"text":"Ordered #4 Chicken and beef kabob for delivery. I received just beef. I called and the lady who answered handled it was awesome. She sent the correct order to be delivered immediately. Really happy at how they handled the situation!! I should also note that I'm pregnant and that I love love LOVE the vegetable salad!! They should add it on as a extra side order on grubhub."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for 3 days and ate from kabob Korner twice.  The first time we came on a Saturday afternoon it was busy, but the staff was willing to accommodate our request for booth seating when one became available.  The server forgot to ask what drink we wanted and bought us both cokes, which wasn't a big deal (but I kinda wanted a Fanta) my hubby first asked for a zinger burger which they were out of , so he got a cheese burger.  He was happy with the burger's taste.  I ordered a philly beef sub and I was happy with mine.  All in all good experience.  
We ordered food to go on a Tuesday same time, we got a pick up time of 30 mins and they were on time.  This time hubby got the zinger burger which he liked (he did like the cheeseburger more) and I got a beef kabob pita wrap which I enjoyed.  If we are ever in Vegas again will def eat here."}
{"text":"The kabobs are beyond tender and flavorful, the best I've had in Vegas. I love the beef but others in my family have expressed a preference for the chicken. Even with how delicious the carnivore options are I have a special love in my heart for the jasmine rice, so well prepared and flavorful. Much better than any \"pilaf\" offerings at most Mediterranean restaurants. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The beef kabob is delicious, however, if it wasn't for being the only kabob place nearby, I would not order from here again. I have ordered here via Yelp Eat 24 three times and each time the order has taken an hour to be delivered and is only 10 minutes away from my house. The chicken kabob has a weird rubbery texture that tastes uncooked. I have ordered the chicken twice and noted the same texture both times. Lastly, on my most recent order, my fiancé and I both received pitas with mold on it. We called the restaurant and they were happy to bring us a new one and take the old one back, however it did put a damper on our meal.

If you were to go here, I would recommend ordering the beef kabob (not the lula) with no pita. I really enjoyed the dish as the meat and rice were very flavorful."}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews. I like to write good reviews! But I cannot recommend this place to anyone, especially after today. Let's start from the beginning. We received the little flyer at the door, so I figured \"Why the hell not? What could go wrong?\" That's where I was wrong. I should have figured this place was sketchy from me trying to call them for delivery. I had to call 4 times to even get a hold of them. The line wouldn't even connect the first 3 times. When I got a hold of someone, it was 6:06 p.m. Ordering my food, I find out they don't even have the beef lula. Whatever, it's all good! I order for me and my two friends and they give me the time of arrival (45 minutes to an hour). So we waited! ....and waited. And waited. And waited some more. I called them at 7:18 p.m. and said \"I ordered my food at 6:06. I would like to know where my food is.\" I receive the typical \"Uh...\" answer. Magically, the door bell rings, and the lady hung up on me!! I figured it wasn't even worth calling her back at this point. We get the food, and honestly, this was not worth it. All three drinks spilled in the bag the delivery man handed us. $2.50 each for drinks that weren't even full because half of it spilled everywhere... Absolute crap. On top of that, I ordered two Dr. Peppers and a Coke, and received three Cokes. Too hungry to complain, we said screw it and dived into our food! I ordered the beef kabob while my boyfriend and his brother ordered chicken and beef kabob. The beef was okay... I wouldn't say $12.99 okay, but it was okay. As for my boyfriend and his brother... Their chicken was RAW. FRIGGEN RAW. Had to toss it out... So disappointed. The whole process of waiting was ridiculous, and to get food that wasn't even that great... I can't recommend this establishment to anyone, and I feel like I wasted my $49.88 here. Trust me, there's better places out there. I feel like even if I had gone to pick up my food, there still would have been problems. Judging from the other reviews, I know I'm not the only one. Do yourself a favor and spend your hard earned money elsewhere.

Oh, also, they don't bother to tell you they charge you a dollar for use of credit card... I know it's a dollar, but you should at least have the decency to tell people. I figured there would be a delivery charge, so if you do decide to order from them, be prepared for both a credit card and delivery charge."}
{"text":"This is more a review of their issues. First off they have rude obnoxious jerkoffs dropping menus at homes. Second their phone doesn't work so you can call and complain. 
Even if place had best food ever this is enough disgust for me to never try it!"}
{"text":"the name is a little misleading because it's inside of Davids New York Pizzeria!! I took us a while to find it, so we decided to grab pizza from that place and asked the lady if this used to the kabob corner she said \"no\" so we were confused and she said \"this is the kabob corner inside David pizza\" LIKE OK ms. I'm foreign and rude (she had an accent) So from there she starts being rude with my sister and I as we were trying to decide what to get, we felt so rushed because of her attitude and manner of handling us (mind you we were literally the only customers) we just grabbed the first thing that looked good, I guess.. so AFTER I PAID she informs us it's gonna be a 30 min wait for the kabobs. We were starvingggg so we had to buy a salad to split. She brought us our salad and we were still being nice saying thank you while she had a blank face and said NOTHING. but as for the other workers who brought our kabobs and prepared our meals they were extremely kind and talkative (we love) they were great. Oh and the food was good lol.."}
{"text":"A haven of peace and sanity in a world of madness. I almost forgot the topless woman or the guy walking on glass to make a buck outside. The staff are polite and professional, and the pricing is reasonable. A quiet atmosphere to escape the drunk and disorderly as well as the smell of cigarettes outside."}
