{"text":"Update: The Schnitzel. (Period). Best schnitzel in a 15km radius that I'm aware of. Golden, flakey, crispy, dense meat on the inside like it should be, yet soft and easy to cut. Meat not fatty and breading not oily. A+"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the price is on point. Since I discovered this place (Jan. 08/15) I have been here 4 times in 2 weeks. Each time I ate here I have payed $10 or less for my lunch.

Salads: Quinoa is my favourite to order because of the freshness that pops out in it (They put pomegranate seeds and tangerine slices in the salad along with yams and greens). The combination salad lets you pick any combo out of their 4 salads for $9.05 (tax included in that price). It's a filling box which I was surprised about because the other salad joints around this area aren't as big for this price.

Sandwich: I have only tried their mushroom grilled cheese which was very delicious. Why you ask? Because it tastes like butter :P and they use a pumpkin seed bun or something so the bread alone is so good to eat. The sandwich comes with a side green salad but you can upgrade it to any of their other salads for an additional $2.50 I believe.

Soup: I had their butternut squash and potato leak soups. They are warm and filling for a winter day :) Get their soup and salad combo for $6.50 (with tax it's only $7.35) because it's an excellent portion for the price.

Atmosphere: It's a very quaint dining experience. They optimized their small dining area very well with bar seats and small tables that are just big enough for 2 people to share each. In the back wall you can see they grow their own ingredients as well. Super cute!

Tips: It gets really busy once 12:10pm hits for the lunch rush. You can order via Ritual and just pick up your order. At the moment, ritual is having a promo that every second visit to one place you will receive 20% off."}
{"text":"Really love this place! Their menu clearly indicated what's vegetarian and gluten free (GF) with educated staff to back it up. They have a great salad selection that is seasoned well (no cop outs). 

Two out of three salads for the combo the other day were gluten free. Generous portions (not too too much, but not too small), good and healthy ingredients and choice for veggies and GF. Simple recipes (don't put too much, which I like). 

The seating is a little strange, it's tiny with seating, but good if you are alone or with one other person. 

Continue to keep coming!"}
{"text":"Ok walked in out of a cold winters storm to some of the most fantastic food and welcoming gem of a restaurant ! 
Wanted a light lunch at 11:00 and was pleased to see Bunas Kitchen was open . 
Ordered a perfectly spiced Sweet Potato soup . Not the usual \"cream of cornstarch \" that so many places make . A perfectly smooth , yet toothsome soup . The house cured Salmon sandwich was nothing short of Fantastic ! The salmon being the star and the bread and fillings complimenting the fish . I would order the fish on its own , it's that delicious . 
Very much look forward to returning again and again . Oh yes,  really appreciated the music level being not to loud ."}
{"text":"Comfy duck was amazing! Its special Mayo sauce goes really well with juicy duck and egg.

Soup was really like something your grandma would get you for lunch or breakfast.

Very friendly staff, awesome atmosphere, my new most fav lunch place. :)

Everything is clean and neat, checkout their herb garden on the wall."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've tried almost everything on their menu and nothing has disappointed. Such friendly staff and beautiful decor. 
Best quinoa salad I've ever had. 

Definitely a must try to check out for a mid-day/ late afternoon bite."}
{"text":"Tried their comfy duck sandwich and it was amazing! Their salads are always fresh and pasta is home made. Their portions are just right and will be going back for lunch again!"}
{"text":"Meh. Honestly it's not that what I had wasn't good, in fact it was but it really was 'meh'. It being my first time, the guy at the counter was VERY helpful and I decided on the potato-asparagus 'salad' which came over greens with a light vinaigrette. 

First, stop doing that ^. My potato salad did not taste good on top of another. It was weird. The potato salad was extremely heavy. So much so that I had about 5 bites and could not eat anything more. My fault though, I should have gotten a protein to break up the potato but I didn't see that they offered that option.

Second, offer that option. A salad+a protein. Not a salad +a salad, it's just too much starch and carbs, since they're salads are hardly light. 

I will probably go back to try other stuff but I'm in no hurry"}
{"text":"Looking for ingredients that are fresh and a menu that's consistently innovative? 

I think Buna's will become your go-to lunch spot, if the above are qualities you value in what you put in your stomach! Just today, I tried out their new summer menu - the refreshing watermelon salad tossed with cucumber, feta cheese, fresh mint and lime juice. The new pesto salad is an interesting mix of crisp green beans and raw zucchini, dressed in arugula pesto, parmesan cheese, and toasted walnuts. Trust me, you can taste how fresh the ingredients are with each bite. 

You can find a fine balance between 'healthy' and 'indulgence' here - the Comfy Duck Sandwich and Duck Poutine makes it a massive cheat meal, whereas the light salad selection convinces my stomach into thinking I\"m on a healthy diet. 

I recently downloaded the Ritual app, which helps me skip the line-up. I order on my phone and conveniently pick up my order without waiting. The line-up during the lunch rush can be massive, so I suggest ordering ahead! 

Buna's has an excellent tea selection, and now that the summer is here, their hand-made lemonade is one of my favorites! 

They offer 15% off everything between 5pm to 7pm, while supplies last, so this could be a good option to grab dinner on your way home after work!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend for a casual lunch spot at very reasonable pricing.

Where ~$10 might get you a crappy burger combo at a fast food joint, the same amount gives you access to real food options: duck confit poutine, goulash, cassoulet, shaved beet salad...the list goes on, and goes beyond plain old sandwiches.

Yet, even sandwiches receive the gourmet treatment: grilled cheese is a pesto-grilled cheese with mixed cheeses including mozzarella and fontina and walnuts; there's a Duck \"Comfy\" (confit) option; and the typical smoked salmon option is actually house-cured.

Though my mom complained that the salmon and *fries (*stolen from my Duck Comfy poutine, topped with a perfectly runny egg yolk) were too salty, I thought they were regular-level salty.

Place is also pretty nice to sit in for a quick lunch.  There are roughly 8 Aerogardens sitting on a wall growing herbs and various lettuce greens, and the tiny single-person tables, plush seats, and chalkboard menu only add to the charm of Buna's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Recently visited Buna's Kitchen during their soft launch and was overall very happy with my meal. I ordered the salad combination bowl, which consisted of 3 salads (arugula, quinoa with squash and roasted potatoes with green beans). All 3 were very tasty. The menu seems to have some really interesting sandwiches that I will definitely try next time. Would highly recommend this place if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic lunch spot. Not only that, but the food is great and the daily specials keep it interesting and give me more than enough reason to keep going.

My favourites would have to be the \"Comfy\" duck sandwich and the pasta pesto salad. Also the soup salad combo is such a great value. 

Definitely one my favourite places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"- rumors are true. the duck comfy sandwich is delicious. straight up.
- although a little pricey... with the basic salad combo, my meal was about $17 all in... and i was still hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. The combination salad at under none dollars is such a great value considering how much ingredients are in it!
It's a nice place to sit in although there aren't too many tables. The services is quick and they change up the menu based on the season."}
{"text":"Let's talk about quiche. I was recommended their quiche by several adamant colleagues and it didn't disappoint. It was fresh and tasty and felt like it was made with simple and quality ingredients. Flaky pasty, fluffy eggs. They're so good that apparently you have to order by noon or they run out."}
{"text":"We both had the combo salad bowls and loved them. Variety of tastes and fresh ingredients makes eating healthy taste great. Friendly staff and real Dishes and flatware (not plastic) at fast food prices."}
{"text":"I returned several times since my original visit and feel that I may have been too harsh. Yes, the slick, superficial concept rubbed me the wrong way, but the food is wholesome and comforting on a stressful day at the office. Prices are neither cheap nor exorbitant. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"I ordered a schnitzel with fries through Ritual for pick-up during lunch. It was quick and delicious!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, albeit a bit pricey for what it is (lunch counter, takeout). Nice variety too. Highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great selection and they change their menu quite often. Duck confit is a must try though."}
{"text":"I just had a great veggie stew type dish here. Fresh ingredients, perfectly seasoned and made when you order. Nice staff. I would have given it 5 stars but there is limited seating. Very reasonable price point as well.

I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Excellent find.   Great stop for tasty, yet non typical salad & sandwich.   Fresh food."}
{"text":"This place does nice sandwiches for lunch.  But my HUGE complaint about it is the BIG  prices they charge for SMALL sandwiches - for what you get, which are small portions, you pay alot.  I'm OK with paying 10+ for a sandwich as long as it's big, or at least there are some subtantial sides to it.  I wasn't exactly feeling it was value for money from ordering the duck sandwich and a buttersquash soup ($15+ later ...).

Buna's is just too pricey for a quick take out lunch.  Too pricey for me to want to do lunch here regularly.

Ignoring the high prices, the food is great.  A welcome addition to Toronto's entertainment district area.  There aren't that many good places for a quick lunch to go in this area.

If the prices were half what they currently charge, I have no doubt this place would be a smash hit.  Alas, commercial rents in this area I suspect are high..."}
{"text":"When you upgrade the salad, what you really get is a whole lot of lettuce with a few fancy toppings. Over priced. The service from the main guy during lunch is great."}
{"text":"Hello, 

Just here to share my love for Buna's again. This place is absolutely perfect if you want a meal that is healthy, fresh AND tasty. (Healthy and tasteless do not have to be synonymous!)

Again, as mentioned in my previous review, the combination salad is the best bang for your buck (around $9 for a huge box of salads that you can mix and match). AND best of all? They NEVER skimp out on portions - always filling everything right to the brim. 

LUV U BUNA'S!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurant I had in the area. So glad I found them. They have different menu seasonally, can't wait to try the Fall menu."}
{"text":"We had some time to kill before a movie, so we thought we'd stop into Buna's Kitchen for a quick lunch.

We arrived right as they opened at 11:00 and both ordered the same thing: the \"Comfy\" Duck Sandwich. This contains a heaping helping of duck-leg confit, an orange-cranberry aioli, and topped with a fried egg.

It's certainly an attractive looking sandwich. It arrived open-faced and loaded with meat. One bite, however, and it quickly became apparent that it doesn't taste quite as good as it looks.

The bread was fine, but the duck was dry and unimpressive. I suspect it had been sitting around since the day prior, since it was barely room temperature and was completely lacking in freshness or juiciness. And although there is a small serving of the aforementioned aioli, this is one incredibly dry sandwich. The fried egg placed atop the sandwich was overdone, which meant that there was no yolk to give the whole thing a much-needed saucing.

The plate also contained a rather large helping of salad, and this turned out to be the highlight -- as the vinaigrette dressing used was actually really delicious. But I paid $12 for this plate; I expect the sandwich to be far better than the salad if that's the case."}
{"text":"Despite the other reviews here the prices are average or below what you find in the area. You get a quiche and salad for 6$ or if you wanna try their specialty you can schnitzel and salad less than $10.

It's conveniently located right next to my work place! It's my number one to go to place for a healthy lunch. 

What I love is that I never get bored of the options! The menu changes seasonally, the soup, salad and dessert changes daily. 

Be sure to ask for ketchup, hot sauce, etc as they keep it hidden in the fridge."}
{"text":"This new lunch spot may has potential but also has some kinks to work out. Daily specials including (most of the time) a vegetarian pasta dish, a mix and mash salad bar of gourmet style salads, sandwiches and today even, a zucchini donut dessert?! and plenty more to chose from...

I've been three times now - managed to get food two out of the three times. My major complaint is that they run out of items all the time and well before I consider lunch time to be over - say by 1:30pm! I'm a big proponent of not wasting food at the end of a day but come on, 1:30pm and you're out of 2 of the salads in the only 4 selection salad bar? I'm glad business is good but then reward your returning (late-lunching) customers!

But more importantly, the food. The aforementioned salads are the highlight for me. A roast potato and thinly sliced veggies in a sweet-ish dressing is mouth-wateringly delicious. The panzanella was pretty good - big home made croutons with boccincini, tomatoes and black olives. The pasta salad was delicious and not too greasy as I find a lot of pasta salads, the quinoa was well cooked and dressed as well. Served on a bed of fresh micro greens and a bit more balsamic dressing makes this a great side to accompany a soup or sandwich. And I got two salads on a bed of greens for $6! 

Now for the \"needs improvement\" items. My bgf (bestgirlfriend) and I tried the Buna's favourite grilled cheese which is brie and pear and were very disappointed. The bread was a bit singed and too crispy, the cheese was not melted and the pear not very sweet. Bit of a fail. Not sure I'd order that again. Today my bgf ordered the pulled pork with mixed reviews: the pulled pork was bland - the right amount of sauce, good coleslaw, nice bun but if the pork is the main ingredient, it shouldn't be bland. 

So the jury is still out for me on this one - haven't tried the pasta and would give something else a try but the salads have me coming back for more either way."}
{"text":"Buna's recently catered a lunch meeting for 10 people for me, food was awesome, portions generous and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I went for lunch to Buna's today and it was such a cute little spot to grab something quickly. I ordered the quiche (leek and cheddar) with a side of mixed greens and potato/asparagus salad. It was packed up quickly and I was out of there within five minutes.
The salads were dressed deliciously and tasted a bit sweet. The quiche was soft with a perfect amount of crust. The portions sizes were large and lasted me into the mid-afternoon. 
Overall, a really great lunch experience in the midst of a blizzard and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"You may have read this already, but here it is again: the duck and egg sandwich is excellent! It is super-tasty and rich and just so damn fantastic. Downside for me - salad portion is small, particularly the mixed greens that comes with all sandwiches and even the extra side I ordered was not much more but still very good (it was a roasted potato with shaved carrots and dill). 

The location is small but there are a few tables. It's a I great option for a more gourmet lunch or takeaway."}
{"text":"This place is across from my temporary office for 2 weeks here in TO and there were great reviews so I went in here pretty hungry, looking for a healthy but hearty option.

Ordered a salad and added chicken but they got my order wrong and I ended up getting a chicken sandwich with a side of salad. I didn't have much time so I ended up taking it anyway.

Salad: fresh kale salad with edamame and a light balsamic vinaigrette dressing. No option to have dressing on the side since salad's already made and tossed, but it wasn't too heavy which was nice. 

Sandwich: Wasn't planning on eating this so it was a surprise meal but it was warm and toasted, and the melted Brie with the chicken and cranberry sauce(or some sort of fruity sauce) was a good combination with arugula. 

Even though it wasn't what I was planning on eating, I still had a decent quick meal. Nothing impressive like the other reviews but I'd come back if I was just needing another quick meal in between work."}
{"text":"The quiche & kale salad are excellent as everyone says but I have a complaint. Can anyone tell me WHY during the lunch rush downtown that they only make a very limited amount of the kale salad and quiche? I get it that they want to sell other items but the quiche is the feature and a main reason people go there for lunch because of the price but by 12:30pm you shouldn't be sold out. So for that reason, I'm out."}
{"text":"Great cold weather food and fresh ingredients. strong vegetarian options as well.  

Had the vegetarian goulash and it was amazing and I'm not usually a fan of vegan only meals.  

Also the butter tarts are probably the best I've ever had and that says a lot since I've probably had 5000 butter tarts in my life."}
{"text":"A fast and affordable office lunch fav with seasonal menus. The staff are always really friendly and efficient, and the interiors are bright and clean. I really like their Soup and Salad Combo, which allows you to pick from daily soups and 4 salads for $6.50. They really stuff as much as they can into the containers and the dishes themselves have fresh, interesting ingredients - they are not cop-outs! I do find the seasoning a bit strong sometimes and some people may not be full from it, but it works well for a light lunch. Tip: you can choose more than one salad if you want to sample different ones.

Their Comfy Duck Poutine is also glorious. Think poutine with a generous portion of duck meat and a fried egg on top. Do not eat if you need to be productive!

They are best for takeout as there is limited seating, but it's alright if you're in a small group and you don't mind the open kitchen"}
{"text":"Buna's Kitchen is a solid lunch option for those living and working in the entertainment district. The service is quick and the options are affordable. Sandwiches, salads, and soups are the focus of the menu, with a variety of mains and sides that can be upgraded.

For a relatively small space, there is seating for up to 15 guests which are arranged comfortably. If you're planning to grab and go, the ordering system is pretty straightforward. There's a nice view of Richmond Street along the south-facing windows. It's a comfortable place to eat with a food selection that invites you to try it more than once, for sure.

Must-try items:
Pulled Beef Brisket Sandwich
Mixed Greens (or any salad)

All sandwiches come with a free side of mixed greens, which make for a tasty, healthy meal. The brisket tastes well cooked and flavourful, and also comes as a poutine if you'd like. Pretty much everything looks appetizing. Daily specials offer additional choices, as something new is added to the menu every week."}
{"text":"Giant hearty salads that chase the winter blues away? Yes please. I am at this sit-down or take-out joint at least once a week. Its great for when you've been sitting at your desk too long and are starving and could easily demolish a big cheese-covered sandwich and fries but you know that will make you feel like garbage, and what you really need is a bunch of veggies but oh god you're starving. 

I have been pretty loyal to the sweet potato and chickpea salad here. I swear like half a can of chick peas and a full sweet potato are piled onto a bed of greens. So much good plant-based protein and vitamins! Add in some light dressing, a decent sprinkling of salty goat cheese, and a nice kick c/o some cayenne, and I go back to work feeling full but ready to take on the rest of the day, not ready to nap under my desk. 

When I'm feeling less ravenous I go for the small salad and soup combo. Its a steal at like $7+ tax. Buna's also offers your serious comfort food classics like Poutine and fried chicken and seem to be popular for them as well. I'm sticking to my salad for now, but I'm sure one day I'll break ;)"}
{"text":"Best fries I've had in a while! Thick fresh-cut potatoes that are somehow perfectly crispy on the outside! I got the mix of four salads and enjoyed them all. Also, quite large portions making it good value. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What I like to order: combination salad ($8 + tax)
What I don't like that much: fries (too oily), duck stuff (too expensive and small portion)

I ordered a lot from here for lunch because it is close to my work place. I usually order the combination salad, which is about $8. It is good quality and fresh salad. In my opinion better value than Freshii and Kupfert and Kim.
For around $8, you got a big box of salad which filled me up. Highly recommend!
I tried soup, fries, and duck sandwich, not as worthy and as good as salad here.
Also, I ordered using Ritual app, this store has Ritual rewards."}
