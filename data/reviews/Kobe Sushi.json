{"text":"This place is now called Pad Thai Sushi Buffet. Worst restaurant I have been to in my life.  Went there tonight with two friends. Not only was the waiter impolite asshole, he tried to SCAM me off my money as well.  When we first went in there was only one pencil in the table to write on the order menu and my friend wanted a pencil as well. She asked the waiter for a pencil and his reply was completely rude.  Friend A: Excuse me, can I get a pencil? Server: Only 1 pencil for table. No pencil Me: Okay from your teppanyaki menu how many pieces are there? Server: it's in the picture Me: the picture has a guy in front of a grill with smoke coming out Him: Yeah, that's in the picture. Look at it  Seriously WTF! Are you kidding me?...So we finally we ordered the food and he came back to the table.  Server: We don't have any satay Me: okay then can we order something else instead? We'll have the basil chicken wing instead. Server: you can only order 1 piece  Me: There's 3 of us, you want us to share 1 piece of wing between us?  We were there for about 30-40 mins. This guy circled our table about 20 times, literally every 2 mins. It's good when serves come to the table and check how we're doing but you shouldn't hang around us like a vulture. Finally we were done and my friend wanted ice cream really bad which was the only thing in their dessert menu.  Friend B: can we order ice cream? Server: no ice cream. We don't have any ice cream.   Mind you that's the only thing in their dessert menu and they don't have it.  Me: okay then, can we get 3 separate bills?  So he brings our bill mine and Friend A's bill is $24.85 and Friend B is $26.45. Then we're all debating whether we should tip him or not and Friend A decides to just even it out and tip him $27 in cash and left it at the table. Friend A and I walk over to the front to pay by debit. Friend A pays $26.85 and I am still waiting to pay.   At this point both my friends decide to walk out while I am taking my card out of the wallet. The server walks back to our table and brings back the money my friend left in cash at the table. Then he starts talking to the other staff in either Korean or Japanese and he takes my card and hands back the interac machine. The machine prompts me to chose Chq or Save account and I am thinking in my head \"why there is no option for me to tip?\". I actually felt bad and was going to tip him. I put my pin in and it says \"Approved 27.85\".   This fucking asshole put in $3 tip for himself and handed the machine back to me.  Me: Why does it say 27.85? My total was 24.85 Him: because that's.... that's t-t-tax, I mean tip Me: Don't I get to choose how much I tip you? Him: No it's automatic in the machine.  Me: my friend chose how much she gets to tip you, why can't I?  I go out and call my friends back in.  Friend A: I chose how much I tipped you Server: You paid by credit, your friend is paying by debit. It's different Me: No it's not Server: Well your friend paid $27 and tipped me only 50 cents Friend B: So? I didn't like your service. I can tip you whatever I want Me: Yeah I get to choose how much I tip you. How dare you try to steal money? Him: okay here's your $3. Don't come back here again Me: FUCK YOU PIECE OF SHIT! I'll make sure no one ever comes back and I will make sure you get in trouble  Anyways, I will be calling in tomorrow and speaking to the manager. I don't know how much that will help but this asshole needs to get fired.  Aside from that, the food sucked. I've been to almost every sushi place in Mississauga. The sushi tasted awful and you could taste the ice from the fish meat, that's how badly frozen it was. There are plenty more to comment about how disgusting their food was but I will leave it at that."}
{"text":"So I've only been here before the renovations and have not had a chance to return but based on my experiences before the old owners were extremely friendly, the staff was really nice and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family, but reading these reviews it sounds like the new owners are not as nice"}
{"text":"This place JUST went under some renovations and looks UBER cool now.   I don't know how I feel about this. Don't get me wrong, it looks gorgeous..but I came here to support the local biz owners. Oh well, I suppose such is the world of BIDness. I don't even see the same staff.  The cashier wasn't as personable and when I went to talk to the chef, he sort of ushered me to go away. This hurt my feelings. Perhaps he wasn't into mindless chit chat. The old owners would've said hello and chatted with me , while I was waiting for my food. Mean!   Dark purple walls with lots of dark wood booths and Ikea paper lamps.    Take out: California roll and shrimp soup = $13.00 The maki was fresh, packed in a cute see through container and the shrimp soup was surprisingly delicious. The container is very generous and at first it looks like tomato soup with blotches of oil chilling on the top...but it really hits the spot, if you feel like soup.   xoxo M."}
