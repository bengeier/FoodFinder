{"text":"Found this little gem when visiting the gorgeous Christmas market in Old Longueuil. I love churros and rarely come across places that have them (especially in the South Shore). Chichis looked so warm and inviting from the outside so we were completely drawn in. 
It seems to be a family run business by a couple (I think) who have been running a churros business since their home time. We ordered the signature 'chichis' of course, which are regular churros sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. I have tried many churros in various countries in my life but these have got to be the best ones I have ever had. They were long and crispy with soft interior, just how I like them. I had them with chocolate dipping sauce which certainly was the cherry on the top!
The lady owner is super friendly and let us sit in despite us ordering a couple of churros only (we had just eaten but wanted to try). The interior is bright and clean, great for meeting friends for coffee. I can't wait to return and try the churros filled with chocolate alongside a coffee! Their coffees and hot chocolates also looked amazing so definitely worth stopping by if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Les crêpes sont excellentes et churros sont terriblement bon j'ai fait Montréal Longueuil pour aller y goûter. Et je crois y retourner bientôt."}
{"text":"Will not be ordering from here again.  We had our order delivered by Uber.

My cappuccino was only a third full and did not have any caramel flavoring.

The poutine we ordered had almost no whipped cream whatsoever and the pastry seemed stale.

The only thing that actually arrived as advertised was the churro."}
{"text":"I have been craving for churros for a few years now after I came back from Mexico. 

Last week when I came back from another trip I started to bookmark a few places nearby that had Churros and I just happened to be nearby South Shore to study so I stop at this café.

There is free parking on the street although it's a maximum of two hours. I found a spot right in front of the café!! The place looks clean and it's probably an apartment That they have renovated into this café/ restaurant.

There was one other group sitting near us and that was it. My friend and I decided to share 6 churros with the salty Caramel dip, and we had a hot chocolate and a decaf latte.

Must I say, the chichi that they call were amazing! We said yes to add on cinnamon : they were hot, crispy and sweet !! The drinks were ok, i cant complain. After about 15 to 20 minutes sitting there though we started to feel like there was no heating really. After 30 to 40 minutes, my feet were frozen even though I was wearing winter boots and I was pretty much convinced them that they were trying to save on the heat. I cannot work very well in that environment on my laptop and we decided to leave earlier than we were supposed to. This is why they do not get 5 stars, though if ur just there for the churros and a 15 min talk to your friend this place will do it."}
{"text":"A great destination after nice a walk in the old Longueuil, our a great destination after having a heavy in any of the restaurants nearby or a great destination to go chat with friends or like in our case a great destination after the xmas market ! We finally found authentic churros ! They actually tasted better than the ones we had in Mexico ! The variety of sauces make the choice very hard but any choice you make, you wont regret at all ! Great service great business and will definately visit again ! The interior is very bright and minimal and at the same time very clean !"}
