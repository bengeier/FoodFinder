{"text":"Food was good.  Prices were less than Jen's across the street and the meat portions were bigger.  We got 2 salad rolls and 2 orders of B6, beef, pork, chicken, and spingroll, with veggies.  Paid $35 after tip and left full!  Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times now and have been impressed with the service, food and prices.  Granted, though, I've only tried the grilled pork vermicelli bowl (2X) and the vegetarian spring roll vermicelli bowl.  One nice feature, for us anyway, is that the fish sauce doesn't leave a fishy aftertaste or come up in burps later (okay, maybe a bit too much information but it is a problem that we've encountered at several other places). Decor is superior to the other Vietnamese restaurants in town.  Update:  I've been there several times and this place never has tapioca balls for bubble tea. How can it be bubble tea with no bubbles?  Food is consistently good but you need to go elsewhere for bubble tea."}
{"text":"My wife & I get take out from Thang Long and it is one of the friendliest places in Airdrie. The staff is always very friendly, helpful and very appreciative that you support them. I have had Vietnamese food from many different places in both Airdrie & Calgary and I would recommend Thang Long to anyone looking for good food at a very fair price."}
{"text":"My family had a great experience here. The staff were helpful to our questions and the food was excellent. Great flavour."}
{"text":"My buddy and I walked over for supper one Friday night. The place was busy. I think there was only one table open. My friend ordered the crispy shrimp wontons. They were very strange looking, almost like orangish crispy critters. They tasted shrimpy but inside it was like shrimp mush, not actual shrimp. Made me a bit hesitant to eat another.   We both had lemongrass chicken which we both enjoyed. That was until my friend found some bits of a paper wrapper on her spring roll. No she did not ask for extra fiber! The waitress didn't charge her for her vermicelli which was good.   The atmosphere was pleasant and the place looked clean. Service could have been a bit more attentive but it was quite busy."}
{"text":"Wow. Love this place. It has the best Vietnamese food I have had in a while. And in Airdrie no less.   Friendly staff. Great food. Great value. Need I say more."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food but find that the choices in Airdrie leave me wanting.   Than Long is my go to place in town.  I usually order a B4 ( shrimp skewers) I love that there are lots of fresh veggies and it is high quality produce not just a few pieces of iceberg lettuce and some sprouts.   I branched out to the soup recently and loved that too.  I highly recommend them and I order in at least 1-2 week on my own. I also convince my husband to order on  the weekend too...   I'm hooked :)"}
{"text":"Located in the strip-mall by the Library, Scotia Bank, & Panago Pizza this restaurant used to be an Itailan place. I was very saddened when I saw the Itailain place had closed (and if you were also a fan of Sal's - don't be sad! He opened a pizza place over on the east side of airdrie called \"Il Forno\"). When I saw a Vietnamese place had openened I decided to give it a try.   In my opinon, the vietnamese food in airdrie is \"so-so\". It's not the callibre you'd get in Calgary, especially in China Town.  So I figured it couldn't hurt to try this place, but I certainly didn't have any good expectations.   My friend and I went in and were seated and given menus. We perused the menu and decided on our orders. I thought it was neat that I could order chicken or beef salad rolls! That's different. I had the beef salad rolls and a bowl with meat (I think beef, that's what I normally get) and spring rolls. It was DELICIOUS. All the food was very fresh,and flavorful.   I now go there regularly (At least once a week, sometimes twice), but I go for the soup. Their soup is AMAZING. My friend got me hooked on it. Her and I are certain there's some kind of drugs in the broth to make it so addictive. :)   I usually get the Chicken or the Beef Satay soup. It's just spicy enough to be super-flavorful but not spicy enough to burn your face off. The veggies are really good, and the noodles are never over-cooked.   I highly recommend this place if you like Vietnamese food. Or if you've never tried it and this will be your first time, Go here! Not one of the other places in Airdrie."}
{"text":"Wow, finally a Vietnamese restaurant in Airdrie that does it right. You can count on your left hand the number of Vietnamese restaurants in our fair city and this one IMHO is hands-down the best.   We finally had the chance to give Thang Long a try for dinner mid week and really enjoyed the overall experience. We were seated promptly in what looked like a space that could seat 40 diners. There were only a few tables already enjoying their dinner so our hostess promptly took our order for drinks and dinner, the little one enjoyed watching the fish tank and we watched the Vietnamese karaoke on theTV in the corner, classic!  You know you are about to enjoy a great Pho when the bean sprouts, basil, and lime arrive and the vegetables on the plate are crisp and fresh. The spring rolls were very good, the Pho was tasty, and M reported the grilled pork vermicelli bowl on par with her favourites.  Appy, adult drinks, and dinners, for two adults + one small eater at $40 felt very reasonable, and a very friendly conversation as we paid the bill, we will be back.  Overall one of the better dining experiences to in Airdrie. If you are a fan of Vietnamese food, give this place a try for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good food! I have submitted our pictures of what we ate last evening, and the cleanliness of this restaurant and service were outstanding. Would definitely be back, would DEFINITELY recommend to others."}
{"text":"I found the previous reviews to be extremely misleading and disappointing.  I came here based on the stellar reviews and left miserably hungry and sad. Although the service is friendly and attentive, I'm giving it two stars. The food just flat out sucks.   I got the beef noodle soup, which is my usual at any Vietnamese restaurant. The broth SHOULD be clear but flavorful, rich with hot beefy notes. Thin sliced beef, a little pink so you can let it cook in the hot broth under a heap of long silky rice noodles.   Well. We got none of those. The broth was suspiciously diluted (were they even trying?) and the noodle/beef portion was fit for a small child. $11 is absurdly expensive for such a ridiculously bland dish. The spring rolls were rolled so thin it was comparable to a sharpie marker. The 4 rolls we got wasn't enough for the two of us, let alone just one.  I also don't believe that residents of Airdrie have to live with mediocre food or lower their standards because \"it's not Calgary.\" For gods sake, it's a 20 minute drive, it's not like restaurants have different water or shortage of anything Calgary has.  I am deeming this restaurant unacceptable. Case closed."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars is pretty accurate.  The beef sate pho and the fresh chicken spring rolls were good! Better than a few other places I've tried in Airdrie. I thought the broth was flavorful and everything seemed fresh.  I wouldn't say it was mind blowing or overly unique, but I will definitely eat here again."}
