{"text":"Gabrielle and Huriel work their ass off to make you feel right at home amongst friends. But don't let the staff contagious good-heartedness, their eccentric crafty decor or disco/hip-hop infused playlists fool you, the REAL STAR is their inventive, fragrant menu offering. From the zesty kimchi Bloody ceasar to their crisp pork shoulder green curry served with tons of fresh herbs, there's something for every pallet - whether you're vegan or meat lover, looking for generous comfort food or a good spice kick!  P.S: Yelp doesn't want to change the tag set, but Bighi is a multi-ethinic curry restaurant (mostly Japanese, Indian and Thai)."}
{"text":"Finally an inventive, new restaurant in town! After a series of me-too openings, I was starting to feel a little bummed about the Montréal resto scene. Then came along Bighi Curry, and my fate was restored!  I've come for brunch and dinner, and both times was very impressed. The staff was very helpful and genuinely nice. The decor, eclectic and fun, a perfect fit for this area of town. The music also hit the right notes, with some  old school hip hop.   Now for the food. I love the concept of the menu revolving around one theme: curry. Rather than limit themselves to a particular cuisine, they chose instead to make curry the star of their menu. From Japanese, to Indian and Thai, all kinds of curry inspired dishes are found on the menu. Their brunch was very inventive (yay for options other than bacon and eggs!) and their dinner catered for vegetarians as well as meat lovers, with amazing variations on classic dishes.   This place totally rocks whether you're going out with friends or looking for a family friendly spot (in fact my husband and I came here with our newborn and had a great time).   The only downside is it can be a little slow, so just make sure you are not in a huge rush and enjoy this unique little gem!"}
{"text":"Located on the other side of the island, it literally felt like I was in a different part of town. I recognized the entrance from the large handpainted Buddha. The decor had a homely café feel to it with a touch of wacky street art graffiti. The odd combination of vintage dining sets scattered alongside a traditional bar and chalkboard & duotang menus was fun. The bathroom was random too - it had diapers for babies!   I was drawn to this venue because of its diversity in Asian cuisine- Thai, Indian, Japanese, you name it. The chefs were super personable and told us about how they've been opened for a few months. Menu changes every few weeks- brunch is also popular here!  I feel like I can't comment on the traditional menu because we came here for a family get together (ie Vegan and non pork eaters) so the chefs agreed to make us a custom menu for 22$ /person including 3 appetizers and 3 entrées (vegan versions of the same dishes).   Appetizers: 1. Vegan Ceviché styled salad (assortment of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions) topped on giant vermicelli rice cake/chip. Cool combo. 2.mango salad topped with fish sauce heavy on the cilantro (loved it!) 3.a brochette of chicken tikka masala in a light yogurt sauce (3 pieces - well marinated and tender) vs a brochette of pickled onions!  Entrées:(most spicy) 1. Fish- mackeral curry (great for seafood lovers) 2. Pistachio puré curry -so different! My favourite of all. 3. Daal soup  Served with a twist on a traditional biryani.  My folks are hard critics- but they loved everything with plenty of leftovers to take home!"}
{"text":"I am not quite sure what the hype is about for this restaurant. We went last night and we ordered 3 entrees and 3 main meals.  Entree 1: Cucumber and chips. It was good but way too spicy. Very simple Entree 2: Chicken Tikka, this was probably the best dish of the night. Chicken was very tender and good seasoning Entree 3 : mango and onion salad. Very simple, something about the dressing was off. Main 1: Shrimp curry: This was by far the WORST dish of the night. The pepper and tamarind sauce was way too sour and completely off. There were 4 shrimps in an overload of onions. The white rice was hard. Just awful. Main 2: Pistachio Biriani. This was good but the Naan bread that came with it was practically raw. The rice on the side with the vegetables was the 2nd best part of the meal but still nothing great. Main 3: Duck curry dish. The duck was very nice good but the sauce around it was completely off which made the dish very disappointing.  The decoration of the place really has some charm and I had very high hopes for this place. Sadly, it was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"This is a really hip place in the east side of Montréal. Dishes are really good! We were surprised to find new flavours in classical dishes (like an omelette) that actually worked! Decoration, music, service, etc. Everything was on point. Looking forward to bringing more friends with me."}

{"text":"I have been here twice now and the experiences have varied both times.  The restaurant itself is eclectic. I like the vibe and energy of the staff and the way things work. It's pefect for a chill evening with friends or a date night w ur loved one. Although I would advise against having your first date here as it might be hard to hear each other at some point and/or the food is a bit on the heavy side  The first time I was with a friend on a friday night & we sat at the bar. We had quite an emotional meeting and the owner/bartender was very nice and sweet. She would leave us a big stack of napkins because we were crying at one point and the offered us shots. We chitchat back and and forth with her and the other waitress and they were both very entertaining.  That time we took the chicken skewers, the mackerel white curry and the shrimp coconut curry. Delicious! By the end of the night the staff even broke out into a full-on karaoke sess with their beautiful voices.  Last week we came back, this time we were 5 so I suggested we take one of each item on the menu and share which came up to 5 appies and 5 mains (we all kinda rolled home afterwards)  The food this time however, since we took everything on the menu (except a sandwich) we were able to see how not all of the items seem to belong on the menu woth the others. Personally, I think they all had potential and I had my favs but some were just not as impressive as the rest  So first, the appies:  -The chicken skewers are consistently good.  -vermicelli salad, good! But it seemed lonely in that menu for some reason... -pickled mackerel was good but didnt taste pickled. -coconut ceviche, good but there was nothing \"ceviche\" about it unfortunately -shiitake temaki was good, but again, it disnt seem to fit in w anything else.... Now the mains: -I really liked the red Thai duck curry. The duck was well cooked and seasoned along w the rest of the dish itself.  -also really likes the Burmese egg noodles. The different flavors were nice. -the Udon Japanese curry w/ potato caught us off guard with the color. But once we dug in, literally, it got better but we still weren't sure of the potato mousse being there... -lemon shimps with red lentil dahl was ok, nothing special compared to the others -coco curry w/ raisins was too sweet for our taste and so it was forgetable.  We also had the Bloody Kim drink andot was quite interesting with the kimchi in it.  Over all I would definitely recommend this place as I myself would still come back to see how far the chef will bring the menu"}
{"text":"Review is based on our experience on a Friday evening -- not applicable for lunch. I had high expectations for a restaurant rated almost perfectly.   (0/1): Food Let's start with the food (refer to the photo below). The Malaysian yellow curry tasted South East Asian alright, but uni-dimensional. The duck was very tough and some parts were not chewable.   The Mackerel white curry contained 3 small mackerels. It had the most flavours out of the 3 curries we ordered, but still not anything to be excited about.  The Japanese katsu curry tasted like a diluted version of Coco Curry (popular curry chain restaurant). The flavours were most balanced in this curry.   (0/1): Price Curries cost between 12 and 19 if I remember correctly... Which is borderline acceptable for dinner considering it's portion size (refer to photo). A guy like myself would like to be filled a little more.   (0/1): Service There were two waitresses working that night, and about 8 full tables. Our waitress was friendly but took forever to take our order. Then, at some point during dinner, we asked for water and napkins... We waited for a little over 10min before stealing napkins from a nearby tray -- but the water never came...we googled that a human can survive 3 days without water so yeah here I am writing this review #bless.  (1/1): Environment The decor is really nice. I especially like the walls. The chairs and tables aren't cozy but everything else was on point. I'd say the whole decor gives off a very asian fusion kind of impression.  Overall: -1 food, -1 price, -1 service -- for a total of 2/5.  Can someone point out what I overlooked?"}
