{"text":"This new foot court at 1 York looks pretty upscale.  But this taco place is terribly low-end. My fish taco came with a sliver of fish no bigger than my pinky finger. Steak was very tough. Tortillas were hard and unpleasant. Toppings were meh.  Pricier than most lunch options and entirely not worth even normal lunch prices. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Tried this new food court for lunch today.  After waiting in line at the Taco place for almost 25 minutes we were finally able to order. I had the pulled pork tacos and my friend had the fish.  The food was tasty enough, but they really need to pick up the pace.  Waiting 25 mins is not acceptable.  After eating, we then had to line up for an elevator back down as the escalator was under repair.  Overall, not a great first impression"}
{"text":"I'm totally done with this place. I have tried their numerous establishments and they all SUCK.  Poke bowls were bland and lacked flavour.  Sushi was old! Tuna was almost black - should have taken a picture  Beef banh mi - don't even bother if you're used to the standard of Banh mi boys.  Mexican - ULTRA small tacos where the staff makes sure they skimp on toppings. They also use High liner fish for the baha tacos. The grilled veggies were so burnt it tasted .... burnt.  Hot counter (by the entrance) - small portion size plus bad taste.  Will NEVER BE BACK"}
{"text":"Upscale decor and plenty of seating. Nice attempt to create an upscale/hip food court. Attempt is the key word though. Because when it comes to actual food quality, they've pretty much failed. There's nothing special about any of these food establishments and they all charge you a pretty penny for the portion of food. The only one I'll consider going to is the Chef's Table, where the prices are more reasonable and you actually get a decently filling meal out of it. But even then, I can't find anything particularly compelling about the menu there."}
{"text":"Poke bowl wasn't very good and over priced, avocados were still partially frozen(?) and a little chewy. You can get better at the Telus building close by.  Cappuccino, I don't think they know how to use their expensive machine... Maybe the main barista doesn't work after peak hours (after 1 PM)...."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed my lunch meals at Chef's Table and Raw Bar.   Chef's Table lunches are like a nice 'home-cooked' meal and can feel very filling or sparse depending on your choice of base, protein and sides. The lunch meals I have had there I enjoyed.  I tried the Mercatino Bowl and enjoyed it. It's essentially their take on Bibimbap...I thought the portion was good and enjoyed the flavour.  Not sure why there are some many 'hater' reviews."}
{"text":"This place is such a great idea, but it's too bad the execution is terrible. I've now been to frsh grns twice and both times they were out of major menu items. For example, I ordered a cob salad today and they didn't have eggs or avocado. They said they'd add more ingredients to make up for it but didn't(and forgot onions). They may have added an extra cherry tomato but I can't really tell.  Disappointing given the inflated prices, to say the least. There are better options on Bremner (120 bremner with an Olly Frescos about to launch) and the new union station food court will be open soon."}
{"text":"This is the new Food Hall opens in 1 York Building. This location is in along the Toronto downtown PATH system. You take the escalator up and you will find the entrance on the right.   The venue is very spacious and clean. Many seatings for big and small groups. I believe Patio will be open in warmer time. There are various choices of food, salad, Mexican, coffee, sandwiches, etc. It is a basic food court setting and you just line up at each vendor.   Cost of the meal is mainly $9-11; portion and quality is decent and perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Tried the dark roast coffee and an egg and avocado sandwich. I couldn't eat the sandwich, it was so bad. By avocado they mean a tiny amount of pre-made guacamole spread on squares of cheap bread (something like wonder bread). It wasn't properly pressed/toasted, the cheddar cheese square was still cold. It was by far the worst sandwich I ever had, I will not be coming back here."}
