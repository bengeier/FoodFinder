{"text":"Perfect for Tom Yum soup & congee!!! Alot of things are good there!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great since it open, it's been about 20+ years now. The wonton noddles were always authentic hong kong style. It was a favorite place for my family after a weekend trip. We drove by it the other day and saw it was closed and either renovating to be another more northern Chinese style restaurant or was bought."}
{"text":"They're open the latest and trust me, not a lot do in Scarborough. It's a greasy spoon type place but I always find these places to have the best food. This is our late night indulgence."}
{"text":"This place has the best all-shrimp wontons outside of Hong Kong.  I don't eat pork, so it's hard for me to find all-shrimp wontons.  But I've managed to find places in NYC , Philly, SF, and Chicago (all Chinatowns) as well as numerous places in TO to try them.  I love shrimp wonton noodles.

My parents hate this place b/c like another Yelper complained of, it is not the best atmosphere.  The menu & condiments jar are \"sticky\", but frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.  Every time I come back to TO, \"Jin Jin\" (its Chinese name) is the first place I request to eat at.  

I love their beef ho fun (they will separate the beef out as I don't eat beef, great customer service!).  I love their shrimp wonton noodles, best noodles & best wontons.  They are so friggin' cheap.  A meal consisting of like 6 dishes totals $40 after 16% tax (oh Canada, I still love our universal healthcare!).

I like nice restaurants, but this place is so f**king good that it will always be my favorite Cantonese resto in TO.  I don't know if they speak Mandarin; if you don't speak Cantonese, just stick with English to be safe."}
{"text":"Sad to report that this Scarborough institution has gone under. Went last month and it was closed for renovation, with a new sign going up: South Sea Chinese Seafood Restaurant."}
{"text":"Chicken and Noodles Chinese Restaurant has been in Scarborough for over 20 years.

Compare to other chic, nicely decorated restaurant, Chicken and Noodles really reminds me of Chinatown.. or places back in the 80s where disposable plastic covers were used as lining on the tables, people going to Chinese restaurants because the food is cheap and one can expect to be served by waitstaffs that has quite an attitude.

The menu has quite a vast selections of Cantonese/Thai/Malaysian/Japanese inspired dishes... I don't know if that is good or not....Everything here is cheap... comparable to food court prices. Wonton Noodle soup for $3.95 is not easy to find up at a sit down restaurant anymore. A Hanoi Chicken with rice combo that comes with soup and rice for $6.95. Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup for $4.95. 

Mon- Fri they have specials when you order over $25 before tax, you get half of their famous chicken for $1. That for sure a bargain if you are eating with a group.

I ordered the shrimp dumplings noodles soup ($3.95) and chinese broccoli in beef brisket sauce ($3.95). The vegetables arrived first.. such a big portion, I feel full even looking at that.. The noodles though I found the shrimp dumplings are really tasty stuffed with tons of shrimps, however the broth is quite salty... (full of MSG??)

Found here everything is sticky. The outside of the condiments bottles are sticky, the menus are sticky...  The floors are sticky .....OK I am grossed out...

Sorry I won't be back... Please don't ask me to go back!!

Though, the place is fully packed for lunch on Friday with No lunch Specials.

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"I've been here for... quite a number of years. In fact, I still remember the place before they renovated it, which was many, many years ago. I don't know why, but this looks like to be only place I know of that uses thinner noodles to make their chow mein (I've been told they use wonton noodles), and that's seems to be the way I like it."}
