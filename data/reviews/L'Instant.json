{"text":"I got the poutine at L'INSTANT. The worst poutine I've ever had in my entire life. The sauce tasted like bean sauce. The fries had a burnt aftertaste. And there was almost no cheese in it. Just fries and sauce. Just awful.

Someone I was with ordered a hamburger and the meat was raw. Red as can be. Her order was messed up as well (one can have the soup or fries but she got both!) 

Won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"Located in the casino and open 24/7. The portions might seem a bit small for the prices but the quality of food is very high. I always get a poutine here."}
{"text":"If you get hungry whilst at the casino you could stop in here for a wrap, salad, or prepacked sandwich. The cooked meals however leave much to be desired, not to mention the cost. A \"Casino Burger\" (bacon cheeseburger) which comes as a trio only set us back nearly $13 and the meat puck was really on the dry side. 

I'd suggest packing your own snacks or just getting out and heading somewhere nearby."}
