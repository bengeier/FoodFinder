{"text":"Decent price and good options, for Vaughan/ the local area. If you are willing to go a little further, there is better out there.  Service is relatively slow, and there was a long wait between our orders arriving, tables were cleared before more food arrived.  We were also here with a group, and ordered \"larger\" numbers for certain sashimi and rolls, and they made our order smaller. (We ordered 20 shrimp, and only got 12...)"}
{"text":"Tried going on a Sunday for dinner and it was packed so I thought ok I'll come back Monday it must be good to be so packed. Went back today and it was empty, not sure if cause it was slow but the quality of food was below average. The salmon suhimi i ordered was sliced super thin and tasted weird. I've had better sushi from mall kiosks. Service was also quick but again we were the only ones in the place. Won't be returning lots of other options in Vaughn."}
{"text":"Cute little sushi place. Attentive service, food didn't take long to come out, clean environment,  cheap too (we got a 10% discount for no reason). Great service, our waitress was very kind, did little extra things like bringing the ice cream out after the food when we ordered both together."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty. I enjoyed beef teriyaki and shirmp teriyaki. Good service and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Lowkey spot, deserves more attention. Grand opening gets you 15% off all you can eat currently"}
{"text":"Though the food quality is okay, there aren't as many selections as in other restaurant charging the same price."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem of a restaurant as it is walking distance from my house, and wanted to try a different Sushi restaurant. It is a small location, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Less people means quicker service and better quality service!  The owners greeted us and were very pleasant and attentive the entire time we were there. We placed our All-you-can-eat order and they brought it within no time at all, and altogether (instead of item by item like most places). They even brought us some additional rolls for us to try out and see if we liked them. After we were done with sushi we ordered dessert and the waitress suggested a few items (that weren't on the menu) such as sesame chocolate-filled dough balls which were really tasty.  Overall, it was a fantastic place to dine at and has become my new favorite sushi restaurant. The service was extremely friendly and warm (which I find is oddly rare at Sushi restaurants lately). I even took a platter home for my family after we finished. Coming here from now on!"}
{"text":"My friends and I always come here for lunch. For the price you pay, it's really great. There's quite a selection but the portions for the appetizers are a bit smaller than I'm used to. The service is also great, the people are very nice but they have gotten my orders wrong a few times. All in all, I do recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. I've dined here a few times for their AYCE which for their price is really worth it. $21.99 for weekday Dinner AYCE, add $2 for weekends.  Quality and service is top notch. Rolls are not over filled with rice.   I've ordered the roll party trays many times and it's always been a hit at my family parties. When I tell them how much it costs they're amazed and ask how is that possible and from where?!? The great thing about the roll trays are you get to select which rolls you want. 48pc is about $25, 70pc is around $40 (cash payment - takeout only) .  This is my go to takeout sushi restaurant. Even though it's a little bit far for me I'm still willing to make the trek for it!"}
{"text":"Picked up some sushi to go, rice tasted burnt and the rolls were falling apart. Seriously 30 minutes later and there's still a burnt taste in my mouth. Soya sauce tasted extremely watered down. One star is justifiable solely because the rolls were very cheap, decent sized, and the servers were also very polite."}
{"text":"The sashimi was fresh.  Service was excellent!  Can't really find a Japanese AYCE restaurant for under $23.00 nowadays with the price of food going up... .    Found the selection wasn't as good as other Japanese AYCE restaurants but, the food was good!! .   I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We were craving sushi and usually very skeptical of trying sushi places we've never been to. This place surpassed our expectations by far!! The food was great, presentation was great and service was exceptional. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"To go sushi is good and delicious. Very affordable if you get the party tray. The futomaki roll was delicious! Make sure to pay cash to get a discount when picking up"}
{"text":"Service was fanatic. This the reason for my two stars.  This place is run by Chinese and the quality of the fish isn't all that great.  I would only recommend if you're looking for deep fried stuff like tempura etc.  I wouldn't come back again personally"}
{"text":"I went to this place a few days after I came back from Japan. That might be one of the reasons why I thought it was really bad, as opposed to bad.  First of all, they slice the fish really small and thin, and they put way too much rice in each peace of nigiri. The taste of the fish is meh at best. Also, I don't know if they messed up the preparation of the rice, but it just wasn't right (the taste of sugar was overpowering). The rolls I got were messy and had too much rice as well.  I got tempura shrimp too but they were soggy and cold. At least the miso soup was good.  You know that feeling you get, when you put a perfect piece of sushi in your mouth? You eyes open up widely, the fish melts in your mouth, a party of flavours starts to form in mouth... it's controlled yet it's a blast... well, you will never have that feeling here.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is a true hidden gem. I've been here multiple times on both weekends and weekdays for both lunch and dinner and can say that with no doubt in my mind this is one of my favourite sushi restaurants I've ever been to. The owner and all of the staff are super pleasant and very attentive to all of the little details. The fish taste very fresh and the sushi is rolled to order, Something that seems to be scarce with a CYE restaurants these days. Both the lunch and dinner menu have many options which are all delicious. The only downside is the restaurant itself is very small meaning that after 6 PM on the weekends it can get pretty busy.All in all this restaurant is great I come here at least once a week"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been craving sushi so we went to shogi which is right outside her school and in front of wonderland. The place is really neat, good lighting and they gave us a a table as soon as we walked in! The staff were really nice, friendly and attentive  The price for all you can eat is good depending on how much you eat lol  The food was great especially since we were so hungry and ate the whole restaurant for like $15 which is the all you can eat price It's cozy but since a lot of people come and go I would prefer a less crowded area, maybe it's time to get a bigger space.  Overall a great sushi experience !!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday after reading all the amazing reviews about this \"little gem.\" My expectations were pretty high and I have to admit, they did not disappoint. The staff was extremely friendly, up to the point where it was a little over the top. So much so that no empty dish would stay at our table for more than 10 seconds. And I am not exaggerating.. Lol.   The food was exceptional by ayce standards. My mouth was enjoying every food item and I highly recommend their beef teriyaki which simply melted in my mouth.  The decor was simple, yet beautiful and due to their small size, it felt extremely cosy considering there was snowfall outside.   Last, but not least they had these delicious red bean sesame balls on their dessert menu, which is not a norm on ayce dessert menus. I proceeded to devour them immediately as they came to the table, and a few seconds later the waitress/owner warned us they were hot and as she saw that I had finished mine, she started laughing. Moments like this made this experience beyond exceptional and I have nothing but wonderful things to say."}
{"text":"I came to Shogi Sushi based on the Yelp reviews and because I was craving sushi on a Friday night. We came here without reservations around 7:00 PM and were able to get the last available table. They do accept reservations, so I would recommend to make them ahead of time since the restaurant is not very big.  When we sat down, we were promptly given green tea and also the ordering sheet for the AYCE. The price is VERY reasonable at $20.99, and 2$ additional for Friday to Sunday.   We ordered a variety of sashimi, rolls, hand rolls, and cooked kitchen food. Overall, I have to say that the quality is great for AYCE. One of the things that stood out for me, was that the service was very good for an AYCE restaurant. The waitress kept my green tea filled without me asking and promptly took away any finished dishes. As well, I loved the fact that they brought out the sushi/sashmi all at once on a big plate with great presentation, similar to an a la carte restaurant.   When the bill came, it had a 10% discount because they carried on their \"grand opening discount\" even though they've been open for a year. Overall, I give this place 5 stars because it is very good value for money if you are hungry. I would not hesitate to come back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE it here! I'm only a few minutes away from it and it's so convenient when I'm in that sushi mood. I can say without a doubt that this is the best sushi you're going to find for such a low price. And I adore their dragon rolls, my go-to order.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*It is conveniently located nearby Vaughan mills, so we decided to try it out after an afternoon of shopping. Dinner on the weekend (fri-sun) is $24 per adult. We called around an hour before arriving to see if it would be busy, and it was no problem! Reservation accepted for 2 people. Would recommend making one if you can.  When we arrived, parking was not an issue, but it is a small restaurant (9 tables and a small bar). It was pretty quiet when we arrived, Saturday at 6pm.  The menu is quite simple, and doesn't have many extra side dishes (slightly sad that there were more dessert options to choose from). But we definitely had enough to satisfy us. We ordered a few salads, calamari, green dragon (best avocado), California roll, black dragon, scallop, kalbi, a bunch of sashimi, beef teriyaki (so tender).  The service is very attentive and al the food came out of the kitchen quick and hot. But it was kind of pushy by the end. We had been there for about an hour and they gave us the bill when we ordered ice cream. We hadn't asked for the bill yet. Mid way into eating ice cream they asked if we wanted to machine. It would have been nice if we could have finished the ice cream first"}
{"text":"This is a delicious sushi restaurant! Good price for lunch AYCE and yummy unique rolls! Have a lot of staff and are always ready to come to you if you need anything. I have been to a lot of sushi places and this is definitely one of the best! Go here if you get a chance, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"good price for the quality of food that's offered. downside is that there's a little wait for seating during dinner hours, and almost every time that i've visited they messed up my order. good customer service though!"}
{"text":"It's average. I usually get bento boxes at Japanese restaurants so I can attest to their value at Shogi Sushi. Large portions - salmon and chicken teriyaki bento boxes are delicious. Their sushi rolls tend to break on me when I'm eating them. It's a cute, quaint place - cozy. Always had friendly service and fast take out time."}
{"text":"This is all you can eat sushi at its best. The place and the menu are both relatively small but everything is done very well. All the sushi rolls were made with care and the sashimi was very fresh. I would definitely recommend the beef teriyaki and the soba noodles. This place is also very reasonably priced compared to other AYCE places. My only wish was that they had a more expansive dessert menu to complete the perfect meal. I look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch $13.99 till 4:00pm which is a sweet price ($2.00 extra on Fri, Sat, Sun, and Holidays). I ordered multiple avocado / cucumber rolls. Fresh avocado. Good avocado-to-rice ratio. Place might look tiny from the outside but it's decently spacious from the inside. Modern decor. Friendly service. Overall I was very impressed. You can't go wrong with avocado."}
{"text":"Oh yes the AYCE had me hooked.  The portions here are on the generous side for AYCE and the non-sushi sides were even delectable.  Everything was so fresh and so well constructed I didn't want to stop eating.  Service was also fast and attentive.  I almost had to call a forklift to carry me out there, it was great!"}
{"text":"I used to go here when it was Kazuki but now that it's Shogi, I eat here at least once a week. It's my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant.   The sushi always tastes fresh and they never overload the rolls with rice. My top 3 favourites are their sweet potato, dynamite, and black dragon roll. Those are must-haves! For the hot food items, I usually love ordering their beef teriyaki and chicken katsu. The teriyaki is drenched in the most savoury teriyaki sauce and the katsu is so crispy. In terms of service, they always go over and beyond what is asked. Every time I go eat there for AYCE, our sushi platter is decorated beautifully with butterfly-shaped cut carrots, rose shaped salmon sashimi, and a small light cube that changes colours. The orders almost always come out promptly and the service is always accommodating. My tea or water is never empty, which is a GREAT thing because at some restaurants I'll be sitting there thirsty for a glass of water for what seems like hours!  There's no doubt I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I'm currently trying to discover new AYCE sushi joints near me as I just moved into the area and I actually enjoyed my first time at Shogi Sushi.   The shop itself is quite small but very cozy and I was seated quickly. The way you order is on paper which didn't surprise me as how small the place is.   The sushi and sashimi was good, I loved the display they did for our food because you wouldn't have expected something so beautiful from such a small shop. The sushi rice was a little loose and fell off my rolls or broke with my sushi pieces so my plate looked like a mess. But the sashimi was nice and fresh! (Canadian Clam is actually surf clam)  The service was great, the waitress was really sweet and always made sure things were okay with us and there was one waiter helping them out and he was so sweet too.   Loved this experience thanks to staff, will be returning again!"}
{"text":"Shogi is an amazing place for AYCE sushi, especially in Vaughan! The service is awesome - always fairly fast and extremely friendly. Prices are pretty decent as well, you definitely get your money's worth if you have an appetite. I come here regularly and have had an enjoyable experience every single time."}
{"text":"This in my opinion is the best sushi place in Vaughan. I didn't want to take a chance tbh when it was kazuki (previous name), also the location is not the best. But I am surprised at the quality of sushi and the quality of service provided by Shogi Sushi, hands down amazing. Their sushi to their kitchen dishes go beyond the expectations of average all you can eat sushi joins. 5 stars !!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, 4 stars for the food.  Sushi Rolls were great, small amount of rice, good quality.  Beef teriyaki really tender, one of the best from many ayce lunch sushi I have tried.  Can't comment on their sashimi thou since I'm not a fan of raw fish.    Small place, but definitely deserve a try if you are looking for ayce sushi in the area.  Plus, they are offering a 15% off grand opening special, call to check thou."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great quality sushi for a very reasonable price.  Definitely in my top 3 places in the GTA for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"My brother and I stumbled into Shogi Sushi as we were looking for a quick sushi dinner to satisfy his cravings - \"Sushi is life\" he says. While quickly glancing at reviews I had assumed Shogi would have a-la-carte selections but then was handed an AYCE card the moment we were seated. Pricing was very reasonable so we did the AYCE. I'm not sure if they have a-la-carte options.   We selected a variety of fried items, miso soup, seaweed salad, maki rolls, sushi, and dessert. I would say the quality is very good for the price so you're really getting a good bang for your buck - I paid $15.99 adult and $9.98 for a child for weekend lunch AYCE. The quantity is small enough that there's no waste. The makis came out in 6 rolls and all fried items came out in either 1-2 pieces per order. They had an interesting maki roll that had fried banana, cream cheese and shrimp tempura (I forget the name). It sounded interesting so we got it and were pleasantly surprised at how good it was.   The food came out very quickly and service was the most attentive I've ever received at an AYCE restaurant! The moment one of the plates were empty, a waitress came swooping in to grab it and rearrange everything else on the table. They even periodically emptied the plate for empty edamame shells! They did forget one item we ordered (the tuna sushi pizza) but quickly made it and brought it out to us when I asked about it.   It's in a small plaza so parking is limited but usually available right outside since it's not exactly a high traffic area. I'm definitely adding Shogi Sushi to my sushi go-to list in Vaughan!"}
{"text":"Lunch is only $12.99 which you really can't beat, but you get what you pay for. Their selection is limited and quality is below average. Service is poor.   We had: 1) Miso soup: Very salty.  2) California roll: Average. Cucumber wasn't fresh and you can tell because it was translucent and soft. Somehow lacked flavour. Worst thing was that it was lukewarm. Same goes with the spicy salmon.  3) Salmon sushi: Salmon was warm and a very pale colour. 4) Flying fish roe: Good except it was almost all rice with a thin layer of fish roe.  5) Spicy salmon: The fact that it was warm really shows its lack of freshness. It did not have much flavour despite the spicy mayo mixed in.  6) Golden California roll: Warm and lacking flavour.  7) Special roll (can't remember the name but it had salmon, avocado, shrimp, cream cheese, and was deep fried): All I could taste was the grease from the roll being deep fried. Very off putting.  8) Spicy salmon pizza: Lacking flavour and \"crust\" was way too thick.  9) Beef teriyaki: Probably the most decent thing here which isn't a good thing considering this is a sushi place.  10) Chicken on a stick: So greasy it almost slipped out of my mouth.  11) Green tea and red bean ice cream: Yummy. The usual kind you get at most sushi places.  12) Sesame ball: Really good.   As you can see, we tried a decent amount of items yet nothing really stood out (in a positive way). Warm sushi is pretty gross and I hope my stomach will hold up!   The service was strange it say the least. There was one server who was literally circling our table and watching us like a hawk. It was quite uncomfortable. On top of that, I left some rice from the salmon sushi (it was a large portion of rice for a really small portion of salmon) to which she was quite rude about. She said, \"If you won't eat the rice then next time just order the sashimi from our dinner menu\". If they served proper salmon to rice ratio then there would be no need to leave rice behind. That really set a bad tone and made the rest of the meal awkward, especially considering she continued to circle and watch us.   Although this was a cheap eat, I would not go back because of their sub par food and rude service. Not even worth."}
{"text":"Wow.   To begin with - I am typically not a fan of AYCE sushi as it has been a very long time that I come across a decent AYCE sushi joint. If anything, I simply gave up in searching a good AYCE sushi.  Shogi Sushi - is easily, the best AYCE sushi I have in recent memory (5 years+). The price is reasonable, service is amazing (quick, attentive), and food quality is pretty much up there. One thing that stood out is really they have a good ratio of rice-to-meat/fish, everything is served reasonably fresh in good portion size and is tasty!  I also like that they honor your order whatever you put on paper - say you order 9 salmon pieces, they give you exactly what you ordered.   Shogi is a shining example on how an AYCE sushi can do things right - from things I mentioned above. I just hope that this place can continue and maintain this standard and continue to be role model from other sushi joint.  Five stars - highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great prices, fresh sushi, and the presentation of the dishes makes you well aware the chef takes pride in their work. I hope they keep this up."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem. I followed the review based on the Yelp and it totally meets my expectations.   The presentation is very nice - the sushi platter shines with the light in the centre. The food comes very fast and it's exactly the amount we ordered. The most impressive is the services. They always kept an eye on our table and pour water for us and take away the empty dishes. The price is very reasonable too. Now they have 10% off as a promotion to AYCE but not sure how long it will last. I'll for sure come back again or order take out from this place."}
{"text":"At $12.99 for AYCE lunch you can't get any better than this! The sushi is fresh and they have a decent collection of lunch items on their AYCE menu. My favourites were the special rolls, hand rolls and beef teriyaki! Oh, and do try their fried banana with either vanilla or mango ice cream! Service was great as well. My new favourite AYCE sushi place!"}
{"text":"Good quality sushi and fast service. Small spot but worth it. The only thing that we didn't like was we both had to do AYCE, couldn't order off the menu."}
{"text":"Definitely a worth while place to eat all-you-can-eat sushi for it's quality and price. The strawberry salmon avocado maki is my favourite! The decor is pretty good too. However some orders were lost and there is a bit too much rice in the sushi. Overall the food is good for its price! The customer service is good too!"}
{"text":"One of the better ayce sushi places I have been too.  Food comes out quick and presentation was a nice bonus.  The cooked meats were moist and tender.  The sushi and maki had a good balance of rice and other components.  They did forget a few items but overall the service was friendly and attentive.  I went on a Sunday night with a group of 10 people.  Cost was $22.99.   They also gave us a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back to this restaurant! Just had dinner here (Friday night) with the hubby and the food, service and ambiance was excellent! Even though it was busy, staff were still really attentive with smiles on their faces :) Please keep doing what you're doing and keep your employees! So hard to find a restaurant that has all the great qualities. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"It was a nightmare! The place is small not even worth the money. 1)Poor service and the food you order doesn't come out and they have a small limited of dishes.-I have to ask few times the waitress when is my food coming n why it didnt come out.. they dont even tell u why?    2)The rolls are huge they come in 6-8 pieces which the resturant want you tonget full and leave. Dont try their rolls it a stomach filler.  If your hungry dont go here you wont get your food (serve )!   They felt guilty for lack of service it was reflected on the bill they give you 10% off.  The presentation first dish of sashimi looks amazing after that they give up n just throw a bunch of sashimi looks like scrap fish.  I was upset for the slow service Asking for napkin which never receive.  I wont be coming back here ."}
{"text":"this place is a bit small but employees are very kind. The all you can eat menu has so much variety from vegetarian to seafood lovers. The atmosphere and environment of this restaurant is very welcoming and warm. The service is so quick too so you don't have to worry about a long wait. After shopping at vaughn mills, me and my best friend got very hungry and wanted to find a good place to eat at a good price. I really recommend this place, it will absolutely satisfy your cravings!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in this restaurant. Sashimi was literally paper thin. It's supposed to be \"all you can eat\" but orders were dropped. We asked for another paper to put in a second order and the waitress rudely made a joke saying \"you want more food!?\" On another note, we called 30 minutes before arriving and we were told that the price was $21.99 (also shown on the menu) but the price was actually $23.99. When we told the waitresses, they argued with us and refused to change the bill. Not a huge difference in price but we didn't appreciate being told wrong information and the poor service. The table beside us also had this same pricing issue."}
{"text":"We went for lunch AYCE, and it was underwhelming. The quality wasn't that great compared to other AYCE joints nearby, and the menu selection was limited. We went here because other reviews were positive and the photos looked great, but maybe those were from the much more pricier dinner menu ($21.99 vs $13.99 lunch price). The servers were very uncomfortable too, constantly walking around, watching people closely, while also looking like they don't want to work there. Maybe the dinner experience is much better. The only plus I'll give us it's in a good location and the place has clean."}
{"text":"Lunch date with the hubby.    Clean and nicely decorated interior.  Lunchtime on a Monday was packed with people.  All you can eat sushi on promotion (bill came to $30/2 people) was generous and the quality good.  The tempura could use seasoning but the presentation of everything was good.  We would return for sure.  Only problem I saw was parking is a bit confusing but they do have parking in the rear as well."}
{"text":"Great value on the all you can eat, and great taste as well. Loved your gyoza best and the special rolls, ice cream was very lovely as well. Overall a good choice, don't let the slightly sketchy exterior faze you"}
{"text":"Amazing food, quick service, didn't have overwhelming amount of rice in the rolls. And it definitely didn't break the bank. Oh ya, and they got sesame balls!!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on Boxing Day and it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. The service was fast and friendly. The restaurant is small size with 8-9 tables so it's more intimate. For those of you who have a crappy phone plans...They don't have wifi for customers lol :(  The sushi was average and nothing spectacular. The selection for the the lunch AYCE could have had more appetizer options. The ginger tasted old and stale which made me question everything the freshness of everything else.   Average experience."}
{"text":"I came here after reading the high reviews and was unfortunately disappointed.   Quality of sushi is typical of all-you-can-eat sushi run by Chinese (as opposed to Japanese or even Korean). The sushi rice is soggy and poorly seasoned, and the fish is bland and has the texture of thawed frozen fish. My wife had the tempura udon and couldn't even finish it. I had the sashimi dinner, which unfortunately included 4 sticks of \"crab\" meat and I couldn't finish it as I lost my appetite after eating a piece of soggy white tuna.  At least the service wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"NO ONE WRITE A BAD REVIEW! Its impossible to! Their good in every way. At the least they could use is a bigger space. But O M G the food is DELICIOUS! Like mouth watering! Will always be happy and excited to go to Shogi. The people are friendly their ever. They basically take you in as family and remember every detail of the things you like and want to the smallest detail. Their very busy but help in every way to accommodate you. Will never say no to go here! I think Im gunna go now just thinking of the food. It might be the same old thing but let me tell you they bring the flavor to a whole new level."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, but my third experience warrants an update on my review. While I stand by my review for my first two experiences, giving this place 5-stars, I am giving my third experience 3-stars, averaging out to 4 stars. The customer service is excellent as always, and they're still offering their 10% off discount. I asked the waitress if she knows how long the 10% off discount will go on for. She said that the boss decides that.   Anyway onto the reason for the 3-stars. The sashimi quality was poor. The first piece of red snapper that I put into my mouth, I had to immediately spit out. It was bitter, tough, and grainy. I thought that piece had gone bad. I tried a different piece of red snapper, and it was the same. The salmon, butterfish, mackerel, and surf clam were edible, but the quality was noticeably worse. The fish definitely had to have been old. Hopefully it's just a one-time thing. I will be back in the future, and hopefully my experiences will be more of the former."}
{"text":"Great sushi! the chicken katsu was a tad dry but overall great experience! and the service was very good as well."}
{"text":"Came all the way from Richmond Hill here for the sushi. When we got here place was packed. Service was just alright. Came here for AYCE sushi, it's good based on AYCE sushi, but the other things from the kitchen were just alright. Beef short ribs tasted a little soapy, same with their miso (and usually it's amazing at other places). Sashimi cuts looked like they cut half a whole cut of sashimi. My friend and I almost had to scream over the environment sound because it was that loud during dinner. I sort of went here with high expectations according to the ratings, but maybe the people rating this sushi place haven't been exposed to quality sushi =/. To be honest, I've had better AYCE in the GTA...  One thing I do have to give to them is their presentation. Great presentation.   Maybe I would come back when I'm in the area for lunch (not dinner), but not necessarily would drive the distance for AYCE. If you're in the area, its a pretty good sushi place."}
{"text":"found this place on yelp and convinced my bf to come here since i hate the few places hes taken me too in vaughn for sushi. and i founddd a place im willing to go back too!  the servers were super attentive. the food was good and presented really nice. they went the extra mile with everything even refilling tea. and price for dinner was very reasonable compared to other places like heart sushi. GO!"}
{"text":"Great AYCE place that is conveniently located across from Wonderland!  Price is decent and the quality of the food is on par with other AYCE joints. The sashimi is cut really thin, so make sure you order a lot! Servers were nice and accommodating - our friends were one hour late for reservations, so we offered to switch to a smaller table while we waited until they arrived - once our friends arrived, they quickly moved us to a bigger table! :). I'm also diabetic so I try to avoid too much rice and sugary sauces - the servers kindly let me order the hand rolls without rice and the beef skewers without the sauce. And I must say, the beef skewers were really good - the beef was soft and tender.... I ate maybe 6 skewers. Overall, great place for dinner!"}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM! If you are a sushi lover you need to give this place a try. I am forever grateful to my friend that introduced me to this place.   Whenever I go to a sushi AYCE restaurant  I don't really have high expectations for service, however everyone here is super attentive and does not look miserable like most servers at AYCE sushi places. Super friendly and actually checks up on you to make sure you're okay. Service is also really quick, however they do miss a couple of items every time I place an order.  The presentation is also really nice, sashimi is fresh, food is always on point and worth the price (super affordable too!) I really, really like this place! I wish it wasn't so out of the way for me or I'd go all the time!   The downside is that you have to place your orders on a paper and pen and have to wait for the servers to come by and grab it. Though servers often pick up your order sheet pretty fast, it'd be a lot more convenient if it was on an iPad so we can send it ourselves. Also the selection here is not as much compared to other sushi restaurants but when the quality of sushi is this amazing... quality over quantity! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new sushi place in Vaughan. This place was in front of Canada Wonderland. The place was in a small plaza, not much parking but they had more parking in the back. The parking was a bit too tight, cars getting in and out from the same entrance and exit onto Jane.  We read a couple of the reviews on Yelp and was super surprised why people lined up here. Our wait was around 20 minutes.  When we were seated, we were waiting for our drinks. The dinner menu did not have a great selection of food compared to other sushi places I have been to but could not complain because this place was much cheaper than most of the sushi places in Vaughan. Really did not like the paper menu because they kept missing out orders and bringing the wrong order to our table. I got super annoyed that he thought we lied about our order and did not apologize to us.   I am pretty positive I will not be coming here again, there are better sushi places with amazing service in Vaughan!"}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh and at unbeatable prices. Rolls can be as low as $2.95 per roll for regular rolls. We ordered a miso soup, eel over rice, spicy salmon roll with tempura flakes, and a fried roll with cooked fish inside. Everything was good. I could definitely see myself frequenting this place if I lived in this area. Service is fast too."}
{"text":"Sushi Date with the girlfriend. Were Sushi enthusiasts and This spot was next on our list. I've gotten used to IPad sushi ordering, but here still had pencil and paper. It brought it had to the essence of when I started going to sushi without pictures.  The price was reasonable, the SERVICE is excellent, the ladies filling our waters always kept us hydrated. The sushi was presented beautifully, the sushi was great, but my \"other\" favourite part of sushi is the fried food. They were amazing except one item... the spicy chicken. It was dry and smothered in sauce...   One thing that made the experience different was that we didn't finish our food but for $2 bucks I brought home the unfinished sushi, and for an extra $4 I brought home more of the fried food. Amazing!!   My only con is that with the pencil and paper you can be sitting there for 5-10 mins after you written anything down, then they'll take your paper unless it's not busy. Other than that! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Shogi is an AYCE Japanese Buffet restaurant. It's one of the many that have popped up over the years in the GTA in competition for the mighty dollar.  Before I continue, I would like to declare a few things that have impacted this review. 1. Most AYCE Japanese Buffets in the GTA are actually run by the Chinese. 2. With cost of living so high, most businesses can't yield on the price, so they boost offerings (value), decor, and other fancies to elevate the dining experience and attract customers.  Shogi is located by Canada's Wonderland with Rutherford to the south and Major Mackenzie to the north. It's a small establishment located in a strip plaza on the east side of Jane St. The place seems to be under new ownership/management and remnants of the old business is visible (the new ShoGi Sushi sign is actually laid on top of the former business name). The good news it, the old business looks to also be a Japanese restaurant.  The AYCE menu is captured in a single sheet. Rather than go over every item which would be impossible, I'll concentrate on what is lacking and what was spectacular.  Lacking: I noticed immediately that they have no Sashimi offerings. One of my pet peeves when it comes to AYCE. This forces you to order Sushi and often AYCE places threat surcharges if you order too much and waste the food. Other notables NOT present are: soft shell crab (appetizer); Enoki (beef rolls); and beef tataki (raw beef). From Sushi selections, staples like Tuna (Red and White); Ikura (Salmon Roe); Amaebi (freshwater shrimp; Tako (Octopus); Yellowtail; Hokkigai (Surf Clam); Ika (Squid); and Uni (Sea Urchin) are missing. Now I can understand no Uni and Ikura as those can be costly to procure, but Surf Clam is dirt cheap!  Spectacular: ... now that I'm thinking about it, nothing really stood out at spectacular... so I'll just describe some of the things I tasted.  Tempura. The batter was on the heavy side for tempura (not light and airy as tempura should be), so either the water wasn't cold enough, there wasn't enough soda, or it just simply sat out too long. The shrimp was also coated heavily with batter (usually a result of sitting out too long and/or poor refrigeration). Heavy batter will also absorb lots of oil as shrimp will require more time during cooking. The vegetable tempura fared a little better, and while the batter was still heavy, they managed a thinner coating. Overall, I'd stay away from the tempura, 1 star.  Gyoza (pan fried pork and vegetable dumplings aka pot stickers). The filling actually had many of the ingredients; pork, green onion (not exactly chives, but I'll give it to them since most people find that flavour of chives quite powerful), and cabbage. Ginger and garlic was not present, but like chives, many aren't too fond of the strong flavours these give off. The sauce is really just equal parts of vinegar and soy (peppers may be added for spice) and was a little more on the vinegar side. 2 stars.  Specialty Rolls. These were prepared decently in terms of packing. The contents held well when picked up. The proportion of rice to filling ingredients was good. Visually, the rolls were presented well and were cut fairly evenly. 3 stars.   Sushi. Not being a big fan of the carbs, the rice was decent. Not too glutinous and not overcooked. While it held together, I didn't quite get that slight sweetness at the end (when dipping sushi, only the fish should touch the soy, never the rice as it will absorb too much of the soy and that's all you'll taste). There was not wasabi between the fish and the rice (which seems more typical nowadays as everyone has varying degrees of tolerance). The proportion of fish to rice was good, the fish covering the entire length including the ends; however the thickness of the fish was a slightly on the thin side. 3 stars.  Wasabi. Like 99.9% of dining establishments, the wasabi is instant. But even then, this varies depending on level of dilution. The wasabi here had next to no bite, only the slightest hints of horseradish were detected and not consistently. 2 stars.  Gari (Ginger). This is supposed to be young ginger for a milder flavour and marinated in vinegar and sugar. The marination wasn't bad, but the ginger was inconsistent in terms of age. Some of it was young, some wasn't. 2 stars.  Cooked Dishes. These were not bad in general, the fried rice, meat skewers (tori), cutlets (katsu), and grill items (tobanyaki). 3,5 stars.  Miso. Soup was instant (like 99,9% of places) and on the salty side. 2 stars.  Salad Dressing. This varies greatly, but they are mostly vinegar based (very few places make it mayo based, and if so, they're heavily diluted) with flavours of sesame and garlic, doubling as a texture enhancer as well. As simple as this sounds, it's actually quite complex. I can only recall twice being surprised by the dressing, unfortunately this place was not one of them. 2 stars.  Overall the price they charge is not worth what's on the menu. 2 stars."}
{"text":"Came here based on the Yelp reviews after a long day at Canada's Wonderland.  We decided to order from the regular menu instead of the AYCE.  This place is probably solely focused on AYCE since they didn't have a menu other than the take-out menu.  Regardless, the food here was great! A lot of their rolls had cheese in them which was a little strange for me but nonetheless added richness and flavour to the already fresh and delicious sushi.    One person at our table ordered the Mixed Seafood Udon Soup which they mixed up with the stir fry udon... Other than that, service was attentive but not annoying.  Water and tea was refilled frequently (like any other buffet or AYCE places) and we were consistently asked if we needed anything.    This is a Chinese place but they definitely know how to get their sushi right! Will definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I came out of my way to try this place but I was decently surprised. It's pretty affordable, and right across the street from Wonderland (and near Vaughan Mills).   The restaurant is pretty small and easy to miss, I've never noticed it there before. However the decor inside is pretty nice and clean, which I especially appreciate in a sushi joint.  Their lunch prices are considerably more affordable than other all you can eat sushi places nowadays, so I can see why this place has pretty good reviews. Their food is good, nothing special. My only issue was that their sushi pieces have a bit too much rice, which can get you full pretty fast.  I would probably go back if I'm ever craving all you can eat sushi while I'm in that area already, but I wouldn't make a mission just to come."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. AYCE was not a disappointment. Daughters loved the shrimp teriyaki and salmon sashimi. Sushi was beautifully presented and the right temperature. Ice creams for dessert was a nice way to end the night."}
{"text":"We came to Shogi Sushi for lunch today after seeing an advertisement in the local paper. The restaurant is located where the Kazuki Sushi used to be, across from Canada's Wonderland. Most of the parking spots were taken, but inside the restaurant there's a sign that says that customers can use parking in the back. The restaurant has 9 tables (6 of which can hold a group of 4). The decor was pretty much the same as Kazuki.  Shogi offers AYCE sushi for $13 for lunch, but is an extra $2 for Friday through Sunday. The sushi was really good. We had salmon, butterfish, fish roe, clam, and spicy salmon sushi. I thought the salmon sushi was really good. It was warm, which I like (no ice-cold fish for me please!). The shrimp tempura was tasty and light. It's not over-fried and hard like some other places. We really liked the beef teriyaki. The beef was tender, again unlike other places that might serve overcooked beef. We also tried the happy hour roll and the spicy butterfish roll, both were very tasty.  I also tried the red bean ice cream, which was tasty. One of the owners came by and asked if we'd like to try the sesame ball, which has red bean inside. It's not on the menu. It was super nice to ask, but we were stuffed! The wait service was very prompt and attentive.  In an area where there are a number of competing AYCE sushi restaurants, Shogi is definitely a strong contender. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends and for an AYCE sushi it was pretty good.  To be honest, the beef teriyaki and shrimp teriyaki was the bomb.  The beef was the softest I've ever had and the shrimp was so yummy I kept on asking for more lol.  The sushi was pretty decent.  They had alot of sushi with cream cheese which is different.    If ur hungry like super hungry then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Conveniently located across the street from Canada's Wonderland, I popped in for AYCE sushi lunch on a sat. It's $14.99 for lunch. Menu selection is quite limited. Restaurant is small. The tempura was light and crunchy but heavily battered. The miso soup was watered down. We ordered several sushi and rolls. The fish on the sushi was sliced paper thin over and rice was too thick. Overall the food was bland and disappointing."}
{"text":"Good AYCE Japanese. The lunch selection is lacking. It would be better if they have more hot dish selection  for lunch. Dinner selection is better. Service is great, they always come and refill my tea."}
{"text":"Shopping at Vaughan mills made me hungry lol. I went to look at the choices at the food court and they're all the usual in most shopping mall.   So instead I checked Yelp for nearby Japanese restaurants. Thought I'll go with Shogi since it has more positive reviews than negatives. And those comments that the place was packed and food was excellent made me decide to come here.   Well we went in and I always make a note of how the entrance look. I don't understand how they can't keep the entrance clean. This place is small maybe just for 30 seats yet they can't keep it clean. Old dirty mat and door that's so dirty I wish I was wearing my gloves to open it. So we seated and it's an All you can eat place. $12.99 per person for lunch and $20.99 for dinner. We're here for lunch. We were given a one page menu and not much selection considering other places in this category has more interesting items. We had crispy crab roll (fake crab meat ), special roll with tuna slices on top, shrimp tempura, chicken teriyaki, soba noodle, miso soup and two hand rolls. One reviewer here was right!  The slices of tuna, salmon were super thin. Service was great but I find the food was below standard. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here cuz was getting bored of my usual spot. Was surprised on a Monday how busy it was and it was only 1130!  We had AYCE for $12 for Lunch.  Not bad especially since it had my faves (butterfish, shrimp tempura and rainbow sushi). Sushi was fresh and, on recommendations from Yelp reviews, we tried the beef teriyaki and ended up getting two more orders! Definitely can't wait to go back with the family."}
{"text":"This sushi place is actually really good! We went on a Friday night and waited about five minutes for a table.  It's small but quite nice!   The staff were super attentive and asked multiple times if we wanted more food or drinks. The food was also delicious! The rolls and sushi were all very good and fresh.   Despite reading reviews saying they don't have a lot of sides, they actually did! We had soup, salads, noodles, rice, chicken and many tempura as sides.  For $24 a person (on weekends), it can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Came here twice now, food was great the first time just as all the reviews say, however second time around was HORRIBLE! Sushi was very very wet and mushy as if the rice and kelp wraps weren't made /stored properly.   Still rating three stars as first time was good and maybe they were just off that day."}
{"text":"Food Delicious. Lots of variety for a small place.  Service  Prompt and friendly  Atmosphere Cozy and comfortable. Hilarious how they have sticky notes randomly.  Price Cheap. Ayce is well priced."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre.   After a trip to wonderland, my friend and I were craving for some sushi, so we went on yelp and found Shogi Sushi. It was only a couple minutes from wonderland, so we thought to try it out. We got to the restaurant around 5, it was fairly small with around 12 tables. They weren't too busy, but as time went by, it got busier. A lot of people also came for take out.   The menu is fairly small and typical. I'm used to a gigantic menu (from Markham)... the dinner price was $23.99, which was pretty decent. They also charge $1.85 for soft drinks (which comes in a very hot can...), once you pay the amount, it's all you can drink, hot soft drinks!   The food was typical, they often miss items that we order... they also have a section for \"salads,\" with a choice of spicy salmon, spicy tuna, or crab - it was pretty cool, we ordered a spicy salmon salad, which came in a small individual portion of just spicy salmon on top of shredded cucumbers! There wasn't really anything else that was special, or good compared to the other Ayce sushi places...   The service was just okay."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Good quality and portions.  Very small place so don't go when they are busy and I really hope they fix their outside door which stays open if used. Makes the place really cold! If they don't fix it then I am not going on winter...lol"}
{"text":"Visited Shogi Sushi on a Wednesday night. I was looking for reasonably priced AYCE and found this place. It's small inside but it was a pretty slow night so we were seated immediately.   We ordered sushi and sashimi along with teriyaki chicken and beef, tempura shrimp and yam, stir fry udon noodles and fried rice. Everything tasted fantastic, and the food came out really quickly after being ordered. They had a really nice display for the sushi which is always a nice touch. AYCE was about $22 a person which is really good for the quality of food you're getting.   The service was great. The waitresses made sure to refill our waters when they were running low and asked us if we were okay every so often. They cleared away plates almost as soon as they were empty.   I have to admit, we ordered a little bit more than we could handle so there was some waste. The only reason why this place is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because one of the waitresses actually scolded us for ordering too much. We already felt bad enough but that just made us feel worse. Kind of left us on a sour note at the end of our meal. Other than that, everything was great. Will probably be visiting again."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery since we were feeling kind of lazy. We had the House special sushi rolls tray. Presentation was quite nice (in a platter instead of foam boxes). Sushi tasted fresh but the fish was cut quite thin. There was ample wasabi and ginger. Delivery was free to our house as we ordered over $30. I would order here again and definitely try eating in as well."}
{"text":"Came to this place last night - looking for a different AYCE Japanese restaurant. Really small restaurant, but service was great, and food was good. Rolls didn't have much rice, which was a bonus. Food came out quickly, and there were no issues with the order. Fish was fresh and hot food was tasty. Spicy chicken, however was just chicken chunks with sriracha sauce poured on it. At $24, we were really happy. *bonus, presentation of rolls came out as a nice surprise with flashing led light :)"}
{"text":"I am a lover of ayce sushi so I came here w my girlfriend for lunch sushi on sat. 12.99+2.00 which was a pretty decent deal. And with 4 stars I didn't think I could go wrong. Boy was I wrong. First glance at the menu I didn't know what to pick because it was missing my favourite lunch items, philedelphia rolls and salmon sushi flowers. I ordered a whole bunch of different sushi and rolls. They give wrong quantities on purpose, one of my biggest ayce pet peeves. 6 salmon sushi instead of 10, no unagi nstead of 4. Then, when the sushi arrived, I realized the fish to rice ratio was outrageous.. fish weren't that fresh either. Kitchen dishes were lacking, no beef ribs or sweet sour/sesami pork or ramen, etc etc..  maybe it may be a 4/5 stars north of Rutherford but definitely a 2/5 for GTA. They get a 2 at least because location was clean and waitresses were nice and attentive. Actually a little too attentive I felt like being watched."}
