{"text":"Found out about this place from a friend and I'm glad I did! Nothing feels better than buying some cheap tteokbokki takeout on the way home and supporting the super nice lady who works there! I don't speak Korean, but she was still really friendly and welcoming.  The inside is pretty much the size of a walk-in closet, but don't let that scare you away. It's nicely decorated and has a long bar table for you to sit and scarf down your delicious food.  Definitely come here if you want cheap, affordable, but delicious Korean food~"}
{"text":"Good price and decent taste. Freshly made and authentic to the bone. I guess I am just not the biggest kimpbob fan."}
{"text":"I have lived in Korea and can vouch for the authenticity of this place. The Manna always serves delicious, authentic Korean food for dirt cheap. The couple who owns this place are super nice and friendly and bring me back to Korean hospitality. Tuna kimbap and tteokkbokki rules all!"}
{"text":"the food is made to order and cheap and the lady is really really nice, I love this place and I loved going here for lunch when i studdied at central tech and I still go there now !. this place has amazing rice cake soup, kimchi noodles and VEGETARIAN KIMBAP :) i hope this place never changes :) also IT'S RIGHT BY THE SUBWAY STATION :)"}
{"text":"The Manna-oh-nanana Half of my heart is in The Manna-oh-nanana (sing to Havana by Camila Cabello)  I'm funny right?! This super cute, independent woman-owned korean restaurant has all the essential korean main dishes you need in your life! I got the kimchi fried rice and bibimbap to go which were both just perfect to satisfy my hunger while still being relatively cheap. Most dishes are $3-4 cheaper than your typical korean restaurant's and it's without tax. One downside is there aren't many side dishes but she does give you miso soup everytime!"}
{"text":"The Manna is more of a 3.5 star restaurant for me, but its tuna kimbap is bomb! Therefore, it needs a 4!  Small in capacity size and highly inconspicuous, The Manna is truly a ''hidden'' gem.  If you're a commuter, it's  right beside  Christie Station. You can probably fit up to 6 people in here. As the seating is bar style, I don't really advise using this place as your first choice for an intimate discussion though.   The prices have gone up over the years, unfortunately.  Despite not being able to call them cheap eats any more, I can at least say the meals are still at a fair price.  The kimbap options are the cheapest items with them being priced at about 4-5 dollars. The pieces are large in size and the portion is perfect for a light eater. The tuna version spills over with a delicious tuna-mayo spread, so it's a must-try item in my belief!  In addition, you can also order the regular home-style fare from kimchi fried price to oden to ddukbokki and more.  However, other than the kimbap and the bean/nut soups (or jook), which are rare in the GTA, nothing really stands out. Just grab a jook and kimbap to snag good quality for the price and portion size."}
{"text":"Really good kimbap and reasonable price. I ordered a regular kimbap and a plate of doubuki(rice cake). Since I don't eat spicy food, I asked the lady if she can make it less spicy, she was very very nice, she made it with soy sauce just for me....."}
{"text":"I came here coz of the high rate on Yelp. The greatest thing here is the low price! I ordered a beef kimbap which cost me only 5$. There're not many seats in the restaurant, so take out is a good option. Definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time today to pick up some kimbab for school. Was delighted to see her making them fresh right there! Got the beef and tuna kimbap. Definitely yummy and cheap. Gonna try the congee next time :) This place is small but def has the home - feel to it. Oh! Also had the toekbokki while waiting for the kimbabs (around 10mins) It was delicious and spicy.. Love it!"}
{"text":"Hole in wall Korean;5 seats. Nice couple . All freshly made .Toronto at it's authentic off the boat finest"}
{"text":"First meal in Toronto. So many freakin' choices on Bloor Street West, it's unreal. I walked all the way down to Koreatown and could not for the life of me figure out which Korean place to eat at. I finally pulled the trigger and opted to try The Manna as it reminded me of the small mom and pop restaurants back in South Korea. I was the first visitor of the day as one of the workers was sitting in the middle of the floor but moved right away once I stepped inside.  Outside menu to entice you inside. No one else was there so I quickly perused the menu (all hanging on the walls with pictures to boot). Surprised it was empty given that it was Friday lunchtime. The place is tiny with only a handful of seats to eat at the counter. They pack everything up takeout style so I ended up heading over to nearby Christie Pits Park for a mini picnic.  - Soup - pretty standard side soup but I liked how it retained it's hotness while I sat outside.  - Tuna kimbap ($4.50) - you get 10 pieces of kimbap which is a killer deal. Fresh, filling, they hit the spot. Would have been nice to have ordered half tuna and half beef to change things up a bit.  - Chicken bibimbap ($8.50) - fried egg, carrots, yellow pickled radish, spinach, cucumber, bean sprouts, radish and a few other things. They served the gochujang in a separate container so you can adjust to the amount of heat level you like. I wasn't a big fan of the fried egg but I guess it's hard to do a raw egg when it's takeout. Overall, decent bibimbap.  No fuss, hole in the wall Korean joint."}
{"text":"I had not been there in a couple of years, and was so pleased to go there again.  They have increased their menu options.  The nackzi bokkum with rice (nackzi dup bap) was absolutely gorgeous.  Luscious gochuchang, nice deep flavour and generous lashings of gochu garu, garlic, green onion, onions, sesame oil -- sprinkled with black sesame seeds.  The lady is an exceptional cook.  I reminisced about the old days in Korea with a fellow diner - who was also enjoying this lovely establishment.  It is small, cozy - but inviting and like being in someone's home!  Two small panchan sides -- which were good (shredded lotus root with soya sauce and mat kimchi).  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Not only is the food really cheap at Manna, it's also made fresh to order by the Korean mom and pop. The small menu and limited dine-in space is designed to encourage take out. Their business card doubles as a menu so that you can pre-order by phone.  When I stumbled across this fantastic hole in the wall and decided to grab an order of kimbap (Korean sushi roll) to go, I was very surprised to see the lady expertly assemble it so quickly before my eyes. For $3.50, it was fresh, healthy, and filling. I really look forward to returning to try their Korean staple hot dishes and interesting variety of congee (including black sesame, red bean, pumpkin, vegetable, and abalone)."}
{"text":"Fourthing what everyone has said so far -- it's a little hard to find, but worth it! I've only gotten the kimbap, but it's made to order, fresh, and one very massive roll for $3.50. Service is friendly as well. Overall, a solid to-go spot, especially for an afternoon snack or light lunch."}
{"text":"Went passed here once and wanted to try out this spot (today). I tried their dukbokki, a reasonable price and the lady there gave me a good portion of it as well. I expected it to be spicy but it wasn't, I didn't drink any water haha. The sauce was not as thick as if you were to go to other Korean restaurants. I would come back to try other things such as the kimbap!"}
