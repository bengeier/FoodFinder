{"text":"Normally when I fly in to Montreal I don't have time to grab a bite to eat before heading off to my first meeting. 

Today I had some extra time and so I decided to do something rare and have breakfast for a change. 

Since I had some time to actually sit down to eat, I figured Tim Horton's and Illy weren't going to cut it, so I decided to take a walk down to the Marriott. 

The Bijou Restaurant is located in the hotel right around the corner from the front desk. 

The atmosphere was pleasant with some Latin music playing softly in the background. The restaurant is filled with natural light and is tastefully decorated. 

I decided to have the breakfast buffet, which consisted of the following items:

Breads (English Muffins, Bagels, Toast, Croissant)
Assorted Pastries
Oatmeal
Assorted Cereals
Assorted Fresh Fruit (Pineapple, Raspberries, Blueberries, Melon, Oranges, Apples)
Assorted Cheese
Bacon
Sausage
French Toast
Breakfast Potatoes 
Yoghurt
As well as a made to order Omelette Bar

I had a variety of these items which were all fresh. The Omelette Bar has a variety of standard toppings and was prepared for me quickly and delivered to my table. 

The Hostess and my waiter were both very pleasant and attentive. My Orange Juice was refilled several times and I was also provided with a small berry smoothy. 

I was also offered a newspaper and asked if I was staying at the hotel (which I wasn't). 

Overall it was a pleasant experience that allowed me to have some personal time as well as a good meal. 

Price wise, it's a Marriot, so expect to pay about $20 plus tip. A fair price given the location and quality of the food items offered."}
{"text":"I was staying in the airport hotel Marriott overnight so as to be on time for my 4:30 AM security clearance & check-in. This restaurant is part of the hotel and is one of the better in-airport restaurants I have been to. I had the Bison ribs which were excellent!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a great lunch here. The onion soup was best I've had maybe ever. Good service, nice place."}
{"text":"A kid threw up all over the floor in front of our table. 

Food was so-so; the burger was well done (Canadian law) and dry.

They took forever to take our order once we sat down and never brought the ketchup we asked for after we received our food. 

There was only one server for at least 15 tables, super understaffed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is inside the hotel Marriott directly at the airport.

If you happen to find yourself at the airport and don't have the time to head back to the city (Montreal), this is probably and unfortunately your best choice.
It has a very nice ambiance and good service. The food has elements of greatness, but fails time and time again in the execution.

Asparagus soup: Delicious. I particular like the small flakes of goat cheese they added. It added just a hint of of a very nice flavor.
Onion Soup: Pretty good.
Halibut: Overcooked
Steak: First overcooked, and when I sent it back the next one came back undercooked.
Deserts: Ok

Again, probably your best choice at the airport, but nothing to write home about.
If you can, take a taxi to Montreal (foodie heaven)."}
{"text":"Bijou is the only restaurant within the Montreal Marriott. It's also the only one within walking distance, unless you want to try your luck in the airport. Consequently it suffers from \"the only choice around\" syndrome: It's attractive inside and the food is decent, but the prices are very high.

The breakfast buffet here was $24 - Not very cost effective if I just wanted a pastry and a bowl of fruit. Even when I ordered a bowl of oatmeal from the menu, it was still almost $20 with coffee and tip. At least work was paying for it.

A nice positive for Bijou was that the lounge and bar were open until midnight.  Their pours were quite healthy as well.  Since I was still on California time, sometimes an 11 pm nightcap was just the thing to get me sleepy enough when my body thought it was 8:00."}
{"text":"I had an excellent dinner at this Marriott restaurant and bar. There are not many choices for good restaurants in this area without going to downtown Montreal. They have a nice large bar area with large windows...not much of a view but a lot of natural light.
The bartender was great, pleasant and well informed on all of the food...made me a great old fashioned with Sazarac and a marinated cherry.
The food was exceptional...I had the candied salmon app which was basically salmon 2-ways: thin sliced and cured. It was served with some marinated fennel and capers and was damn good.
I ordered snapper for my entree...served with vegetables and a sweet pur√©e- it was very good although the skin was not as crisp as I would have liked. Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered room service after a long day of work, fabulous dinner!!!!! Risotto was outstanding!"}
{"text":"A terrific oasis connected directly to the airport! Relaxing lounge music, a lovely ambiance, and amazing desserts to boot. Try the pouding chomeur, a Quebecois delicacy: a sweet and flaky cake topped with apples, maple caramel, and a scoop of ice cream. Sheer perfection!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, service is good and the food was on point.  I had calamari appetizer and the field greens salad.  Very fresh and tasted like it should."}
{"text":"The restaurant is part of the Marriott there at the Montreal Airport.  It's convenient if you've checked in so you can easily get to an early flight, and I suspect 90% of the guests are fellow travelers.

Service was good, with water promptly refilled and decent pacing.  The decor is sort of corporate elegant ... all blues to match the rest of the hotel.  Not something particularly memorable, but relaxing enough.  

Allow 20 minutes for a crisply roasted Cornish hen. Very tasty. Fish is also fresh, and the salads are just lightly dressed.  Decent beer and wine list."}
{"text":"In spite of the extremely high prices. $50 for 2 glasses of wine and a cup of soup, i like this lounge. They have great food. A full bar, and tonight a very good jazz band. Always come down here and a have a nihhtcap. Staff is good."}
{"text":"Cool bar, great drinks and excellent service. I wish they were open later than midnight! Especially since my flight is at 6:40 AM."}
