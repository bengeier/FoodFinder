{"text":"The portions are very small. The female owner who takes control of the rice and meats section is super cheap! You have to NOTICE her routine. She will give only two scoops of rice but when she goes in to scoop the second time she levels off a lot of the rice so that you get less! They are desperate for customers because you can hear them yelling for you to buy their food when you walk by. Unprofessional. This is not a market."}
{"text":"If i could give it no stars i would, overpriced greekfood that is horrible. Portion is small i still feel hungry after eating the meal. It was ok before but now its  not a good place to go to"}
{"text":"Good size portion and price.
Fast service, food tastes good and came with everything it says it has.

Agrr, they should open one in Quebec."}
{"text":"Greek Salad with chicken kabob is all I order. Delish!!! Chicken kabob sometimes a little dry. But flavour is yum. Staff could be friendlier, esp. Cashier girl. She never smiles."}
{"text":"This is for the Jimmy the Greek in the eaton centre food court close to the dundas subway station. 

The old man (who looks like the manager or boss, due to the lack of uniform) is extremely stingy on his portion (salad and potatoes portion) and was extremely rude with terrible customer service so beware."}
{"text":"Terrible food,you think with the amount of years they been in the food business they know how  to prepare food properly and train their staff.The place was only 1/4 full but the service was terribly slow,the food tasted like it was sitting in a warmer for hours and the vegetables was soft and lack any sort of texture.Wasn't my choice to come here a client said she heard about this location on the web and wanted to try it out,she was also disappointed."}
{"text":"I am fan of roast lamb shank... the lunch menu is around $11.25 and comes with rice olive greek sald, feta olives, roast potatoes and Tzatziki Sauce. Just awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great food as always. Take note that the staff will charge you for tzatziki if they don't recognize you during, unless they see you with a regular. This doesn't happen after work though. 

Pro-tip: Get the lamb dinner if you aren't seeing any clients (or if you've got mouthwash)."}
{"text":"I have to preface my review with the fact that I don't order chicken as it is my least favourite version of souvlaki, however, Jimmy the Greek in Markville Mall has changed my mind!

I hosted a birthday party this past weekend and ordered trays of chicken souvlaki based on a recommendation made by my sister. I was reluctant as pork souvlaki is the only way to go in my mind but since we already had a few pork dishes on our menu, I proceeded with ordering a few trays of chicken souvlaki.

Service: 5/5
The staff that work at this location are fantastic. Friendly, polite, attentive, and engaged.  Not at all dismissive which is refreshing in a competitive catering market. They took my order without hesitation and reviewed it with me for accuracy. When I picked up the food, everything I ordered was exactly as how I expected it to be. The trays were prepared on time, no waiting,  and ready to go.

Food: 5/5
As mentioned, I ordered chicken souvlaki. This was a Filipino party so you know there were a ton of dishes to choose from. Not wanting to waste my time on food I'm not particularly fond of, I passed on the chicken souvlaki. The eating never stops at a Filipino party and I noticed that we were down to the last tray of chicken souvlaki, wtf? I finally tried one and wish I had sooner. The chicken was perfectly cooked, no pink inside. The portions were meaty chunks of chicken, not dried out chicken croutons. The flavour of the marinade was smooth, not overpowering. It had enough flavour that I didn't even need tzatziki. I squirreled away what was left and had some for both lunch and dinner the next day. The chicken reheats perfectly without drying out.

I don't know if the food is like this during their everyday service but I would not hesitate to use them again for catering. I'm actually looking forward to the next fam-jam just so we can order trays from them again!"}
{"text":"The old man who works there is pissed off every day. Yells at customers. Throws the food about.  He's so rude! Why is he allowed to work with customers ?? If you don't like what you are doing then leave the job!"}
{"text":"They serve very fast... so fast that they don't even bother listening to your order, and they interrupt you in a rude way, before throwing the salad in your plate, and before you even have time to ask for some carrots (free item) the guy already serves another customer. I asked to add more veggies which took them five seconds and seemed to piss the hell out of the server. 

Don't go there during rush hour! Unless you are in a hurry to catch a flight on time. 
Every item is extra -and expensive. Food is barely average. But hey, you're in a food court. What do you expect? Next time, shop online and eat at home! Next customer!"}
{"text":"I went for a cheap meal since there was no dinner at home one night. Given the price I paid ($9.00) the servings were surprisingly large. In addition the food was cooked well, the chicken was soft and cooked through, the potatoes were also done well and not over or undercooked as you sometimes find fast food places do it, and finally the rice was also a similar fashion. 
I am satisfied with the service given and would come here again if I am in need of a quick meal."}
{"text":"Had Chicken Souvlaki Pita salad (substituting the salad for potatoes) and Lamb Dinner, lamb was incredibly seasoned. Potatoes have some nice spices, The chicken souvlaki was well grilled, and well spiced, The bread they used was the best pita I have ever eaten, I also had the calamari before, which was so good, that Opa! would be ashamed about their own. All the staff were friendly and cared, the prices were great, and the menu variety is good. The only hard thing to do was order, because you can't decide between all the delicious dishes!

P.S. Yelp is retarded and can't filter, don't review your favorite places, or it'll be removed. Guess Yelp needs better algorithms. Screw Yelp cause they flag everything because they are retards. I think I'll use Urban Spoon, also screw the Yelposphere I hope Yelp is hit by a DDOS daily."}
{"text":"Downgrading by a star because it was not as good this time, moussaka was like plastic and gristle.  Also the \"roasted\" potatoes were not roasted at all, but boiled, and with tough skins at that.  I guess that is what happens when you are renting at the busiest location in town, you see too many people, start to take shortcuts, and stop caring..."}
{"text":"From Dallas, TX, here in Toronto, Canada on business.. saw this place and had to try it.

-indoors
-very fast lane
-good price for food
-very food quanity they give
-greek cheese, OMG! awesomw goos with spinish bread/roll/danish..
-would go again and try gyro meal."}
{"text":"Of all the Jimmy the Greek's I've visited, this location is by far the worst. While other locations offer a choice of toppings on a side salad, the side salads here consist of a bunch of lettuce and a slice or two of tomato.

I am also upset by how rude certain staff members are. In the last little while, I've seen the same older woman raise her voice at several customers and speak in a condescending manner when something that had gone wrong on server's end was brought to her attention. For example, the woman ahead of me spoke up as they had gotten her order wrong, and said older lady replied back very rudely that she had \"requested\" the wrong menu item and that next time she is to order by saying \"____\". The customer was visibly upset, and was given no apology, but rather, met with a glare from the woman. With so many options in the food court, this is the last they will see of my business."}
{"text":"The location I went to is in the PATH at Commerce Court (Bay between Wellington and King)

Maybe I'm just spoiled from buying them in Waterloo, but there I could get two for $6 (recently they upped to two for $7) and they had much more vegetable selection.

This location served me an expensive $7.3 gyro that only had cucumber, lettuce, onion and 3 slivers of tomato in addition to meat and standard sauce. Nothing fun like beets, pickles, pineapple or other things that I fondly recall from my favourite Waterloo gyro experience.

The damn thing wasn't even wrapped right. As I opened it I was afraid it would fall open. And the vegetables were packed at the very bottom so I didn't taste them until the very end. I honestly think I could have done better if I was given 30 minutes to learn and to GIVE A DAMN.

And to top it off, the thing was probably only about 2 inches in diameter. An absolutely minuscule looking thing for $7. I have to admit it left me more full than I expected but I know that my dieting has lowered my appetite and increased my satiation sensitivity.

While the taste was indeed salty deliciousness, the meat was essential room temperature and the lack of vegetable selection left me feeling uninterested in what I was eating.

Summary:

Good
Fast
Tasty

Bad
Few selection of veggies
Cold
Expensive
Small
They don't know how to pack the wraps or hold them together properly"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Jimmy the Greek I have ever been to. The portion is sooooo small, it's almost like half of the portion size compared to other locations. The salad is not fresh as well.  We come to fantast fair often and have to eat at this food court, but we will probably steer clear of this one."}
{"text":"The Square one jimmy the greek is the stingiest location I've been to. Plain and simple they are not generous. Every other location I've been too has been plenty generous, and while it is food court fast food, it isn't the cheapest option. This location gives you very little rice and a dab of tzaziki sauce and furthermore serves their take away meals in paper cartons that get soggy and bend unable to hold the food."}
{"text":"First let me reiterate that I love Greek food. I had a craving for some chicken soulvaki and noticed there was a Jimmy the Greek in the food court of the Sheppard Center.  I ordered the chicken soulvaki dinner. The older man serving me asked if I wanted some tazziki with my dinner.  So naturally I said yes, thinking I would get a small serving of tazziki. But instead apparently he thought I wanted some chicken with my tazziki, because he walloped my entire plate with it. The chicken was extremely salty, and the rice was pretty much mush. This was the worst food I have had in quite some time.  Needless to say I have crossed this off my list of go to places."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on the weekend, and although it's not Opa, it still is good.  I had the beef wrap and it was fresh, and was made quickly. I just wish the bread tasted a bit more like Opa! 

The prices are good - you definitely get quite a bit of food for your money!"}
{"text":"I rarely leave negative reviews, but today I watched the woman behind the counter LICK HER FINGER! Then rest her gloveless hand palm down on the paper my chicken souvlaki was going to be wrapped in, and proceed to place toppings on my souvlaki without washing her hands (again - to my horror - this is after licking her finger)
  If she licks her fingers in plain sight, what goes on behind the scenes?! 
This was in the Eaton Centre. I'm sure other Jimmy The Greek's have delicious food and a good price."}
{"text":"Today I was at the Sheppard Centre location and asked for a  gyro with salad. The person in charge (a male over 50 years old) was very rude. At first I didn't understand what he was saying because of this accent, but I asked him to repeat what he was saying a few times and I think he didn't like that. Regardless, not being a native speaker myself I understand the frustration, so I continued and asked politely my order. He then started heating the bread on the flames and even when the tongs were next to him we used his hand (no gloves) to flip the bread at least 3 times. He then proceeded to serve everything, and again, with his hands and without using gloves he closed the wrap and proceeded to cash out my order (He has about to open the drawer and take the money with the same hands he was managing food). I asked him if he sanitized his hands and said I noticed he wasn't using any gloves. He didn't understand me so after a few times when he understood he said \"I didn't touch your food\" I replied \"yes, you did\" and then in a rude way he asked \"do you want it or not?\". I said no and turned away. Not only he was rude, but this is not the first time he manages food without gloves and even when I love the food, I rather not get sick."}
{"text":"The food is good, but they charge you extra for every little thing.
The hired help is mostly nice, but the manager is a complete dick."}
{"text":"We found ourselves in Yorkdale mall and we were hungry so we decided to try out the new food court on the 3rd level. If you are familiar with Yorkdale, they recently completed some renovations and moved the food court. They changed or added many new restaurants too.

We have tried two other restaurants here and weren't satisfied with the quality of the food or the value. We decided to try Jimmy the Greek because we noticed they had a lamb roast dish. Making a roast takes time because the meat needs to be \"slow-cooked\" to reduce the toughness and make it fall off the bone, plus you need the right combo of spices and veggies to bring out the flavour.

Jimmy the Greek did an awesome job in cooking our meal and we filled our bellies with roast lamb and salad to our hearts content for under $25. The value was definitely there.

If you find yourself in the food court here at Yorkdale mall, pass the rest and eat at the best. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Just ordered the Chicken Greek Salad. 

1) Who the heck puts BBQ sauce (they called it \"spicy sauce\") on a Greek salad? It ruined by $10 salad.

2) I asked for extra tomatoes and onions and got 3 stingy, paper-thin slices of tomato and about $0.02 worth of shaved onion.  Next guy gave me 2 olives - when I asked for more the first guy said no, I already had enough \"extra\" and it would be a charge for 2 more olives.  

This is just silly."}
{"text":"You can always count on this place to hook you up with tasty food court Greek food. I got the chicken Greek salad and a ginger ale. Came to $12.25 all in. The ladies that work there always remember what you got last time and the drink you want too. Fast service with a smile."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here. We had Grilled Salmon, Greek salad with  potatoes and rice.This was the only Greek food in the One Square Mall.  The salmon was overcooked and dry.
We did not have a choice of other vegetables since both rice and potatoes were carb laden. Nothing great."}
{"text":"Hurray i dont have to go to centre point!! New jimmy!!

On a sunday 4pm. Fast and good food.

Busy as heck, 24 ppl in line and they hustled, beat mcdonalds and tim hortons speed
Food was perfect

Tuesday 11am potatoes weren't fully cooked but otherwise still good product..

Cheers"}
{"text":"Yikes.  It was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a very long, long time.  I forced myself to eat it. 

I usually love greek salad.  It's usually sort of tangy and filled with delicious fresh lemon and olive oil dressing.  What I got here was a pile of iceberg lettuce with little much of anything else and a disgusting ranch-tasting white sauce as my dressing.  I've never had Greek salad anywhere with a dressing like this... so disappointing!

I'm not sure what I was expecting of the salmon, but it was terribly overcooked and had little to no flavor in it whatsoever.  It also looked like it had been sitting there for hours.

Of all the other choices in the TD Centre food court, I'm not sure why anyone would choose this.  Perhaps their other entrees are better, but please don't get the Greek salad!"}
{"text":"It was decent and the food can be much better if it was cooked fresh/warm. Also I order there Chicken Greek its like Chicken with Greek Salad."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today. There was two of us and we both ordered chicken souvlaki in a pita. Service was quick enough. 

We sat down and started to eat it. About three bites in we both said \"this isn't very good, is it?\" Typically for souvlaki we go to Astoria or port credit souvlaki. 

Now, I know it's a food court, but that shouldn't excuse mediocre food. As others have pointed out, it's not cheap. 

When they prepared the food, they had the chicken on a skewer sitting in warm water. But, and this was a point of debate during our dining, the chicken was dry.  This veritable enigma gave us plenty to talk about as we ate. 

But overall, mediocre. I had high hopes since I live closeby, but I think I will skip them in the future."}
{"text":"Say what you will about the service here, but the food is fantastic!! The best spanakopita ( spinach pie) in Toronto (yes, even better than from the bakeries in Greek Town and comparable to some of the better sit-down restaurants, great Tsatziki sauce, which is generously served with every meal, huge portions of everything and it's all so delicious. 
So what about the service? I'm not sure what people expect at a busy shopping centre take-away. 
Keep doing what you're doing, Jimmy. Me and my family will keep coming back for more, plus a baklava to take home!"}
{"text":"During a lunch rush they accidentally mixed up my order, when I tried to explain this nicely, the old lady with the white hair called me stupid. I was just hungry enough to ignore her but when I asked for extra sauce she then said \"oh, you're stupid and greedy.\" 

Classy stuff."}
{"text":"Quick Greek lunch to go. Service is quick and the food was made fresh. It's not bad for fast food if you are in a pinch and craving some Greek food."}
{"text":"Amazing salad, taste was rich, chicken was juicy and rice was satisfactory. Overall the only place I would have lunch at the suffering mall"}
{"text":"Good food....horrible customer service. And the manager with the goatee is awful. tried to explain to him the situation and instead of asking if i asked the staff to prepare the food a certain way, he accused me of not telling them and walked away. On top of that never even advised his disrespectful cashier to stop giving attitude. But hey if i were her i would be mad too....she was pretty horrible. People who aren't happy in life shouldn't work in customer service."}
{"text":"Food served totally cold.
Service totally unfriendly.
Price Expensive
Never Going Back.
Does not deserve a single star."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years now. Before they use to give you good portion. Now there cheating out a lot on the salad and rice. I finish those before the chicken. It's to bad they have gone to crap. Come on jimmy the Greek don't you guys want customers?"}
{"text":"This Jimmy the Greek vs the one at Eaton centre is stars below. Their portions are small and not enough to get me full when Eaton Centre's is very generous on their portions, its the same price, and better quality since the food is on high demand, EC's Jimmy the Greek has consistently cooked fresh food.

This place also has cups of styrofoam water in their refrigerator which is nice but it was 1 gulp of water and I felt very skeptical to ask for another cup

I ordered the vegetarian dinner and the salad was only a few bites and so was their rice (only 1 scoop the lady did). There were however about twice the amount of potatoes than normal which I thought was their way of making upfor cutting the salad and rice portion in half, but still wasn't enough to fill me up. The lady didnt offer to give me any tahini either which kinda made it look like they're tryna save on sauce lol.

Another throw my money out for unsatisfying portions @ Markville's food court :/"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Only gave me two potatoes and when I asked for more...said I needed to pay for it. 

Never going again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would. Have gone to this place twice. They are EXTREMELY stingy when it comes to giving you a decent amount of food for the price. The first time, I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner and the chicken was basically Raw!! I let them know. I didn't hear one apology. I went back yesterday to give them a second chance. My chicken was basically BLOODY!!! I took it back to them and showed it to the manager. Again, I didn't hear ONE apology. They switched my chicken with HALF the amount of gyro on the SAME salad they put the raw chicken on. I told him I want a new salad because of the Raw chicken, but according to him I either took that or paid for a new order. WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN!! Terrible business practise!"}
{"text":"It was after work and I was getting really hungry, so we decided to try Greek for a quick dinner.

Atmosphere: 4/5  Nice and tons of seating available at the crossiron mills food court; generally clean and bright.

Food: 3.5/5  I had the gyros platter which came with salad, gyros, rice, and potatoes.  I thought it was good food for the food court!  It was the first time I tried gyros - it was very tasty; maybe slightly drier than I expected, but I'm not sure if that is the way it is supposed to be.  I liked the generous portions and rice.  Potatoes were huge!  The salad was good too, but I would have liked the option of Greek salad because they only had one with iceberg lettuce and no bell peppers or lemon / oregano.  Overall I was satisfied with my meal, also because I was so hungry!!

Price: 3.5/5 Good price for portion size.

Service: 3.5/5 Efficient and friendly

Overall: 3.5/5  Overall a good option for the food court!  I would like to try their pitas too as well as their other meats."}
{"text":"overcooked rice, dry chicken, this place just didnt do it for me.  I doubt i will be back.  In fact, with so many choices around them, I'm sure i wont be back."}
{"text":"The wrost falafel pita i've ever had with stale bread and hot sauce that tastes like raw tomato sauce."}
{"text":"The chicken souvlaki dinner and lamb dinner are great. Taziki is good and portions are decent but not huge. For a food court restaurant this is as good as it gets. people need to stop complaining. Go to a greek restaurant and pay 25$ for a chicken souvlaki just because its at a restaurant and a lil better if not the same."}
{"text":"Jimmy, you changed over the years. What happened to the days when we would see the souvlaki getting grilled in front of us? Now  they're pre-made, and sit in the bin ready to put on the pita after you order. It's lost all it's freshness and the pita is stale as well. 

A customer since 1988, so many other better choices out there now."}
{"text":"3.5/5

This was my first time at Jimmy the Greek. I ordered the chicken plate. Since it is inside the mall, it is a little more busier than usual. But we didn't have to wait for a long time. The food was good, they did put less chicken than other similar restaurants. Maybe I'll give it another try at a different location."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING and RUDE STAFF ALERT. I ordered the chicken souvlaki plate this weekend. It was an early lunch and the first thing I ate all day. Within three hours I was puking my guts out and lost an entire day. I'm still recovering. I called to give them a heads up out of a genuine place of concern to inform them that they might want to check their food storage or ingredients, but the hostile and dismissive attitude I was met with inspired me to write this warning instead. Spend your dollars elsewhere. I won't be visiting any other locations."}
{"text":"I will go on record and state that one cannot find a better chicken souvlaki dinner for under $10.00 anywhere in Toronto.  I have only ever frequented the takeaway only Eaton Centre food court location and have been more than impressed with the quality of fare each and every time I visit.  The chicken is moist and cooked with love, the potatoes are roasted to absolute perfection and can be easily cut using only the edge of the flimsy plastic fork provided, they also offer a generous portion of rice and are super liberal with the feta on their Greek salad.  

I have only ever had the souvlaki, but its all I have ever needed.  Simply put  JTG makes the herculean task of navigating the pulsating throng of bodies in the Eaton Centre's subterranean food court somehow worth it."}
{"text":"Jimmy the Greek is located at the food court in Scarborough Town Centre.

Service is quick. Decided to try the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner which comes with Greek Salad, Rice and Roasted Potatoes. Total came to about $8. Unfortunately, pita bread does not come with the Souvlaki Dinner. It's $0.75 extra.

The dressing for the salad was slightly too watery. The chicken had a nice consistency but could have used more seasoning. It was a bit lacking in flavor. The potatoes were tender but also lacking in flavor. Everything tasted quite fresh. Nice portion and filling. 

A good option to have in a food court."}
{"text":"Food courts, why do you disappoint me? Two scoops of rice (come on you could do better than that) one of two pcs of potatoes to go along with it with one skewer of chicken. Good grief! Chicken was tender, but lacked flavour. $10 and change for the dinner. 

They were so bad, they gave me an idea, try it and let me know: Go to Walmart and purchase the Marc Angelo chicken souvlaki skewers. They already come marinated with bonus packs of tzatziki sauce. 8 skewers for $10.00, directions on the back for anyone to follow. Add that in an aluminum foiled tray with some potatoes and in the oven it goes. Meanwhile cook some rice on the stove and make a Greek salad. So easy even the worst cook can do it. 

So thanks Jimmy The Greek!"}
{"text":"its a decent place to eat, especially if your in a mall. If you want a heathly
alternative then go to this place..your typical soulvaki, pita, rice, greek salad, potates........you know the drill"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this Jimmy the Greek location and I was pleasantly surprised. This mall is busy- even during the week so needless to say I still had to wait about 10 minutes before getting to the front of the line. There were maybe 8 people in front of me so I would say it went by pretty fast. There are about three people working in the front. My order was the usual, a spinach cheese pie dinner. The first person put in the salad, the second person added potatoes and the spinach cheese pie and I moved to the third person to pay. Overall, it was very well organized. I asked for hot sauce and they asked me if I wanted it separately or on my food. They also gave me separate sauce. The food was hot, tasted fresh and was a great portion. Another thing that is cool about this location is that the Vaughan Mills gift cards work to purchase food here . I had one lying around for an year, so I used it to treat myself. I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"I didn't start eating at Jimmy the Greek until late last year and I have been hooked ever since. It is located in the food court in Woodbine Centre. There are other options around it like New York French Fries, Villa  Madina, KFC and many more. I have to tell you, the staff that work here have excellent customer service skills and are absolutely exceptional. I have never had staff always greet me everytime I come, it makes you feel very welcome.  

The quality and taste of the food itself is phenomenal. Definitely a healthier choice to go with when you are looking to save some calories. I literally go out of my way to come here which is over a 30 minute drive from my house. There is a wide variety of combos to choose from and all in all I have never been disappointed. Definitely worth trying when you are in the mall!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite Jimmy the Greek location. I know the same recipe is  probably used for all locations, but for some reason the food just tastes so much better here. The potatoes are super tasty and as for the salmon, wow! I think the lemon (or lime) they use in the salmon really brings out the flavour. 

Just be aware that it's located in FCP where  thousands of employees work so lunch hour (around 12-1pm) is crazy packed, making it hard to find seating. The line up also gets pretty long during this time but moves extremely fast. 

Anyways, you'll never be disappointed with the food at this Jimmy location."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Service is quick and pleasant. 
But food portions vary according to WHO scoops your food. 

Price keeps escalating though, not a fan of that. especially for the decreasing portion sizes."}
{"text":"\"YOU GOT TO KNOW HOW TO ORDER\", the waiter whispered. I went to shopping with my baby at Yorkdale centre. I didn't wear my glasses that day. The  wall ads on jimmy the Greek attracted me and I went to order there. I ordered a chicken pita, I didn't see with salad or without salad options on the wall due to the little size of the word.  When they prepare my pita, I told them I don't want olives on my salad. They asked me pita with or without salad. The I told them with salad. The another guy start complaining \"YOU GOT TO KNOW HOW TO ORDER\". So racism."}
{"text":"This place changed a lot. Cheap portions and charge extra for everything. This place is very different from other food court joints at eaton centre. Szechuan, villa medina and Thai express are better options.

The service is subpar and I've had better Greek food."}
{"text":"It is a good food, and it is a good portion. The vegetable are fresh, and the food has a really good taste. I love the chicken souvlaki."}
{"text":"There always seems to be a line up at Jimmy the Greek. Service is always quick, so there is hardly much of a wait. 

Ordered the gyros pita on the go:

The lady behind the counter asked, \"Everything?\" Of course. Included tomatoes, lettuce, tzatziki, along with my gyros wrapped tightly in the wrapper to satisfy my Greek fix. The gyros was plentiful with each bite, savoury and flavourful. The tomatoes and lettuce were fresh and the tzatziki sauce complimented the Greek experience in each mouthful.

Will definitely be back to try those yummy souvlaki!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Jimmy the Greek when I lived in BC. In fact, the location at Lougheed Mall in Burnaby, which was very close to my office, was so good that I would go 3-5 times a month for lunch. 

I was at Yorkdale Mall recently and saw that JTG had a store here, so of course I had to eat there! I ordered the same dish I always got - Chicken Souvlaki Dinner. The chicken was incredibly dry and over-cooked and the sides were just blah. Even the hot sauce wasn't very good. I used to always order extra and douse my chicken and rice with it. I guess they don't have the same suppliers here. 

I know it's just Mall food, but I've had good Mall food and this ain't it!"}
{"text":"Fast-Food is food that is prepared and served quickly. I saw a line at Jimmy the Greek and was re-thinking this. I'm so glad I waited in line. It took about 3 minutes of waiting in line till the lady called out next. 

She was working like a machine. I asked for the Gyro Plate, she quickly threw in salad, rice, potatoes and passed it along to her colleague. He confirmed that Gyro was what I wanted and topped off the entire plate with a ton of Gyro meat, salad dressing, feta cheese, olives and a huge spoon of Tzatziki. 

All that food cost me $12 something. OMG it was such a heavy take-away container. For the price you are paying it is so worth it. It's not the healthiest of meals but it is fucking delicious. I cut up some potato and gyro, fork a bunch of rice and tzatziki and the combination of flavours is great. 

I was full for hours and very very satisfied. This is a sweet deal and don't forget it is fast food! 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this location. I know it's in a mall and it is a fairly busy mall compared to other malls but their system does not work. I have been here twice in a span of 2 years and clearly nothing has changed. The food is great but I honestly did NOT KNOW that the rice and potatoes are chicken based.... how is that a vegetable platter?! This franchise is NOT VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY AT ALL. The line at this place was ridiculously long and it moved very slowly. I mean all the lines at the other fast food places were busy and long as well everyone got their food fast and the lines moved quickly unlike Jimmy the Greek. This line moved super slowly even though they're good is premade and cooked... so I don't understand the reason for the hold up?! They need new workers who are fast and efficient cause the rest of the fast food stores seemed to work much better than them."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 5 for a fast food place in a mall, but there is one area that could be better.

Service is always good and quick. I always order the pork plate to go and I guess because most people order chicken, the pork sits there for a while. As a result, it is sometimes dry or a bit tougher to eat than the chicken. It's still manageable though so I always still get it.

Price is fair for the portion size because I always feel comfortably satisfied after eating there. I just wish there were more locations closer to me."}
{"text":"Beef Tenderloin Souvlaki so tasty I hate to call it mall food. It was cooked to order & they asked how I wanted it. That takes mall food to another level."}
{"text":"I Used to come here often, and order their chicken with salad meal but they are very cheap with their portions. They provide Very few veggies and cheese with the meal order and the manager is very rude."}
{"text":"Sunday, March 18th. My boyfriend took me to Crossiron Mall to go shopping. We had a wonderful time at the mall. By lunchtime, we went to the food court in Crossiron Mall. I had the Greek food at Jimmy the Greek. It was a small fast food restaurant. There are only two locations in Calgary. It was my first time having food in this place. I have ordered Calamari Meals, which included Calamari, Greek Salad, Rice, and roasted potatoes. The price of the food was around $12.50.  The food came out the kitchen, was fast. The food was fresh and well cooked with a large portion. With the dressing, the taste of the food was awesome. The calamari was very fresh. I had a great experience at Crossiron Mall Jimmy the Greek."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy the Greek, but this location didn't cut it. The employees were efficient and polite. The food, however, was their downfall. I ordered the roasted chicken dinner, and the chicken was mushy. The salad, potatoes, and rice were average, but the meat was very unappetizing. I'm a regular at another Jimmy the Greek location and I noticed that the prices at Fairview are different. I'm not sure if that's because the prices at my usual location are lower, or if the prices at Fairview are higher. Either way, the mushy chicken wasn't fun, so I wouldn't recommend the roasted chicken leg dinner here."}
{"text":"I personally like the food here. I get the chicken souvlaki meal which is served with salad, potatoes and rice. Total comes up to less than $12. Very filling meal as well, can be enough for two people depending on how much u can eat. I like how the potatoes are a bit tangy. I'm also a fan of creamy dressings and sauces so I really like the white sauce. I chose not to have any of the hot sauce today. If u don't really like white meat though you won't like the souvlaki. It's definitely flavored but not the juiciest. I don't think it's an issue when u eat it with the sides. Food is served very quickly as well."}
{"text":"Very rude owner. Usually these places are fine. However, this location is a huge exception. They skimp out on every single ingredient (I.e., garlic sauce). If you ask to swap rice for extra potatoes they say \"not getting rice is your choice\" despite other locations being fine with it. Worst service I have ever had from Jimmy the Greek. To top it all off a group of us were there and afterwards one of my friends boyfriend's found a cockroach in his gyro... Seriously???"}
{"text":"The quality of this location has decreased drastically. Recently my sister and I ordered a Chicken Souvlaki Dinner Platter and a Vegetarian Dinner Platter to go and were so disappointed in the amount of salad given in each. If we are paying more than $10 for each meal, I would hope that they could provide us with at least half of the container filled with salad, and green lettuce at that unlike the yellow and bitter core of the lettuce we received."}
{"text":"The pork souvlaki dinner always has a pool of oil on the bottom. Definitely not fun eating the salad that's been sitting on the bottom. I always seem to get the end of the cabbage as part of my salad and obviously don't eat that. The souvlaki has been sitting around too long and has is hard. They have large platters of food but there wasn't anyone there on a weekday evening.

Be sure to check out the touchscreen displays in the mall for a free $2 coupon to any restaurant in ExpressEatery before ordering."}
{"text":"Their chicken is amazing. Very tender, and the aroma and the spices used is just right. However it is a bit pricey tho."}
{"text":"Went here on a morning walk and grabbed the classic breakfast.  Good bargain breakfast.   Ate it out on the outdoor patio overlooking the green space on a warm sunny morning.  Not so bad."}
{"text":"Got the beef/lamb gyro dinner with rice and salad.

The rice and salad was good but i found the gyro a bit too dry.

Good service, and nice restaurant, probably will try souvlaki if i go back."}
{"text":"Limp lettuce, boring sauce and what tasted like day old souvlaki.
I will not try this spot again."}
{"text":"Very very rude manager that told me
To be quiet. He was confused about who was next and when I answered him, he didn't like it. He told me to move along--he's right I am moving right along to an eatery with decent manners. I will not be back here again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Jimmy the Greek for years, and now that I work in the area I go much more frequently than before. Unfortunately, their portion sizes have decreased substantially from years past, and their prices have increased by 30% since 2006. 

Aside from that, what can I say about one of the dozens of booths in the Scarborough Town Centre, it's packed non-stop from 11:00-7:00 but it is lively. The food itself is still pretty fresh and clean, so standards haven't dropped off. It's nice to get away from some of the major fast food chains and try something different, and my friends always appreciate that.

Recommendation:
-Spinach Pie Dinner"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken salad- chicken is cold, over cooked and bland, all the chicken breast were soaked in the oily broth and the chopping board they used was very dirty. 
The simplest salad ends up to be very disappointing. 

Will not buy cold chicken in food court again. 
 
Now I know why there's always a line at grilled it up"}
{"text":"Don't expect much from this foodcourt stand. Food is average at best, got the souvlaki plate, meat is dry, and tough, tzatziki is bland, \"roasted potatoes\" taste more like mashed since its been sitting there for too long in the liquid. Don't worry about getting too much food, there is a manager watching every worker like a hawk, they will pass your plate back down the line to remove an extra olive. Do not bother asking for extra anything - i asked for extra tzatziki sauce and that just means the worker slaps it onto your plate harder, save your self the hassle, glaring eyes and rudeness by going elsewhere."}
{"text":"On April 16, 2014.  I went to York-dale and went to the food court and seen this store and felt like Greek!  I have the Dinner (chicken, pottos, meat, salad). 

Had a set and was eating my food when it was like not hot at all it was more like a little worm.  I ate it any-whys cause i was very hungry.  

The serves was not very good no smiles or recommended anything.  Then again it was more high-school kids and they give a vibe or not wanting to be their!!  

Cost:  about normal for other places! 

Over all i would not do Jimmy at york-dale.  Cold food and then later that night i had tummy trouble!  so i would not go back at all!"}
{"text":"I feel strange having to write a review for a place commonly seen foodcourts across the country however give where credit is due. This branch in Markville mall's food court at the time of our visit had been very pleasant and accommodating. In fact choosing a meal was as satisfying as having the meal itself. She had answered my questions nicely with a smile, none of that one syllable yes! no! or if your really unlucky a blank stare you normally get from foodcourt servers. With such little choices, Jimmy the greek is definitely at one my often 3s as places to eat in CF Markville Mall."}
{"text":"This Jimmy the Greek is located in the food court of the Sheppard Centre concourse. For fast food, it's pretty good. I ordered the lamb dinner. I was expecting lamb shishkabob or something. But I actually got the lamb leg with bone in, along with the standard greek salad, rice & potatoes. It's a filling meal. With the bone in, it makes eating a little sloppy. But other than that, I would rate it a medium yummy factor. Customer service wasn't much since it's just slap the food on the plate & pay. But they did give me a good portion of food & were quick about it. Not bad for food court fare!"}
{"text":"This is located in the food court of the mall. You usually can't expect much from a fast food joint, much less one in a mall's food court. But this was decent food with good portions & prices. I had the salmon dinner which came with greek salad, rice & potato. Very filling. But I actually ate this for lunch & didn't eat dinner later on so I was fine. These guys have their line assembly down pat. Watching them was kind of interesting as it was like clockwork. Food tasted good & it was fresh too. $11.00 including a drink."}
{"text":"Chicken souvlaki salad is awesome, a little pricey for the size though, about $9. The pitas are also very good. They sometimes go a little heavy on the dressing, but go for the hot sauce, it's not that spicy but very flavorful. 

Been here many times for lunch and never disappointed. It's down in the path, get's super busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"I went to Yorkdale mall yesterday and I was so hungry@ I order 2 chicken souvlaki and guess what I see in salad????"}
{"text":"Went here last week for a calamari dinner. Everything, except the calamari, was delicious. Calamari was not good and not worth buying."}
{"text":"This location of Jimmy the Greek is located in the Eaton's Centre Urban Eatery.  There is always huge line at lunchtime but the service is fast and friendly.  My favourite is the chicken Greek - a grilled chicken breast on top of a huge Greek Salad.  At $9.59 (including tax) it is pricey (hence the four star review) but it is low carb, filling and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great reliable souvlaki dinners. Good flavours although today the server dropped potato pieces on the counter while serving and he picked it up and still served it. Kinda gross."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a healthy dinner after the drive from Edmonton. Had the Greek salad & chicken souvlaki-yummy!! Just what i needed to fill my tummy!!"}
{"text":"Very cheap and their meat is not fresh!! Ordered the lamb shank and it was dry and yesterday's meat. This will be the last time I will come here."}
{"text":"I thought this was excellent Greek food especially for the mall. I ordered a chicken souvlaki dinner plate. The potatoes were big and perfectly cooked, sometimes you get a slightly crispy edge and it's so good. And I loved the lemon flavor.

Chicken was good he was cooking it on the grill so I had to wait. I already paid and I wanted more tszaziki but nope. $.75 extra. Maybe they are cutting costs. It's a shame because places like this should give you an extra dollop of yogurt if you wish. I know times are tight. But Greek people are generous people. So this attitude doesn't go with the restaurant. I forgave it.

Salad was fresh and tasted really good. Fresh cucumbers, a nice dressing over Romain lettuce and a few tomatoes and onions with three black olives. Rice was good too. The spinach and cheese pie looked amazing as well. Maybe next time I'll get that."}
{"text":"For the price you pay, it's way worth it! I always feel full after eating it and it's also delicious. The service was good and the line went by really quickly as there was an assembly of people working. If you don't want to spend so much but want a big portion, this is the place for you (or at any other Jimmy the Greek locations)."}
{"text":"This jimmy isn't like the others. I was used to getting Jimmy at square one with their small portions and watered down dressing so I didn't expect much. BUT after trying this location it is substantially better. They recently changed owners after the renovation and it's been great since. Food is a good portion and is fresh and for a fair price. Definitely has become a favourite food court location of mine. Would definitely recommend trying it this time around. 

Food 5/5
Value 5/5 
Overall 5/5 

Haven't had a poor experience here yet and I've been here multiple times in the last month (I work in the mall lol)"}
{"text":"There is one of this in the food court at First Canadian Place at York and Adelaide.
It always has a big line-up at lunch.
Their roasted chicken and chicken souvlaki are the most selling items.
I prefer roasted chicken more though.The chicken is very juicy and so well done.
You can get the roasted chicken dinner for 7.99.
It has rice,lettuce salad,potato and a big roasted chicken piece.
If you don't want rice,you can ask them to put more salad instead.
Sometimes I buy only the roasted chicken piece for 4 bucks.
They also put garlic and tzatziki sauce if you ask them to.But I have noticed ,some of the servers  put a lot of it and 
that ruins my meal sometimes.
Overall,a very good and filling meal for lunch."}
{"text":"This is the third time I'm eating on this franchise, but I've never been so rudely treated as I was on this one....I forgot to say that my plate was a meal and when I asked for the rude attendant to make it a meal he told me that THIS TIME he would do it but I need to learn how to order PROPERLY, because I didn't say the word meal!!!! When I told him that I didn't know about that, he pointed to the sign and said that I needed to read it better next time....well my money is not going to this place again I'll tell you that"}
{"text":"I don't understand how can the manager of this place, who was serving people at the time can't just be nice and answer a simple question from a customer. I asked if some dish called calamari, which obviously I don't recognize, was a chicken or a fish...he was completely rude with me, answering that it was clearly a fish if it had that name...come on, don't he know we live in a multicultural country? I've never heard that name. How come you can't just answer my question with a simple smile to yourface? I was going to eat and pay for a meal at your restaurant and now I will never come back, just because of your rudeness reply to a simple question. If you think you can be rude just because you've got customers coming, you should think twice and start treating your customer better! I DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL!!!!"}
{"text":"Dinner for 2 and bottle of Ginger ale is $24.56. They have no taste what so ever. Also they forgot to put napkin on my tray.

Not happy"}
{"text":"Really tasty Greek food in the Happy Trails Food Court.  Had the Gyros and salad plate.  The salad consists of romaine lettuce leaves, tomato slices, feta cheese, 3 olives and that wonderful Greek salad dressing.  The Gyros wrap was so delicious - that lovely garlicky sauce just makes the whole wrap!  The wrap is so soft. The gyros meat was so tender.  The Gyros wrap and salad really compliment each other.  Oh, don't forget the hot sauce!  Adds a hint of spice to the gyros!  The price was really reasonable, too, $6.99!!

Accepts credit cards."}
{"text":"I WOULD GIVE ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE. This location is actually REVOLTING. So disgusting. The food looks actually disgusting af. So messy and dirty.

First of all the bitch standing at the salad area was rude af. I asked for a Gyro plate and shes like ya.. u can move up. And I was like ok well i didn't make my salad yet. And shes like \"ok next time say u want to make ur salad w other stuff.\" Bitch... which person just eats lettuce, of course i want olive and feta, of course you guys are stingy af and trying to get away with it. Every other location asks. 

The spinach cheese pie was burnt, the gyro was disgusting, still had cartilage on it. I almost threw up when I bit into it. The potatos were mashed up, and the rice was like a spoon. 

Service is terrible, food is disgusting, I was rushed, they just quickly want to get you to the check out. Worst food I've ever had. Worst service. Needs to be shut down because looks like everyone else hates it too."}
{"text":"Those who know what authentic Greek food is wouldn't consider this food good.  

First mistake Jimmy makes is their Greek salad had iceberg lettuce, GREEK SALAD NEVER USES ICEBERG LETTUCE, in fact, Greek salad never has lettuce in it.  A true Greek salad consists of sweet peppers, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, feta, kalamatas, olive oil and Greek oregano, salt and lemon (optional) to taste.

A stack of iceberg, 2 measly tomatoes, two measly cucumber slices and one olive does not a Greek salad make!  REALLY!?  And the dressing although good, is not a traditional greek dressing, its more like a westernized Kraft version of Greek dressing.  

My chicken souvlaki platter was barely worth two stars; the only redeeming thing to the weirdly textured chicken in a strange broth that was pre-cooked (mistake #2!), and crunchy rice (mistake #3) was the tatziki and bread, which I paid $1.50 extra for.  

$11.00 for a barely passable lunch.  Stick with Taco Bell a few stalls down and save your self a 5er.  At least you will get a drink there with your combo.

Thats 3 strikes Jimmy, you're out brother."}
{"text":"Portion size for the price was perfect. Ending up only being able to finish about half the plate, a testament to the size, not the quality. The food was good. Had the souvlaki plate, no complaints at all."}
