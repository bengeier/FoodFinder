{"text":"The burgers are amazing and ridiculously reasonable! The staff is friendly and attentive. The place is super clean! They do everything right at Players! Good drinks, great lunch specials and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Love the crowd most nights, always someone to entertain ya at least...One can come into this bar alone, but never feel alone.  With darts, pool and best of all--ping-pong, it's hard to go wrong.  

The only reason I do NOT like this place are the bartenders at night.  They seem quite sociable with all the guys, but if you're a single lady in here don't expect good service from them.  I walked out one night after not being acknowledged (she looked at me when I walked in and immediately sat down) or served within 15 minutes of arriving, and it was not a busy night.  The prices of the drinks seem to change as well.  I order the same rail vodka drink everytime, but I get back different change, even from the same bartender in the same night!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Madison. Try to go whenever I can. All the sandwiches are great. Daily specials and brews make the trip!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite bars. It's definitely got a neighborhood vibe, but it's chock full of some of the friendliest staff you'll ever meet. And can we talk about the burgers for a minute? They are wonderful. One of the best in Madison, in my opinion. There's a light, airy bun and a perfectly greasy burger with your choice of cheese and grilled or raw onions. I work nearby and it takes every chubby bone in my body to stop me from going there every day. Food is ready fast, and you'll always get a smile. Cash only, but there's an ATM. (The ATM is also super-speedy, which is odd and exciting. It's the little things)."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like anything special from the outside and was a bit reluctant to go in, but I'm thrilled I did. Honestly used to go here every weekend when I lived in the area. Perry makes one of the best burgers in town. I think they said they get their meat fresh from the willy st co-op every day. So delicious. Then I'd stay and fill up on relatively cheap drinks and catch the Brewers or Bucks game. They have a ton of tv's along with pool, ping pong, and darts. Perfect place if you want some good food and a place to watch the game."}
{"text":"The food was good as usual. Totally worth it. Unfortunately, some drunk lady wanted to bash our president. My buddy was having none of that.  To make a long story short, we were kicked out.  This lady went absolutely nuts and we got the shaft.  I just wish people were more accepting and not so rude."}
{"text":"If I feel like grabbing a good bar burger this is easily my first choice!! They are juice monsters and the bartender's are always very nice,"}
{"text":"Had the deep fried donuts as an appetizer. They were really good. Plenty of cold beer and good \"outdoorsy\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"When I went in for the first time, I had no expectations , figured it would be just another bar burger . Wrong, DELICIOUS  I have been ordering carryout occasionally every since.   I agree with Mzz Julia's review .... GREAT employees too. MARY very nice, adorable and professional. Mary's  deliberate attention to quality of food and customer service provided initially had my friend and I thinking she must be the Manager/Owner.  We later  met the Manager who is very nice also and sat and talked to us  as we ate dinner and looked at purses on our I pad."}
{"text":"Typical Wisconsin bar with bar food. Burgers and fries, and a fun burger menu with a lot of different combinations. There is a huge bar to sit around, high top tables, and also many pool tables and dart boards. Enjoyed shake of the day too. The staff was very friendly and quick service. Cash only here. I tried the lotza motza burger which was good. It has fried mozzarella sticks, garlic sauce, and pepperoni.  Was not the best burger I've ever had but it was definitely good and better than average bar food. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the bar, our group had fun."}
{"text":"As Wisconsin taverns go, Players is true blue, or today-- a Badgers game day-- Dead Red.

Burgers are Class A, top notch. We split the Bacon Blue Burger medium rare. Not only was it an ample half- pounder, but it was balanced between the power of bacon and blue, and the raw onion, lettuce and tomato. And it was actually cooked MR!

No foodie gentrification hipster pretension here. Also it wasn't all stocky white people. It was stocky people representing several ethnicities.

Beer was local and crafty. And the cherry/ red bull crap was flowing too.

Service was warm and efficient. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I have been here for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night drinks. It does not disappoint. Really solid bar food, including the chicken. Stiff drinks served in mason jars.  Look past the odd name and swing by."}
{"text":"Players is a great place for a burger. Really good food at a good price, and great service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Perfect spot to come to if you have laundry to do since the laundromat is right across the street, but they're also the perfect spot because not only do they sell beer, but they have amazing food! I typically like ordering whatever burger special of the week they have going on. I ordered a chili cheese burger sometime ago and it was delicious. If you're feeling wild try their Lotza Motza burger that includes two mozzarella sticks, garlic sauce, pepperoni, and of course, lotsaaa mozzarella. Their meat is delivered fresh daily from the Jenifer Street Market and their buns are from the Madison Sourdough bakery, which you can taste the freshness. Today I ordered their Mardi Gras special burger, which was topped with peppers, andouille sausage, micro shrimp slaw, and Cajun sour cream. The andouille sausage paired excellently; this is definitely one of the best burgers I have had. I really hope to see this on the menu again! I'll be craving it real soon. 

Even though the bar area can get crowded at times, they have lots of seating nearby to accommodate. There are also two pool tables in the middle of the bar. Def a locals favorite!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, we were told they had the best burgers in Madison. Food here was amazing and the atmosphere was incredible. They have ping pong table and pool tables and a dart board, good beer selection also"}
{"text":"Great place for a great burger ... friendly owner/cook and burger is always perfect to my liking ! One of Madison's top Burgers"}
{"text":"So I've been hearing this joint has one of the \"Best\" burgers in town. I'm generally reluctant to order a bar burger - they are generally frozen and then cooked to well done. Not at Players - hand pattied in view of the customer. Meat is from the Jennifer Street Market - Right around the corner. 

You want your burger rare - Fine... It's rare... Sha- Freaking- Zam! I think perhaps the only Burger Joint in town that is capable of cooking a burger properly to order. 

Sandwiches come with pub chips - you can upgrade to fries for a buck... Other stuff like onion rings for $2.  The sides are frozen and then dropped in the fryer. But you are here for the burgers - they are fresh, as is everything on them. The tomato on my burger was actually tasty. My only complaint is the burgers could use a more robust bun... But the fact that Players can properly cook a burger makes this discretion forgivable.

So go to this locals joint blue collar bar - have a beer, get the drink special and order a freaking burger!"}
{"text":"This place is a great post game stop for Badger fans. Love it here! Great dive bar atmosphere was great food and super cold fresh beer. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Affordable drinks, good food, solid juke box, but what really makes Players stand out is the staff. They genuinely care about the patrons and enjoy what they do. Christmas gifts for the regulars, coat drives, raffles, babysitting the stuff you leave there when you're drunk (guilty), Players has your back. There are a lot of places to drink, eat, and chat, but here you know you're welcome."}
{"text":"The Players club is the BEST!!!! Wendy, the bartender, is the bomb!!!!! Definitely the best burgers ever!!!  Love love love this crew!!! It's a must do if you are in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"A comedic collection of hipsters and hobos, peppered with semi-pro poker players and and a hanoi-jane pissing target in the urinal.  Swing by the Stop-N-Go on the way out and grab a Sparks.  Quite real."}
{"text":"Great bar for Packer games. Free shots for touchdowns. Pot Luck on Packer sunday. Bring a dish to pass."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great. Super sports bar. Service was excellent! As long as your not focused on the food. No credit cards either."}
{"text":"So, so, so good. I am sitting here having a rare cheddar burger with the works and made with fresh ground Jenny Market beef (and using their free wi-fi, obvs). Also: THE BEST CHEESE CURDS. FACT. The staff are familiar faces, friendly, competent. Better bartenders than any overpriced, stuck-up hipster joint downtown, that is also a fact. Tons of TVs for your sports watching enjoyment, good jukebox, eclectic regulars (including yours truly, lol). Get in here."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm new to the area and being an eagles fan I have to go out for most of the games! I'm so glad I discovered this place! Everyone is super friendly and the drinks and food are great! Perfect little sports bar! This will be my little sports home for the time that I am here. Only con (not a problem for me) is it's cash only"}
{"text":"Went there Friday night and ordered the jalapeno popper burger. It wasn't all that great,  not sure what went wrong because I love cream cheese and I would have thought adding it to a burger would be awesome but it really had no flavor. I'll try another burger next time I go,  the hamburger itself was nice. I will say that the onion rings were the best I have ever had and I highly suggest paying extra for them."}
{"text":"Great staff!!  Sunday breakfast is best bar breakfast around!!  Asked for a special order and they served it up perfectly!!  Will be a regular spot for us on Sunday mornings!!"}
{"text":"I really dig this place. They are really fun with lots of parlor games and posters from the nineties of girls in Bud Light gear. It's definitely more of a townie bar, so the clientele is pretty interesting: think people who prefer beer to their spouses. The sign says 'great food', which is true as long as you like fried foods that don't have particularly much to do with fresh food."}
{"text":"I love Players!!! For a while, I was one of the \"regulars\" for sure. I haven't been in as often lately, but that's not their fault. You know how life and work and bills and adulting get in the way of things, LOL. 

Anyway -- I love Players. All the bar tenders are amazing. The bar itself recently got an interior upgrade, it looks great! The food is outstanding! (try the Buzzy sandwich, or any of the burgers, the burger of the week, it's ALL good!) 

Every Wednesday they have a drawing. You pay a dollar into the pot, if a winner is not drawn it rolls over. I even WON once! Hello free money! 

 Players also participates in local charity events which is pretty darn cool. The coat drive last winter was a huge success and a ton of fun!"}
