{"text":"I've been to Macy's several times now and I think it's finally time to give this place a review. 

I ordered the Alaskan Halibut fish and chips with a mushroom and chicken noodle soup. Once  the soup came, i had a quick taste, the soup had a very strong flavour. Soon, the main entree arrived.

When the fish and chips arrive, you could tell that the fish was not overly oily and  the batter was thin and crisp.  So, I cut off a piece of the fish to try... Thinking about this now is making my mouth water! the fish was very moist and the quality of the fish was top notch. The batter itself was light, accenting the flavour of the fish rather than overpowering the natural flavours. To further enhance the taste, I squeezed the lemon and enjoyed the light and refreshing fish.

The fish was sooo delicious that I ended up going back the next day to get another serving."}
{"text":"Best weekend breakfast around, as you can tell by the full house of satisfied customers. Large made-to-order meals served with a smile. Owners & staff are simply wonderful. We've been eating here well over ten years and many others even longer."}
{"text":"Very family friendly. Had the club and the steak au jus both were really great and fresh and well priced. You could tell they were homemade in house. The owners came by and chit chatted so nice and hospitable. We are looking forward to coming back for breakfast apparently they have a mean eggs Benny."}
{"text":"I can't believe they closed! They were the best fish-and-chip joint around!"}
{"text":"Wow, stumbled upon this diner and so glad we did! Very friendly staff and the food was so fresh and delicious. I ordered the eggs benedict and they were so good, the home fries you could tell weren't reheated..crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My husband got the hot turkey club as per the waitress' recommendation and absolutely loved it..and he's not usually one to like turkey. They make the turkey in house, not prebought and sliced. Will definitely come back here as the food was more fresh and flavourful than cora's. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good old school Diner ...great for breakfast after a night of partying ! Menu is a bit on the pricey side even the breakfast menu ..but the quality of the food shows for it . It's pretty quiet as its full of Old People yes i said old people  but like i said that's good for a morning with a hangover ..besides reminds you of being a kid after a night of drinking hiding the alcohol smell from Grandma and Grandpa !"}
{"text":"Macy's is closed. 

Wimpy's will operate at this site

I truly enjoyed every meal at Macy's. Staff were excellent. So was food. 

I'm sorry Macy's closed."}
{"text":"Have to agree with reviewer below. Fish and Chip Fridays are a big hit. Large portions (but not cheap). Everything is home made and top quality."}
{"text":"I'd say it's alright. 3.5 stars.

Gets points for seemingly being one of the only delis in Mississauga (why?).

it has anything you'd want from a deli- corned beef, ruben, smoked meat sandwiches.

Feels kind of old...not in a good way."}
