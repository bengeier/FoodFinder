{"text":"Consistently solid experience. Americanized Chinese food at a decent price. And they are open until around 11:00 during the week. It's my solid go-to spot when I need Chinese food."}
{"text":"They give you a good quantity of food for a very cheap price, but the food is so bland and poor that it is just not worth it unless your primary goal is to save a few dollars. We ordered several dishes. In all of them the meats (chicken, beef, shrimp) were overcooked or old - either way they were dry, tough and tasteless. The rice tasted old as well - very dry. The vegetables were decent and everyone in our group seemed to like the Broccoli, I think because it tasted reasonably fresh and was overcooked for a chinese place, which means it is regularly cooked for other places, so it ended up tasting decent. 

As a bonus they gave us free egg rolls and fortune cookies. That was a very nice touch but unfortunately the quality of the food is just too low for it to be redeemed by their freebies and low prices."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by the lunch buffet. Small selection and over priced compared to what is available next door at Harris Teeter. But I find the regular meals are great. Food is prepared fresh and is very tasty. Good portion size for the money.  A great place to get take out."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chicken Teriyaki ever. They grill it right in front of you. Most Chinese restaurants deep fry it and it usually comes out dry and old. This place grills it fresh, and it comes out tender. If you don't try anything else here, you've got to try the Teriyaki sticks. The beef Teriyaki is ok, but not as good as Chicken. I usually get their tofu and shrimp with mixed vegetables. Their brown sauce is not the best I've had, but it's decent. 5 stars on the Teriyaki, 3 stars on their dishes. Their food is so cheap I have to add another star. This is a five star Chinese restaurant for me."}
{"text":"disgusting: 
lady was prepping food in the dining room today. totally inappropriate. there should be proper sanitation involved. and isn't that why you have a kitchen

update: she literaly dropped a green bean on the ground another came by and put it back in the bucket!!!"}
{"text":"I had a harrowing experience today at China Town Chinese restaurant near Harris teeter in Steele Creek. Last night we ordered take out, and when we opened the bag at home I noticed a huge amount of thick black grease all inside the wanton soup container. It was disgusting. I figured it was an innocent mistake so I decided to take it back there today and ask for a refund. Well, I never expected the treatment I got when I walked in with the soup. The workers all gathered around & began shaking their heads denying that it came from their place, even though I gave them the receipt. They kept saying \"this didn't come from us\" and \"we didn't do that!\" They never apologized, but in the end I got the refund. It killed them to give it to me. All I can say is never again."}
{"text":"Take out Chinese food on the cheap! How can you go wrong? 

This place is good, clean and consistent - as I'm a regular they can even remember what I order when I call in.

There is also a restaurant area where it looks like there may be a lunch buffet - I don't think I'd eat there but it makes for great takeout."}
{"text":"We were originally going to cook Friday night, but it got late by the time we were heading home, so I decided to pick up some food from China Town on the way.  

I went in and there were two people actually eating at the restaurant, the rest were in line or waiting for their take out.  It seems like that is the thing there as the phone was constantly ringing for more orders.  They had a buffet, but I'm not sure when it is set up as it was not during the time I went, which shocks me with it being a Friday night. 

I ordered my normal, you got it, sesame chicken.  Also ordered beef and broccoli.  With the number of people waiting and the calls coming in, the order was ready in 5 minutes.  That's great, but should that be questionable???  Maybe the whole Americanized Chinese part.  Both entrees were good and I like that they had a little extra sauce for putting on rice. They also made for good leftovers - not dried out!

I would go back here for convenience, but I still have some other Chinese places that I just like a lot more, so I will reserve those for the 4 and 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is cheap the food is good and you can look into the kitchen to see that it is clean. My five stars is not to say that you need to round up the neighbors and tell everyone \"you gotta try this place\" but personally I only like 2 types of buffets, Chinese and brunch. The food is pretty good. They have big fat egg rolls, and no one gets sick. Plus with it being in steele creek the clientele aren't bad either. What else can you ask for out of a 6 dollar lunch?"}
{"text":"Used to be 4 stars in my book for Chinese takeout for years. Also really close to my house. The quality & freshness of the food has declined. Knowing that every place can have an off night, we ordered from them a couple more times with the same disappointing results."}
{"text":"Ordered take away via JustEat.ca and I will never order from China Town again.  This used to be our go to place for Chinese Food, but the last few years, they've just gone down hill.  They charged me $44.46 through JustEat but the receipt says $35.10 (stapled to the bag, and I prepaid the order online via PayPal, so I was charged $44.46).  Then, they didn't pack the whole order.  Because we live ONE BLOCK outside their delivery area, I had to drive all the way back.  Not impressed.  They did nothing to rectify the issue and had no reason for the discrepancy in the price I was charged and the receipt on the bag.  Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Ever since the last review. I still go here. And they have improve soooo much. Still that quick place you can go get those Chinese craving satisfy. Their food have alway been consistent. Place a phone order and you can get it in 10 mins no matter no big or small the order is!! Ppl must try this!"}
{"text":"Never ever will I order from here again. They tried to overcharge us when we arrived to pick up our food and then argued that their prices \"go up and down like Harris Teeter next door...and today they are up\"!  So the prices we saw online AND on the menu in the restaurant were different(and less) from what they wanted to charge us.  Who does this!? Who changes the menu prices as they see fit,  person to person or day to day?! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I think its a great place to eat and ive gone here for like more than 7 years and it still is fresh great chinese food !"}
{"text":"Don't you love it when you have to beg the restaurant to put food out on a buffet? Whenever I go here, the place is decently busy but they always seem to have a problem with having enough food out on their buffet. Everytime a tray of food is brought out, it's such a tiny portion that its usually emptied out within seconds by all the hungry customers! If you're going to run a buffet and expect people to come back, AT LEAST have enough food there for your paying customers!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here instead of our regular place because it was easy to order off of Just Eat. We ordered many dishes and it was incredibly bland. The only dish we all seemed to enjoyed was the Sesame Chicken all else was a bust. Nothing tasted like it really should, was off, and just lacked. It was fine but never again. They gave us free egg rolls which was nice but not enough to make up for the other plain dishes. The other review is incredibly accurate and reiterates how we all felt about our many dishes."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this restaurant the food was not that great people go there because it's a buffet. I asked for water with my meal not because I was cheap but because I had just finished some drinks and I didn't really need anymore sugar or anything so I couldn't find the waterspout I took a half a glass of unsweetened tea so that I could have something to swallow my food with what I had finished my meal the woman came over and in front of the entire restaurant told me you didn't pay for that tea you all me $1.94 and I wasn't trying to get away with free beverage I just didn't know where to find the water and when I told her that she showed me where the spout was and told me I had toPay her for the tea I drink I gave her two dollars told her to please keep the change and that she didn't have to worry about my business ever again. That's not how you handle the situation when a customer is in the restaurant you can say something without embarrassing him in front of the whole entire place there was no reason for it I wasn't trying to steal her tea."}
{"text":"So this is the closest Chinese place to our house and we love our chinese food. I read all these reviews and it kind of scares me, but we have not had any problems here so far and we have gotten take out about a dozen times. I normally get the vegetable lo mein and it is not bad ( also not the greatest I have had). My husband usually gets different things each time, he likes them and we have had no problems with it. It def is not the best chinese food we have had. I am not a huge fan of the spring rolls, they are really just filled with cabbage and that is it.  We always get take out and they always have it ready when we get there. If you are looking for chick chinese take out this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki is good. Ordered cashew chicken, hot and spicy beef and Kung Pao chicken. Sauces were extremely bland - no flavor and zero spice in the hot and spicy beef. The beef was slimy and had the texture of pre-chewed food. Do yourself a favor and go to Masa right next to the Bi-Lo across the street."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, just tasty/cheap take-out Chinese food.  My favorite in the Steele Creek area"}
{"text":"I truly want to give this place a zero rating. At one time, this place was a 3  but after this carry out order, I will no longer eat here. The owner does not care about your concerns.  When I called to discuss the errors,  she always got loud and talked over me, not trying to hear my concerns. I asked for a printout of my receipt with a breakdown of what I paid for  and I received  generic receipt of just the overall charges. She even hung up on me when I called to discuss my order discrepancies. Never again will I eat here."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Every time we order \"10 minutes\" is the reply. We enjoy the crab Rangoon and the sesame chicken combo the most. Try it out."}
{"text":"Cashier was very pleasant.  Meal was mostly awful. Pork fried rice was good. Steamed dumplings soggy and not done. Orange chicken tasted like bitter moldy orange peel. 

Won't return."}
{"text":"Extremely Americanized Chinese food, but that's perfectly cool. It's what we like!

I ordered a spicy chicken, which comes with either pork fried rice or white rice and a spring roll. Well cooked but not very spicy, but still a lot of chicken in there and a lot of meat in the fried rice. A packet or two of hot mustard brought out the flavor and we were rocking along.

They have a buffet table set up in the middle of the dining room. I have no idea when they have a buffet.

They're located in the shopping plaza in the north west corner of Steele Creek and South Tryon, next to the Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"The Horror...The Horror. I have had some bad Chinese food in the past, but this place takes the cake.
The 90 sanitation rating should have acted as a warning, but I felt adventurous. 
The hot sour soup tasted like it was made with bleach. The chicken wings were not chicken, but some kind of amphibian. The low mien was swimming in 30 weight motor oil. The cat and broccoli was tasteless and the egg rolls were literally eggs that were rolled around in kitty litter.
Their masterpiece was what they were trying to pass off as Chicken Sesame.  I swear I found a beak in it. Not a sesame seed in sight. The sauce was amalgam kerosene and fish heads that burned my eyes. The diet Coke was OK. Avoid this place like the plague (which I think I may have contracted)."}
