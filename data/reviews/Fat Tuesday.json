{"text":"This place is soooooooooooooooo good.  The drinks are tasty, always get an extra shot... shit, your in Vegas!!  I got the Octaine 90 mixed with the hurricane."}
{"text":"I visited Tempe and of course I had to see this famous \"Mill Ave\" strip. This was one of the places we went to. Mind you, we went on a Saturday afternoon so it wasn't packed, there wasn't a DJ and no one was blacked out drunk but there is a place just like this in Downtown San Diego that I love going to and this place was exactly like it! It was 105 outside and me being used to year long 70 degree weather..I needed something frozen and I needed a buzz to cope with the damn heat. The Mango Berry slushee was the ticket! This place is great, and the patio is very spacious. Looks like it could be a good time at night. Definitely a place you want to go to when you want a quick buzz...get one drink (any of them, really) and one of those cherries soaked in Everclear and you're good for the night!"}
{"text":"This is a great place in a great location. The drinks are great during happy hour and they offer discounts to employees of some of the local businesses. The food is great but way over priced. There are some bartenders that don't know how to make drinks and there are some that make amazing drinks so there is non consistency. Some of the female waitresses come around way too often and make it a little uncomfortable. For the most part it's a great place to just chill. They play pretty good music and have plenty of space."}
{"text":"We ordered the 44 Magnum with the extra shot and 1/2 yard. Between my honey and I we were definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol by the time we made it back out to the street. Well worth the $12. Unfortunately I've got a horrid headache now at 7pm from all the cheap liquor from today."}
{"text":"Drinks are really good here. They have a good variety of slushy type drinks and great combinations. I also have the fried pickles and they were pretty good they were thick slices of pickles that I liked. We also got the buffalo wings and those were also very good. I will definitely go back and recommend to anybody wanting to chill with friends, pre party or Sunday Sunday."}
{"text":"First time here and i loved it ! Bartender was very welcoming (brandon) will definitely be coming back ! Best Daiquiris Ever !"}
{"text":"Me and my friends were on a layover in Phoenix and were told to go to Mill st. for a couple hours. We walked past this place and had to turn back because the music was too good. We went in and enjoyed the happy hour on almost all drinks. So inexpensive! And best of all the service was unparalleled. The bartender, Ryan, was so sweet in suggesting different drinks, telling us about AZ, and just giving us some awesome company. We will definitely be hitting this place up when we're back in Tempe. Check out the local beers, the dance floor, and the margarita mixes."}
{"text":"Great service from our waitress Heaven!! Drinks were fantastic!! Food was just ok....nothing special! But definitely will be back for the Daiquiris !!!"}
{"text":"FAT TUESDAY! The only proper way to get drunk in Vegas before noon. Get an extra $1 house shot or two. You're in VEGAS."}
{"text":"Great drinks I really love that the Daiquiris are pre-made literally really good! I really like the atmosphere very laid back. I came in a Saturday around 4 which is happy hour! And it wasn't at all crowded. Very nice bar tender and quick service!"}
{"text":"Not sure what Brenda B. is talking about...this place has WAYYY more than 5 types of daiquiri! Maybe she was just talking about the mixes you can order? 
I tried their mango, jungle juice, and blue razz \"slushies\" and thought they were all really good...but the mango was my favorite...I highly recommend it, if you like mangos! 
For the amount of slushi/alcohol you get, their prices are really good. I went at night and it was pretty crowded, but I was able to go up to the bar and get my drink within about 5 minutes of getting in line. I just wish I could have seen what kind of alcohol is mixed into each one. I'm sure there's probably a list somewhere, but it was too crowded for me to see anything except the names of flavors."}
{"text":"AWESOME ALCOHILIC SLUSHY BAR!
Great for night life, but not so great for daytime waitress service
you can sit on the patio with your dog though!"}
{"text":"On Mill ave, this place is my favorite. The staff is super nice and the drinks are really cheap. I like that they mix up the music with electro. Overall, this place is never as packed but that part f the reason why I enjoy the venue."}
{"text":"I love the drinks. Service is ok. Great music. Patio is the back. This is probably my favorite bar on mill. It used to be better. But hopefully management will up there game to compete with casa and el hefe"}
{"text":"Honestly my favorite place I've visited so far. The blended drinks are awesome. Call me silly, but I prefer those to the pure liquid drinks. I'm sort of slushy drink person. Music was good. A little empty but I was there a little late. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"A slight taste of New Orleans on Mill Ave. Although the drinks aren't as good or as powerful as what you find on Bourbon St, a decent substitute when you can't get to the Big Easy. There are a variety of flavors to choose from.  Service was generally quick. Has outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Love this place especially the bellini. Unfortunately they didn't have it when I went there yesterday but the creamsacle is amazing too. Good happy hour with the drink prices. Wish you could order the 100oz like you can in Vegas but gotta love the lame liquor laws in Arizona. Always a good time here"}
{"text":"I spent most of my first year being legal drinking age at this wild, college bar. It was fun then, but I got older, it wore on me. It's a big ASU bar and there's no escaping the drunk college kids. The guys can usually be found on the patio barking lame pick up lines at the female passerbys and the ladies are usually grinding it up on the small dance floor on the weekend nights.

With the summer heat, Fat Tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated. But if you don't want to drink them with the college crowd, hit the bar during the day or early evenings."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic time last night. Fat Tuesday was one of the first bars we hit in the night, so we were there before it got very busy. It was friend's 21st birthday and the staff was awesome, especially Jason. Easily the most entertaining and engaging bartender I've ever had. Great drinks, made quickly and well combined with magic tricks and science! I will be coming back because of the entire staff but especially Jason."}
{"text":"Place is awesome! Great live music going, one man band. Had spinach and artichoke dip that was good.  Margaritas were excellent, shots were great and to top it off they took $5 with Veebow app!  Good times!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here in Jan 2011 to try it out. We liked how it didn't have any cover charge and had an interesting menus (except for the alligator meat). We went in and found out you can sit yourself wherever you like. Waiters and bar tenders were nice, we ordered our food, and we had a good time with the music too.

They do have a dance floor, but never seen anyone use it maybe they do late at night. The drinks are fairly cheap and we got super drunk one night which was fun!!! Would we go back again? Yes, we would. Would love to stay late at that place sometime."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for years. Was always great time. After a couple months of not going out, I decided to come out to fat Tuesday's for my 24th bday (because it was my favorite place) Not knowing we have new \"security guards\" who think they are god. Well, tonight my brother was tackled, put in a choke hold & brang to the police for absolutely no reason! A guy came up to him, punched him & ran. For no reason at all. So my brother gets tackled, put in a headlock & goes to jail for absolutely nothing. Lol I would never come to this establishment ever again...I have spent thousands of dollars here & this is how patrons get treated....... No thanks."}
{"text":"12 bucks to get a considerable buzz AND quench your thirst in the dry, desert heat?

OKAY!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. 

Never had a heard a good thing about this place, I went here on a Wednesday night with some friends because I wanted to check it out. My college town had a great alcoholic smoothie/slushie pace and it was bomb, everyone loved it and could not get enough of it. Sadly, Fat Tuesday does not hold a candle to it.

Mainly because the bartender was so incredibly rude. I asked him about the special written on the board outside and he told me that was only for happy hour (then maybe you should write that on the board). I stalled before ordering and asked my firned what she was getting. She said something then I ordered too based off what I saw on the machines, I just wanted something fruity. We both told him our orders and he goes, \"Whatever, girls\" and laughed. Um, I'm sorry? Did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order? If you don't want people ordering girly drinks, don't make them! Needless to say we only tipped him fifty cents, still making our SMALL drinks $5.

Not going back here ever."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good reviews about this place and so I had to try it when I came to vegas. Ended up loving it! I love how they have mash ups of different flavors. I got the half yard mango colada which was pretty good. I had no problem with the service. The employee even asked if I wanted more 151 shots and made small talk. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is so inexpensive but so disgusting.. I had nachos and the portions are so small and there was barely any cheese.. My mom had a latte and it was basically a bit of coffee mixed with a shitload of milk. I've never had coffee so greasy before. It's a great place to sit and watch the fountain show though...

Maybe my review is bad bc I'm not of drinking age yet and couldn't try the daiquiri??"}
{"text":"This place was pretty nice on a Saturday if you like to dance, but don't like super large crowds. They have a full bar, but most people sip on the frozen drinks, as is immediately obvious. I had two of those, but they were pretty good, the miami vice was probably the one I'd recommend though. The outside was cool too, if you're not into loud music, you can just chill on a patio. I don't know when the dress code comes into play, because it says \"no hoods, no neck tattoos, etc.\" I have both of those, and they didn't care. All-in-all, pretty cool, but the service could have been better. I felt like the bartender that helped me was annoyed, and all I asked was \"which of these drinks are the best sellers?\""}
{"text":"This restaurants has horrible service. We waited over 20 minutes for our appetizer and it was only chips and guac. An hour and 15 minutes later we decided to leave since our food never arrived. Restaurant wasn't busy at all. I would say maybe less than 20 customers which were all there before we walked in. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and I will never waste my time going back."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday's is the place to go if you want sugary slushies that mess you up. I usually don't care for chains, but the Mill location is decent and has no cover. I've never experienced any problems with the staff like other people, but I wouldn't doubt that there are smart asses working there. Put them in place!

Drinks are average price, with the slushies being the specialty. Depending on the night they will have a DJ playing run of the mill top 40 crap, but it doesn't really interfere with your drinking. Crowd is a mix of ASU students and townies, depending on the time of year. Come with low expectations and leave happy!"}
{"text":"We went here for my girlfriend's birthday this past weekend. We were there for maybe a half an hour and the drinks were eh. Ok. Their big thing is the wall of slushy mixed drinks behind the bar. Those are eh. Ok. The ice greatly waters down the little bit of alcohol in them. What's worse is the flavor doesn't even make up for it. It's basically like drinking water alcohol with food coloring in it. Which considering the quality and amount of alcohol given, they're overpriced as well. My girlfriend was not drunk and excused herself to the restroom. She felt sick earlier after dinner and got sick in the restroom in the trash can. Some guy, who shouldn't have been in the ladies restroom in the first place, looked at me and said she has to go. \"She threw up she has to go!\" I was calmly trying to explain that we had just gotten there and that she had barely had anything to drink. He didn't care. We went back to the table to tell our friends we had to leave and he ran over and flashed his light in her face. A guy from the door came over. I tried to explain to him as well and my gf was totally fine and trying to explain to the other gentleman. The guy from the bathroom said \"I don't care if I said she's gotta go she's gotta go!\" The worst part about this is, is that neither one of us raised our voices except to be heard over music and were totally respectful the whole time. It completely jumped the night off on the wrong foot and caused my girlfriend to be upset and embarrassed on her birthday. I will never return and neither will any of our 8 friends that were witness to this that evening. We'll also be writing other reviews on other sites as well."}
{"text":"What more can I say 190 Octane with an extra shot is all I need in my life...the prices are affordable compared to other bars on the strip....$16 for 46oz mug and take a couple of bucks off when you refill...awesome!!!!! I went to the one at the Caesar palace and my only complain is the size.....it's small and there are only a couple of seats so you have to go seat hunting if you want to hang around"}
{"text":"Thank you for a great happy hour! Def recommend! The bartenders were fantastic and attentive to my drink preferences (salted rims!) Head over there your next time on Mill Ave!"}
{"text":"Their alcohol slushies are undrinkable and are sure case of gut rot. As far as the place, its pretty small you'll probably want to leave after 10 minutes."}
{"text":"The bartenders were awesome. Gave me samples of 3 different drinks before I decided on one. The shots are GENEROUS. The mugs are worth half the price alone- I still have mine and use them for long car rides. Every mix I've ordered has been awesome- great for getting your buzz on when you're on the strip."}
{"text":"I love this place! I do not go to Mill often but when I do Fat Tuesdays is my spot! The food always goes perfectly with the drinks! Simple but great! The music is always good too! Alex is the best! She rocks as a server and is super sweet and sincere! It's nice going to a place and actually having your server remember to check in on you and see if you need anything and remember you the next time you go in too! Shout out to Alex!"}
{"text":"Haha! This place is a joke. So lame it makes me laugh. Not only is the music whack, but the bouncers are clueless, pathetic white boys with no idea what a mockery they are. After getting bored and deciding to leave, we were waiting for our friends outside. The brain-dead bouncer thought he could tell us we couldn't stand on the sidewalk. Too bad it's a public space and he had to look stupid since we didn't move. Sorry suckers. Oh wait, not I'm not."}
{"text":"Great place great vibe drinks are good price also my man pulled tons of girls that night"}
{"text":"Fat Tuesdays is expensive but I still love it... Every time I come to vegas I have to stop by fat Tuesdays... There are several but my favorite one is at Cesar's palace! You get a little tipsy and the drinks are delicious the one I get taste like a big stick Popsicle pineapple and fruit punch! Yum! I love fat Tuesdays"}
{"text":"I've got a Fat Tuesday(s)? back home. This one is a hell of a lot cleaner. It's not too upbeat (depending on your definition) and may even be lackluster at times, which did water down the experience a bit,  but it does pick up. Easy recommend when \"starting\" your night."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday.... One of my fav spots for drinks. Customer service is amazing, drinks so tasty, music is so fun, they have a cool dance floor, outside patio is fun an nice. Everyone just smiles an laughs an has fun. Feels like home when I'm here. The drink options are outta this world love this place."}
{"text":"Mikhael is awesome!!!! He totally hooked us up for our friends birthday! And is a total sweetheart. Def coming back to see him on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Decent drink specials if you happen to like frozen drinks or hurricanes. I ordered the Bourbon BBQ Bacon Burger and wasnt blown away by it. First off it, didnt come with the sweet potato fires the menu said it did and my burger was over cooked for my taste. My waitress later said if I wanted it that way, I should have asked. I guess it was my fault of reading my menu correctly..."}
{"text":"We came in 10 minutes after close and the crew member still served us drinks! We didn't feel rushed ordering 4 drinks as our server patiently waited and even suggested some popular flavors. Super friendly and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"It's kinda sad we were hunting for a place like this instead of shopping or something. To be quite honest, I'm pretty much an undeclared alcoholic, but even this was a new for me. It was 3 in the afternoon and we found this place inside caesar forums. I was unsure of what to order, so of course I order the supposedly strongest thing that was on the menu (190 Octane, orange and vodka). Now I'm always down to try new things so I wanted my drink mixed up...asked the lady behind the bar what else they had. She listed drinks and drinks, but none caught my attention till 151 came up. 151 you say? 151 and fruit punch you say? Hurricane you say? Fruit punch+orange+vodka+bacardi151= true alcoholic slurpee. Of course a normal 1/2 yard isn't gonna do the drink justice, so a yard is a must. By now I could tell that the lady could tell that I could tell that she could tell...well basically she knew I wanted to drink. \"Extra shot for 2 dollars?\" she asked. I gave a skeptical look...I've already had enough alcohol in my drink to keep me content. \"Should I?\" I asked. She looked me in the eye and gave me a reassuring nod as if she understood my views on alcohol...it makes everything more fun. I paid my 19 dollars (17 for the yard + 2 for the shot) and walked over to my friends. Only one thought came to my mind...what have I done. I now know the feeling the Hulk gets, he cannot control his rage...I could not control the alcoholism. It was only 3 pm and I had enough alcohol to waste a normal person. I would of took my sweet time with it but I was thirsty. Surprisingly after I hit the bottom I wasn't even buzzed...what is wrong with me?

In all seriousness tho, this should be a must when you come to vegas. Where else can you walk the street with alcohol in hand?"}
{"text":"Good idea in theory, but not in practice. Haha.

In theory, this place is amazing. Talk about easy access to alcohol. Coming here to Fat Tuesday is like being at the slurpee machines at 7-11. All you have to do is make a choice, tell the \"bartender\" and within seconds...boom, you've got yourself a drink! For $8, you can get 20 oz. of some really potent liquor and mask the flavor of it with fruity juices and blended ice, together it is awesomeness in a cup - which to me is a deadly combination! 

In practice, just get ready to be sloshed by the time you finish it. I got a \"Category 5 Hurricane\" which is mixed with Bacardi 151. Since you can barely taste the alcohol, you may find yourself downing it quickly like me. By the time I reached the opposite end of the Forum Shops I was already wasted. Yeah, it's that strong."}
{"text":"This was the one place where my friends and I really wanted to go while in Vegas.  My friend said, \"I want a drink as tall as my femur\".  And so, the hunt for Fat Tuesday began. It actually took us quite a bit of time to find this place, and we even had to ask a worker in Caesar's Palace. But we DID eventually find it, and we were so excited!

We decided to go for the half yard, because it seemed like the most reasonable size.  There are several cool things about this place. First, you can sample the flavors! There are a large variety of drinks to choose from, so it can get a bit overwhelming. It is good to try a few to make sure you like it before you commit to a whole drink. When I sampled two,  I chose the one where I couldn't taste the alcohol, hahah. Electric Lemonade was so yummy!  The second cool thing - you can save your cup and bring it back for a discounted drink. The half yard was $14, but it would only be $11 if you bring back the cup. However it does vary per drink, but you can see the price breakdowns in the picture I posted. 

Fat Tuesday can get a bit crowded, but that just shows how yummy the drinks are.  The worker was really nice, and was really cool about getting us the samples we wanted to try. Keep this in mind - I think there are about 5 other Fat Tuesdays around the strip, so when you want to go, just go on Yelp and see which one is closest to you. If you are having trouble finding this particular one like I was, it is in the Forum at Caesar's Palace right next to the Atlantis display/performance. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Octane 190!

My 2nd drink right off the plane when I landed at 9pm.  I figured most of my friends were already there and already started with the drinking so I had to catch up fast right?  Monster yard +$1 extra shot = start to a good Vegas trip!

For $18 and something cool to drink in the hot weather that doesn't taste bad.  Can't lose."}
{"text":"Great service from our bartender Brandon. We were not only welcomed the second we walked in the door but he continued to check in on us and made great recommendations with food and drinks. I have come here for years and always enjoy it but this was by far one of my favorite trips here. Thanks to Brandon for the excellent service!"}
{"text":"OMG! I was so excited to try out this place. I got the half yard (32 oz). In the spirit of Vegas, ALL IN. I piggybacked on a friend's order that consists of three amazing flavors: Pina Colada, Octane, and Eye Candy. It was scorching hot so this was the perfect drink to walk down the main strip buzzed. Tip: Also make sure to finish the drink if you're going to ride the bus I think they don't allow you to bring it. Also for the shuttle, you must have a lid covering the cup. In the future, I'm definitely making pit stops at Fat Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Everyone rate their drinks, but I'm rating their potato chips! My favorite flavors are ketchup, white cheddar cheese, and honey bbq chipotle. They make it fresh, bag then seal up the bag so you can take it togo. My vegas trip will not be complete without their chips."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night. Even though I was kicked out because this crazy drunk chick decided to try and fight BOTH my boyfriend and I...it was really fun. The security was on point they didn't let this crazy chick go far with her antics before ushering us out. The dance floor was fun and the DJ was great especially compared to the others on Mill I  heard that night.."}
{"text":"Headed back to Fat Tuesdays last week. We had a fun time, everything was great. The appetizers and the drinks. We had a lot of fun people watching outside. The music wasn't as loud either. Service was excellent.  We will definitely be back. A big thank you to the manager, Chad, for inviting us back and giving us a nice gift coupon."}
{"text":"Overpriced (of course) and a small \"stadium cup\" drink doesn't come with a lid (soda does come with a kid though).  $9 20 oz frozen daquiri, $3 for bottled water, $3 large soda, and $5 nachos (your typical cheap round yellow corn tortilla chips and canned liquid cheese).  

The cashier wasn't friendly but was thorough at his job (tipping out excess ice from the soda cup when requested.  No line at noon time on a holiday Monday.

We did then proceed to use their seating area for the Atlantis fountain/statue show, so that gives them some bonus star points.

In one word: Convenient."}
{"text":"First time I went to Vegas I told myself I'm going to get myself a Fat Tuesday and I did. It seems it's a must thing to do right? Just walking around sipping on your cold slushy fruit alcohol long yard. Oh and you get a little bit of a discount if you bring back the souviner cups to be reused! So they have a lot of different fruit flavor slushies to try. They'll give you a sample and you can mix! I mix the green (forgot the flavor) and strawberry! I would also add an extra shot because hey you're in Vegas! Warning once you get to the bottom it's so nasty but maybe you won't notice anymore. Have fun and stay safe!"}
{"text":"Seriously, one of the best deals in Vegas to get your booze on!

$12 for a half yard - which is more than enough to get you buzzing; or $6 extra for the full yard. Definitely go for the extra shot! Unfortunately, my shot sank to the end of the cup so my last 4 sips were heavily liquored up! 

Service is fast, there are interesting flavors, and it's cheap! Great way to stumble around during your time in Vegas ;) 

P.S. Bellini + Mango is DELICIOUS. All my friends loved my combo :D"}
{"text":"The Superman slushie tastes like nostalgia! Mmmmm, adolescent movie slushie meets college!

Every time I come here with my husband it's awesome! We end up having a great time getting a little sloshed and stumbling back to the light rail. *smirks* It's really the best when it's their happy hour pricing. $5 for a huge alcoholic slushy that comes in a bunch of favors. Yup. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I havent been in this place since they remodeled it, but its much better now! If your going for a bike ride down mill this is definitely a good place to stop. At night it gets a little more busy but everything runs smooth.. and the slushy drinks are awesome.. but words of wisdom, if you eat the everclear cherrys, EAT THEM FAST..its a shot you have to chew..bleck"}
{"text":"Powerful drinks, powerful drinks.  Had New Orleans written all over it.  These are gateway beverages to open up the personality.  Great place to pitstop, mingle, and keep it moving to get on with your evening.  Get the Cat 5!!!"}
{"text":"worth the price, especially if you come back with your cup for refills.  They also give you coupons for $1 off your next purchase.

Lots of flavors to choose from and the staff isn't rude.  I recommend adding a shot (or two) to give your drink an extra lil boost :)"}
{"text":"This happened to be the closest Fat Tuesday during my stay at the Venetian, but I immediately had to get over there and get hammered. This Fat Tuesday is kinda hidden in the Forum Shops as it is in the one hallway that dead-ends in the Shops that no one goes down... unless you come to Vegas and eat Cheesecake Factory (most notable thing next to it).

190 octane and two extra shots of everclear. I guarantee you won't be seeing straight in a couple of hours."}
{"text":"They wouldn't let my friend in because she didn't have a horizontal 21 and over license, even though she's from California. So stupid, she's been 21 for three months already. The bouncer tried telling her she HAD to get a horizontal id."}
{"text":"I don't normally drink frozen drinks, but when I do I order them from Justin. He was the nicest guy in the place and you should just take his word for what to get. I had the Pina & Strawberry with shot of strawberry rum. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile, but it's still awesome, can't go wrong with alcoholic slurpees...isn't that what everyone made in college, anyway??? Yummy yummy drinks at GREAT prices. Easy to choose from since they all taste great. Bartender was nice. Will definitely come here again, next time will mix the flavors--I got sick of just mango after a couple sips."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday's is one of my least favorite places on Mill Ave. When it's not the college crowd (and even when it is) Fat Tuesday's is filled with some sketchy folks. I've never had the food but the drinks are so-so.
The slushy gimmick isn't worth going to this bar more than once"}
{"text":"Great music great people. Prices  are always cool on drinks and the music is cool.definitely a cool place to hang out"}
{"text":"Here from California!!! Great service!! Heaven assisted us through  the whole night! Great wings and good happy hour!!"}
{"text":"I prefer the PH location over this one. I don't like the bar style - most aggressive gets served first. BUT I do like the $1 off (applicable to the Imperial Palace location as well). 

In order of favorites (the following are all unmixed):
- Bellini (PEACH PEACH PEACH)
- Mango
- Strawberry 

As for the chippery, it's alright! I ordered the salt & malt. Not too sour. I think it would be more amazing if the chips were a little thicker and warm (suggestion: leave it out under a heat lamp instead?)."}
{"text":"My all time favorite alcoholic beverage of choice (so far in life) is a strawberry daiquiri. Mostly because of the fact that it's a slushy, so when I heard there's these places in Vegas that specialize in slushies I WAS SUPER EXCITED!!  I knew about the giant yardsticks but usually when I see them they only come in strawberry daiquiri, strawberry margarita, or pina colada... why didn't anybody tell me about THIS place sooner??

There's a giant list of flavors and a variety of sizes to choose from, and usually the guy/gal working is kind enough to let you sample as many flavors as you'd like! I ended up going with a frozen RedBull Vodka, I can't remember what they called it though! It was super yummy bc I already love the taste of RedBull and vodka in non slushy form! The other flavors I tried were all yummy, I wasn't as amazed by the Peach Bellini as everyone else though, guess I'm just not a fan of champagne! :(

Your drink comes out SUPER FAST bc they're kind of premade in machines (doesn't make it any less good though!) and as everyone else mentioned, you can add an extra shot to it for only a dollar! They come in these funky test tubes, be sure to MIX THIS IN!! And if you're all about saving money, keep your cup for discounted refills and hopefully they'll give out coupons for a dollar off your next purchase too! 

Even though buying alcohol at the store is probably more cost effecient, here you'd get a super yummy smoothie for the same price as a much smaller and possibly worse tasting drink at a club or bar! :)"}
{"text":"Drinks are so frozen so it takes forever to drink. But they are tasteful. The bartender was really nice. I had the Miami vice. I recommend this place if you are ready to chill for a while at a spot. Also they have cherries soaked in everclear which is fun."}
{"text":"Get your drink on in the heat with one of their slushy booze filled drinks. You get a fair bit for your money, and the drinks are tasty and plentiful. Grab a refillable cup to save on subsequent trips."}
{"text":"I actually kind of like this place, believe it or not.  As a matter of fact one of my photos on my profile is from a night at Fat Tuesday.  I haven't been in a while, but we tend to go when it's not as busy (during Spring Break, December and the summer).  Notice the strategic anti-ASU pattern there?  No offense, but Fat Tuesday can be a fun place with the right people.
 
When we go we get our run of the show (there's usually under 20 people there) on off-nights.  The main draws being cheap $1 frozen daquiri drinks on Wednesdays (oh, 190 Octane how I LOVE your orange goodness!), free rein with the music video requests, and a huge dance floor to ourselves.  It got so fun and crazy one off-night that some chick dared Melinda to a Michael Jackson \"Thriller\" dance-off.  And, well, Mel just kicked her butt.

Word to the wise...cheap, sticky drinks tend to equal gross sticky floors."}
{"text":"I take every out of town visitor here for daqs and people watching on Mill.  Occasionally I'll come here to drink and read on the patio.  Five stars for what it is . . . a place to get quick daqs with lots of variations.  The appetizers aren't half bad for bar food, especially the cajun rolls"}

{"text":"I like this Fat Tuesday location more than the one at Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile because this one is more than just a counter/stand. Bonus points also, because it's right next to Express and the random fish tank show thing at Caesar's?

Peach Bellini is hands down my fav. lovelovelove. I am not a big fan of tasting the alcohol, and this definitely does the trick. When you're done with your half yard, keep the bottle (for refills of course), because it makes a really amusing sound when you whack it against things. Try it.

tl;dr: Peach Bellini Peach Bellini"}
{"text":"Sometimes I really wonder what my fellow Yelpers are really reviewing. What do they want Fat Tuesday's to be - a gormet bar that sprinkes magic dust into your drink that helps you get laid? C'mon peeps, judge it for what it is.

As others have said, this place's main thing is their wall of frozen booze. I feel like I'm in a Quick-Trip ordering a drink. Well, until I eat that damn Atomic Cherry that has been soaking in Everclear and I sip my drink that is heavily diluted with some alcohol. then I quickly realize that if I am going to drink two or more of these things... I might want to call a cab or I'll be getting pulled over by a horse cop as I exit Mill Ave.

Is it a dance club? Sure, it has a dance floor. But I like to think of it more as a place to watch people who have had 2 too many slushies try to shake it (all in good fun of course, because I've done it). This isn't no Rain night club of Vegas, people. 

What's good? No cover. People come and go so there is always someone new to talk to or watch. Outside area is a blast to sit and drink and people watch the people of Mill. Bartenders are lightning quick and make my drinks very well.

I love this place. What is there not to love unless you are looking for Scottsdale glamour."}
{"text":"Octane's for my husband with 3 extra shots, and I vary between the strawberry, mango or a combo. We have a collection of their mugs because it seems every trip to Vegas we make we always forget our mugs (cheap refills when you have a mug already)... but the reason we hit his specific one up, rather than the other locations is the staff. They all have great people working there, but these guys go a little above :) (and one of the guys is from CO too) 

You can't go wrong with a giant slushy that gets you a good buzz after one drink... and besides when it is 115 out a cool mug (that stays cold cuz of the insulation around the mug) goes down very nicely"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for lunch. There weren't a lot of people there but that still didn't help with the service. 

It took a substantial amount of time for us to get our food which was ok. He had the jalapeno burger and I had a shrimp po' boy and they both came on ciabatta bread, which made it a little difficult to enjoy the shrimp which wasn't as crispy as I liked. 

The music was nice and mellow while we were eating lunch. It took forever for our waitress to bring the check so I had to get it from the bartender and then after waiting for 10 minutes she finally came back with the receipts. 

Overall, it was an ok place. Nothing much to brag about but then again they're known for their drinks and not their food for a reason."}
{"text":"So awesome to have Fat Tuesday in Westgate! We had  an awesome time with killer service. Johnnie was our bartender and she is both beautiful and super attentive! The rest of the staff were great. This is an absolute must stop at for anyone visiting Westgate!"}
{"text":"During my last visit to Vegas I was introduced to Fat Tuesday and became a fan! I don't enjoy the flavor of alcohol so this spiked slushy was the perfect drink for me. I was back the next day and this time added an extra shot for $1. I also tried a jello shot and wow was that strong!"}
{"text":"Years ago when I was a vegas amateur at the ripe age of 22-23, I felt the need to slurp down one of these deliciously sweet icy drinks in minutes. It was so hot outside and this was so refreshing. Little did I know that when I stood up I had to immediately sit back down. Moral of the story is, pace yourself young ones.  Fat Tuesdays is a marathon not a sprint."}
{"text":"It's Vegas baby! All recipes are 10. They have tasty slushes compared to others. Great Flossie's better then their competitors.  However fat burger and its sugar had great slushes as well. Live life and drink. 

Stay hungry my friends."}
{"text":"Guy with the man bun is super nice and awesome. Pro tip- u can use the 50% off your first drink on many occasions!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here regularly since moving to Vegas 3 years ago. Great for a decent priced cocktail, or a daiquiri to cool off during the HOT summer days. Grab a hotdog, pizza, homemade chips or nachos to soak up the booze. Staff is also a reason I keep coming Back, Elizabeth and Matt always make sure I leave here satisfied."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! I came here twice in fact! I've been here every time, the past 3 times I've been to Vegas! It's definitely your best bang for the buck! It's $13 for a 1/2, and add a $2 shot and you're set with a VERY happy buzz!!!! =)"}
{"text":"Seriously, it's not Vegas unless you have a drink in your hand as you walk the strip. I would normally give something like this three stars because it's average. You can buy a massive thing of booze and walk around with it. Cool. 

It gets the fourth star because dude gave my friend and I a hookup as we were there for her bachelorette party. An extra shot, a cheaper price, and a discount for a refill. Customer service for the win. And I'm all about that customer service. It's the best way to get me to come back to an average place when I can get the same stuff somewhere else. Aka - keep it up."}
{"text":"Who wouldn't want to guzzle down on the frozen tasty beverages. Everything was delicious we sampled a good amount before deciding. 

It was a great way to start our evening on the strip. We finished both of ours. I recommend this place to anyone. We'll be sure to stop by again on our next visit."}
{"text":"It's not Vegas until you've walked around with at least a half-yard of a boozy drink.

I find Fat Tuesday's drinks a little bit stronger than other joints.  I think others know that, too.  I've noticed that half of the customers and half of the staff always looks hungover.  

Flavors aren't too bad.  They're pretty accurate.  Strawberry is great, but not sure if I'll do the Red Bull one again; way too weird of a bitter taste once it started getting warm.  Then again, who likes warm Red Bull?  

Love their stuff, and will probably continue to frequent at Fat Tuesdays as long as my liver can handle it.  Double-fist this shiz, yo!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wen here in Jan 2011 to try it out. We liked how it didn't have a no cover and had an interesting menus (except alligator). We go in and found out you can sit yourself wherever you like. Waiters and bar tenders were nice, we ordered our food, and we had a good time with the music too.

They do have a dance floor, but never seen anyone use it maybe they do late at night. The drinks are fairly cheap and we got super drunk one night which was fun!!! would we go back again? yes, we would. Would love to stay late that place."}
{"text":"I LOVE FAT TUESDAYS!!! :D 

So going to Vegas, is all about gambling, getting drunk, and seeing some strippers right? Being the fact that my last trip to Vegas was with my mom and her friend, strippers were OUT of the question. That would be extremely weird, seeing some strippers with your mom. We did our fair share of gambling, being that I'm a student and super broke. But the thing that made my Vegas Trip worth it was my YARD long Strawberry Daiquiri, $17 isn't bad for that big ass drink. After I chugged that thing down, it didn't matter that I was spending my Vegas Vacation with my mom. The casinos were spinning and I was having a ball. :D 

I can't wait to go back and try more flavors!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for frozen drinks!   Banana banshee is my favorite! The food is really good too! And the servers are friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"if you want to cool off on a HOT day Fat Tuesdays is the place I prefer happy hour because getting a deal always makes me a happy camper! 
THIS PLACE IS DEAD A LOT - SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO RAGE THIS IS NOT THE PLACE but it is perfect place to cool down and chat with a few friends... 

- If your having southern withdrawls and looking to feel at home the decor makes you feel like your down town burban street."}
{"text":"I want to start this out by saying, I love Fat Tuesday,.......in Louisiana ...most menu items are fairly good. and you have 10 to 15 types of daiquiris to choose from.
 I order their mix on line and have daiquiri parties at home.I have more flavors of their drink mix than this bar does.
 The Fat Tuesday in Minnesota( now closed due to state licensing issues) had the best jambalaya around, I was told it was brought in from Louisiana.
 The managers here decided the menu wasn't working and went to burgers and bar snacks,....what I ordered was nasty, It was a combo appetizer, I only  ate it because I ordered a drink. The pizza I saw  looked un -edible,unless your drunk.
The service was horrible ! I waited for ever to get a drink and to order food,Trust me it wasn't busy either.
 Speaking of which, there were only 5 flavors of daiquiris,the rest of the bar is a vodka bar ! One whole side is mixed drinks,nothing to choose from daiquiri -wise.
This is not up to Fat Tuesdays standards for anything.
 In my opinion, unless they get off Mill Ave, I think this place will be gone soon.Or they should change the name, they  have NO business calling it self a Fat Tuesday.
If I hadn't been in a dozen other ones , I would never go to a Fat Tuesdays again."}
{"text":"I ordered the pimp juice, which consist of hurricane and mango and it was so sooooo good. I would highly recommend this place. Drinks are reasonably priced and can be enjoyed at various locations and the staff are friendly. Kudos to them, they just want to see you drunk!

Tip: I would drink this before going to a pool party if at all possible, because drinks are ridiculously priced in Vegas. A lot here will go a long way!"}
{"text":"If you want freeze your brain on a really good adult smoothie this is a great place to start. There is so much varieties and the sizes to pick from. Seating outside has improved for people watching on Mill Ave. food is really good if you get the bar food munchies"}
{"text":"They do have happy Hour seven days of the week and that allowed me to grab a Sunday daiquiari for just $5.50. If you check-in on Yelp, it will save another half of that, but I had already paid before realizing that gem. Otherwise, just the typical college crowd and the smokers love the back patio. If you can get a day where the front patio is smoke free, it is a good spot to watch the folks cruise past on Mill. The only thing with that is a bad fly problem in the front..oh you will see. Bring your swatter."}
{"text":"Wooot for \"grown up slushies!\"

This place is a staple of my Vegas adventures and was just as fun in AZ. 
We hit Happy Hour for cheap drinks & apps after an expensive Octoberfest. Lord please forgive me for the extra shots of everclear on top...$1 floaters...they should be ashamed of themselves...sinful...I LOVEDDD it!"}
{"text":"I'm in town from Chicago with 5 friends for the week. Last night, we went to Fat Tuesday. I was the last in line to show my ID to the bouncer. When I got up to him, he tells me I had to take off my cross in order to get in. Keep in mind, all find of my friends in front of me were wearing necklaces too, but I was the only one he said something to. So I take off my cross, get inside and put it right back on. 2 minutes later, the bouncer walked up to me, tapped me on the shoulder and walked me out of the bar. Obviously my 5 friends walked out with me. Never have I been to a place that asks their customer to remove their cross and jewelry to enter. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is located right on Mill, with a patio that is right in the action.

they gimmick of this primarily college bar is their frozen drinks, which are tossed around in Kwik-E-Mart squishy style windows behind the bar that you can see. they come in plenty of flavors like red, green, orange, etc. seriously, they all taste the same to me, and after a couple they only become recognizable by color.

the frozen drinks are loaded with sugar and everclear (like the HIgh Octane) so it only takes two to feel super drunk and have a real bad stomach ache (which feels even worse the next day).

they also have regular beers and liquor, and even a menu - which i never realized til someone sitting next to me was presented  a hamburger at their table. 

overall it's not my style, gimmicky, co-edy and obnoxious, and i only end up here when someone else wants to go here for some reason that i can never fathom."}
{"text":"This place was alright. Came on a Friday night and there wasn't a cover charge. We went in and right away are the alcoholic slushies just like they have all over Vegas - not as many flavors here of course though. My friends got the 190 Octane and Blue Razz which tasted great. 

The dance floor wasn't crowded, most people just hung around and danced where they stood with friends. It's a really chill and laid back atmosphere. The DJ unfortunately wasn't particularly good, the songs selected were too slow. The bathrooms were nice and clean and there wasn't a line at all. There's a patio too in the back if you need a breather or smoke. 

Overall this place doesn't really stand out from the rest, but it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Got a half price drink for checking in to Yelp at Fat Tuesday. The service was good and food was good. Was there long, but had no compliments."}
{"text":"Prices weren't bad for the big Vegas drinks. I should of added extra shots to my drink.. but it was in the middle of the day and didn't feel like getting too buzzed before having to go back to the hotel and get ready to go out. At least I got to bring my souvenir cup home :}"}
{"text":"This is my second time being here and I continue to get awesome customer service! Watch out for the bartender Chad he recommended my my drinks which taste amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my first stop for alcohol in Vegas. The drinks are strong and very tasty (you can hardly even taste the alcohol), and for light-weights like me, you become pretty tipsy after only a few drinks. The 44 Magnum is my favorite (it's the sweetest and strongest in my opinion), but you're allowed up to two samples so you can taste before you buy! 

Even though the drinks are a bit on the pricier side, the experience itself (and the fun cups) are totally worth it. Just be sure to keep your cup so that you can receive your next re-fill with a $4 discount. The half-yard and yard sizes are definitely a fun deal."}
{"text":"I've discovered the secret to coping with overwhelmingly crowded shopping malls. After the initial brain freeze, this yummy adult slurpee improved my mood CONSIDERABLY. Also have to give a shout-out to the guy who was really patient and friendly while we made up our minds."}
{"text":"You can ask to try samples! Watch out for the nuclear cherries, they're soaked in everclear!"}
{"text":"Well, there's about a million fat tuesdays all over Vegas and really not one disappoints. This location was just the first one I went to.

I got the pimp juice with an extra shot of mango rum because that's all you really need! You can ask for a sample of something if you're unsure, as well the bartenders are really helpful on helping you make a tasty combo. Worth the money and the souvenir cups are always fun to choose from."}
{"text":"Happiness in the form of a refillable mug. My only slight gripe was waiting for someone to come to the counter."}
{"text":"Wednesday June 22nd, 10 pm short Hispanic girl, with a pink shirt. Me and my cousin were deciding on what to order and then she calls us white girls in Spanish and something else and laughs about it. We ask her to repeat herself and she wouldn't! Rude and then I went back in to ask for her name and she wouldn't give it!"}
{"text":"Come here if you're thirsty. They have alcoholic slushies which are pretty darn tasty. I got a yard of their mangoberry margarita and it was nice and sweet. Don't leave without trying one!"}
{"text":"I might be a little partial to Fat Tuesday just because it was the perfect environment for the company I was with that night. It was a Saturday night, I moved quickly through the short line, found seating even though it was 10PM and it was an awesome vibe that evening! The frozen drinks are bomb if you get the extra shot, however a little on the pricey side and might take you 10 minutes to get it. The next time I visited was during a weekday at about 3pm. Headed straight out side and found it to be pretty nice actually...relaxed, cool place to chill in the daytime!! Overall i love the place and I will definitely be going back! Oh yea, bouncers were cool too and I was surprised for a place like that."}
{"text":"i almost had my brain declared dead after ordering a yard long frozen peach bellini with an extra tube shot of 151.

i'm usually not a fan of frozen drinks because my bladder gets full, my liver not feeling the booze, and my brain is frozen.  but fat tuesday's peach bellini was surprisingly pretty good to sip on while browsing through the forum shop.

you can try out different flavors before you make your decision.

good luck brain freezin' :)"}
{"text":"Make sure you grab a refillable cup! Though your initial price will of course be higher, it's definitely worth it if you're on the strip on a few days and you'll have a souvenir to take home.

The drinks are pre-mixed in a machine however you have the option to add an extra shot if you're bold enough. 190 Octane was my go to while on the strip as it contains the most alcohol per volume, mixed with a little piña colada and you've got yourself a Miami vice! The more friends the merrier!"}
{"text":"First time coming here. Was expecting cajun food on the menu. Not much to be found. Ordered gator nugs( theyre ok nothing special). Catfish nugs (were really yummy) and ceviche which i liked but mom didnt care. for. Music was EXTREMELY loud. Could barely hear each other or our waitress. Carly was great tho. Idk if ill be back. Fat tuesday add more things to the menu like gumbo, jambalaya etc."}
{"text":"I didn't even get to catch my guy's name! I came in here for the first time ever and I told that to \"guy\" and he was super friendly. He gave me some samples of what he thought I would like and let me take my time. Eventually I went with the first sample he gave me, peach Bellini and electric lemonade (super delish btw). I loved his attitude and he definitely made my first fat Tuesday experience a great one. Thank you \"guy with the glasses\"!"}
{"text":"Nice nightlife on a Friday night. A fun and friendly place to cool down in hot Tempe, Arizona.  The frozen Daiquiris are the best.  They come in various flavors.  My favorites are White Russian and Mangoberry. I also recommend the 190 Octane, and make sure to try the cherries soaked in Everclear; a mouthful of alcoholic greatness. Be careful,  because if you are a light drinker,  the cherries, will hit ya.  

The DJ rocks the beats while you dance into the night.  The mixologists are nice and courteous happy to serve you up alcoholic deliciousness. Nice atmosphere, a mixed group of people looking to have a drama free good time.  I had a great time with a group of friends,  I would definitely say,  this is THE PLACE to visit when you want to have fun on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"This is a college bar with an everyone's welcome feel. Complete bar atmosphere with high top tables and a long bar with a good amount of seating. There is a large patio out back and another smaller booth seating area in the front. Heaters everywhere make for plenty of available comfortable seating. The drinks are reasonably priced for Mill Ave but you're still paying \"club prices.\" Best deal is the groupie. $19.50 for what seems to be a solid 7-10 oz pour of alcohol. (Must have 2 people minimum to order) the Nachos are amazing. Give them a shot. The music selection is pretty good as well. Good mixture of old school and new school hip hop. On busy nights they have a dress code. The usuals, no gang stuff, no ripped jeans, etc. I did notice a no face or neck tattoos sign though. A little unusual considering that seems to be a new trend but either way, beware of it. I honestly don't have any major complaints, it's a great bar and I will be back."}
{"text":"I definitely like this place a lot. Especially during the hot summer, where you can grab a quick yard on the way to the pool! We got one of the really big ones and mixed the strawberry and mango and shared between 4 girls and added an extra shot of rum. Let me tell you, it was pretty strong and on the sugary sweet side, but still delicious!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and great music. These guys are definitely worth coming too. No charge and always have a dj"}
{"text":"Finally tried Fat Tuesday after so many years of going to Vegas and being 21 for over almost 3 years. :p  Service here is a hit or miss.  We came here for the first time and the \"bartender\" (lol, bartenders may get insulted if even called them that), and he was rude and limited my brother to 2 samples.  As newbies, we expected him to at least give us an idea of what was popular, what was strong, what was a good mix, etc.  We eventually settled for a weird mix of mud slide + octane.  I would not have tipped $1 a drink or even close to 10% had I know how horrible of a service I was given.  The second time we came by, we were properly served.  In all, service is a hit or miss, but nothing beats a $10 or so alcoholic slurpee on a hot day :p"}
{"text":"Michelle was our server and she was great! She suggested 2 wonderful daiquiris, and was on top of everything!!! Great food, super sweet happy hour, and the staff was wonderful :)"}
{"text":"security is on a power trip, wasn't even that busy and he was acting like it was a privilege to be let in."}
{"text":"We ended up at Fat Tuesday because back in the day--which now I realize must have been wayyyy back in the day--Fat Tuesday was a fun place to be.  We went for lunch thinking it was a common spot for people to enjoy the day in the sun on Mill Street. Meh. It felt like we were the only ones to have ordered food there is some time, as the server looked really surprised we wanted to eat.  Everyone else was enjoying massive cocktails on the patio while smoking more cigarettes than anyone should in hot weather. THe atmosphere didn't really work with our food, which was greasy and boring anyway.

I guess we should have known the place has really changed over the years because it was definitely not a spot I want to return to."}
{"text":"How the hell does this get 4 to 5...
you vegas mofo.'s crazy???
Strawberry n blueberry...it ok...about it.
1st we went to MGM and when finding were like
What the F!!  It had four chairs and was like I was
Back in santa anita mall after school hours.
We ended up getting from the Paris mall.
What you will do at midnight in need of a drink."}
{"text":"Love, love this place. Had their White Russian Daiquiri mixed with their tasty Banana Daiquiri. This particular location has more choices, I love more choices when it comes to alcohol. Place is pretty large, alot of Fat Tuesdays tend to be much smaller. Can't wait to have another one of their frozen delights in my hands."}
{"text":"booyah. yard long margarita or 190 octane vodka and OJ - 

5 stars for the ice cold liquor and the super hot sluts in bikinis that want to get drunk...

3 stars for the effin douche bags with their $1 flip flops, sun burns, fake-ass bling, popped collars, frayed cargo shorts, and \"woo hoo bro\" attitude...

4 stars all together..."}
{"text":"Slushy booze. Need I say anything else?

Hint--bring your expensive mug from your last visit for a cheaper 'refill.'"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with fat tuesdays! I only wish they had one of these in philly. The prices are great for a boozy slushi (with everclear) and you get to keep the cup! I enjoyed the Bellini mixed with the 190 octane and it was so good I got like 5 refills in the 2 days I was in Vegas. It's perfect to just carry around the cup because you can drink anywhere in Vegas and there are a bunch of fat Tuesdays around. Pay the extra $2 for an additional shot of everclear in your slushi and you'll be a very happy camper."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location! They are very nice and friendly unlike the other locations. Got a huge, green souvenir mug for almost $20 is a pretty good deal! My favorite was the pina colada slushie!"}
{"text":"Best Fat Tuesday on the strip & the closest one to the Wynn, TI, Palazzo, Venetian & Encore hotels.

It is located next to the aquarium & Cheesecake factory in the Forum shops. Get a half yard, share with a friend and walk around happy for the next few hours & catch the Fall of Atlantis show or watch the fishies & smiling stingrays swim by!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets when it comes to Fat Tuesday. They have a lot more business here so things definitely get busy, but there's nothing quite like getting your alcoholic slushy on while shopping tipsy in the Forum. 

Not much to say about the flavors but the staff are friendly and allow a lot of mixing. You'll be feeling it in no time!"}
{"text":"In the beginning this bar use to be a little rough and I never went to a couple years ago now its my favorite bar on Mill Ave! First of all the frozen alcohol drinks are the best at 8 dollars and change and get your buzz going which is more bang for your buck, the dance floor is pretty nice and big, bar tenders are friendly, and most of all their not racist and let everybody in. I now see more college students going here and I love the atmosphere because the staff is so nice and polite! I love the DJ who spends a mix of techno, hip hop, and pop that gets everybody in here feeling to get turned up! I recommend this bar to anybody and especially ASU students because the only color they know is green and they don't judge. I bring friends here and they always come back! keep up the good work guys and I will always be here every chance I get...."}
{"text":"It's currently 12:36am and this establishment is closed. Their hours of operation claim they are open until 2am. This is widely inaccurate. I am very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is a MUST when you are in vegas! THey have a huge variety of sizes to choose from and about 8 differnet flavors too! I got the strawberry daiquiri with an extra shot. I love how they give you extra shots in those little tubes. i think an extra shot only costs like a dollar or so which is totally worth it!! The strawberry daiquiri here tastes reallly good! u can actually tastes the strawberries instead of that syrupy taste some places have. There were even strawberry seeds which definately means they really blend strawberries in there. thats always a plus with me! (: 

One thing that was NOT so tasty were their jello shots. i didn't finish mine and ended up throwing more than half of it away. I can make waaay better ones at home!! but definately come here for their drinks. They are decent priced for Vegas. One of the bigger ones will definately give you a goooooood buzz while your walking around or gambling (:

i'll probably visit this place EVERYTIME i come to vegas now...LOVE iT!!"}
{"text":"The Tempe Fat Tueday wouldn't let me in because I wore basketball shorts..............yet Yelp and their website mentions casual attire. I love this business but its not a short drive for me. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome people, amazing staff!!! Deff coming here more often.  Going to be s lit spot for that summer heat."}
{"text":"I don't consider it a successful Vegas trip unless I've visited this place at least once. They're often copied in this town, but this place makes the best frozen drinks. Especially with the Vegas weather, there is nothing better than relaxing by the pool or just walking the strip with these frosty drinks in your hand.

The nice thing about this place is that they're all over the strip, so no matter where you go, you can find one. This is especially nice because once you have the cup, refills are significantly cheaper, so it's worth holding onto the cup. You can fill up at MGM, and by the time you get to the forum shops, you'll be ready for another one!

The flavor and drink selection is great. I'm partial to the octane 190, but only because I like strong drinks, and not overly sweet, either. They have something for everyone, though. The selection of cups/mugs is good, too. There's a size for everyone. 

The customer device is just OK. I find the staff to be pleasant, but not overly engaging or friendly. On the other hand, they're dealing with Vegas tourists all day, so I kindof get it...

The prices are a bit steep here. It's worth it to me, because it's a frozen drink and it lasts awhile. There's also a good amount of alcohol in these drinks: you will feel it! To me, you're going to pay in Vegas, so while it's expensive here, it is worth it for this town. 

If you're looking for a good frozen drink/daquiri, look no further. This is chain you want to stick with. Enjoy your drink, and cheers!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks great music love this place cuz of the dj ! Highly recommend. Coming here on weekends"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Las Vegas I must have a Fat Tuesday for the life of me... they are good, made strong and come in several flavors. A must try in my suggestion. 

The only downside to this specific fat Tuesdays is that it's in the Caesars Palace Forum Shops and there's no real short way to get to the Fat Tuesday which is at the very end of the shops unfortunately you have to walk all the way. Add a shot and your set! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Got what we needed, love the fact that they now put lids on top of the jars. Fat Tuesdays are a win every visit to Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Oh Dear Lord, this place scares me. I think Fat's is the perfect place for a bar crawl for a 21st, tourists who don't know any better, bachelorette party nightmare, or a themed night out where everyone pretends its 1990s and that daiquiris are still a cool drink. The few times I have been unwittingly dragged here, the service was always good, the drinks were strong and the food was blah. I just can't get over the slushie machines at the bar (there's something so wrong about that, when were they last cleaned!) and the boob beads everywhere. Maybe on Bourbon Street, but not here, I think I'll be going else where."}
{"text":"Getting a drink from Fat Tuesday is the alcohol equivalent of ordering a frappucino at Starbucks. They're chilled, sugary, fun concoctions in an extra tall cup! Oh, and bonus: it has booze in it! 

The real question isn't 'Is it good?' the real question is: If you didn't go to Fat Tuesday while in Vegas, did you even go to Las Vegas?"}
{"text":"Love this bar!! The bartender was a little unfriendly but she let us sample some of the flavors. I love going to one of these anytime they are where I'm traveling. You can mix as many flavors as you want. They are much more delicious and price friendly than other frozen drink places on the strip. We walked out of our way for this one. They had mudslide flavor which is what my mom was looking for. We all loved them since we were back a couple hours later for more"}
{"text":"Tried to different Fat Tuesdays, this one is by far the best! My drinks were fantastic. Very strong and well worth the money! I was able to get a pink cup, I was ecstatic about that as the location before didn't have them they also had different flavors. I only have a few complaints the first night we walked all the way from palms place hotel to use this location we made it in time and the place was closing as we showed up (early). Close on time people. You lost two customers! We went back the 2nd night because this one had such good ratings, and it was extremely busy. They didn't have the drink I had gotten before, can't remember what one but it was blue, so I ended up getting the hurricane here. I wanted a sample because, well, who wants to pay 32+ bucks for a drink they may not like, so we went in to ask and he said it would be a dollar for a tiny sample. I'm assuming because there were a bunch of people in there just getting sample after sample and I think we're trying to get drunk for free, so the bartender was getting pissed. My fiancé went with gut and went ahead and bought me one. Turns out it was awesome, deff could taste the rum. The only thing that sucks is this place is clear in the back of caesars palace, do its a walk but it was worth it and better then the other one we had gone too. If we are ever in Vegas again we will come back."}
{"text":"Every time I land in Vegas, I make a beeline for the nearest Fat Tuesday. Although I am getting older now, so I have to make sure and pop an acid reflux pill first. 

Not all the locations have it, but the Electric Lemonade is my absolute favorite. Get an extra shot of rum in the half yard and you will be good to go all day! The slushee is nice on a hot day, and the prices are reasonable for the amount of alcohol that you are drinking. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday for lunch. No wait for a table, and the waitress was very good. 
Spinach artichoke dip was done well, along with the hamburgers that we ordered. The music was a little loud for my liking, but the overall experience was good."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks from Mill and this is definitely my favorite spot!  Great atmosphere and drink selection.  Nice patio and all the bartenders are friendly and on top of it.  Ryan is one of the bartenders there and honestly he is one of the best bartenders I've seen!"}
{"text":"I love Fat Tuesday! I try to go here as much as possible, every time I've gone I have never been disappointed.  The drinks are tasty, the bartenders are fun, and you gotta make it to karaoke one of these nights. Hillarious! :p The place is kept real clean. These negative reviews are total crap. 
Actually going tomorrow night with a  group of friends for my birthday! Every time I have friends visit from out of town we always start here. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A bit of a trek to get to from the strip, but well worth it. Especially when getting refills! So save your cup(s)!"}
{"text":"I got the 190 Octane because I wanted more bang for my buck and opted for the strongest drink.  I then decided to follow everyone else's Yelp advice and add an extra shot.  I think since I only got the 20oz cup, adding the extra shot was a slight mistake.  It made the drink super strong for my taste.  I could barely even drink half of the thing and I already felt tipsy and tingly all over.  This location is pretty cool since you can grab a chair and watch the Atlantis show that starts every hour on the hour while at Caesar's."}
{"text":"I loved Fat Tuesday! I got the $12 cup that has $8 refills.
Now, I hate sugary slurpy/icy/slushie drinks. But this one that I got was just perfect! It was not super sugary (I mean I'm sure it was- but it didn't TASTE like it)! I got the Cat Hurricane one... because it had CAT and I love cats. I am glad I got it because it tasted so good! You definitely can taste the alcohol but it isn't a BLEGH taste. It's the perfect kind of alcohol taste, I don't know how to describe it. We got the $1 dollar shots added to it as well which made it even BETTER :) And if it melts in the Las Vegas sun it just tastes/has the consistency of a \"jungle juice\" type drink. We also got the $8 pepperoni pizza! It was the perfect greasy drunk people food we needed to make sure we had food in our tummy while we got intoxicated. There were four of us in total and we split it at two slices each so it was perfect!
The cup is so cute as well ^.^. I am definitely going back with my cup next time I am in Vegas to take advantage of the discounted refills! The people working there are really nice and funny too! If you are in Vegas YOU MUST GO :D"}
{"text":"Alright, the reviews do not lie.

I've been to Vegas several times, and like a tourist always have to get those stupid cups with the frozen concoction while walking around.

I've been to several places, several cups, plenty of different drinks, but never went to Fat Tuesdays.. until now.

Believe the hype, if you want to get your tourist on, go here. 

You definitely want to start of your Vegas trip right? Get that 190 Octane and an extra shot for only $1 more. I mean how are you going to pass up another shot for only ONE MORE DOLLAR?! Unless your a pussy--cat?

Also keep your cup, just get a refill and you save $2. 

I also tried the Mudslide flavor. It's more of a dessert flavor, you definitely need that extra shot in that flavor.

Don't settle for anything else, you can't be walking around being tourist unless you have a Fat Tuesday cup."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday= Heaven

You can't go wrong with a place that offers 22oz to as much as 48 oz alcoholic beverages. They have a great selection of fruity drinks that will later creep up on you and make for a great, drunk walk down the strip. Before deciding on my drink, I tried out the samples, but my love& obsession for pineapples won out and I got the Amaretto & Pineapple. YUMMY! I had two 22oz Amaretto&Pineapples and let me tell you it made for one interesting day...and night. My friend got the Hurrican-tropical rum wonder! These were hands down the best drinks at Fat Tuesday!"}
{"text":"THE best deal for an alcoholic smoothie!!  My friends and I were fiending for Fat Tuesday, but we didn't know that the place in Planet Hollywood was temporarily closed due to renovations, so we decided to think of some closer alternatives first before having to walk over to Caesar's Palace for this Fat Tuesday.

We walked past all of the other possible smoothie places, but they were all way too expensive!  Up to $40 (or even more) for a yard-long smoothie!  HELL NO.  You could get the same thing or better at Fat Tuesday for almost half that price!!  So we decided to make the trek on over to this Fat Tuesday in the Caesar's Palace forum shops.

So worth it!  I got a half-yard mangoberry (mango+strawberry) smoothie, and it was so yummy!  Some of my friends got the extra shot for $1, which is also a great deal!

Nowhere else even compares!  Yes, they all look like the same product, but Fat Tuesday offers the best prices for high quality drank.  Definitely come here when you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love Fat Tuesday! Hands down my favorite bar on Mill Ave! Great service, good food and good beer. The music selection is nice and the bartenders are excellent and very friendly. I usually get a kiltlifter and something to munch. Their wings are delicious, and so is their fried gator. I tried their fried pickles and wasn't a fan especially because it was served with ranch, I think it was too sour for me. Maybe BBQ might work better or sriracha. I believe the bartender's name was Austin and he was very friendly and did some cool drink making tricks(dont know what they are called). Overall this is a great place to go even for couples."}
{"text":"Alcoholic Frozens are really common in Vegas so it's hard to decide where to actually buy from if you're craving some. Fat Tuesday stands out because they're SO CHEAP. And their flavors are so good. I wasn't expecting them to have so much alcohol either. But my boyfriend and I ended up mildly drunk after having about a yard each. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fat snobby bitch serving the drinks is going thru? If you hate your job quit horrible customer service and she threw my credit card go to school or get a life, unfortunately in Vegas there's stripper standards and your to ugly to make the cut."}
{"text":"Ah! I remember when I was 20, going to Vegas, and eyeing Fat Tuesday longingly. Fast forward 4 years, and I think I just had the best drink mix ever. The girl behind the counter gave us tastings, but you could tell she was rushing us. Understandable, as there is always a crowd at the counter. Kim & I shared the $17 Peach Bellini mixed with the Hurricane. Potent, delicious, and refreshing for a wonderfully sunny day on the strip.

Fortunately:
a) we didn't go with the big almost gallon sized one. it had straps to tie around your neck.. lols
and
b) we already finished shopping... alcohol + forum shops = DANGER DANGER!
c) http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2237/2386343373_2634b2c3d3.jpg

Unfortunately:
a) we weren't headed to clubbing just yet.
b) we were going back to the hotel to meet up (aka wait for the rest of the group)
c) waiting half an hour = sitting around playing with ds
d) waiting half an hour = getting tired
e) i was tired and sleepy and lost my buzz before we even went downstairs to go to the buffet. T_____T

Yay for Fat Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Because I am Fat every day of the week!"}
{"text":"I don't even like fruity cocktails. But I love Fat Tuesday. Mostly because I got hooked up with a bigger size but paid for a smaller size (which I don't know why, but I'm not about to question it).. Haha look who saved $4!

Fat Tuesday is iconic in Las Vegas. You have to get a Fat Tuesday at least once in your life. It's just a thing. Then take pictures with your Fat Tuesday so you can remember that moment when you started getting buzzed off of a blended fruity cocktail. I didn't know it was possible, but it is.

If you're getting dragged by your girlfriends to go shopping, get a Fat Tuesday and you'll have a blast. I got mango and enjoyed it 100% but that's coming from someone who likes mangos. 190 Octane is supposedly the strongest. Oh and you might as well add extra shots to whatever you get, they're only a $1."}
{"text":"Walking around Caesars Palace, I spotted this Fat Tuesday's. I really that they are colorful.

So I saw at a different drink location that they had pink yard cups but Fat Tuesday's didn't. The smaller cups had it in pink so I got that instead. It's so cute but I was disappointed that it didn't light up.

I ordered the pina colada. The worker asked if I wanted a shot for $2 more. I declined, I didn't need to be buzzing faster than usual.

It came out to $11?"}
{"text":"THE quintessential frat boy-esque slushy drink. 

Would you like to get hammered immediately? (ok, not immediately, it takes a while because the cup is a yard long)

Would you like to take one step back from being classy? Put your damn pinky down, you.

Would you like to be able to drink while shopping, thus spending more money than intended?  

There's a large selection of sizes. From my memory, a regular slurpee mug size, the half-yard, the yard, a football-shaped dome, the huge one that's as tall as I am. Ha, yes, my measurement explanations are so helpful.

I got the Amaretto & Pineapple slush mixed in with the Mango slush, which was pretty tasty. \"190 Octane\" is supposedly the strongest, but most of my friends agreed that the orange flavor is \"too much\" half-way through. All in all, it's a sticky, sugary good time.

It's nap time once again."}
{"text":"A Vegas trip isn't complete without having at least one Fat Tuesday a night. Okay, jk. It's not complete without having at least one during your whole trip.

This Fat Tuesday was located right at the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace, so my boyfriend and I headed here after dinner to grab an alcohol filled slushie.

The service here is okay, I guess... The strawberry daiquiri is the best one out of all of them in my opinion. Many different sized and styled souvenir cups to take home with you as well."}
{"text":"The people here are not very attentive when it comes to ordering.  They took my friends order, and then took another person's order whom came in AFTER US.

I would give them 3 stars but I like the concept of hanging large alcoholic drinks around your neck, especially when they are fruity and yummy. 

I ordered the half strawberry / half mango half yard, it wasn't bad, but it tasted so much better after it melted !!!  $13 

Right after I ordered the first one, they gave me a coupon for $1 off, so we used that coupon for the 2nd drink. 
My friend ordered a margarita tasting one, with an extra shot $1. Hers tasted yummy as well, if you like margaritas. 

I want to try the chips, why does no one talk about the chips?? I am going to come here next time to try the chips."}
{"text":"Pretty good slushy drinks definitely a must have went in Vegas or walking up and down the Vegas trip weather is hot or cold outside"}
{"text":"I am now aware of the fact that they do not charge covers on the weekends...

This being the case, I could now possibly see myself dropping by for one cocktail on a Mill avenue binge session, but just one."}
{"text":"BEST FAT TUESDAY ON THE STRIP! It's located next to the Cheesecake factory inside the Caesar's Forum Shops.

The employees here are great and let you try a few different flavors! Besides $5 each for their Hebrew National brand hot dog and cheese nachoes with the fixings is a cheap delicious & unhealthy lunch!"}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot but I still wish that some other bar would just buy them out and replace it with something else.  My friends and I tried this place a couple of years ago and had a bad experience but saw they did some remodeling and thought to give it another try.

PROS: Good music, larger patio (trying to keep up with Canteen and Robbie Foxes)
CONS: Cheap but weak nasty drinks, Rude bartenders and security, sticky/dirty seats, No dancing, just overall negative vibe

Side Story: My wife and I were sitting on the outside front patio and were shocked to see the Security basically pick fights with people leaving the bar.  Two separate people were pushed for leaving through the entrance (easy mistake with no line of people to get in)

If on Mill, plenty of other places with better energy!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, if you have a bunch of friends or co-workers that want to release after work here is the place."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday's is the best at what they do! I love all their drinks! They taste great and get you drunk! Whenever I come to Vegas this is always my 1st stop. I get a drink, usually a yard stick of strawberry and pina-colada, with a few extra shots of course, and it gets me started!!! I don't ever drink there, I just grab the drink and go! One of the best things about Vegas is you can drink in public. Bartenders are always cool and will help you decide what to get. If your in Vegas I highly suggest getting one before you do anything!"}
{"text":"Not a lot to say about this; it does what it says on the tin. The Mudslide was great, the Pina Colada was tasty, and the service was quick and friendly. Please note that if there's a non-drinker in your group they should not fall for the offered Virgin Strawberry; it's just not good without something to cut the sweetness.

Watch out for whichever one is listed as strongest, because they aren't kidding--it's got grain alcohol. Yikes."}
{"text":"I love you more than a fat child loves cake, anime and star wars...combined!!! I mean cm'on how can you go wrong with cheap booze that is served out of 7-11-esque slurpee machines. My friends and I nicknamed the bottles \"yardgaritas!\" !! I tried I few different types and settled on the strawberry daiquiri with an extra shot of 151. Buzzingly-delicious.

Was it the best daiquiri I ever had? No. Was it awesome for the price and convenience? Yes!"}
{"text":"Walked into a very busy bar, and the bar tender stopped and noticed me, and greeted me.  I say myself, but was immediately handed a menu, and offered service.  I think her name was Hannah.  She busted her ass on over 10 different tickets, and was all over the place, but made sure my food was good and my glass was full. I didn't expect much walking in here, but Hannah did an outstanding job.   Great service!"}
{"text":"Great drinks at a great price can be pretty difficult to come by in Vegas, especially on the strip.  So Fat Tuesday is really a nice little find though it'd be diffcult not to notice it with all the people walking around with giant cups.  

I've always been fortunate that when I come by Fat Tuesday, it isn't crowded and there isn't a line going around the corner.  The drinks here are great if you're into frozen mixed drinks, which I clearly am.  My favorite has been the Spring Fling which is a combination of their 190 Octane (Orange Juice and Vodka?) and their Strawberry and Rum concotion.  You can always add an extra shot for $1.00.  I'm not big on the taste of alcohol so this mix was fine for me.  For $20.00 you can drink to your little heart's (read:  liver's) content."}
{"text":"5-stars.  You read that right.  FIVE.

Look.  I'm old enough where recovery from the martinis the night before may take TWO days, not just one.  And that ache from weightlifting at the gym hits me 48 hours later - not immediately the next day. (Only those of you old enough will know what I'm talking about.)   

And still... after all this time, I go to Fat Tuesdays @ the Forum Shops every trip to Vegas.  Here's why:

1) IF YOU'RE YOUNG & HAVE NO CASH...
In my early days, I remember the need for cheap booze & good times.  I also remember a point in my life when my \"recovery time\" was measured in, like, minutes no matter what drinking game I partook in the night before.  After 2 nights of blackjack, I'd be ready for an English Lit final with only a cold shower and a change of boxers.
...LISTEN DORKS:  You can't get any better than Fat Tuesday's for this scenario.  Hardcore \"eff-you-up-like-a-man\" drinks for guys, fruity \"I-can't-taste-the-alcohol\" drinks for the ladies, all for the cost of... a cab ride?  F-CK CABS.  You're young - you can walk back to Circus Circus, El Cortez, or whatever catastrophe you kids are gonna sleep in while in Vegas.

2) IF YOU'RE OLDER & GOING TO THE FORUM SHOPS... WITH CASH!
Now you're a little older, and you've made something of yourself.  Where's your girl gonna go to shop?  Where are you gonna buy some extra Hugo Boss microfiber underwear from?  Where else can you check out that $4000 Panasonic Elite Massage Chair that you keep telling yourself you're gonna buy when you rock the tables at the Venetian?  That's right:  THE FORUM SHOPS.
... LOOK DUDE:  If you're there with your girl, she's gonna ogle the Christian Louboutin heels, then she's gonna do a purse run at Louis Vuitton, and finally she'll settle on spending an hour lookin at fat clothes at Banana Republic.  Meanwhile:
- Where the hell are you gonna be?  Losing money at Caesar's atrocious 6-5 single deck Blackjack tables?
- Where else are you gonna go?  Walk all the way to Cleopatra's to get the same frickin' alcohol for a 100% markup?
You're smarter than that.  So here's a tip:  
There's only 2 places for casual food & drinks in all of the Forum Shops:  That island near the middle, where everything has a massive 200 point mark up - and that includes those Starbucks knockoff cappuccino drinks...
...or Fat Tuesdays which has cheap drinks, coffee, fresh fried potato chips, and a couple big screen TVs to watch the game on.

3) GREAT 'VEGAS-SMART' STAFF
On a serious note, the folks at Fat Tuesday's are ultra cool & friendly.  Just talk to them - I know most of them.  Here's a sample of what you can expect:
M:  Sup Kurt.  You wanna drink?
K:  Do I wanna drink at 10:30AM?  HELL YEAH, I wanna drink.
M:  Cool.  You wanna extra shot of vodka for a $1?
K:  Do I want extra booze for $1?  HELL YEAH, I want extra booze.
M:  Let the party begin.  [Fist bump]
K:  It's on like Donkey Kong. [Fist bump back]
[insert amusing intoxicated discourse here]

They're not pushy, and they're not desperate to make a buck like certain other joints. And they definitely won't \"short pour\" your drink at Fat Tuesdays. 
...Also, all these folks are VEGAS PARTY-GOERS.  They know what night clubs are hot, what lounges suck, and where the good looking strippers go to:  You should leverage them for advice.
...And if you're hungry for a snack, I strongly suggest picking up something here, because seriously:  There's nothing else throughout the whole Forum Shops except for that overpriced island concession stand - check the Directory.

CONCLUSION
This is the oasis in the middle of the commericial desert that are the Forum Shops of Caesars.  Either you KNOW you're gonna want cheap booze, or you KNOW you're gonna be going to Caesar's Forum Shops anyway.  Make it a practice to take advantage of this refreshing watering hole once you reach it and consider it a milestone accomplishment of your trek through the land of upper class Vegas fashion.

5 stars.

Y'KNOW YOU'RE GETTIN' OLD AT FAT TUESDAYS WHEN:
1) You used to hork down 3 Hurricanes.  Now you can't finish ONE.
2) M: \"Dude. Check out the tail.\"  K: \"Wait.  Fiesta Bowl's on.  3rd down.\"
3) Seven words:  No-I-don't-want-the-extra-shot
4) Can't get some drinks; they conflict with your blood pressure meds.
5) You fall asleep in the Fat Tuesday chairs waiting for \"Imelda\" to return"}
{"text":"So happy to see Fat Tuesday on the westside!! I have been to the one in Tempe before so I was excited to visit. I could not be happier with my experience. Rachel was my bartender. I was immediately greeted with a warm welcome and a smile. She had such excitement for the menu items and was very knowledgeable. She helped me step outside of my comfort zone and try some new things. I had the magnum 44 daiquiri and because of her recommendation on food, I am in love with the chicken gumbo pizza! It was such a pleasant experience and Rachel made me feel welcome, as if I were a long lost relative in town for a visit. I will definitely be returning in the future. I found my new spot on the westside."}
{"text":"First time getting myself a yard drink after going to Vegas 7 times now.. YAY!!!!!!

I got the Mango rum with an extra shot for $1.  It wasn't too strong but remember to take out your shot so that it spills out into your cold, refreshing drink!!!

Perfect place for you to start drinking and watch the Caesar's Forum show, which is not that great anyways, but if you haven't seen it.. why not?!?!

Bartenders are awesome and there are flat screens with sports showing."}
{"text":"try the barcardi soaked cherries. good prices. the one over in planet hollywood is a dollar or two cheaper though and you get grain alcohol as the extra shot in the drink. so if youre looking to feel a little more i say go to the fat tuesdays in planet hollywood or luxor. plus they arent as busy."}
{"text":"ive never in my life have a weaker drink. got \"2\" shots cranberry vodka. $10 oy this is why i dont drink in vegas."}
{"text":"Terrible location.  Tucked away in the Caesars Forum Shops where the Cheesecake Factory is, at the end furthest away from an exit to the strip.

But still, any Fat Tuesday is better than no Fat Tuesday!  If you're going to walk the strip, you better do it with a yard in your hand!

I have not tried the chips."}
{"text":"Came out for the first time today.  Had a roast bee panini it was good.  Silvia was the bartender and she was a real sweetheart.  Really friendly and helped me with the menu.  Will be back and try the bread pudding.  Only thing missing is the po boys"}
{"text":"I think I have hated Fat Tuesdays since they started opening in the Valley. The loud music will probably never let you down however. The slushy' are disgusting I really wish they would taste better. I try every few years and nothing changes ....EVER. Best on a hot day if you have to be out in public drinking shitty blended drinks I say."}
{"text":"Oh the joys of alcoholic slushees!!

My friends and I headed to Fat Tuesday for some slushy alcoholic goodness on a lovely Friday afternoon. Drinking at 2 p.m. - woo hoo! I was having a hard time deciding what to order. What was my poison for the day - 151, tequila, rum? Thankfully I noticed a smaller \"mash-up\" menu where you can combine various flavors. I forgot what my mash-up was named, but it did have 151, tequila AND rum. I normally wouldn't dare stomach such a potent concoction, but hey - it's Vegas! The strawberry, orange and mango fruity flavors definitely masked the taste of the alcohol, but I was feeling the buzz after a few sips. With drink in hand, I was one happy camper as I wondered through the Forum Shops. 

For $8, this is a steal - especially considering the steep prices at the clubs and bars."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Service was blah...we were served by the bartender, no sign at the door on what to do as far as seating when you walk in, very off putting, not knowing what to do. After we sat ourselves we waited about 10min no sever, as I got up to ask for help from he bartender came out with menus. After about 10-15min I was going in to ask for help ordering and the bartender came out as I was walking in for out drink orders, our food came 20-30 min after the order was placed. The food was really good which kinda made up for the service. I guess."}
{"text":"You know what they say, a cure to a hangover is more liquor! This place did the trick. I woke up one morning from an intense night of drinking; I wasn't hungover though, I just felt tired and sluggish. A friend of mine called to meet up with me and I ordered the $10.50 strawberry daquiri (no extra shots needed). It was pretty good! My friend ordered the octane with an extra shot of 151. We didn't know that they left the small test tube shot in the drink so not all the 151 came out at the same time. Both drinks were definitely a cure to the intensely hot weather. If we came back, we could've gotten 1 free refill! 

Definitely come back to get more Fat Tuesdays (this was my first one)!"}
{"text":"Cheap drinks and people watching. Plus you get souvenir cups. What more can I say? They were strong and I only needed one to get me drunk, lol."}
{"text":"Great drinks great music..2nd time here and would definitely come here again with friends and family"}
{"text":"I love the frozen daiquiris. So many different flavors & mixes you can try. Bartender was friendly and welcoming. I only had the chips and salsa but it was really good. Def try it"}
{"text":"Patrick is the best bartender at Fat Tursdays!! Y'all should definitely try it out!! Great environment. Party hardy! Go there!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour- half priced daiquiris and munchies, 3.50 wells and beers.  We got catfish bites and peppers.  The catfish melts in your mouth and tastes delicious. Peppers are spicy,  but if you add bacon for an extra dollar the flavor is amazing."}
{"text":"So I figured for my 200th review it needed to be a 5-star rating. I didn't even know I never reviewed this place. Thanks Anne A. for pointing that out haha. 

I'm gonna tell you something, and I'm only gonna tell you once. Don't get the Octane 190. Don't get the Hurricane. Get both. Yes both.

Ok, so I was introduced to the Magnum 44 by my frat bros on a random trip to Vegas. Its a mix of Hurricane and Octane 190 with a shot of Everclear. According to my bros' standards, its supposed to be 3, which i half enjoyed and half regret. If you're looking to get super trashed, this is THE drink to get. I would know, I had it twice in one day and I was sauced the entire afternoon/evening. 23 bucks in their tallest regular bong covers you. 

Because of Magnum 44 I stumbled into a jazz lounge at Bellagio and disrupted the ambiance talking nonsense at the top of my voice. Because of Magnum 44 I walked into the wrong hotel when I was trying to get back to my room. Because of Magnum 44 I threw up in the garbage can in front of the bathroom at MGM Grand and proceeded to finish in the bathroom like nothing happened. Because of Magnum 44 I blurted out in the taxi that I used to think 'this' was 'shit' backwards, but apparently my friend exclaimed that it was. 

Magnum 44 brings good times. I'll be in Vegas in a couple weeks. We will meet again soon Magnum. Cheerio."}

{"text":"I completely agree with Joyhan.... Giddyness is what happens when we see this place.. cause we know fun is just a straw away.... the cherry bombs are great- watch out though.. they'll knock you flat if you're not careful...

last time i went there I got a yard of Strawberry Daiquiri with (count them ladies and gentlemen) 7 of those little tube-y things full of 151 .. i was ABSOLUTELY OBLITERATED... and it was wonderful.

I look forward to my next Vegas-outing so i can hit F.T's first! 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had no clue about the legend that they called Fat Tuesday until I was introduced to this one here in Caesar's Palace. Make no mistake, drinks are pricy no matter where you go in Vegas, but if you are looking for a drunkshitshow, look no further. This is a small spot in the Forum Shops that I've overlooked for quite some time, but the time I spent on that small little corner table will be memorable. Here, it's all about the quantity, and it's all bout how much alcohol you want hanging on your neck when you waddle back onto the strip.

-=-Mud Slide-=- Supposedly, the other locations no longer offer this specific flavor. The mudslide formula seems to be the same anywhere: chocolate-ish milkshake with alcohol. Sounds fab doesn't it? Well, put at least 4 extra shots of alcohol in there and increase the quantity to a full yard hanging around your neck and you'll be living Vegas the right way. Spend a couple moments to marvel at the Caesar statues gallantly displayed around the water fontain, then freak the fuck out when they start moving and spitting fire. Yes, this is a true story only made possible by the ounces and ounces of alcohol consumed here. Enjoy your stay and stay out of the water."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a drink you can cart around and refill for cheap all day while wandering the strip? The service was quick and friendly, the drink was strong enough, it was all good."}
{"text":"Great spot to come for some alcoholic slushies !! They have a huge variety of flavors, and its only $1 more for an extra shot, Its so hard to choose a flavor but the bartenders will be more than happy to let you try samples of them. This location is huge! Good for big groups of parties! They have outdoor seating, nice patio with an outdoor bar, dance floor, dj , flat screen tvs, food and happy hour !! Place was extremely clean and Bartenders had great service! Highly recommend when visiting Tempe

Happy Hour Bar Menu is Really Cheap only $5 for basket of fries, wings and much more!

{"text":"I come to Spring Training every year, there is nothing better than a day in the sun and following it up with some frozen drinks. The alligator nuggets are also awesome. I just got home and I'm already looking forward to next year."}
{"text":"If you have/need to get a booze slushie this is the place. I feel you should do this during your first Vegas trip. In general Fat Tuesday is the most reasonably priced, has the strongest slushies, and is quick to get in and out of. I enjoyed getting a shot of sailor jerry in the hurricane slushie. The stronger the slushie was booze wise the more tolerable it is."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review!!

I came here on a Friday night and this was the first place on my first tour of Tempe (I just recently moved to Phoenix from Virginia).

I also happened to show up the first weekend that school was in session so this place was semi-packed when I walked in at 9 p.m. There was a DJ playing some decent music but the dance floor wasn't crowded at all since it was early.

I got served relatively quickly. Since I was new to the place I asked the bartender for a recommendation and he instantly told me to get the 190 Octane ($5.50)

...I didn't know it had Everclear in it until I grabbed a menu a few minutes later and saw what was in it. Holy smokes! The drink itself was pretty strong, but easy to down because of the slushie-like consistency and orange color and taste. I definitely was feeling GOOD after I left the bar.

There's a good amount of spiked-slushies you can try, so I'll definitely be back to test out some other ones. Check out the list here: http://www.fattuesdaytempe.com/daiquiris.html"}
{"text":"This place is always the to go to place when in Las Vegas. Never lets me down. Great drinks for a reasonable price. The prices obviously depend on the size of the beverage but still pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Every time we're in Vegas, we never fail to stop by Fat Tuesday's for some tasty icy daquiris. We like to go.to this location since it's found near all the stores and we can walk around while sipping on our drinks. Last night I got a mix of the Mango and Bellini with an extra house vodka shot. With the help of their cherry jumbo jello shot and a Ciroc test tube shot, all of us were at a good level at the end of the night and definitely had fun on the strip."}
{"text":"Everytime we come to Vegas, our first stop on the Strip is a to Fat Tuesdays at The Forum!  It's right next to an Express store.  The boys usually get the 1/2 Yard or Yardlong alcoholic slushies with an extra shot.  I take sips here and there and it's really delicious, I almost forget there's a bunch of alcohol in there sometimes... try the Peach Bellini one!

Don't forget to save the plastic bottle so you can get cheaper refills later on!"}
{"text":"The best things about this place are:

-you get a cool souvenir to take home plus you'll fit in with the rest of the LV crowd
-it tastes REALLY good; get a half bellini and half pina colada and whatever show you want to mess you up 
-the drink cools you down as you walk around in the scorching heat
-it's inexpensive; you can probably keep bringing your cup back every time you come to Vegas to get a refill and you'll only spend $10-15 for a LOT.

There isn't much seating but if you do snag one, you can watch that weird and muffled show that happens at the water fountain right in front of Fat Tuesday's."}
{"text":"Alright drinks, but they come out of a slushy machine so they are great for what they are..."}
{"text":"Vibe and music is good here. Service and food on the other hand, I don't wanna tip at all even I still did. I don't know how much salt the cook put in the chicken wrap and fries."}
{"text":"Amazing no mater what flavor or combo of flavors you get. Staff is quick and on point. Other guests on the other hand not so much. Watch out for those that will jump ahead in line or try to grab your drink as your paying. Otherwise, a weekly weekend pit stop for us!"}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place to drink and that's all because of the various frozen daiquiris available never seen a place like it here in AZ ! They usually have the music bumping too!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Always get 1 when I'm in Vegas. I always get the 191 octane with 3 shots added and always leaves me feeling good . Yard dawg for life!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love going to Fat Tuesday, holding a Half-Yard or a Yard-long booze extravaganza, while walking through the Shops at Caesar's Palace in Vegas!  and no, the real Caesar doesn't live here...   anymore....

This place has a large variety of fruity daiquiris, as well as the redbull and coffee flavors.  i personally like the redbull-enriched Raging Bull.  Its like a party in a long tube of booze. 

the location is also great.  you can enjoy your beverage while sitting and watching one of the mini shows in the Shops, if your timing is right.  

The only downside is that this establishment is all the way in back of the shops.  but its Vegas.  Everyone knows going anywhere will take a bit of walking.  but its a great end result if you do make it.  

The Huge Jello shots are pretty cool too.  and, if you want to snack on something, they sell fresh chips as well.  I'd say that's a good combo."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday's is an awesome bar to stop by on any day of the week. Ryan served us and was so welcoming and helpful. Definitely go there and ask for Ryan he's the best."}
{"text":"This location is the only one of the strip with the mudslide flavor.

It's a pain to walk to, but worth it. I come here every time I'm in town. Order a jumbo jello shot. Also worth it. Opt for the extra shot. 2 bucks for extra booze. Who can say no?"}
{"text":"Convenient Fat Tuesday location when you're thirsty from all that shopping in the Caesar's palace shopping forum! :) It's located right next to the cheesecake factory so maybe you can get a slice to go while you get your drank on.

There are a couple of tables and chairs for you to sit while you sip, but my friends and I just prefer to walk around while drinking our adult slurpee. They allow samples of flavors before you pick what you want which is a plus. This is basically slurpees for big kids (adults).

Recommended:
Strawberry and pina colada w/ extra shot of 151. There's already a couple of shots mixed in, but careful with the extra shot. You can either first lift up the test tube so all the alcohol comes out and you can mix it so it won't taste like crap. Or just leave it in the test tube and keep sipping, letting it leak and sink slowly into your cup. However, if you do that method, by the time you get to the bottom of your drink you'll have no \"chaser\" for that shot that's basically accumulated at the bottom of the cup.

Panty Dropper w/ extra shot - it's hurricane mixed w/ bellini. Pretty good and refreshing"}
{"text":"Shannon our server was great. She played along with us while giving her a hard time.  

Drinks were good.  Use the Yelp check in for 50% off.

Food was a little meh. There aren't too many options. We did get tortilla chips and artichoke dip. Good by not worth $10. 

The manager was cool too. Real personable, was willing to give a happy hour discount slightly after the time was up because we waited a little bit before getting a server."}
{"text":"Bartender was excellent. They have so many options. Was recommended to try the Magnum with the extra shot! It was delicious! Best part, you walk out to the fountain and get a show at the top of every hour. Fat Tues is def one if those places you always need to stop in for every trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Nothing is hotter than holding those bong-shaped plastic slushy holders and sipping from a pink straw like you are a bad ass . . . 

NOT.

The staff were friendly and helpful, I told them that I wanted Grey Goose in a 20 oz bottle and they accommodated me well (especially after telling me there are a jillion sugar calories in the frozen drinks) and I loved the white cheddar chips! Way to go, calories!

We chilled outside and people watched for 2 hours. Hilarious times.

Love Fat Tuesdays and will reuse our 20 oz plastic cups for the next adventure!"}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday is a fine destination on a nice sunny Saturday afternoon because you can sit on the patio and enjoy the people watching that abounds on Mill Avenue. IThe small menu contains a handful of items 95% of which are fried, which is great when you are drinking. No complaints on the mozzarella sticks from me!  My huge problem with Fat Tuesday are their beer prices...$4 for a Bud Light bottle. That is just absurd in my opinion considering I could just walk down the street and get a $5 pint of Harp at Rula Bula.  I haven't tried the slush drinks yet, but perhaps on the next nice Saturday afternoon I am on Mill, I will because I am guessing they are a better deal in terms of price and alcohol content.  They were quite popular with our friends last time we were there.

Fat Tuesday isn't a reason to go to Mill, but an adequate stop if you are there and just want a drink or two on a sunny spring day."}
{"text":"The freezes are awesome. Any combination you can think of, you could have here. You can keep the cups depending on what size you pick. Always a spot my best friend and I go to whenever she's in town. Laid back spot to catch up. Buffalo dip and their ceviche is yummy!"}
{"text":"Gotta try the Octane 190. The Yard sized drink is about $16, which is reasonable for the Strip.

It may be tricky to find at first, but it's located in the back of the Forum shops by the Nike and Cheesecake Factory.

Go get one of these, load up on an extra shot or two. Sip and enjoy a stroll down the strip.  Before you know it, you'll be buzzing like hell. 

Watch out for brain freeze!"}
{"text":"My Favorite place to grab a drink!!! 

How to get sloshed in Vegas on a budget once you arrive from the airport:

1) Land at the airport
2) Holla at a taxi driver and say \"Take me to Motha F-in Fat Tuesday's\" (There are four locations so it shouldn't be hard to find one. Each one is in a major hotel on the strip.)
3) Order the 190 Octane or the Hurricane and ask for two 151 beeker shots...go ahead and splurge they're only a dollar per shot
4) Drink as fast as you can
5)Attempt to check in at your hotel sober and have a swirly head day!

great tasting, and comes in a variety of flavors + I seem to have good luck when carrying one around while gambling...don't hold me to that though...but yeah...it never hurts to give it a try"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a while before heading to the airport. Great deals on Tuesdays and pretty decent bar food. The bartender was super nice and engaging. It was in the middle of the day so I'm not sure how the night time scene is."}
{"text":"Cheapest place to get your tall VEGAS DRINKS to walk up and down the strip!

Order the Octane 190. Strongest drink and the most popular (I wonder why). It may not taste like it but it sure crept up on me!

They have free samples.

Beware...the blue one makes your mouth, teeth and tongue - everything VERY BLUE!

Add extra shots for $1 each!

They have $1 jello shots too!

We got the 1/2yard (32oz) for $12. came back the next day and got a refill for $10! Ohh yeah!"}
{"text":"You don't charge $16 for very little, bland tasting crawfish! The crawfish itself was small too. I don't think i had more than 11 whole crawfish. I wish I can post a picture to justify my disappointment."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great music. Definitely come thru during happy hour times . 

Will highly recommend to anybody"}
{"text":"So happy this location finally opened!  Rachel and  Micki are the best bartenders in west gate!  Atmosphere is awesome, food and drinks are amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious and well worth the price. We got a tumbler sized which was perfect to share between two people when we wanted something to drink but didn't want to get super buzzed. Make sure to get the refillable cup if you think you'll come back!"}
{"text":"My date drank so many margaritas, she left abruptly, threw up on the sidewalk, fell and passed out right next to her vomit. The reason why this happened is because they are delicious and go down so smooth! Defintely recommend but pace yourself, I'm not calling your friend to help me take you home again, Lindsey."}
{"text":"Drinks and snacks, but drinks you cant get in other places.  Dont forget to try a jello shot made with Everclear."}
{"text":"The one \"Vegas\" thing I wanted to do the night before we left Vegas was to get a drink from Fat Tuesday. (What else is more tourist-y than drinking a yard long alcoholic slush.. in Vegas?)

Seeing how the closest Fat Tuesday to us at the time was in Caesars Palace, we walked in through the front doors. We walked and walked and walked.. and walked some more.. before finding it in the really end of the shopping center. But, finding it = jackpot! The place was kind of small, but alas, the line wasn't that long. Each yardstick was $18.. which was a little bit pricey, but hey, it's alcohol and you're paying for the experience, right?

For those of you that want to get a \"kick\" out of the drink, buy extra shots! I think they were an extra $1. I wish I got an extra shot! But I ain't complaining because this is just an excuse to go back to Vegas.. :)"}
{"text":"I have been here for new year 2018. I was not happy coming to Phoenix as I am from LA where I can find so many places to have fun for new year. But, to celebrate with friends, decided for Phoenix. The moment I reached Tempe I was so shocked to the crowd. After entering \"Fat Tuesday\" , I felt it's too small and how can we have fun. But , there was an indoor and outdoor DJ. I had so much fun with the DJ and fun with frz. I was not disappointed and happily welcomed my new year."}
{"text":"i love the strawberry daiquiri!

bartender: do you want a double shot?
my friend and i: SUREEEEEEEEE!!

good stuff. quick customer service too."}
{"text":"LOOOOOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Best mix for me is the strawberry and pina colada. STRAWBERRY COLADA!! Woot woot!! 

I just wish they stayed frozen for a longer time, or maybe because I'm a slow drinker, but they melt too fast!!! grrr"}
{"text":"This Fat Tuesday is located inside of the Caesar's Palace hotel on the strip. You have to go to Fat Tuesday when you're in Vegas; it's a must. This is not the only Fat Tuesday on the strip but I decided to go to this one because I love walking around Caesar's Palace. 

Caesar's Palace is HUGE so don't get discouraged when you're walking around looking for Fat Tuesday (if it's your first time going). When I was looking for this Fat Tuesday my first time, I thought maybe I had misinformation about where it was but I ended up finding it! 

If you love slushy drinks that taste fruity and delicious, then this is the place for you. You really can't taste the alcohol very much. I really can't even taste it. This is a blessing and a curse. It can definitely sneak up on you if you drink one too many of these. Forget the fact that there is a ton of sugar because calories don't count when you're in Vegas!!

There are so many flavors to choose from. In addition to that, you can choose from a variety of cup sizes. The drinks are pre-made in slushy machines, just like at the movie theater when you order an Icee. 

The staff is super friendly and lets you sample different flavors, which is really nice. You don't want to spend a bunch of money on a huge drink and end up not even liking it. 

I come here every time I come to Vegas and I love it and I will continue to do that every time I take a trip here."}
{"text":"I was here on a Saturday afternoon after we had just eaten at Hot n Juicy. Right as I checked in there was a deal being offered for 1/2 price drinks. So, that was pretty sweet. I got an order of the 190 high octane drink which you can never go wrong with. Couple of friends I was with got the bomb pop drink. The place was pretty much empty, but hey it was a Saturday afternoon so it was probably a different type of atmosphere at night. So, when we were there it was still laid back and had a very chill vibe to it. Almost like a little kick back. We also decided to try the atomic cherries. Man, those are always fun, lol. 

The bartender was very cool and kept us engaged and we never felt like we were being ignored even though there were only at max maybe 8 people there. He was professional and made sure we were taken care off. They had Happy Hour that started at 4pm that day with 1/2 off drinks. Can't beat a happy hour like that! They also had a pretty dope patio setting which will be an even better place to chill at when the weather here starts cooling down a bit.Other things I noticed was the other employees were also nice and professional. It has ample space because after we left I think they were hosting a NFL Draft Party and looks like they kept their place clean."}
{"text":"This is my very first time here as a tourist from the Bay Area.... i came to Mill Ave and I decided to come to Fat Tuesday...best decision I could have ever made! I ended up trying the amazing Fat Tuesday Daiquiri bar....I must say thank goodness my friend drove because they certainly wasn't stingy with the \"Sause\" unlike some places where you have to order 3 drinks only to get a slight \"Buzz\"....the cherry on top of the amazing pie was that my Server HEAVEN was extremely helpful in assisting me with making a decision among their vast verities....She was simply  \"Amazeballs\" ! ! I'm a huge service snobb and she past my  standards with flying colors and then some....I will most definitely be back here when I come back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday!

If you love sugar alcohol or blizzards with alcohol then this is the place! 

This is in the Forum Shops of Caesar's Palace, near the end where the show is on the fountain. This is next to Bath and Body Works as well!

The sizes...
20 oz- $9
22 oz- $11
32 oz (half yard!)- $14
48 oz- $18

I got the bellini which is champagne and peach schnapps. That's the fancy word you wanna say to sound all professional. Plus it's really fun to say. Schnapps. Hehhehe. It's sweet and you don't taste the alcohol at all, which I guess is what I want haha. :P It's fun to drink, but it's more like a swirly rather than complete liquidy. :( That was something I wasn't really expecting haha. You should get the yardlong. It's not even that bad, unless you have no tolerance at all. I have barely there tolerance. You feel nothing :)

Enjoy and drink! You'll love the sweetness if you like fruity alcoholic drinks.

They also have pina colada :DDDDD"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon taking a break from studying from finals... I walked in and was greeted by Brandon the bartender in shift.

Unlike most of the assholes I have encountered in Arizona...keep doing your thing man!!! I will be a drunk customer"}

I thought we as a society have come further than these types of remarks are we are for sure letting all our heterosexual and Gay and Lesbian friends to stay away from your establishment.  SHAME ON YOU FOR EMPLOYING PEOPLE THAT THINK THEY CAN REFER TO PEOPLE IN THIS MANOR AND STILL HAVE A JOB!"}
{"text":"i went here this past Saturday and the place was packed. I went to the bartender to get some drinks and ordered some jello shots (15) to be exact. The bartender starts handing them to me and I asked if someone could take them to the patio for us. He belligerently said he wouldn't and passed me off to an even ruder server who totally rolled her eyes!! Too bad b/c me and my crew love to drink......and tip well. Don't these people work for tips. But I guess I forget it was Mill and most  of them are probably college students - good luck paying for it! HA!"}
{"text":"Not lesbian/gay friendly at all. I should have read the previous review before going."}
{"text":"This review is only for the Chippery, not the daiquiris. (Though I bet they are delicious!) 

I was wandering around the Forum Shops and I wanted just a little snack before heading home. My friends were getting daiquiris and I saw they have food in the back so I shoved my way through all those wanting frozen drinks and went back. I was pleasantly surprised at the chip selection. They had 6-8 flavored of homemade chips for really reasonable prices, $3 or $5 per bag depending on size. 

The only reason that it gets less than 5 stars is that the service wasn't great. Not cheery people this afternoon at Caesars! It is definitely a hidden gem for a cheap little snack."}

I was told by this person that all restaurants have a bug problem and that we did not see a rat. Who was I to believe MY OWN EYES or This guy ?
I could not believe that he told us not to make a scene and to leave. We were more than happy to leave. With rats and roaches we will not be back ! I have not been in Tempe AZ that long but does anyone know who I should report this too ? Who do I call ?"}

Its as if they make it weak so you can just get a shot on the side.

Not a true Vegas turnup"}
{"text":"I've been to New Orleans and I've seen the kinds of people that purchase the special \"go\" cups from the alcoholic slushy vendors that line Bourbon Street. There assholes; all of them. There the same kinds of people we all know...the kind that never get invited back to parties that you throw. There that guy/girl that get their weeble on way too early in the night and end up spilling something that is red, blue or green in color all over your brand new, mostly white kicks. These people are 99% of the patrons of Fat Tuesdays' on Mill Avenue.

I had exactly one legitimate use for Fat Tuesdays in my life; my 21st birthday. During which I sucked down one of their god awful grain liquor concoctions, got brain freeze, bought random people atomic cherries, made out with a fat girl and projectile vomited a strange orange-brownish ichor all over the men's room shitter. Then I went to a sleazy strip club, which was money much better spent.

No respectable person, with the noted exception of celebrating their 21st birthday, should ever patronize this place. Based on a simple algebraic formula there technically shouldn't be enough 21st birthdays to keep this place in business. This vortex of suck has been around longer than any other bar on the Mill avenue strip (see: Casey Moore's is not on Mill) and is an anomaly that goes against the laws of time and space; Einstein is very upset. If you are a regular to this place and not some kind of being from an alternative universe or celebrating someone's 21stbirthday you are dead to me.

On a final note; if you are a being from an alternative universe please get in contact with me. I've got a few questions I'd like to ask you."}
{"text":"I like dive bars as much as the next guy, but this place made me feel rather dirty just for being in there.  I sat with my girlfriend at the outdoor patio, and a large crowd circled around a few tables decided to have an ice cube fight.  The servers came and went while this was going on, but didn't seem to care and didn't do anything about it, even though the ice was hitting innocent bystanders (such as me and my girlfriend).    The various pre-made frozen drinks seem like a fun concept, but this place really does strike me as a true armpit.  Avoid."}
{"text":"I went to AZ to visit some friends, and on our first night out, they insisted we head to fat Tuesdays. Luckily when we got there, it was happy hour. The prices were very reasonable, the drinks were tasty, and the food was great too. Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with a Fat Tuesdays. It's always a must when you're in Vegas. The hours are perfect for most people in Vegas. The only part I was bummed about was they don't have the chippery here any more and that was the main reason I came to this Fat Tuesdays. Now they only have a store bought bag of chips. Other than the chippery everything's else in this FT location is great."}
{"text":"Of course this is a hotspot but, can we upgrade the music to something beyond 2007. How many times do I need to hear usher - yeah or the cupid shuffle? \"yeah the cupid shuffle\" coming from LA all the drinks are much cheaper so you won't be hearing me complain. There was a large turnout on a Saturday night. Place could stand a good cleaning."}
{"text":"Refreshing slushy with alcohol?  Yes, please. A vegas must any time of year. Mudslide is my favorite and my wife loves the peach bellini. Keep your cup and bring it back with u for a discount."}
{"text":"So I was in Vegas for the first time ever this weekend!  After reading countless reviews at different places I planned on visiting, I had very high expectations for the 44 Magnum.  Im not real hard to please, nor am I a critic who enjoys writing negative reviews.  I seriously went in and purchased the Magnum 44 yard with my girl and neither of us felt anything, and yes, we asked for a  shot of everclear.  It just tasted like a slushee with a slight bite to it...Im not a lightweight but I still was expecting A LOT more from this revered drink.  My advice is to just gamble and enjoy free drinks in the casino ( $1 w/ tip for the waitress), unless your in it for the novelty of having a fruity slurpee drink.  Part of me thinks maybe I should have gotten 3, now that I am re-reading that post by Loren B. , but the reasonable side of me is saying 2 more shots wouldn't have done anything for a buzz that wasnt' there to begin with.
:-("}
{"text":"OK so can you really so anything bad about Fat Tuesday I mean it'd alcohol in all flavors!! There is alcohol in these drinks and you can add extra shots!!! Prices are good and they have any size you want. Love Fat Tuesday!!! Its also really fun to watch the tourist that visit here!"}
{"text":"What can I say? If you want to get destroyed on a decent dime and enjoy it, come to Fat Tuesday. Yummy slushie drinks galore! And you can reuse the cups and save some money. Can't come to vegas without a stop here!"}
{"text":"Majority of mixes @ Fat Tuesday have rum in them, but you have vodka and bourbon as well.

Happy Hour is from 4-7pm everyday ! Got the Honey Sriracha wings with chips and salsa. 

Music is a good mix and sets the mood, recommend for a spot to hang out and enjoy good weather."}
{"text":"Very few places in the world (my scope only encompasses Las Vegas and MA) can you order a 3' or taller beverage containing 10 or more shots of grain alcohol.

My favorite Fat Tuesdays in Vegas is the one at Ceasers Palace. Ive gotten shitfaced with friends consuming drink after drink staring at the fire and water battle of the gods automated \"puppet\" show and forget. \"did we see this twice or 13 times so far today?\"

Getting obliterate in a mall setting is perfect for making other purchases as well. Normally having a rational sense of \"hmm 1000 dollars is a lot for a sunglasses?... to \"oh fuck it, just get it\" and then we did.

No idea how the chips are, the room in my belly's only for booze.  if i want to eat I would go to hash house a go go and bring my fat tuesdays drink in with me. 

Its vegas so you can do pretty much what ever you want such as walk in while drinking,smoking a cigarette, wearing ridiculous gucci sunglasses, a crappy neon tank top with profanity on it. Cut-off acid wash jeans and black socks and flip flops. I love Vegas, Also a side note. 

you can play a drinking game with you and your friends all you need is friends and drinks as you walk around.2 rules. Drink every time you see an affliction,tap out or ed hardy shirt. and take a shot if any of those people have a foe-hawk. (so many douche bags)"}
{"text":"On my trip to Vegas I definitely had to try Fat Tuesdays! I read in the reviews that it's super sweet and you can't taste the alcohol, which is perfect for me since I hate the taste of alcohol and I'm also super lightweight. There was a big long line when we got there and it moved SUPER slowly. They do let you sample all of them which is nice. We ended up getting the mango and peach. I actually couldn't drink that much of it because I thought it tasted too strong...I guess I just have different taste because most of the reviews say it's too sweet which I don't agree with at all. That being said, I wasn't a huge fan of the drink but I do like their cups, it definitely screams Vegas."}
{"text":"Awww Fat Tuesday is like a tradition for every legal first time vegas visitor. This time it was my little sister and her friend. I have a first-time system for vegas get there and have a chill first day/night then have the rager of a night. So the best first time place is Fat Tuesday cause you can comeback and refill it the next day. 

So this is not my go to FT but I have yet to be disapointed in any of them. So intake my sister and her friend  and I offer to buy their first drink. Being the lushes they are they go big and demand the extra shots. I laugh in my head and say this will be the last thing you remember. Staff laughed at what I said and poured away. Great service but not as talkative as the other FT. Well like I said they drank it and forgot the night. So in other words FT delivered again thank you."}
{"text":"So yummy. So thick and a good amount of alcohol. Add on a tube and you're good to go. This will in fact give you a brain freeze so go slow! The electric lemonade's my fav."}
{"text":"Super packed with the line going outside! Either this location is super popular or everyone came to watch the game. 

I got the $12.00 size with bellini and an extra shot. If you want to get tipsy, I totally recommend that you get an extra shot or two. They're only $1.00! I also noticed their food menu.  Pizza and hot dogs. I believe their 190 Octane is supposed to be their strongest flavor. They have a bunch of different flavors and sizes you can choose from. I love this place because they offer a wide variety and the prices aren't bad.

I got four of their jello shots, $2.00 each. Yuck! We were disappointed because it tasted off and it was so hard to eat. We needed spoons or something. It was actually pretty funny. A table of girls tonguing the heck out of their jello shots. After awhile, my friends gave up and we all tossed what was left over into the trash.

I'll be sticking to the bellini! No jello shots for me from this place."}
{"text":"These drinks are such a creeper it's wonderful. Ordered the blueberry one in a half yard and had a good buzz off of it. The drink itself was strong but after a few sips you get used to it. It's a perfect yummy treat for the hot summer Vegas days. I did not know that you can sample at least two flavors before committing, so I will be sure to do so next time I'm in town! Drinks can be a bit on the pricey side but then again you're in Vegas, everything is over priced."}
{"text":"cheap drink specials and front/backside patio is what makes this place tolerable.  

This place has loud music and is unoriginal for the most part but I still had an alright time.  The 150? octane drinks will get you going for the night and they use to have 50 cent bud on tuesday nights back in my day."}
{"text":"They make their drinks strong and they have huge nachos."}
{"text":"The security was outrageous, coming to the states the American boarder asked for less ID. Passports are pretty legit. Do I look like the kind of person who wants to be detained in both the US and Canada? 
The drinks were good, worth the money? No. 
The bartender spent most of the night (and by night I mean the whole 45 minutes I could stand it there) throwing around cups and attempting to flair bottles. Many cups hit the ground. He cared more about trying to show off than actually helping people which is probably why I didn't tip, which is something I need a real reason to do.
Verdict: I won't be back. 
Recommendation: If you're looking to over spend and be ignored all night this is the place for you! If you're looking for people to do their jobs and pay a little less it's mill street, walk around and follow the crowd."}
{"text":"Love this place! Jason was a huge help and great at helping me pick out what flavor I wanted!"}
{"text":"One word \"WOW\" amazingly tasty perfect for a drunken hangover. While the earth is sizzling hot gulp down one of their famous margarita's and sip slow... you'll surely end up nicely drunk but by all means stay away from eating buffet style afterward (Do not attempt) such a mistake... But so good!"}
{"text":"This is my new Vegas touchstone. Itinerary will read: arrive Las Vegas, check into hotel, walk to the nearest Fat Tuesday & partake. I recommend the 36 oz reusable cup! The other souvenir cup that holds the same volume of your choice of delicious ice-cold slushie is a bit unwieldy. I'm just saying that it won't fit in your cup holder in the car. Not that it should when it's carrying an alcoholic beverage...

I've tried the following: strawberry with rum, piña colada, Miami Vice (mix of strawberry and piña colada), 190 Octane (whooo), Hurricane, and a bright blue mixture that tasted like it was just that: bright blue. I personally am more of a fan of the strawberry, piña colada, and Miami Vice because a sip won't necessarily overpower me. Though I did get my first Fat Tuesday drink with a shot of Everclear. That was a surprisingly powerful kick, when I finished my blended drink only to slurp up half a shot of Everclear grain alcohol.

Anyway, from now on I refuse to walk anywhere in Vegas without a Fat Tuesday drink in my hand. To those who've never been, I'd describe it as a cross between a 7-Eleven and a bar. I wish all Slurpees tasted this good."}
{"text":"FAT TUESDAYS FOR YOU, FAT TUESDAYS FOR ME, FAT TUESDAYS FOR EVERYBODYYY!

If you're in Vegas, Fat Tuesdays is a must, period.  It's been a tradition for me since my very first trip here after turning 21 couple years ago.  
I mean, seriously.. what better way to cool off from that blazing Vegas heat than a icy cold slushie mixed with tons of booze.  You're cooling off and turning up at the same damn time.  Sounds like a good time to me :)  

On my most recent visit here, I tried the Mudslide flavor upon recommendation from a friend and holy smokes, I've found my favorite.  For me personally, I can't sip on drinks--wine, beer, mixed drinks, you name it.  I actually cringe at the taste of alcohol and would rather take shots to get it done and over with.  The Mudslide flavor literally tastes like chocolate milk!  The alcohol taste was very faint but it definitely gave me a buzz!  I also recommend you add an extra shot to it! Do it, do it!

They have a ton of other flavors you can choose from.  I've also tried Pina Colada and Peach Bellini-those were also really good too but I couldn't enjoy them as much because my boyfriend and friends always add an extra shot to it and the alcohol taste is much stronger in those drinks compared to the Mudslide.  

Prices are reasonable--remember, you're in VEGAS.  Save your cup and bring it back for a refill which is a couple dollars cheaper.  I recommend a half yard to share with 1 other person."}
{"text":"Read reviews of this place and decided to get an \"adult slushie.\" For the price, I can't really complain. The place was packed and they offer a multitude of flavored. I ended up getting the pina colada, and it was the perfect balance of alcoholic and the mix. I enjoyed it and it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love alcohol and want some cheap drinks? This is definitely a place you need to visit as they have everything from small mugs all the way up to huge 100z containers for fueling your drink on! And as for the drink variety, there is a nice little menu sitting outside the venu to look at for possibilities that may catch you thirst.

I went with 190 octane, as they stated it is their strongest drink (later found out the .44 magnum is actually the king of this place). I decided to go with the 100oz ($37). That really draws attention as you walk through hotels and the Blvd. Plus it helped keep us cool as we hotel hopped. Defeinitely wanting more of this place!

And the best part? You don't think there's enough alcohol in your drink? Buy a shot! They'll fill a beeker with your choice and toss it into your drink for added potency. Good times!"}
{"text":"Being in this bar makes me feel dirty. There are always the creepiest of the creepy guys inside and the girls that look like their fake IDs weren't good enough to get them into a good bar on Mill. The music is always insanely loud (and not even good, usually). 

Highlight: the outdoor patio. I'm a sucker for outdoor dining/drinking"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Fat Tuesday location in Vegas. Great people (fish and animatronic) watching spot! 

And they give you coupons to use for future purchases at not only their location but others. No others had done that before in all my Vegas Fat Tuesday visits! Its def worth the walk and there's rarely a line!"}
{"text":"My favorite place on all of Mill! Alcohol slushies- try the 190 Octane with Everclear!!!

You have to get the loaded nachos, too! So good. And the queso is to die for!!! Fresh cut jalapeños and layers or toppings, not just piled on top. They also have chili cheese fries!!"}
{"text":"Normally wouldn't stop by here, but I was entertaining an out of town friend and showing her around.  Fat Tuesday has somewhat become a staple to buy and sip on while walking on the strip.  For those of you who don't know what a Fat Tuesday is it's basically a slurpee with alcohol in it.  Nothing mind blowing about it, it's more of a novelty item really. This Fat Tuesday is located inside the Forum Shops by the Bath and Body Works and Nike Store.  Came here a little after 9:30 pm and it was empty.  

They have plenty of different flavors to pick from.  I got the Mangoberry Mash-Up in the stadium cup size for $9.  I'm not sure if it was because I ordered the smaller cup but I felt like mine didn't have any alcohol in it.  I also think I got a defective cup and lid because it kept dripping down my hand and arm while walking around.  Regardless it was a tasty treat to sip on and helped cool me down while walking around in the heat.  If you are looking for the typical Vegas experience come here and enjoy an adult slurpee!"}
{"text":"My Favorite Combo:

Mardi Gras + Electric Lemonade + x amount of shots of 151

Another part of my Vegas ritual"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great drinks. Fantastic food. Made from scratch my girlfriend and I had the buffalo chicken fries and every empanada they had and all of it was great. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I love Vegas!  What other city in the world can you walk the streets with a monstrous novelty bucket full of fruit flavored alcoholic frozen goodness?

Here's some advice though:

If you are in the mood for a gigantic novelty frozen drink, do yourself a favor and walk your ass over to the nearest Fat Tuesdays.  There is one at the MGM Grand downstairs shops, one at the Caesar's Forum Shops Mall, one at the Planet Hollywood Desert Passage Mall, and likely a few others scattered around the city.

For $17, you get a colossal sized novelty glass of frozen drink mixed with your favorite alcoholic beverage.  There are smaller sizes available, but it's Vegas, so you gotta go big!  You can get an extra shot of alcohol for $2, which is a no-brainer LDO...

As far as recommendations... The 190 Octane (Orange Juice + Vodka) allegedly has a higher alcohol content, but, for my money, you cannot go wrong with the Cat 5 Hurricane (Fruit Punch + Baccardi 151).  I can say from first hand experience, that the Cat 5 Hurricane with an extra shot will eff your ish up!

Do not accept cheap watered down imitations!  I have tried the frozen drinks all over Vegas, and for the most part, the ones at the casinos resort bars tend to be super weak and essentially $20 slurpees.  The list of pretenders include the bar at Paris, at MGM Grand toward the pool, and bar outside Imperial Palace.

When in Vegas, it's Fat Tuesdays or bust, son!"}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday is all around awesome! I love the vibe. The food is amazing and the service is out standing! They just opened to the public yesterday and they were busy! The bartenders were amazing fast at getting to people and great drinks. They were dancing and having fun! It's almost like it wasn't a job to them!! Dj was awesome all Kinds  different music but fun upbeat music!"}
{"text":"Johnnie was an incredible bartender. She knows how to sell you on extra shots, and recommends things that she likes. She's the girl to go to when you're in westgate. Come throughout the week, and she'll hook you up. Definitely will be recommending the westgate location to all of my friends. Will be here frequently."}
{"text":"I thought this was a gay bar... Uncle Stinky Poo has been trying to convince me that it is not. 
Maybe if they lost the blacklights, wild neon colors, and the techo dance-music track from 2003, I might believe him."}
{"text":"Want to get drunk? I mean falling over, possibly having sex in public...but you're not sure if that really happened drunk?

This is the place.

Described aptly as \"7-11 on acid\" the giant bank of alcoholic slurpee, er daiquiri, machines is a sight to behold! Try to catch a glimpse of the inner workings while waiting for the men's room (its fine to go into the locking one ladies) its kind of crazy in there! All sorts of whirring machines and people leaping around with gallon buckets of daiquiri mixes, or stirring 50 gallon vats of daiquiri mix that recently had an obscene amount of liquor dumped into it.

Wait a minute! They don't only have daiquiri drinks! They've got a full bar! They've got food too? WTF? Fats actually has a pretty good kitchen. If you come in for lunch, sit at the bar. The servers really aren't interested...honestly this is probably one of the worst places in the world to be a server. Go to the bartenders, they are happy.

Remember though, the whole point of this place is to get you drunk. They know their job well. They have levers to pull on a bank of machines that makes drunks, they hand you a glass of something that is generally over 150 proof (75% ABV). The most famous drink is the 190 Octane, it really is 190 proof (95% ABV) then you can get everclear soaked cherries as well...

I have never left this place sober."}
{"text":"My friend insisted to get those big margarita cups everytime when he's in Vegas and they are expensive, so I yelped and found this place in Caesars.  Its nice that they let people sample (and they do check ID) so we tried few flavors before we ordered.

Pina Colada is good, it goes well with strawberry daiquiri but my friend wanted Orange (yea he's weird) so it tasted kinda off.  Add some shots to make add the fun to it.  

Their price isn't as bad as other places, I would say come here if u want the frozen margaritas."}
{"text":"I love it! You're in Vegas, of course you have to get a yard drink! And who better to get one from than Fat Tuesday? Extra shots for a couple bucks? Hell yeah, why not? Beats how much you'll have to fork over for a drink at the Vegas clubs later that night."}
{"text":"Came on Saturday, happened to be happy hour so $6 daiquiris for med and large sizes. And cheaper finger foods.

I got blue razz, Lynchburg lemonade, and jungle juice. All were very good and strong. 

The apps we got were the chicken wings $7 and chips and salsa $4 a decent amount and good. 

Good for the price. Probably would only come for happy hour for food but the servers are great very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"When in Vegas it is only right to enjoy a few adult beverages. I ordered the magnum which is rum and everclear. I don't usually drink dark liquor and I definitely don't drink everclear but let me tell ya..this beverage was just what I needed. You can add a shot for $2 but I decided against it because I knew this would be just enough and I was right. I'm not a heavy drinker but it was plenty for me. I'd definitely order it again"}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday is my friend's favorite place in Vegas. Every time we come to town, he has to get a FT and we go out of our way to find one of its 5 locations. He loves the Hurricane. You get an extra shot for a buck. I prefer the Bellini and the Cajun Bloody Mary. Save the cups because you can get refills for a few dollars off."}
{"text":"What can I say about all 'Fat Tuesdays'?! All flavors are good! Always make sure to add that 151 shot for a $1 more....I mean why not, right?!! I usually get the 2nd to the biggest container until I get to the next 'Fat Tuesday' store..."}
{"text":"Great bar, great music. The drinks are pretty decent. I normally order a vodka tonic, or Jameson on the rocks. Depending on who's bar tending, my vodka tonic would be either watered down or strong like I like it. Only downside I would say is that there's a boxing machine that measures how hard you hit. So on occasion you will get some college kids in there trying to show how \"tough\" they are in front of everyone."}
{"text":"Great specials! $5 daiquiris in so many flavors. We tried the blue raspberry. It was huge- enough for us both to share. Nice ambience with indoor and outdoor seating. Three stars because the servers could have been much friendlier. The bar wasn't even busy and the service was cold. But the drinks were tasty, so overall it was a good experience. Would go back- but I was just visiting the Tempe area."}
{"text":"This is the best place to start your day in Vegas. Since nobody is up early in Vegas. I like the 190 octane, 151 hurricane, 44 magnum, and Miami vice. I usually drink one there get a refill than back over to Caesars to do a little gambling. Then when I'm empty I get it filled back up again. They are strong and worth the money. If you plan to drink a bunch of these get a refillable cup but not one that is too big. Also get the extra shot. It's only a dollar more"}
{"text":"guaranteed good time. get the tall $17 size with $1 extra shot. for a dollar a shot might as well buy $3 worth. what's 3 more dollars when you're already spending 17, make it an even 20. when in vegas do as..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get drinks. Fat Tuesday is a must if you're in vegas (or something similar). It's an experience on it's own with many different flavors and combinations to chose from. I got the half yard long and it got me on a good level, but next time i think i'll go for the yard lol. The price isn't bad and it's a delicious drink to sip on while walking around the casinos or even out on the strip. 
Just don't go over board with the drink, otherwise you might end up on a rooftop! lol jk.
I recommend anyone over 21 to try a fat tuesday if they're ever in vegas."}
{"text":"We spent New Years here for '12 and it was a pretty darn good time...If you came early. The crowd got so out of control that you couldn't dance and you ended up paying a $40 cover charge. The reason why it's so popular here is there frozen alcoholic drinks that range anywhere from 190 Octane (151 Rum) to some mild 80 proof rum concoction. They also have a full bar if the frozen thang ain't your thing. Nice outside patio area that allows you to gaze at the hammered ASU students and sit under a nice heated lamp."}
{"text":"Every flavor is to die for and the price is pretty reasonable for what you get. Staff is friendly and easy to ask for recommendations. I got the mix of two flavors, strawberry and piña colada. I could drink these every day and I want to go back to Vegas just because of these!"}
{"text":"Went to the one @ the Forum Shops in Ceasars...Awwww Yessss What I look forward to when visiting sin city....A Nice Alcoholic Slurpee to quench my thirst!! Oh yeah!!! YUM! If I wanna quick buzz, i go for the 190 Octane with a shot of everclear! Yeah, that's how i roll!! But this time around I went for a Bellini w/ da shot! Tasty and refreshing!!! I think that was my 4th buzz of the day.....Fat Tuesday + Friends = Fun!!!"}
{"text":"Certain place on the patios you literally cant here yourself talk none the less your friend. The slushies are pretty awesome. (Strawberry and Mango) Get a shot in it for $1 more and it helps you drink it faster :) No cover also which is sweeet. Dance floor is usually pretty empty for some reason. More of a chill bar I guess."}
{"text":"I recently had afternoon snacks and drinks at Fat Tuesday. Our server \"Alex\" is one of the most awesome servers I've ever had. Her enthusiasm and welcoming attitude made the experience that much more pleasant. Her recommendations were right on point. If you ever go, ask for Alex. We are looking forward to our next visit for the great food, drinks, and service! Thanks Alex, you're the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Skip buying drinks anywhere else on the strip, they are all a rip off. Go into this spot and sample until you find your flavor and level of alcohol. The prices are the best on the strip for what you get."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks! One drink, Max 2 drinks and you are done for the night! They sell huge mason jars called \"groupies\" for big groups and again super cheap! 

Great music!

I am curious on the food, but never make it early enough to try it and also feel weird being the only one eating @10, when everyone else is partying it up. LOL"}
{"text":"For someone who does not drink a lot, i fairly enjoyed my drink

I got the $18 48 inch one i believe (pina colada flavored with rum) and it was not too strong at all. I was actually able to drink it and got a tiny bit buzzed.

I like how you get a discount when you bring your bottle back ( mine was $18 and $14 refill if you reuse the bottle)

Tip:

if you really want to get a fat tuesday while in LV (it's a tradition in LV) do your research and find the nearest location near youre hotel etc. my group did the mistake of trying to find the FT off of people's pictures/recommendations when apparently, there was a FT right across from my hotel. Oh wells! Fat Tuesdays are everywhere fyi so be on the look out!"}
{"text":"I personally like the Strawberry Flavor but the Octane is the strongest! 

My Recommendation, Go to Fat Tuesday (At ANY location) hope its hot outside and let the Liquor hit your system... lol You'll be drunk in 10 mins.. 

Keep the refill cup and use the $1 off coupon for your trip"}
{"text":"Our friends took us here so that we can have a few drinks. This place seemed pretty poppin. They have an outside area and a separate bar. The drinks were made pretty strong and they have servers that constantly upsell jello shots as if they were making commission for it. The place was somewhat clean but at least it didn't smell. The staff seemed nice. Overall it was nice."}
{"text":"This is my go to bar.  Always bringing lots of friends,  and always having fun. Everyone is really awesome and friendly. 
The drinks are the best. I mean come on slushie alcohol! !!!!!! You gotta try it out! !!"}
{"text":"Just returned from the Phoenix area and so my friend insisted we check this place out.  Well basically the place serves an alcoholic versions of \"Slurpees\" in a variety of flavors.  If you've been to Las Vegas it's the same as those slushy alcoholic drinks but made in a small Arizona-sized portions.

I was ok hanging out on the patio but I don't think I would trek here as my destination.  The prices were ok as well as the scene.  In fact we saw a table of 8 people apparently just walk out without paying their bill so we watched half of the staff burst out the door running in different directions trying to apprehend the suspects.  Weird huh?"}
{"text":"Woah woah woah... hold up. Something doesn't feel right here. I'm not in Vegas. I'm not on Bourbon Street. I'm in mother effin' TEMPE?! Fat Tuesday!? Say what??

No wonder ASU is considered one of the largest party schools in the nation (fork 'em kids). On this street of restaurants and bars, you have one of the most notorious daiquiri serving spots in the world.

Sitting at the bar, we saw a lot of college kids frequenting this place, asking for mason jars full of booze and snacks to boot. I was not used to the idea of getting a Fat Tuesday and not traveling around with it like I usually would. However, they'e got some great Happy Hour deals here that make it worthwhile. $5 selected appetizers, $5.75 large (or medium) Fat Tuesdays, and $3.50 beers. Uh oh, trouble is coming.

Naturally had to order a large Strawberry/Mango mix. I would have gone for the 190 Octane, but feared I'd be needing to use the restroom a lot on my upcoming flight. We doused the alcohol with orders of the buffalo chicken dip and Fat's Original Fries, which were insanely, poutine delicious.

Good bar food, drinks, and an affordable price makes this one hard to pass up on Mill Ave. Be safe and drink responsibly kids."}
{"text":"Pierce was our server and boy was she sweet.  Greeted us with a smile was very attentive to our needs.  I can really tell she loves her job.   Oh and by the way great RACK too.   

Thanks fat Tuesday's I love this place always a great time come here every year for spring-training"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever received in a long time. It took about 40 minutes for an appetizer and another 30 for a wrap with French fries. Don't waste your time. Absolutely no point. After they apologized for the wait, it only took more time to get our meals."}
{"text":"Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.....

That's how I feel when I come here and get the 151.


Then, I get brain freeze and that's not so funny."}
{"text":"My first Fat Tuesday ever on my bachelorette party and it was YUMMY!! 

Delish mix of mango and bellini with a shot was a good buzz to get me through curling my hair and getting ready for Tryst that night! Ha!

Next time I want to get the $17 one that goes around your neck, with 190 Octane and everclear! Hahahah

Thanks Kyra R. for the good times!"}
{"text":"FAT TUESDAY x LAS VEGAS ! What's better than adult slushies?! I got the margarita with an extra shot of Jose for $13, which also came with the travel mug. A must try-- also a big plus : drinking outdoors is legal in Vegas! Fast and very friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm sure this review isn't entirely necessary but whatevs. Get a huge drank and add a few extra shots of 151 for $2 each and you're golden. I especially like this location for its proximity to the fish tank and Atlantis show. Pretty amusing.

Favorite flavors: peach bellini & strawberry. Not-so-favorite: cat 5. 190 Octane's alrighhht."}
{"text":"First off I was super surprised to find a Fat Tuesday that actually serves food! Maybe it's my Las Vegas ways but I never realized this was a thing. I originally came here after looking for a Saturday happy hour. They have daiquiris for only $5.75 and food specials too from 4-7.

My friend and I shared the buffalo chicken dip which tasted great but the chip to dip ratio was definitely off. We were left over with about ten chips and no dip, sad day.

The drinks were really what made up for it though. Majority of the flavors are mixed with everclear vodka which is no joke. I went with the grape one which was decently good and gave me a nice little buzz.

Overall this is a great place for snacks and pregaming. Can't go wrong with good, cheap food and drinks."}
{"text":"Pricey drinks. My niece had the big souvenir cup filled $21. Refills were $12-$14. Good frozen drinks. Free samples if you ask. Full bar. Right next to fall of Atlantis Caesars palace. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here during the day to meet up with my siblings for a bite. Came in the floor was sticky, sat down and the table was dirty and had to wait for them to clean one even though it was dead. We started to order for all of us before everyone was gonna show then the waitress, who clearly had bad hygiene look as if she literally rolled out of bed and put her hair into a bun which was falling apart, asked for our ID's...I'm over 21 but my sister is 20 and said with an attitude \"You're not even allowed in here\" when literally there was kids at the next table. Before coming into the restaurant we tried to look for a sign if it was 21 and older situation but did not see one sign...and the waitress says \"yeah, you have to be 21 to eat in here, we just don't want the board on us for having under age people in here\" well then place a sign outside saying you only want 21 and over. Yes I understand its a bar/grill but most of the places I've been have no problem. Besides that the kitchen area looked dirty...something like Jon Taffer would have a field day."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food great service!!! The people here are super nice!!! Has the roast beef sandwich and husband had the Cuban , love the food!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Bellini with an extra shot of hard vodka. The prices were kick ass and the service were cool. The place is kinda small but its whatever! This place serves interesting alcohol and mixed drinks that give excitement. The place itself makes you want to buy a drink lol! I'd def want to come back!"}
{"text":"Fat T, you gave me a $7 buzz at my arrival before noon. You are the breakfast of champions."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night, unbeknownst to me that it was happy hour. The happy hour specials are really good and the DJ was playing old mid-late 2000s hip hop. It was a good night!"}
{"text":"Vegas isn't complete without visiting one of these. They're pretty much everywhere, tastes consistently good, has consistently good service, and seriously, the price is good and it just hits the spot on a hot day.

Just think of it as an adult slushie, but don't feed any to your kids. I wish we had one close to where I live... but I'm grateful we don't otherwise I would get fat.

Careful though. These things creep up on you like no other."}
{"text":"Service and bomb pop slushi were great! Also tried a cherry soaked in Everclear, just like undergrad lol!"}
{"text":"We tried the Orbit bus to the center of Tempe and walked Mill looking for a place to eat lunch.  Fat Tuesday was where we decided to order.  The center of Tempe is definitely geared to the college crowd since ASU is right there.  

We chose to sit outside in the back.  The music wasn't quite so overbearing back there and at least we could talk. I'm thinking if we had stayed inside it would have been way too loud to even hear ourselves.

The server was amazing and even the best part of eating here.  Not to say what we ordered wasn't good.  It was but the server really shown.

We were all extremely pleased with our meals from the quesadillas to the pitas and to the chicken wings.  The food was delicious.  We would all return if in the area again."}
{"text":"This place could be a problem if it came to NYC. Alcoholic slushes, would lead to many problems on a hot summer day, but the bright side is that it is in Tempe - so I can enjoy it when I head out there.

I originally wanted to try a Fat Tuesday out in Vegas, but due to my hectic schedule out there, I never got a chance, but I had the opportunity to try the one in Tempe.

Concept-wise it is a cool idea, slushies with alcohol, so you can keep cool and get wasted at around $7 a pop. Other than that the place lacks. When I went it was pretty empty besides a few seedy people, and a magician showing off his talents. There is a patio so you can people-watch as you sip your frozen alco-slush, which might give you a slight buzz depending on what you got.

After you finish your slushie, you  probably have the idea of moving on and just walking around Mill Avenue because there is nothing really worth it here - that's if you call alcoholic slushies worth it. There are better bars in the area, with more of an atmosphere and less of a gimmick."}
{"text":"Average bar in Mill.  For it's theme, they do make a strong and sugar filled drink, so, I guess that's good if that's your thing.  Crowds, loud music are a norm on a weekend.  So, it's nothing special, true to it's theme, and good at what it's trying to do I guess, if your into that..."}
{"text":"I was refused to be let inside because I have my \"initials tattooed on my neck\" yes 2 bartenders, 3 bounces, and countless People i saw from standing inline had a form of a neck line tattoo...

But I think I just did. :) its nearly 2017. Catch up."}
{"text":"A yard drink....or half yard...or Pilsner (if you're trying to watch your alchie/sugar intake) is a MUST get in Vegas.  Adult Slurpees for sure.  It's a win win, it cools you off and gets you buzzed.  I got the Mango Pilsner for $11 and my friend treated me to a Cosmo Mother Pucker shot served in a test tube ($2 each).  

Bf got his 190 Octane, which is made of Everclear, at the MGM location which gave him a very good buzz.  I had a few sips of it, I could taste the alchie in it more than in my drink but it still tasted fruity.  I knew I couldn't handle all that Everclear, because unfortunately I'm a lightweight.  But I love their assorted flavors & variety of cup sizes I can get.  

Fat Tuesday is a Vegas staple and probably the best place that you can get your yard drink at."}
{"text":"Went to Fat Tuesday during the week for a late lunch. It was not crowded at all. The bartender was extremely nice and was a great waitress. We ordered a daiquiri and it was divine. I ordered the fajita wrap and it was so dang good. The wrap was full of delicious flavor. It was juicy and perfect seasoning. The bartender was nice to us and told us all about Tempe and local cities and where to move to. She even gave us a free cherry as a welcoming to Arizona. Would definitely recommend the wrap and fries, but also the drinks and great service."}
{"text":"Two words: PANTY DROPPER.

Definitely made me want to make my panties drop. HAHA I'm kidding, but really ask for that mix. I believe it's a mixture of peach belini and 198 octane. 

I was a Vegas noob, therefore I was a Fat Tuesday noob. I tried many flavors but they all seemed a bit too strong for my taste, so I debated whether or not I wanted to get one. 

In any case, my friend as the bar tender what his favorite mix was, and he said \"Panty dropper, let me get it for you.\" He handed her the mix and her eyes lit up in excitement, so of course seeing that, I had to try it for myself! First sip, and BOOM, you got me. 

I ordered a half yard of the Panty Dropper and it was so delicious I just kept drinking it...I lightweight wished I ordered the full yard because it was so good! $14 for the half yard and $11 or $12 for refills? I think yes! 

This location seemed less busy than the one in Planet Hollywood, but I could be wrong. 

If you want to really feel it, ask for an extra shot of Peach Schnapps, uhm AMAZING and will definitely keep you buzzing for the entirety of your drink. hehehe"}
{"text":"FAT TUESDAYS AT WESTGATE IS SOOOOOOO AWESOME!!! MICKEY WAS THE GREATEST!! and Bobby and Johnnie were very nice. I'm so happy it's finally opened here on the west side of town. Because of how great MICKEY was we all will be back again and again."}
{"text":"If you're going to get a booze slurpee get them here.  The drinks are not watered down like that rock & roll joint on the boulevard at the Imperial place.  Although i still recommend getting an extra shot or 2 especially if you're going to get the full yard size (48oz)
  Pina Colada - Good
  Margarita - to sour
  190 Octane - good, orangy."}
{"text":"Do not go to this establishment. I witnessed the bouncers physically assault a young man and woman and then lie to the police about it. I have it recorded. I also have several witnesses that saw it happen.  I will never go back..the staffs behavior was irresponsible."}
{"text":"I went out to smoke a cigarette and they kicked me out.  I went around and told them that my friend is still there.  They kick my friend out with no reason!   I just ask to let my friend know that I was out side but they kicked him out with no reason.  He wasn't even able to finish his drink that he bought before getting kicking out!!!   That not good. It's bad.  It's not right to kick someone out because of someone else"}
{"text":"Apparently I stand corrected and this place is still open. Maybe they were just spraying for crabs when I walked by... It was boarded up.. But now a fully functioning bump and grind. Enjoy."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been at such a packed bar with such amazing service. The crowd is insane and people are coming up to the bar non stop but the bar staff is absolutely amazing. Not only are they extremely attentive but they are genuinely friendly and make you want to come back again. So pleased with today's service. Thank you fit being on your A game even with a big match up like ASU and Notre Dame on every screen.  =)"}
{"text":"Ok so the food is good and the drinks awesome and the customer service is great, the customer service is what got me to write a review here.

I accidentally left my debit card at Fat Tuesday last Wednesday and flew out on Thursday for a trip.  They located my card on Thursday but I had already left.  Mark, one of the managers, insisted that I let him pay to overnight the card to me at my hotel, which he did.  

The card was the only means of payment I had on the trip, so needless to say this was a life saver.   THAT is something you never see anymore because THAT is real customer service.

Thank you so much for being a GOOD business!"}
{"text":"My favorite Fat Tuesday! The only one I know of that still serves mudslides (the best!) 

It's in the back of the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. At this one, there are actual tables to sit at, and you can watch the show every hour in the middle of the mall (still have no idea what it's about, but I saw fires and sorcery and stuff). You can also get snacks here, at the Chippery, for a salty/sweet treat with your drink.

The only downsides to this location are that shots are $2 each instead of one, and they only carry double-size jello shots for double the price as well. It's also wayyyyyyy in the back of the mall and quite a journey to get there.

You're not really in Vegas unless you're holding a 32oz. yard with extra shots. Come here first!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places on Mill that always seems really popular, so every now and again you feel the need to go inside and see what all the noise is about, but you are left disappointed every time.

Let me just shoot off the bad so we can get that out of the way: always a long line outside for no reason, incredibly sugary frozen alcoholic beverages are gross, and a $10 minimum on credit card transactions (so lame).

They do have a decent deal on Fireball shots (like 3 bucks per shot on some nights) and they have Yelp check-in offers, but you cannot combine the two (understandable but you would think that this place has some type of saving grace). Music is usually decent but about every third song is just a terrible remix of an overplayed radio Top 40 song.

I'd suggest some of the more unique options nearby like Robbie Fox's or Cue Club."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are moving to a new place and during the requisite \"cleaning out\" phase of things, we discovered that a least half of our glassware was furnished by Fat Tuesday.

I've have many fond (??) memories (???) of Fat Tuesday- this location, the MGM location, and the Planet Hollywood location.  The first time hubby and I went there, the result was a purchase of $1000 sunglasses that played MP3s (when I came out of what I like to call the \"trance\", they were returned). The second time resulted in an effing fabulous day with an even more effing fabulous hangover.  The most recent trip resulted in one of the best nights of my life.

Things to try:
190 Octane and the Hurricane. The jello shots are also good. 

Do not try:
The fruit soaked in booze- even the guy serving us said it sucked.

Also- keep your cup because you get a discount on refills- and then you don't have to buy glasses for your apartment."}
{"text":"What's better than having an ice cold slushie in 110 degree weather? umm, an ice cold slushie with alcohol and a shot of Everclear!

We tried the 190 Octane (Orangey flavored/Everclear), Cat 5 Hurricane (Fruit Punch/151 shot), and Strawberry Daiquiri layered with Pina Colada (Mine! SO GOOD!)

Extra shots are now $2 each and come in an inverted test tube. Don't let curious people around your drink -- they might pull out the test tube and dump the entire shot into your glass.. like I did. HAHA..

One half yard (32oz for $12) plus the extra shot will definitely, DEFINITELY get you nicely buzzed.. and have you wandering the streets of Vegas walking home from Caesar's Palace.. stopping by for some pizza at a random joint.. and so on and so forth. :P

make sure to bring back your souvenir glass for discounted refills! aka round 2 :)"}
{"text":"This gets 2 stars due to it being in Ceasar's :) Ok so this is another cut and paste why? Because it's Bash Fat Tuesday Day...Nah....they're not that bad..Mwahahaha ok ok it's kinda funny..You really gotta see them work.
\"Today is Bash Fat Tuesday day....That means I get to copy my fat tuesday review and paste it on another one! Yes...I am the Fat Tuesday Slurpee bandit. Really....Get a margarita machine....Or better yet. Go to the Sev....and bring your own liquor and pour in about two oz of liquor per 16 oz of slurpee....Yes...rinse and repeat. There. That is your training class for Fat Tuesdays. You are now certified as a FAT TUESDAY BARTENDER. Thank you come again.

OK --- Fat Tuesday = Not a bar.
It's where 7-11 employees graduate to. Seriously a monkey can pour an adult slurpee. This place is for amateurs.
When you first turn 21...This is a good place. 
\"yea I want some red....and purple....and blue.....and mix it with a little white. Oh and put a shot of malibu...\"
\"Yea and can I get one for my girlfriend too? She wants purple....with green...and red....and white. No shot of malibu. It's too strong\"
Baby steps....baby steps.....\""}
{"text":"Oh, Fat Tuesday's. How you confuse me. I'm unsure about my emotions regarding this venue. It errs on the borderline \"strongly dislike\" side, yet I can't tear myself away from Monday nights. To be frank, Mondays are the only nights that are halfway decent. Granted, I rarely go, and when I do, it's with a group of my closest friends. But cheap drinks. How can you go wrong? When you're bored, and have nothing better to do, take a group of your closest friends and grab cheap drinks. The atmosphere of the club is interesting. There are a lot of creepy, shady characters that frequent the place, save the few college kids that stand out like a moth on flypaper. The drinks...meh. They are alright.  You won't attain any orgasms by drinking the slushies, so I'd save my dollar bills for some shots of tequila, if you're able to handle that. All in all, I'd say that Fat Tuesday's is a place you would go to when you're extremely bored, and are broke. Don't expect ridiculously thin legged models, and a bunch of young, beerpong loving college coeds - or atleast on Monday's. Just go for the sake of your hurting wallet."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE place to get a slushy drink. Fat Tuesday is inexpensive and always perfect. Always go for the extra $1 shot. Hell, sometimes I get 2. 

I especially like this Fat Tuesday because they have table seating outside, unlike the one at the MGM. And if you're there long enough you can enjoy the Atlantis Show that comes on every hour. 

My personal favorite is the Pina Colada swirled with the Strawberry Daiquiri. Delish! 

I come EVERY TIME when I'm in Vegas and I will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Came here after a long day at work. Close to ASU so the crowd will be a bit younger.

For a Wednesday night, this place had a DJ going on. Not sure of the whole DJ-ing combined with music videos. So I'm not fully sold the DJ was mixing music or just firing up YouTube videos to show on the screens. Otherwise, the music was great.

They had late night happy hour. But I came in for a drink. The only Fat Tuesday locations I've been to are the ones in Vegas. This one, you can sit down and grab food and a nice adult slushie beverage or whatever beer or liquor you may want as it is a full bar.

Lots of space. They closed the patio area down since it was a weekday. I'm sure it can get rowdy during the weekends and whatnot."}
{"text":"I will never ever, ever, ever, ever go here again. Last night I was there for Fat Tuesday celebrations. Was there for a good 4 hours, walked a few feet from the back entrance to take a phone call and when I tried coming back in they tried to charge me another cover charge. The security guy acknowledged that he seen me walk away and insisted that he could not let me in without another fee. When I asked who his boss was he refused to give that info. I had already spent a good $80 on myself there and didn't think it was right to charge me to reenter the event I had already been at and spending good money on. This experience was so bad that I will not spend another penny at this establishment. I now absolutely hate this place!!!"}
{"text":"I think the only Fat Tuesdays in Arizona one of the best original bars on mill ave. I love the friendly service and how the waiters/waitress kept checking up on us. Tuesdays is happy hour all day so if ya need that quick pick me up or feeling like you need a drink days, it's a must go and check it out. Large daiquiris are 5.50 so might as well right? Only on Tuesdays tho! I had the loaded fries and shared it with a friend pretty legit! And enough for a lot 2 maybe 3. Overall a place to check out if your looking for a fun time if you know what I mean!"}
{"text":"One star off for closing at 11pm on Sundays. 

I love fat tuesdays!!!! Got the half yard margarita with 3 extra shots for a total of 15 dollars. The nice bartender gave us coupons for the refills. But we didn't end up getting a refill because when we went back on sunday, it was closed, and it was only 11pm!!! Margarita is my favorite and since I hate rum and super sweet drinks, this was pretty much the clear choice for me. I couldn't even taste the 3 extra shots after mixing them in pretty well. But danggg, they hit me after I finished the half yard. 

It made walking around the las vegas strip so much more entertaining. And the hangover the next morning isnt' bad either."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night for the first time with some friends and fam. The music was good, the outdoor patio section in back is nice, the food was good and the frozen drink I tried (something with mango) was tasty and had just the right amount of alcohol. The servers were very attentive and kept coming by asking us if we needed anything. The decor on the inside could use an update or remodel and there is nothing special about the menu (except alligator nuggets). But... the frozen drink section!!! The best thing about this place! I've never seen so many frozen drink choices! I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"You drink slushies until you hit brain freeze #5 and you feel like dancing. It is not that difficult to understand! Banana is great, but you can't go wrong with the Octane 190. Hell, you can mix these if you want--they've got a menu detailing the fun combos

But if you make it a little earlier in the evening, you can certainly treat yourself to good bar food. I recommend the nachos. There's a cool little patio as well. The happy hour is groovy--with discounted apps and $6 daquiris. It is *well* worth it!

I can't wait to come back more often in warmer weather."}
{"text":"The second half of date night was spent on the new huge patio at Fat Tuesday's. I didn't come here enough in college. 

It is a nice change to normal beer or vodka drinks everywhere else. I have been there several time over the past few years and they have made a lot of changes since the last time we were there. The patio is nice and huge now with TVs and an outside bar. The drinks are always good, and they came up with a bunch of new concoctions. I had the Fruit Cocktail one, super good. It was a mix of the Pina Colada, Strawberry, Melon and Octane, it was like a new flavor in every sip. 

The staff is friendly and not too chatty, but just enough.

We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"kept hearing about this place so I had to try it. Basically a big alcohilic slurpee. U can add xtra shots if u want. I didnt get as drunk as I expected, but it tasted ok and it was cheap."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas, this is the first thing I go to. There are about 6-7 flavors you can choose from and you could also mix 2 flavors. I usually go for the Bellini and Pina Colada. But if I'm feeling like a champ, I get the 44 Magnum ( Octane and Cat 5) the 2 strongest flavors and add a extra shot :P 

Save your souvenir cup! You're going to want to come back and save a buck or two."}
{"text":"My favorite bar on Mill Ave... because it's friggen hot in Phoenix, and they have the best of 2 worlds mashed together... booze and slushies!! 

I go for Happy Hour usually because it always seems to be Happy Hour there. Their food is really good too... I usually just get the Chicken Strips appetizer though. 191 Octane and Banana daiquiri mix with a dollar shot on the side, and maybe one or four of their alcohol-soaked cherries. I know what I want!"}
{"text":"Very well organized to get you in and out. Ingenious way to keep you coming , they give you $1 off coupons and when you come to refill , they let you know they recycle and to keep the coupon and keep coming back. staff is very friendly , they pretty much serve any alcohol you want :)"}
{"text":"Good Price. Good Drinks! Only 12 bucks for half a yard of frozen good stuff! i got 190 Octane, Pina colada, and Bellini all mixed into one, which tasted great!  not too strong as a whole because the pina colada and bellini diluted and weakened the 190 Octane.  if wanted something stronger, just add a test-tube of Everclear for $2 extra.  anyway, it was fun and i liked Fat Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt it's our 1st stop always after arriving in Las Vegas!  Best location is in the Forum Shops @ Caesars... always outstanding both in product & superior friendly staff."}
{"text":"My first meal in Arizona in 22 years started here.  I used to live in the Mesa area while going to school back in the 90's.  We had an overnight layover after vacationing in Mexico and decided to stop in Phoenix instead of Dallas.  And when there is free time, it's all about the food!  As I searched the Tempe area on Yelp, Fat Tuesday popped up.  Looked at the menu and was sold as I love Southern food.  Plus, they're located on infamous Mill Avenue, an area I wanted to show my spouse.

ATMOSPHERE:
ID was required to enter at dinner time.  I thought they were a restaurant but they're more of a bar, so the absence of little ones was nice.  Inside lighting was dim, with a mix of bar seats, low and high tops.  Covered front patio seating looked onto Mill Ave. while rear patio seating sported backyard-style furniture and tables under colorful string lights.  Daiquiri machines lined the back of bar.  A live DJ spun and music pumped throughout the eatery.  The vibe is young and fun.

MENU:
Southern-influenced bar-style apps, pasta, sandwiches, wraps, salads, burgers, desserts, daiquiris, beer, wine, sangria.

BEVERAGE:
Creamsicle Daiquiri - $9.00 (large)
OMG, this was absolutely delish!  After ordering my boring white wine, my spouse said to take a sip of the daiquiri.  I immediately canceled the wine.  I guess they're known for their cornucopia of flavors, apparent from the lengthy menu.  The daiquiri was thick and icy, and tasted just like a creamsicle popsicle.  Being dubbed with their 190 Octane moniker, it also included a bit of Everclear, oh yeah.  Because we were having dinner elsewhere, I sadly only had one.

FOOD:
Alligator Nugs - $15.00
Yup, this was real alligator meat inside and it was really good.  The texture was just as the server described - a mix between chicken and fish.  The \"nugs\" were breaded, deep-fried and were insanely moist and tender.  We opted for Cajun fries which had a nice kick to them.  I preferred ranch dressing to their remoulade sauce for dipping.  Highly recommended!

Wings - $11.50 (10-pieces)
The Cajun dry rub had a spice level of 3 on a 5-scale.  While mostly savory, there was a bit of sweetness in the rub that I wish wasn't there, but, I finished all of it.  The wings were cooked perfectly crispy with fairly juicy insides.  A seriously great deal for normally pricey wings.  Ranch and blue cheese dressings were tasty accompaniments.

SERVICE:
The bouncer checking ID's was friendly.

It's seat yourself so we chose a table in the rear patio.  Lexi was our server and greeted us shortly after sitting.  I thought we wouldn't receive good service due to her young age but she was great.  She answered all of our questions, checked on us often and was very professional.

OVERALL:
What a great find!  Fun vibe, tasty daiquiris, good food."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday might just be my favorite thing in Vegas.  We first encountered this location which is at the end of the Forum Shops in Caesars Palace surrounding the Atlantis show fountain.  It was 10:30 in the morning but day drinking is more than acceptable here.  There are about 85 different drink sizes here to ponder (mild exaggeration) and I felt like a kid in a candy store with wide eyes and my head tilted back taking in everything.  We settled on one of the normal looking tumblers (but not the smallest size) which if you bring it back, you get a cheaper refill.  And you will bring it back!  We sampled a few flavors and I got margarita, the bf got 190 octane.  We were tipsy by the time the Atlantis fountain started, which was probably a good thing.  This Fat Tuesday's has a little seating area if you need to take a load off to enjoy your adult beverage.  They also have test tube shots, jello shots and who knows what else!"}
{"text":"Located in the middle of the miracle mile shops in which you can easily get lost, stands the Fat Tuesday posted in front of another restaurant. 

Great price for an alcoholic slushy, but I forgot how much it was, I think it was $14 for mine cause I had the bottle and just wanted a refill, also had that $1 off coupon. Feel free to mix the flavors and always ask for the extra shot =). One of these fuckers will definitely give you a brain freeze while impairing judgment lol. 
Also make sure to mix the drink if you get that extra shot or else at the end you are gonna get pounded with alcohol ice. 

Lines at this place move fast, and the bartender/cashier is quick."}
{"text":"Before I moved to Vegas this place is really one of the strongest cliche Vegas things to make sure to take advantage of.. Nothing says Vegas to me more while on the strip than a alcohol infused slushie in a Yard.  It is also a great prefunk treat if you are planning on just wandering the strip aimlessly . There are 6 locations on the strip and someday I plan on hitting all 6 in one day...possibly UYE hmmm...."}
{"text":"Head to the very back to get yourself some delicious fresh potato chips!  They're about $3.99 for a small bag, but it's a pretty huge portion for two to share.  They had quite a few flavors.  We tried the Ketchup and the Salt & Vinegar.

Next time, I'm going to chase my potato chips with a 190 Octane, now that's a snack!"}
{"text":"Review #500!! Viva Las Vegas!!

This location is hidden away waaaay in the back of the Forum Shops, next to the Fall of Atlantis statues and aquarium (get buzzed and stay for the show -- it's a blast).

We'd hit a couple of other FT locations already, but this one took, by far, the longest to get to since it was all the way at the back of the shopping area. However, it does have the best view of the other locations (on The Strip next to The Venetian and inside Planet Hollywood).

Plenty of seating and has the same flavors as the other locations. The only added plus is the view!"}
{"text":"I have hence tried this place again. And lonand behold, the girly foo foo drinks are still exactly that. But however notice the fourth star to my previous three star review. Jason, props to you for being an outstanding server; we were recommended the fried okra. Yaaz! The sauce was pretentious but I enjoyed greatly the batter on the target tot sized okra pieces. Not what i would have expected from a Mill bar. Kudos to you sir."}
{"text":"I have had 1 horrible experience due to one employee, however after writing a bad review and rating this place 1 star, the owner, Chad himself messaged me personally to try to understand what happened to try to fix the issue. So, I am now rating this place a 5 star because of all my previous experiences that I had and especially because of Chad. There are a lot of owners who would not go out of their way to personally understand what happened in order to fix it. Chad def made up for my one bad experience. It is because of owners like Chad that make a great and successful business."}
{"text":"The Bellini is always a classic! It's all I ever get. Have yet to try the food but it looked good from what I saw! Will def be back to Tempe to try it out without the kiddos!"}
{"text":"Went here on vacation with some friends. The place was packed. 
There was no cover. Very good bartenders. The bartenders are super quick with drinks, even though the place had tons of people. The music was not really my thing, but I still had a great time. The music is very loud, but they have a great outside area."}
{"text":"Do ppl come here to have fun? Or just have a stupor?  There is a very fine line between these two, case in point, two friends sitting in the bar drinking the whatever the hip drinks they ordered, chatting and enjoying at each other's jokes, then all of a sudden,  one burst into this long uncontrollable laughter, peppered with slurred incoherent speech, with that lotto winner elation in her gaze, O_O , second later she started humming a melancholy 80's tune.  I know at this point, my dear friend had crossed the thin line between sanity and dangerous cloud nine.   It's time for the responsible one (me) to take her friend back to the adobo for safe keeping.

Yet we hit the spot again and again just so we can have our visions blurred until everything became a moving feast.  It doesn't take much to get that girl hammered.  ;D"}
{"text":"Went to have lunch. It was delicious and the slushie mixed drinks are amazing!! Check it out great environment to have a few drinks with friends!!!"}
{"text":"I frequent Fat Tuesdays for every Vegas get away. This one in particular is my favorite of all the locations. Staff is friendly and drinks are great. plus the cups are awesome and a great souvenir. Always stop here first, usual makes for an interesting Vegas night :) Please dont forget ID because they never forget to card!"}
{"text":"In a word, daiquiris. That's what they are known for. They do have a small dance area, which is rarely used on the weekend nights, because everyone is getting daiquiris. All of them are really powerful.  
Nice spot on Mill Ave, in Tempe."}
{"text":"There's something magical about drinking an alcoholic frozen beverage in a football-shaped cup.  Or maybe it was that 190 Octane that had me thinking magical thoughts.  Everclear, orange syrup, and something else in the 190 Octane is a lethal combination.

That is all."}
{"text":"The bartenders make sub standard drinks and won't remake them if youre unhappy with your drink. Bull."}
{"text":"This place was sooo fun! All of their drinks that I had I absolutely loved! My friends and I got a groupie drink and some daiquiris and I was pleasantly surprised by the pretty reasonable prices. There happy hour is fantastic as well  and it's definitely a good place for good music, dancing and drinks!"}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Fat Tuesdays.  Went on a Sunday.  Nothing better than an ice cold drink sitting out on the patio in a college town, plenty to see.  Tasty drinks.  Had a DJ playing tunes.  Good way to waste an afternoon."}
{"text":"Everyone kept telling me I had to try this place...so I finally got around to it. an adult's 7-11. 

$11 for a huge cup.....i think it's like a foot? I asked for the 190 octane, yes, gotta have my 190 grain alcohols, mixed with strawberry. apparently, that's called a spring fling. haha. cute. there was this other mix, it was the amaretto pineapple with.....i think the hurricane? i forget, you can ask them...but it tasted exactly like those BIG STICK popsicles. i would've gotten it, but i wanted my 190 octane because i'm not exactly a light weight =( 

i didn't know you could add a shot of everclear. damn. i'm so doing that next time. i added a shot of rum for $1 and being a scientist and all, i was highly amused..that's the best damn thing i've seen in a test tube thus far. 

i wasn't even buzzed once i finished =( but a delicious, alcoholic slushie that costs as much as one drink at a bar, but is 3 times the size? i'm not complaining. i'll be back next time. and i'm getting my shot of everclear!"}
{"text":"my friend's first time in vegas, and he heard a lot about this place. all i know is that we walked a mighty long way in 100+ degree weather to find it. 

no we did not stop for imitations - but boy did that eiffel tower slushie look good. 

anyhow, we found it in what looked like a mall shop [in caesar's palace]. my bud got the 190 Octane [supposedly highest alcohol content] and i settled for the Cat 5 Hurricane, because it had my old friend, mr. 151. surprisingly good. needless to say, we didnt have breakfast yet, and after about 1/8 of the way in, i was feeling mighty good. so good, that i had to redeem that $100 red mistake i made at Casino Royale. 

$300 on red, and red came through. good weekend after all.

oh yeah, you can keep the souvenir cup and come back for cheaper refills, and possibly save a buck or two. unless you plan on stopping by multiple Fat Tuesdays, but i think it's hardly worth the trouble and hassle of carrying a clunker around."}
{"text":"Things that weren't great -
I agree with Jenny H. on security being on a power trip. Lol. Not busy, with mom and husband and acting like he's above us. Weirdest sh*t. 
Also wouldn't let us bring a water bottle in... okay.
Ordered nachos they were missing the guacamole. 
Bartender only checked up every half hour.
They stopped serving food at 1030. It would have been nice if we were informed. Kind of like a \"last call\", if you will.

Things that were better -
Regardless, the bartender was nice. She gave me a sample of a drink I was questioning. She refilled my mom's water each time she stopped by. She got a little crazy and started dancing towards closing. Lol. But it was funny. 
Also, nachos were good even with the missing topping.
All of the drinks were good and/or strong."}
{"text":"First time here on a scorching hot afternoon. Was craving something to crunch our thirst and found Fat Tuesday. We decided to get the largest size and we got the yard size for $18 in cash. Cash only btw. We had a mix of pina colada and strawberrry daiquiri. Delish and crunch ur thirst! Yum. Gotta give it a try!

The line is not long either on a Friday afternoon too."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday is by far the best deal out of all the alcoholic slurpee spots in Las Vegas. 

The first time I tried it was a hot summer day in July. I was exhausted from walking the strip, and tried to dodge into any air conditioned hotel that I could find. But at the same time, I was in Vegas, I wanted to party. 

What caught my eye about Fat Tuesday was the colorful swirls going on in the yardsticks. I ordered a mango daiquiri in the yardstick for just $18. Super good deal! And I got an extra vodka shot for just $1. 

The staff was super friendly. I give them credit for dealing with drunk people all day who are clamoring to get a drink, but they managed to keep their cool and serve everyone. 

In my opinion, taking a picture with a yardstick in Las Vegas is pretty much mandatory. And if you're going to do it, Fat Tuesdays is the best deal in town."}
{"text":"The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Fat Tuesday is \"dark\" and \"dirty\", each vying for the position of first. 

This is the kind of place where underage ASU kids sneak in and a frat boy roofies a girl's drink and catches her alone in the dark, grimy, secluded bathroom area. I'm serious. It's that bad.

This is not comparable to the daiquiri/margarita slush deals in Vegas either.

The overjuiced Pauly D look-a-like bartender would not leave us alone, and kept regaling us with tales of why girlfriends and boyfriends are a waste of time and you should just kick em to the curb in the morning.... Thanks for the advice, broseph, I'll be sure to tell my boyfriend that.

And speaking of the hangovers: You know how I knew I was going to get a hangover? Not because of the alcohol in my drink, but because of the sugar. It was like they dumped 10 lbs of sugar in each machine. And guess when I got that hangover? Not 20 minutes after finishing my drink. Talk about feeling like crap, ingest 300 grams of sugar along with probably 3 shots of rum blended with ice. BLECK."}
{"text":"Wow, just got told I can't enter as I have on basketball shorts... At a casual bar near ASU... REALLY!!!"}
{"text":"One drunken night this past weekend we stumbled into Fat Tuesday and had quite a variety of mixed cocktails (all of which helped me crave a spicy sausage from down the street). 

The music was pretty decent and typical, I can't imagine someone complaining about the music being \"too loud\" for an establishment such as this. The girls were shameless and there were hot guys as far as the eye could see (note: there were also creepy old dudes hanging around just waiting for the right drunken bimbo to fall into their arms asking if they were her daddy). I should mention that the guy to girl ratio was something like 5:1, but I wasn't really complaining. 

My only complaint about this place - being that I don't typically wear anything other than my rainbows - is that I was incapable of easily moving my feet, I had to use quite a bit of force to lift them off of the ground, walk, or even move. The floor was so sticky, I can't imagine that they EVER actually clean that floor with anything other than a hose. The morning after I even found bits and pieces of the floor from Fat Tuesday stuck to soles of my sandals. 

Other than that, this place was pretty cool - if you're a guy looking to get a girl drunk (fast) I'd suggest taking her here, especially since they offer such a high variety of slushy, fruity, and heavy-on-the-alcohol drinks."}
{"text":"We only had drinks I didn't do anything in the chippery.  We sat and watched the zeus show.the drink was excellent."}
{"text":"So they have updated the patio seating which is nice! I'll miss the multicolor though"}
{"text":"Why can't all Fat Tuesdays be like this location?! 

Every time I go to Vegas, I HAVE to go to Fat Tuesday... multiple times. As I was driving down the street I got overly excited when I saw Fat Tuesday but thought the name was a coincidence and not a branch of my beloved drinks. 

There's outdoor seating, private rooms, a dance floor, DJ, bar and food with a happy hour.... WHAT IS THERE NOT TO LOVE ABOUT THIS PLACE?!?! Went in on a Wednesday night after the Suns game and it was pretty empty- but the DJ was still spinning the new hits. 

If you're not sure what flavor slushee you want to try- the bartender will let you sample. 

Pass on the cajun wings- the flavor is a rub and is pretty dry in my opinion. Also, it comes with a pathetic piece of celery and carrot. Sigh."}
{"text":"I don't care for many Mill Avenue establishments during the school year. Drunken frat boys playing alpha male and sorority girls doing their slutty exhibitionist thing just hit a sour note. However in the off hours of college binge drinking, say Saturday day drinking or summer and winter break, I really enjoy me some Mill Avenue. One of my favorite places on the strip is Fat Tuesdays.

You see, I have a weakness. And that weakness is slushy drinks. Slush puppies, Mr. Mistys, Icees, and the mother of them all...the pina colada. Which in a nutshell is why I like Fat Tuesdays. It's pure sugar and ice blended into a melange of delicious. Granted, all the red frozen drinks taste the exact same, but the 190 Octane, Pina Colada thing, Blue Raspberry and Mango are delicious flavors that end in big old hangovers if you overindulge. But since they're frozen, it takes much longer to sip one down than a regular mixed drink, saving you money and still messing you up (provided you go the 190 Octane route). 

Make sure to try an Atomic Cherry (or Nuclear Cherry or whatever they're called) for 50 cents while you're there. It's a downright painfully delicious experience. If you go with a group, which is recommended because you have to bring your own posse of fun up to Mill Avenue, splurge for a round of them. Then watch even the manliest macho man agree that those everclear soaked cherries are a painful bitch to confront.

But under all circumstances, don't get the food. It's sucktastic, and with so many other awesome options around Mill, why bother?"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Fat Tuesday's. Known for their frozen slushie-style drinks flavored and mixed with different types of alcohol depending on what you get. A lot of slushy-type places out there but this is one of the best. They will let you try whatever for free too. The bartenders usually will help with recommendations and you can even mix flavors if you want. They have discounted refills when you refill the approved cup (many different sizes and styles of cups).  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came in here got great service the first time. Then I came for a refill and the other guy was a jerk... I couldn't get their names but they should all be friendly and look happy to b at work if not dnt work."}
{"text":"Hunted down this place after seeing some awesome reviews here.

Tried out the 44 Magnum which was a combination of the 190 Octane and Cat 5 Hurricane. It was really good and got a nice buzz going! The Amaretto Pineapple was a bit bitter for my taste, though. The place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is your a-typical Mill Ave bar, deep in the heart of the portion of Mill overrun by ASU students on the weekends. I've been to another Fat Tuesday in Key West and it's the same vibe at both locations, just different demos. 

This Mill location though is crazy loud at night, sometimes to the point of insanity-let's-purposefully-lose-our-hearing-loud. It's unfortunate that it even bleeds into their small outdoor sitting area so you really can't have a conversation with anyone. 

The drinks... whoa they are strong! I love the frozen daiquiris especially with friends so we can all get different ones to share."}
{"text":"Not great service No sign that they don't take cards for under $5. Bartender not helpful"}
{"text":"If you want a server that is funny and someone that recommends great items for you. Then you have to go see Alex. She is the best, very personal and she has a great personality.  Keep up the great work Alex."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday for some pre-gaming before the ASU vs. Wisconsin game. We have been here a few times before but never on a Football Saturday. 

It was about half-full when we got there but by the time we got our drinks the bar was filling up pretty quickly. The bartenders looked a bit flustered with the crowd, but I would think they were making good tips since 90percent of the crowd were Wisconsin fans(vacation money, spend it all)

We had a $4 Hurricane which hit the spot, after that we had one of the frozen drinks, was perfect for the heat, can't remember which one, but whatever has the most booze in it.

They also offer the NFL Sunday ticket, but I only counted 8 TV's, so I can't imagine this place on a Sunday.

I'll be back, but probably not till Fat Tuesday."}
{"text":"The best ever im going every Friday the wings omg yessss the drinks are the best ever im in love I drive 38 mins to go there the best place I ever been"}
{"text":"So yet another westgate Business that once the ambience wears off will be filing for bankruptcy!! Only due to the idiotic security that chooses to card 53 and 58-year-old people!! Yes I'm sure there will be people that say card everyone but there is such a thing as common sense. I simply went next door and had a much better time so if you want to have a good time go to desert rose!! It's a blast and ALL of the staff is cool"}
{"text":"This place, like a good number of downtown Tempe establishments, is simply a bar with food as an afterthought. My friends and I sat outside and ordered burgers and drinks. The burgers were just average. Even though I ordered a green chile and guacamole burger with pepper jack cheese, it was still rather bland. 

Our waitress was very pleasant and helpful and her knowledge of the menu was evident in the recommendations she made. We enjoyed watching the foot and vehicle traffic passing by. Overall, ho hum."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, you MUST at least order a Fat Tuesday...
I cannot think of a better way to beat the heat in Vegas. From Pina Colado to Strawberry Daiquiri, they have an amazing variety of flavors to choose from. One of my favorites are the Hurricane & Bellini mixed together! For those who can't stand the taste of alcohol, it's perfect for you. But don't let it fool you, there's actually quite a fair amount of alcohol and it slowly creeps up on you! Also, extra shots for $1 more and they also have jello shots for $1! Such a great deal. Their sizes are perfect for sharing ranging from 20oz to 100oz if you want to go BIG.

There are many Fat Tuesday locations such as The Forum Shop, Mandalay Bay, Planet Hollywood, MGM, The Palazzo, and a few more I can't remember haha. Don't travel too far to get one!

Tip: Bring back your cup for a discounted price :) You'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"There are a lot of bars to chose from on Mill, but this one is easily my favorite.  This bar has it all.  Fantastic combination outdoor-indoor environment.  Great bartenders and staff.  The music and DJs are good, particularly Eli on Saturdays.  Overall, excellent vibe.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Go ham but only if you can handle. My boyfriend got the Magnum flavor in the big yard cup. This flavor was less fruity than the other ones. I personally liked it but if you prefer to sip on fruity drinks, then skip this flavor. Also, it looks safe and cute in a slushy form but don't go sippin on the whole cup at once. 

Minus one star for the guy that helped us. He was rushing through us to get to the next one so we didn't get to take our time and pick out what we liked. My boyfriend also paid 20 dollars for it. But you can keep the cup for cheaper refills. 

I'd say try this at least once when you're in Vegas. When you're holding the yard cup down The Strip, a lot of people might give you questionable glances. And if you're like my boyfriend, you might seem silly holding the giant cup around. But try it once!"}
{"text":"This is my first stop when going to Mill ave on the weekend. The drinks are really strong (MOST of the time), so start with a slushie and by the time you leave for the next bar you'll be feeling pretty good. The music here is...okay to good. Sometimes I come in and it's one hype song after another and then some random techno mixed with another song will come on and it gets pretty dead after that. I don't think I've ever been here when it was extremely packed but it is great for a night starter. The guys are kind of creepy and lurk a lot. This is also the place usually where preppy people flock here to wistfully watch a couple of girls grind on each other, which would be cool if there wasn't someones dad also mixed in there trying to get in on some of the action...anyways, I digress.
tl;dr: Come here for a slushie or two, dance for a bit, and then move on to Zuma"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight because we were interested to see what Alligator nuggets tasted like. I have to say they weren't half bad the deep fried okra was just ok and the sizzling peppers where bland and not even worth mentioning.
Brought up the yelp coupon at the end of our meal for 1/2 off of a drink and the owner wouldn't honor it because it was happy hour although the coupon didn't mention you couldn't use it during happy hour. Their were children sitting at the bar where the adults were sitting and drinking and which to be quite honest I didn't even think was allowed in most states and our waitress was clueless. All in all I'd give this place a thumbs down with no chance of a repeat visit. Once was definitely enough for this city girl...."}
{"text":"Great customer service. My card was charged for a tab I ended up paying with cash. I called the next day to figure out how to fix the problem. The manager Chad was so polite on the phone I gave my info and he told me when I came this weekend I would get my money back. I was happy it was so easy! I went and got my money but I was shocked when i opened up the envelope to see there along with my money there was a gift certificate! It really made my night! So generous! So helpful! Thank you! I'll be back for sure! And a special thanks to Chad!"}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's power hour and now I'm trying to figure out why, despite all the times I've been to Mill, I've never been to Fat Tuesday until recently.

I got a pair of birthday cake shots (since apparently all anyone had gotten my friend through most of the night were shots of Fireball and tequila) and a Peach Bellini slushie, which was a godsend on a night that was most likely 100+ outside. The birthday cake shots were fantastic and the Peach Bellini was even better. 

Inside it was a little crowded, but still managed to be a comfortable temperature. The patio, on the other hand, had very few people so we were able to grab a table for our group right under the misters.

Really, the only irritating part was how pushy they were about getting people out the door once they closed and barely gave any warning to finish our drinks. But I can kind of understand the pushyness, considering it's Mill and the number of drunk college students they usually have to deal with."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesdays is an excellent choice to get a sweet fruit drink in a mug while walking the strip. You should keep your mug to save a few bucks on refills. Also, you can buy additional shots to make it even better. My suggestion if you add additional shots like 3, have them put the first one or two in the bottom, layer it with the frozen drink and then put the extra shot on top. MIX it before consuming!!!

Note you can try different flavors and they have flavor combination suggestions for you."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I walked in on a busy Friday night and within ten seconds I nearly slipped on their sticky floor. Fortunately I caught myself and didn't fall onto their nasty floor. As soon as that happen I got told by their bouncer I needed to leave because I appeared too drunk. I tried to explain to him what happened and the fact that I almost fell but he insisted I leave and not come back. I hadn't even drank anything yet. If this is how they want to do business then fine, I'll spend my money at other bars on Mill which I did."}
{"text":"The perfect spot to get way more alcohol than you should!!! If a young, beautiful bartender named Leilani is on shift, get ready for a great day! It's gonna be a strong drink with great service! Even as a local I visit this place again and again! It's a must if you're from out of town!"}
{"text":"Out of all the Fat Tuesday locations, this one is the best!

Let's face it, we all come here for the alcohol and to look cool while holding gigantic cups of daiquiri down the Strip, so I'm rating this place purely on how their drinks taste and the alcohol strength: strong!!!

All weekend long, I saw people holding either the Fat Tueaday cups or the 88oz guitar drinks from that one Hard Rock bar and was debating b/t the two. 

I'm glad I went with FT because their drinks were DELICIOUS and I never would have been able to finish 88oz of daiquiri by myself (bathroom anyone?). 

I got the bellini which is mainly champagne and some fruity juice and it is absolutely delicious and this is coming from a lightweight. I wanted to sip on it all day long!! 

My cousin got the 190 octane (the strongest drink) and he was gettin' pretty buzzed. We both got it right before our flight back home (great idea btw, security at the airport is so much more fun and you snooze through the whole flight). Next time, I'm getting it right when I land in Vegas so I can be happily buzzed all weekend. They offer cheaper refills if you keep the cup so if you think about it, you can start at the Caesar, walk towards Mandalay Bay and refill it multiple times along the way (at the Mirage, Planet Hollywood, etc) to keep your happiness level going strong all day. Yeah!!!!

Anyway, definitely a must-try when you're in town and all of the drinks taste good, so you can't go wrong. I got the second largest size and that was good enough for me. Only get the biggest size if you're ready to get sloshed. Good night!"}
{"text":"So we stopped by just about every Fat Tuesdays in Vegas, so each review will be the exact same copy with the exact same 5 stars because there was not a bad experience and this place is the place to start a poppin Vegas trip from 11am to 2am! (not sure how early they open but 11am was the earliest we started the rager!)

They have dozens of drink options and combinations and it all tastes so good! there was one drink i was not too fond of as much but i will get into that in a moment
I chose the $12 mug option which comes with $9 refills, and considering the club i went to the first night charged $17.50 for a Jack and Coke, these $9 refills lasting a good 2 hours were a pure joy!

the three drinks I ordered were:
Margarita: (refilled 2x) this was bomb.com like the best slushy margarita ever! sour sweet alcohol up the arse so good! 

Strawberry-Mango combo (refilled 3x) this was obviously my favorite, the strawberry mango combo was divine, not too sweet, punch of alcohol, oh so good

Superman: no refills, this was my least favorite, and what a shame being named after my favorite superhero! it is named because the two drink choices share the same colors, Eye Candy is blue, and i believe the 190 octane being red..i thought the Eye Candy would be a blue raspberry flavor but it was an over sweet cotton candy type..the combo wasnt my favorite and meh did not get a refill on this

you can't go to Vegas without getting crazy off Fat Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. Waitress to busy with friends to take care of us. Food was less then average. Two thumbs down"}
{"text":"Love Fat Tuesdays, All Day Happy Hour Tuesday! Such a great feeling to sit on the patio, have some great appetizers and people watch. We've done it about three times and each time we had a blast"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I stop in everytime that I make it to town. Oddly enough, there's a guy that works at this one that's from Arvada, CO and he repeatedly asks me why I'm there so often. 

My personal favorite is the 190 Octane. This is a slushy concoction of a partially frozen screwdriver (vodka and OJ) and then I typically add in 3 to 5 additional shots of grain alcohol. 

IF YOU DARE TO DO THIS, PLEASE REMEMBER TO MIX IN THE SHOTS AS YOU GO OR YOU WILL GET 3 to 5 STRAIGHT UP SHOTS OF EVERCLEAR AT THE END! 
That's a very important step. 

These things are so cold that the straw will freeze up in the dead middle of the summer when it's 110 outside, so you gotta keep drinking. Be careful though because they'll end you in a hurry.

They've got plenty of extras though and various drinks, so stop by. 

They also have 4 other strip locations, so try to plan 2 stops of your night jumping from one to the next. 

MGM Grand, Stratosphere, Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops, and I always forget the last one....damn."}
{"text":"My hubby and I shared the 44 magnum, which is the Cat 5 Hurricane and 190 Octane, and we had it with an extra shot of vodka. We bought the Fat Tuesday souvenir cup, so we can get a refill because they offer a couple of dollars off the refill - nice!  The drink is sweet, very strong (gives you a nice buzz), and enough to share amongst two people.  It's quite refreshing, especially in the hot Las Vegas sun."}
{"text":"Ya this stuff is pretty dangerous...

Located at the very end of the Caesars Forum shops is this hole in the wall. It was a school night and he wanted a drink.

They give you up to 2 samples so you can try various flavors and you can mix/match. The cups/glasses were kinda $$$, but if you tend to drink a lot (or share) and get multiple refills, then this is a bargain.

You can slurp this stuff down like a slushy!!!

Drinking on a school night?!

That = TROUBLE..."}
{"text":"I always end up at this bar when I go to mill because they have these huge drinks called groupies. They're huge... Like bigger than your head huge! You have to \"share\" with at least one other person. I always get the cherry limeade and it's dangerous because it goes down so easily! You'll get a nice groove going from those groupies... They're $20 each. Last night, I shared two with two friends and we were a bit lit LOL. 

Down side to this place: a lot of the people are overwhelmingly trashy and pretty ghetto. Lol sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"If your like frozen drinks, this is your place.  Had a hoping Mardi Gras party.  But I want more than just frozen cocktails at a bar."}
{"text":"Frozen drinks are a staple in Las Vegas. There are so many places to choose from but Fat Tuesday is probably the most widely known. I'm a mixer of flavors so I always try the strawberry and mix with a mango or similar flavor. They let you add in more shots of an alcohol of your choosing and stir it all up well for a fruity frozen concoction you must try in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Somebody needs to get Bar Rescue into this place. I walked inside and waited for somebody to take my order.  The atmosphere was too dark and somewhat musty. The bartender who finally welcomed me was arrogant and lazy. I ordered a beer and a burger. He laughed and replied that the cook wasn't in yet and commented that I looked like I ate a lot of burgers. If he was trying to be funny, it didn't work.

The worst thing any business can do is to insult the customer. It took everything I had not to slug him a good one. I kept my cool and promptly walked out."}
{"text":"This was stop 2 for my friends and I's awesome pre St Patty's Day drinking times. There was no line outside at about 10:15 ish. We got fireball shots for 3$ which is a good deal IMO, but other than that it was not so good. The slushies were a little on the gross side, too sweet. I got the strawberry marg and it was just too syrupy and too expensive for what you get (like 8$ for a 'large' which is not that large). The music was fine and the dancing was fun, but I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite bars."}
{"text":"WHOOOOO YAAAAAA this is what everyone talks about and wants to try. I ended up trying the one at Caesar's palace and even got a little show while waiting in line! I did have to walk through the mall for a bit, it's near the Nike Factory store.

When I got there, the line was pretty long but in no time was I at the front. I believe I got the mango and lemonade with tequila? I can't quite remember the weekend was a blur but I'm sure anything you get, it will be worth. The drink was slushy enough to mask the sting of the alcohol but you WILL taste it. It did get me to a good level (buzzed lol) but it didn't last long. The long stick that I got was enough for me and another friend to share, but they do have cup/mug sizes for those who don't want much. You can also carry these around as you walk! 

It's fun watching everyone else get their drinks, I think some guy got a yard! There is almost one Fat Tuesday in all the big hotels so they're everywhere on the strip. This is totally a traditional thing to try when you're in Vegas!! 

** I have the menu pic so hopefully it helps ya'll out in deciding your drink beforehand!"}
{"text":"Maybe the reason why I love Fat Tuesday so much is because I'm from PA, possibly the second most restrictive state in the USA with regards to alcohol...but I digress...

This place is AWESOME! I was expecting to pay a fortune when I wanted a drink at Caesar's (some of the standalone kiosks have drinks for over 50$...I'm not even kidding), until we came across Fat Tuesday. 

They had so many amazing flavors - I chose Electric Lemonade. It was blue and tasted amazing. Super strong as well. I bought the 14$ refillable cup and it was so strong that I didn't need a refill...HAHA.

Fat Tuesday is an absolute must on your trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"One word: BELLINI =]

Btw, don't get suckered into watching the Atlantis show in the middle of the courtyard! LOL. It's NOT the business."}
{"text":"I've done my fair share of daquiri type alcohol drink experimentation and I strongly urge you to skip straight to Fat Tuesdays when in Vegas. Yes the other places try to lure you in with create cups of all shapes but their drinks never fail to be all sugar and little alcohol.

FT has it down to a science, you get great taste and more than you're bang for your buck where alcohol is concerned. You can mix flavors if you want AND for $2an extra shot of 151 rum. Seriously this place can't be beat!! I always get the tumbler and just come back for the $10 refills. It's enough to get you drink with out having to carry a ridiculously sized/shaped cup up and down the strip. Just trust me and go here first!"}
{"text":"Omg. If you're looking for a big drink, you're going here. If not, you're dumb & don't deserve to enjoy Las Vegas the way you're supposed to."}
{"text":"Love FAT TUESDAY when i'm in VEGAS!

I've been to all the Fat Tuesday location and honestly this location had the crappiest service ever! Did not ask if I wanted an extra shot with my drink and they just poured my drink and I paid and that's it. They were not polite or nothing... also the location is horrible! Its inside the Caesars Forum shops like all the way at the end.. so yeah I love  FAT TUESDAY but not this location not worth going all the way into the shoppes for..."}
{"text":"excellent frozen drinks. super strong. Loud music and a young crowd. We usually stop in for 1 drink and move on."}
{"text":"A must when hitting any spot that has a Fat Tuesdays. I got a $1 off coupon from a friend and got the Mango and Strawberry mixed with an extra shot. It was the best. Love Fat Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This is a great idea. They need to exist in more places. I wish the yard was a little cheaper, 48 ounces of slushy alcohol is basically nothing to me ha ha. But it was my first time and I loved it, I would definitely come back. Love, love, love."}
{"text":"Delicious frozen fruit magic!  I got Cat 5 Hurricane with Bacardi 151.  Despite that, I'm still not sure how much alcohol is actually in there.  I'd recommend getting at least one extra shot to make all those calories worthwhile."}
{"text":"I love Fat Tuesday's they are awesome. I may not visit them as often as I would like but my current visit wasn't what I would expect. The bartender did not try to up sale which I didn't like. This is the only place I wish they would inform about specials. They are fast at what they do. A plus. But They are extremely out of the way for locals.. Which I guess I understand but wish there was a locals location."}
{"text":"This place is really good. They really have something for everyone. Extra house shots in the slush drinks are only $1 each. 

Their priced from about $5 to 100oz for $40. These are the slush drink prices."}
{"text":"Not a beer place. Not a burger place. Not even a friendly place. 

I sat at a bar on a Wednesday night, the bartender took a little while to recognize me even though the bar was empty. Here you can have multiple flavor daiquiris, served frozen. But I tried a sample of the Octane, felt like I was drinking ice. No flavor whatsoever, didn't even taste the alcool in it. So I had a Purple Haze Ale instead. Nothing exciting, but I kept drinking it. 

Let's switch to food. Menu looks nice, I went with the Swiss burger (cooked RARE) with the caramelized onions. A complete disappointment. First of all, the burger took 20 minutes to cook, I already predicted it was not going to be rare. Second, these people have no idea what caramelized onions are. Cause there were actually raw onions in it. When I made my complaint, the bartender said: \"Oh we just sautéed the onions.\" Great, is this your highest level of refinement?? So he comped it and I got another one. Second burger was actually medium rare, I appreciate the improvement. Still, with raw onions in it. 

Sweet potato fries were good. The only good thing about it. Bartender and other staff members are not friendly. They don't greet people at the beginning, no smile, no care. When it was actually time to pay the bill, the bartender sort of showed he was finally paying attention, and he cleared the plate in front of me. 
Yeah well, too late. You already lost your tip 30 minutes ago. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Always get an extra shot.  If you are a raging alcoholic this is pretty much just a slurpee.  Pace yourself cuz this stuff is full of sugar.  Its a good drink to become bigger than Tuesday.  Hence Fatty Tuesday."}
{"text":"Buying a drink from Fat Tuesday is part of the Vegas Vacation Tradition. Everyone has to walk the Strip with a yard of slushy goodness. My daiquiri of choice is the 190 Octane with an extra shot, but it's fun to try all the flavors. You could also mix them together. Once I have had a Strawberry Daiquiri mixed with Pina Colada. I would give this place 5 stars but it can get really sweet, You could feel a film of sugar form on your teeth, but it's totally worth it for the taste and the buzz."}
{"text":"1st time trying this place. I'm not much of a drinker. I got the hurricane Cat 5 or whatever. It was good but I'm regretting that extra shot. I am a light weight and just had that and one other drink at a bar and got sick the next day unfortunately!"}
{"text":"I saw so many people with Fat Tuesdays and I finally was able to find one. Half-yard of mango rum for only $12. Add an extra shot for only $1.

Great way to start the afternoon as you can bring this while you are shopping or site seeing. The mango rum tastes quiet strong so be warned ahead of time for all those 1 shot wonders.

Seems like lots of people are recommending the 190 octane so I definitely need to try that next time I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love alcohol slurpees?  Oh wait, alcohol slurpees with an extra shot?  OH WAIT alcohol slurpees that actually taste good??  You had me at Vegas.

The best way to do this place is with a bunch of people, get a bunch of flavors and straws and slurp your way down the strip.  Haha, slurp.  Anyway, seriously, this place has a bunch of flavors, you can mix and match as you wish or follow their recipes that they have printed on the sides of the bar.  There's Peach bellini, 190 Octane, Raging Bull (red bull flavor), pina colada, andddd a bunch more that I can't remember because uhhhh yeah alcohol??  

The jello shots are also really good, you can't taste any of the alcohol but it'll hit you like a mack truck if you do too many.  You be the judge of how many is too many.  

Always always always get an extra shot, it's a dollar and they give you either Bacardi 151 or some other vodka which is 153 proof sooooo drink up and hope to God that you remember the night.  Cheers."}
{"text":"A must if you go to Vegas! They let you try different flavors and combinations. My wife and I stop here at least once every trip."}
{"text":"Fun place, staff is super friendly, lots of attractvie girls and dancing. Went on a Sat and the DJ was great. I really enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to go on during their happy hour! Seriously those daiquiris are so freaking delicious and so sneaky! After drinking just 3/4 of it I was really starting to feel it! We had so much fun together as a family just enjoying Fat Tuesday's happy hour, we've been here multiple times and have always had an awesome time! The only reason I give it a four star is because this place is known for their drinks not the food all they offer is just standard bar foods that are nothing spectacular or worth noting but this is just a great place to get a drink 8/10"}
{"text":"To me, this is an essential part of Vegas. If you don't have a Fat Tuesday in your hand, you're not doin' it right. 

My favorite is to mix one of the stronger ones like 190 Octane with Strawberry and Mango to sweeten it up a little. 

The great thing about Fat Tuesday besides the most delicious drinks is the discount on refills if you bring back the container!  

This location in Caesar's is nice, but can be cramped if there's a line.  Nice thing is the line moves pretty quickly and if you time it right you can watch the show in the center while you wait. ;)"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to love this place. The set-up is fantastic, with its Icee-esque alcoholic beverages and some of the best DJs I've heard in Arizona.

I went with a gay couple, and the three of us had just gotten a round of drinks (our first drinks) and were dancing to \"Call Me Maybe\". One of the guys threw his arms around his boyfriend's shoulders for about two, perhaps three, seconds and immediately went back to dancing solo--and within five more seconds two guards told us that we were \"too drunk\" and had to \"leave immediately\". They ushered us out forcibly. We were, of course, completely sober--and when I realized what was most likely the cause of this \"drunk\" verdict I was so angry I was shaking.

Fat Tuesday, you will never get my service again if you respond to your paying customers with discrimination. I will be telling others about this occurrence."}
{"text":"I had the mudslide, it was delicious also the patio area was very relaxing and the perfect place to watch the show in the Forum shops in Ceasars Palace...the drink was only $10, very reasonable for Vegas."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesdays was pretty busy for a Friday night but we were able to sit after about 15 minute wait.  It was girls night so the waitress told us right away that they don't do separate checks on the weekends because it takes up too much time.  She explained that we should transfer money to each other through Venmo or something like that.  I think that is super inconvenient to ask one person to pay the tab.  She did end up splitting it but just as a heads up.  

Now the most important part, the drinks and food were delicious!  None of us were disappointed with anything.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There are a lot of places to visit on Mill Avenue . . . however, there is no place like Fat Tuesday!   When we visit Tempe, we always make it a point to stop at \"Fats\".   We have always visited before the night time crowd comes.  When we walk in the door, the bartenders remember us, suggest yummy drinks, ask about us . . . treat us like we are special.   We have struck up many conversations with other patrons who enjoy going to Fat Tuesdays as much as we do.  During the day it''s a great place to just get out of the heat, cool off with their daquiris and eat a delicious Po Boy.  Jason is our favorite bartender . . . and we have lots of laughs with him!   I am counting the days until weI will be back in AZ to go to Fat Tuesday!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places I love visiting when i am in Vegas! 

I usually get the original mug size mudslide!

It's so delicious and tastes like a Frap from Starbucks! This place usually gives you a dollar off card for your next refill.

To refill mine, it would've been only 7 bucks! Which is good. 

The line here is never long, and this is the only place that carries the flavor: mudslide so come here!!!!! 

Love you Fat Tuesday! What would I drink if you weren't here?!"}
{"text":"I just think of how I love Icee's and then I think about how much I love alcohol..and then I think of  Fat Tuesdays because I can have BOTH!!!

Thanks to the suggestion by Kyra R. we headed on over, our crew of girls celebrating Maritel C.s bachelorette weekend in Vegas! ! 

I ordered the bellini with an extra shot and started off the afternoon with a punch! ! 

Sit outside and try to catch  the show..the statues moving and talking and spewing out fire!!! You'll know what I'm talking about if you're there!"}
{"text":"Booze slushies are awesome and the DJ played great music. Fun environment and fun people!"}
{"text":"Couldn't get enough of this stuff.  As soon as I got picked up from the airport by my friends we headed out to Fat Tuesday. I tried the mango and strawberry with a shot of everclear and they were both really really good.  That shot towards the end really hits you and it makes it so much better!  The staff really earns their tips unlike other bartenders who just expects you to tip them because you're in Vegas.  I even got a free shot on my bday!  I will always hit this spot when I go out there.  Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Sure it's a bit scuzzy, but they have a wall of freakin' Slurpee machines filled with booze.  

It's really the antithesis of everything a good cocktail should be.  And I should hate it.  But I don't.  Part of the problem comes from growing up in Miami.  

The national drink of the Florida Keys is the Rum Runner.  It's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of Miami.  But Fat Tuesday's has it.  Well, all Fat Tuesday's besides this one.  WTF.  

I was surprised to see that they have a drink made with Pyrat rum.  And it was fine.  But it wasn't the Fat Tuesday's experience of my youth that I was hoping for. 

Where did the Rum Runner go?

Well, the bartender explained that they had to take out a few machines to make room for additional bottles of booze.  Apparently someone had the bright idea that Fat Tuesdays should actually mix cocktails besides just pour frozen boozy slushies into plastic cups.  

Whoever had that idea should be fired.

Boozy slushies in plastic cups is what this place is about.  And in the heat of a Tempe summer a Rum Runner would be just about perfect.  But they are gone because apparently some fool thought it would be a good idea to sell cosmos too."}
{"text":"A slurpee with an extra shot or two. This is a nice cool treat when it's 107 degrees outside. The three days in Vegas we came across three different Fat Tuesday's. We tried the mojito, 190 octane and cat 5 hurricane. If you go there make sure to keep your cup so that you can get the refill at a discount price. The slushie is a bit syrupy but has a decent flavor to it. It's a nice alternative to a 40 oz of malt liquor, but give me a regular cocktail any day."}
{"text":"Yum! Great place for a cheap buzz! Everything is absolutely delicious, and the test tubes of everclear really top it off! My favorites so far are the mudslide and the amaretto pineapple, but I would really love to try the pina colada-strawberry mashup next time (next week...?) I love you , fat tuesday!"}
{"text":"Vegas experience is incomplete without a Fat Tuesday. I was told this was one of those things I HAD to get, and it totally is."}
{"text":"why does anyone go to fat tuesday?! to get your inebriation on! and thats exactly what we did...but I gotta recommend the bellini flavor! so yummy!! the boys got the octane 190 and it tastes like orange juice...but be warned-- it WILL get you there! drink at your own risk! they do have everclear to add to your drink...if youre into that~ oh and theres not really an inside to this place...its just a counter where you order and the \"chippery\"--which honestly i couldnt even say what that is?!"}
{"text":"Best place in the Valley to spend Mardi Gras (at least for now.)
I'm Catholic and have grown to enjoy the Fat Tuesday tradition that the day before the beginning of Lent and Ash Wednesday one goes a little wild preceding the sacrifice that is Lenten season. Maybe I just love a good party. 
I've been to New Orleans for Mardi Gras and for many years went to Mardi Gras in St Louis. Even here in the Valley of the Sun, 10 years ago there was a really good Mardi Gras party at a bar called Sugar Daddies (now long closed.) 
I have been going to Fat Tuesday on Mill for probably the last 5-6 years for their Fat Tuesday/Mardi Gras party. By now, you would think they would have perfected their biggest night the year. They have yet to figure out to create that perfect Bourbon Steet on Mill Ave vibe. I think mostly due to poor organization and lack of understanding of the original. Therefore, what should be a growing attendance each year seems almost to be slightly dwindling in size. 
However, until I make it back to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, I still have a good enough time that I find myself coming back each year to Fat Tuesday on Mill for what is the biggest Mardi Gras party in the Valley."}
{"text":"Nice and chill place. Perfect for hanging out with friends and relaxing. I love this place. Awesome drinks and food. The service was awesome as well. I look forward to coming here again. :)"}
