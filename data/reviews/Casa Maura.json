{"text":"Very friendly staff and hard working chef. Not a real Italian restaurant - processed pepperino slices - and mostly canned/bottled condiments. Reasonably priced but will not return."}
{"text":"Four first time visitors were more than pleasantly surprised. The filet of sole was excellent, as were the osso bucco and the veal. The service was a bit sketchy, but the owner/cook was enthousiastic and did an excellent job. Worth more than one visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing thin crust pizza.  Very good pasta.  Owner takes pride in his restaurant."}
