{"text":"Went to Rico's because it was late and we were staying at the resort.  The place was practically empty on a Saturday night. The service was very slow. I ordered a glass of wine which took 10 minutes to arrive. I ordered a Mexican chopped salad and my boyfriend ordered a burger. The salad was a disaster. Limp, stale bagged lettuce, bland chicken and watery dressing with no taste at all. I sent it back after 2 bites. The server was not surprised  at all.  Seems like this may be a frequent occurrence. The burger was better but still not good. Soggy bun, and not quite cooked. To their credit we weren't charged for the salad.  Better to go off site for a good meal if you are staying here."}
{"text":"We were in AZ on a family trip. We came to Rico's on Father's Day for a nice weekend brunch. Our server was Debbie and she couldn't have made it a better experience. She was extremely personable, very attentive, and gave us the best recommendations on the menu. Some of the best service I've ever had. I would highly recommend coming and requesting her as your server. We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Ah, Rico's, I sure wanted to like you.  Located in the former Lantana Grill, you are the same but with a pickaxe and shovel on the wall.  Same buffet at breakfast, now priced $18.50.  I'm sure it's ok if you want a buffet, or a fresh omelette but that's not my usual style.  

I have to say your salmon benedict ($13.85) was very tasty, a nice salmon on a crispy muffin with a perfect egg.  The potatoes however looked greasy, flabby and probably right off the buffet.  That's exactly how they tasted.  Ugh.  And my orange juice at $4 for 4oz, well, let's just say for that price it had better be freshly hand squeezed by virgins and not poured into a carafe from a box.  This was not fresh juice.

Your website says \"Rico's American Grill brings high-quality, farm-to-table cuisine at an affordable price.\"  I disagree. With places like Scramble offering better food, better prices as well as free wi-fi, you are only going to gouge your Hotel guests, not your local neighbors: so we'll stay away."}
{"text":"Decided to visit Rico's because it is close to the hotel I am staying at. The server was courteous and attentive. I only had cocktails and appetizers. I had the calamari and seafood cocktail and I highly recommend both."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment! The boyfriend and I were celebrating out anniversary by staying at the Pointe and decided to try this place for dinner on a Saturday night. At first we thought it was closed because there were no cars in the parking lot and the massive patio was completely empty, even though it was a gorgeous night outside. We walked in and were seated quickly in the empty restaurant (on a Saturday night!). Our waitress came over and greeted us by saying \"you guys have been sitting here for a long time, right?\" Ummm... no, but thanks for asking?! She was barely able to get through the specials. She was either on something or from another planet. We were now creeped out by the empty restaurant and confused waitress and left without ordering anything. We went to Tutti Santi across the street. A much better option."}
{"text":"I ordered the Squaw peak Bennie. Description \"Blue corn biscuit topped with grilled Chorizo, avocado, tomatoes and two poached eggs covered in Adobo hollandaise. The Biscuit was dry and tasted stale. I think it was made of stale Scone mix. The eggs were slightly overdone. You really can't get sliced avocado and tomato wrong. Here's the kicker. If your gona do a Bennie you MUST get the hollandaise right. In this category I have to give them an epic FAIL! Let's look past the fact that there was no trace of Adobo flavor in the sauce and concentrate on the sauce it's self. All I tasted was butter and salt. No lemon or pepper at all. Maybe I'm a snob but if your doing a Benedict do it right! Good service and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This was the second time in 2 days that we ate at Ricos. Both times the service was very good, the food was excellent and the atmosphere is good too. I'm at a conference at the hotel so it's an easy choice, but I'd eat here if I was local, too. Not a huge menu but the calamari, flatbreads and sandwiches were all very good. Rock solid."}
{"text":"Mother's day wrecked.  Thanks Rico's.  I called ahead, asked of outdoor seating in the shade, mentioned that I need two booster seats. Well.... They sat us in the sun, had one booster seat and had to send out to another restaurant for another... That one arrived and had broken supports.  The manager could not be bothered, and the manager above her was a boring guy who did not seem to care.  It was so bad that our server cried at the table.  I am not kidding.

The bar is where I usually go, and well.... They don't mess up beer."}
{"text":"Food was less than I would have expected from a resort style restaurant.  Service was great for both dinner and breakfast.  We are here for 3 days and we will not be returning for any of our other meals.  I always give places 2 shots and well , they failed both times. Sorry..."}
{"text":"My mother and I are staying at the Hilton by this restaurant and have eaten a light dinner and lunch there during our weekend stay. The atmosphere is light and it wasn't overly crowded so we were seated right away which was nice. Service and food were great!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner while staying at the Pointe Hilton squaw peak hotel. Dinner was delicious. I had the Macaroni and 5 cheeses with grilled chicken and my wife had the Baja fish tacos. We both tried each other's and they were awesome. Recommend to anyone in the area give it a try"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch. Wanted the chicken Caesar salad but it came mixed, romaine and kale. I asked if they could do just romaine and they said they can't separate the kale out of the salad but they can give me an all kale salad. No thanks. Then I had to switch to the bison burger and sweet potato fries which I was told they are out of sweet potato fries.  Are you kidding me?? Who does your ordering? Not everyone likes kale and how can you be out of sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for business and use YELP all of the time, however I have never taken the time to write a review. In this case I have to agree with Al and give a public service announcement to avoid this place.
I was a guest at the hotel and had coupons for food purchases, so I did the Breakfast buffet, not bad but how can you ruin breakfast.
Lunch and dinner is quite a different story.

I was with a group of friends who wanted to eat dinner here so I joined them. After studying the menu I concluded they must just be trying to be different as there was not one item I thought looked appetizing. The combinations of ingredients were just strange. 

All of the items I decided to try were just poor quality and tasteless.
The last night of my stay at the hotel I had a few food coupons left so I decided to just get a burger, pretty hard to ruin a burger, besides it was free ($13.95 without a coupon). I had the house burger with blue cheese, it was so overpowering all you could taste was blue cheese. Turns out I preferred the tasteless food.

If you don't mind spending $17.95 for breakfast OK, but skip the other meals."}
{"text":"We made our reservations for Thanksgiving dinner here, calling the number on their flier. When we called, they said they had 3pm or 4pm available; we thought this was unusual since the Thanksgiving flier stated seatings for 1,3, or 5pm. However, we booked for 4pm as it was offered and preferable to us. 

We arrived at 4pm only to be told that was a mistake; our options were to wait until 5pm (inconvenient as we live 30 minutes away) or be seated then. We were assured that it was just fine as they had a table open.

However, we soon found that all the food was picked over by the the 3pm visitors. Many of the entries were entirely empty - no turkey, no sweet potatoes, no stuffing, etc. Other \"hot entries\" were available but cold such as the steak. And, many of the \"cold\" horsd'oerves were no longer cold. Both of these are HUGE health risks!!! Finally, after four visits with waits in between we were finally able to get hot food; the food placed out for the 5pm guests. Unfortunately, by this point in time one of the members of management was GLARING at us every time he saw us.

To top it off, the table cloth was four times the right size for our table, dragging a good foot plus on the ground and becoming a huge tripping hazard!! They were out of iced tea glasses. Finally, we got some, but they were dirty. Many plates were also half-hazardly cleaned (i.e. dirty). 

We asked to speak to the manager to explain the situation due to the glares from the male worker, who we thought was the manager, but were turned down and told it was just fine that we were there at off hours and not to worry. However, when of the members of management GLARES constantly at you, it's hard not to."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon & my husband & I decided to have lunch somewhere on a patio. I suggested Rico's since I had been wanting to try it for a lil while now & we made our way over. We walked in & the hostess brought us out to the back patio. It was a cute lil area with a few tables, a ping pong table, couches & a fire place for colder weather. Some of the cushions had bird shit on em & the taller tables were a bit wobbly, but no biggie, we sat at a shorter table & avoided the dirty chair cushions. 

I felt like having a beer so I ordered the Sun Up Armadillo & opted for a pitcher. I should have just stuck to a small glass since I had never tried it before, we did not care for it. For an app we ordered the jumbo pretzel off of the bar menu. For $8 I thought they could have included 1 or 2 more, but they were yummy & the queso it came with was delish. For our entrees my hubby ordered the Rico's dip & I ordered their signature steak (med-rare) & fries. He loved his sandwich (enough for 2) & the house-made kettle chips were amazing. My new york strip with chimichurri sauce was excellent & the fries were tasty as well. I have to add that they also make their own ketchup (that has a bit of a kick to it) & is great with the fries & even the chips. 

Total (not including tip) was about $62, a lil pricey but the food was great so we'd definitely return. They have happy hour everyday from 3-7 with some awesome deals, so I'd like to return during hh & also sit at the patio up front which had a lot more shade & tables."}
{"text":"Another Pointe disappointment. Hotel food. I know they don't need to offer quality as they have a built in clientele but it would be nice if they tried to anway."}
{"text":"Shrimp scampi was not very good.  The sauce was too watery and the overall dish was bland."}
{"text":"The fish tacos, mac and cheese, and apple skillet were delicious!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing, especially being associated with the adjacent Hilton property. Service is inconsistent and at times very unfriendly. There is nothing special about the food....might as well be eating at Denny's.

We did happy hour one night and it was also mediocre.  However, the bar server on that experience was very helpful and friendly. Food and drink options are not the best on happy hour which is likely why the place was virtually empty during happy hour."}
{"text":"The buffet had the standard fare, including an omelet station. The quality of the food was very good, especially the muffins, croissants and bacon. My wife is usually picky about breakfast and she really liked this. The regular price for the buffet is around $16 for adults and $9 for children. They also have menu items you can order for breakfast. We had the same server every day and she was very attentive and gave us tips about visiting the area as well. The only downside was the hostess who seemed to be in a daze every time and we would have to tell her multiple times we didn't need menus since we would do the buffet."}
{"text":"Stopped by Ricos because we're staying at the resort. Overall it was everything I would expect from a resort restaurant. Food was solid but nothing amazing. Price was expensive for the quality of food. 

I had the bistro steak and it was cooked just right. The sides were ok but very salty. My wife had a burger and it was average.

Overall nothing great but not bad if you're looking for something easy close by the resort"}
{"text":"Ugh about sums it up.  Dirty silverware on the table and had to ask for new.  The server was clearly put out by this request. Food was on par with cafeteria quality and two of our meat dishes were under-cooked. It was the off season and not even busy, but the service sucked  The restaurant is located at the resort, so they have easy pickings for tired families just getting to the resort. This place is crazy expensive and not worth it.  You are better to leave the resort and drive a half mile down the street for real food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right by the hotel we were staying in. We went in for a quick brunch. We waited almost an hour for a burrito and a bowl of fruit.  Food was good but customer service this particular day was not at its best."}
{"text":"I've been dreaming of Rico's pretzel bread since the Holiday Sweater OYE and I'm happy to say that I've finally made it back for more.

Rico's has a great happy hour from 3-7 everyday in the bar area with drink specials and half off appetizers from the bar menu.  I was SO happy to see that the pretzel bread (with a side of nacho cheese and mustard) was on the menu. I also had an enormous plate of nachos and an order of meatballs.  All were a step above average bar food.

While the bartender was doing a fantastic job of keeping everyone's glass full, I did have an uncomfortable experience with another server who thought it was ok to interrupt my meal to ask personal questions.  I'm talking questions that started out as inappropriate and ended as insulting. 

I'll definitely be back for the pretzels and beer, but I'll probably do a better job of keeping my head down in order to avoid unwanted conversation."}
{"text":"Checking your dish wear! Two of our glasses had green stuff, don't know if old food or algae. Service slow, 10 minutes after seating to anyone coming by. We walked out, don't trust the kitchen."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast at Rico's on a Saturday, and did not have the best experience!

We opted for the breakfast buffet, and the food was nothing spectacular! Better than a Denny's, but probably not worth the price.

Additionally, the service was not good! Our waitress seemed to be upset that we started the buffet without letting her know, which I totally understand! But she continued to be rude to us throughout the rest of the meal, including shaking the bill and asking if we had provided our card yet (which we had).

I wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great wait staff! Our waiter was very knowledgeable, helpful, and enthusiastic. Loved the southwestern food and ambiance. The chopped salad was a definite favorite. We went twice on our stay because we had to try everything!"}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet was decent. They also had build your own omelette which I'm already a big fan of! Great place to try if you are staying at the Squaw Peak Resoet!"}
{"text":"They couldn't care less that you are here, trapped at the Hilton.  Get a cab. Take the shuttle.  When the waitress suggested to my  5 year old to \"hurry up, I'm busy\" on her lemonade vs milk division, the downhill descent started.  In our charming waitresses defense, it was nearly 50% full.  
The worst fish tacos I've ever had.  No fish.  Dry. Possibly because our charming waitress instructed the kitchen to F it up, but \"The Worst\" none the less. 
I received a 15% discount on a future meal. Not.  Gonna. Happen."}

____________________

Well, wasn't he just a little pervert???

So, while burning calories from melting beneath the Phoenix sun (no pun intended), no doubt was I looking to mimic Gerardo and get my \"RIGO\" suave on?

Lack of available hotel amenities and/or a short walk inevitably led me here.

Resting on North 16th, this Pointe Hilton adjacent noshery places a spin on Southwestern cuisine with a flare that ONLY Phoenix, itself can provide!

With more than ample outside seating, a bar that goes on for days and stellar customer service, I'm proud to state that \"Rico's\" is suave!

Wasting no time, in true lush fashion I requested a double BLT ($10.95) and my signature spicy margarita. 

Arriving in light speed, it's obvious the bartender took my \"innocence\" as a challenge because 4 days later and damned if it didn't burn once going in and TWICE on the way back out!

Tack on, more bacon than a swine farm with a damned good salad and 15% off provided by way of a single Yelp check in and -

Ahh eh ahh ehhh!!!!!,

Y usted seor? Don't ask why my chin's on the floor!!!

Hey Yelp, shhhhh.

Caus' I think I've just located my newest Arizona addiction!"}
{"text":"So I wish I had something good to say but.... I don't. I spend the weekend in the Hilton resort and came here for 4 deserts. I went and ordered 2 creme brûlée, 1 cast iron cookie and 1 brownie! It took 40 freaking minutes!!!!! And when I asked for a refund and told them I wasn't going to wait any longer I got a \"okay it's coming soon\" which is bad customer service. When we actually got the desert and walked back to the resort it wasn't even the correct freaking order!!!! The cookie sucked bad! The creme brûlée was cold and not very good! I came here for a mother's day get away and that totally killed the good vibe we had going! I wouldn't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. It opens at 7 am and I got there about 730-7:45am and was the first person. 
Handicap access was confusing. The ramp lead to a door that was locked.  Once inside everyone was extremely accommodating. The buffet is fresh. There are many stations including an omelette station; a bread toast station; a pastry table; a cold salad area that included caprese salad, cheese, salami, and fruit; a yogurt parfait station that had at least six different toppings including granola and coconut pumpkin seeds; and juices. They also had eggs to order and I got two poached eggs; they were perfect.  The cheese on the cold food table was exceptional and I probably ate too much of it! 
If lunch is an unknown this is a great way to start the day. I was full a long time.
As luck would have it, my meeting attendees decided to go for lunch here. I got the miners salad with spinach added and no pick de Gallo. It came as ordered and was light. Thank God! I was still full from breakfast. 3 of 4 of us got salads and everyone finished them. The potsticker salad came with a reputation and my friend said it lived up to it. 
This is a solid 3.5 star but I'm rounding up because the service was good, the place was clean, and I would return if staying at the Hilton next door."}
{"text":"I eat here frequently as I stay at the adjoining Hilton when I'm in town, and the breakfast vouchers are generous. The steak and eggs ($15) features a good cut of meat (I think it's a flank steak), 2 eggs anyway you want them, with corn salsa and toast and potatoes. The servers are always amenable to allowing me to change out the sides for lots of fruit. I love the mustard available at the table, the fact that they have Chilulah hot sauce on hand, and will bring out some salsa at no extra cost. The staff are pretty attentive.  I call ahead to avoid having to wait in the breakfast rush. I have also had an omelet which was substantial in size and quite tasty, with unlimited ingredients for about $12."}
{"text":"I had a great meal the other day. My server David was very knowledgeable on the food. Also the host Craig was very nice and polite. It was an all around enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Starting with the friendly greeting .. Fantastic bartender (L) and much improved menu from the Lantana days. Tried the Margherita flatbread pizza and BBQ chicken flatbread pizza. They were both great!! Yes we will be back! 
Just add veggie burgers please.."}
{"text":"My friend and I stayed here for four days and had breakfast here for three. The food was good all three days. The first day the service was excellent. The lady was very polite and on point. The next two days we came back as we have breakfast vouchers included in our stay. Debra was our server and was ok. At the end she mentioned these vouchers cover everything but gratuity which is appreciated. Of course we are going to leave a tip. Today we had her again and said please don't forget gratuity is appreciated. I find it pretty rude that she has to ask for money especially as the vouchers clearly state gratuity is not included. The first day the lady did not say that and received a generous tip. Debra says this and it honestly makes me not want to tip. I did but was not happy with her. 10+ stars to everyone one else and their attitudes."}
{"text":"I'll admit I wasn't complete sure about the place. Everything on the resort is rather Pricey. I got here about 10 to 11 and they serve lunch till 11!  However they would have let me have breakfast if I wanted it but Yelp had the 15% off coupon for lunch.  So I opted for lunch. I wasn't sure what to have Debbie the server suggested the squaw peak chopped salad. It was actually really good!
Filling too! 

I had the bottomless mimosa for 12.00 also. No brainer there!  7.00 for one or endless for 12.00!!  I figured what the heck. My last \"day\" here. Might as well!  

As I was leaving. I was offered a mimosa to go!!!!  Score!   Can't go wrong there!!"}
{"text":"We went here because it is part of the Hilton resort, unfortunately my chicken didn't taste fresh. They ran out of martinis glasses and they served our second round in some random glasses that were not very appealing. Service was OK so was the rest of the food."}
{"text":"This place was solicited on the internet as a great Valentines Day spot.  Being that it had the Hilton name, I booked a reservation.  The food, service, and ambiance is just  step up from Denny's though.  Not what was expected at all."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, excellent service, disappointing food. I had the salmon, which was well well done (they didn't ask for a temp). Came with 4 beet chunks and a spoonful of parsnip purée. Way under seasoned, and no salt on the table. Other entrees were also meh, with the exception of the steak melt sandwich, which got rave reviews from my slightly drunk gma. 

Server was excellent, but the kitchen just wasn't on their game."}
{"text":"Good food for a hotel restaurant. Service is a bit slow so expect to spend a while. But every single server was super nice and accommodating.

Friendly, Fresh and Convenient for the resort guests!"}
{"text":"As a guest of the Point Hilton Squaw Resort, my meals were pretty much planned and catered. On my last evening there, I went over to Ricos as it was on the hotel grounds. I regretted it as it was my only time there in what I was about to experience. I ordered their Beer & Blue Cheese Mussels, as a huge fan of mussels I was blown away at this restaurant's adaption. They steamed the mussels in a concoction of beer and blue cheese, upon serving the beer blended with the blue cheese and created a creamy sauce with chucks of blue cheese that surrounded all the mussels. Had I ventured to Ricos my first night, this item would've been ordered several times over the next 5 days."}
{"text":"A hungry nun is a scary nun. Thanks to Rico's I was able to witness this firsthand. 

On the lookout for a lunch on Sunday I chose Rico's. I had some family in town, including my aunt the nun. We were seated quickly in a nearly empty restaurant. 

Menus were handed out promptly, after which our server disappeared. We all made up our minds and prepared to order. The restaurant had an almost desolate quality to it, due to the quiet emptiness surrounding us. 

We waited... 

Finally our server came out to take our orders. Meatloaf sandwiches and burgers were ordered by all. 

We waited... 

A half our later polite conversation was exhausted. I noticed a steely glint in the eye of the nun. Still no food. 

We waited... 

45 minutes later our food arrived. Keep in mind there were literally no other customers in the place. The meatloaf sandwich was decent, though it was a little dry. The sweet potato fries were a flaccid, tasteless afterthought. The burgers were well received and cooked to order. Finally the nun was at peace with the world, though she was also disappointed in the meatloaf. 

It's possible that our timing was bad. Maybe we came in at the tail end of a massive brunch crowd or something. I'm willing to give Rico's another chance. 

Still, I don't I'll be going back to Rico's if there's a nun in my party."}
{"text":"My family of six and I stayed at the Hilton next door to Ricos. We dined at their breakfast/brunch buffet twice during a weekday on our vacation and were very happy with the service and quality of the food. 
Our waitress was \"Grace.\" She was very happy to see us on both days and was very attentive with our needs. The grill/omelette chef was equally as friendly with a genuine desire to connect with the patrons. Even down to the host/hostess, we were quite pleased with this restaurant and would happily return."}
{"text":"Here for brunch.  Ordered Sqawk Peak Bennie with Bloody Mary and a juice.  However I received a coffee instead.  Mary was a bit watered down. Then the waitress brings my husband and I both the wrong meals.  He ate his because he didn't want to wait.  I sent mine back for the correct order.  Not a great way to start the day. The kids received cute puzzle menus without crayons. The interior is nice and warm."}
{"text":"Rico's American Grill has become one of our favorite spots for a special outing. Specifically the Easter buffet is hands down the best in Phoenix. They had an omelette station with all sorts of breakfast goodies and a lunch buffet line that contained ham, roast beef carving station delicious side dishes for comfort food and a wonderful carved ice sculpture dispensing peel and eat shrimp! Hats off to our server Grace and manager Amanda who saw that our Easter outing was most special. We will be back! (I only hope that they add a Thanksgiving Day buffet!)"}
{"text":"Whether you're a long time resident of The Valley or you are visiting for work or vacation, a visit to Rico's is a must. Located in Hilton's beautiful Squaw Peak Resort, this place offers great food in an atmosphere that provides plenty of space for your large parties, or a quiet booth for date nights. Their menu includes several items that contain ingredients that are grown and cultivated on-site in their thriving garden. The interior reminds me of a lodge with its open spaces and high, vaulted ceilings. I enjoyed the fact that they paid homage to the areas mining history by showing some pictures of the workers and mining equipment from the early 1900's. 

My fiancé and I were there for dinner, but seeing the omelet station and breakfast menu already had me thinking about my next visit. Let's start out with the staff. They were all WONDERFUL!! Our server kept our water glasses topped off and was always checking to see how we were doing. The manager came out and chatted with us several times to talk about the food and drinks. And by the way, he is also the mixologist. He has created some unbelievable combinations for cocktails by taking more of a culinary approach with finding ingredients that blend together to make the drink an experience to remember. We sampled the handcrafted Sedona Special, Your Grandma's Favorite, and the Strawberry-Jalapeño Margarita. They were ALL delicious!!!! My favorite was the Strawberry-Jalapeño Margarita. It was spicy and sweet and hard to limit myself to just one. They also have a great selection of draft beer all from Arizona. 

The food was also terrific. We started out with the Wagyu Beef Brisket Sliders, Rocky Point Shrimp Gazpacho, and the Warm Spinach, Bacon & Roasted Tomato Dip. All were delicious, especially the Spinach and Bacon Dip! It made me melt into the booth with a smile on my face. As noted on the menu, this item is made with ingredients that are grown in their own garden. For our main courses, we split the Grilled Pacific Corvina and the Grilled 14 oz. Ribeye. The Corvina was light and mild, and seasoned to perfection. Even my fiancé, who normally doesn't eat seafood, had it and enjoyed it. The chimi-churri rice and baby green beans were perfect accompaniments. The Ribeye was fantastic and perfectly cooked. No need for steak sauce for this one thanks to the delightful cracked pepper demi-galce. The Parmesan au gratin potatoes were out of this world! Finally, as if all this wasn't enough, we just had to try dessert. We chose the Warm Valrhona Chocolate Fondant. And let me tell you, it was awesome! The fondant was decadent and came with vanilla bean ice cream that paired perfectly, topped with fresh berries. The portions on everything was just right and I can't wait to come back to try more items off of the menu. The burgers that I saw the servers carrying past me looked topnotch and I look forward to coming back! Check them out. 5-stars!"}
{"text":"We stayed the Hilton and were given breakfast buffet coupons. The food was tasty for such a small buffet, and it was just a short walk from the hotel. However, the wait staff is high pressure on their tips. They filled the water glasses (one time) and provided a check. A tip for that??"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and consistent. I ate here over 9 times while staying for a conference. I was very surprised to find such quality in a franchise on-site restaurant. They use fresh herbs, and it makes all the difference. The staff is friendly, the outdoor setting is beautiful. The bathrooms are clean. I would highly recommend this restaurant. I went to Elements at Camelback and had the salmon -- sorry to say I paid twice the money for an inferior dish when compared to the salmon at Rico's. The bartender and managers were very friendly. They even comp'd a dish because it took too long and my sister was a little late for the start of the conference."}
{"text":"Rico's Restaurant food is ok.  Service is terrible, we eat out a lot and I mean a lot , this is by far the worst dinning experience I have ever had . To start , the waitress dumped a full glass of water on me , the food came and never got any refills , my daughter had a bug in her drink and when we finished  We waited 25 minutes for the bill and then there was stuff on the bill we didn't order . I recommend if you stay at the point , drive to a nearby restaurant."}
{"text":"Order:
Me-Burger cooked perfect.  Needs something like sauce.
Wife-Pizza wasn't hot/wasn't cold
Daughter-Chicken strips-good flavor over battered though
Son-Mac 'N Cheese.  Said it was good.

Server-was awesome very attentive.  Food a little slow coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"My first experience here was for a Yelp Elite event and I was very impressed. Usually, hotel premise restaurants aren't all that spectacular, but RIco's was really fantastic. Highlights: homemade pretzels with spicy mustard as a bar appetizer, best fish tacos I've ever had, cheesecake strawberry sundaes and an awesome local selection of wines and beers. On top of all this - the staff were super attentive and professional. We're excited to go back for happy hour, which I'm told is ALL day on Saturdays. Win!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this two stars was for the pleasant wait staff and hostess greeting.  Bread came out boiling hit and mushy like it had been microwaved or steamed.  Spread for bread tasted odd.   Ordered a grilled chicken salad.  Chicken might have once been grilled but it was ice cold and therefore tasteless.  The bread on the steak sandwich was again mushy and tough like it had been microwaved.   Awful.  The waitress asked if we would like to see the.manager.  Manager never came so we left without eating.  The waitress was sympathetic.   Now we know why this huge restaurant was empty on a Saturday night.  Only two other tables occupied.  This place was once a very nice restaurant.   What happened?  I see others share our concerns on yelp"}
{"text":"We had a Yelp Event here last year for Christmas & even though we only tried a few preselected items from the menu, prepared buffet style - we enjoyed the food & thought if we lived closer this would be place we would come back to. We did make note of their delicious beer selection & the fact that you can take a growler home is a plus! So... if we're in the neighborhood... we would stop here to enjoy a bite & drink at Rico's!! Thanks for putting on a great event and hope to see you again soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I walked over to Ricos from the Pointe Hilton to order some dinner to take back to our room. The Strawberry and Citrus salad sounded delicious.....it was quite opposite. It was terrible!!! The chicken was bland. The dressing was watered down disgusting yogurt. The lettuce was questionable. This salad needs to be taken off the menu and reformulated. My suggestions: do spinach instead of mixed greens, add some flavor to the chicken and serve a vinaigrette of some sort. Hopefully the rest of the food this restaurant serves is better than this salad."}
{"text":"Rico's has my most favorite Bloody Mary! I am new to the Bloody Mary world and don't care for them terribly spicy. The service was better than average, not great. While sitting outside mid-afternoon, our waiter, being efficient, opened the door and basically yelled, \"you two doing okay?\" we just laughed about it. Really?!?! You can''t actually walk to our table and ask??!!

Their menu is somewhat limited. We were staying at the resort so were somewhat at the mercy of Rico's. Our choice to stay on campus as we didn't want the hustle and bustle of traffic."}
{"text":"Meh. Food was ok. I either expect excellent quality and small portions or average quality and large portions for the price point. Typically a $30 scallop entree would have a better flavor for 3 scallops. Slightly fishy and overcooked. Service was adequate. We had a party of 8. Wouldn't recommend it. If staying at the Hilton, take an Uber to another restaurant vs. the convenience of walking here."}
{"text":"This is seriously some of the worst food that my family has ever eaten.  One item came out STILL FROZEN!  I'm not kidding.  My chicken sandwich was microwaved and rubbery (the whole thing was nuked - even the lettuce was hot) and the sauce tasted like Spaghetti O's sauce poured over the chicken.  Even if it's free don't eat here.  They will entice you when you check in with $20 per day of Hilton coupons to dine at the resort but it's still not worth it.  RUN! - Go somewhere else - this place is awful.  

Apologies to the wait staff - they were very friendly but there is no excuse for food this bad."}
{"text":"I have no idea why anyone has positive things to say about this place. There was not one redeeming quality to this place. We were staying at the Hilton on property and people reccommended this location and the menu looked amazing! The positive things stop there.

The whole experience had a weird vibe to it. This is the type of establishment theater comes across as pretentious. Trying to be gourmet but falling oh so very short. Our server made us feel awkward. Couldn't tell if she was trying to be friendly and helpful or condescending. There was only one other table while we were in there, yet the service was lacking.  Got the chorizo \"fondue\" Which pretty much tasted like cheese wiz with chorizo mixed in. We also got the pumpkin squash soup, which was the best tasting past of the meal. Way too salty though. 

Everyone at the table tried something different And we all met with the same consensus. Super expensive waste of dinner. The tenderloin was  off, like the fat was hard and half of it was super gamey tasting...like maybe it had started going bad. To reiterate that, we fed a couple bites to my dog, who has only thrown up rocks in his lifetime...and he threw up the tenderloin... Coincidence? Between five meals we found nothing any of us were even remotely interested in finishing, even at 24 bucks a pop. 

We were super bummed with this whole experience. Service was not good, food was way overpriced, ambiance was nothing to write home about and nothing was enjoyable to eat. It literally became the joke of the whole trip. Save yourself a ton of money and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Since we moved to 16th street, my husband and I have been meaning to try Rico's.  Tonight, we finally went for dinner.  We were greeted with a friendly and warm welcome by the hostess.  However, it took awhile for our server to greet us.  When he did, he wasn't very personable at all.  We started off with the honey hot wings.  It felt like forever for these to come out.  The sauce was good, but the wings came out in these 2 little buckets.  That was kind of weird, because it makes grabbing the wings more difficult.  Then I ordered the Margherita Flatbread and my husband ordered the Steakhouse Burger.  He got to choose which cheese he wanted and the server wasn't even sure what cheeses they had so he asked a nearby server.  Our entrees were actually out pretty quickly.  However, my husband's burger had the wrong cheese and apparently the burger comes with chips as its side, not fries, which was a little weird.  I did enjoy the Margherita Flatbread.  

The restrooms were really nice and clean.  I liked the atmosphere of the whole restaurant.  We went on a Thursday night and it was pretty dead.  A couple people in the dining area and the rest in the bar section, which is where we sat.  They have a huge patio, which looks ideal for large groups. The menu had very few options.  It was pricey.  We were pretty surprised about the prices.  They do have happy hour though from 3pm-7pm, Monday thru Friday (I believe).  If we do return, it would be most likely during that time or lunch, because as a Yelper, you get a special discount.

A positive note for those who are guests at the Squaw Peak Resort, you can charge the bill to your room."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on our last night of our \"staycation\" at Squaw Peak back in July. I had the meatloaf which was a little too burnt for my taste, but my wife's ribeye tasted pretty good. Pretty fast service although the restaurant was only half full. Our server gave us both the kids-eat-free discount plus the military discount.  Kudos to him, but I forgot his name. My only gripe was the wait to be seated. The hostess told us around 30 min wait because alot of parties had just arrived. She asked us if we wanted to wait. We said yes, obviously. So we sat in the lounge with 2 loud twin 2 yr old boys. 15 min later we were seated. Did I mention the place was half full? Was the hostess hoping we would not hang out and maybe take my kids somewhere else?  Who knows... but they lost a star for that."}
{"text":"Let's face it, if your on the property it's about the only choice in the off season. It's not great, but the food is OK and the staff is generally friendly. Nothing to write home about.  Needs a better selection and the staff could smile more."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here for 3 days over the weekend. We had vouchers for the buffet so my review is limited to that aspect of Rico's. 

The buffet was always stocked and the people running the make to order egg station were always very friendly and made great omelets. The only problem we ran into was on the 2nd and third days our waitress was hard to find. Because it is a buffet I don't expect the greatest service, as I am getting most of my meal, but they do not have coffee out and serve it a cup at a time so when the servers go missing and don't check on the table until the end of the meal it puts quite a damper on what was actually a very good meal."}
{"text":"Long wait, despite having only a few people dining. Horrid tasting food. Waitress had all the charisma of a robo-telemarketer. IMO this was overpriced garbage. This place makes me wish I had gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just ate some of the breakfast food there. Had the eggs Bennie, biggest issue first bite of second half, a big ass hair in the food. Disgusting! To further break it down the potatoes were cold, wife had the chiliaquiles, which was cold, she asked for salsa and got marinara. Usually don't complain on these but STAY AWAY from this dump!"}
{"text":"We came for breakfast and it was pretty good. They do the breakfast for squawk Peak so it was a typical hotel breakfast. The service was good it wasn't too horribly busy whenever we went. Overall it was a good experience just nothing overly special."}
{"text":"A long time friend took me to Rico's.  I was visiting from CA and depended him to choose a nice place for dinner.  Rico's did nothing but impress me.  A nice guitar player on Friday night, a couple of beers and dinner that was very, very good at a killer price.  Impressive"}
{"text":"Not a place I would go back to!  My husband and I ate there while at Squaw Peak Resort.  Soup was great.  I ordered fish tacos which included  two tiny pieces of fish on cold flour tortillas.  My husband had rib steak which was very thin.  We wanted to bring our own wine - 25 dollar corkage, we opted to purchase bottle. They didn't have the wine we ordered so settled for something else.  Squaw Peak Resort was equally dissappointing."}
{"text":"Great food at Rico's! The nachos are great, as is the green chile stew. You can actually make a meal out of either of those appetizers. They're filling and delicious. Decent beer selection--although I'd prefer if they had Four Peaks (Hop Knot) on tap. Sort of a casual/upscale atmosphere. You'll probably feel at ease no matter what you're dressed like. Very helpful and friendly staff. Overall, Rico's is a winner. If I lived closer, I'd visit often."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast buffet on a Sunday morning. The food was either cold or gross, and there was no service. Our waitress was no where to be seen."}
{"text":"The best time to dine here is on a weeknight during happy hour when the weather is favorable for dining on the patio. Happy hour menu offers plenty of food and beverage options that are all pretty tasty. Service is quick and friendly. Outdoor fireplaces and fire pits are spaced around the patio in case you get chilly."}
{"text":"Service is great    On second visit they continue to be friendly. Chopped salad is awesome.  It is tossed at your table and you choose the amount of dressing.  BBQ flatbread and bucket of beer at happy hour is super good. Kids meals worked well for our two kids under 9 years."}
{"text":"First time here from Ohio on business. Had the pub burger. This shop needs some work m. Burger was not quite cooked as ordered soggy bun. Not much on flavor. Sweet potato Fries also soggy and not real warm. Service in bar was slow always bothered by that. Will try someplace else for rest of this trip. The pickle was good!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about Rico's. The food is okay. The atmosphere is okay. The service is okay. The drinks are okay. It's just an okay place.

They have a fire pit on the patio and they are dog friendly. That's a big plus in my opinion because I travel with my dog and she doesn't get to leave the room often.

I've eaten here twice and would return again. Don't expect to come here and be wowed. I have seen nothing that makes me feel like the staff go above and beyond the monotony of the restaurant business. However, I have not been disappointed by the food or service. Rico's is neither excellent or poor, it is just okay."}
{"text":"For a so called high end joint   I have had better nachos at 7-11    The cheese was some processed goo and the chips were so tiny the couldnt anything     I had one of their signature cocktails and it was horrible   Could be that the bartender admitted she didnt drink liquor or that she was following a menu to make it   Would not return even if i stayed at the hotel again    Hope you arr luckier than me if you brave it"}
{"text":"Met some friends here this morning for breakfast. They had the $18 buffet which they've had before and enjoy.
My husband and I ordered the same, cheddar cheese omelettes.  It came with toast and American fries which I normally don't eat and forgot to substitute.  I tasted one, very mushy and not good.  The omelettes were I believe the worst I have ever had.  It was dry, over cooked, hardly any cheese, and basically tasteless.  I asked the waitress if they use real eggs or cartons, she said real egg.  I didn't want to say anything in front of our friends as they eat there all the time and like the buffet.  So I just ate.
I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Appalling. The one star goes solely to an apologetic hostess.

DH and kids got the buffet which they were relatively happy with but no silverware. Waitress verbally acknowledged no silverware but never brought any. I scavenged from other tables.

I ordered a dish. Something with fish. When it arrived I ate a few bites and found a big black hair. Unable to find waitress but DH found the hostess who offered to take it off the bill, which we eventually did.

Fast forward to night- this happened about 30 minutes ago. Somehow the above wasn't enough to scare me off completely- staying on resort makes proximity a redeeming quality when only a few other options exist. Forgot that its Valentines Day - hanging out with the kids - was told 20-25 minute wait. No biggie but we decided to head to the Mexican place down the street. 

Walking through the parking lot my kids were freaking out - \"What is that?\" \"It's a spider!\" Something moving rapidly from the building. It was a cockroach about 1.5\" long. Perhaps they just sprayed insecticide.

These incidents have convinced me that this place has little regard for cleanliness. Won't do it again. Despite staying at the property for a few more days."}
{"text":"Upon arrival had 30 minute wait, not because place was busy, but due to being understaffed. 
Two us tried the breakfast \"bar\". Half the items were empty. Cook was running between omelet station and kitchen, felt bad for him. Food overall was good though once received. Omelette, pancakes, eggs all more than acceptable. Just a typical restaurant run by a huge corporation like Hilton. Do more with less.  Decor was very nice, staff was pleasant. Was not great, but was fine.
$80 two buffets, a bagel and pancakes"}
{"text":"Being the B, L, and D (breakfast, lunch and dinner) restaurant of a major valley resort takes allot of versatility. From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. 

With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. 

In the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. 

A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. 

The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   

Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. 

Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean. 

While Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub."}
{"text":"Came here for a special event. Nice atmosphere, fun events like bunch with Santa, good food (some of the nices I have had in AZ). Entrees weren't stellar but the flatbread pizzas were nice, the pretzles soft and warm, and a delicious caramel bread pudding. I tried the rest of the desserts and was not too impressed but if I friend wanted to go here I would not hesistate."}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner and still not sure exactly how I feel about it. I guess okay would be the best word.

It was not busy. The server was nice and friendly just not very attentive on refills.

The food was good but not great. Biggest complaint was the side basket of jalapeño fries. Unseasoned and so soggy they couldn't even be dipped in the dipping sauce, which was really good. My son had fries from the kids menu and those were better.

Wings I'm sure were baked but good flavor and plating. They would be a hit if crispy.

Risotto was good the tomatoes give it a nice unexpected taste. I do wish the onions were diced smaller."}
{"text":"Woo hoo! I'm a fan of Rico's. For starters: they've got a great happy hour and it runs until 7 so you can realistically hit them up after work without getting a speeding ticket on your way there. Happy hour includes a couple $2 drafts (and other drink specials), as well as, some half price \"appetizers\" which include a jalapeno, bacon, cheese burger. Hello! 

But it's also a great lunch option. It's spacious and you can have a private conversation with your lunch date without being squished up against other diners. Lighter dishes are available BUT remember this spot for when you're craving comfort food and get the kick-A meatloaf sandwich. It's open faced, piled high with onion strings and doused with their kitchen's secret spicy ketchup. WARNING: it's totally cravable!"}
{"text":"RUN NOW!

I absolutely hate writing 1 star reviews but I feel the need to provide a public service announcement and protect the community from this horrible disgusting food.

My wife and I visited this location for lunch after checking into the hotel. I am a diamond member with Hilton so we got these discount slips to use on the property for meals. We decided to try Rico's. I am very very sorry we did this and I would not eat here even if it was 100% free.

Let's begin with the service. We had a server were English is her second language and hard trouble understanding her and she struggled to understand us which is frustrating to say the least. She did not do a good job of following up with us or keeping our drinks filled. Since it was just my wife and I she was more interested in joking around and spending time with the group of 7 she had which was obviously more of a tip for her. The place was near empty and she was frazzled.

We decided to order an appetizer and picked Chorizo Fondue. Fondue is supposed to be served very hot. This was barely warm and congealed quickly making it difficult to eat and ruins the flavor when this happens. The actual taste of the fondue was just ok even when it was luke warm. 

My wife also tried this special seasonal soup Pumpkin Sweet Potato. It was DISGUSTING! This tasted more like a watered down gravy from a can with no smell or even a hint of pumpkin or sweet potato flavor. It's hard to even explain how gross this dish was. We told the server and she took it off the ticket after chastising us how no one else has complained....Really a customer tells you how bad a dish is and you want to argue with us and make use feel like its our fault...thats not good customer service.

I ordered the Pub Burger and was highly disappointed. You know you are in trouble when your server does not even understand what cooked medium means. I had to explain I wanted a nice medium which is pink throughout the patty. She was confused like I asked her to do math. I added bacon to the sandwich and selected onion rings as the side. 

When the burger came out it was a small patty much smaller than the bun was. It seemed like a 4 or 5 ounce patty not even the 8 ounce I would have expected. The burger was unevenly cooked and was a mix of medium and well done. There seasoning was weak and needed to be properly salted. The bacon was not cooked crispy it was some strange flat chewy bacon closer to a jerky style bacon instead of a fresh crispy bacon you expect. The burger was not very juicy and just not an impressive burger. Especially for $14.95 I have had WAY better burger from fast food chains. The onion rings were SO soaked in grease and had the same issue as my wife's sweet potato fries. The oil was clearly not hot enough when they were dropped and it soaked up so much oil. When you pushed on the onion ring or fry it just dripped oil. 

My wife ordered the Three Wagyu Beef Brisket Sliders and did not even finish them. She picked one apart and tried to eat some of it and couldn't. The brisket was mostly fat and not beef. Brisket should have a good mix of both and mostly beef. This was more like 3/4 fat with a little meat. The flavor profile was bland and so under whelming I did not even want to eat it and I love brisket. Her sweet potato fries were bad as previously mentioned.

Lastly this is HIGHLY overpriced food for the quality provided and the lack of service. Just save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. Even if the resort gives you free money to eat there it's not worth the horrible experience which will live with you forever.

The manager was onsite and not once did he even come over to our table and apologize about the food or ask how things were. The manager clearly does not care about his customers and has no control over the kitchen when this type of food is going out. I am shocked how bad this experience was. I was even further disappointed when I informed the front desk at the resort they did nothing to make it right or offer to make it right. Not the Hilton experience I am used too."}
{"text":"My mom and I came in here for some drinks and we shared a plate of mussels.  The mussels were delicious, great sauce, served with jalapeno toast. Acoustic guitar added some nice little ambience to our mother daughter time.  It's a nice spot for a low key evening."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant quite a number of times for various and sundry reasons since it is in a convenient location.    The service and food has been spotty (to say the least!!!) in the past, and I know a new manager and chef was brought on board a few months ago.   I met a client there for drinks, and we ended up having dinner.    I had the Five-Spiced Short Ribs and he had the Cuban Reuben.   The side we ordered on his reuben was the sweet potato fries, since I LOVE sweet potato fries.  Yumm!!   To say my short ribs was delicious is an absolute understatement.    Is there hope for this place??   With this dish I would say 'YES!\"   The meat was melt in one's mouth.   The sauce was what I would consider lickable.   I actually ordered some extra of the sauce and left it on the table and had to go back.   No way was I eating the meat without it!   (Oh, yeah.   Forgot to mention that I took part of my meat home.)   The dish was topped with spinach -- I am assumed steamed and lightly seasoned -- and maybe polenta??   It was sort of a cornmeal dish.   I would have preferred mashed potatoes, but the polenta -- if that's what it is -- was good.   Perfecto accompaniments.   He said his reuben was good.   It was quite thick as far as the bread and meat.   I am not a sandwich eater, and I was enjoying the fries and my meat too much to even care to sample it.   Unfortunately, the dishes, when brought to the table, the fries were cold and so was my meat, signaling to me it had been prepared and not immediately served.   What a shame.   You know that sweet potato fries are ONLY good when eaten right out of the fryer.   And, as I stated, my meat was cold as well.   Service is still a bit on the slow side.   There is hope for the restaurant if they can get it together.   My dish was really tasty.   Let's hope the service will improve."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. Period. Finished my beer before ever getting the waitress to take our food order as she was flirting with customers at the bar. Stay Away."}
{"text":"Ordered the baby kale salad and it was tasty, but I wouldn't classify it as an \"entree salad\" without practically doubling the price to add a meat or fish protein. Service was very slow and had to remind the server for silverware. Too expensive for what you get - not a good value at all. Nice local beer selection - the only reason this wasn't a 1 star rating."}
{"text":"Minus 5 stars. I ordered French toast and it tasted like it had old grease on it like they don't wash their dishes. I asked for home fries and they gave me red Rosemary potatoes that looked like they had been sitting in a buffer for three days. I knew better not to try them. As disgusted as I was I asked for a coffee. They can't mess that up right? Wrong! The coffe tasted like and instant coffee from a cheap motel that had been burned. It was so bitter I just had to leave. No milk or sugar can fix that. This place needs to get checked by the health department"}
{"text":"Steven was my server and truly made this visit one that was extremely memorable. He was attentive, polite and made sure I was well taken care of. I ordered the salmon frittata and it was served with a side of crispy potatoes. The portion was HUGE too! My coffee was always refilled as well as my water which for this Seattle gal is very important (I'm totally not used to 105 degree weather)! 

Servers like Steven are hard to come by and truly are what make dining out such a joy!!! 

Thanks Steven!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very elegantly designed, and the layout of the patio is very nice. Unfortunately the food isn't as good as the architecture of the restaurant.  I was with a group of friends and we ordered the following:

Fried Calamari: Actually really good-it had a hint of lime which was unique and tasty 

Buffalo wings: The spicy buffalo sauce was good but I thought the chicken could have been a bit crispier.

Smoked Fish Taco's: Very disappointing, lacked the smokey flavor they advertised they should have just called it fish tacos.  

They offer pizza which actually looked tastey so maybe next time I am there I will give it a try.  

This place has potential but so far just an A-OK place."}
{"text":"Complete waste of money. Breakfast is the easiest meal to make and they don't have a clue. My bacon was beyond crispy, more like yesterday's news and lucky I didn't chip a tooth. Potatoes were stale and deflated. All the ketchup in the house couldn't make them better. All that and price point is as high as a 4 star restaurant. Don't bother. Lame. Aggravating. Chef needs Gordon Ramsay to slap him around."}
{"text":"Here for dinner with my family.  We were staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort.  Nice location, casual dining.  Good menu with choices.  Service was OK, food fairly well prepared although lamb was overcooked for one of our party.  Overall, OK experience."}
{"text":"An old friend from high school and I were meeting for breakfast.  This time of year is perfect for eating outdoors and this was in the area.  I had never heard of it but I posted what I was looking for in talk and this place came recommended.

Turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.  Open by 7AM on a Saturday, full wait service and a patio that wasn't pushed right up against the sidewalk.

Service and food were both excellent.  Even though it was atteched to a resort it wasn't unreasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love Rico's! We go there for dinner every Christmas Eve, at a minimum. They have good artisan-type American food, and we always enjoy ourselves. Jim took great care of us tonight, and we had a great time. Dad said the carrot cake was some of the best he's ever had."}
{"text":"I is good and very convient.  It's a big room with plenty of seating. I seemed pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Went there only because we wanted an outside table nearby on short notice.  Assumed it would be overpriced and just o.k., since it's on gotel grounds (Hilton Squaw Peak).  SOOO much better than when this place was the Lantana Grill.  My wife and stepmother raved about their fish (halibut & salmon).   My daughter and I had great burgers/fries.  Great microbrew menu.  Service was attentive.  Decent value.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hilton and were tired so decided to go one of the restaurants in the premises. Let's just we left happy. Our server David was friendly and fast. On top of having an excellent server there food was delicious. If we come back up this way i will visit this restaurant. Try there burgers, sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"Attended grand opening. Great fish tacos. Beer flights were a nice beginning  house brew rough rider. Very good. Great service too. Loved it."}
{"text":"This restaurant plays to a semi-captive audience of people staying at the adjoining Pointe Hilton hotel. Food is kind of meh, prices are a bit high, and service is slow. At least the staff are friendly. But for better eats hop in a car and go even a mile or two."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour.  Odd, because it took the better of an unhappy hour to be waited on.  Bartender,  nice guy,  kept telling me he was jammed, but the whole place was less than 1/4 full.  Finally got to order (Happy hour specials, apps and since drinks $5. I orderef 1/2 order of naked wings and a glass of the house cab). Took forever to arrive.  Wings nice and crispy,  but when they say naked,  they mean it. No salt,  no pepper, almost no flavor.  House wine wasn't something I'd order ever again.  Not that I'm coming back here."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Rico's with the entire family and extended family. Our server was very nice to our kids which went noticed.   Very good food and I highly recommend the red smoothie.  Don't get scared by the beets."}
{"text":"I had the American burger with a tasty IPA. Watch out the Jalapenos are HOT! Great meal, great price."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on one occasion while staying at the Hilton Resort next door. I got here for breakfast pretty early, around 7:30 am, and it was kinda slow which was good. We were seated rather quickly and our server was really kind and greeted us with a smile. We placed our breakfast and we got our food rather quickly. The food itself was nothing special but it was still pretty good. I didn't get a chance to go back any other time, nor for dinner, so I can't base my review on that, but the place is nice. Especially when you get to sit outside in those lovely Arizona nights. Definitely check this place out if you are staying at the resort!"}
{"text":"Food sucks; place is dirty; waited 45 mins for eggs, bacon, toast. Dirty patio and tables. Has potential but needs better management"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for Valentine's dinner with a reservation made through opentable.com, we were very excited as this was going to be our first night out since having our little boy in late December. We used to work at this place back when it was Lantana Grill almost 8yrs ago, in fact this is where we met each other. She was a server and I was in room service for the resort, both share the same kitchen. So this night out meant a lot to us in many ways. 

When we arrived to our surprise the reservation was worth nothing because they weren't even open for dinner at the time opentable allowed for our reservation. So the host who was eating a sucker/lolly pop pointed us into the bar area for \"dinner\". Our server/bartender was a middle aged woman/human tornado running around the place in circles. Service was horrible. There were multiple staff members available and no one helped her or us. Seemed like they enjoyed watching her drown with her seemingly overwhelming 4 tables (9ppl), this was obvious from the laughs heard behind her back when she would leave the bar. The \"teamwork\" was awful, and from what I know about Hilton this should not be tolerated. From simple appetizers taking over 40min, sighs from our server when we asked for water and another sigh from the woman who brought out our food when we asked her to take our dirty plates that I had conveniently stacked to make easier I was throughly disgusted by the entire experience. We paid our tab and got out of there as fast as we could.  In fact we actually left and went somewhere else to get dessert and drinks to continue the night at a place where we felt welcome. We live local and will continue to steer people clear of this place. Every possible customer should skip this place and just go to Z-Tejas just a mile down the road.

If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Man was I ever disappointed in Rico's. My sister and I had a staycation and stayed at the Pointe, in the morning I suggested we walk over to Rico's. I had been to Rico's once before when Yelp hosted a Christmas party there and the food was sooo tasty so I KNEW the food would be good.

However, this was not the case. The food that came out was extremely beautiful! Plated very nice and we couldn't wait to jump in. I had the Lemony griddle cakes with blueberry compote. The griddle cake had ZERO trace of lemon flavor at all, with a description like \"lemony\" I was expecting a flavor burst, also they were very spongy and dry. My sister got the rum raisin french toast, again there really wasn't much flavor to it. We were both very disappointed in our breakfasts and for the price it just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Well... the food was good but it took longer than 30 minutes for it to arrive.. it was 5 of us and only 2 other tables...they were both served long before us so the 30 plus minute wait was a bit too much for 4 burgers and a salad.. needless to say, we won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"Rico's is so much fun!

I went and caught the tail end of happy hour in the lounge area. Happy hour is 4-7! The bartender was super friendly and checked to see if we were able to watch a baseball game that was not a local team. 

After a couple $5 glasses of wine and some delicious calamari, I headed up to the main dining room. I shared a bottle of wine, pizza, and salad with my sister. Everything was delicious, fresh, and super flavorful! The margarita pizza was as tasty as the pizza I had last summer in Italy! 

We had the most amazing server in the main dining room. David was very good with wine recommendations and very knowledgeable with the menu.  He was very attentive, but not too overbearing.  My sister and I had a wonderful dinner and would totally go back."}
{"text":"- Service was excellent
- Great breeze on the outdoor patio (thanks mother nature)
- Fish tacos are killer; fish is grilled and smoky; shredded red cabbage nice touch; fresh salsa with jalepenos kicked it up a notch; black beans and bacon side was smoky goodness
- Margherita flat bread was yummy
- Ricos Greens salad - would have it again
- Wine list had great values and recommend the  Night Harvest Sauvignon Blanc
- No room for dessert - next time"}
{"text":"Wait staff was friendly enough, but the food for the money was awful. Hamburger dry and salads just some lettuce. Way over priced. I feel I was ripped off! Don't go!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, decent prices for the quality (entrées were between $13 and $23). I had the rib eye and my husband the NY strip. They were both delicious and the sides creative and tasty! Good beer selection, wait staff was friendly, overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The waiter was nice and professional.  Drink refills were a little slow and the place was only 25% full on a Saturday night.  The appetizer was good but the main course (Steakburger) was terrible.  I couldn't put enough A1 Sauce on it to quench this burger's thirst.  The fries were cold and soggy.  The kids liked it because the waiter brought them chocolate chip cookies at the end."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The waitress was funny and personable and the food was great. My husband and I had the pub burger which was incredible. Our granddaughters had a burger and pasta and meatballs which were both very good. It was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. 

Came in for breakfast since it is at our hotel (convenient) and was one of a few places that could easily accommodate our very large party (12 adults, 7 kids). I wasn't expecting much, since most of the reviews are middle of the road, but still left feeling a little underwhelmed.

Service was good and I appreciate that our server was able to handle such a large group without our drinks being empty and plates quickly bussed. 

The food was just so-so. We had both orders off their menu and a few who opted for the breakfast buffet. 

The buffet was large - yogurt station, fruit, cereal, made to order omelets, French toast, pancakes, potatoes, eggs, bacon & sausage, assorted pastries. 

I had a made to order omelet and it was pretty greasy - way too much cooking oil used. The pastries were alright, potatoes were good. The juice station didn't have OJ(?). It was kind of your standard, sub-par breakfast buffet. But the price seemed way too high ($16.95); I feel like $12.95 would have been a little more appropriate. I did appreciate that kids under 5 were free for the buffet. Helps balance the higher cost of the adults I suppose. 

My husband ordered the Nutella French toast and it was good, my mom had the pineapple pancakes and didn't eat more than 1 because they weren't very good, and the eggs Benedict my dad ordered was just okay."}
{"text":"Breakfast is ok, our burger for lunch was delicious!! We enjoyed our waitress, Gracey ( grace) . She was very attentive, adorable and super nurturing to my husband and I. You can tell she takes pride in her work and works hard!!"}
{"text":"Rico's American Grill in the truest sense of the word: delicious, fresh, unpretentious, impressive and friendly. I attended a yelp event last night and was truly pleased with the food and service here. I've tried most of the dishes on the menu and everything tasted great. I am definitely coming back here to have brunch with my Mom when I get back from New York. I was also very impressed with the Manager and the rest of the staff. They were all very professional and made sure we were happy with the service and our food. They were happy to explain how they cook their dishes and how everything is freshly prepared everyday. We even met their chef. A great place to drop into to have a great meal and leave happy."}
{"text":"We had the most delightful server!  Two wonderful salads and a sandwich would have been ordinary if not for Andrea. Happy Easter !"}
{"text":"I have visited Rico's before and now live in the area. My girlfriend and I walked there Friday night thinking a casual drink and a snack might end the week well. Boy were we wrong. Slow and disheveled bar staff, beer coolers behind the bar that are streaked with God knows what and show no recent signs of cleaning. A sticky bar top was the last straw. After one drink and having to send up s flare to get my bill we left and walked across the street for a nice meal.  As a Hilton Diamond  I find this place totally unacceptable for a resort of this type and intend to make this known to Hilton. Avoid this place until they fix it up!!"}
{"text":"Based on the questionable reviews of this and the other restaurant at Hilton Squaw Peak Resort, we almost went elsewhere but I'm glad we gave it a shot. The service was top notch (thanks, David) and the food was excellent. I had the flatiron steak which was perfectly cooked to order and accompanied by some delicious blue cheese, onion and bacon stuffed potato skins. My wife had the fish tacos which she loved. The recommended accompanying wine was spot on too.  The place was deserted when we arrived, which gave me pause, but I expect some of the poor reviews may have had a chilling effect on the crowds. I'm writing this review because it is clear that the staff is doing its best to ensure superb service and excellent food.  I wouldn't hesitate to dine at Rico's again!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant right on the resort. Very beautiful interior with ample seating indoors & outdoors. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. The menu was stocked with many options,  at very reasonable prices. I especially enjoyed the water that was brought to our table in its own decanter."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. I stayed at the Hilton next door. I don't know about lunch or dinner but the breakfast is worth it."}
{"text":"Making the rounds after our conference! First time here, had the calamari, seafood cocktail and drinks! Service was very prompt and friendly!"}
{"text":"Rico's does brunch!

Took my man out last Sunday to enjoy the beautiful afternoon. We chose Rico's because I remembered they have a nice outdoor patio with lots of trees and a big fountain out front. 

Brunch at Rico's did not disappoint. I opted for the $15 buffet, sure a tad pricey for a booze free brunch, but trust me I ate my monies worth. The buffet included potatoes, bacon or sausage, chilaquilies, French toast, pancakes, oatmeal, fruit, scrumptious pastries and muffins. It also had a make your own omelet station and a beverage station with coffee, tea and juice. 

My omelet was excellent and the buffet was well stocked. We sat outside and the service was on par. While this may be a little bit more expensive than a normal brunch spot it is a nice \"once in a while\" indulgence."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Prices are not too hefty, but they're not cheap either. We ate here twice during our stay and we would come back again if we were ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Staying at Hilton Squaw Peak - so got the breakfast deal.   The buffet is good, really good, and I strongly dislike breakfast and buffets.   Fresh juice, made to order omelette, even the yogurt was good ;).  Glad I paid for this deal."}
{"text":"We ate at Rico's for dinner on Sunday night.  By far the worst service we have ever had.  From the surly hostess to having to ask the waitress for our drink orders.  Food service was extremely slow.  Waitress even messed up the food order.  It was recommended by the concierge at the Pointe Hilton.  He should be ashamed for recommending it."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by this restaurant.  It was pricey, and so not worth it on the quality/tastefullness aspect. 

I had the grilled corn tortilla soup, which was actually quite pleasing and the restaurant's only redeeming quality. Hence, the two stars.

However, the greens salad was not. I asked for the addition of medium rare steak, and it was more medium well to well done. The salad had no taste, I actually had to use the salt! 

I'm staying at the Hilton and truly feel there should be better options for guests."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is due to Conor! He saved the day. So my friends and I were doing a staycation at the hotel and we came here for dinner. Our waitress basically ignored us while Conor and David brought us the most amazing bread and water. Then she comes back to tell us they are out of the steak we ordered. Conor came around and said he was pretty sure there was some left. Well....there was. So basically he made a great meal happen. Thank you Conor!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for their Christmas buffet dinner yesterday and had a wonderful time...the food and service were outstanding, and the ambience made for a very special Christmas feast.  I would love to do it again next year!  thank you thank you thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Over-priced and poorly executed food. Ordered the vegetable risotto. It was the worst risotto I've ever been served. It was basically tomato soup with under-cooked risotto floating in it. The server did offer to bring something else, so I got the baked mac and cheese. It was better than the risotto but still not what you'd expect for the price-point."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in restaurant and it has been 10 minutes sitting at our table and still have not seen our waiter to even take our drink order."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!!!!! Don't even bother. !!!!!!   I am serious the service was horrible, the food wasn't that good and don't even get me started about the price !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were underwhelmed by Rico's. Drive past it multiple times since we live right up the street. We did a staycation at the Pointe and had complimentary breakfast there, which was good. Our waitress was a sweet lady. The breakfast buffet had fresh eggs for omelettes, which was nice. Everything else didn't wow us. The package we had included dinner for two, so on the same day we went back. A lot of staff just standing around doing nothing while one guy was taking the 3 tables. He was nice, but wasn't at our table very often because he was busy with not much help. The food was ok, at best. My boyfriend's porkchop was undercooked to what he would have liked it to be so he only ate half. The chocolate flourless whatever it was dessert was such huge disappointment.


 The thing that really bothered us was the executive chef standing at the bar at the side very obviously flirting with a bartender who was standing around doing nothing. For the ENTIRE time. It seemed very unprofessional. A table right next to us wanted to speak with the executive chef so they called him by name, very loudly, at least 8 times, and he was so engrossed with his flirting he didn't even look up.

I don't think we will ever return. 

The two stars are only for for staff that actually did things because they seemed like nice people."}
{"text":"We ate here twice. The first time the breakfast was very good so we decided to go back. The second time they obviously had a different cook. The potatoes and the eggs were no where near as good as the first day. We won't be going back since the food is so hit or miss on the quality."}
{"text":"Had an AMAZING experience here thanks to Leanne. She anticipated our needs and made our dining experience flawless. We all left happy and ready to take on more swimming. Thank you, Leanne!! The food was pretty good... Chorizo Fondue was the winner of the lunch."}
{"text":"My bf and I celebrated our first valentine's day together at Rico's and we had the most amazing meal and best service. If you go please ask for David, he is excellent! Our meal kept getting better and better with each bite. The good food and hospitality is well worth the experience!"}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant a couple of minutes late for breakfast and they accommodated us anyway.  They even took 20% off the check and offered to make us omelets.  Great staff, attentive and kind.  Interesting food, pretty buffet and great coffee.  Champagne was not as bubbly as the server wanted it to be, she brought another glass without even asking if it was unsatisfactory. Kudos to the well trained staff.  Hostess very kind too."}
{"text":"We were a little hesitant to go here for dinner based on the reviews, but we were staying at the Hilton and didn't feel like driving around to go out. Glad we gave it a shot. Our waitress was great and very personable. We have three young kids, so any time wait staff gets how to work with kids out to dinner it's a plus for us. The food was actually really good. My wife and I had burgers and sweet potato fries. The prices were a little on the high side, but not outlandish for what you got. We wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Expensive but VERY tasty breakfast buffet. Debbie was our server, but I felt she was cold - she was overly direct in her communication style and lacked warmth (which I expect from all servers). I used to be a server, and have admittedly high expectations for service. She abruptly asked  (almost barked) for breakfast vouchers \"if we had them...\" for all she knew we were locals.  She did the thing where you hurriedly hold your hand out and bend your fingers as if to say \"gimme, hurry.\" The problem was we had a stack of $10 vouchers, and didn't know the total. We asked for the amount and she said \"I don't know,\" almost annoyed. We had to tell her, ok... So go give us the total... She then tallied it up and told us the total over the railing. It was weird, and rude! 

I am convinced she pegged us as resort guests from the start, which we were, and just expected vouchers and an insufficient tip. We tipped her the full/standard amount on the total (pre-voucher price), but had she smiled, slowed down and showed some warmth, it would have made a huge difference and I MAY have given this 4-5 stars on Yelp. However, most of the overall experience when dining out is the service. As such, Rico's is left with a 3-star-rating from me. It's important to note we were one of three tables at 9:15am on a weekday - so it's not like she was in the weeds. I will add, to her credit, we lingered after paying and she checked back with us - and we asked for to-go cups for coffee, which she obliged. 

So... Let's talk about the details of the restaurant and the food. This is on the edge of The Squaw Peak Hilton Resort, and it's actually a mid-tier modern Mexican restaurant. It's nicely appointed and we were promptly greeted and seated by a nice young man. The menu was limited but had great options! Most entrees are $13, plus coffee and drinks are $3/each, while the buffet is just under $17. So if you get a drink, you may as well get the buffet because it includes your drinks. 

The buffet was nicely laid out with great FRESH fruit, yogurts, cottage cheese, etc. they have fresh squeezed juices, and cereal. Across from that there is an omelet station with a friendly omelet chef (not sure what else to call him.) I ordered an egg white omelet with veggies and very light oil, and asked for light cheese. He was great in accommodating my requests - sadly I had several pieces of egg shell, but spit them out and it wasn't a huge deal. I sort of appreciate knowing it was made with real eggs - but would naturally prefer no shells... 

They have hot syrup, fresh fluffy pancakes, crispy bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, potatoes, etc. All of it frankly was fresh and perfectly prepared. They had the most incredible oatmeal - it had all kinds of stuff in it (oats, grains, quinoa, etc.). Add some honey, brown sugar and golden raisins and it's perfect! Oddly, it was SUPER tasty (I'm not usually an oatmeal person). They serve tasty Starbucks coffee - which I loved. Just check your cup... My first cup had a solid teaspoon of grains at the bottom! I dumped it in my water glass before she refilled me and it was fine after that. Then, there's the pastry station - yum! Super high quality and tasty muffins, croissants, and other carb-a-licious treats (plus fruit preserves). One person in our party had the eggs Benedict, and it was frankly delicious! 
 
Net, breakfast breakfast was great (but pricy at nearly $17/pp), and our server was attentive/took great care of us, but wasn't welcoming/warm. The advice I would give Debbie is to simply smile, slow down, and exude some warmth and compassion. It would make for a better experience and probably increase her tips.

If my review and photos were helpful, please let me know with the voting buttons... It encourages me to take the time to write these reviews."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Came here for breakfast because it is on the hotel grounds. Ordered the eggs Benedict, came out with burnt English muffin, a tiny lunch deli meat piece of ham, and an over cooked poached egg, with about a teaspoon of hollandaise sauce. When I asked for more hollandaise sauce I was told the chef was making more? Ummm strange for a place with eggs Benedict on the menu to run out of hollandaise at 9:00am? And on top of that, the staff was beyond rude, especially the woman running around who looked like the manager who acted like we completed inconvenienced her for asking for a knife. I'm super upset that we have spent so much money on this resort and it has been such a disappointment. Wish we had chosen the Arizona grand resort instead :("}
{"text":"Our group of 8 went to Rico's during s conference lunch break.
They saw we were from the conference and seated us quickly, took and prepared our orders quickly and had no problem separating our checks and having them ready for us, again, quickly. The service was great!

As for the food .. we had some 'meh' reactions. Feedback from the group: the medium burger was a little too well done, the beet salad had a sparse amount of beets and the addition of salmon to two salads was also on the sparse side of things and other dishes were 'okay'

Overall this is a good option if you need somewhere close to the Hilton and only have one hour but I wouldn't go out of my way for the food."}
{"text":"Top notch! Had a wonderful tomato risotto last night and service with Brooklin was great! Nutella stuffed French toast this morning accompanied by the most crispy bacon perfection ever known to man. The one and Only thing better than the food was the impeccable service from Andrea! Loved everything so far. Thanks Rico's!"}
{"text":"As usual the Hilton buffet is great as ever. Wonderful staff and very accommodating.  We came in the wrong entrance, no big deal.  Something definitely for everyone and well worth the price to walk on over than just order room service! 

Eggs made to order and bacon cooked perfectly! Lots of healthy selections too!"}
{"text":"When we arrived, there was a large wait for breakfast with a 30-40 minute wait. I initially thought that meant it was good. When we seated 35 minutes later, I noticed that several tables were empty which only meant they were short staffed. Our waiter was friendly but clearly over worked. I went to get my food and they were out of the French toast, all of the fruit and every dish was dirty! The juice station also had no clean glasses. We told the waiter but it didn't improve by the time we left. AND of course we were charged resort pricing for bummer food and service. Bravo Hilton, we will never come back. Clearly this was the cause of poor management."}
{"text":"We went here 3 times on our recent stay at the Hilton Squaw Peak. Every time we had excellent service. The sandwiches portions are very generous."}
{"text":"- Service was excellent
- Indoor and outdoor seating.
- Fish tacos are killer; fish is grilled and smoky; shredded red cabbage nice touch; fresh salsa with jalepenos kicked it up a notch; black beans and bacon side was smoky goodness
- Margherita flat bread was yummy
- Ricos Greens salad - would have it again
- Pretty decent wine and beer list
- No room for dessert - next time!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hilton and tried to eat here for breakfast at 9am on a Sunday
The parking lot was empty place appeared empty and there was a 30-35 min wait
Hire some staff!"}
{"text":"Not really sure why there are so many bad reviews on yelp about this place...I found it impeccable both times I've been here for lunch, making me want to stop by again, and maybe try their breakfast too. First time I had Grace, second time Zach. Staff is really friendly and welcoming, menu is variegated. I wanted to get their tenderloin steak but I was warned it was pretty small so I ended up having their rib eye, cooked to perfection, juicy and tasty. It was paired with crispy roasted potatoes and green beans, a perfect meal to go with an ordinary day. The location is also wonderful, just a few feet from the lobby of the Hilton!!!"}
{"text":"Just arrived in Phoenix and straight to Hilton Squaw Peak. Went over to have breakfast. Was told there was a 20-30 min. Wait.........But, There where empty tables everywhere and it was a breakfast buffet. Just needed a table and I would serve myself. Couldn't figure this one out. Went somewhere else. Sorry I had to leave a negative review."}
{"text":"After the reunion, we decided to have breakfast together and go our separate ways. We walked in and it was a cute place. We saw some omelet station action going on too. There were 2 hosts, both very nice and we got promptly seated. Then....we waited again for 10 minutes. So, i go to the host stand and ask if we have a server? Then, it happened.....a server was sitting in the waiting area and she rolled her eyes, let out a big huff, threw her arms up and stormed away! Uh...ok....wtf was that display? She proceeded to go in the kitchen and we saw more flailing arms and huffing then our server ran right over. Grace was her name and she was very sweet. Flustered because of that other server but got our order right away. I had eggs benedict and they were delicious. I loved the savory bread pudding as a vessel. The friends had similar meals and all was right. Everyone agreed that their food was just lukewarm, too. Even the hot tea and coffee weren't that hot. It's mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Grilled Chicken salad is very good. Wait staff is knowledgeable about the me us and friendly. Would go back again"}
{"text":"Notionally this is the core restaurant at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak, despite the fact that it's in a separate building and something of a walk.  Dingy, crowded interior.  25-minute line for brunch at 10:00 AM on a Sunday.  A pretty limited brunch buffet saved only by the egg station. 

We got free coupons to eat here that came with our room for a hockey tournament. It was worth the price we paid.  Avoid in the first place.  And never wait in line 30 minutes to eat here."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast.  Enjoyed being able to choose my own ingredients for the omlette.. roasted asparagus and other interesting ingriedients were excellent.  Also fresh grapefruit juice and unlimited coffee was great. Staff was friendly and good on refills. Definitely great place to visit."}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the pointe and went to Rico's for a birthday dinner. We had David as a server he was fantastic. Personable, attentive, prompt, overall we had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend the Pasta Del Mar it was delicious and the kiddos liked that a cookie came with the kids meal. 

We were not impressed with the hostess she wasn't very friendly but everyone else throughout the evening was excellent."}
{"text":"I came here for a business meeting on a Tuesday morning. The breakfast buffet was good and the service was great. The most impressive part was the exterior appearance. They have dozens of different flower varieties circling the buidling. They were all blooming and it great to enjoy a cool spring day in phoenix."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, if you are dining out and spending $18 on an omelet it should be better than what you can make yourself. Our server was kind, but the omelet had a piece of cheddar 1/3rd of the way melted, came with frozen, then fried potatoes with zero creativity and chicken sausage cold in the middle with no opportunity to ever tell our server because she never checked back."}
{"text":"Great food. The staff was friendly and prompt. We had the short rib and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Nice hard boiled eggs. But they were supposed to be poached. Very disappointed. Decent breakfast but I suppose I should have had the buffet."}
