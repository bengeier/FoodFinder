{"text":"Sometime will go there! Food AOK but service NO. Especially the old man, always no smile and unwilling to serve customer . Today I order s wonton noodle, the good Chinese egg noodle are tender but today are very soft very bad! Also the noodle have a small insert , that scary me."}
{"text":"We got extra charges on our bill without notifying us in advance. A no go for sure. Quality is just so so."}
{"text":"I've been going here for about four years now. Not a very thorough review of the place since I usually order the same things every now and then. I can say that the deep fried tofu is a little on the dry side. I prefer deep fried tofu done like at an all you can eat Japanese restaurant, but this isn't one.  I usually order the Hong Kong-style ice lemon tea along with the crispy chicken over fried rice with Portuguese sauce topped with a fried egg. It's a great dish that I always seem to default to.   Their curry fish balls are standard, but nonetheless they're one of my favorites.  I've also had their chicken fried rice several times, I've been pleased with that dish as well.  I'll definitely be returning here again.  I've been told there's another Kenny's restaurant on Steeles but I've yet to try it. If it's anything as good as this one, then I'll surely check it out in the future."}
{"text":"My family favors this restaurant whenever we are up in Richmond Hill. In fact we became friends with the waiters. (Tall guy with glasses) haha  These are one of the last Kenny's gourmet still opened, and it is safe to say that this one gets quite a lot of business. I think because something about this restaurant makes their food so tasteful and the environment is very modern and clean.  Most people might say this is your typical standard Chinese food.. Which is true, but all Chinese restaurants these days taste the same. It really depends which one you have a bias towards.  In fact, they do have a lot of food that you will not see in many other typical Chinese restaurants. They have spaghetti mixed in ketchup and steak and such. They also offer 'Happy Hour'."}
{"text":"When looking for quick HK style meals, there's always a Kenny's.  Kenny's Noodle, Kenny's Place, Kenny's Delight, ... One of my favorite Kenny's is located a bit more north... Kenny's Gourmet.  This food here is cheap and tasty. They have lunch specials, the menu is big, and the portions are filling. The restaurant is clean, bright, and I rarely have to wait for a table.  Decent HK style tea is always a bonus.  I tend to order typical baked rice dishes - black pepper chicken is good here. As for fried rices, the soft shell crab fried rice has tasty bits of crab. A small selection of Chinese desserts is available too.  If you want a casual lunch or dinner this is a great spot. Cheap, large portions, tasty, and consistent."}
{"text":"I've been coming for lunch here for the past 5-6 years. The food is good (tho the general Tao chicken doesn't taste as good as it once did). The service is usually quick at lunch. We order a few dishes to share and they generally start coming out after about 5-10 minutes from ordering. Great if you're in a hurry during lunch. Lunch specials come with a hot drink."}
{"text":"The cleanliness of the place is questionable.  There's a difference between small&cozy and dinky&dirty. If they were cleaner I'd come here all the time because the food is good, but I'm nervous that I'll get sick from eating here..."}
{"text":"This is my first review so I feel like being a little more generous than most of the other Dukes and Duchesses who have only given 3 stars.  These are the Facts...Kenny's is your standard HK style restaurant with your standard HK style hit / miss service and the typical eclectic / odd decore.  Lucky for me I don't come here expecting 5 star service as the food is reasonably priced and most of the items I have tried on the menu have not disappointed.  The one dish that does deserve a 5 star rating however is Kenny's signature General Tsao chicken, which has a unique honey sweetness and packs a little bit of a crunch.  A  must try if visiting or considering take out....Watch out for the green hot peppers in the General Tsao chicken however...they are just as spicy on the entry as they are on the exit!"}
{"text":"This is  a review a couple of months back. The food here is not fresh or tasty. It's the most lazy ass cooking there is. I order toasted thick bread with peanut butter and condense milk and they did not toast the bread they slap on the peanut butter and milk and the whole thing looks gross! Of course I return it telling them \"how can I eat this? it's hard and cold!\". If you have had this bread before you should know the milk on top should be a little burnt and crusty  almost looking like a cheese pizza and really Hot!. I think it was like $3.99 for that toast. I also got the mapo tofu, spelling might be wrong. The mince pork in mapo  tasted like nothing, it was very bland and smell funny. I would never return here again even if it's free! It's really nasty."}
{"text":"When I say I love sandwiches, I LOVE them. I'd choose sandwiches over rice, any day. But there's something about the club sandwiches here that doesn't make it taste so good. I'm not saying the sandwich is bad.. It's still good, just not good enough. I didn't realize there was the addition of fried chicken in it, so every bite was a bit of chicken. Not a fan of it, not at all. I'd prefer the sandwich to have egg, ham, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and mayo.. Maybe it's just me, but the chicken wasn't crispy enough.. Not like bacon.  Exercise.. Ex-ar-size. Eggs are sides.. For bacon."}
{"text":"More of a smaller place, but the food is still really good. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I visited Kenny's with some friend to eat lunch on a Saturday.  We arrived there after 2:30pm in the afternoon (and thus were eligible for their afternoon tea menu).  I was disappointed to learn that the prices for this place has gone up recently.  It is more expensive now in 2015 than it was last year.    I ordered a noodle soup with sliced beef and fish balls.  The soup was tasty and the meat, flavoring and fish balls were all flavorful.  Kenny's remains a competitive restaurant in my books and I like how they offer you a complimentary drink during their afternoon tea time.  For me, the quality of food at Kenny's has always been good (though not exceptional).  They lost some brownie points (and possibly half a star) for raising their prices but I would still go back to eat here once in a while.  Decent quality food and acceptable service leaves this eatery with the standard rating.  3.0/5.0"}
{"text":"We were 7 for Canada Day Supper at Kenny's Gourmet. We had previously been there, and had enjoyed it enough to come back.  The meal is always accompanied by great green tea. We then ordered a Hot and Sour Soup for the table. This was piping hot, tasty, and filling.  We then all shared the following:  Crispy Beef General Tsao Chicken Sweet and Sour Chicken (one of the dinners was younger and wanted something with little or no spice) Large Shrimp with fried rice, garlic and egg white 3 steamed rices  This was followed by an assortment of desserts, which included a mango and pear pudding, some whole sweet milk based 'marshmallow squares, milk pudding with ginger (hot), and a red bean pudding dessert.  We also ordered but never got Deep Fried Crispy Squid. We were unable to verify if the item had been charged for as the whole bill was in chinese.  All the items are well prepared, quickly and professionally served, and are generally appealing. There was no 'wow' moment in the meal with the possible exception of the dessert with ginger. It was good, hot and filling.  In terms of cost it turned out to be less than $25.00/person, including soft drinks for a couple of the dinners.  Its a reliable place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this casual restaurant for traditional HK dishes. Reasonable prices. Standouts were the claypot rice dish and a small hot pot dish,, but other dishes were good too (including preserved vegetable with pork belly, fish skin appetizer)."}
{"text":"This Kenny's Gourmet at Leslie/Major Mac and the Kenny's Noodle at Steeles/Silver Star are the last two Kenny's left.  Cheap, Tasty and Reasonable priced are the main reason that I love going to Kenny's.  Service is always a hit and miss... just be persistent and eventually I get what I want.  Hope it will be around for awhile... I always enjoy their Big Bowl Noodle!"}
