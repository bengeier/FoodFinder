{"text":"THE BEST BREAKFAST YOU'LL EVER EAT!  The eggs Benedict are absolutely the best I've ever had. The owner himself comes out to greet you and make sure you are having a good experience.  Service = Courteous and fast Quality of food = Top notch Ambiance = As breakfast, as breakfast comes; Colourful and bright.  I will go back as often as I can."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé ce restaurant. J'y ai été deux fois en matinée durant la semaine. Parfois quand je veux un déjeuner tranquille, j'aime avoir un environment relax (et différent de allo mon coco qui est souvent pleins). C'était parfait.  Il offre une bonne portion et beaucoup de fruits avec les oeufs benedictines. Leurs patates sont bonnes. Ils laissent aussi un carafe de café que l'on peut se servir nous même à table. Le service était très bien."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant peut facilement être sous estimé à première vue. Mais le menu offre un très bon choix. Les portions sont très bonnes. La nourriture est très bonne. Le service est parfait. Le décor pourrait être amélioré mais ça ne change pas grand chose à l'appréciation général. Mon seul point négatif serait le choix de musique extrêmement désagréable (radio avec musique commerciale qu'on a beaucoup trop entendu). Ils pourraient favoriser une musique plus locale (artistes du Québec) ou jazz léger ou tout simplement ambiante instrumentale."}
{"text":"A solid breakfast joint with lots of options to be had. I went for a full breakfast that came with eggs, French toast, pancake, bacon, sausages and toast. Everything was excellent except perhaps the sausages which were average. The place is warmly lit, pretty and quite roomy, which is a nice change to some other breakfast joints that are too packed in.   Service was quick and efficient with only a major hiccup at the start when the hostess informed us that we'd have to wait for an hour for our table of 6 with no one else waiting in line and plenty of seating to be had albeit on smaller tables. They could have easily moved a table of patrons into one of the available booths (or nearby table) to accommodate us... but for some reason they made us wait 20+ minutes while other patrons that came in groups of 2 and 4 got to immediately sit down... at times the groups of 2 sat down in tables of 4. Not very efficient!!!   I'm sure if you nicely asked patrons to move to a booth from a table, they'd take that one, especially with some TLC and incentives. For that I'll have to dock 1 star from my review."}
{"text":"I went to \" Grille Pain \" on a Sunday Morning for breakfast with my boyfriend . It was our first experience at this restaurant located 5 mins  from our home.   We were well welcomed by a friendly Host and seated at a table of our chosing.   The menu had different choices ( vegetarien  and healthy meals) .  We both had \"La folie\" from the menu with extra sausages as well as a smoothie each .  The food was well prepared and beautifully presented with fruits as garnishment.   Both mango and strawberry smoothies were tasty and not too sweet.  The waffle was my favorite! It arrived at tge table still hot served with fresh starwberries and banana . topped with Nutella and English cream ! DELICIOUS !   the bill came up to 56$ plus taxes and tip.  I gave a 4 star due to the lack of attention provided from our actual waitress.  Unfortunatelly , she didn't share the same work ethic nor enthuasim as her other co workers ."}
