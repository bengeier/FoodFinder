{"text":"Maria's is a Lakewood classic; great Italian food with a nice family atmosphere. The servers are friendly and the wait for a table is generally not bad at all.

The have a full bar and a menu with all types of entr√©es from all regions of Italy. I've never had a dish I didn't like and they serve everything with their homemade cucina bread which is outstanding. And don't forget to pick up dessert!"}
{"text":"It's been a over a year since my last dining experience at Maria's Roman Room.  The menu has changed, yet one can still find the old classics like the delicious chicken marsala w/ fettucine alfredo and eggplant parmesian.  I am tres happy to report that the menu changes also reflect a fresher lighter fare, such as the salmon with white wine and capers that I ordered that was pleasing to the eye as well as delictable.  The menu also posted a couple of other seafood choices served over fresh pasta.  I was truly torn as to what to order, being a rabid fish/seafood predator, ( I have to admit the Jeremy Pivens mercury poision hospitalization had me a bit worried since sushi and I really get along).   My  meal combined with the house Chianti (yes Chianti with salmon you white wine snobs), is in my view a highly recommended Bon Appeit experience!  P.s  The service was decent considering the holiday crowd. The prices for entrees ranged from $13-$25.  A great dining experience and bargain that one must enjoy!"}

{"text":"They refer to themselves as \"The Little Italy of Lakewood\" and I think that's pretty accurate.  It has that old Italian restaurant charm, and the food was the real deal - I got a custom made pasta bowl of fettucine alfredo with red and green peppers.  My friends got pizza which looked fantastic.  I definitely wouldn't mind returning here soon!"}
{"text":"Reading the paper sometimes can be dangerous.

I used to have a fondness for the Cleveland Plain Dealer simply because the paper in Toledo sucks canal water. Fridays, the PD has a section on restaurants and what to do in Cleveland. I never knew there was so much to do, and it was through this I learned of Maria's

I have a buddy Jac, who is always up for a road trip. I told him about this place and the next thing we know were headed down the turnpike toward Cleveland. Jac is a cabbie, like me, but he was also my dispatcher. He doesnt drive like I do. He drives like an old lady on drugs. Slow doesnt begin to describe his style. So here I am riding shotgun and resisting every urge to kill him and leave him on the side of the road. Oy, so annoying.

For some odd reason people don't speed in Ohio. OK, some people do and they get on the wrong side of the Ohio Highway Patrol who is a tad anal about speed. I had Jac pull over and let me drive. The choice was either he let me drive or he could wind up floating in Lake Erie. I had had enough of his lousy driving. 

I got the lasagna and it was heavenly. There is nothing like Cleveland Italian food. Jac got the orange roughy. I dont think he got the memo that this was an ITALIAN restaurant. Who orders fish when you're surrounded by all this great pasta and pizza? We both enjoyed our meals and I vowed to return as often as I could even though it meant a 200 mile round trip. Sometimes you have to drive for good food.

I have not been there in years and from the other reviews it sounds like it has changed since I have been there. When I went it was fantastic, all due to a little paragraph I read in the paper."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I have never been to Maria's unless I was in the tight fisted grip of a mind numbing hangover.  So what do you have to walk through to get to the restaurant?  10 points to you if you guessed the bar.  Ouch!  I also have to admit I have never had anything but the chicken or veal parm which is the most ridiculously perfect hangover remedy in the history of me.  The atmosphere is dim and the layout of the restaurant tends to muffle any loud sounds that might try to pry their way into your aching brain.  The wait staff is very attentive.  Water is a big factor on these days and they make sure your glass is always full.  The food is heavenly.  They don't overindulge in cheese which is the first step in ruining  good parmigian and the sauce is light and flavorful.  The pasta side (Carbs are another big plus on these days) is always al dente and freshly cooked.  Maria's has never failed me.  I have always walked out feeling better than when I walked in.  I'm sure everything else they do here is just as fabulous.  Someday I will have to check that out.  In the meantime now you know where to go on THOSE days."}
