{"text":"I CANNOT BELIEVE this place still only has two reviews. You buggers need to discover it now. STILL the best sandwich in town.

I felt the need to update after today's amazing and amusing pit stop at Garage. After a trip to the gym, I paid a visit to my favourite little hidden gem, only this time I had to switch up my toppings since going vegan a month ago.

So I'm standing there, contemplating my masterpiece. I ticked off avocado on the paper... hummus.... rye... and then my favourite Sammich Guy was like, \"WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!\" And I explained that since going vegan, I'm not sure what the best combo of toppings would be. He looked at me, looked at the paper, grabbed it, crumpled it, threw it in the can and started cutting some bread.

\"When I started working here I was vegan. I've got this.\"

And lawd, he really did make me the best sandwich. Sweet potato, avocado, cucumber, hummus, lettuce, sprouts and honey mustard - seriously satisfying. 

They know sandwiches. Forgodsakes, go."}
{"text":"USED to go all the time and it USED to be a great place to get a sandwich.. Stale bread, missing ingredients, and sloppy assembly as of late. To top things off employees disappear for long periods of time leaving you wondering if they are even open! Didn't care for the rude woman with poor people skills either.  Won't be going back... Ever. Yes, I made this account just to write this review."}
{"text":"This is possibly the best place to get a sandwich in the city.  I try to make it here at least once a week. The staff are fantastic and the food is amazing.  Be sure to get the garage mayo on whatever you get.  

Also the Chicken Pot Pies are there occasionally as a special and possibly the best I've ever had.  They're actially quite light compared to others and there's a wonderful white wine flavour in the sauce.  Love the garlic penne salad and the veggie wraps as well. In fact I've yet to have anything bad from this place!

Heads up that this is the ORIGINAL Garage Sandwich Company on Church St. in the back of Pusateri's grocery store. Not the fake new  place that recently opened up in the former Rainbow/Big Johnson's location on the corner.  Don't miss this place, it's a gem in the city!"}
