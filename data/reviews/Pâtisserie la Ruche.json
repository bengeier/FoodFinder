{"text":"Family-run La Ruche opened its doors in August 2013, at the bustling intersection of Mont-Royal and Parc Avenue. It's a spacious, sunny location expertly decorated in white tile, honeycomb mosaics, and beautiful wood. The honeycomb theme extends to the pastry counter, where fresh-made delicacies are tucked in honeycomb-shaped wooden shelves.   La Ruche opens bright and early (7 AM), providing locals with an excellent option for fresh-baked goods and coffee. Everything is made on the spot. You can order your coffee directly from a window located on the Mont-Royal side of La Ruche, or wander in to study the pastry counter, satisfy your sweet tooth, and munch in the store while watching the Parc Avenue traffic roll by.    My fave offering at La Ruche thus far? Fresh, oozing, delectable honeycomb pieces served to you directly from a beehive screen on the counter. According to the staff, the honeycomb screens are sourced from hives located in Northern Quebec. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, great quality coffee, pastries and food, and an overall friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Since the queue at L'Avenue was too long (check it out- great place to cure a hangover with tasty, good quality and copious brunch) we went to try out La Ruche, a neat little pastry shop at the corner of Jeanne-Mance park that had caught my attention by its cool design.  In few words, ingredients are fresh with above par quality, menu is original and truly delightful and atmosphere is calm and happy.  Warnings: Again, it is not a place where you go to cure a hangover (better go to L'Avenue or Fabergé) but you do get that satisfactory feeling of having a quality meal. Of course, you will pay a tad more for this (Around 17$ to 20$ with coffee included) while portions are reasonnable without being enormous.  The limited menu also explains the two missing stars.  Yet, La Ruche is a fresh alternative to other heavier brunch place that you will be pleased to try out!  PS: Being first and foremost a pastry shop (excellent one I might say) brunches are only offered on weekends."}
{"text":"Très bel endroit, quoi que pratiquement désert un lundi matin (et pendant les 30 minutes où j'y suis restée). Gamme de choix intéressants derrière le présentoir, belle présentation. J'ai opté pour un croissant (censé être sorti droit du four selon la jeune pâtissière) et une tartelette aux noix avec un latte. Croissant froid (!) et sec (j'ai demandé de la confiture aux agrumes à mettre dessus, qu'il fallait payer (oops, je ne savais pas!) mais heureusement excellente) et croûte de tartelette vraiment dure - pas vraiment de plaisir à manger.   Le latte était OK, et les prix, raisonnables!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. Was meeting someone who suggested we meet there. First time - but it will be the last time too for sure!  There is so many other options where people greet you with smile, are polite, seem to enjoy what they do... Why would anyone bother goung to such a place. What an attitude... Should consider goung into another business like laying asphalt or painting bridges, where you are not required to interact too much with humans"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  We visited Montreal this weekend and we were staying 1/2 block from La Ruche, we were just looking for some croissants and coffee one morning and decided to pop in there because it was close and easy.... BEST DECISION EVER!!!  We went back the next morning.   We ordered Latte with their house made Caramel Sauce, a breakfast croissant with ham, cheese and a poached egg and a cheese croissant togo.   EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!   The coffee, the espresso was rich, smokey and sweet, the milk was steamed to perfection with beautiful latte art and the house made caramel was sweet and rich without being too sweet or too rich!    The egg croissant was sweet and savory.  The pastry was flaky, buttery and soft and the egg was cooked perfectly!   Later we snacked on the Cheese Croissant and it was so great!    We went back the next morning and everything was just as wonderful!!  I would actually go back to Montreal just to go to this Patisserie!   LOVE!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafés in Montreal. Great location next to Parc Mont Royal, friendly staff, and the most delicious white chocolate cheesecake. I also love their caramel latte, which is made of real caramel instead of syrup. A little bit pricey for a student, that's why only 4 stars. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For what it lacks in a small menu it makes up for it in having everything on said menu being delicious.   Though it sounds ultra-rich at first, the French Toast with ham on top (sorry I forgot the dish's name!) was excellent. Surprisingly not too sweet despite the ham having a sweet glaze while perching atop French Toast. My friend also ordered the Avocado Tartine (I think thats what it was?), which was really good. The coffee is also really good I might add. The pastries are also great, as this is a patissiere.   Friendly, attentive service. Its a small place but my party of 6 had little trouble being seated on a weekend."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw something was opening on the North West corner of Parc and Mont-Royal.  While I will always remember this as the location of a Macdonalds back when I was a teen, since then it has had several different businesses set up only to shutter a short time later.  Hopefully La Ruche beats the odds and sticks it out, because it's great having a nice business back on this corner, even better when it's one that serves delicious baked goods and beverages.  The space is really beautiful, full of wood and stainless steel and honeycomb patterns.  You can even watch the different food items being prepared from behind a window.  The counter set up gets a little confusing when there are lots of people in line, but that's because there are so many different pastries, you'll want to look at all of them before settling.  So onto the pastries: so far I've only sampled a turnover, but that was a damn good turnover!  There are all kinds of goodies tempting me to return: cakes, croissants, turnovers, breads, cookies, etc.  On Saturday morning I popped in for a coffee, and there were these delicious looking muffin cup egg concoctions begging to be consumed.  Moving along to the beverages: they really do have a full selection of beverages, caffeinated and non.  The hot chocolate really stood out to me: it was the perfect combination of quality and price.  The latte I had on another visit left a bit to be desired.  It wasn't bad, I just find I make better at home, though perhaps I prefer the beans I use.  I'll have to investigate the bean situation on future visits (because there WILL be future visits, I've got pastries to sample)."}
{"text":"Pretty pricy for sandwhiches and meals! However, their food is delicious. Talk about freshness, flavour, and feeling good after a meal. I didnt enter Itistown after eating a whole smoked salmon baugette, along with an isreali cous cous salad and a home made ice tea. Hands down I would come back here for that. Their chocolate croussaints were my least favorite part of my meal, they just didnt do anything for me.  The people who work here are very friendly, helpful and patient. Also, their bathrooms are so nice!"}
{"text":"cute café that serves homemade pastries.   But was chocked by the manager who came to my friend and I and asked us to leave if we weren't buying anything else. Her reason was to keep a \"good relationship\" with her clients. We were the only clients in the café.   Not only that but the manager didn't hesitate to yell on her employee , who was far more professional than her .   I don't think it is a proper way to treat your only clients and your employee who is doing an amazing job .   Very disappointed ."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  We were walking back to our hotel and on a whim decided to stop in and check it out.  Best decision ever.  Everything we tried was absolutely delicious.  They have a large and interesting selection, everything is homemade, and the staff is lovely.  I wish I was local; I would definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite cafe in Montreal. They have great croissants, brownies, sandwiches and coffee. My personal favourite is the mocha. I would come here everyday if i could!!"}
{"text":"Bright atmosphere and delicious pastries, right by Mont Royal park. The perfect place for a snack before or after exploring the park!"}
{"text":"One of the rudest experiences I had in Montreal!!!! I ordered a tart,walked 4 meters and  went back to ask them if I can get a cheesecake instead. The owner  refused in a super rude way. I offered many scenarios like paying the difference in cash but she was simply was lazy and rude. At first she lied and told me she can't do reimbursement for transactiobs less than 5$. when I told her the transaction worth 8$, she told me she can't technically do that. When I offered to pay the rest in cash she told me she can't because \"she already put the tart it in a plate and can't return it to the fridge\"!!!!"}
{"text":"Tout est délicieux a cette pâtisserie, issue d'une famille passionnée. Déguster les gâteaux, viennoiseries et les sandwiches. Il faut absolument essayer le brunch, Tartine a l'avocat !"}
{"text":"Très bonne pâtisserie.  Ils servent aussi des brunchs. Le seul hic, est qu'on retrouve assez souvent les mêmes desserts"}
{"text":"Un peu mal pris pour un dessert, pour un souper dernieres minutes, j'ai decide d'entrer et d'acheter sans meme avoir lu aucun avis. Ceci dit je vais y retourner quand meme!   L'endroit, ancien McDonald, est super moderne et confortable pour prendre un cafe. Il y avait tres tres peu de choix de gateaux, et quelques patisseries a l'unite interessantes pour un mardi apres-midi. J'ai opté pour les petites tartelettes: noix, pate d'amande, brownies et une bizarre en pate filet, fromage et miel. Toutes tres bonnes et plein de saveurs, sauf celle au brownie a eviter, au prix du gramme vaut mieux t'acheter un gateau vachon!   Resume: cher, savoureux, a reessayer!"}
{"text":"A very good surprise near the Tam-tams part of Mont Royal Park  They have a very nice selection of pastries and confectioneries (and by that I mean you'll have a hard time picking what you want). Get a coffee or something similar to accompany."}
{"text":"This cafe is really nice. The employees are so friendly and helpful. My friends and I were staying at an Airbnb around the corner, so we came here often during our trip to grab a bite before heading out for the rest of the day. None of us speak any French, and the employees were glad to help us decipher the brunch options when Google translate was a little lacking.   The pastries and coffee were pretty good, but the sandwiches are where it's at. I tried a sandwich with brie, ham and pickles on a baguette, which was tasty, but the sandwich that really wowed both my friend and me was one on brioche with some sort of tuna salad and watercress. Not sure exactly what it was called because we were in a rush to get to the train station, but it was great."}
{"text":"I have sweet teeth and very picky with pastries. La Ruche got me. I'd love to come back next time I visit Montréal again!!"}
{"text":"Quel charmant endroit. Le décor est bien agréable et j'adore qu'on utilise le concept \"abeille-alvéole-miel\" partout. J'ai eu la chance d'y aller à un moment où ce n'était pas du tout achalandé (fin d'après-midi, un lundi) et la commis a pu prendre le temps de me parler des pâtisserie et de l'histoire de la place, le service était donc super sympathique et convivial. J'ai pris le gâteau au fromage sur place avec un latté frappé et vraiment les deux étaient délicieux et bien apprêtés. J'ai également pris une bouchée du croissant aux noix et chocolat mais malheureusement celui-ci n'était pas à la hauteur de mes attentes (après le délicieux cheesecake) car il était très sec  (sec, non pas \"flaky\"). J'ai également goûté la tarte à la lime le lendemain (tant qu'à y aller...) qui était très bien et j'ai également acheté la confiture figues-amandes qui est délicieuse mais TRÈS sucrée. En sommes, je retournerai dans cette pâtisserie lorsque j'aurai envie d'un endroit convivial où l'on trouve de bons entremets.  En plus, on encourage une entreprise locale et familiale ! thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most understated breakfast spot near the Park Mont Royal. Everything we ordered was prompt and well executed. I particularly like the avocado toast, the pressed sandwich with sundried tomatoes was also delicious. After breakfast we walked through the park all the way up to the lookout. A great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Après une belle marche sur le Mont--Royal avec mon frère, nous cherchions une petite place pour casser la croûte et nous réchauffer un peu. Dehors, il fait au moins --10 degrés Celsius... Nous sommes entrés dans ce charmant café familial et nous avons commandé la soupe du jour, du thé chaï, un thé Kusmi et un biscuit à la cannelle.  Tout d'abord, je dois mentionner que tout est fait sur place: les pâtisseries, gâteaux, pains et biscuits, les soupes, sandwichs et salades. Même le mélange de thé chaï est une création maison! Une étoile de plus! Tout semble appétissant: il y a beaucoup de choix, que ce soit pour un goûter, un repas léger ou un petit déjeuner!  La soupe était une crème de lentilles--cumin, bien relevée et veloutée. Servie avec des croûtons, c'était idéal pour un petit creux. Le thé chaï est un délice, légèrement sucré, on goûtait bien les épices. Le thé Kusmi était énorme! Dans une tasse pour emporter, je l'ai terminé dans la voiture. Le biscuit à la cannelle était intéressant: une pâte aux noix sucrée qui goûtait le miel, miam!   La décoration est simple et raffinée, beaucoup de bois et des céramiques qui rappellent les alvéoles d'une ruche. D'ailleurs, les employés sont très gentils et travaillent comme des petites abeilles dans la cuisine ouverte. Les prix sont corrects, vu la qualité de la bouffe. Une bien belle surprise pour moi"}
{"text":"Although the food here is phenomenal and always fresh, a recently unpleasant and rather rude encounter with an employee left my friend and I questioning whether it's worth coming back to La Ruche.   The patience and hospitality of this employee did not extend far when they quite rudely yelled and told us off for bringing and eating a small bit of personal food (even after we had bought a notable amount of food and drinks from them).  I understand not wanting external food in your cafe but there's a way to communicate this to customers. However the way this employee did so left us feeling unwelcome and to likely never want to give them a chance to welcome us back."}
{"text":"Paterisserie La Ruche is always on the way between the Plateau and downtown.   Food: It's literally perfect for everything from a quick Americano or latte to a little sweet treat or a full-on lunch (Sandwiches, salads, quiches and soups). I've tried almost all the lunch options they have and my favourite is their quiches. They're perfectly individual sized and super satisfying flavour combinations like leek and goat cheese. For desserts, I haven't tried all of them but the individual black forest is a favourite of mine. For pastries, their croissants are amazing. They also have a short but varied brunch menu.  Vibes: All the staff there is really helpful - They make you feel very comfortable and check up on you which is more rare at a cafe.   Decor: Really vibrant garden decor with yellow metal furniture and real plants. Their picnic tables seems to have warped over time and make it a realllly awkward place to sit but it is one of the only options if you have a group of 4.   The ONLY small downside: Recently they removed their Wifi because they were having trouble keeping it under control. It's too bad because it's the perfect place to study if you want somewhere with good coffee as well as food."}
{"text":"La Ruche. La Ruche. La Ruche is on fire.   I've been eyeing this brunch spot for a while now, and for whatever reason, today was the day where the stars aligned. Like the siren's song, I was lured through the rain to this pleasant patisserie, and treated to an exceptional classic breakfast. And while it wasn't anything overly sophisticated, it was the little things that made this breakfast stand out. From the minced chives on the eggs to the potatoes cooked in duck fat, it felt like a home cooked meal, made by someone who really loves you. And at the end of the day, that's what a good breakfast should be all about."}
{"text":"Wanted to give a try to La Ruche after reading so many great reviews. And while I was hoping to be able to add mine, I have to say the disappointment was there. I didnt not sit down for a meal there but picked up some soup with bread. The soup was $8 for a what they call a large but is more of a small bowl (you wont be full after that) that doesnt come with anything and was way too salty.  The bread I bought on the side was much better but dry and pretty expensive compared to Premiere Moisson. $15 total for 2 not-so-good items that I still had to add food to for it to be a meal.  The staff on the other side was welcoming and helpful.  Would I go back? maybe to try their restaurant style menu. But the boulangerie side , definitely not."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars often.. but this patisserie definitely deserves some attention. We walked by this place on our way to Mont Royal Park.. the eye-catching decor quickly attracted us.  Food: 5/5 everything there looks absolutely pretty (this would be a perfect place for all you phone-eats-first yelpers). The black forest cake was moist and fresh, it was delicious! Their coffee there wasn't the best but it's not bad.  Staff: 5/5 super nice and friendly  Decor: 4.5/5 I was so impressed at the mini garden in the back.   Will I come back?: YES! Absolutely! I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys pastries!"}
{"text":"We went to slide the mountain and after 2 hours in the snow we needed a warm drink. Our usual place was closed due to the holiday (Jan 1st) so we decided to try this place. It was around 4 pm and they were out of most of the pastries :( my wife had a coffee she claimed was not that amazing, I had an amazing lemon meringue which for me is worth the 4th star BUT while the cakes were good the prices here are very high...I would re visit only if there is reasonable priced place near by"}
{"text":"Jolie place pour une pause verte en ville, patisseries , sandwiches , salades etc. Proche du Mont royal."}
{"text":"Very good food, patisseries are refined and delicate - excellent all around."}
{"text":"Je n'ai jamais gouté leurs produit, aujourd'hui j'ai visité l'endroit pour la premiere fois , mais je suis rentrée dans un cadre professionnelle autant qu'une representante d'une compagnie de telecommunication, a la caisse j'ai demandé si je peux parler avec la proprietaire, il avait une dame sur une chaise roulante, elle m'a dit c'est moi , alors je me suis presenter et d'un seule cou, elle m'a repondu avec aucun respect \"sortez d'ici\" , la j'ouvre une parenthse, de 1 elle est commercante et elle des clients , est ce qu'elle accepte que ses clients la traite d'une facon mal, 2 si elle a vecu une mauvaise experience avec une compagnie, pourquoi elle crit et elle insulte un representant qui est un employé Je suis vraime t desolee le manque du profesionalisme et le manque de respect sont primordiale pour gerer un business Je ne recommmande jamais cette patisserie"}
