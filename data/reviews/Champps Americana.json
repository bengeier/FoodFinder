{"text":"We've been going to Champps for many years and have noticed that, lately, it hasn't been as great as it once was.   Their menu certainly has a lot of variety, from burgers to salads to tacos, and everything always tastes great.   However, the restaurant itself is beginning to appear a bit \"tired\", and it could use a renovation.   Also, the service is hit-or-miss. Sometimes, the wait staff are very friendly and helpful, but other times they seem bored and unmotivated. More and more often, the latter seems to be the quality of service that you get.   Parking is never a problem (they have a large, free lot).   All in all, it's okay, but you could do better. I'd rather go to the Winking Lizard or Panini's."}
{"text":"Chammps food is good but way over priced. We ordered a turkey wrap that was over $10 and another sandwich that was over $12 It was just ok. Great service though."}
{"text":"Was completely disappointed with this place. They got my bosses lunch wrong not once but twice. The restaurant smelled weird and everyone in my lunch party got sick from the food."}
{"text":"This place is located across the street (almost) from my office.  This location gives discounts to my company's employees.  I still won't eat here.    Yeah, the food is the typical American chain restaurant type food.  DÃ©cor is boring.  Beer selection is boring.    I just can't get excited about Champps.  At gunpoint, I'll hit it up for a beer after work.  And it better be a big gun, or I'll risk some shrapnel.    The staff is never consistently friendly.  Sure, you get pockets of nice folks, but usually they are just not very friendly, or quick.    Meh.  Go next door to J. Alexanders, and get good food, better atmosphere, and better service."}
{"text":"The menu and selection is typical of a corp. sports bar, nothing special or authentic. Food was good but the experience was boring"}
{"text":"I've been going to Champps for years and have been sort of a fan.  I think I even had my first legal drink at this location - a vodka cranberry - woo!  Last night I was at Champps for an event that I had organized for an academic group that I belong to.  We had reserved part of the very nice enclosed patio in the back of the restaurant.  We ordered some light appetizers - chicken fingers and spinach artichoke dip - and were surprised to find that chips and salsa and a veggie tray were thrown in with the deal.  Our servers were ok.  They had a large section to cover besides our party room, so a lot of people had to walk up to the bar.  The manager on duty did a great job of making sure that we were ok and didn't need anything.  I hear the food was good, although I was too busy to eat.  I did enjoy the $5 cosmo special.  They also had $4 margaritas and some beer specials.  The guests at the event said they enjoyed the venue, so I'd definitely consider booking another party there again."}
{"text":"I've been visiting places lately in hopes of completing my long ago started list for cheap weeknight grub in the eastern burbs, alas, I must remove Champps from that list because they killed their happy hour. They have their big corporate drink menu with a whole page devoted to happy hour, and should you choose to turn to that page, you will find it blank. If I had a list called \"Places I Won't be Watching the Game\" this place would be on it. So sad...  They do, however have a pint night on Thursdays with $2.50 pints. So, that will redeem them.  But, why, even without happy hour food would they earn a mere 2-star review? I was debating between one star and two stars, but I would like to reserve the precious one stars for places that are truly awful in some way, and as I say below, these guys are more mediocre than awful. Nevertheless, they bear several distinctions that have helped them earn their low rating.  1. They have distinguished themselves with the slowest lunch service anywhere near my office. If you have a meeting after lunch, you can't even think about this place. Getting in and out in about 90 minutes is pretty average. 2. They served me the worst steak I've ever had in my life. It was overcooked, chewy, and gamy.  And I've had the steaks at buffet type restaurants. 3. Finally, general mediocrity. These guys embody the American corporate restaurant ideal of quantity over quality. And they sure do give you quantity. Alas, their beer list is mediocre, and their prices are mediocre. I'll pass.  But, I should be fair and point out a couple redeeming traits. They have TVs everywhere and aside from that one steak, the food is pretty decent. It's heavy, filling food and lots of it. Finally, there is pint night on Thursdays, which is likely the only day you'll see me there now that their happy hour was abolished."}
{"text":"Where do I begin...  This place has definitely gone downhill from when I was a kid.  It's quite expensive for the quality and taste of the food that you get.  We did have a coupon for $10 off $30 or more.  I didn't get \"amazing\" service from a hostess.  In fact, she was barely at our table.  It wasn't a very busy time or anything, she was off chatting with her other coworkers for the most part.  I couldn't get her attention for a refill on my drink and I'm pretty sure I got the wrong entree.  I ordered the artichoke and chicken pasta...but I didn't have any artichokes on my plate.  The one thing that was really nice is that they split my dad and stepmom's dish for us.  They ordered an entree to share and it came pre-split with an even serving."}
{"text":"How did I end up here? Not by choice.  Peer pressure by the co workers.  I have never been a fan of the American style GENERIC chain sport bars!!!     I walked in on a Tuesday night to watch the Miami/Boston game.  There were no Lebron fans in sight, actually there was no one in the bar besides our group.  I wonder if the community is still bitter about Lebron.  I would hope they would go watch the game to CHEER against Miami.   Back to this lovely establishment.  Service was AWESOME!!!  Well that is expected since we were the only ones in there.    I had the buffalo chicken sandwich with blue cheese.  Chicken tasted bland as expected. The beer selection was ok.  I did get a COLD ONE that hit the spot.  The cold beer did make the game more enjoyable.      Typical to what I expected, I received MEDIOCRE OVERPRICED bar food.  I'd rather sit in my hotel room, get a SIX PACK, and eat a PBJ.  Next time I will not cave into PEER PRESSURE."}
{"text":"I like Champps.  The buffalo chicken sandwich with waffle fries is good, and surprisingly healthy.  Grilled chicken and the ranch comes on the side - so it isn't bad.  They have gigantic beers and a good happy hour.  Most importantly, this is a great sports bar.  TV's on every wall and typically a sports friendly crowd.  Champps is definitely a good spot to grab a drink, some bar food, and check out the game."}
{"text":"If you sit at the bar, this place has the worst service ever!   I have has the same impression every time I am there.   Tonight, it took about ten minutes for the bartender to stop socializing with the servers and come near me so I could wave my hand and ask for a drink.   When our drinks were empty, we had to wave her down again.  When we wanted to order food, we had to go out of our way to tell them.  Then, the good came out wrong.   Then the bill was erroneous.   Then they started taking all the dirty glasses and stacked them in front of us.    The food was as expected, the service was as bad as it gets, and was last time I was there too."}
{"text":"The food earned this review it's extra star. My Tucson Salmon with veg was great.   The service however, beginning with the hostess, 2 stars. The hostess seemed dead. She clearly wanted to be anywhere else - she didn't look at us after putting our menus down and walked right away without even wishing us a good meal. The place was empty as we came at a bit after 2p for a late lunch so there was no reason she had to rush away. In general all the staff looked really tired and hot, though the temperature in the restaurant was fine for us and they weren't busy so they weren't running around. Never did see a manager figure walk around either."}
