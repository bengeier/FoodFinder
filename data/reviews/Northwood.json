{"text":"Came for a drink with a friend last week. We were just bar hopping through the neighbourhood and came across Northwood. I loved the cozy feel of the bar. Our waitress was great. I wasn't sure what to drink and she recommended a gin based drink with thyme, I think the Choupette. It was AMAZING! I go out for cocktails regularly and I must say I loved this one! My friend got a classic old fashioned which was also great! Can't wait to come back and try more cocktails!"}
{"text":"I love this place but they're a tad overpriced. I find myself only ever going between 5-7 when it is $2 off draught."}
{"text":"My friends and I happened to stumbled on this gem a couple of months ago on a Wednesday night.  A deal was on for a buck oysters and half price wine and we took them up on the offer.  It turned out to be a great decision.  The oyster was fresh, the wine was chilled and the server was nice.  We've since become regulars."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with the baby on a lazy Sunday afternoon while our 3 year old was with a family member.   It was pleasantly busy, and we managed to snag a 4-top by the window.   Service was pleasant and fast.  They have 4 or 5 beers on tap, including two from Beau's Brewery (yum)!  They also had a full cocktail menu, if that's your thing.     The day we came they were doing a pop-up brunch, $20 pp for an appetizer, main, and dessert.  We are vegan, and that wasn't a problem at all.  The food was delicious and creatively done.    Other than that, they had some baked goods on offer, but I didn't see any vegan options for those (I could be wrong though).      One of the bartenders is my fave bartender who used to work at Disgraceland down the street, and she's a total sweetheart and is GREAT at what she does.  I would love to come back here at night and check out the vibe.    One complaint:  I really wish that they had drip coffee.  I almost took off a 1/2 star, but I really liked this space so much that I couldn't bring myself to do it."}
{"text":"Northwood is far too often overlooked regarding their well thought out beer menu. With excellent options in style and brewery range, this place is a win! Recently they have started offering a more substantial food menu and it is all homemade and VERY tasty! Service is friendly, efficient and well informed. Oh and P.S. their coffee is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night after dinner in ktown, which was just a short walk away. The place was fairly packed around 9pm and we got a seats at the bar, the atmosphere was great! I ordered a their cocktail special which was a \"punch\" with rum and spices and it was very good! They also have a good beer selection and drinks were reasonably prices. The place is a little small so the waitress would bump into me sometimes walking from the kitchen to the tables and there were limited number of hooks for your bag and coat but will definitely be coming back for drinks and checking out other restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Fun and creative drink selection, including retro-style drinks. Lady Grey cocktail was very good. Nice ambiance!"}
{"text":"Would move to the neighborhood just to visit Northwood more often.   The experience at Northwood is special, from the music to the staff and (most importantly) the drinks. It's the perfect spot for date night drinks, or catching up with a small group of friends.   I can't think of anywhere else in Toronto that you get 2-2.5 oz cocktails for such reasonable prices ($11-14 for most), and they are some of the best drinks you'll have in the city. My boyfriend and I went recently and each had 3 cocktails, each better than the last. Our favorites were La Commune and Black Walnut.  The bartender we had last time was fantastic. She managed to get cocktails out to 30 people quickly, was able to answer questions about the drinks, and was really friendly.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I came twice here and both times was turned away because they were at capacity.   The first time I left my number and was texted back 1.5 hours later. It seems unbelievable that the next available seat needed a 1.5 hour wait.   The second time there was clearly a woman at the bar leaving and an empty stool next to her but I still received the same response. I told the host not to bother taking my number.  Maybe I don't fit the clientele or the host didn't want to bother serving me... the drinks were good in the past but I couldn't care for the host."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. The atmosphere was both intimate and welcoming. We had prompt and friendly service and without doubt the best cocktails I've yet to experience in Toronto. Would recommend this spot to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Another favourite local hangout. I usually go here because Northwood has some of the best coffee in the city--aside from Lit/Crema. The baristas do a great job, and they never mess up the espresso. Also, the cocktails are super inventive.   I was here for brunch a few weeks ago, and it was delicious. I had the Northwood after explaining gluten allergies to the server. The bacon was really good quality, and the eggs were perfectly poached. I can confirm that the potatoes were crispy as advertised."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to the neighbourhood -  I haven't been during the day for coffee etc, but I'm in love with the atmosphere and coming here mostly at night. Have been here a few times always with great service, amazing cocktails and is now my new fav place for Buck-a-Shuck oyster nights on Wednesdays. Make sure to get there early though after 6 because it fills up! Had a small birthday gathering here and had no issues by calling a week in advance!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quiet Sunday night. Staff was kind and prompt. The toddy warmed us up, and the wine was lovely. The lighting really made the place feel intimate and almost secret like a speak easy."}
{"text":"I recently started going to Northwood with a couple of friends to do some work during the afternoon. I really like the atmosphere and the service, as the staff is nice and attentive. The decor of the place is fitting as it both a bar and café, and the tables are comfortable to sit on. The best part about the place, for those of us who have an incessant need to be connected to the grid, is the ample amount of plugs. I don't understand places that do not provide sufficient plugs for their customers--many of whom are graduate students or young professionals--, because it means that people who would become regulars--and spend more money--simply don't. I used to be a regular at another café nearby, but since they do not have many plugs--it was somewhat like Lord the Flies in there--I have opted to go to Northwood instead. In addition, they have free and fast wifi."}
{"text":"Nice little bar with atmoshere and good selection of drinks, including some beers on tap. Little because seating might be limited, but patio in summer time is rather large. People are friendly."}
{"text":"Just go to Northwood, it speaks for itself.  I have been here a number of times, and the first time was a spontaneous choice as my boyfriend had just heard that a bar opened up around the corner from our apartments. So I went, and we brought along his out of town friends as well.   The atmosphere is fantastic, not exactly a sea storm of young and beautiful and young and restless youths doll'd up to indulge in the consumption of sweet sweet liquid luck that will hopefully lead them to sweet sweet bedroom luck.   Not that you cannot achieve that, I mean, their beer menu has the most amazing selection ranging from local blends, to Deu du Ciel, Cheval Blanc, and Beau's (a personal preference)! And the cocktail artist makes fantastic gin creations, also their bourbon is...well...as good as bourbon can excel to be. And the music is soulful!   But what I am trying to get at is that in Northwood, there is a crowd that will appreciate your chiller conversational mood, and will happily adapt to your fluctuating happy intoxicated and comically conversational mood as you keep ordering lovely rounds of lovely things!  Sometimes they will have an amazing chef in the house, he will cook up the most amazing pop up menu for dinner, or tiny bites, or just midnight snacks that go really well with the fantastic musical accompaniment that they will provide on certain wonderful evenings. If there isn't a DJ spinning very soulful jazz and funk vinyls to ignite your conversational moods, then there will be a DJ spinning really earthy shoe gaze rock and roll beats as they dim the lights so your refreshing moods are the only things that light up the atmosphere at night. Once, Brandan Canning was there spinning, along with a chef, but I could not go. Like their facebook page because they will update you on sweet events, and specialty beers being added!   Also, a perk, they are open daily from 10am to 2am!  So what are you supposed to do at Northwood at 10am?   Well, the cafe atmosphere there is amazing, I go there for  conversation dates, reading, and sometimes get a nook in the corner with a tab growing with Americano orders and just do my homework all day. The barista there is a fantastic person! The coffee creations are amazing, the music is delightful, the crowd is a wonderful mixture of the most interesting and exciting and sometimes the most calming people you may want to start a conversation with, or merely just exchange a smile and a laugh with or ask for the time.   I love it here. It's exactly what the growing suburban and urban members of the Chirstie Pits neighbourhood needed to come together and be happy."}
{"text":"Been here many times, it's always great! Amazing beer selection. Perfect date or just casual place. No pretentiousness, friendly service."}
{"text":"I dig Northwood.  It's the perfect spot along the Bloor strip if you're not in the mood for a dive pub or sports bar. It's casual/classy, with a relaxed vibe that still feels special. I like how dimly lit it it.  The cocktails and beer selection are awesome, though I will say slightly overpriced (hence the 4 stars).  Overall a great place to hang, whether stopping in for a casual drink or going on a date."}
{"text":"I was at Northwood on Friday August 8, 2014 with some friends.  First the place has the worst menu...one of the dish is white beans blended in house with some dry bread! seriously!! you could at least use real beans. It tasted like water sewage. I am still washing my mouth from that.  Now I was Ok with that after all it is a drinking place so I did not go there for the food.  Now we were a big group. We asked them to split our bills since we were drinking and we were not attached by the hips! The answer was no we do not do that unless you wanna give us your credit card and we open a tap. My boyfriend and I said yes to this. We gave our visa and order drinks and some lame food as follows:  Ginger ale 3 beers that awful white beans with the dry bread some even more awful cheese (I really hate French wanna be restaurants) one scotch one cider *extra side dish of bread.  Now, my b/f and I wanted to leave the party earlier so I approached the over worked bartender. I should mention now the place gets busy and they are very under staffed. I told him we had a tap and I would like to clear it. He gave me a bill and I noticed the scotch and three beers were missing...I told him about this omission....you see I could just not mention about this but I am a normal citizen not a thief!  He went back and added the drinks...here is my problem. He ADDED what I told him was missing but DID NOT TAKE IT OUT OF WHERE ELSE HE HAD IT! I mean yea busy but it is not my job to move drinks from one tap to another.  Now one of my friend called me the next day and told me they over charged her exactly those 4 drinks that I told him he was missing.  I sent the receipt to my friend and told her that it was paid in full except that side bread.  I  forgot to mention the extra sad bread order was not on my bill. I told my friend I am sorry I forgot the extra stupid bread...but I was pissed the restaurant charged my friends for something ALREADY PAID FOR!  Now this is my advise to Northwood or any other bar establishment serving groups that are not gonna all come together or leave together and not providing 5star menu:   If you are too cheap to have a system where you can put numbers so people can have different bills, perhaps you should not be in the bar business. No 10 people go to a place to have drinks and need to wait until the end of the night to pay all at the same time!!!!!! this is stupid!  You are Bloor and Ossington, a place to go before you go somewhere else...read your targets!!!  If you think your staff cannot keep track of who drinks what (assuming your staff is sober), funny you assumed your drinking patrons should do the calculations and the remembering!   It all boiled down to service. Your service sucks. You basically robbed my friend.  I will never be back at the Northwood and I hope you do not rip off others like you did to us. Also BTW, your staff was defensive...not sure if this was being overworked or underpaid or just cranky but guess what, I wished I did not tip you...  Have good short life."}
{"text":"Been here twice, enjoyed it both times. Great craft beer selection, everything from hoppy IPAs to sweet Belgian ales. Also an impressive cocktail menu, with some delicious concoctions. Try the Ruby for something sweet, or the Jacket Pocket for something a little more bracing Great intimate atmosphere, low lighting. Music and ambient noise is a little loud later in the evening. Place got busier the second time I was there, probably due to getting written up on BlogTO. Lots of hipsters"}
{"text":"Another amazing gem in the neighbourhood - excellent  coffee shop by day and bar by night. Northwood keeps us coming back for great coffee and superb cocktails. The music at night is just right. A new favourite, can't wait to try one of their pop up dinners or brunch."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to drink/sit/frig around on a laptop/watch people/get drunk at. It's very versatile.   Opens at 10am, have some Pig Iron Coffee (get that stuff at Lit Espresso Bar, too), sit and watch Christie Pitts park, get a sandwich, switch to bourbon, see who goes in and out of Toronto BJJ across the street, order more bourbon, and repeat.   Their cocktail menu is very impressive...not huge but the drinks on it are all delicious. I sort of regret writing this review because I don't want YOU sitting in my spot next time I go in. Yelp piggy backin', bastards."}
{"text":"A-OK in my books.   DRINKS: This is a great place for drinks, but wine wasn't half price on a Wednesday (boo). There was a promotion for cocktails but we are wine drinkers.  FOOD: Very limited snack/food selection, all bread based. Cheese platter was good, pickled bow was good, pork spread was meh. Each one came with a lot of freshly toasted baguette bread, which is a nice touch but ... so much bread.   AMBIANCE: A+! Great decor, it was full but still not too crazy noisy. We sat at the bar and finished at a table. Lighting not too dark - not too bright. Stylish.   This is an A-OK place to have a drink near Christie Pits. But I wouldn't stretch to 4 stars because of cost and (to me) dissatisfying snack choice."}
{"text":"The perfect place to down a few bottles of Dieu du Ciel Rosée d'Hibiscus in the middle of winter when you're really missing summer. Love the mood lighting and actual candles this place has - full of character without trying too hard."}
{"text":"A nice little place.  I've only grabbed a drink here with a friend but I really enjoyed the ambiance of the place and the beer suggestion was on point by the waitress.  Large drinks menu with lots of different liquors, beers, wines, and some mixed cocktails.  I will definitely go again and try some of the food next time.  Only problem is that it became a little crowded and loud, understandable since it was a Saturday night and the place is new so there's some buzz around it but we had to leave since we couldn't hear each other talk."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance at this place. The staff is extremely nice and they serve really good cocktails. My favourite being the Choupette, its delicious.  Mr. H and I go quite often and even took our friends from the US, everyone loved the place. We once had to wait a long time before a table was available, there was one empty table but the customers were out smoking (for like an hour!) and the waitress was getting annoyed too. She said she would ask them to leave once they came back and move us over and she made sure to follow through.  The later in the night it gets to louder the place gets too so keep that in mind, the place does however have a relaxed vibe and fun to visit with friends.  (Ps: i have only been here late nights)"}
{"text":"Northwood has been on my list of places to check out for some time now and so glad that I was in Koreatown so that I could drop by.  The drink menu is bigger than the food menu - my kind of place.  Between the selection of classic cocktails, original cocktails, sours & smashes and coffee-based drinks, I was in lush heaven. The drinks are boozy but delicious.  I really enjoyed the twists on the classic cocktails.  Can't complain about about the price either - $14 a pop is a steal.  I highly recommend the papermoon as a shot choice (can be served as a cocktail as well).  Cute patio too.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Thanks to my DT-TO partner in crime Evelyn W for bringing me to her secret happy place where good things come in a cup all day long. She invited me here on a GTA/TO work day and said this was the place to be for Coffee, Cocktails and WiFi.  I arrived a tad early and got a chance to scope out the joint for myself and was really impressed with the caged in bar, uber clean basement bathrooms and the espresso machines spoutin' steam ready to whip up my order. Even got a few moments alone with the morning barista before the crowds flocked in, she was very knowledgeable about her bean and made me a stellar Americano that kept the fire going most of the morning!  After taking a brief break for lunch, we returned and I sat with a great cup of tea while I did my afternoon work. Upon our afternoon return Northwood was bustling with would be bloggers, next-gen work from hom-ers and various other Apple computer users. One item of note that as the body count rises in here, so to does the temperature and before long I was stripped down to my undershirt and jeans. So ensure you layer even in the dead of winter.  While the preceding Americano and Tea were essential parts of my functioning day, the part I enjoyed the most was my end of day cocktail. A real treat lay in store for me as I let the staff choose my poison for me and I was blessed to be granted the opportunity to sip on their Smoked Old Fashioned done with maple syrup...  So many Canadian flavours in my mouth at one time!!! I felt like was wearing flannel and a toque (I probably was), while sitting in a Quebec sugar shack, dining on Moose Meat and duck while watching Hockey Night In Canada. Yes! All that came to me whilst sippin' on this sweet-n-smokey delight!"}
{"text":"Nice little bar in the Bloor/Ossington 'hood. Had a few delicious cocktails made by a very attentive lady bartender. Came for a food pop-up & enjoyed everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"In the middle of a major snowstorm what does one do when there is an event hosted  by the Legendary Jennifer K well one braves the elements and digs in further.  This spot is not that far from a subway stop though it did feel like quite a walk given the snow packed sidewalk. In summer one will hardly notice the distance.  Nevertheless all the gloom disappeared when I saw the host sitting at the bar enjoying a drink. The setup is simple yet effective. They had a happy hour going on a Saturday till 7 for some draft drinks but I had to order a bottle of ST BERNARDUS ABT 12  since the first batch sold out at LCBO. The server was a bit taken aback as I guess not many people order this bottle and brought out the wrong glass at first and even had a bit of trouble opening the bottle. Nevertheless having it on the list is good enough in my book. The place has a laid back feel and is good spot to chat and enjoy, or just unwind which alright in my book. A great start to a great evening (or one can call it a good place to end a miserable day) 3.5 Stars.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great little bar with a cozy vibe. Came in on a snowy night to find to my delight that they serve 1/2 priced wine on Wednesday nights. That's a drink special I can get into. Sign me up for a glass for Sibling Rivalry for $4.5! I'll be back to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Super hipster crowd here. Gotta love the exposed brick and wooden seating. Drink deals Are not the greatest but alright. I like the variety of light fixtures and cozy setup . Not much for appetizer situation. They cannot split bills, only offer cash machine that'll charge you."}
{"text":"I came to Northwood for birthday drinks and left not at all disappointed -- which was a feat considering that the running theme of my birthday for the past few years is disappointment. Northwood is the type of place that feels like it fell right out of my dreams, and it would definitely go into the regular rotation if I was local. Perfectly friendly and non-intrusive service, makes a mean cocktail, serves coffee, and open til 2:00 am? Yes please.  The time of year plus inclement weather meant that it wasn't busy when I visited, which made the atmosphere all the better for lingering over perfectly balanced cocktails. I selected the Pretty Vengeance for quaffing, and enjoyed it so much that I promptly ordered a second. If I could have torn myself away, I would have ordered one of the other delicious-sounding offerings, but there's a time and a place to stick with the tried and true (the time is your birthday, and the place is Northwood).  I will be back, even as I attempt to recreate the sweet nectar created by combining vodka, vanilla liqueur, vermouth, pear, and cardamom for home enjoyment."}
{"text":"Dinner service. Patio. Music. New website. Northwood, you go girl!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, owner is awesome. If you call a tab a \"tap\" I probably won't trust your review haha. Also if this guy hated the beans why did he ordered more bread? Such weird reviews for this place. Snacks are always great and it fills a hole in the neighborhood for a predrink spot!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the neighborhood, which used to be a bit meh. Northwood is definitely not meh. The atmosphere is conducive to productive work during the day and the Cold Brew is really choice. Five stars to Brian who handled some really delicate customers last time I was in!  Northwood has delicious & amazing cocktails. I highly recommend the Lady Grey cocktail--complete with cracked black pepper. Also Beau's Lug Tread on tap make it an even better local watering hole.   Go here, it's just what you needed."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. Relaxed atmosphere, good selection of beers, moderately priced and good music. The place is a bit heavy on the moustaches and plaid, but a good time was had by all. It's small, so if you've got a big group, get there early!"}
{"text":"Oh boy... I'm not happy writing this. Service here is how I expect war criminals to be served in heaven. (Ignored, awful)  I have been here around 20 times and around the last ten have been some of the laziest instances of service. Don't you want to come to my table and take more drink orders?? Don't you want to make money?? Sitting half an hour without a drink order on a table and no water glasses is insane and I am embarrassed to stay I stayed.  It is never very busy when I come. And having to beg for the bill only to see the bartender start cleaning tables after saying \"yes\" is creepy. It's also creepy when they only pay attention to you when they want your money. This happens all the time. Once the bill is down they're like vultures.  Good luck on the patio in the summer as you could be having a heart attack and none of the staff would notice. They would probably start cleaning tables around your dying body."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what you pay for here. Cocktails will run you $12-15 and a beer on tap is about $7-10. The drinks are pretty good though and the wait staff is courteous and friendly. Sitting at the window bar was quite nice although the place got exceptionally loud on a Tuesday evening such that I was effectively yelling by the end of the night."}
{"text":"The environment is great! Cool, dark, gorgeous brick walls and good tunes. We ordered the popcorn,  it was stale then the veg. wrap which was very dry unfortunately. The drink menu is impressive tho. We'll go back for the ambiance for sure..maybe give the food another shot"}
{"text":"Cute and cozy spot for beer, especially during the daily (!) happy hour.  One day when my beer bud and I were exploring that end of Bloor for the first time, we saw the sandwich board advertising $2 off any beer between 5 and 7. I made a mental note for us to come back. We're glad we did - we love the vibe, the decor, the service. This isn't a local for us, but we make a point of coming in for a pint when the location and timing works out. This is the first place we tried Kissmeyer on tap. A tad pricey during regular hours (we've found it for significantly less), but nice at $6.75 (before tip).  The place does fill up from 5 to 7, so be warned you might not find a table if you arrive too late or come with too many people. Some folks make this their coffee and laptop spot during the late afternoons and this spills over into happy hour. A lot of people are here for the cocktails, not the beer, so it's fun to sit at the bar and watch the concoctioneering."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and despite trying other places we end up wanting to come back! The drinks are so good! We are hooked on the amazing varieties. Black walnut! White lodge! And death and company spin offs! Wish there was more finger food though! Ambience is great as well! Low key and not pretentious! I want to go again now!!"}
{"text":"Took a half hour to be told that the \"snack\" I ordered was no longer available. Took another 15 minutes to be given something that looked like dog food and had a chefs hair in it! Yuck!"}
{"text":"The newest hipster cafe/bar/saloon to hit Bloorcourt and the first really big makeover on this block in recent years, Northwood is brand new, opening its doors yesterday. The atmosphere was really enjoyable and relaxed but then again, there was only a trickle of customers coming in and discovering the place.  If you ever entered Regal Gardens, the Chinese restaurant that pre-dated Northwood, the interior is not even recognizable in a wonderful way. They did a complete gut. The east wall is now exposed brick, a long bar on the west side featuring an eclectic cage holding all the liquor, a chalk board menu of preferred uppers and downers and a mish mash of old schoolhouse chairs, wicker bar stools, wooden benches and sturdy retro pub chairs.   It's got that nostalgic dive bar feel without the actual griminess or smell, maybe because it's only seen one night of patrons so far but I appreciate this. It's clear a lot of thought went into the place and the furnishings, which is really refreshing.  The staff are friendly, the coffee is good, the selection of sweeteners includes coconut sugar and maple sugar. I even had an enjoyable vegan cookie.   Menu and brunch to come. I was promised vegan options which is enough to win my return patronage and if it's good, make me a regular. I did not check out the liquor but hopefully they have a nice selection of local and craft beers, as places like this are inclined to.  The only drawback I saw was the extra .50c for soy-based drinks. Down with the soy tax!"}
{"text":"I came here for a Yelp event was very impressed by the nice intimate setting for a bar and the very friendly bartenders.    I had one of their cocktails called the \"Lady Grey Sour\", which was an Earl Grey rye, lemon and black pepper.  It went down very smooth.  That can be dangerous for me. Anyways, the assortment of drinks is very good and is definitely a good bar."}
{"text":"I love sitting here in the afternoon to work. The interior is so nice, the coffee is good and it's possibly my favourite local chill out place. Admittedly I haven't been here in the evening for drinks yet but the cocktail menu looks smashing.  One year later... I love this place even more."}
{"text":"I spent the better part of a day at Northwood and enjoyed it so much I wasn't even tired of being there at the end of it all. The atmosphere is great for working during the day and socializing during the evening. Seriously, this cafe covers it all.  An added bonus of being there so long means that I experienced a lot of what they have to offer, and from lattes to sparkling wine at happy hour, to cheese plates, everything I had I liked.  The menus are small, but creative and the staff is efficiently friendly. It would be one of my main hangs if I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was here a few months ago for a co-worker's birthday outing and I was pleasantly surprised that they also served coffee in the mornings.  I recognized one of the bartenders who was previously a barista at Lit Espresso Bar - Alex Castellani. Really cool guy.  Anyway, I'm seldom out in these parts of the west end, but I really enjoyed the vibe and atmosphere they provided.  The cost for booze was moderately priced - a bit more than I'm comfortable with, so I usually stick to 2 cocktails max.  Anything after that is if I'm feeling splurgy (or want to get drunk).  They've got a decent selection of wines, craft beers, liquors and cocktails sourced from all over the world.  They've also got a decent patio too if you're ever in the area and want to hit a patio to have to imbibe in their delicious libations.  If alcohol isn't your thing, they also serve coffee as well, with expertly pulled espresso based drinks from their two group Synesso espresso machine."}
{"text":"Where's Northwood, GPS?  Intersection of Plaid and Grads, with a side of Kimchi.  I stumbled inside.  I stumbled to the back.  I stumbled downstairs.    By the time my eye glasses cleared up I had landed, at the bottom.  Vintage and cosy warm, I must have slipped down a hippie rabbit hole in space/time.  No matter, I'm glad they had urinals instead of outhouses in this snow stormy weather.  I pulled myself upstairs and saw a note. Beware: slippery stairs.  Wish I had read that.  This evening I sat at the bar listening to one of my all time favourites, Milk Frothing.  I wish I had time for coffee but alas 'twas a beer-crawl and I know my limitations.  Why not take a cold-brew (http://northwoodto.ca/cold-brew/) for later? Apologies, out-of-stock.  We sat, drank, chat like Canadians at a Canadian café/bar  The end."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the bloor west hood. Impressive list of (bottled) beer and a few nice draughts. Wine list & cocktails are unique. Snacks are served (sandwiches and the like) and good coffee is part of the mantra. Possibly the best iced drip coffee i have ever tasted. No milk or sugar required!   I like when cafes are true to their name: serving both caffeine and booze in true European fashion.  The patio is lovely, as is the interior. The bathrooms are spotless and have a cozy cottage-like charm. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was meeting two of my oldest friends here for a little catch-up session, and thought \"Hey, great idea: I'll bike straight from work! It's only Bay/Bloor to Christie Pits, that's like 10 minutes. -15 is nothin'.\"  Idiot. My hands froze solid. Halfway there I kicked my chain off completely, and had to do a sidewalk pit stop to get it back on. By the time I got there, my fingers were so numb, I couldn't even get my bike lock undone. I rushed inside to defrost, and realized I couldn't get my helmet off. So there I am inside Northwood, fully clad in coat, balaclava and helmet, blowing hot air into my hands and watching my bike suspiciously in case a lunatic impervious to the cold decided to run away with it...for 10 minutes!  Relevance? The friendly bar staff made no jests at my expense. Thankfully. Though I felt shame. I finally de-iced, locked-up, my friends showed up smiling and eager for a few child-free hours (3 kids between the two of them.)  We were thrilled by the $2-Off-All-Beer deal between 5-7pm (every night!) and ordered some tall bottles of suds (I'm an 1850s prospector, consarn it.) I had a Garrisson IPA and a Chimay Blue. Both warmed me appropriately for the frosty trip home.  We also ordered some snacks! They suggested getting a few dishes, since the plates are small. This was true and good advice, but the beer was filling enough that I think we were satisfied. In any case, my Root Vegetable Winter Salad was phenomenal. Beets, carrots, rutabaga & radish, with goat cheese and sunflower seeds. My taste buds danced around the flavours like a Bill Cosby tapdance-off, and when it was over everybody won. I can't wait to try and recreate it at home (The salad, not the tapdance competition. My neighbour already passive-aggressively bangs my walls to complain about the reasonable level my GF plays Sarah McLachlan, I don't need the downstairs neighbours finding an excuse to poke at their ceiling with a Swiffer.)  Anyway, it's a great space, the cocktails are also good, and now that I know the food is good I'll be coming back more often. Not in this weather though."}
{"text":"Went here last night to do the whole online-to-real life transition with somebody from eharmony.  With a few of these sorts of meetings in my world these day, it seems like I'm really getting to know impressive places in the city to drink cocktails.  Northwood is another winner.  We sat outside on their terrific patio.  Service was excellent.  (Absolutely love it when a host and/or wait staff are observant enough to know when a table of two is a first date and then make extra effort to ensure a good/smooth time!  This has happened a couple of times and it always means an extra tip--many, many thanks!)  The interior, from what I saw, is great--seems like this place will really work in the colder months too.  The cocktail list has about 10 interesting items and I'm sure the staff can make anything under the sun.  I went with their gin and tonic.  It was a well crafted, well presented G&T but quite honestly not something I'd order again.  I prefer mine to be a bit more crisp and carbonated...maybe I'm just too used to what I made at home.    Next up was their Paper Moon which I liked better--gin based, it is very sweet and delicious.  It also has a bunch of booze in it that most people do not stock at home.  My date enjoyed her \"Faith & Fortune\".  We also got the nibbly snack basket thing.    Northwood is a great place to enjoy a drink--and a huge improvement over that old Chinese food place.  Recommended--especially for first dates!"}
{"text":"Was sitting outside and the wood table was crawling with little tiny bugs :/ had to keep shooing them away with their menu!   Other than that the drinks were food with good craft beer and wine selections. Had their Old Fashioned and the orange/ice was done right! Didn't have a chance to try their food but the atmosphere inside looked perfect for a summer night.   Friendly staff and very relaxing vibe.   Will be back :)"}
{"text":"So happy to have a new coffee shop in this area!! Especially since some around here are not as good...   I love the atmosphere and the server was so friendly and helpful.   I got a brownie with caramel and salt it was sooo good and the tea they serve is from tealish so it was also tasty.   I love that it's a coffee shop and a bar and stays open until 2am!! I mean really what more could you ask for. It really has it all.   The only issue I would say is that some of the chairs don't have backs to them which can be annoying if you go to do work. They do have some chairs with backs but just be aware!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch yesterday.  Bavette steak was satisfying, and precisely medium-rare, as requested.  Veal poutine had \"home fries\"-style pieces of potato, rather than (long, thin) french fries (which was not explicit on the menu).  This cuts down on the surface area and is sub-optimal for poutine.  It also did not have quite enough cheese, nor quite enough gravy. The veal itself was moist and tender, which, for the most part, redeemed the dish.  Pork and beef tourtiere was great (if you're into that sort of thing).  The pastry was crisp and flaky, the interior was lightly spiced, saucy, and flavorful.  There was a bit of apple sauce on the plate which provided some great complimentary sweetness and tartness.  Stack-o-flapjacks was a gratifying way to spike my blood sugar, and the bourbon maple syrup was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great place for cocktails and drinks. They have an extensive menu for cocktails, beer, wine, and other liquors and everything I tried were satisfying. The food menu is very limited so would not suggest it if you are looking for a good/full dinner. The place is dim, not too noisy, and very relaxed."}
{"text":"Northwood is a neat little bar located in an oft-looked-over part of Bloor West. It's pretty much smack dab between Bathurst and Ossington, which is probably why it took me so long to give it a try in the first place.  I really like the ambience of Northwood. It's small and very dimly lit - the perfect bait for hipsters. And you'll find hipsters galore. If you're looking for a place to get turnt up on a weeknight with your friends, you'll probably do better heading east towards Koreatown. However, if you're looking for a low-key-but-not-too-quiet place for a first date or something like that, Northwood might be the perfect place for you.  The drink menu is pretty impressive. I'm pretty sure most beer lovers, cocktail lovers, and spirit lovers will find something that fits their taste."}
{"text":"Meh. My friends were really excited to go to this place, as they had been previously and had really enjoyed themselves. Given the variety of bars in Toronto, this spot is a total take it or leave it. We were a reasonably large group and the servers didn't seem particularly interested in accommodating us even though there was a lot of space available when we arrived (and a reservation had been made) Overall, service was spotty and we were ignored after being there for awhile. Drinks were of average quality and very overpriced. I had a panini that was a bit soggy, chewy, and cold. Probably fine for one drink if you're alone or on a date."}
{"text":"GO HERE for cocktails. The list is super long, and the staff is very helpful. The ambience is cute & cozy. Great for week-night cocktails after work.  The food / snacks are OK. I'm a vegetarian and have ordered the white bean dip. The dip is really smooth with a great crunch on top with the addition of various seeds. The dipping vessel it comes with is a thin, gluten free crepe-ish bread which was also delicious."}
{"text":"Our server at the Crafty Coyote recommended Northwood to us. I had two cocktails - a Hot Toddy and a Violet Hour cocktail. The Violet Hour was the best tequila cocktail I have ever had. There were many cocktails to choose from and will definitely be back again for more."}
{"text":"There are already too many photos here of cocktails rested near laptops, so I'll spare you. What I love most about Northwood is that it's a daytime cafe that smoothly transitions into a bar.  So if you want to come here around, say, 2pm, and work away on your laptop with, say, a cocktail instead of a coffee (or a cocktail *with* coffee in it), who's to judge...  The place is clearly designed for the academic and creative-industry crowd, who make up the majority of its patrons. They have a wicked cocktail menu and a great atmosphere -- that rare balance between casual and classy, with an expected hipster crowd but no obnoxious behaviour. The staff are attentive but not intrusive. I come here at least once a week to catch up with a friend or to write on my own while sipping a drink. It's my favourite bar, and I don't even live near its neighbourhood.  The LADY GREY SOUR cocktail is probably their signature drink, is excellent, and is exactly as it's described. But my favourite is STORM BREWING, which is a twist on the classic Dark & Stormy with a clever addition of their in-house cold brew coffee. This drink is definitely not for everyone, but it's layered and unexpected in all the right ways. When their experienced bartender(s) make it, it's brilliant. However, they seem to have a fairly steady bartender turnover, and many of their secondary bartenders make a poor and disappointing version (either far too sour or using flattened ginger beer). If you're really feeling adventurous, try the Black Lodge cocktail, but for me the combination of tequila, cold brew, agave sweetness, and egg white proteins is all wrong and totally undrinkable. They had some other amazing cocktails in the winter, and I'm looking forward to them switching the menu up again.  So, if I can't stop coming to this awesome bar, why only 4 stars? First: the uneven drink preparation. I never thought much about the importance of \"mixology\" until coming here over the course of 8+ months and noting the really wide variety of quality in the drinks. For instance, in the winter, I used to order the Vieux Carre cocktail, which is difficult to balance well and *demands* top-notch ingredients. When one of the owners (or whom I imagine to be a key bartender, at the least) makes it, he takes great care and tries the drink, sometimes adjusting to get it right. The last time I attempted to order it, with a different bartender, it tasted way off and the rye whiskey itself was poor quality. When I mentioned to the bartender that it doesn't balance as well as always, she gave me a puzzled expression and said \"but it's such an easy one, I just poured whatever it said in the recipe.\" [easy one? it has 6 components...]  I realize I might be more picky than most, but a great cocktail menu (at great-cocktail prices, no less) deserves better.  Second, the food here is not good, at all. I think they're still trying to work out their kitchen, and I get the sense that the owners' heart isn't in the culinary side as much as the beverages.  Don't come here hungry and don't plan to eat.  It's a cafe/bar and it's totally amazing at doing just that."}
{"text":"Really wished this place was around when I worked in the Bloor & Shaw area. The last time I walked by this location it was a questionable Chinese restaurant. I couldn't help but notice there's something much better going on when I strolled by the other day.  I could sense it was a coffee shop when I walked in based on the amount of people clicking away on their laptops. I figured I would rest my feet at the bar and have my fourth cup of coffee that day. I looked around to see if there was a menu and grabbed their clipboard -- it listed all the fancy coffees they make, but thankfully they had three edible options at the bottom. I opted for the ham & swiss sandwich.  Americano was good. Girl working there was friendly, and the decor was quite nice. It's not a unique experience with lots of wood & black paint (similar to Beaconsfield or Churchill) but I appreciated the effort in making the place comfortable. Quite a bit of time passed since I finished my drink and I was wondering if my sandwich was coming or not. I was actually about to pack up and forget about it, but then a dude finally came with what turned out to be a rather delicious hot snack. Maybe not worth the six-plus dollars it cost (though it came with grapefruit which I skipped) but I was still satisfied.  Would really like to see some more snacks. Even maybe just some baked goods like muffins or cookies. I realise it's also probably a rocking bar at night, but if it's going to do the coffee shop vibe in the morning/afternoon I would like to have a little more variety. I would have killed for some soup."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee place. Great oatmeal raisin cookies"}
{"text":"The extensive variety of cocktails on the Northwood menu makes it hard to choose!  I tried two cocktails from the Spirit-driven section:  the Royal Oak and the Normandy.  Both were exquisitely crafted and full-flavoured.  The menu also offers some interesting beers.  The vibe is cozy and the service is friendly and attentive.  A great place for a casual evening with your mates."}
{"text":"Every time I return to Toronto this is my first stop for a gorgeous cocktail. The real deal. Best on the block. Homemade bitters, aged cider, crafts beers & a ton more & my favourite the Choupette - elderflower, lemon, thyme and gin. The snack menu is pretty yummy too, I usually go for the plate of pickled veg.  The space is super cool yet romantic. Percect for a date or hang. They've usually got a great DJ spinning too.  During the day, the coffee is aces and the space is a dream for getting work done."}
{"text":"We went here with a group of close friends after getting married at city hall. They set up a cozy table for us in the back, we had the most wonderful time :) Everyone loved everything, the cocktails, the beer, the wine selection, the atmosphere. We've all been back many times since .... I think we've almost tried every cocktail on the menu by now."}
{"text":"Nice place with a fantastic atmosphere, assuming you don't mind the indifferent, hipster staff that work here (which in turn attracts a largely hipster crowd).  Drink selection is great though and worth a visit.  Patio is being worked on now and should be open any day."}
{"text":"Northoods brings a decent bar to an area of Toronto that has somehow been devoid of good bars, although it's an awesome place if you like kimchi and soon tofu.  The DRINKS:  --BEER: They have a pretty extensive bottle list, all at rather high mark-ups, 3-4 times LCBO prices.  They have a decent but not amazing draft list.  Lots of focus on Beau's, which is one of the weaker Ontario breweries.  I was astonished to drink a tasty, but standard-production Beau's for $9.50/pint.  Woah, that's crazy-town pricing.  Thankfully, happy hour made it normal for $2 off, but there's no excuse to price a standard non-barrel aged American pale ale like that.  --COCKTAILS:  They have a good cocktail list and apparently a pretty diverse set of ingredients.  I ordered the Vieux Carre, a cocktail I had been looking for here for a while, but it unfortunately was underwhelming.  The flavors were off, fairly watered down...I think the server/bartender/everything else was harried, so I think it spent some time sitting in ice. I also think the vermouth was low quality...not the nice richness that helps balance this drink of say a carpano antica.  This cocktail is also made with 1.5 oz of liquor...for a drink with no mixer, that's but one shot (and at $11).  Maybe that's why they felt so compelled to water it down to make it look presentable in a glass.  The FOOD:  Very limited menu!  Just a few sandwiches...didn't try.  The SERVICE:  Very good when it was available.  When we were there it was pretty full and it seemed like one guy was doing all the waitering, cocktail making, and beer pouring.  He was super friendly and knowledgeable when you had his attention, but we mostly didn't have attention.  On the whole, this place is too expensive for what's on offer.  Not going to rush back."}
{"text":"Really loved this warm, friendly spot on Bloor near Christie Pits Park.  I came here with friends on a warm summer evening. By 8 p.m. the patio was full, but there were plenty of seats inside.  We stayed through the evening enjoying beers and conversation. The place got full, but never terribly crowded. Inside the decor and ambiance are tasteful and inviting.  The staff here are friendly and knowledgeable. They have an extensive selection of draught and bottled beers. I also hear that they do amazing cocktails. Maybe next time! Northwood is definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"The owner has Phd in Film.... no wonder the lighting is sensational! I've never seen better lighting in a bar.   Specialty cocktails are great. Lady Grey Sour... original and tasty.  Yogi Berra might say... \"Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded\". The last time I walked by, I wanted to stop in, but it was kind of packed."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here, but the drinks & service were outstanding on a busy Saturday night for a very large group. They were attentive, personable and spot on. Great vibe. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Overall not worth it. I did enjoy the environment and set-up but menu was disappointing. For an appetizer I did order hummus and what I got in return was a few dozen seasoned garbanzo beans. And the chai latte was bland, it couldn't even wash out the bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"cozy, dim.  too dim? booze bottles caged at the bar both brick and black walls  staff is attentive friendly and hospitable just A+ service  extensive beer list mostly bottles, a few taps many cocktails too  sandwiches, snacks, sweets all of which i've never tried i just go for drinks  sipping on cold brew i could spend all evening here one of my go-to's"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a friend for a drink in between other stops on our route on a Friday night. Obviously with such great reviews, we were looking forward to coming to Northwood.  We walked in and it was very dark inside. No problem though, it was nighttime and it's a bar so the lighting was acceptable. Actually, this would be a GREAT place to bring someone when you're either not looking so hot or the person you're with isn't looking so hot!  Anyway... The place was full when we walked in. All tables and bar stools were occupied but the guy behind the bar motioned to an empty table at the back and so we sat there.   A server came to our table promptly with a menu. When she returned to take our order, my friend was in the washroom. I ordered a dubbel ($9) (so glad this beer is so often on drink menus now), and I told the server that my friend would order when she returned to her seat.  Our server brought my drink along with a bottle of water and two glasses. My friend was still checking the menu.  The server never returned... NEVER.   I finished my beer and she hadn't even come by again ONCE!  We decided that since the service sucked we'd be on our way. I put $12 (a 10 and a twoonie) on the table to cover my beer+tax+tip. After we were walking down the street, my friend handed me the twoonie I had left. She said she took it because the server didn't deserve it. I actually felt pretty bad because that meant I was actually 17 cents short on the actual bill with tax. I was then a little embarrassed that I ended up being short, but whatever.  Anyway, I'm sure this place is great with a different server. I'd totally come back, pay my amount owing from my first visit and leave an appropriate tip on whatever I had during my return. (I just wouldn't bring a friend who might reclaim my tip money!)  Even though the place was busy, the crowd was a little tame. Everyone was seated so my first impression was that this is more of a date place. (Actually, as far as ambiance, it reminded me a bit of Bar Volo).  So yeah, the poor rating is really just based on the service, which was as I mentioned: non-existent.  That said, I totally want to go back.  And if anyone from Northwood is reading this... I'm seriously really sorry about being 17-cents short! (Not so sorry my friend scammed the tip as it wasn't really deserved anyway)."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks after Karaoke and they had an excellent selection of cocktails and other late night drinks. The atmosphere was great and the bartenders were very knowledgeable and friendly. It's a very chilled out spot with fun loungey music that makes it feel very intimate. Don't come here expecting to dance or be rowdy, it's not that type of crowd."}
{"text":"Not your everyday \"mix a drink from a cocktail book\" place. They have their own creations like black walnut cocktail. Try this little gem!"}
{"text":"Walked in to this bar by chance and was thoroughly impressed. Emily was a charming host and made me feel like this was my local pub. The cocktails were delicious and proportioned to maximize strength without compromising taste. 10/10 would try again."}
{"text":"Finally! A place where I can drink high quality tea while my boyfriend can drink high quality booze   Sweet concept for sure"}
{"text":"Northwood is a gem. The drinks are fun, the atmosphere is cozy and the rotating list of food is always interesting. Plus, the fact that it serves tasty coffee and snacks during the day is just great.  Only disappointments: it tends to get packed with hipsters later in the night, and the NYE dinner was overpriced and not at all memorable. I think the quality of the food really depends on who's cooking/catering, and the staff seem much more used to bar tending than serving tables. But all in all, I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Toronto gets it. At least its nightlife industry gets it. This is yet another golden lit, dark-walled, laid back, approachable bar that says, 'hither, but where else is there the cackle of drunken kids, heartwarming thirtysomethings and comedic snarling trios of women along with shots of fernet, and a casual, open enough space for anyone who isn't interested in drinking?\"   It could be the fact that I hail from the land of more bars per capita than most places but somehow most bars are packed, and I have the feeling I've seen it all... but, from an outsider's perspective... the approachability of a bar is more important than anything else, and Northwood gets the point: there's no fucking curtain, there's no hostess ready to say no, and there's no line. There are chairs outside in case you want to wait for a better seat... there's standing room inside. There's low tables, bench tables and a bar. Service was massively attentive and casual. Table service through the night with plenty of water top offs.   And, with the fernet on the menu that can be slung back or taken a nip off of... this place is like an alternatively better version of many hideouts in SF. People in Canada are nicer. The drinks are cheaper. And there's more leg room."}
{"text":"Coffee was fine but waiters are slow and kind of too cool for school. Nice decor and selection though."}
{"text":"It's hard to imagine this placed once house a chinese restaurant selling shit on a tray.   The owners of Northwood have transformed it into a cafe-cocktail lounge, doing random pop up dinners every so often, and real cocktails at night. I'm very appreciative that they serve cocktails the traditional way, with blocks of ice to ensure your drink doesn't get watered down. At $10 a cocktail, it's very reasonable for the two ounce pour delicious tasting mixed drinks Their 10th & Arch (bourbon, maple syrup base is delicious on so many levels. The Lady Grey Sour was very unique to say the least. Also, they carry a great selection of beers and some that i didn't even know were still brewed (when was the last time you say anyone actually carry Stroh in Toronto).   The place does get packed fast, and it's gaining popularity fast. So be prepared for that and arrive early."}
{"text":"Restaurant was out of several kinds of food and beer. Had no sides for our meals and served a sandwich with no sauce. One of the sandwiches also has the wrong ingredients. Pretty bad spot lol."}
{"text":"Richard P from Northwood is now messaging me trying to convince me of the benefits of their 'tab' system.  See my previous review, it does not work. He says its hard to do separate bills and a lot of work for servers and customers (huh?!)...so they don't want to do it. I wonder how all those other restaurants do it? Magic? Actually when you do split bills its so nice and easy for the customer and we love it!! For now I'll continue to avoid this place at all costs.  Richard P's private messages to me explicitly told me that they do NOT do separate bills. They do allow you to try and calculate what you owe on the one bill that you receive, but that is NOT a separate bill. He also\" justified\" to me in previous messages why northwood doesn't do separate bills,  so I'm not sure what his comment to my review even means. Regardless, I will never return after the rude service I received. As the server at the last restaurant I went to told me \"of course I can do separate bills for you, and any place that says they can't is lying or has severely outdated equipment\"   If anyone wants clarification on what was sent to me, feel free to pm me! :)"}
{"text":"Really great bar with a cool atmosphere and drinks to match. Always a really good atmosphere here at the weekends. The bartenders are great for helping with recommendations. It's very cosy and intimate. I lived right beside this bar in Toronto so I went all the time and now I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I wish I owned some kind of share in this place that allowed me to always have a table here.   Living around the corner I've spent a few years finishing a bottle of wine with friends and facing the dark options of a Bloor West selection of bars whose zenith was Pour Boy's (yeah there's Piston or 3 Speed but..I dunno. We never jived.)   Now instead of walking into decades of burps and sad old zoo cougars, we get to hop over to Northwood; fresh paint and friendship.   It's a comfy and beautiful spot, and the drinks are priced up but not high (a single Fernet with lemon was $5.60, for example).   Daytime:  My boyfriend and I came in here for the first time mid-morning, and had really pleasant espressos looking out on Christie Pits in the sunny front window.   Crowd: I know it's hard for some to hear, but \"hipsters\" are just people under 35 with a shred of whimsy.   Conclusion: The world is great and I love it."}
{"text":"Wicked bar with a mind boggling cocktail menu. Maybe the best ive seen, cocktail wise. The level of creativity is extremely on point, to say the least. Service was mind boggling also. On point service and on point cocktail menu = one thing .... Wait for it .... Killer date spot to say the least.  Ok, so I wasn't on a date (just bein' honest) but next time ive got one lined up i wonder where I'll be taking my special someone?? Hmm. Let me think about that for a second. bellwoods brewery? Nah. burdock? Fuck no. I'm going to northwood on bloor street west. Bingo!  Did I mention that they also have a patio? holy hell. Give me a break northwood! That's wicked.  4/5 stars overall. It would be a 5/5 if it wasn't absurdly expensive and also the crowd is like 95% tech industry power couples so ya 4/5"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my time here on a Friday night. It was just busy enough and there was a great vibe inside, with a perfect soundtrack of old school hip-hop beats. I had the No. 9 (Dark as Night, Sweet as Sin -- $12) and the No. 8 (7 1/2 Floor -- $9) cocktails, and both were EXCELLENT. I was particularly fond of the No. 8, which was on the sweeter end as far as cocktails go, and went down nice and easy. There was also a late night snacks menu on offer, and although I didn't have the chance to sample any of the food, I was intrigued by the options ranging from Agedashi Tofu to Beef Sam.   Half the place has more of a cafe feel, with a lovely exposed brick wall, and the bar side feels a little bit \"grungier\" and more industrial. Looking forward to returning again soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my own main haunts on Bloor West. The cocktails are awesome, the ambiance is wonderful for meeting up with friends, and I'm really happy that they've recently expanded their food offerings. Check out the rotating weekly dinner specials, I've eaten on my own a few times and also have dined with friends. I went for dinner with a party of four with mixed dietary needs (one vegan & g/f, one g/f omnivore, two omnivores who will eat anything) and we all walked away happy and well fed. That night I loved the pickle plate, beet tartare (yes beets!), the white bean dip, and some perfectly cooked brussel sprouts. As for the cocktails, I'm a gin drinker and love the Paper Moon, the Paradis is also quite nice."}
{"text":"After seeing this place pop up on Yelp and being featured in a newsletter/blog that I follow I decided to give these guys a try. They're only a 10 minute walk from my house so I thought this would be a great opportunity to find a new brunch spot close to home. I popped in Saturday morning with my girlfriend only to find out that they're doing brunch on Sundays only at the moment.  No matter, I grabbed a tea to go, of which I had 4 choices of loose leaf varieties to choose from. The woman working was very friendly and explained how they're taking things one step at a time and slowly introducing more and more.   Right now this is a great place to hang out during the day to grab a hot beverage and chit-chat with a friend or come in the evening for a cocktail or two. No open Wifi networks popped up during my visit so this may not be the place at the moment to hang out if you're trying to get work done/being a laptop hobo."}
{"text":"Bar Crawl #1:  Beau's Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale & St Bernardus Abt 12  Happy Hour Everyday till 7 pm! $2 off drafts and bottles/cans. Sweet!  Of course I have to start off with a pint: Beau's Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale ($5.50 with HH specials!) and my Yelp friend with a can of Howe Sound Lager ($4.5 with HH Special). And of course if you prefer some exquisite import: A bottle of St Bernardus Abt 12 ($28).  The interior is dark, dim and cozy. I like how Northwood is a coffee/beer/cocktail drinking place as that means I can hang out here the whole day.   Too bad they were out of the 8oz Cold Brew to go. I guess I have to come back soon to try out their cocktails and coffee! And free WIFI!! Oh that means I can even yelp a bit!"}
{"text":"Good cocktails and service. The plumbing pipe held toilet paper holder for the loo in the basement at this bar.  If it were earlier and warmer, a cocktail with cold brew coffee would have sit just right (ugh early morning tomorrow)."}
{"text":"Northwood is a true Jack of all trades, and a master of all of them. Its the kind of place you can show up at three in the afternoon for coffee and laptop time, chat with friends over a cheeseboard, and transition smoothly into cocktails once the sun starts to set. The servers are chill, friendly, and on top of things, and the food and drinks they're serving up are always on point. Plus its dang cute - from the big windows bringing in great natural light in the daytime, to the candle lights at night, to the art deco covers on the menus. Maybe not the place for a huge dinner, but certainly the place for light bites, drinks, and an all around good time. And if they happen to be playing host to Shelix and her drag queen bingo night (called \"Hey girl! Bingo!\"), well that's just fabulous."}
{"text":"My favourite bar in our hood! So happy to have this place close to our home. Great craft beers as well as yummy fresh cocktails, and the snacks were great, too! The cocktails are $12-16 range, which is fair compared to other cocktail bars like this downtown. Oh, and great patio for the summer! YAY!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good snacks, great alcohol list, and love that you can order non-alcoholic drinks into the wee night: lattes, hot chocolates etc."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best cocktail bars and cafes in town. If you are looking for a place to have a great drink and great conversation, don't miss out on Northwood  My personal favourite is their cocktails with coffee in them. You can have it in the late afternoon and get re-energized. If you are looking for food, this is not the place to go for. Snacks are good but not food food."}
{"text":"I am far too old and grumpy to put up with wobbly chairs and tables, overpriced cocktails and a ridiculous menu. The staff seemed to hate their jobs while we were there. I get it. I have hated serving tables too.  I really think that this place is best for a burgeoning young relationship where you aren't eating anyway and are trying to impress your date with how sophisticated you are."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with the variety of cocktails Northwood had in their menu. Since I like bourbon and cognac, I finally settled for the Tiki Old Fashioned (yes that's what it was called). It had that blended deepness of cognac with a citrus finish. Definitely a drink only for those that like hard liquor. I'm glad that the bartender was nice enough to describe  the differences and particulars about each drink as I doubt any first timers like myself would know which cocktail to best order.   Meanwhile, my friends also enjoyed there drinks but I don't remember the drink names (see pics for parts of their drink menu).   Northwood is a cozy and chill bar to try unique cocktails and catch up with friends. Try to go earlier as I heard that it can get really packed by late evening. Cheers!"}
{"text":"So my last update was a little off. They have stopped with the oysters, and the patio isn't in full swing, but...  They have done some pop-up menus with varying chefs, but it looks like they've got some keepers for supper hour and they aren't messing around. Get some of their delish delights (think: tortiere, pea soup with biscuits and braised beef poutine) to go with your craft cocktails and reasonably priced wine and beer. Mmm K?"}
{"text":"Wonderful cocktails, very average food but would go back just for the beverage list. Cheese was strange and quite stale, other apps were pretty tasteless. Much too dark a spot!"}
{"text":"Sick atmosphere and sexy chemists synthesizing seductive solutions."}
