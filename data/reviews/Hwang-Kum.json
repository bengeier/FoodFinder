{"text":"After seaching for so long for good and authentic Korean food, this is the place! Small and cute restaurant! Food was excellent! (kim chi, gyoza, beef strip and bibimbap) Service was good! ( a bit slow but reasonable) Very busy restaurant (in&out constant) Price = $$ **Need to bring booster for kids"}
{"text":"We got the seafood pancake and potato pork stew. The portion of the pancake was big, but it tasted super great, even when it's cold, it still tasted sweet because of the carrots. The pork stew was not as good as i imagined . But it was still ok. I will go back again to try the spicy octopus and pork feet."}
{"text":"Small space. Excellent food. Understaffed, as there was only one waitress on a very busy Thursday night. The selection of soups was large and the meat well marinated! A good sign is when, even after a good full meal, you look at other patrons' plates and decide that that's what you're going to order next time!"}
{"text":"I swear by Korean cold noodles when the temperature rises over a pit-drenching 30 degrees not including humidity. When my style is crapped and am unable to ride with the windows down and the sunroof open, then it's way too hot. Ask for the spicy mustard sauce; it's a mix of dijon and vinegar that adds a completely different level of awesomeness to this cold noodle dish. That sauce is usually used for another cold soup noodle dish, but it works with this one as well.  If you noticed, Korean cuisine is all about textures in bite and complimenting and contrasting flavors. Some people might be apprehensive of such a party-pack of flavors, but you'll just have to try. If you're courageous, then take a dive off the deep end and challenge your comfort zone and try something new. You never know, you might like it... Unlike my nephew who only eats chicken nuggets, french fries and my mom's egg fried rice."}
{"text":"Food: Hwang Kum thank you for not disappointing me, I've heard from you since the ages of caveman, only in good. I was very susceptible for you being one of those over-hyped places where I would leave empty and sad after the meal. But no! you became one of my top ones after this visit. The seafood pancake is definitely one of the best I've eaten in MTL, thick but crispy, abundant in green onions and seafood, only hearing the grizzling noise that it was making on the hot plate was already an enjoyable experience. The banchan were also varied and flavorful (on the salty side) and the stew was full of Korean spice, perfect dish to warm you up on a winter day~  Service: The staff were calm and efficient despite this place being crowded~  Price: Good quality/quantity-price ratio  Ambiance: The place is tiny, tiny and... tiny?! Everyone piled up like sardines almost, and the long wait at nighttime. But we don't care, the food rules!"}
{"text":"It's not the first time they've done this. Never again. Not opened on Thursday night. What kind of restaurant doesn't open at a Thursday night? And my partner paid parking first then we walked there found out it's not open. Called and no answer no voicemail. Called two days later the Saturday at dinner hour and still no answer. If they went on vacation at least you can put a sign on your door. Obviously they don't care about your patronage and I will not go all the way cross town to give money to someone who doesn't need it and mocks you when you give it to them."}
{"text":"We love this resto! its small & cozy!! the prices used to be better.. but now got a bit pricier! well all restos have no choice but to raise their prices b/c it costs a lot more for them to buy their products!!! but the food is 1 of the best in Mtl!!!  It is definitely worth it!   Try the seafood pancake!! its thick.. completely different from the other korean restos!! we always order that & the bibimbop!!   btw.. there's usually a line up.. more difficult if you are a big group!!"}
{"text":"The best korean restaurant I've been to. Delicious food, small place but nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Despite their food are really good, tasty, and korean authentic, I will not give a fully 5 stars mainly because their opening hours are not accurate. They basically open whenever they feel like to and also you should always call before heading there to make sure they are open. Moreover, you shouldn't expect great services, they don't really pay attention to you when it gets super busy. Otherwise, I must say their food is a must try!"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean restaurants in Montreal! We keep coming back for the pajuns. It's relatively small, so arrive early or be prepared to wait a bit, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Korean restaurant in Montreal! Their lunch special are delicious and fairly priced at 15$. Try their bulgogi, its so good!"}
{"text":"Delicious sums this place up.  It is a small restaurant, so there can be a bit of a wait for seating-- but it is worth the wait.  Try the bibimbap and seafood pancake-- though note the seafood pancake is best if you are there in a group, because it is a lot for two people."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and worth the wait. And yes. Be ready to wait as this place is small. The staff was accommodating and quick despite a very busy Saturday. Seafood pancake and kimchi pork with tofu were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Korean food we've had outside of Korea. Some of the stuff we've eaten there we didn't think we'd taste again.  The service is fast and attentive."}
{"text":"When I walked in this place,I am surprised by  the decoration. They gived the side dishes are amazing?Although I went there for the seafood pancake that is super crispy, there are still too much flour. I prefer the spicy cold noodle that is mixed with the special chilli sauce and vegetables?But it's a little pricey than I thought?"}
{"text":"Really good Korean restaurant! Best seafood pancake ever! They are so thick!!! We love the gam jiang tang and the beef ribs!! Even the side dishes are so good!"}
{"text":"Will definitely return. Seafood pancake, braised pork jarret and ramen noodle soup served in a large hot pot are highly recommended. Better go on a Tuesday or Wednesday by avoiding the peak dinner hours. Tiny restaurant that accommodates around 20-25 people if seated comfortably."}
{"text":"Our favourite Korean restaurant! Everything is so tasty and worth every penny. A must for any foodie!"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate at Hwang Kum in Notre-Dâme-de-Grâce. A bit out of the way of downtown but definitely worth the detour! This small Korean restaurant works on the basis of first-come-first-served but the waiting is not extensively long.   We had their signature MOST FLUFFIEST PAJEON EVER! In Kim Chi or Sea Food  I would definitely go back: To try their new items (I think I saw spicy octopus) Anyday just for their pajeon Hwang Kum is best for: Small groups and families of 2-4 people Better-than-your-regular (home) Korean meal (and therefore a bit more expensive too)  Full review: http://seizonal.com/2015/03/05/so-fluffy-i-could-die-at-hwang-kum/"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've lived in NDG for 6 years and only discovered this restaurant a couple months ago and thank Christ for it. It's really satisfying cuisine. The flavours range from sweet to spicy and it's really comforting food that doesn't fill you up too much. The spicy BBQ chicken and pork bulgogi are delicious and the seafood pancake comes out sizzling and is a great appetizer or side. The staff is nice, the food is tasty, it's decently priced and offers a wide range of authentic Korean food. I've taken to ordering for take out as well and it's quickly becoming one of my favourite places in ndg."}
{"text":"Love this place. Humble and genuine in both appearance and flavor. Consistently excellent. It is the real deal and worth the drive."}
{"text":"Cozy, good service, good food kept warm in clay bowls or iron plates."}
{"text":"Always surprising me that during the opening hour still not open. Waste time! If you decide to eat here, you would better call them first to make sure it is open or not! Tricky restaurant! Absolutely no responsibility to the customers."}
{"text":"If you come here, you HAVE to try their seafood pancake. It's so crispy and flavorful and the sauce that comes with it compliments it perfectly. As for the other food, I find it a bit pricey. The soon dubu jigae is half the size compared to other places so there isn't much in there. The side dishes are pretty good.   Everytime I come here there's a line up so be prepared for that.   The service is pretty fast and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Korean food modified for standard Montreal palate(sweet/salty/little heat). Better choices if you want authentic tastes"}
{"text":"You gotta go there and try their seafood pancake! So tasty ! And also the pork belly BBQ, the meat is so tender and juicy and so flavourful at the same time! I wish I can go there more often! My favourite Korean restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Montreal for 11 years, and I have always  choosen this restaurant to introduce Korean food to anyone who haven't tried it. I give 4 stars for this restaurant for the one and the only reason that this restaurant's opening hours are unpredictable. Every year the restaurant closes for 2-3 weeks randomly (Usually Dec-Feb) because the owner goes on a vacation?. About 3 times so far I stood at the door of the closed restaurant with frustration. Seafood pancake and beef ribs are strongly recommended choices."}
{"text":"Tasty food, cozy place, good service. Not super cheap but good quality eats! I especially enjoyed the spicy chicken."}
{"text":"MUST TRY SEAFOOD PANCAKE. It is in fact the best seafood pancake I had in Montreal korean restaurants. The only one able to make it crispy and not soggy! The other dishes on the menu are alright. Recently, the prices increased, and it became a bit too expensive... I'd come here once every year or two to have their seafood pancake, but not my go to korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh.  I managed to come here once on a Friday night and waited an hour before getting a seat.  Food took forever, and service was spotty.  The dining room is hot and crowded.  The appetizer dishes were stingy and not that great.  Couldn't even get a water refill throughout the entire dinner.  I've tried to come here several other times but twice they were closed out of the blue, and whenever I try to call ahead they don't pick up.  These people don't seem terribly interested in running this business so I'm not giving them mine."}
{"text":"PROS: 1. Food is AUTHENTIC KOREAN, Hallelujah!!! O:-) Everything ordered was delicious and served in a Korean manner. They serve side dishes.  2. Decor is very cute, homey and warm.   CONS: 1. Service is shaky. Wait time was long and we werent served water at the beginning.   OVERALL: -Finally found a Montreal Korean resto i would recommend without hesitation. Go!  Ps theyre closed sundays and mondays i believe..."}
{"text":"Pros: Food is great, nice ambiance Cons: Very small, sometimes have to wait for a seat outside in the cold. Pricey, we were 4 people cost us 200$ with tip; no desert. Waiters not much help deciphering the menu; your pretty much on your own. I'm giving it 3 stars as opposed to 2 because the food was so darn good."}
{"text":"Great cozy restaurant! Great food! Try the seafood crepe!"}
{"text":"Just went there for dinner with my companion last week.  We ordered the octopus, beef and vegetable stew for 2 person, which comes to $40.  Kind of expensive for Korean food.  When the stew first came out, I didn't think we could finish it but we did finish it to the last drop.  It's almost like a hot pot.  The broth was sweet, spicy and delicious.  I digged right in.  Perfect for warming up cold bodies in the winter season.  The only cons about this place are that it's a bit small and service is kind of slow.  I had to ask for my glass of water a 2nd time before I get it.  Overall it's a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Price is super reasonable, the food is so yummy!  We absolutely liked the spicy chicken dish, and the caviar rice bowl (bunch of veggies in there too, and I like veggies).  Will love to come back on a regular basis if I have the time to."}
{"text":"We ordered the pajeon it was thick, fluffy, generous on sea food and veggies. We had the spicy galbi, pretty good too, and the bibimbap which was also good, but so is it at any korean restaurant! It is a bit more pricy than other restaurants but still delicious."}
{"text":"I came here for the Lunch special and all I can say is that you get your money's worth and it is one of the most authentic Korean experiences.The pickled vegetables are a great appetizer ,it was my first time tasting pickled sweet potato and it was yummy.The portions are reasonable and the beef bulgogi was the perfect combo of sweet and salty.The owners are still working there and seem to really care about the service they render,always a good sign"}
{"text":"This is now officially my favourite Korean restaurant in town! Seafood pancake is a must-try just as everyone else said. I also recommend the white beef soup (made from beef bones.) Cold noodle tasted great too, ginseng chicken soup didn't reach my expectation but still okay. It's a small restaurant so I say go early to avoid the waiting line. However, their opening hours are not entirely accurate! We went on Tuesday at 6pm but it's closed with no one answering the phone. I believe I'm not the first one pointing out this problem and it is the only reason why I did not give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Didn't realize it was closed on Sundays, we planned to have dinner here for 2 Sundays continuously, but we were finally here! Was not disappointed and food is really good although the price is little bit pricey. A deducted one star is for the meh service."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. The biggest drawback is that they don't open until 6pm most days and we have a three year old, so coming here is a guaranteed late bedtime for our daughter. As far as I can tell, it's the best Korean food I've had in Montreal. I've had better in Toronto, but this place is still great. Seafood pancake is the guaranteed win of the night."}
{"text":"As a fellow Montrealer who moved to Toronto few years ago, I've been trying unsuccessfully to come back for nearly 2 years. As good as their food is, this place seems to be opened at random hours, even after I confirmed via phone that they will be opened. I first called asking if they are opened on Dec 24 and understandably they are closed. I called again asking about Dec 23 and got confirmation that they will open at 6pm. Got there aat 8pm due to a delayed flight and they said they are closed.   As another reviewer mentionned, no matter how good your food is, please respect your opening hours and your clients."}
{"text":"After long realizing that I haven't yet to experience Korean in Montreal,my friend's Korean craving became a friday night dinner for 2 but ordering for 6. haha  As a suggestion to us from a couple of people here, we checked out this little NDG establishment (when I say little we're talking like one tiny restaurant). I had just awoken from an 18 hour nap (I've been in an anemic tiredness that I can't seem to shake) so this was my breakfast.  We arrived to a line-up of about 10 people ahead of us, Personally this just peaked my interest even more!  It took about half an hour to seat us, and during that time, we just observed everyone's orders and took in the delicious smells. Th restaurant seats about 30 people total, with 3 two seaters and 6 four seaters, by the time we did sit down, we were starving! To my disappointment, they don't serve tea in the summertime, which seemed odd, but I made do with cold water.  We ordered: Dumplings, Seafood Pajeon (a pancake with seafood and veggies), spicy BBQ chicken, and Bibimbap (rice beef veggies, tofu, egg in a super hot stone bowl).  Going into this we knew we weren't going to finish it, but we decided that leftovers were a must.   The meal comes with the complimentary side dishes:  Sookju Namul - marinated bean sprouts (cold) Oijangajji muchim - pickled cucumbers Gamja Jorim - Korean potato salad Dongchimi - Kim Chi Radish Kim Chi - Cabbage  All delish!  The dumplings were super meaty, and although I've had better dumplings these were good. Not oversteamed, or dry. The Pajeon was excellent, the squid was tender not chewy, and it was very dense. The Bibimbap, was really flavourful and tasty, but I did want the rice to be able to really crisp up on the side of the stone bowl, which didnt happen. The BBQ chicken, was oerfect amount of spicy, and also went awesome with the white rice.   The total for our meal (no beverages) was $61 and we had enough to last another meal and a half each. Overall pleased with my first foray into Korean here in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I really don't even want to give it 3 stars. We came in at 7:47 PM last night and there was a party of two ahead of us and then us, also a party of two. We waited literally 25 minutes in the narrow doorway and literally nobody ever spoke to us.  It was super crowded mind you, but it wasn't until I walked all the way in that noticed there was two empty two seat tables....  So everyone finally gets to sit. It wasn't until we had literally been in the restaurant for over an hour that we finally got to order and another 40 minutes before we would eat.   My partner got the spicy noodle soup that she swears vehemently taste just like a certain brand of Japanese instant soup she likes.  I got the beef & rice in a clay pot. Having lived in a very Korean part of China (Dalian) most of my adulthood I was super disappointed.  It was bland, no real flavor past the egg and there was nothing spicy about the sauce. I was super disappointed especially given the fact that I waited under the impression that it worth the wait...that was unfortunately not the case  And anyways... $40 for two people with no alcohols (or drinks of any kind!) or appetizers is a bit much!! We both ended up snacking by bed time :("}
{"text":"Prices raised by 30%. What was a solidly priced small restaurant, has joined the ranks of Montreal's legion of over-priced modest establishments. Only to be topped by Montreal's long list of $40 for two, bacon and eggs and filter coffee breakfast rip offs ..."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean restaurant in Montreal. All the dishes are flavourful and delicious. Don't be surprised if you have to stand in line for a bit before sitting down, space is limited. Try the conch salad and the seafood pancakes, oh and the marinated kalbi too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites, but as of the last 2 times I went, the food was a bit of a miss.  Not as solid as it was the previous 3 times I'd been.  There is a lineup so if you're planning to get seats, make sure you go early!!! We had to wait about 30 min for 2 people on a Friday night.  My favorite was the beef rib soup--great for a chilly day."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with my brother and ordered the Gimbap and Bibimbap!  Nothing is nicer on a cold winter evening than a nice hot stone pot Bibimbap! In the summer it's good but in the winter it's even better!  We came by and tried here because our other Korean favourite was closed on Tuesdays.  Portions are a bit smaller here but really how much food do you need to eat?  How fat do you want to get?  Portions were big enough to satisfy and leave with a full stomach. The meal came with your regular assortment of Banchan, but again quantities were a bit smaller!  In the front entrance they proudly display all of their restaurant reviews that date back to 2005 and earlier.  Price wise a bit more but quality is there!"}
{"text":"Always crowed so expect to arrive earlier to line up!  Seafood pancake is one of the best I've had...even compared to those I've had in Korea! The pork leg is also one of my favorite there.  Clean and friendly service with good food."}
{"text":"I got a small noodle soup for 17$ ..... it was literally just noodles and vegetable stock."}
{"text":"TLDR: Cute little restaurant that quickly serves authentic bold Korean deliciousness. Warning: the portions are HUGE.  This restaurant works on a first come first serve basis, and why not considering they are always packed. We went on a Tuesday and the door was constantly opening by people in hopes of eating something delicious.  The three of us sat down and studied the long menu religiously. We agreed to share everything and finally decided on the dumplings (they are filled with beef), a spicy cold beef glass noodle soup, bibimbap in a hot stone bowl, and seolleongtang (beef bone broth soup). If you want dessert at the end you will have to go elsewhere as the do not have a dessert menu.  The meal starts with some delicious homemade Kimchi, cucumber salad, marinated potatoes, crunchy spicy marinated something that I couldn't figure out (I think it was also potatoes), and bean sprout salad. We all agreed that our favourite was the tangy cucumber salad.  The steamed dumplings came first and they were very tasty. Simple, delicious, and the accompanying sauces were much appreciated. We also used the leftover sauces from the side dishes for some diversity in flavour.  Our three \"main sharing dishes\" arrived and we realised that we probably got the worst three dishes to share. Don't get me wrong, they were fabulous in flavour, texture, etc. However, when it comes to sharing... noodle soups are a bad idea. Also, the portions were massive. We were three people and we still had leftovers!  The scissors provided at the beginning of the meal was for the kimchi, but we ended up using them for the long noodles in the soup as we had a lot of trouble picking them up! I do apologise if we offended anyone by cutting our noodles!  The bone broth soup was one of the most decadent soups I have ever tasted, and every spoonful was belly-filling. The spicy cold beef noodle soup had just the right kick and was bursting with flavour. The winning dish was the bibimbap with the crunchy rice at the bottom. We all agreed that we will still order it the next time we come back.  At the end of the meal, I asked the waiter which dishes were the best for sharing because clearly noodle soups are not ideal. He pointed me towards the Korean bbq plates in the front of the menu and of course the sharing platters in the back. He also informed me that their most popular dish is the seafood pancake, which is great for people who enjoy seafood. We will definitely heed is advice the next time we visit. My last note is that the food is very warming, so I will most likely be frequenting the Kwang Kum more in the winter than the summer.  Definitely an experience I would recommend :)"}
{"text":"Casual Saturday night eating out with friends. It's a small restaurant who do not take reservations so first arrived first served.  Food was authentic. Service was long since we were a table of 6 (compared to 2/4 )  It was recommended by our sister-in-law"}
{"text":"Food is so great here! But I'm so confused by their schedule... It says it closes at 10 on Yelp, and usually they'll keep it longer... But we are told we have to leave at 9:30 when we arrived at about 9.... Fortunately we are fast eaters, but It was still kinda upset and awkward...wish we could have more time to enjoy the food"}
{"text":"they are closed for a month. Very confused about their opening hours. Keep delaying. Just call before you go there. Hope they will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my mom's favorite korean restaurant which is also why I brought her there for mother's day dinner :).   As usual their seafood pancakes are the best!! Freshly made, crispy and super delicious.   If you go there, make sure you order the Galbi, it's their beef rib steak. Chewy and sweet.   Spicy tofu soup is their most authentic korean soup, is your perfect match with korean rice.   Unfortunately, besides these 3 dishes, the others aren't as good. It's either too salty or it taste weird... My wife is also a fanatic korean food lover so I have korean quite often...   The service is okay, the food arrive quickly despite the fact that they are always packed!"}
{"text":"Hwang-Kum you did it, you have the first bibimbap that I actually liked. I've had a couple of bibimbaps at different places but the majority of them were too bland to my liking. I also loved the japchae which was mouthwatering - the sweetness was a perfect incentive for wanting more.   Although, my first taste of Hwang-Kum was hoe naengmyeon, which was a cold dish made of buckwheat noodles and raw fish. It was decent but strange at the same time. The raw fish is not your average sashimi. With a bit of online researching I found out that it's in fact skate fish. The texture resembled pickled herring with added cartilage toughness. The noodles were also interesting, they seemed to be never ending and tough to chew. As I was slurping the Rapunzel noodles my eyes shifted to the pair scissors that were mysteriously provided with the meal. I'm pretty sure they were there for a good reason.  Staffs were friendly, walls and decoration conveyed Korea, overall, I'd absolutely recommend Hwang-Kum if you want to good Korean food or perhaps to further explore its cuisine."}
{"text":"Wish I was able to try this place. Arrived at 904pm and told us they were closed. Tried again for Lunch today and was waiting at the door until 1210pm. Hours may need to be fixed.  Still not open"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant. But the quality of the food is very good! Really authentic Korean food in my opinion! It's the best Korean restaurant I tried so far in Montreal. Highly recommend the seafood Korean pan cake! It's a bit pricy though."}
{"text":"Definitely my best Korean joint in town! a must go :)  Jit Hoong Lim"}
