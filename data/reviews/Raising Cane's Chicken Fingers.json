{"text":"Ordered a meal, realized it was Veterans day asked for a possible discount. The manager proceeds to comp my meal. I may be no hero but the employees and managers sure made me feel special. Thank you so much for making this veterans night. Very on point and squared away team at this Canes location.   Thank you,  Chris"}
{"text":"The chicken is dry and has no flavor, but it's nice and crunchy. The fries are good. Also the dipping sauce is good."}
{"text":"We love Raising Canes. My wife and I always treat our kids for Raising Canes. We use to go to either St Rose or the one on the Strip. So, When I found out that they're building one by our house I was happy that I don't have to go far anymore. But the past two times we've come to this location we've been so disappointed. I love their chicken. I love the texas toast and the sweet tea..out of the three the chicken was on point. Texas toast was not buttered or toasted on both side..Sweet teas taste like chemicals and it ruins the whole experience of the meal. I guess I would be going to St Rose for now until this place fixes the problems. Apparently I'm not the only one who's tasting the nasty taste on the drinks."}
{"text":"Don't go here yet, this place is way too slow!!!!  Then the girl at the window instead of apologizing started giving me excuses!!!  Avoid this location at all cost they need time to get it together!!!!  I won't be going back"}
{"text":"When we are craving chicken we crave Canes. Love the manager and staff!  Go Broncos!  Thanks for always making us feel welcome and for your yummy food. Love the sweet tea too!"}
{"text":"There I was a lot of hype surrounding the opening of this establishment.  I was excited to give it a try.  My very first impression was not a positive one. For starters the handicapped parking spots are on the way in the back of the restaurant. After entering the restaurant, I noticed there were many dirty tables and chairs were shoved everywhere.  We decided to place an order even though our first impression wasn't  a positive one.  In retrospect, I'm wishing we would've just left!  We ordered a couple of baskets of the six piece strips which came with fries coleslaw and bread.  The chicken did seem fresh however it lacked flavor. The fries were soggy and cold and the bread left something to be desired as also lacked flavor.  I observed a woman in a wheelchair trying to get around in the strip restaurant and having a very difficult time.  I felt very bad for her as it seems this restaurant is not very ADA compliant.  The staff all seemed very board especially considering it's a new place.  In my opinion if you want great fast food chicken and hot, crispy fries, go across the street to Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"I used to think chick-fil-a had the best fast food chicken around my area... but after multiple times going to canes I was wrong. Texas toast and that canes sauces sets Raising Canes to the next level."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fried chicken fan but Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers are awesome. They are real chicken not pressed chicken! Very good!"}
{"text":"It is very mediocre they serve their chicken strips with a horrible brown mayonnaise with pepper in it. I had written the corporate office complaining that I thought this mayonnaise dip they have was awful and of course I never heard back from anybody."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything is cooked to perfection and the cane sauce is so amazing! I definitely recommend this place to anyone that has need been here. Only downside to it is that the drive-thru isn't very fast. Highly suggest just going inside!"}
{"text":"Employees are always rude, tables are dirty, chicken is dry, wait is too long. Save yourself the time and drive down the street to PDQ. More sauce options and menu variety. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"My family loves Cane's, but tap water taste like fish here. They make their lemonade and ice tea with this water, making both lemonade and ice tea taste like it was made in a fish tank. I usually only drink water, tea, or lemonade, so this is a big downfall.  Everything else here is great!   *Update* The water issue is fixed. The water, lemonade, and ice tea are 100% better.  Thank you for listening, for the great food and customer service at this location!"}
{"text":"Was excited that a canes had opened near me. Went after the grand opening, the person taking the order was very slow and lacked training. The soda had a horrible after taste almost like it was mixed with water from lake mead. The order was not right. So sad about this, I will drive the car extra distance to go to the one off of st rose."}
{"text":"Finally a Canes near my house.  Good place for chicken."}
{"text":"Marginally decent chicken strips for marginally decent prices. The chicken was relatively moist but a little tough, the Cane's sauce was definitely not boss in my book (very little flavor other than sweet) and the fries were lukewarm and soggy. As others have mentioned, the drive-thru is engineered poorly with a payment window right as you turn the corner, leading to long lines. If there were other sauce options and better fries it'd be a place re-visiting."}
{"text":"Great food right down the street, long line since it just opened but fast friendly service. I'd take a picture but the only thing left is an empty box. Their water does need an RO system for ice and beverages since our tap water is almost illegal by EPA standards and tastes horrible even when mixed with delicious sweet tea syrup"}
{"text":"Food is bland, they cook slow, \"toast\" is extremely soft and not good, fries not crispy, chicken not crispy, its just soggy and unseasoned"}
{"text":"All I can say is 'Wow'.  This is some of the best Chicken Fingers I have ever had.  The place was clean, fantastic and the food was excellent.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru today ordered the 6 einder combo, got home there is only 4 tenders in the box call talked to mgr she says next time in get free meal, I live across town just stopped in there because never had their chicken, told mgr it wasn't worth it to do that, I asked if she could just credit my card she laughed and said no way and hung up"}
{"text":"In drive thru right now...waiting 20 mins for some chicken strips! Let's see if they even apologize for the wait. NOPE!!"}
{"text":"Food is normally good. Today they ran out of flour!!  Really?!?! And didn't even bother to tell all the people waiting in the drive-thru, just left us sitting there with no way out."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good the chicken was really juicy and the fries were fresh and got along with the toast. Service was kinda blehh but overall was pretty satisfied on the whole meal just wish when I ask for another side of sauce I didn't have to pay for it. Or when I ask for ketchup I get one packet."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's never disappoints! Chicken so fresh that you'll think you made it! Cane sauce is great for fries too!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, I did until I found a black hair literally baked in to my chicken. I'm a server so I didn't bring it to any ones attention but just watch out when enjoying the chicken strips at canes"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! When we lived in south east we had Zaxby's. We miss eating there, but this place is so much like it. The sauce here is basically Zax sauce. The chicken is really juicy and I love the Texas toast. I went through the drive thru and they were super friendly and fast. We will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Oh WOW! My daughter will not stop talking about the food at Raising Cane's!It has become an obsession for her.They take your order at the counter and bring your tray to you as soon as your food is ready.The chicken is fried to perfection,juicy,hot, and crispy.So good!We went there about three hours ago,and we want to go back now!The staff is so nice and the restaurant is clean.They sure know how to make us happy!"}
{"text":"Don't spend money here on drinks, the food is just like every other Cane's but the drinks taste like they've all been siphoned through a plastic bag filled with napkins, and then they don't even change the napkins out for a different kind of drink. It's just a bag with a cocktail of different flavors and it's terrible"}
{"text":"Are place to go for good tasting chicken, first time I'd tried Canes, I've been going back since."}
{"text":"I know this place just opened but come on.   First the slowest drive thru ever.  Also the food was very poor. The coleslaw had no sauce, the chicken had a burnt oil smell and the lemonade was terrible like previous reviews it tasted like tap water with chlorine in it.  I have been to many Raising Cains before and I am a huge fan but this location better step up the quality or I will go elsewhere.  I don't like to complain but this was bad."}
{"text":"Slow service, management doesn't even know there own promotions (ASU Game Ticket) which is on the counter by the register, if it wasn't for the good food I wouldn't bother but I'm not going to drive to Avondale for chicken fingers"}
{"text":"Went on 6/22/16 around 10 pm (after a long drive from Reno went in and order two box combos to go told them to switch the coleslaw for a extra bread. They had great customer service. Took about 15 mins to get are food. Once I got home and was about to eat I notice I only had one bread. they forgot my extra bread on both orders .  Was too tired to go back."}
{"text":"Went there before Midnight Saturday 6/6/15.  Order taker was friendly/pleasant for such a late hour.  Ordered Chicken fingers & service/food were both good!"}
{"text":"WHAT THE HECK IS IN THEIR WATER?!!!? Drinks taste like chemicals. Go anywhere but this location. Someone please call health inspector on this place. So sad because I love Canes and was excited to have one close to my house."}
{"text":"Place needs improvement drive through is slow, chicken is tiny and not worth the money. I have been to other locations that have much better service and food quality."}
{"text":"I LOVE Raising Cane's. The food is good and the sauce is even better. The employees are usually attentive and nice and always get my order right. That said, in this particular incident I went through the Drive-thru, I ordered a Caniac combo and asked for a half and half as a drink. She kept repeating my order back to me as a sweet tea, when I drove up to the window to pay, I corrected her and told her it was a half and half and she looked over at my drink and said that's what was made. I took a sip and told her politely that it wasn't a half and half, she then proceeded to argue with me that it was and that she had made it herself. She then offered to make me another one but that it would taste the same, so I let it go and drove off a little annoyed only to realize that she thought a half and half was half of a sweet tea and half of an unsweetened tea. A half and half, also known as an Arnold Palmer is mixture of half tea and half lemonade. Every time I have gone inside and asked for this type of drink, there has NEVER been an issue."}
{"text":"Drive through is very long time to wait, this is just bad management and no planning on the staff. If the management knows that this is a problem then they should anticipate this and plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Perfect everytime! Can't go wrong here.  The chicken is always fresh and crunchy. The toast is amazing!!! And love their sauce. They do one thing and did it rite!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually find cane's to be pretty tasty and I visit the Arcadia location often. However, this cane's left a lot to be desired. I came home tonight to find that the three finger combo I ordered had two fingers and one very skinny strip of chicken that was about as thin as a French fry. You can imagine my disappointment but I ate it anyways because I was starving. I doubt anyone in management will read this, but I just want you yelpers to be aware to check your meals in the drive-thru before you head home."}
{"text":"This is the first place I been to where I can say \"you have to try their chicken strips!\"  It's soo good and the bread is amazing! Can't forget the sauce that goes really well with the chicken and I don't mind dipping their fries in it as well! I recommend this place to anyone who wants some good fast food  Haven't met one person yet who doesn't like to eat here. Oh and I absolutely love tea and when I tried their sweet tea for the first time, it just made the meal even better!"}
{"text":"Love the sweet tea, chicken is super moist and tasty. Wish they had something other than fries, maybe side salad Instead. Did I mention the sweet tea!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place. So decide to try the food to see what the rave was about. Went thru the drive thru and ordered. Pulled up to pay and there were 6 girls at the register talking and playing on their cell phones. When I received my food, no straws were given and the food was cold.  I think I'll next time I will pass and head somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service, well mannered, and fast delivery. I came in and got my food within 10 mins. Some of the best costumer service I've ever had here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I Love Raising Cane's!  The food is always tastes fresh, the chicken and fries are fresh every time. Now that toast, Yummmmy!  the sesame seeds give it that added touch if I don't say so myself and I forget to the lemonade. I can never recall ever having a bad experience at any location I've encountered. My daughter loves here too. 4 thumbs up"}
{"text":"food is always great. location is new, so it's always busy. drive thru line gets backed up which always confuses me because there is not much on the menu."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru at around 11 before the lunch rush & it took 15 minutes!! There was no one in line ahead of me so idk why it took so long. The girl running the drive thru didn't even check back with me to apologize for the wait even though the employees kept looking at me through the window. & she put the lemon in my lemonade with her bare hands. No utensils, no gloves. Just her grimey fingers. Food was good so there's that."}
{"text":"First time at Raising Cain's Chicken and probably my last. The place was new, clean, and had lots of room. Never been to a place that the menu was chicken tenders only. Noticed a fellow waiting for his order when I came in. I took a few minutes to look over the menu to see what was available. Two people ordered ahead of me. They got their orders and this guy was still waiting. I got my order and he was still waiting. Thought he might have ordered the 100 tender order. He finally went up to find out where his box meal was. Now this guy had been there at least 20 minutes waiting on a 4 tender box meal. They had lost his order. Really! On a POS system that prints out directly to the kitchen. I know it took them another 7 or 8 minutes to get this guy a 4 tender box meal. I not sure if a Manager was on duty as all I saw were 16 year old's running the show. All I was thinking was that some schmuck had spent a million dollars on this place and had a bunch of teenagers running it! As for my food. The tenders were nice and moist but were flavorless. The fries were limp and had 2 coatings of salt. The famous sauce was poor at best and I was sure glad I found the ketchup that took 5 minutes to fill a 1 once cup. At least the ketchup had a good flavor. The toasted bread was also flavorless. If you want good chicken tenders with flavor, go to Popeye's. Oh,the Cole slaw was  ok. I also tried the lemonade. It needs a lot more lemons! With a little help the tenders could be great if they give them some flavor. The rest could be corrected by a good chef in the kitchen. If you have never had great chicken, then you might think this is the best as many of the reviews state. The owner needs to get Management under control. 25 minutes to get this guy his food and no one even checked why he was standing they is really poor Customer Service and shows the lack of good Management! Period!"}
{"text":"Was treated very Rude by the female manager , my daughter was even upset about how she was to me. Christie has also been rude at another location to me. I do not know her. Makes it not worth it!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is all about the chicken!  I got the 3 piece basket with fries, Texas toast, and 3 pieces of chicken.  The coleslaw was very good too very juicy with a wonderful flavor.  The food is very filling, but great!  The freshly squeezed lemonade was tasty too!  The staff and manger were really nice and got us the sauces we wanted!  The bathrooms are clean and updated!  It was our first time and we were very pleased.  We would definitely be going back again!!!"}
{"text":"Decent chicken. Consistent quality and freshness. Lines in the drive through for a reason. Great party packages available for ordering in the drive through. Not quite as good as Chick-fil-A but at a better price."}
{"text":"The service is always fast. The chicken fingers are always HOT and tender. I usually wind up eating the fries and toast while I let the chicken cool."}
{"text":"They're food is always consistent and on point !  The dining room is always packed but it doesn't mean you can't find a table or fast service. My family and I really enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Delicious!  You can have anything you want here, as long as it's chicken fingers.  Delicious, delicious, chicken fingers...mmmm."}
{"text":"Before you read canes food is 5 stars okay story time  So I go to canes and order my food no slaw extra fries I go up to the window and noticed I got overcharged 40 cents and told the lady but I said it was fine cause it looked like she had a rough day so I get my food and drive  I check and I have the slaw so I go back and see her I started to laugh and smile and said its me being completely nice and let her know what happened and she was nice again and asked her co workers to give me fries   So in that span over charged and messed up order I was still okay with it cause I know how stressful food can be   So I ask for a refill while I get my fries cause ya know it's the least they can do so she said sure no problem (still nice)  So she turns around to get my refill and her boss manager GM (Some dark short Asian with a pink hat) whatever the fuck he is has to ruin it. He's the reason it's a one star  He bitches and complains that she can't give me a fucking refill I wanted to go off on him so bad that like are you fucking serious that pisses me off so much cause you can tell this man does nothing but bitch at his employees   That's why it's a one star not because of the mistakes but because this man really had the balls to bitch at his co worker because I ask for a refill after the fuck ups? If canes or that fuck face wants to talk to me feel free to message me  By the way I felt so bad for that girl after she gave me my refill I gave her 2$ just so her day can get somewhat better anyways yeah fuck that Asian guy with the pink hat  Tuesday 11PM"}
{"text":"I don't see what all the fuss is about this place. The chicken fingers are average and the sauce is not that great. It's fine for a fast food place but don't go here expecting anything more than that"}
{"text":"Love this place, great chicken fingers. Would love a spicy alternative though. The texas toast is the BEST. Always friendly staff, they really seem to appreciate their customers. Try it!!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious!!! Although they have long drive-thru lines, just go in and order."}
{"text":"I first found this place while in Las Vegas, and it quickly became a staple during my trips.  To choose to eat fast food in vegas over the million other options should speak for itself.  Imagine my excitement when one opened up near my house!  Very simple menu, but great food doesn't need to be complicated.  Pass on the ketchup, I would drink the sauce alone if I wasn't worried about dying.  Dip everything you own in it."}
{"text":"The last two times that I've eaten at this location I've found small hairs in my food. Today was the last time. I will not be going back here ever again. One look in the kitchen and every male employee has a beard. Easy to figure out where the hairs are coming from."}
{"text":"I've been to canes multiple times the food is great! unfortunately I've found a couple hairs in my food. tonight we decided to stop and get some chicken fingers. the cashier taking the orders had an attitude. my friend asked for her chicken \"extra crispy\" and you can tell the girl making the food and the cashier were upset about it. the lady making the food kept giving us dirty looks and the whole staff in fact. after 15 minutes of waiting finally we got our food. inside, it wasn't even full and every one who ordered after us revived there food before us, plus more time for just 3 fingers a little more crispy. we've ordered extra crispy chicken before and never had it take this long or turn into such a problem. BUMMER"}
{"text":"Excellent as always!  I was just introduced to Cane's last winter, and was excited to be able to visit one again.  We don't have this chain in the Midwest, but I think it would be a big hit!"}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Good service, friendly & patient at ordering. Quickly served despite it being super busy.  Food was hot & fresh. Only complains are it was noisy & fries were a bit too salty. And need a better selection of drinks!"}
{"text":"**BEWARE** Pregnant women and children. Their sweet tea is not pasteurized and on the label warns it can harm children and those with weakened immune systems. The 2 stars are because the chicken fingers and fries are good. Too bad I drank some tea before asking my husband to check the caffeine content on the label and he yelled STOP DRINKING that! I said why, too much caffeine? That is when we discovered the warning label."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. I paid $32 for 25 strips which was too much for my family. 15 strips would have been perfect. Didn't come with anything but the sauce. I could have gone to frys and gotten strips, wedges, macaroni salad and drinks for $32.00. Won't be returning for sure. Also the staff was too social with each other that when I was talking to the cashier I had to repeat myself 3 times."}
{"text":"The chicken is just okay. The texas toast is nothing great. The french fries were the same as the ones in the frozen section of the grocery store. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat , great chicken fingers & dipping sauce. But the last few times we went the drinks taste like burnt plastic or as if it were chemically contaminated. Good food & nice crew but skip the fountain drinks & lemonade. \"Chicken fingers al la carte please\""}
{"text":"We LOVE raising canes. The staff is always friendly. The food is so so so good! The best chicken fingers around! We go here often!"}
{"text":"I have never had a problem from any of the Raising Cane's I have visited here in the Valley, and the new Chandler location is no different. From the moment my friends and I walked in, we were kindly greeted by the staff at the counter and made to feel welcome. The bright red pops of color throughout the restaurant added to the fun atmosphere along with the interesting movie posters on the walls. The music was not too loud or too low and added to the upbeat environment. There was one worker at the register and when another staff member saw we were waiting, they took to action and rang up our order. I did not feel rushed and felt as if this worker genuinely cared about servicing me and my friends. We sat in a booth with noticeably comfortable seating as we waited for our meal. Our food arrived relatively quickly after we ordered and was exactly what we expected  I ordered the 2-piece chicken tender kids meal which included fries, the classic sweet tea, and canes sauce, which is amazing when paired with the strips. My meal was nice and warm and clearly fresh. The fries had a fair amount of salt and crisp to them indicating they had not been sitting out. My tenders were hot with the chicken fully cooked through on the inside; with a nice juicy taste and crispy breading. I was also able to pull apart my tenders with no trouble which made my dining experience even better as they were easy to eat. They do have plenty of drink options but the sweet tea is a favorite and was fresh and sugared just enough. Unfortunately, if you want extra sauce there is a charge but overall my meal was just as I expected and beyond.   The staff maintained a clean dining room and was constantly keeping up with the trash and tables. They also continued to stock napkins and the drink station as needed throughout our visit. The sweet teas were sufficiently filled and never went empty. There were multiple clean tables and the floor was constantly swept for crumbs and debris. The restrooms were well maintained, stocked with toilet paper, napkins, and was updated. The sink was clean, the mirror had a few smudges, and the floor was freshly mopped.   The service throughout the night continued to increase and made our dining experience even more enjoyable and fun. The workers had no problem interacting with us and even made friendly jokes with us which caused plenty of laughs. We did not feel rushed to leave as the restaurant was getting near to close and felt welcome throughout our stay. We even had an employee offer to refresh our drinks and clear our table. I am absolutely impressed as this is a new location, and can say without a doubt Cane's has excelled. Their staff, food, and cleanliness was above and beyond. I will be going back to this location and know my friends and family will be too."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The service was great. The food came quickly and was piping hot. We Will  definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food was and tasted like quality sandwich material, however, I believe the server that served my food possibly gave me some sort of sickness, I do not like to judge people but my server lacked basic hygiene I think that is why I got sick. I really enjoy the food but that one server makes me uncomfortable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I hit this place twice a week! Service is fast food is great along with the delicious canes sauce. . Love it!"}
{"text":"My girls love Raisin Canes. They make me pick up chicken fingers every Friday night. This joint is always packed. The workers are always friendly and when their is a line they bring out an extra cashier. I always go inside because I hate waiting in the drive through."}
{"text":"I really do not write reviews, but I really feel like I need to for this location.  This past week, I visited this Raising Canes for the first time.  With out having been to one before, the gentleman at the register smiled, told me about how they marinade the chicken etc and proceeded to help me decide what to order.  At the last minute I added a 3rd order, because I told him that we have a lady at work who is having a really bad day so I wanted to bless her.  He asked \"she is having a bad day?  I am so sorry to hear that\".  He handed me the receipts without taking a payment.  He said not to worry that all three meals were being comped and that he hopes her day gets better and that we all come back!  Amazing customer service, the food was really yummy.  I highly recommend the honey mustard sauce!  Thank you Mr Alfredo Quintana!  Because of your kindness and customer service we will for sure be back and I will spread the word :)"}
{"text":"Good food reminds me of zaxbys. Only problem is the lack of sauce choice, first time I went there to be told there is either canes  sauce or ketchup?? What kind of place serves chicken and only offers 2 sauce types. Only plus is they have ok fries and bread."}
{"text":"the texas toast or whatever it's called is great. im from the sf bay area, so ive never even heard of this chain. however, it's bomb and the customer service was awesome too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite fast food chicken tender places.  Whether you sit down or drive thru, the service is fast, reliable, and good food. I come here all the time and I never got my order wrong.  Never used to care for chicken tenders till i ate it here.  The way they cook it makes it juicy and soft yet crispy on the outside.    They're known for their sauce which I love just because it tastes different from a lot of sauces out there.    Texas toast is divine.  The bread is big and soft with a nice crisp on the top. The sweet tea is too sweet for me so I just add water to taste.    Here's my usual order.  (I go for the biggest so I have left over to take home haha). Caniac Combo, no slaw, extra toast, with a sweet tea."}
{"text":"With Caniac Combo; ask for 2 caniac sauces, one honey mustard (great with the bread), and 3 ketchup packets (6 sauces total)... And you are set! Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"If you're tired of grumpy workers and crappy fast food, Canes is the answer.   Food is fresh and delicious, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. If you prefer drive thru they are fast and friendly. We stopped at the drive thru today (Christmas eve) and Tony was the happiest, funniest guy I've ever seen. Working Christmas Eve and having fun while providing awesome service - great guy and great staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is ok.  The drive thru is HORRIBLE.  Takes 20 minutes to go through the drive thru.  All they have are chicken fingers on their own or in a bun.  It's not like they don't know what the next order is going to be (hint...it's chicken fingers). Why does it always take so long to get through the drive thru?!?"}
{"text":"September 14th , 2015  pulled to the drive thru window and there were 10 cars ahead of me. In the span of less than 10 minutes; I was picking up my order. Fast and efficient.   The only complaint I have is that my caniac combo did not have enough fries.  Boo.   Chicken fingers are awesome though."}
{"text":"Hey Raising Canes fam,               Had my order to go, waited for a while since it's the grand opening. Caniac combo was lit, but what I look forward to the most is the lemonade (ordered two and tasted one) yo, it tasted like it had tap water I couldn't drink it and my wife couldn't drink it. It affects the experience entirely. :( I feel bad for the elderly woman who ordered a gallon. Everybody loves dat lemonade doeeee."}
{"text":"Over 30 min in drive thru to realize the food i received was over cooked and disgusting."}
{"text":"This may be the best food value in Vegas! Great chicken fingers, fries, bread and sauces."}
{"text":"Okay it was my first time at canes today. The manager was FANTASTIC. He asked if it was our first time There and I said yes... He walked is through the menu and took our rather large order for a big group (to go). He offered us a drink while we waited and had an excellent persona. I appreciate his Customer service and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"There was nothing wrong with the service, everyone was friendly and the staff was attentive. Everything was clean and looked nice but our food just wasn't what we expected. I haven't been to a Cane's before and was interested in trying them out. The chicken was nice and the fries were fine but they only have their house sauce or honey mustard. I wasn't a fan of either option which left me with dry chicken fingers. I realize that's just personal taste though so just a warning to other kinda picky eaters: they have two sauces and that's it. Maybe order to go if you're not sure."}
{"text":"Ok. I noticed everyone loves this place. The one on Stephanie is new so I'll cut them some slack and get right to the food. The chicken fingers are all they have so if your looking for variety, well don't. They are very moist and tender, however they were bland and I couldn't detect one spice of any kind, including salt. It came with fries, coleslaw and texas toast, definately filling just everything was bland including the coleslaw and fries.  It's extremely busy there. I only want to say if you only have one thing, add some flavor please. The price was right though."}
{"text":"I just ordered box combo with Extra sauce. You guys even repeated my order to me as you handed me my food and when I got home no extra sauce yet I got charged."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers I've ever had! Small menu but what they have they do well! Friendly staff and clean dine in area."}
{"text":"I am giving it 3 stars because all the drinks have an after-taste of chlorine. I have tried the lemonade, coke and tea, all taste of chlorine. I haven't tried other Cane's but the beverages here aren't worth the money."}
{"text":"I watched the employee cleaning the tables then WITHOUT washing his hands he gets my food and brings it around.  Ewwww is all I thought. First time visit became my last"}
{"text":"Scrumptious! Best chicken strips ever. Definitely not something to be eaten everyday though as a box combo is 1000 calories."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time. I wasn't sure of what to order and told the worker it was my first time there. He guided me through the menu, I ordered a combo meal with 4 chicken strips, cole slaw, fries, and the Texas toast. The meal also came with a drink and their special sauce. It was amazing! Not to mention, when I pulled up to pay for my order the manager Derek comes out and says the meal is on the house since it is my first time there! How sweet is that! Defiantly will come back here!"}
{"text":"No no no. You're doing it all wrong. I've had my share of Cane's food over the last few years and you seriously need to get it together. I understand you're a new location but c'mon. There's only like four things on your menu. It can't be that hard. The fries are either limp or so overdone that they're chewy. Chewy fries? Yeah, that takes talent. The chicken is off also. Not to mention that I keep getting chicken toes here instead of chicken fingers. Very inconsistent with size. Can't comment on the coleslaw since I never eat it. The root beer tastes like plastic. On two very separate occasions! We thought we'd give them another try tonight and their carbonation machine was broken. Say whaaa? So we got sugar water. We even had to pay full price for it. Two stars because the Cane's sauce tastes right. In conclusion, it's worth the extra drive to the St Rose location. They actually give Raising Cane's a good name."}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient staff. Upbeat environment. Delicious food. Tender chicken strips and good lemonade. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Best chicken on the planet. So nice that it's so close to home."}
{"text":"Pretty good fried chicken. Really good for Phoenix. Wish they had a spicy version of the chicken or their dipping sauce for those who like it hot."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and they unfortunately forgot to give me Texas toast with my box order. Great food. Service was super fast, that's probably why they forgot part of my order. Will be back to try it again."}
{"text":"Update!!! The nasty tasting drinks have been fixed! Their beverages all taste how they should and Cane's gets the five stars that it should!"}
{"text":"This place meets your chicken finger needs for sure, and the dipping sauce is really, really good.  Very friendly, helpful staff and even though you might have to wait a bit (3-5 minutes) you get fresh chicken (yes, the chicken is not frozen), freshly prepared and it is juicy and delicious.  I like Chick-fil-a also but the dipping sauce and price for a large family take-out pack puts this place over the top for me."}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, and delicious chicken fingers with Texas toast mmmmm and some sweet tea to wash it down.. they were super fast and friendly at the drive thru no complaints!"}
{"text":"2 stars. So on top of the 30 cents for my lemonade when I order a combo, I'm expected to be charged extra 85 cents for every lemonade refill. Taking my business to Chickfila, they refill my lemonade as often as I like, free!"}
{"text":"Make sure your food is fresh they have a bad habit of handing out old food esp close to closing... spoke with manager who said i could comeback to get fresh food problem is dunno when ill ever have them on my tastebuds again"}
{"text":"THe chicken was superb. The fingers were moist, soft, flavorful, great meals. The sandwiches goes the same with what I just wrote, let's just say it hits the spot every time. I live in Hawaii and you know that's where I gotta hit up when we visit the family."}
{"text":"Our family has eaten here about once a week since they have opened, most of they time the food is great, hot and consistent. I usually order a Caniac Combo and share it with my kids. They get four stars from me because of their ticket time, it always seems like we wait at the table for our food for close to twenty minutes. Their customer service is great so they are very accommodating but I wouldn't suggest it for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The whole drive thru situation has gotten completely out of hand the last several months. The line snakes out past Message Envy into the street. It's so inconvenient to spend 30 minutes of a 60 minute lunch in line. They need a system like Chik Fil A or something."}
{"text":"Been eating here since they opened in this location at least once to twice a week.  Parking: GOOD LUCK, during the evenings this place can get packed and a few times no open parking spots.  Seating Area: Clean, but on rush hours you may need to take a table that just opened up for less than a minute covered in crumbs.  The seats facing the west windows have 100% every time had flys. (very bothersome).  Food: crispy and served to you like any other cane's (they carry hot sauce packets if you ask. They do not serve mustard, as I found out today.)"}
{"text":"As far as fast food chicken goes, this is my favorite. It's not greasy, yet very moist inside. The Garlic bread & Fries are awesome too. I wish they had more of a menu though. Sometimes I'm in the mood for some popcorn chicken or shrimp. They also should expand on their dipping sauces, as 1 time on the way over I had to stop at Burger King for some BBQ sauce for my Daughter."}
{"text":"We love this chicken!  It is so yummy and their baskets are great for feeding the family.  We've been a couple times now and we will continue to go back.  Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Very rude staff. Bunch of little teenagers who have no customer service experience or manners.  Drive thru is a joke. After asking 3 times what I wanted to order, still got my order wrong. Did not even give me a receipt !"}
{"text":"When Cane's 1st opened here we went and the chicken fingers were huge! So we didn't mind the prices. Now the chicken fingers are smaller and the prices went up?! We are not happy with this. The sweet tea is absolutely wonderful!  The TX toast is pretty good and we have always enjoyed dining in or out...I don't like that they charge for extra sauce. I mean really you reduced the size of the chicken, and raised prices and now you want more money for an extra sauce? Are you serious?  These are just a few legitimate reasons for a 4 star instead of a 5...they use to be a 5 in my eyes. Now the flavors are still delicious, and the people who work there are nice. So that's a big plus. I'm just afraid soon it will be chicken bites instead of tenders and I'll be charged even more. Bring back the bigger tenders or for the sake of peace stop charges on extra sauce! The end."}
{"text":"I've been to more than 50 Cane's across the US so when we rolled up to this location and noticed 20 cars in the drive-thru and a packed parking lot we weren't surprised. Cane's is the best-fast food chicken tenders in the Phoenix area. The chain is fairly new here but has been around in the South for a while. As long as you dig chicken tenders this spot will become a normal one on your fast-food list.   What's so good about Canes? And, why is it so much better than places like KFC and Popeyes? Canes dishes out hand breaded chicken tenders, average fries and good sweet tea/lemonade. Best though is that it's perfect every time. They've mastered consistency. Whether you arrive at 11 am or 11pm the tenders always taste the same. Fresh, quality white meat is always the norm. There's no gristle. No dark meat. No lukewarm chicken. You come here for value, flavor and good service - and get it every time.    A few things to remember about Cane's (from a Cane's expert):  *The fresh squeezed lemonade is hand squeezed daily and brings a perfect blend or lemon/sugar cane and that favorite shaved ice. It does costs a few cents more than the sweet tea/fountain drinks - and it's worth paying.   *The toast is soaked in butter and then served with a crisp exterior. It's as unhealthy as you could ask for - but tastes so good!  *You might want to order an extra side of Cane's sauce. It's that good. Really.   *They serve fried chicken here - and fried chicken. I hope you eat chicken. Don't ask for a salad.   *Don't ask for ranch, honey mustard or BBQ sauce, either. It's ketchup or Cane's sauce.   *The sweet tea is good. Like Southern good."}
{"text":"Like it says, Yay! I'm a fan. These are some good chicken strips. The Texas toast is really good too. Plus the fries and never forget the Cane's sauce. The sause works so well with the chicken. I have heard of this place for a while but had never tried it. Mostly because I wasn't near any locations. I llike this one because it is close to school. Works out just right to run over on break and grab some chicken strips. I have only been through the drive thru so I don't know how the inside of the restaurant looks but through the windows it looks very nice and clean. The employees are always very nice and seem like they genuinely like working there. The drive thru moves pretty good. They only have one thing on the menu so it is pretty easy. You just have to decide how many strips you want. Every box comes with fries, Texas toast and of course the yummy sause. You can also get coleslaw in some of the boxes. I have yet to try that. The prices are pretty good too. No more than other fast food places. I am a fan and I will continue to come here on break. The chicken is very tender and juicy. It just falls apart when you bit into it. So good. Winner winner chicken dinner! I had to say it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Raising Canes! Food and sweet tea are delicious! Service is not that great, rude and lazy employees...I gave exact change, and then got more change back. The girl insisted that she counted it twice and I was short ten cents. She took forever to give me my change, but IF I WAS short, couldn't you ask for the dime?! Boo"}
{"text":"By far the best Cane's I've been to. The line moves quickly and we had our food 30 seconds after taking our seats. The food was fresh, hot, crunchy, and of good quality. As I was gathering my trash an employee came over and offered to finish cleaning up for me, wished us a good day with a pleasant smile on her face, and we were on our way. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Pretty good and friendly service. Substitute cole slaw for more fries and there's an up charge? Doesn't necessarily make sense to me."}
{"text":"Love the chicken. It's always hot and fresh tasting. I've never had any issues at this location beside the fact that they're BUSY. But that's why the drive through is designed to hold so many cars. It is what it is people."}
{"text":"So happy to have a Cane's on our side of town. We recently moved out to surprise away from the one on McDowell so we were so excited to have one not even a mile for us! As usual long lines inside and long lines in the drive thru but it's just because it's that good. Eating inside is very loud with loud music and loud employees calling out names for orders. It's just that kind of environment. Doesn't bother us but if you are going out for a nice quite dinner this place is loud. Employees are always friendly. Service is quick when it's your turn. A family of 4 can eat here for about 30 bucks. Also a hidden gem ask for the Louisiana hot sauce and mix it with the Cane's sauce it's amazing. When we dine in there are always employees cleaning so it's a very tidy place. Bathrooms are always clean. They offer a rewards program as well. You can buy shirts and hats as well if your into buying apparel. Love us some chicken fingers!"}
{"text":"I don't like to eat anything fried too much but you can get addicted to these fried chicken strips. I went a few times and each time our meals were hot, fresh and tasty. The portions are big and very filling. You get a side of coleslaw with the crispy fried chicken baskets and there is one that you can get the bread. The bread is great so I order extra. Order extra of the dipping sauce it is almost like a Thousand Island but with a kick (very tasty)."}
{"text":"Those that complain the menu is limited. This is probably the reason why they do it so well. Every location that I have visited, the service was quick &  food was consistently good. Everytime I was there, they always had someone cleaning the tables.  Just compare it to that chicken place with the \"extra crispy\" dude. That place is always dirty & the food seems to get worse every time I go there.  Keep up the great work Raising Canes."}
{"text":"If I could open one of these in San Diego, I'd make a million.  I love Cane's.  I'd never seen one before coming to Vegas, and there's one down the street from my school.  I tend to eat there about once or twice a week.  The chicken tenders are fresh, the fries are always hot, and the Cane's sauce is perfect."}
{"text":"Not only is the ice very bad, but they know it makes the diet sodas undrinkable - and they sell them anyway. I suggested to the manager that until they fix the ice maker, they probably shouldn't put the ice in the sodas; Or in the alternative, they might at least warn their customers that they are spending several dollars on an undrinkable beverage. The manager seemed very annoyed with these suggestions. Apparently, it's not particularly important to the mangers of the franchise to do right by their customers. Buyer beware, do not go to this Raisin Cane's unless you plan to spend at least $27 for the 25 piece deal, and to get a drink somewhere else. All of the combos are a rip off because you will be forced to purchase a particularly gross soda. If you must purchase a combo do not get the diet soda because it tastes like dirty bathwater."}
{"text":"For my bi-annual chicken finger fix, Raising Canes hits the spot. The service is always fast friendly and super organized. The chicken and fries are always hot. The caniac sauce to dip the chicken fingers in is delicious. I love to get 3/4 of unsweet iced tea and mix it with 1/4 sweet iced tea. It's the perfect amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"I have to say that canes has the best chicken fingers and sauce, their also have awesome sweet tea!"}
{"text":"havnt been to this location yet  but if anything like the stapley location,  food is great, staff is friendly    chicken is out of this world tastee!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were absolutely delicious, fresh, crispy, moist and everything you would want a piece of fried chicken to be This was my first time to be here but it will not be my last.  Unfortunately the fries are not nearly as good as they could be when eating such a wonderful piece of chicken.     I ate inside and the staff was friendly and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"went through the drive thru, service was good. ckn was good and soft, very yummy esp. there cane sauce. the fries were mediocre and some were over cooked. not a coleslaw fan. but the toast was good. overall a decent meal for 9.07 that i split with my son. better places out there."}
{"text":"Great food! Fast and friendly service! Restaurant is always busy and they still manage to deliver great service!"}
{"text":"Heard all of the hype, seen all the customers as I passed by. So it finally came time for me to try it. Maybe like most people I love chicken strips. Easy to eat, no bones, crunchy, and reminds of being a kids again eating with my hands, I mean who doesn't like that?! Lol! Well I was surprised by these chicken strips, they were awesome. Juicy, tender, had an amazing crust and crunch! The chicken strips I will say is a 5/5 but what being down my review in whole, is the coleslaw and the sauce. Now the coleslaw is just a side as well as the sauce being an accompanying taste for the chicken strips. But the coleslaw was bland and lacked any real characteristics. It was like a watery mayo dressed cabbage, def was a let down and something I wouldn't get again if I had the choice. Now the sauce, the sauce is ok. My problem? I like variety, with having only one sauce if I didn't like it that would have totally changed the wholeoutcome of the meal. The sauce is good but by the time you are finished with your meal I could have used a second sauce to change things up. The bread, well the bread is just awesome! Nice, soft and buttery! Now into what I believe is best part....the lemonade! Reminds me of hot dog in a stick lemonade but it was great non the less. I'm happy that there is a raising canes near by and I got to try it.  Not bad at all but I know a spot that I'll be going to for chicken strips...MC."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today to see what could be so special about a place that just serves chicken fingers and we didn't get off to a good start.  I placed my order at 11:18 am (time on my receipt), and it was a mostly empty restaurant. The lunch rush had not started yet. I placed my order for a \"Box Combo\" and lemonade and stood by the counter thinking they would call my name. About 10 minutes into my wait I noticed they were bringing the orders to the tables so I went and sat down. I finished my lemonade while I waited and notice there was a charge for a refill so I got some tea instead. At 11:39 my order was brought to me.  The food was pretty good but how the heck does it take 21 minutes to cook chicken fingers and fries when that is all you do?  By the time I left it was very busy and I wondered if those people were waiting longer than I had to when the place wasn't busy? I'll give them another try and see if they are any faster next time."}
{"text":"Fast service and simple menu . Delicious chicken, fries and Texas toast that's always fresh. Raising canes does very little as far as choices goes but does it RIGHT!  ((The toast is my absolute fav part!!)"}
{"text":"While I love the food I am extremely disappointed by the behaviors of the staff. While waiting to pay there were two staff by the drive thru window swearing at each other while the girl that took my card was laughing."}
{"text":"We have been Cane's fans for years. So, to have one open near our home we hit the jackpot right? Not so much! After waiting 35 minutes to order and receive our food, I cannot believe the manager (Asian looking guy) charged me $.58 for honey mustard sauce. Now, it's only $.58 but, you would think, after waiting so long in a crowded room for our food, he would just hand me the sauce.  He had me go back in line to pay for 2 ramifikins of sauce.  I don't think in our years of eating Canes (at other locations) we have ever been charged for sauce.  So, food 5 stars, service 2 stars, Manager 0 stars equals 1 star total. -Signed, Canes fan except for the North Las Vegas local."}
{"text":"Their food is yummy! The food selection is small and they don't carry regular condiments like ranch or bbq sauce."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers seem like a while chicken cutlet cut in half. Since their so big they're not crispy, in fact it was soggy."}
{"text":"This is the second Cane's I've ever been to and it was just as delicious as I remembered it.  Great price, great chicken strips.  Their iced tea is pretty yummy, too.  They have sweet and unsweet."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken!  Love the dipping sauce.  Really good for fast food.  Like the service there too.  Never had a problem.  definitely going again."}
{"text":"I tend to come here on Sundays when Chick Fil A is closed, lol, and they never disappoint. The bread that comes with your meal was dunked in heaven before its served to you!! Deelish."}
{"text":"This is the only Cane's I've been to. Loved it from the start. We live right down the road so it's way too convenient cuz I want it all the time. Lol. Best chicken, fries, Texas toast and Sauce EVER!! I love the restaurant inside too. Super busy and fast. Managers were nice and staff was on it!"}
{"text":"The facility is clean, staff is very welcoming.  Ehhhh, mediocre chicken strips in my opinion. I've definitely had better with way more flavor. BUT the fries and the sauce here are absolutely delicious. They're also a little bit pricey."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is the \"In N Out\" of chicken.  They have only chicken, fries, cole slaw and toast, but all of it is well made, tastes good and works well together as a full meal.  The service at all the RCs is well above average and often better than that. Aa an example, when I wanted order a couple of extra items, the cashier suggested that I get the next level of box which was less expensive and more convenient.  They keep the place clean and work hard getting the orders out promptly. Overall RCs delivers on what it promises."}
{"text":"Massive quantities of most excellent and delicious food.  Super clean restaurant. Friendly staffers.  Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Me and my family love canes but this location is sad representation of it.First it takes forever through the drive thru my chicken was over cooked I asked for ketchup and didn't receive any and most of the people working the drive thru don't seem like they know what they're doing please get a couple of the people from the st rose location to help this poor excuse for a canes"}
{"text":"My first time here and will definitely be back. The drive thru was packed but it moved pretty fast. The welcome was hilarious and upbeat. The staff was nice and very friendly. Chicken was crispy and lightly battered which was nice since a lot of places will cake on the batter. The lemonade was cold and refreshing and the meal was nice and hot. We will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"You can get chicken tenders and fries anywhere. I come here for the Canes SAUCE like everybody else. I'm a Caniac, I have almost all the mercy & have eaten at almost every AZ location and even drove an hour to get canes when I lived in Los Angeles. After a long day of work I finally get to go for my canes. I buy FOUR sauces. They repeated back to me \"four?\" I say yes. Low and behold the ONE time I don't check my order when I'm leaving because I'm in such a good mood that I finally got canes I go home to find ONE cane sauce. Are you kidding?? It's takes 1 1/2 just for my fries! I was charged for them & now am left with a broken heart. It sucks because I know I'll be back there again next week craving the sauce. You guys suck at this location."}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers.    but very pricey  If you buy the tenders individually.  No sauce.  Extra charge   C'mon!      glad they stay open till midnight   Chicken fingers small.  But yummy"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. I love everything about this place!  For a place that's always busy, they're on top of their game! Not only do they move through the line very quickly, they also deliver very quickly.  My food has always been hot and fresh! I get the 3 finger combo, and can never finish it! Priced less than most fast food places, better quality food. I love the food, service, and environment. If you're a fan of chicken fingers and French Fries, they are among the leading 2."}
{"text":"Always good, quick and hot! Be careful they come out VERY hot sometimes. We get extra toast and no coleslaw with no up charge.  We are weekly happy customers"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim, there's always a line. Simple menu-all chicken finger combos and crinkle fries. Sweet tea over Lemonade both are pretty sweet! Chicken is lightly breaded, not over seasoned and fries weren't greasy. Late hours are a bonus."}
{"text":"Having read the reviews pros and cons, I had to try this chicken myself. The chicken tenders were moist just right, sorry Col. Sanders but your best chicken tenders can't touch these. Even their fry's were well done. My only Con is the Texas toast, just cause I am not a big fan of this toast. The toast was very tender. Really enjoyed the Canes sauce. The plus Great Chicken tenders and a Free Caniac club card worth  it.   Update 5-19-18  Having coming to canes since 2016 this place is still the best. I recently had a minor issue. The management responded quickly and are extremely nice. Thank you Laci and Todd for your most wonderful service. I recommend Everyone to try these golden chicken fingers.....very very addicting."}
{"text":"So I'm a Caniac I love this place took my son's out here when they were on spring break from Becky's and they loved it canes you are the greatest in the East Valley can't be beat can't have it every day but the times that you do have it it is awesome don't slack on what your quality or quantity of food is this is what everybody's looking forward to"}
{"text":"Finally !!! Been living here for almost two years and always had to travel out of my way like 20 minutes. I finally have one that is 10 minutes away in a straight shot. The dining room in this location is very big and can surely accommodate a big crowd of people. Opening week was pretty busy, but when is canes not every busy?? The lines were wrapping around the building for drive thru so I can see that I wasn't the only one excited. Opted to go inside and the line was long as well! Staff was very friendly and the food was coming out fast! Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I'd heard all about this place and man did it let me down. Chicken is flavorless and the French fries were unsalted and soggy. I asked for bbq sauce and was told there was only Canes sauce. Tasted like they'd thrown a few bland sauces together. $5.99 thrown away."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best chicken places to eat in all of Arizona the whole family goes nuts for the hardhat The sauce is amazing the fries oh my God and the breading for the chicken strips unbelievable"}
{"text":"I like canes when im in the mood for chicken strips. I just wish they had more options to choose from. The last time i was there i watched a girl bring my food to the wrong table. After a minute of the guy digging around in my plate he realised it wasnt his and brought it back. I watched them grab that same plate set it on the back counter and then pick it back up immediately and bring it back out to the floor to try and serve it to me. Kind of ruined the experience for me"}
{"text":"Very good for a chicken strip place. Their bread is pretty good, the slaw and fries are pretty bland and unexciting, but the chicken fingers are awesome, their sauce goes well with everything and is pretty good. If you get a little hot sauce from them it is pretty good as well. Prices are about a dollar more than they should be in my opinion, but it's always clean and the staff is pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"When you say \"chicken tenders\" one would expect chicken tenders, not chicken nuggets. Come on Canes, if you are going to do ONE thing right, the least you can do is get it right."}
{"text":"Honestly place is very clean and very busy all the time from right when they open to right when they close. Sometimes you can tell when the chicken isn't fresh and has been sitting around and also the fries. When it's the best is when it's so hot you can't even bite into it without burning your mouth other times you can tell it's been sitting out and just cold. The bread is my favorite part of the meal you can exchange a couple things depends on what you order I exchange the slaw for an extra piece of bread. The iced tea is also another thing to try so sweet so good! The freshness needs to be fixed also add some ranch? Or more sauces for the dish. They have this special sauce that is good but ranch or some bbq sauce would be good at times also. Customer service is okay not something I can really talk about. Place is cool way better than KFC."}
{"text":"Great Chicken fingers! Reminds me of Zaxby's or Guthries back east. Military discount.  Good customer service. Just fix the drive-thru/ parking issues."}
{"text":"Man they still have customer service issues. I can't get more than 2 words out with out the cashier turning her head to yell something to the kitchen. It would be nice to get my whole order out before they start yelling it back to the kitchen. Not sure why they have to yell they have a computer right in front that shows my order to the kitchen.  Then she seems angry and is slamming her register door and never once smiled at all.  This location has a lot to learn about training their employees on customer service."}
{"text":"Very good mmmyummy sauce and chicken fingers. The service was quick and kind. Its a lot of food, got the  meal 4pc. and drink."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is the definition of knowing your brand, honing in on a small menu and high quality product. The food is always good and always fresh. It is generally always consistent, sometimes small details or modifications slip through the cracks, but in general this location is reliable.   Cane's fresh-squeezed lemonade is handily winning the competition against their other (fried) chicken rival, much more balanced and less bracing acidity. This is literally the ONLY fast food place where my boyfriend and I get our own drinks because I HAVE to have it! And my newest addiction there (on the recommendation of an employee) is double buttered bread- it takes the already carb loading meal to a whole new level of toasty indulgence!  If you happen to be in a hurry, choose the drive thru. After being a somewhat regular patron of dine in, carry out, and drive thru, I feel I can confidently say the drive thru will almost always go faster than carry out unless there is the rare occasion of an emptier dining room."}
{"text":"Perfect every time! I have avoided trying this place because it was a chain, but I tried them about 6 months ago and can't get enough. I crave it at least every other week, but don't give in that often. When I am on the area, I have an excuse...  I love this chicken. The texas toast. The sauce. I love that you can substitute bread for the Cole slaw. So if you get the 4 piece and sub the slaw, you can get two Texas toasts. This is such a great flexibility that they offer.   The smell in your vehicle while driving this chicken home just might get to you or one of your passengers. It may prevent that chicken from arriving safely at your destination. :)  yum"}
{"text":"The soft drinks taste like soap.  Horrible.   Chicken is alright.  Slow drive thru line.  I won't be going back.  Go to the Chick-fil-A that's a couple miles north on Stephanie instead.  No soapy drinks there."}
{"text":"Karlee J is one of the WORST employees I have ever came in contact with, STOP LYING to customers! I am thoroughly disappointed with my experience, I will never return to this location. Thanks, Bye!"}
{"text":"Yum! I seriously love me some Raising Cane's. The drive-thru at this location is fast and efficient. And placing a large catering order is quick and easy. Everything we ordered was easily transportable and packaged nicely. Tip: Get an extra Cane's sauce with your order - it's delicious to dip the fries in."}
{"text":"I love Cane's! The food is FANTASTIC. This specific location is by far the best one I've been to and it's close to home. First, the employees seemed to enjoy being at work. The workflow was efficient even during this busy time. The place was very clean unlike other locations I've been to. Overall, a great addition to Surprise."}
{"text":"We love Cane's Chicken Fingers. They offer larger chicken tenders, battered and fried to crispy perfection. Dip them in their signature sauce. We don't care for the Cole Slaw, so we request for another helping of crinkle fries. My daughter and I usually share a Caniac Combo: 6 chicken fingers, 2 helpings of fries, yummy, scrummy Texas Toast, buttered, of course, and a tall glass of freshly squeezed lemonade.   Tip: They also have a rewards program that offers great freebies on the card on various occasions including your birthday.  We love Cane's!  p/s The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"This location takes FOREVER! do not go here unless you want to sit in line for thirty minutes even when there are only three cars ahead of you. Ridiculous! Even the location by ASU (which is always flooded with people) is WAY faster"}
{"text":"Love the chicken.  So moist and tender.  The dipping sauce is great too.  Boxes come with Cole slaw, fries and Texas toast.  Well, because I don't eat the toast I find out after the fact that you can swap it for an extra sauce which I will do in the future because you don't get enough.  It's 35 cents for an extra otherwise.  The coleslaw isn't sweet at all.   I had the lemonade and it was delicious.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I got my drive thru order incorrect. The first time, they offered to replace the entire order. I thought that was very kind of them even though it was only a part of my order that was incorrect. I ordered an 1 extra cane sauce and 3 chicken fingers alongside my sandwich combo. It is partly my fault for not checking before I leave the drive thru, but if you purchase something from an esteemed establishment, you would expect everything you ordered would be in the bag. When I got home, I open the box of extra fingers for my nephew and there it was-- 3 cane sauce and 1 chicken finger. I called the location and Heather was real nice about it. I decide to go back a few days later to claim my complimentary meal for my incorrect order. I stay in the drive thru line while they check if my complaint is legit. The manager, didn't catch his name but this was in the late evening, gave me some attitude because of what Heather told me about comping my meal. No apology. Just attitude I didn't ask for. Pretty sure I did not order a feisty manager for your staff's mistake, little guy.  ??????????????????????  This second time, not even that far between (I come here often ), I order the same thing. Same exact order. Sandwich combo + 1 extra cane sauce + 3 fingers. I get home, and there's 1 sauce and 1 finger. Can't be real right? I took a picture and sent it to my brother and he just laughs! I called and spoke to a Derek. I tell Derek what happens and he asks for the rest of my order. My order is pretty specific because I ask for extra lettuce in my sandwich. He places me on hold to check what happened. Whoever put the order together claimed to put 3 fingers in the box. Derek says, \"It must have gotten switched around. They remember your order specifically  because of the extra lettuce and putting 3 fingers in the box.\" Judging from the rest of these reviews, Derek, your location is notorious for getting orders incorrect, leaving out the toast, and misunderstanding orders in the line. I told him, \"Do you suppose they just fell out of the sealed box and out of the plastic bag that it's in?!\" I think he sensed the sarcasm and said he would gladly replace the missing fingers.  Think I'd rather drive a couple more minutes down the road to Chick-Fil-A where my chicken craving being fulfilled is their pleasure."}
{"text":"Far better than that other chicken place down the street.  The chicken is fresh and not s pressed chicken by product.  However the music is so loud you can't have a conversation. Everyone is trying to talk over the music and it makes dining in unbearable."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for chicken. The lemonade is one of a kind and the service is good. I love going here with my family because there is no issues about who wants what. You get the best tasting chicken, perfect size fries, coleslaw and Texas toast, the  \"Caniac combo\". The piece of resistance the SAUCE, its to die for,  LOVE IT! I've been coming to this location for several years but I've always had good experience at other locations."}
{"text":"Great fast food. The lemonade is great.  Best chicken strips for a fast food place."}
{"text":"I love the food here. But this place is so busy. I think I entered disneyland. Waiting 20-30 minutes to order food is ridiculous. Also the last few times, I ordered food. They screwed up my order. They overcharge for sodas. I think they should offer discounts, on combos for repeat customers.To help attract more business.  Thanks."}
{"text":"I can't believe how much hype there is about this place. The wife and I went. Let me tell ya we can make way better chicken fingers then they can. It's just mediocre to us. The chicken really isn't seasoned just some flour and drop the suckers down. Now at home we season are bad boys right. So back to the experience, we asked for different sauce to dip in and nope. Really and chicken place with no other dip. Holy smokes. Never mind we are never going back thanks but no thanks. I wouldn't even want this chicken if it free."}
{"text":"Got Canes from the location in Surprise that just opened by my house and was super happy with the turn out! My fiancé and I love Canes and our order was perfect! We tend to get more of the sauce than most people usually do and they were really nice about it and even put all the extra sauce in a little to go container. Overall great experience we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location four times, twice eating inside and twice using the drive-thru. The dining quality and service on each occasion was top-notch. The drive-thru line moves quicker than ordering inside but not by much. Service with a smile is the rule and not an exception. All-in-all, this is one of the great fast food restaurants of our time."}
{"text":"Ordered a bunch of food with friends one order had 2 caniacs and only had one. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I often order catering for my work, and I decided to use this restaurant and give it a try! I mean who doesn't love fried chicken right? Well this place is amazing! My large order was happily accepted and taken by Manager John, he was absolutely wonderful! I had changed my order twice, and he continued to accommodate my demands. Absolutely wonderful! The food was amazing and everyone loved it! Little to no left overs! I had forgotten to get the lemonade and tea gallons from him, and he actually sent someone to drive them to me, and gave me a free combo certificate. I can't say it enough! Absolutely wonderful! We will most definitely be ordering catering from John and his team again!"}
{"text":"I dunno what happened but I got baby chicken fingers it seems, in both boxes! Running low on chicken guys or what?"}
{"text":"The wait is incredibly long because the employees working the cash register have no idea what they're doing. I understand you're new but all you have to do is LISTEN! How many different ways can I say caniac combo but make all the sides fries. Why does that mean add two fries on top of the order? It just means don't give me anything for sides but fries. And when I say another caniac combo with two toast and fries as the sides why do you have to call the manager? This is the same exact order I always order at any canes. It took 30 minutes going inside. Avoid at all freaking costs. Train your employees better. She didn't even ask me if I'd like anything else. I had to interrupt her when she was giving me my total to ask for order additional items. I also usually get a lemonade as a drink but she obviously was so confused and in such a rush to take my order incorrectly that I didn't want to further complicate her job and add it. I shouldn't have to tell you that you should ask if there's anything else I'd like to add to my order before giving me my total.  To top it off even after the manager came and told her how to do it she still did it wrong and my order was still wrong. Why don't you understand what two toast one fry means?!??!??? Why did I get fries, toast, and slaw? Why?!? Super frustrating"}
{"text":"Great portions and loved the dipping sauce The simplicity of the menu was nice and the decor was interesting."}
{"text":"Clean place to eat. Friendly service. The food is delicious and always fresh and fast. The only thing I dislike is there are tables directly in front of the drinking fountain and it feels cramped right there."}
{"text":"Awesome staff at this location. A friend and I opted to eat in because we didn't want to wait in the drive thru lane. We had a wonderful time! Great staff and  good food. Neil was super kind (and I think the other guy's name was Marcus) but they all had a great attitude."}
{"text":"I got the caniac combo which had plenty of food which is always nice.  The fingers were good but seemed a little bland without the sauce which is weird because I don't usually like the sauce.  It definitely needed it this time though.  It was peppery and tasty but a bit heavy.  The fries were bland as well unfortunately.  The texas toast was good and I always look forward to it.  The coleslaw wasn't bad either.  All in all it was an ok meal but the craving I had for it kind of faded when I was eating it.  The staff though were super friendly and bubbly which I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Came in during teacher appreciation day. Long line but management and staff were on their toes. For the amount of customers in line I was trully impressed but their team work. Thanks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Shout out to this past Sunday's night crew ! Awesome service and fresh tenders!! They even had little puppy milkbones for my mutlies!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and was pleasantly surprised. The chicken strips were very tastey and the chicken was moist-no rubber chicken here. Prices weren't out of line either."}
{"text":"Good chicken fingers and dipping sauce.  I love the bread.  basic food but it's good."}
{"text":"Not impressed. My chicken batter was raw and the honey mustard sauce was bland. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"I love this place! This was my \"go to\" lunch whenever I was attending courses at the Army JAG School in Charlottesville, VA.  I was very excited to see the Chandler location opening only about a my from where I live!  Chicken is always cooked perfectly, with a nice, light, coating. The chicken is always tender and juicy. Paired with the Cane Sauce, HOME RUN! Simple menu done consistently well! They'll even make you an Arnold Palmer with the lemonade and iced tea!  The staff I've dealt with have all been courteous, friendly, and had a welcoming smile! Great job!"}
{"text":"The chicken strips are tough and overcooked. It could be because they are slice so thin-not much meat! There really isn't much flavor to the breading on the chicken strips and they taste like they are cooked in old oil. Even though they send an email with Caniac specials, you still have to present the Caniac card to get the deal. All other restaurants that I go to, you only have to present the email on your phone. Prefer the sauces to Chick-Fil-A. I have eaten there three times and I doubt that I will return. I am not impressed with there Chicken!"}
{"text":"Have an addiction problem? Then you're Not gonna wanna eat here, cause THIS FOOD IS ADDICTING!! :)  Awesome chicken fingers, great dipping sauce, killer Texas toast! What more could you ask for?!?!!! (How about some of their thirst quenching fresh squeezed lemonade?!!)   Love this place. Try it out  (Note: it is a fast food place... But it's dang good fast food)"}
{"text":"The slaw and fries are just ok the Texas toast is bad the tenders are fair but I weighed the four that came with the meal 8 oz's Albertsons are better and 1 pound is $5.99 and slaw is better, our two four piece meals cost over $16 dollars will not go back!"}
{"text":"Saturday I picked up a family member from the emergency room and though she was in pain from the stitches ,she stated she wanted some chicken strips so I figured I would call ahead for the 25 piece and be in and out no problem.  Well they answered and put me on hold for 22 min. I was still on hold when I got there and yes they were jam packed and of course I had to drive off but the fact that no one picked the phone up and left me on hold that long shows that the customer service is Horse shit. Great chicken though."}
{"text":"If you like chicken fingers and fries, this is your place!  Basic menu - clean restaurant and restrooms - courteous staff and a brand new location in Surprise. This place will do well."}
{"text":"You guys allowed me to have a great dinner after a nearby restaurant ruined my night :)  Thank you guys"}
{"text":"1 or 2 people who aren't the friendliest people on shift, but RURY (manager) was amazing. I told him the sweet tea I purchased wasn't great, he compensated me & had excellent customer service. Polite and sincere, even dealing with a customer bragging about some stupid French Fries not being fresh. He was amazing. Dont forget to mention the military discount ;)"}
{"text":"Lemonade is good, and bread is too but chicken comes out soggy sometimes. Idk why this keeping happening, but that last three times I ordered from the drive through they ask if I want ketchup and I say \"please\" with some happiness as to if I get ketchup I'd be very happy. I don't know why but I don't get ketchup. It sucks cause now I don't have any ketchup to eat my food with."}
{"text":"Love coming to Cane's!!! They have good chicken strips! Also their sauce is amazing! I love getting the box combo because it comes with coleslaw. You can also exchange the coleslaw or Texas toast for cane sauce or extra toast.  If you want extra cane sauce you need to pay for it, it's 35 cents.   -The 3 finger combo comes with 3 chicken strips, fries, texas toast & cane sauce & a drink. -The box combo comes with 4 chicken strips, fries, texas toast, cane sauce, coleslaw & a drink.  -The caniac combo comes with 6 pieces of chicken strips, fries, texas toast, coleslaw, 2 cane sauces & a large drink.  -They also have a chicken sandwhich combo.  -As well they have a kids meal combo.   They have a patio to sit outside. Also it gets pretty packed here. Also they cater."}
{"text":"Food is great! Waited in drive thru for 30 mins on opening day though which was a bummer. Caniac combo was delicious, sauce and chicken were on point with the other locations. Only problem was the ice gave my orange soda a funny taste. Hopefully its just a one time thing"}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers I ever had!  Everything in the box combos is good. Just pick how many fingers you want lol.   Service is good. Parking good.  Nice décor of old school movies and dogs.  Wish we had Canes in Cali dam it! Its all good another excuse to come back to AZ."}
{"text":"Usually not a huge fan of chains but this place is solid. The takeout line is killer. The drive-thru is even worse. But theyre always Right on the money when it comes to killer chicken.  As if having great chicken isnt enough,  They have some super serious badass sauce. Holy cow. Skip the tea--the sauce is my drink of choice.  I wish they had more branches in the Valley, but theyre actually worth driving a little further to reach if you have the time."}
{"text":"I love them! That is all! I'm just gonna drop the mic and leave. No, seriously I love their food. I don't eat meat anymore but still love their fries. When I ate meat I fell in love with this location. My first time trying raising canes was at this location last May"}
{"text":"First time at this Raising Cane's. Picked up 25 pieces, eight sauces for $30. Seems a little steep for chicken with no sides.   It was ready in 8 minutes.   The food was fine: breaded chicken strips, fried up and served in a box. Tough to screw up. Not much flavor, just fried chicken strips. The sauce is a variation of thousand island dressing but with more vinegar.   Cane's is good for feeding a crowd, just don't expect 11 herbs and spices."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, I love canes food my fries were a little over cooked but they were still pretty tasty. What I didn't like was the customer service. My boyfriend had accidentally dropped his lemonade on the table and one of the girls that worked there saw us trying to clean it up and the only thing that we needed help was cleaning up the floor because we cleaned up most of the table. But the girl just saw us and walked away. We had to go up to the front and let them know that we spilled lemonade. Afterwards I went up front cause they didn't even offer us a refill since we dropped it. I went up front and said \"excuse me do you think I can get a refill?\" And she just looked at me then walked away she came back and said yeah so she refilled it without ice and I asked her if she could add ice. She also gave it to me without a lid and straw and I just walked away got it myself which I didn't mind, but this location doesn't have the greatest customer service. They have better customer service through the drive through than eating in. Also the girl at the cash register seemed so bland like she didn't want to be there. Personally I think customer service means a lot I know that where I'm employed it is very important and mentioned to us constantly how important it is. Maybe they don't apply it as much at this location,but they should."}
{"text":"Raising Canes is a family favorite. Great food, great prices, the best sweet tea you can get outside of homemade.   Taking away a star because the place is always crazy busy no matter what time you go, but the employees and service is always consistent so it doesn't detract too much from the experience."}
{"text":"Love Canes! The cashier was funny & kind. Everything is good, the chicken, the fries & their sauce! Even the lemonade, some people come here just for that.   I love getting the box combo because it comes with 4 pieces of chicken strips also it comes with coleslaw, sauce, toast & a drink. You can replace the coleslaw with another sauce or toast if you like.   They also have 3 other meals   3 finger combo which they don't give you coleslaw but they still give you fries & sauce & 3 pieces of chicken strips.   A chicken sandwich but they put chicken strips between 2 buns.   A caniac combo that comes with 6 pieces of chicken strips & 2 sauces.   You can also cater.  They also have kids meals   There's shirts & hats you can buy."}
{"text":"Don't really understand the appeal of this place. Chicken was fine, but certainly nothing worth raving about. And with nothing else on the menu other than the strips or sandwiches made with strips, there just really isn't much to say here.  Their signature Cane's sauce? Meh. Would've loved some BBQ sauce. Anything to add a little spice and flavor to some relatively bland chicken.   I don't really understand why people would bother packing this place out when Chick Fil A is across the street. Unless it's Sunday, of course."}
{"text":"The total highlight of this place is definitely their chicken fingers and their sweet tea. Couldnt have asked for better chicken fingers. My husband brought them home on the fly. I can't really comment in the fries. They were mush by the time they got to my house (maybe better when super fresh??) I also wasn't wowed by the coleslaw. It's your run of the mill Sysco coleslaw. For an Idaho girl, I loved their special sauce. It was like a zesty fry sauce."}
{"text":"The food is very good very fairly priced not as clean as I would like it to be and it was super busy there was nowhere to sit I would recommend going there to anybody really really good food if you like chicken"}
{"text":"Other locations have been great and this Avondale location is unfortunately the only one. I'm going to make it a rule that I never go to this one ever again. Giving an attitude is not good in my book and one of the cashiers definitely did it this time. What a bitchy attitude and probably straight out of high school. Never again will I set foot in this establishment."}
{"text":"The chicken and their sauce is amazing, but the one thing I can't stand is their speaker through the drive thru, it drives me crazy that I can't ever hear them. I feel like I have to make them repeat themselves couple times, although I feel bad I think it's their speakers fault."}
{"text":"People were very friendly. Not much on the menu but hey why not keep it simple. The chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. What will keep calling me back is the cane sauce and Texas toast."}
{"text":"I went to Cane's last night for the first time after a co-worker raved to me how good this place is.  I went through the drive thru so my review is solely based on the food and service in the drive thru.  I went to Cane's and bought dinner for myself and co-workers.  The service was adequate nothing special but nothing unpleasant.  The food came out quickly and I brought it back to work.  Big boxes and chicken sandwiches.  The presentation of the food was not that good.  Of course the styrofoam container is expected so that is not a factor in my rating.  The food was basically just tossed in the container.  I guess from a fast food place this would be the normal presentation.  There was such a big piece of lettuce on the sandwiches that it was literally sticking out the edges of the container, and it really wasn't a nice tasting piece of lettuce.  It wasn't crisp.  It was tough....yuck.  The bun was an egg type bun.  The same as a grocery store that you can get 8 for $3-$4.  The sandwich itself was $3.99. The \"special\" Cane sauce was nothing special at all.  The sandwich itself would have been better with mayo or BBQ on it, in my opinion.  The chicken strips here are awesome.  Real chicken, not processed and compressed chicken parts, seasoned and cooked perfect.  However, the 3 laid on this partially sauced, yucky lettuce bun was awkward to eat. I enjoyed mine by just eating the chicken fingers and leaving the rest of the \"sandwich\".  Now the box.  The fries were nothing special.  Basic bought frozen, deep fried crinkle cut fries with more salt on them than needed.  They weren't gross but were just basic fries nothing special about them.  The cole slaw my co-workers liked was not good in my opinion.  I took one bite and that was the end of that.  The Texas toast was a soggy piece of sesame seed bread.  The chicken fingers were awesome though.  At least the signature item is on point here.  There should be an option for BBQ sauce or something aside from this signature Cane sauce.  I would return for the chicken fingers and maybe some fries with them.  The rest of what I had eaten here I would not eat again."}
{"text":"So this raising canes is getting two stars because of the consistent lack of fries they offer. They make it look like a lot of fries by placing it on top of the chicken. This is the only location that provides so little compared to the other locations in town."}
{"text":"So dang yummy & friendly service. It's something my whole family will eat and no one complains. We've also bought this for parties or for something to bring to a party to contribute. It goes well for a children's theme or adult. I love that the menu is simple. You have to try the Texas toast and the secret sauce is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Overall: 4/5  I'm not a huge chicken strip person (skip the strips and pass me the wings hahahahaha), so I was a little skeptical coming here. I was expecting your typical stringy chicken covered with heavy breading....boy was I wrong! This place had me falling in love with chicken strips and craving it more and more. They just have the perfect recipe for how to do chicken strips right!!!!  Definitely have to suggest the Caniac Combo...don't think 3 or 4 of these tasty morsels are enough for me.  I wish the fries were a bit crispier and the coleslaw was a bit slaw-ier, but these are tiny gripes in an otherwise delicious and addicting meal.  plus this location has a Sundevil in their logo...how could you go wrong?!?!? GO DEVILS!!!!!  Service: 5/5  I have to say that I was pretty impressed with their service. I have been here a couple of times and the service for both indoor and drive thru are both very friendly and helpful. During my family's first time here we surprisingly had many questions about their menu (even though they really only sell strips or a sandwich) and the girl taking our order was very patient and helpful with her answers and suggestions.  The drive thru was just as friendly, if not more so, than the workers inside. Don't think I've heard a more cheerful drive thru person in my life...quite a nice surprise.  Cleanliness: 4/5  I do have to knock their cleanliness a bit. The table we chose was a bit dirty and I had to end up wiping the table off with napkins. It's a fast food joint, it's to be expected. Other than the dirty table everything else seemed very clean and tidy.  Food: 4.5/5  This is where Raising Canes shined for me. The chicken was incredibly moist and tender, not stringy or tough, and the breading on top was surprisingly thin but very crispy. The breading to chicken ratio was PERFECT.  The canes sauce? Don't even get me started...I'm definitely a sauce man and love my sauces. This was the perfect accompaniment for my awesome chicken strips! I usually like a selection of sauces for my chicken...a little bit of ranch, a little bit of BBQ, maybe throw in some hot sauce...NOPE, just give me some Canes sauce from now on!!!!  I was told by my wife and brother that their sweet tea was out of this world. I don't drink tea so I can't say first hand, but if you like tea perhaps give the sweet tea a try.  I do have to knock them a bit because I wasn't a fan of their French fries. They were a little too soggy and flimsy for my taste. I would have liked them a bit crispier. I also didn't care for the coleslaw either. It tasted more like a cabbage salad than a coleslaw to me.  Cons:  Fries were a bit soggy and flimsy Was not a fan of the coleslaw Sorry couldn't put the strips down so I have no idea how good the sandwich is."}
{"text":"Oh Canes, so i was hesitant to try this place because im not a chicken finger type of person; however, my nephew (who is 6) swore by this place and yeah i know what ur thinking a 6 year old why would you believe a 6 yr old, well this 6 yr old is very very picky about food he doesnt like Mcdonalds what kid doesnt like mcdonalds?! Anyways i tried it with him and man is it good and cheap for the amount of food and quality of food you get.  Not to mention that this place now made me enjoy chicken fingers and the sauce is delish."}
{"text":"I must add that the Cane's I visited was the. Avondale location....one thing that was good was the customer service at this location!"}
{"text":"Especially enjoyed the wheat beer. It was a fairly decent food truck menu. Beware of the alcohol limitations though. We were in on business meetings and were required to drink less than \"brewery policy\" due to house rules... Somewhat disconcerting. I hope they change that soon. Being from Phoenix, I'll give it at 3, but being ABQ that could be concerned to a 3.5."}
{"text":"This place just opened by my house and I was curious to see what the hype was about since there are always cars in the drive thru. I went tonight through the drive thru and waited patiently like everyone else. As I was giving the girl my order she quickly cut me off and gave me a total. I told her I wasn't finished and she rushed through the rest of my order. We get our food but half the order is missing. We waited at the window for an extra 20 minutes for them to make the other half of our order. The employees were inside scrambling around like crazy and acted like they didn't even know what to do. Now I know why the line is so long in the drive thru. Tasting the chicken, it was good but average,very small amount of fries given and small chicken fingers for the price. I do not understand what people love about this place. I am really disappointed that this restaurant is taking up such a large building in a cool new Shopping Center. I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Thia place ia great... absolutely the best chicken at a chain restaurant you can get! Go here weekly and quality is always top notch!"}
{"text":"The food is ok here, chicken tenders were juicy and decent sized. The 4 piece combo was enough to fill me up, definitely not a full meal.   Fries were fresh and crispy, don't see these types of fries often but delicious. The sauce they give also goes well with the fires and the chicken tenders. Thought the pretzel bread (if its supposed to be pretzel bread) was kinda salty. Cole slaw was good and fresh. It's fast food, you get what you expect!   Extra sauce is 31cents. what a random number.."}
{"text":"1st & Not! The last time here!  The chicken fingers are so full of flavor and Amazing in taste outside perfectly crispy and what I LOVE is its not badly Greece at all! The fries are cooked perfect not burnt or to hard the bread hat comes with it had the perfect tastes."}
{"text":"Kids love it and it's simple, Canes only makes 4 things, chicken strips, toast, fries and cole slaw.  Special sauce is delicious.  It is the one place where at least my kids won't complain and as an adult if I have to eat chicken strips these are tasty esp with special sauce."}
{"text":"Who can resist a southern style joint with that friendly feel, tasty chicken, and sweet tea?!  Raising Cane's is always hopping...think In 'n Out on it's busy afternoons.  Every time, you are warmly greeted by almost everyone who works there and they address you by name (after getting it from you at the counter).    Their famous sauce definitely makes it.  I've been a couple times now and only one time did I get dry chicken.  The other visits were made of juicy chicken strips!  You get a lot of food even if you only order their 3-piece, so be cautious of The Box with chicken, coleslaw, fries, and toast.    Try out their sweet tea or order yourself a lemonade (you have to ask when you order since the lemonade isn't out for you to get yourself)."}
{"text":"Just visited Canes for the first time.  The staff was courteous, prompt, well informed and genuinely nice.  The manager Emily was very nice as well. We very much enjoyed the food, it was hot, crispy and very tasty.  There was not a long wait.  The Cane I story was very cute as we are dog people and the decor was fun.  It was well kept and clean.  We will visit again."}
{"text":"came from Cali a and my pops and sis love this place it was average .....the lemonade policy sucks they don't tell its a extra 32¢ then when u ask for a refill they wanted 85¢ the communication sucks on that like u already ask extra the way they handle it suck just push me out the door why don't u"}
{"text":"This location just opened about 2-3 wks ago. I was extremely surprised with how much people were dining inside! So busy that their lobby was packed with no available tables and with the drive thru wrapped around.   With that being said, it took me a good 10 mins to reach the counter where a girl named Alicia took my order. Her computer crapped out and she turned her back on me without saying \"give me one second or sorry for the wait\" ... she was mumbling things under her breath about how her register sucks and how the managers never listen to her/come when they're being called. I found that to be such a turn off because when I looked up to see where the managers were, one was busy helping out the drive thru and the other with the cooks to make the process go faster. It wasn't like they were just standing around! See, if she had just told me what was going on with her register, I would have gladly waited. Bad mouthing her managers in front of a customer is just unprofessional.   The lobby was clearly messy because of the amount of people that were there. Their trash was over flowing and no one was bussing the tables for others to use. They were getting orders wrong, skipping those who ordered before others, and all the workers faces were clearly showed that they were over it.   I think the employees here were clearly unprepared for a busy crowd. Their service and sense of urgency needs some improvement.   On a brighter note, I got my Caniac Combo just the way I like it. No slaw, extra toast (buttered on both sides), fries and bird extra crispy, to go. I recommend their lemonade, light ice, even though I know how much sugar they put in those."}
{"text":"Can this come to San Jose, CA please?!   The chicken fingers at Raising Cane's are hands down the best fast-food chicken tenders I've had. The breading on the chicken is very crispy and flaky. The chicken is super moist. My friends and I concluded that Raising Cane's have got to be brining the chicken to achieve that level of moistness especially for white meat. Even the sides were all very good. I was a fan of the house sauce, which was like a peppery thousand island. The Texas Toast was so soft and buttery, and Raising Cane's coleslaw was as good as KFC's coleslaw. My only complaint, which is more of a preference thing than anything anyway, was that the crisscut fries could have used an extra 10 seconds of deep frying. They were a bit too soft for my liking."}
{"text":"Great food.  Ordered the combo box and enjoyed every bit of it. I should've gotten an extra sauce though. It came with 4 strips, fries, Cole slaw, and buttery Texas toast. Military get a 20% discount, which saved me $1.44."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken sandwich which is delicious.  The food quality and for the price I personally think is excellent.  I'm solely giving this rating on my experience this time.  I asked for the sauce on the side and two mayo packets.  I checked and the mayo packets were in the bag; so I figured so was the canes sauce.  Should have looked deeper because I got home and there was no canes sauce on the side.  Which was really disappointing for me.  Thats what you're known for is the sauce.  Thats what makes it that much better.  And the only complaint I would have about the sandwich, is that the lettuce was really wilty.  Which I get lettuce and a hot sandwich but it was to the point where it looked disgusting.  Maybe try a different lettuce or maybe I just got the bad piece.  I definitely will be back but I will make sure to check for all my sauces this time."}
{"text":"I typically go to the Canes in Glendale and have had nothing but great experiences with the managers and cashiers. I live in Surprise and when I found out they were building one out here I was so excited.   Unfortunately, the Canes in Surprise is a let down compared to the Glendale location. Every time I make substitutions to a meal the cashiers have no idea how to ring it up and it takes 5-10 minutes to find a manager and train them on the spot on how to make substitutions to my order. This has happened many times already.  The next problem I have with this location is their \"sweet tea\". The tea at the Glendale location is ALWAYS sweet and never disappoints. The tea at the Surprise location is hardly sweet and sometimes tastes as if they didn't sweeten it at all. Overall it's very unsatisfying compared to other locations. The sweet tea is a big reason why I go to Canes so it's just disappointing.   The last issue I have with the Canes in Surprise is the management. The other night I went to Canes and ordered a box combo with a large sweet tea. Again, the cashier did not know how to do substitutions on an order so it took 5 minutes to ring up the order. When I go to the window and got my food I tasted the sweet tea and sure enough, it wasn't sweet at all. I asked kindly if they could replace it with sweet tea and the manager was standing there. He said to the cashier, \"can you just give them sugar packs?\" This was horrible customer service and I was not happy with the entire experience. What should have took 3 minutes took 15 and I left unsatisfied as usual when coming to the Surprise location.   I love Canes, I am just not a fan of the Canes in Surprise. I will continue to go to their location in Glendale as they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Always well staffed with fast and friendly service  My personal opinions: Chicken tenders:  perfect Texas toast: perfect Fries: acceptable Coleslaw: good Sauce: excellent... order extra!"}
{"text":"Can't raise some hell  unless you first raise some Cane's. So this is a great spot to grub for the hard working students to grub and need some good food on a budget. I used to frequent this place upon my breaks in classes and it always hit the spot. True like others have said it can be majorly crowded, however you know that chicken tender goodness is worth it. The staff as always been really polite and have kept the dinning area clean. Even with the mad rush going on."}
{"text":"Oh happy day, finally have a Canes near my casa. Yes just as others are griping about the Drive thru is packed just like most of the other canes in the area but I like to go sit down to enjoy my chicken. The cashiers are pleasant and as far as food wise i have yet to receive any funky chicken. The clean up crew zips around the dining area constantly so it's usually well kept. My only gripe is the one fella with Red hair he makes the rounds while cleaning but no smile or personality a few nights ago he tossed the napkins i just put on the table to help go with my meal. After I was done he just reached for my tray no \"excuse me or are you done with that?\"  I realize he's trying to do his job quickly but a little table manners goes along way. That being said still like to grub here and glad that there's finally a Cane's close to me."}
{"text":"Finally! A location closer to home! My family and I no longer have to drive all the way down St. Rose Parkway for our chicken finger fix.   This is my second visit to this location and seeing as to how it's still brand new, it's been extremely busy both times. The drive-thru line always wraps around the entire building and the dining room is always packed. For the most part, the staff is friendly, but there's still a lot of improvement that could be done. While visiting today, the ketchup ran out, so my sister kindly asked one of the employees behind the counter to please refill it. He told her that he would get a manager right on it. He didn't move a finger after my sister asked him to refill it. She asked yet another employee if he could help and he said that he would refill it, she thanked him and sat down at our table to wait for it to be refilled. The whole time we were there, it didn't get refilled. I saw countless guests try to get ketchup and just walked away confused as to why nothing was coming out. We just wanted some ketchup for our fries, people! Is that too much to ask for? *facepalm*  Besides the ketchup not being refilled, our food was great as always. The chicken fingers were crispy and juicy, never dry, and the crinkle-cut fries were fresh! In case you're not a big fan of coleslaw like myself, you have the option to sub it for something else like more sauce! Cane's sauce is delicious! Delicious and addicting. I always have to get extra!"}
{"text":"Raising canes has done it again!!!! They finally opened one location in chandler !!! They are known for their chicken fingers, simple but they do it well!! The chicken strips were amazing, light coating batter, fresh juicy pieces of chicken served with crinkled cut fries and a giant Texas toast like bread. They only have one sauce called (canes sauce) but don't be fooled because it's amazing paired with these strips! They do serve a variety of soft drinks but I prefer their ice tea sooo delicious sweetened or not ..  Price wise this company does give you your money's worth! I recommended anyone come and try raising canes at least once and you will see what the amazing hype is about this restaurant!  Newly opened location is very fast quick clean and the staff is amazing!!!!! Treat everyone with respect and you surely will get it back!!"}
{"text":"The best chicken ever! Its always fresh made in less then five minuets and hits the spot. I ordered a tail gate a few times and it was super fast! Can't wait till the Decatur one opens"}
{"text":"They give you a ton of food. Omg. It's the BEST! I go here twice a month! I get the Caniac and then save half for later."}
{"text":"The solution to the ridiculously long drive-through lines is to cut out the unnecessary repetitive long sentences. I don't need a long spiel when It's my turn to order. I also don't need the order to be repeated to me in detail by three different employees before I get my food. I'm sure this is a policy inflicted upon them by corporate. But honestly I don't think it's effective as far as preventing orders from getting messed up because I stopped listening and I just want the person to take my money. If you eliminated all of this, or at least some of it, the lines would move a lot faster even though it's just a few seconds... it adds up. In addition to that when it does get crazy busy it is a total cluster fuck. Chick-fil-A on the other hand has about 10 employees outside of their building controlling traffic and you feel like you're going to a concert when you go to their drive-through. The drive-through is always very speedy and I think that although they spend a lot of money on labor, Canes should adopt that philosophy since they are also so busy.   On a positive note I was not interested in trying canes I heard it was really good I tried it and thought it was OK found myself wanting it again a couple days later now I'm fully addicted and think it's delicious"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is amazing. The best chicken fingers I have ever had.  Their prices are very reasonable and they give you a lot of food for your money. The restaurant is very clean, the people are friendly and the only problem I can see , is you are going to want to go there everyday!  Another tip, their sweet tea is very good !"}
{"text":"We love Raising Canes! We always go through the drive through at this location. Their staff is always kind and we've never had any issues with our orders."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, great prices, super friendly staff. I love the traditional breading on the chicken, and the sauce is addictive! These guys have a very simple menu (chicken tenders, crinkle fries, coleslaw, secret sauce) and they do it well. This is my go-to lunch whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This review is for this canes only. I couldn't believe how small my chicken strips were. They looks like big nuggets. Plus the fries portion was so much smaller than other canes. I'm used to getting fairly large strips and large portion of fries. Tasted good fries were ok. Iced tea was actually better than normal though"}
{"text":"Love this place. Can't put it in the same category as Chick Fil A, totally different style of chicken. New location on Bell has excellent service.  Make sure to get extra Caines sauce for your chicken!!"}
{"text":"This place is always good if you want some chicken fingers, fries, and Texas toast.  Good iced tea.  The young men and women who work here do a good job keeping the place clean and keeping the lines short.  Good prices and good grub, simple menu, great job Canes, this location is the best!"}
{"text":"Came here on a week day afternoon walked it wasn't greeted went to a cashier that looked like she hated her job name was Rikki ordered our food no thank you or nothing. Customer service is not good  chicken fingers were good though."}
{"text":"The fingers are good - very good - but the fries are just Ok... especially for a place that basically does two things! Fingers. Fries. Ok, so why the two-star? It is sooo loud in there! It's like being in a club in Scottsdale. It's not Scottsdale! Nor a club! And it was 1:22 in the PM. I realize this makes me sound like an old fuddy-duddy but I'm fairly fun and not that old :) I just don't think I wanna take a mid-day break amongst.... unsa unsa unsa unsa. I will say the staff is generally pretty helpful and positive."}
{"text":"So glad they're in Vegas.  Do the Cainiac Combo and switch out the coleslaw for Texas Toast because coleslaw is the worst thing ever and the toast is delicious (and it doesn't cost anything extra!).  For ~$12 you'll have enough food to feed two normal people or just yourself if you're really hungry. Also, the sauce that always comes with it is amazing. Even my wife likes it and she usually prefers ranch!"}
{"text":"I've traveled to multiple states and only seen these in Nevada lol It's absolutely one of my favorite fast food restaurants! Amazing chicken!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this specific location 5 stars for the huge improvement from the previous times I've gone. The last experience I ordered two Caniac combos and they gave me 4 extra chicken strips! It was a nice surprise when I opened up my box and is why I'm rating them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Spectacular chicken fingers as well as their sauce - in fact, their menu is limited to just chicken fingers  and a chicken finger sandwich. They also do tailgate packs for large parties.  As far as drive-thru versus walk-in, I'd strongly suggest just walking in. This location's drive-thru line gets jam-packed EARLY due to its popularity! You'll get faster service by parking and walking in your order.."}
{"text":"Always a big hit with this place ni mayter which location you go too. Friendly service and great chicken strips."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is decent and the bathrooms are clean.  I would give it 5 stars if they didn't charge me for an extra sauce. I know this is trivial, but it irks me a bit when I ask for another sauce and they say, \"sure, for 32 cents\"."}
{"text":"Chicken was very good, coleslaw perfect, toast okay and fries so-so. Super busy place! It's hot in AZ, turn up the AC please =)."}
{"text":"Is it bad to say we eat here about once a week? Lol. Quick, easy menu, delicious. Some days it is not as good as others, to be expected from a fast food chicken chain. I love the dippng sauce and make sure you get a Caniac card because they give you a free combo for signing up."}
{"text":"The parking lot was fairly clean abd maintained landscaping.  The bathroom and dining room we're clean and the decor was standard Cane's cheerful bright & welcoming.  I love that they still greet everyone upon entry.   Our order came out quickly.  The chicken was piping hot but the fries not so much.  I went to ask for their complimentary honey mustard because Cane sauce is good but really not that big of a deal IMO.  While at the counter I mention to the manager that my fries were not that hot.  She said ok but never offered me a replacement.  I was starving so I just walked away.   My opinion on the chicken.  It is very delicious, juicy and consistent in preparation.  I am not a huge fan of chicken fingers so the fact that we drove out of our way means there are worth the drive.  This location has faulty locking mechanisms on The bathroom stalls make for awkward moments.  I accidentally walked in on someone and the other stall would not lock at all.  Would I return, yes.  Hope my fries are hot.  lol"}
{"text":"The problem with major fast food chains expanding is that one or more things tend to not be up to par. Things like service, food quality, and overall employee morale.  For this location my observation was that service is really slow. Yes, I know that they have only been open for 1 month but dont they have all sorts of training beforehand not to mention other employees coming over from other locations?  Anyways the food here is what will bring you back 10 times out of 10. The food is simple. Hand breaded chicken strips deep fried to perfection that come with Texas toast, cole slaw, fries, and a drink when you make it a combo. Just pick your combo (The Box Combo is the most popular one) and enjoy!  Some pointers. If you dont like the cole slaw, you can substitute it with extra bread. Speaking of the bread, they normally butter and toast only one side. But you can request to have both sides done. Each combo comes with only one Cane's sauce but of course you can order more for 31 cents each. They have coke products. Their tea comes in sweet and unsweet. The lemonade is very good.  Lastly, make sure to sign up for the Canes Card. This gives you access to awesome promotions like buy one box combo get one free. This usually applies to both Mother's and Father's day. There are also other promos during the year as well. It's free to sign up so dont pass it up!  In closing, im hoping the service improves over time and I will verify with my next visit in the next couple months or so. If it has improved I will update accordingly.  Yelp 2015 Review #23 521 overall"}
{"text":"They do one thing and they do it better than everyone else. The chicken is always great. Fresh lemonade and tea are a nice plus."}
{"text":"The best chicken!!! Love their sauce and toast, too! So glad they built one near my home I used to drive to the one on peoria and the I-17"}
{"text":"Other than the slightly over priced menu, Raising Cains truly impressed me! They are a different type of fast-food restaurant and hopefully remain as item specific as the seem to be currently - they found one thing (fried boneless chicken strips, coleslaw, and crinkle cut French fries) which they do perfectly and stuck with just that. The one complaint I do have probably reflects more upon the average employee's salary than anything else, but the \"teeny bopper\" staff bring the overall dining experience down a few notches and it is somewhat disappointing that an establishment which has apparently cornered the illustrious chicken finger market, doesn't pay a high enough wage which would attract qualified adults to work in the created atmosphere that is Raising Cain's Chicken."}
{"text":"Love their food- it's always hot and fresh when your order comes out. The only downside is that the dining room is small, always packed and the music tends to be a little on the loud side. Haven't had a bad meal yet!"}
{"text":"The first and last time I went to Cane's, I was shocked at how the cashiers conducted themselves. I saw these high schooler cashiers chasing and wacking each other with towels. I saw all of the front people standing around aimlessly instead of cleaning the main floor or checking on customers. The food was not good. The chicken tenders are breast meat and tender but I didn't care for this amazing sauce that they are renowned for. My child spilled a drink and their attempt to clean up was piss poor and lazy. They literally threw paper towels on it and swished it around. I had to move because the guy was just sloshing it around all over the place. I would have rather mopped and cleaned it up properly myself. If they don't properly clean surfaces or floors, I'd be concerned about how they handle the food that I am eating. I did not see one team member that appeared over 21; that is alarming. When you invest hundreds of thousands into a franchise, you can't rely on teenagers that have minimal work ethic to float your business."}
{"text":"Always tasty, always super fresh.  This location seems to be busy all the time, but they still get your food out in less than five minutes.  The cashiers are usually very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Nice to have a place dedicated to my favorite classic dish.  Great deal for the amount of food received.  Love their signature sauce. I would say the chicken fingers were tasty, but nothing new compared to other sit down restaurants' chicken fingers at about the same price.  Would love a more memorable signature seasoning on them!  Friendly staff, place was clean, and very packed at lunch."}
{"text":"I love Raising Canes but Alicia forgot about our order! Everyone else was getting their food and LUCKILY my fiancé decided to go up and ask. She didn't  give the cooks our order. We waited 20 minutes. One of the food servers compensated with a lemonade so I give them a 3 star."}
{"text":"Gotta love the chicken. Here with that special sauce. Great place to have a meal when. You and your gf can't decide on what to eat, I always use this place as a backup. Not 5 stars because it bugs me that the amazing tea is never cold. You have to wait for the ice to do it's work for the tea to become cold. But overall a great place to eat"}
{"text":"This place is really good!!  The chicken is good and moist! The fries are ok and the Cole slaw is ok. But the chicken is really good!! So is the sauce!!! Yumm"}
{"text":"Canes Chicken has always been one of my go to fast food places if I'm in a hurry. The quality of the food is amazing for the price you pay. This was my first time visiting this store, I usually go to the the one in Tempe or Mesa and it's extremely clean, the friendliness of the staff is fantastic! Eric the manager of this location is super friendly and very helpful if you have any questions regarding the menu or anything else he took great care of me and my girlfriend! I highly recommend going here if you've never been!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in I thought this was just another fast food chicken place. It is not! The chicken is fresh, the slaw is AMAZING, and the customer service is amazing. The friendly manner of the employees and Manager John are just perfect and we will be back!"}
{"text":"When you come here all they have is chicken strips and chicken strips in a sandwich. The combo is good chicken strips are always hot. They give you a dipping sauce that's is really good. Does not taste like any other sauces. The garlic bread is killer. Big fan of the tea. My kids love going to this place. It's nice you don't get overwhelmed  on what to order."}
{"text":"So I been to other canes locations but this is my first time here. Probably won't be back anytime soon. The place was very busy. We got our food quick. Usually the chicken and fries are super hot which means super fresh. Chicken was like warm with cold fries. I love Cane's tea but this tea looked like they used bathroom water to make it."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try Raising Cane's for the first time and I didn't come away disappointed.   Upon entering the restaurant,  I was welcomed by the friendly staff. Great first impression!  I'm a fan of chicken fingers/strips and I'd heard good things about Raising Cane's so I ordered the three piece chicken finger combo that cane with crinkle cut fries, Texas toast and a 20oz drink. I chose the ice cold lemonade for $6.49 + tax.  A friendly server brought my meal to my table and I was impressed with the breast meat chicken fingers/strips as they were tender and juicy with a not too thick crunchy coating. There was also a generous portion of crinkle cut fries that tasted pretty good overall, though I prefer larger crinkle cut fries, these were smaller fries. Finally, a large slice of nicely grilled Texas Toast topped of my meal that also included a nice cold lemonade that tasted great.   I also enjoyed the smokey & peppery dipping sauce that I enjoyed with my chicken & fries. A nice touch.  Upon leaving, I was thanked by the staff for visiting their restaurant.  Their greeting and farewell seemed genuine and not forced. Well done you guys!  My first visit to Raising Cane's was enjoyable and I plan on returning.   Hook 'em!"}
{"text":"Salty every time! Up beat inside. Clean. You have to yell at your company because the music is too loud. I don't know what the hype is about."}
{"text":"Been a regular to this Canes for a while now.  The employees are very nice and respectful.  The food comes out very quickly.  I have not waited longer than 5 minutes to get my food.  I believe there sweet tea alone needs to have its own Yelp review."}
{"text":"First time here and I will definitely be back. I pass by here multiple times a day and today I decided to stop in with my family. IT'S GREAT! Great food, great service, great atmosphere and great prices. Nice clean place. We paid. $26 for a family of four. We usually spend 30 if we go to McDonald's and the food and service is much better here. Service was fast and the food was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"They mixed up the orders a little and I ended up paying for a box combo when I got a 3 piece combo. I emailed and within hours somebody called me and apologized! It was an honest mistake, but she ended up sending me a gift card for a free box combo! Thanks Lanea! Awesome response time! I've emailed several other companies and never received a response so I was pleasantly surprised to get a response so quickly. My favorite chicken place, hands down. And for all you guys who degrade the workers, why don't you hop in and try, it's not as easy as it looks."}
{"text":"The food speaks for itself. Perfectly breaded and fried chicken, insanely good crinkle fries, toasted Texas bread that's out of this world and last, but definitely not least, the Cane's sauce. So, so, so freaking good!!!  (I purposely left out the cole slaw cause I'm not a fan of slaw in general).   Love the fact that you can trade out your slaw for extra fries, an extra sauce OR an extra piece of toast. Go ahead and ask them to butter and toast the bread on both sides-extra buttery and yummy. On the drink side of things, they offer a nice variety of soda as well as lemonade and southern sweet tea that's on point.   The ambiance at the restaurant is great-they pay nice homage to the city of Las Vegas and UNLV. I only gave this particular location 4 stars because it seems that every time we go inside, it's a challenge to find a clean table.   Overall, you can't go wrong with Cane's. Dinner for 2 is normally right around $20 and you'd be hard pressed to find a meal this good for that cheap anywhere else."}
{"text":"Very frustrating drive thru.  The order taker kept interrupting me, trying to tell me the total, while I was trying to tell her the order.  I, finally, had to ask her to stop, so that I could tell her the full order.  If it was my order they would have lost about half of the revenue out of sheer frustration with her rudeness."}
{"text":"It's a magical place with magical chicken fingers with magical sauce, and the best customer service that you can receive. Their general manager John, does a great job in leading by example. The food tastes fresh, and the service is quick!"}
{"text":"I had a frustrating experience at Canes the other day.  Nothing terrible or in regards to the quality of their food. Just a misunderstanding.  After mentioning my experience, I was contacted by the business owner and I also received a call from Jesse (can't recall his position in the company) and he was very concerned with the issue i had experienced and went above and beyond to make take care of us. I love Canes and have never experienced any issues with them before. Their food is top notch and always fresh and after receiving the phone call from Jesse I am confident that they always take care of their customers. I stopped by again today and the manager Joe took great care of us.  I'm a proud and loyal customer and will remain that way. Thanks again to Jesse and Joe."}
{"text":"You're greeted as you arrive and the food is brought to your table when it's ready. This place is always clean, there's usually always someone wiping the tables so you'll sit in a clean area. The food is consistent and so is the flow of foot traffic.   Their  original location is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and now have over 350+ locations. The logo is a dog, a yellow lab. Initially I was confused by the logo because it didn't give me an indication of what type of food they serve. You'll realize they're the only chicken-finger focused restaurant!  Give me them chicken-fingers...you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great drive thru, fast fried chicken. Sweet tea is so good.  Made proper and reminds me of home in Texas. Agree with others' toast comments and the fries are pretty good too. Chicken strips are awesome. My daughter likes them above popeyes fried chicken which I thought was crazy talk until trying them myself. Really really good and now is my choice whenever we've been since. Worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Place was clean and very friendly staff  the chicken didn't stand out . Wasn't offered any choice of sauces but would come back again"}
{"text":"All I have been hearing is how great this place is, best chicken fingers in town. Well after hearing all of the hype, Wife and I decided to try this franchise out.  NO BIG DEAL!! Chicken was OK, not much flavor. Thinking they are counting on you trying their Cane Sauce for the flavor? Speaking of sauce, they have ketchup, honey mustard, and cane sauce. Now their Cane Sauce is like a thousand island with a little kick. They do not offer is mustard, and BBQ Sauce? Nothing here really stood out for me, it really wasn't that big of a deal. I would rather go to Chick-fil-a anytime! I do need to mentioned that their service was really good, the gals were very courteous, always making sure everything was fine! Overall, I am glad we at least tried it, not saying I wouldn't come here again. But there is better chicken out there."}
{"text":"This is the best chicken fingers place ever. It is fresh and moist chicken. The staff automatically recognized us when we entered and the staff was extremely friendly. It was a very clean and inviting. Definitely would return. Go canes"}
{"text":"It's a popular establishment like In & Out so yes expect there to be a line of cars! All that means is they obviously serve delicious chicken! And the waits not even that long . **Highly Recommended if you want actual chicken  tenders. ** With delicious Texas toast"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Let me tell u why. The chicken strips are to die for.  They are not over battered and the fries are crinkly and now my favorite fries.  I get the caniac combo which feeds two people easily.  It is always packed on the one on stapley and hard to find a parking.  The only thing I would complain about is the sauce that comes with the chicken they charge extra if you want extra sauce.  I think this should be free and you should have as much as you want....."}
{"text":"Of course the drive thru is long, it's good food and it's a new business! Love it. Headed there now actually. Line or not."}
{"text":"I've been craving fried chicken for a while and decided to try Raising Cane's again because the last time I had it, it wasn't very good... and I don't remember why.   I ordered the 3 finger combo which came with their sauce, 3 chicken tenders, texas toast, fries and a regular drink for about $7.The price is decent, I think you're paying for the quality of the chicken though. At Popeyes you can get 5 pcs of chicken, 2 biscuits and 2 regular sides for almost the same price (with coupon). Although the drive through line was long, I got my food SUPER fast... like McDonalds fast!! I found that weird but I guess it doesn't take long to toss everything together.   I had to reheat everything up when I got back home in the toaster oven since it was a 20 minute drive home. The chicken tenders were slightly crispy on the outside but juicy and soft on the inside. I wonder how they get it to be so juicy. The fries were ok, nothing special. The texas toast was big, buttery and soft. To be honest I think I enjoyed it more than the chicken. Their sauce is kind of weird, I'm not sure what they put in it but it was a bit sour to me. I ended up dipping everything in ketchup.   They're doing some promotion right now (ends 3/31/16) similar to mcdonalds where they put stickers on their cups and you peel it, go online and enter the code to see if you've won anything. Apparently 1 in 3 is a winner. I didn't win anything."}
{"text":"Solid chicken strips, but not much else. Unlike many, I'm actually not a huge fan of their toast or their fries - they always seem to get soggy by the time I get them home. But that's ok - because their chicken strips, along with their delicious special sauce, is reason enough to stop in. The strips have just the right amount of breading, are fried to hot perfection, and are consistently tender and juicy. They have a number of meal deals, but we usually opt for a tailgater pack - 25 strips with sauce, no fries, no bread. Always a hit for snacking during football games or for parties.  The Peoria location is easy to get to across from Arrowhead Mall on Bell Road, and is a lot closer for us than the other location by Metro Center.  It may not be the super fast, but it is worth the wait and the service is always friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying I am NOT a big chicken fan at all. However, my boyfriend loves chicken and made me come and try this place. At first I wasn't so sure about how I felt about the chicken. Now that I'm back for my 3rd time should say alot about it. The chicken is crispy and delicious and their signature sauce give it that little kick of flavor it needs! Ahhh and let me say I drink sweet tea more then anyone on earth and their tea is PERFECT not too sweet and not too plain just right! They have combos for how hungry you are. I always get the Box and that is 4 chicken fingers and a toast. My boyfriend gets the Caniac which is 6 fingers. UHH and their toast is amazing is soft and crispy on the outside. It's like a seed bun but omg. This is to die for. YOU NEED TO TRY THIS."}
{"text":"Freshly cooked food every time. Reasonable pricing and they offer military discount. I love their lemonade and toast. They use real chicken."}
{"text":"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this locations food or service. The 4 stars are because the drive through location is horrible! Next door there's a tire shop and when ever their receiving a shipment it's completely blocked off. A few times they've had cars they were working on blocking it as well. Yes, you can to go around the other side but if there's a line your sticking out in a very busy area. This is a hectic location since it's right next to the mall."}
{"text":"Chicken Fingers Don't Get Any Better Then This.    If you are a Chicken Finger  lover, like my nephew I encourage you to give Raising Canes a try. These Fried Chicken Fingers take a back seat to no one. Raising Canes boneless Chicken Strips and dipping sauce are hard to beat.   Raising Canes never-frozen chicken tenderloins are fryed-to-order and accompanied by the best dipping sauce known to man.  The meat stays juicy, none of the dryness problems that plague lesser variations of fried chicken strips. The Chicken Strip combo box is served with crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, and a side of coleslaw.  You have to try the fresh squeezed lemonade, it's the best.   Raising Canes has quick service and friendly staff, so if your in the mood for chicken fingers, head on over."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time today, because my favorite spot is closed on Sundays. I've heard that the strips were amazing, so I was eager to give it a try. An employee opened the door for me as I entered, and the cashier was very professional and friendly as well. Very good first impression.  I ordered the six tender combo to split with my  little, and grabbed a sweet tea. My wait was reasonable and everything was in the box.  So everything smelled delicious. However, the taste was missing. There was no seasoning on chicken , fries or cole slaw. My kid ,loved the toast. There was Cane's sauce however, tasted a lot like tartar sauce . I have honestly had better strips from Wal-Mart and Albertsons (no exaggeration). Not only were the strips lacking flavor, they were inconsistent in size.   Maybe I was expecting too much ? I'm not sure but the hype did not measure up to the actual experience for me."}
{"text":"As usual, the drive thru was powerfully slow! After I inched my way to the pick up window and drove away, my kid noticed the Texas toast was missing from his order. If you're going to make us wait forever in the drive thru, the least you can do is get the order right! If it weren't for my kid, I would NEVER waste my time at this place!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Cali so this was my first time. I had to see what all the hype was about. The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. It was expensive for just chicken and fries. The chicken tenders were okay. The sauce is what made them better. The fries and the bread were also good. I would return."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is the In N Out Burger of Chicken Fingers.   They only sell chicken fingers and fries. I like the simple menu.  The food is consistent and always served fresh.   The staff are always friendly. I do find they sometimes get distracted among themselves but that's because most of them are High School kids.    I omit the coleslaw and toast for extra fries instead.  Kids crave this place. The drive thru is always packed.  While not the healthiest choice it's a nice treat every now and then."}
{"text":"RC will be getting 4**** based on its ability to remain consistent throughout the years! The chicken is always moist, fresh from the fryer, and crispy! The bread is still buttery, soft, chewy, and addicting. The special sauce is still special and last the fries are always fresh. I will give u a few tips though if you are looking to take your canes addiction to the next level.  If your taking the food to go, pop a hole in the box to help the steam escape, making for less soggy fries. Also, get a Cane's card its worth it!! You get b1g1 offers loaded to your card almost every other month and on special occasions like birthdays and holidays saving you a lot of money!   If you like you chicken quick, hot, and fresh try Cane's they won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"What I payed for and what I actually got back. Don't double check orders. I payed for two meals and when I came home I looked to see that the check numbers weren't the same and I didn't get all my food. Staff just seems very young."}
{"text":"Love this place great consistent food and fast service but shame for charging for mustard sauce.  I will still pay for it and like the regular sauce.  Sweet tea is great too.  Good comfort food."}
{"text":"BEST service you can ask for!  This location is nice but gets really packed during dinner.  Food is great and customer service is better!!!!"}
{"text":"awesome service. Came 10 minutes before close (I suck, I know) and in the drive thru there was a line of at least 12 vehicles. Staff was fast & friendly. Not bothered the slightest by the late rush. Food was on point and fresh. Mad props to the staff working that night."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service I waited 30 minutes for chicken: which is beyond ridiculous on my way home from work this is fast food suppose to be a quick stop unbelievable I will not be back again. You guys lost a customer. Manager wouldn't even turn his back to apologies or anything. very disappointed I get that it's a new location some waited 45 minutes, me never again"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to raising canes, but my husband and I random craving for it so we went. Not only did we have amazing service but the food was hot and delicious!!! They saw we had two of our dogs with us and gave us dog treats for them!!! Their food is so good my 5 year old picky only wanting chicken nuggets son ate the food (chicken strips) and wanted more!!! Our new favorite place to eat!!!!! Can't wait for pay day!!!"}
{"text":"No clue why they have bad reviews and I don't got time to read that kind of negativity. It's Canes, kids!   I have been watching this location being built like I use to wait for my parents to wake up on Christmas so I can open my presents. It's open now! Woot, woot.  Good stuff here. Real simple. Chicken fingers here. Nothing else. You can get a meal or order them ala carte. Or level up like I do and get the chicken finger sandwich. You can get it on a delicious bun or on the garlic toast. I prefer the bun because I like big buns and I cannot lie. I'm also a huge fan of the crinkle cut fries they serve here. Two other strong points are the special sauce and the sweet tea. Oh yeah, I can't forget the crushed ice. People go crazy for that shit.  See this place is dope! For a fast food place that's consistently doing me right I can't help, but give it props."}
{"text":"Love the food here! The staff is always nice and polite. The food always comes out fast and fresh. Only bad thing is there's always a line, not their fault."}
{"text":"Overrated for sure. Have none of the people that love this place ever been to Slim Chickens or Chick-fil-A?! Their chicken was greasy, the Texas toast was soggy and the fries were soggy too.  Not sure how this place has such a huge following, maybe we went on an off day but I really don't see how the food would taste much better. There are some places that know how to do chicken right, Raising Canes isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Never again will I eat here they are so unsanitary and legit  threw away my food after I saw this"}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's toast. I went there, got two pieces of toast, and a chicken strip. I forgot to ask for the bread to be BOB, but when I got it, it was cold. Marian was so nice, she kept a copy of my receipt and told me to come back for a free box or three finger combo. I came back, told a different manager who I was, he never got my receipt or anything. I got a free kids meal, but he added a piece of toast, so I only missed out on one or two chicken strips I thought I would get. I asked my bread to be BOB, and expected it to be right. My bread was mostly warm, it felt like it had been sitting in the window, and it most definitely was NOT BOB. I am done coming to this Canes because clearly their employees can't figure out how to keep food fresh. I used work in take out in my restaurant, and I know it's not difficult. I'll go to any other canes."}
{"text":"Fast food with out the grease. Chicken is very good, and facility just seems a lot nicer and cleaner then most fast food restaurants"}
{"text":"Canes has the best chicken fingers, bar none! They are always so hot, juicy, and delicious. The sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"Second time I have subbed the coleslaw for extra fries and didn't really see the difference in my portion of fries. They are starting to get skimpy with their food. I guess I'm going to have to start checking my food at the drive thru before I leave so I don't get cheated out of my money."}
{"text":"This is a follow up from my last review that was at the beginning of January. Went here today 1-31-18 around 12pm. This time around I have to say that EVERYTHING was perfect!! Fry's, Fingers, bread, slaw. Thanks again, and see ya soon."}
{"text":"Love cane's ! Great chicken tenders  and lemonade but this location needs improvement.  Needs more attention from staff cleaning... There's something wrong with their water/ ice ... I have given it a try several times hoping problem has been fixed even letting them know once over the phone to check lemonade or ice as It didn't taste right.... but no... still tastes horrible! That's why I'm giving a 3 star..."}
{"text":"Wow ia that drive thru packed after 5 p.m.!  It was way faster for me to just get off of my car and order inside. I got my order extremely fast. I even got out sooner than some of the cars that were at the the drive thru.    It was my husnand and my first time trying out this restaurant. We wanted to try it after my brother raved of it being the best. I got the 6 piece chicken fingers, it comes with: fries, Cole slaw, a piece of toast,  and cane sauce.  I thought it was a little in the pricey side. I didn't really enjoy the chicken with their sauce. I ate mine with the Louisiana hot sauce they have at the restaurant. If my husband or I are ever in the mood for \"chicken fingers\" we'll just stick to KFC not worth the drive from Buckeye."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times since it opened, and the customer service here is amazing! Thank you! (Food is always consistently good, too)."}
{"text":"Every time I've been in here the staff and manager have been awesome! One of the soda syrups was out and after I let the manager know he had it swapped out in about a minute. They are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Thanks for providing the best chicken ever! Way better than kfc and better than pdq. Only want more variety in sauce but other than that, get butter both sides and sub your Cole slaw for more toast!"}
{"text":"I kid you not, every time I come here, these kids cut me off while I order. Then, once I get to the window, they shove food into my face. This location is awful in customer service and needs to be retrained. Raising canes, I tell you, if you did not have delicious food, you be shut down for your workers being ignorant. Also, my order is never right. I challenge the manager to drive up at night to the window and experience what everyone experiences. I'm sure this is a franchise and could care less because they are profitable. Also whoever Valeria, needs to be fired. She is a flat out bitch!"}
{"text":"Made my order and the friendly Cane'nette, gave me a quick once over and asked about the military, then proceeded to tap her register including (subtracting) the military discount. She then advised me to mention it on all future visits. That's bonus points right there.   Cane's has one of the simplest menus going but what's on the menu is what everyone's here for. Light batter fried chicken tenders and delicious thin crinkled fries. If that's not your thing, don't bother.  Most (disclaimer No.1) people who like fried chicken strips, really really like Cane's and then there is everybody else.  When you order there is going to be a wait because they prepare your food at that time. Nine times out of ten (disclaimer No.2) it's presented to you hot so be careful for the sake of your mouth.   Served with a thick piece of Texas toast - light crunch on the outside and soft in the middle. Order the 4 piece strips and you get coleslaw to boot.   Plenty of seating inside and a drive-thru for the grab and go crowd. Note for the car clans, there's going to be a wait in line because just like inside, it's made when you order.  Turn on your radio and relax."}
{"text":"... Its still just breaded chicken tenders.  Better than frozen tenders but still tenders.  Entire basket is tan ... Tenders, Fries, buttered toasted bread.  All tan.  Felt kinda like I just ate a tenders basket meal at Disney when I was done."}
{"text":"What can I say but it's delicious. Always crispy and hot. The kids are super friendly and helpful. It's kept clean. The Texas toast itself is worth the trip. We usually get extra."}
{"text":"I have to admit: the food is really good, but sometimes it just isn't worth the wait. The drive thru is always jam packed, and even when you go inside (as I learned today), you should plan on waiting. It's really disappointing that they haven't figured out how to prepare all 5 items on their menu in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I got a gift card for this place from one of my customers and a lot of my friends rave about this place it was truly delicious my family really enjoyed it the tea was hands down the best tea I have had in a long time !! I would of given it 5 stars but when we got to the register we looked a bit confused B.c we have never been there before we told the lady at the front we were new she just said ok like seriously your not even going to give us the run down or nothing there was no one behind us so she could of taken the time to explain to us a little bit that's just rude in my opinion. You want your new customers to be filled in hopefully next time we get someone better than her. Other than that the food was great !!!"}
{"text":"I am a Caniac myself. So before I get started, I just hope this all gets resolved. I go to this location probably every week. My dog Buddy loves to come for the ride and his milk bone as well. The food I get is good, about 60% of the time it is like warm if not on the colder side. I am a sweet tea addict and let me just say, that night crew, they pay no attention to the little things. The sweet tea is basically just brown water. And when they serve it, there's hardly any ice. I noticed that when I go during the day, my experience is much better. At night, I guess the high school kids just wanna play around. This is still a business and I like to view Canes as a higher end fast food spot. Again, I LOVE Canes so this isn't trolling. The next closest one to my house is 12 miles away. This one is less than a mile. So please management, get the team together and make this right. I'd hate to have to drive out of my way based on an easy fix. Thanks,"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Raising Cane's and it will be my last. The food arrived quickly. Everything looked under cooked and greasy. I did try eating some of it and now I am regretting it. I feel incredibly AWFUL and cheated out of dinner. I'm going home to throw up. I will stick to Chick-fil-A. Sorry Cane's your food is disgusting."}
{"text":"Place is just bad. So many people told me this place has the best chicken. It really was just awful."}
{"text":"This location is new and very very popular, the drive thru line is insane and I would probably not eat here until the novelty of a new place wears off. The food is good and no real complaints, but with a few slight flaws and one big one. First the sauce they offer is good, but a few other choices could help with variety in flavors. I like to dip the french fries in the sauce too so for me it's not just for the chicken. I would also like some thicker fries, but no big deal. I don't understand why they give you a big piece of toast, but again no complaints about it. I read that others here have a complaint about the sodas tasting like water and although I didn't have a soda, I did have the sweet tea and it has a very strange bad tap water taste to it. The tea dispenser is placed with one sweet tea, a unsweetened tea and another sweet tea. I tried the one on the right and dumped it out because it tasted off, like a metal taste to it, the one on the far left was better, but still not good. McDonalds has a better sweet tea than this. I hope they figure this out, maybe the pipes for the water supply is not correct? Hey management, look into this. I also noticed some cones in the parking lot to guide drive thru customers in the right direction, but there might be some kind of design flaw because I notice cars having to make a U-turn to head the right way in. Overall a good place for chicken, although nothing super special and right now very crowded as Stephanie/215 is turning into junk food central. LOL"}
{"text":"The chicken is really good and very moist.  My favorite is the chicken sandwich.  The bun is very soft and has a generous amount of chicken.  Prices are excellent as well.  Altogether. Raising Canes is a great addition to Surprise!"}
{"text":"Glad this place opened!  Before I used to have to drive to Peoria Ave.  My review for that location applies here...   Delicious chicken fingers and sauce!!!  I'm a transplant from the Southeast and had really been missing the chicken finger joints like Zaxby's and Guthrie's in Florida and Georgia with their perfectly cooked chicken fingers, special sauce, crinkle fries, and texas toast.  Raising Cane's serves it up just like those joints.  Fresh, hot, and delicious.  If you don't like chicken fingers, this place is not for you.  It's all they do.  Their tiny menu consists of box combos with either 3, 4, or 6 fingers, or a 3-finger sandwich, along with fries, texas toast, and Cane's sauce.  You get coleslaw with the 4 and 6 finger boxes. They have no other dipping sauces, just Cane's sauce, a peppery mayo-based sauce.  Oh so delicious!  And they have great sweet iced tea!  Always a plus in my book.  4 stars!  Note: I do not like the set up of the drive-through at Bell Rd location as it has a very awkward exit on to a busy section of the shopping plaza."}
{"text":"Cane's has amazing chicken tenders and a nice simple menu.  The chicken tenders are all made to order and nothing sits under heat lamps.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with our children.  I expect this location will be busy so plan your visit accordingly!"}
{"text":"I really like Raising Cane's and have had it a few times now. This visit while good overall with pleasant staff, reasonably quick service, and great food was just slightly less than others in that a couple of my fingers were a touch rubbery. I think they may not quite have been cooked enough though there was absolutely no pink showing. Not enough to keep me away, just enough to cost a star."}
{"text":"These are absolutely delicious chicken fingers that can serve as a substitute for chicken pieces at at fried chicken place. The fries are also great as is the Texas toast. Service is always with a smile and it's apparent that customer satisfaction is very important to management. This particular location is rather new and I believe may be suffering from some growing pains as wait time is a little longer than expected. Given that the food is cooked to order and the food IS actually very good, waiting a few minutes longer is not a bad thing and certainly something that is likely to improve when they get into their groove.  Oh, and to the manager \"Go Leafs Go!\" (he's a Habs fan... ugh!) :)"}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Fingers, Cain Sauce and the Texas Toast!"}
{"text":"Arrived here just 15 minutes before they closed. Still greeted with a friendly and upbeat employee. Food came out at a timely manner."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday @11am. Nobody was in line and I still had an awful experience. I ordered caniac combo and paid $10.20 plus tax!! The whole meal was cold. And to make matters worse I was given 5 chicken fingers instead  of 6. I couldn't even take down my old food cuz the sweet  tea/Lemonade was ultra sweet. It was like trying to swallow a bag of sugar. I will never return to this establishment. Steer clear from this place."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Las Vegas & Henderson, we always make sure we go to Raising Canes at least once!   This is our 2nd time eating Raising Canes and this is our first time at this location. Food is always tastes fresh and hot! Their food and lemonade is delicious! Staff were friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, and man is their staff friendly!! They just made me so happy and really surprised on how polite and professional every one of the associates were! Plus they even asked to verify my debit card at the drive thru! A+ Love it!! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Connor Brague, best decision Cane's has made since double butter toast. Amazing employee."}
{"text":"I'm sad to give just 2 stars on my first visit. I was hopeful for this new place. I went through the drive thru. What's up with the mic system? It was so hard to hear the employee.  And who puts the first window just a few feet from the place to order? No wonder lines here get long!   I ordered the Caniac to share with my son. I paid for the Caniac. I got home and saw they did not give me the Caniac. Packed my son back up in the car and drove back with now cold, untouched food. I chose to go inside to tell them about the order mix-up. I wasn't mad. They are new and it happens. Walking in we passed many employees out front on a break cussing and yelling. Inside employees were messing around.   I gave my food back and explained issue. The cashier took it and told cook they messed up on the order. Another random guy (maybe an employee who was off) yelled \"Yea fix it!\". The manager was called and she was confused because she didn't understand why she was needed. I never called her over.  She just said \"do we owe you money? \" I got my food back. The container felt warm and I opened it to check it over.   All is well so back to the car to load in my kid. Cold food 10 minutes later at home. The cook just added some chicken to the box of food I returned.   Not impressed and will not return. The chicken and sauce lacked flavor. The staff was mediocre at best. Let's hope this place turns around quickly!  Chick-fil-a for life now!"}
{"text":"Great Food and Atmosphere;  Would give 5 starts but the last 4 out of five times we went to the drive through window we were shorted food, Drink, Chicken Fingers and even the bread once."}
{"text":"Love going here to starfish my chicken tender cravings! Why 3 Stars instead of 4? That's because the quality is hit or miss lol. Y'all know how much I dislike soggy fries and chicken tenders right? Fortunately, this place has been getting their stuff crispy for the most part. I'm still trying to figure out if there's an optimal time to go lol.  I'd recommend getting the canica combo which comes with 4 chicken tenders, a slice of buttered bread, coleslaw, and one serving of their special sauce. If you hate coleslaw with a passion as much as I do, then you can opt for extra (soggy?) fries, sauce, or bread. Their ice tea is also a hit or miss. Sometimes it can be the most refreshing drink ever or it can be like a sugar bomb (even when mixing the unsweetened tea with the sweetened tea).   Overall I'd recommend for you guys to check this place out if you haven't been here yet! You can also join their loyalty program if you see yourself being a frequent customer like I am!"}
{"text":"Best chicken I have ever had! They also give you small packets of lousiana hot sauce to go with your chicken....yum! The French fries are exceptional!!!"}
{"text":"You should really come her if you love waiting in line for mediocre chicken. Drive thru line is always super long and going inside is not any better"}
{"text":"As a black man I can safely say Raising Cane's isn't by us but it's definitely for us as a tax-paying citizen I definitely think Raising Cane's is for the urban community... I definitely think the bread is overrated but I also hated the movie Titanic so what shoot the fade..."}
{"text":"Wondered what all the hype was about. First time at a Raising Canes. It was a big disappointment. The chicken tenders were a LOT better at KFC & Culver's and cheaper. If you don't like their SPECIAL DIPPING SAUCE, they make you BUY a 1oz container of honey mustard, NO RANCH sauce!!!  KFC's coleslaw beats Canes by a mile. The employes were having a good time yelling and screaming in the kitchen. NOT very business like. I guess by now you have guessed I won't be back."}
{"text":"Soda taste like tap water. Food is alright. It was crazy busy but it was expected being week of opening. Other locations I visit near my work, their sofa taste just fine. Idk if they skipped on the filter to open faster or not. Surprised they don't have the new Coke machines with flavors."}
{"text":"Best place to eat chicken fingers... Great services food is away fresh I recommend to dine there after first visit You will returned for more great fresh food"}
{"text":"The staff here is so nice and very understanding to every request. The chicken is so juicy and the fries are amazing. The secret sauce is definitely one of my favorites. Restaurant is always clean. One of my favorite locations."}
{"text":"canes sauce is what this place is all about! there chicken all ways comes out hot and fresh. there was one better chicken place called rock n roll chicken fingers in tempe but there gone now, so this is the best chicken fingers in the valley right now for sure."}
{"text":"Just ate at Cane's.   Only 2 registers to serve customers. Basically all they serve is chicken strips. They only have 2 sauces. One is honey mustard and the other is their \"secret sauce\". The secret is it has zero taste!  The chicken is cooked well and is decent. Although not a lot of flavor or anything that stands out. No Cajun seasoning or different styles. The fries are the crinkle cut frozen type.  Nothing stands out about Cane's. Just a bland chicken strip place with minimal condiments."}
{"text":"Love their chicken and sauce and the tea is the best. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Just want to say thank you to Sabrina, I had an aweful experience at another location and accidentally called this one. I was a little upset so I'm sure I was coming off rude. She was still very nice and very helpful even after finding out I wasn't at her store. Great service, thank you."}
{"text":"Was excited to see Cane's open on my side of town. Since it's new it is still very busy. The line for the drive thru wraps all the way around the building. This was the case when I attempted to go for lunch and again at dinner time. Staff is still new and working through the opening jitters but they were very friendly and attentive. Food was as good at any other location and I will be a frequent customer here."}
{"text":"First timer. Wasn't all that impressed by it but I did like that they gave my dog a treat when I went through the drive through so just for that I'll give them 3 stars vs 2 stars. They have their own sauce they give you which I didn't really care for and the meat wasn't anything special as people hype it up to be."}
{"text":"Nothing sets Cane's chicken apart from other restaurant chicken fingers.  Was hoping there would be a selection of sauces that complimented the chicken tenders.  Turns out the only \"free\" sauce tastes like whipped up thousand island dressing with Worcestershire.  The other sauce options that come at an additional cost is honey-mustard, which I would guess tastes like half chewed wriggly gum peeled from the bottom of a shoe and ketchup with hot sauce mixed together.  Way to go Cane's you win over McDonalds chicken nuggets and 3 to 12 year olds are rejoicing throughout the southwest!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place but my experience here wasn't mind blowing. I got the \"3 finger combo\". The chicken was bland, not crispy and it was cold. The fries were soggy. The sauce was bland and Sonic's Texas toast had more flavor than their thick, soggy, half seasame seed hot dog bun that they call, \"toast\". None of it was worth the $6.59 I spent or the calories I ingested."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Cane's that disappoints! Spectacular chicken strips, yummy piece of toast, and DELICIOUS Cane's sauce. Always friendly service and such a great value! Can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"I am going to give Raising Canes 3 stars for 2 reasons. The first is that they use real chicken and their sauce. Everything else was just ok. The fries were not very hot. The Cole slaw was ok. The bread was bread. This may be too picky but I didn't like that they didn't have lemonade as a choice in the fountain. It was either soda or tea. I had eaten at a Raising Canes a few years ago and would probably eat there again. Just not over somewhere like Chick fil a."}
{"text":"Just went there and not only had the worst customer service, my food was old. The fries were barely warm, chewy and flavorless. I have eaten here before so this visit was really disappointed. The chicken seemed to be the smallest, weirdest shaped fingers I have ever seen. Don't think I'll be back, there's a Culvers up the street.   Went back to Cane's for lunch today. We were welcomed by staff right away even though they were very busy. The strips were fresh and very moist and had good flavor. I appreciate the manager Ryan personally helping me with my order. I understand that sometimes things don't go as planned and they did make it right. I will be back!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm not a big fan of this kind of fast food chicken. But they do make a pretty good chicken finger. crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.   Fries are Ok and the sauce is growing on me. But one sauce? really? how about a BBQ sauce.  What I do like is the Texas toast - like crack - and probably as bad for you.  Their Ice Tea is good."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with Cane's. Great location fast services and I'm glad there's finale one in the arrowhead area"}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken strips!  The Texas toast is good.  Fries could be crispier...  The Cane's sauce is GREAT.  I have only been at the drive thru for this location."}
{"text":"This is by far the best fast food place in the Chandler area. The food is great, the customer service is great, the location is great. Everything about this place is great. The manager Josh is a very very good guy. Always in a good mood and his customer service skills are great. I love this canes. For sure recommend!!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME chicken everytime! Love it! If youre looking for spicy chicken, they dont have that here, but otherwise the chicken is GREAT! We get the platter with the fries, chicken & drink."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Warning.  Always check your meal before leaving now from this place.  Not really a good amount of fries compared to the other caines And left out the toast.  Black lady with glasses was in charge of the food coming out from the back today and she wasn't really good at quality control.   1 regular caniac and 2 caniac combos no coleslaw extra toast was the order.  Btw. Why did the teller say we were getting charged for drinks when the drink comes with the meal? Changed it to a 1 now since the sweet tea taste nothing what it's suppose to be. It needs sugar."}
{"text":"I've got to say I have been hooked  since the first time I tried their chicken. However, be ready to wait for a long drive through line or even the wait inside. Also I just asked for a cane membership club card and they basically said no because it was holding up the drive-through line. That won't stop me from coming back though. Their lemonade is AMAZNG. Make sure to make it a large!"}
{"text":"My sauce was forgotten and it ruined the whole meal for me. I really do like Cane's but I won't be coming back for a while because this ruined the whole experience"}
{"text":"After hearing my daughter rave about it we decided to try it.  I sent the girls down with some money and waited for their return.  We opted for the six piece chicken tenders, cole slaw, and French bread basket.    Chicken was good, especially dipped into their special sauce.  Cole slaw hit the spot and bread was also good but not great.  Fries lacked personality.  Overall, nothing special but not bad either.  The menu is limited but I guess it works for them."}
{"text":"Cool place to eat at, great chicken, and the people are friendly as well as fast.  I'm usually a drive through customer but the inside establishment had its positives, loud atmosphere at night, a lot of young kids mostly at this location."}
{"text":"As with all Raising Cane's this place is spot on! Over all I think that these are the best chains in the business. I love them no matter where I have tried them.   They are chicken strips only! If it isn't a chicken strip or fries you are looking for then you are SOL here!   The strips are the best though, I love the sauce, the sauce is very good, my only knock on them is that they charge you for the sauce's which to me is one of those condiments that should be included.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Well, this place certainly didn't live up to the hype. It wasn't nasty, but it wasn't what I expected. I got the 3 strip combo; my fries were cold, Texas toast lacked butter, strips were short and dry and the honey mustard (that I paid $.40 each for) was watered down. Meh"}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time. Read lots of great reviews about it. My opinion honestly its overrated. The chicken is an ordinary fried strip. No seasoning. The fries are plain as well. If u want salt grab yourself a pack or two for it. The coleslaw was a little sour to me, no one can beat kfc's one so far. The toast was the most flavored item. I was disappointed about it but I'll just move on. Hey its my opinion so there you go."}
{"text":"Chicken strips were smaller than the other Cane's locations. Otherwise it was nice and juicy. They were pretty generous with fries though. The service was fast and friendly. Would come back again if in the  area."}
{"text":"This place opened up nearby in South Chandler and wanted to try it out. Ended up ordering the Caniac Combo for the family which had 6 strips, fries, two sauces, and coleslaw. The chicken strips were really good having a good crunchy coating, while also having a moist inside. The fries themselves were a tad soft but it was tasty. The sauce is where Canes shined really well combined with the chicken. It had a good tang to it that reminded me a bit of chic fil a sauce but actually tastier in my opinion. The coleslaw was good but nothing special. Overall, you should definitely try out Canes if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered a 3 finger box and the food was outstanding. The only problem was the wait. I sat in the drive thru line for 25 minutes."}
{"text":"I never get to go to this restaurant but I did this weekend and the experience wasn't good at all. The place was full of trash and no one was cleaning it up. The Dr. Pepper didn't even taste good. The food was okay, the fries were bad they had a bad smell they should probably change cooking oil every once in a while. I would still recommend a place like this because one bad experience isn't going to ruin it forever."}
{"text":"I always come here when I'm craving chicken tenders. It's the best! They also have fresh brewed sweet tea and lemonade."}
{"text":"The chicken was hot and tender but not a lot of flavor. The bread was good but again nothing to rave over. On the higher price point for fast food chicken joint. Did not see why they charge a little more than the rest. I will say the lemonade was pretty good."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the employees are always nice and friendly, and the lobby and bathrooms are always clean. I would give five stars but the drive-thu is kind of slow. There can be five cars there can be no cars. It just seems like there is always a wait."}
{"text":"First time here at\" Raising Canes\" and I must say I'm greatly impressed. Not much to expect from menu with only chicken fingers, but simple enough to keep the line moving and the wait short. If you ever pay attention to disclaimers you won't second guess why your sandwich never looks like the picture on the menu; at Cane's there was no comparison. I have NEVER been to any food establishment that was so fresh. I ordered the chicken finger sandwich and it was excellent. Chicken was great and the lettuce tasted as if it just came from the garden, but what really got to me was the bun. The bun was really soft and lightly toasted and I can't say it enough, but Fresh! Nearly perfect especially if you're used to buns from other fast food restaurants. They also have a secret sauce that is quite tasty, really makes you wonder and always brings you back for more. Raising canes is a real fun place to stop and get a quick bite or take the family out. If you live close by or just passing through I highly recommend you stop and check this place out. 5 stars from San Diego!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed right now. The fries were soggy and the tenders were tough as leather. As busy as they are right now and as long as I waited in line, you'd think you were about to get some HOT, FRESH food, right? WRONG! I'm done with this particular location.   First time, shame on you. Won't be a second time."}
{"text":"The folks at Cane's have chicken down to a science. The quality is the same every time. Do you pay for it? Sure. But the alternative is to go somewhere else and get a possibly dicey product. The virtue of Cane's is that you never wonder. And that's amazing. Even more amazing that its a $6 lunch.  The fries are crispy and the buns/bread are buttery and toasty. The sauce is delectable. The drinks are small and pricy. The restaurant is cold--probably to keep the hot poultry grease odor at bay.  This location has a small outdoor patio. Very popular this time of year!  Who can blame people? I watched a kid clean the tables. He took his job seriously. I guess with the messiness of the food, you'd have to. I liked him,  when I went up to ask for a box, the girl acknowledged me right away, even though she was busy."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time. The food smells good in the drive thru. It was very slow.  A few problems were found. The chicken was good, but you only get two choices of dipping sauce, the house sauce and honey mustard. Honey mustard costs 31 cents extra, but I didn't want honey mustard our House sauce. I wanted BBQ sauce...Nope, not an option.  The Texas toast was yummy.  There is only ONE choice, well no, it's not a choice, you get a side of coleslaw. I don't do coleslaw, our house sauce, or anything's that appears to contain mayonnaise. The house sauce and coleslaw went directly in the trash.....I despise mayonnaise and can't look at it while I eat.   I gave three stars because the chicken and toast were good, I am not big on French frys, but these were nice, lightly crunchy, something different.  Despite the pros, I doubt I'll ever go back for the reasons listed above m"}
{"text":"My son and I ate lunch there recently and it was really good!  Probably the best chicken fingers I've ever had.  Ask for their special sauce because it's gummy!"}

There are a couple of things we can count on around here (Yelp): people who have no business belonging to the \"Elite\" fraternity will be in there, HQ is comprised of incompetent, minimum-wage earning goons who are forced to eat plain rice every day just to continue living, and there will be food (discussed). I digress.   Strips and a few sides is all they have. If you don't know this already, you might have been raised in a cave, or Alaska (same difference). Strips, fries, the damn 700 calories or so toast, coleslaw that is not fit for mammal consumption, et. cetera.   Strips are better than other chains. Sandwich made of strips is better than other chains. Sweet tea compels you to get up from your seat multiple times to refill.

They are usually so friendly, they might even inch out In-N-Out Burger® for the crown as friendliest service in this category. They take care of you when they mess up.   Customers It is so packed here at all times one would imagine that the food is free (or there is no other restaurant in all of Northtown)!  Firsthand experiences: I rode in the back of a motor vehicle filled with dudes -- no, not farm hands but dudes in the colloquial sense -- and walked in through the doors. I stood in queue. I ordered a sandwich. I paid with a Chase® Credit Card. I filled a cup to the top with sweet tea. I went into the restroom (men's) to wash my hands. The restroom was clean and well serviced despite the immense busyness of the restaurant. I washed my hands. I sat back down. I waited for a short period after that (approximate one minute) to be called, retrieved the tray (with sandwich), filled two little cups with ketchup, sat down, and begin eating. I ate. Et. cetera.

{"text":"First time ever coming here.. won't be my last. The deliciously seasoned fries. Fresh crunchy coleslaw and juicy hot chicken fingers with the buttery Texas toast has made me a fan! The special sauce and the lemonade are also Delicious! Great for families, very diverse crowd. Great for takeout or eating in. The prices are cheap! Imagine paying less than 10$ for a meal and it actually tasting good! Yeah this place rocks."}
{"text":"Good chicken fingers. A little loud, but fun."}
{"text":"Man Fuck Ricardo , this man won't let me finish a sentence before he starts guessing what I want, like take a breathe man,  it feels like an interrogation if that's what I really want.  He said have a good night before I could even say the word honey . I'd give 2 stars but my  Boi Erik works there and he's 5 stars in my eyes"}
{"text":"Good chicken, but I just found out this store doesn't want your business if you carry a sidearm. I was shocked to see the 'no weapons' sign on the door. I've been to the store on St. Rose and actually had two people thank me for carrying. I told the prude at the counter that \"the bad guy doesn't care about that anti-2nd Amendment sticker\". So, needless to say this anti-American store will not get any business from me or any of my gun loving friends. Let's pray for the unaware employees and customers."}
{"text":"This place is always good. The drive thru is always packed but it moves pretty fast. The staff is great and friendly. They even ask how your day is going. Tonight the girl even asked how long the line was. Their shift must go fast as they just keep turning the cars and orders as fast as they come in.   This was my second visit since the opening and the first one was as good as the second. The drive thru girl on the first one looked like the ketchup exploded on her  as she had it all over but other than that it went smoothly."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with canes. I love this place---service is outstanding, food comes fast and boy do I love their chicken fingers?!?!?!?! I'm not even a fan of fried food(call me crazy) but if you ever caught me eating fried chicken, there's not a single doubt that's from Canes!!!! Check them out guys!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you what we got here. Always crispy  always moist. I've always been a fan of Raising Canes and I was excited to hear that a branch was opening in Surprise. Grand Opening was on the 12/08. We came here a few days later and there was no line but shortly after we sat, there was a line out of the door. Drive-thru was constantly wrapped around the building. Holiday decor was nice. Employees are enthusiastic and the location is kept extremely clean. Quality was on par with other locations. I will always recommend trying Raising Canes to anyone!"}
{"text":"I don't normally review fast food places. Raising Cane's have been popping up around the valley and since I'm a sucker for chicken fingers, I decided to try them out. The menu is simple: chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast and coleslaw (and a chicken finger sandwich.) I got \"The Box\" which included, 4 fingers, Canes sauce, fries, Texas toast, cole slaw and drink. When I got home and opened the lid, I immediately noticed the fingers were much much smaller than anticipated (about 3-4\" long) The fingers  lacked flavor, were dry, and had way too much breading. The \"canes sauce\" had flavor, but very salty. The Texas toast- well it was just a thick piece of bread, nothing special.  So next time I have a craving for chicken fingers, I will go to my old stand by: Culvers!"}
{"text":"Great service every time I come here!  Not a lot on the menu but that makes it easy to decide.  The chicken, special sauce, and Texas toast are amazing!  Not the greatest fries but everything else makes up for it.  Hoping one day they put one in North West Peoria!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Was my first time there and ever even trying their food. Scrumptious, fresh and delicious. Anyone who wrote a poor review must just be working for the competition. Very, very good food. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb if you're a chicken lover.  My girlfriend and I eat here a lot more than we probably should. They specialize in boneless Cajun style fried chicken fingers and they do it very well. Sides are toast, coleslaw (which I have yet to try) and crinkle fries. I would suggest eating there as opposed to taking it to-go, the food is crispier that way."}
{"text":"Wow! It's been almost 3yrs since I've visited Raising Cane's. No, we didn't move. We just didn't bother coming back due to a lot of things.  Today, I'm upgrading my review to 4.5 stars. The chicken fingers taste juicier than last time, the staff were friendlier and not as jumpy, the music not as loud and they now offer military discount in all their meals(yeeeaaay!)  They'll get a full 5 star when they consistently clean their tables and floors.  By the way, what's the deal with the disco ball? Don't think it was there 3yrs ago."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The fries are good, and the chicken breading has a nice crunch, but the chicken itself is dry and flavorless. The sauce is a bit like ketchup, ranch and a ton of pepper. It's a decent meal in a hurry, as most stuff on that side of the street are sit-down, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"No mention on menu that chicken will be covered on both sides with red sauce.  I don't want or like sauce but since it was my 1st trip, I didn't know it would be automatically added.  The bun was saturated; the lettuce was wilted; both were tossed out.  Used paper towels to try to remove as much sauce as possible but it left a very bland piece of chicken.  I guess that is why they smother it in sauce. I called to tell them they should add sauce to the list of ingredients, but the girl who answered was too busy laughing about it so I hung up. Prices are high. Will not stop again."}
{"text":"Very good but I still don't know what the hype is about. Whataburger and Culvers still have better chicken strips. Subpar for a quick weekday dinner."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through. My drink was filled to the top with ice, so I had about 5 gulps. Only got one napkin (at least I got a napkin, but still). One ketchup pack for a big order of fries was not enough. Chicken was pretty good but the strips were leaning towards the small side. Overall not really a good experience."}
{"text":"I will always love this place. The chicken and bread is so good. The canes sauce makes this place special. Always great customer service. I am addicted to this place."}
{"text":"I would consider myself a Canes regular, but this was my first time at this location. Went through the drive-thru. Only a couple cars in front of me, nothing like I've seen it before. I got to the window after waiting what felt like a pretty long time, only to wait longer. I could see the screen that displayed the drive-thru times, and I saw my time progress to red, and then blinking red. Blood red. 17 minutes. What made it exceptionally painful is that it seemed like everybody was just standing around inside, two of the ladies eating fries right in front of me. My question is, where those my fries? Just a tip for those ladies..at least hide yourself from customers when you eat the customers fries. Probably want to hide yourself from the manager too."}
{"text":"I think it's time for a review, after all the times I go! 5 stars for their fresh fried chicken and toast. 5 stars with how quick it comes out. 5 stars for service. They all have a friendly demeanor and every time I go in, they're all working diligently and with great urgency!"}
{"text":"All this place needs is some TVs for Raiders games!  Great atmosphere for families, no beer and no smoking.  Sweet spot to take the softball team after the game.  Or the meetup after a round of disc golf!  I hear there's a disc golf course around here somewhere...  best service of any caines in Vegas.  Freshest hot food and love the fresh slaw.  Generous breast tenderloins too"}
{"text":"Brought my son & his friend here. They said alot of kids at school love the place, so they were eager to try it out. They had the Caninan meals. 6 chicken fingers, coleslaw, fries, & garlic bread. Also served with a large drink. This was $8.79.   Service was quick, we ordered thru drive thru. Paid at one window, at the 2nd window they passed me the drinks and then the food. All under 5mins!!!!   Food was fresh and hot when we got home. (10 mins later) The portions of the tenders are HUGE!!! It's good white meat portions. They were juicy & not dry also. My son enjoyed his meal, he had so much food he only was able to eat 3 tenders."}
{"text":"Decided to give them another try. Not trying to offend the Caininites but I didn't care for Cain's sauce. Ordered honey mustard the second go around and \"boom\" great chicken tenders. The staff was professional and thoughtful. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Been going here for a long time. Service is usually always good. But as of recent they must of got a new set of crew or staff. Every time I come here they would mess up the order or forget to include my extra sauce that they charge me for. Today was the third time. Come on guys I understand your training new staff but. Come on!! Don't charge me for something your not gonna even give me."}
{"text":"Amazing food as always and the service today was exceptional! The manager, John, was very friendly and went above and beyond making sure we were happy! Overall an amazing place to eat!"}
{"text":"Service at this joint was pretty slow compared to the other Raising Cane's I've been to, especially in the drive-thru. Almost every time I go, there are at least 5 cars in front of me. If you have a bigger car, watch out with the pavement separating the drive-thru line and the rest of the parking lot. It is very small and I had to be extra cautious to not go over the pavement when going through the drive-thru. Be extra careful with hearing your order, though, and double check before you leave. I've driven all the way home from Cane's to find incorrect food more than a couple times. Thankfully, I am not too picky. However, it cost them another star.  The inside is pretty clean and I do notice the staff pay attention to the tables and ensuring they are clean before letting other customers sit. It also isn't too busy, so there will almost always be seats available for you to sit in.  The food is definitely the thing that will keep you going back. It is up to par with all the other locations and it is probably not the best thing that there is a location so close to home. The food was hot and fresh every time I got them, so that's a definite plus.  Despite the cons, it is a fast food chain. As long as the food is still delicious, I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Good but nothing impressive. Very nice concept but overall the chicken has no taste to it. Would prefer other chicken type chains like KFC or Chick-Fil-A over this one in a heartbeat.."}
{"text":"location is not too bad. in my experience Cane's has always had spectacular customer service. and the food seems to always be made in a timely manner. furthermore the Cane's sauce is to die for. The only critique may be is that I expected the dining room to be a bit bigger considering its in a very high volume populated area. other that this by far one of the best chains out there."}
{"text":"Although I am very greatful they offer a military discount it is not consistent from one manager to the next or even the employees.  If you go use the drive thru they give you 10% military discount, but if you walk inside they give you 20%......dumbest policy I have ever heard of and the assistant manager did not have a response when I questioned him on why the difference on the discount.  Also, if I go and order for my family they only give my meal the discount because everyone is not present....again they need to work on the policy.  On a positive note the food is always fresh and consistent."}
{"text":"I want to love this place because I do really like their chicken tenders. Unfortunately for me, it's not worth the wait. It doesn't matter what time of day I've tried or how many cars are in front of me in the drive thru, the wait is always ridiculous. I tried one last time tonight and waited over 20 minutes, trapped in the drive thru.  Their menu is so stupid simple and literally only includes a few different variations of chicken tenders and French fries. It seems like you should have that down. I've worked in dine in restaurants that can produce an entire freshly cooked meal in less time. Perhaps you need more fryers? Better training? I'm not sure, but I can't recommend anyone try this place unless they have plenty of time to wait."}
{"text":"We have been dying to try Canes! We have been hearing from Friends and co workers that it's the best chicken going .. Ehhhh.. Both my husband and I found the chicken to be bland. It was hot and fresh yes.. But flavor and crunch were definitely missing . The sides were fries , bread & cole slaw . Again, nothing remarkable . The prices were higher than any other fast food chicken joint i.e.; chick-fil-a or Popeyes . Both have lower prices and better flavor chicken and sides ."}
{"text":"The foods great but the service sucks !!! Cashier threw the drive thru was rude ! Also what's up with her make up ? Not presentable at all !"}
{"text":"The food is good, a little greasy but good. The menu is simple and reasonably priced! It's usually pretty busy when we come here and the staff is nice and our food is quick."}
{"text":"Service is really good. Staff members take care customers really well. I will come back"}
{"text":"Thought it was really good. Was very busy but the wait inside wasn't too bad. Friendly service. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I can't believe people would actually give this place a 3 or 4 start. This is the best fast food joint out there chicken is always fresh fries and amazing. The sweet tea is just awesome. 5 starts all the way staff are nice and friendly and service is Fast."}
{"text":"Quick and taste good as usual. It's good to know if you go to the location in TX and in AZ you get the same quality and friendliness wherever you go."}
{"text":"We've been twice since it opened. The chicken is always crisp, tender, juicy and hot! The fries are hot and fresh. (Can be overly salty some times.) The lemonade is very good as well. Coleslaw is pretty standard. The Cain sauce it where they get you. Tasty!"}
{"text":"Since when did the start charging 35 for extra Cane Sauce?.. one sauce per 6 strips not kool!...and what happened to the customer always being right? Valeria was one Rude employee! I will not be returning to this location 99th & McDowell"}
{"text":"Review based on food only as the service was as expected for drive-thru/fast food  Not really impressed. The meat was good but the breading was lacking. It was just your typical fried chicken finger, nothing to write home about! It was also frustrating that we paid $32 for a 25 piece, chicken and sauce only, figured for that price I should also be getting a side of coleslaw and maybe a few Texas toast?  But we can say we've tried it. We likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Because they only serve chicken fingers I was hoping they would be amazing.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  It was just another chicken finger.  Their sauce and Texas toast were both pretty good, but I'd stay away from the coleslaw.  If you have a child who will only eat chicken fingers, this might be the place for you...if I visit again, I'll definitely bring my daughter."}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's and especially this location! All of the staff are friendly and helpful. I called in at 9:45AM and asked if they could accommodate for a catering order for 140 people today for lunch. Since it was last minute, I was expecting hesitation or a \"no\", but that was not the case! I talked to the manager, John, on the phone and he made me feel like this was doable, and it was! Our order was ready at the time I asked: 11:30AM. Talk about fast! When I arrived, he and several employees helped me out to the car. I absolutely recommend them, not only for food, but for their amazing customer service :)"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that customers would be \"Raising Cane\"? I ordered the chicken strip sandwich on Texas toast & those chicken strips were undercooked & tasted like they were drenched in peanut oil! I didn't even finish my meal!#Fries left over & everything when the main entree# Chicken strips tasted awful.   This Greenfield & Baseline location is one of newest locations. Listening to them in the drive-thru it sounded like the staff was having fun. They were loud & laughing; & I was happy for them until I tasted those nasty strips. The food HAS to taste right. It has to ALWAYS taste legit like the location on Stapley & Baseline. The Greenfield & Baseline location need to get it together; until then I won't be back."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers: A permanent staple on all kids' menus in America! And yet, after reaching a certain age, there's a mild degree of shame associated with going to a nice restaurant and ordering some \"fingers\" if you're over the age of ten. And this is where Cane's comes in to cater to those of us who still love to eat these crispy strips - age be damned!  Raising Cane's menu is extremely simplistic. You can get fingers or a sandwich (which is essentially the very same fingers between a bun). Sides that are typically ordered in a box combo consist of mediocre fries, delicious toast, and coleslaw. Nothing else.   The chicken, which is never frozen, is actually very good for a fast food place. Much better than what you can get at other places for this price (i.e. LJS, KFC, Culvers). Their sauce also works well, even though a few more options would be nice to try.  I do wish they offered more side options. I'm all for the straight-forward In-N-Out-style menu, but some potato wedges, mashed potatoes, or biscuits would be a welcoming addition for those of us who aren't a fan of their fries. Fortunately, I am, but other people might feel differently  Despite this minor qualm, their chicken is good and that's what they're all about, so I can't really knock them too harshly for anything else.   Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast casual chicken restaurant ever. I live in Utah and we don't have a Raising Cane's but every time we come to Vegas I have to eat here a couple of times at least ;) the service is great. The food is great. Great value!! Obviously the menu is limited but that's what the restaurant is - it's a chicken place :) I'm obsessed!"}
{"text":"I hate that this place is always packed but it's worth it.  This is usually my cheat day choice."}
{"text":"Everything was well executed here. Clean. Friendly staff. Fried chicken, fries, coleslaw, bread."}
{"text":"fried chicken.  fries.  nothing else - but for my first time, I thought it was expensive for what serving I got.   but, I vote with my money, and until I see a discount coupon or ad, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"WOW! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! We ordered the Caniac Combo through the clerk Mahaleah (who was very friendly by the way, which did help from getting just a one star) and requested it to go. We saw the server actually drop our order and haphazardly put it back in the container. We naturally assumed everything was replaced, but assumed wrong.  When we got home we were minus some chicken and about half our fries. The fries were also very soggy! We called to complain and spoke to Ned, who basically made us beg just to get something back. We can get a free combo when (or if) we decide to go back. Not sure we want to at this point. And not sure what the commotion is, because we were not impressed with the place."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were good and the place is clean, but that was about all that was good. The coleslaw has no flavor and the french fries are sad. The music was too loud and the child like employees were even louder."}
{"text":"While the food was good, the service left a sour taste in my mouth. I pulled up to the drive through at 11:30pm and order my food (to which I hear through a muffled microphone my server mimicking my speech, and pull forward. In front of me at the window Is a car that is clearly either good friends of the staff, or staff themselves, as they are engaged in a 10 minute conversation, sharing drinks through the window, and talking like there's not 6 cars behind them. Once I finally get to the window, they take my card, give me my food, and I drive off, all in under a minute.   Tldr:  Food 8/10 Service 1/10"}
{"text":"If you want chicken fingers that are moist inside with a crunchy outside, this is the place for you. For late lunch, we enjoyed the 6 finger craniac combo which is 6 chicken fingers, coleslaw, fries, slice of toast and sauce. The fried are just right, fingers juicy, coleslaw creamy, and butter toasted bread soft on one side, buttery crust on the other.  Now regarding service, the cashier misunderstood and charged me for a combo meal and two drinks instead of two combos. So, she rang me up for another combo minus the drink. The other cashier gave me complimentary cup since we had 3 in our party.  Great customer service."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place! They are alway smiling, and working hard! Everything is super clean and service is very fast."}
{"text":"I love canes but this locations is a joke and needs to get rid of all the staff and hire an entire new one because they are HORRIBLE. I live around the corner and like I said love canes but they can never get my order right and even then don't seem to try to give you better customer service.. On top of that they are the most stingy location when it comes to French fries. They honestly don't give you shit !! I've dealt with it long enough and at this point I'm over it."}
{"text":"bland overpriced boring food, never ever again, no flavor, barely breathing customer service here."}
{"text":"I normally absolutely love Raising Cane's, but this location is quite a disappointment. I ordered an unsweetened iced tea, tripled checked with the person at the first and second window, and still ended up at home with a sweetened tea. Also, the girl at the window had a very poor attitude and took like 5 minutes to get the single lemon that I had requested for my unsweetened iced tea. Aside from that, their other beverages do have a \"funky\" taste that someone else mentioned. Too many other options in the area to be opening a sub-par chicken joint."}
{"text":"Drove through at this location. There were easily 9 cars in front of me; thought about leaving, but my kids wanted Cane's. I was surprised on how fast the line moved. Very great service and product as always."}
{"text":"So for my  first time here, i had a good experience.  Order came out fast and good looked great.  Cane sauce hit the spot and was nice and peppery. Chicken was moist and fries were superb. I wish texas toast was a little more buttery. Soda machines seemed to be running out of syrup, soda was kinda watery and tasteless. Im excited to go back again!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me but Raising Cane's is not for me, whatsoever. I do have to admit that this is my first time here and maybe it's just this location, but I have a feeling it's not.   I'm not sure why anyone would like this place, the food is meant for the palate of a child.  1) The Chicken - there is litterally no seasoning in the batter, I'm sorry but what is the point of having anything battered if it has no flavor? Just adding carbs and fat for no reason? 2) The Fries - these remind me of some cheap frozen crinkle cut fries that you would get at the grocery store... especially ridiculous since del taco is right across the street and their crinkle cut fries and pretty good. 3) The \"Texas Toast\" - mine was only slightly seared on one side and the other side is raw, this is not appetizing and immediately gets soggy.  The only thing I can think of is that people like their sauce? and that you are suppose to just put it over everything and that helps make up for their horrible food? I'm not a big fan of mayo products so it wasn't for me."}
{"text":"This place makes 1 thing.  Why is the line always so slow.  Food is good but there's no reason this place should be this slow"}
{"text":"Ordered a 50 piece tailgate &thug of best lemonade!!! The crew was super friendly!!! We will be back! #FazeClan recommendations is spot on!"}
{"text":"This Cane's has some work to do if it wants to be on-par with the other Cane's around town. Considering it is the new guy on the block, and has not even been open for a full month yet I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that they are just working out kinks.  Location is spectacular for me, because I live on the Northeast side of town and dining options are quite limited. Parking situation is kind of iffy and they could have used a bigger lot - also, the drive-thru is always packed, but goes quickly more or less.  I've been here on two occasions and both times I've been slightly disappointed with my food.   Husband always orders the Caniac, I always order the 3-finger combo. At other Cane's in Vegas (Maryland Parkway and LV Blvd) they always throw in an extra \"finger\" - they don't do that here on Craig. Last time I was here the french fries came out soggy and sad. I'm used to them being crispy!  Lastly, both time I've been here there has been something quite OFF about the fountain drinks. I'm not sure what it is, but there's just an odd flavoring. Considering it has happened to me both times I've been here I'd suggest management take a look at the fountain, or their water supply.  I'm sure I'll be back, but hopefully they will get better with time."}
{"text":"Every time I give this place another chance I'm more impressed than the last time. My son and I stopped in this morning after an appointment and everything was great. Awesome service the second we walked in. The cashier even made my teenage son smile. Miracle , but seriously she was great. We ordered quite a bit of food because again my son is a teenage boy lol . I ordered a three piece meal and it was phenomenal. Chicken was cooked perfect and juicy. The breading was crunchy but not hard and over cooked. The bread was also perfectly not toasted and not soggy. Even the fries were cooked great. I'm sold."}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here multiple times a week. There staff is super friendly and the fingers are amazing. There is a reason this restaurant is always busy and I keep coming back. Plus they make their sauce fresh in house. Who else can say that."}
{"text":"Raising canes are my daughters favorite place to grab a quick bite. They have the best chicken tenders and lemonade. We live in Aliante, so we were elated when they opened up this location as it is closer to home. I have no complaints at all with their food. The tenders are awesome, Texas toast is delish as well, not to mention their special sauce with the crinkle fries. My problem is that Their staff are not trained or not aware of their policies. I placed an order over the phone as it was for 50 pcs. of chicken tenders  and 20 Texas toast. This is for my little girls Christmas party appetizers. I spoke with Johnny who was really nice.  He asked if I would pay for it over the phone or when I pick up, and I informed him that I will be there at a certain time to pick up and will pay in cash.  He said the he will write up the order and will have it ready at that specified time. Since I was short on time, I asked my daughters to pick it up for me. When arriving there, the order was not placed and my daughter was told that when paying in cash, their policy is that they will only place the order at the time of payment. What the freak!!!! Johnny did not mention that to me. Had I known, I would have paid over the phone. I called and spoke with a really nice lady, Katie, and she told me that Johnny should have mentioned this to me. Where's Johnny??? He was not there  Very frustrating. The only reason why I'm giving this store 3 star is because the food is good and my daughters like it.  But visiting this place again, not sure.  There's always the Centennial location."}
{"text":"Staff is always so friendly, food is always fresh and delicious, inside kept very clean! Drive thru is sometimes slow but I personally dont mind the wait I think its worth it. Most importantly, if you're a fan of ice, this is the place to go! Its the yummy, easy-to-chew balls of ice haha."}
{"text":"Perfect chicken strips. Pretty good lemonade. Like the sauce not to bad. They do serve Texas toast. That's nice to have with your plate. Chicken is only thing on menu. Kids that love strips  will like this place. I like it.  Pretty simple place to eat if in mood for a chicken strip."}
{"text":"We wanted some food late at night and went for something different. I didn't really want bread or any other carb as I figured fried chicken was enough of a late night sin. I was surprised to find out that it's cheaper to get the meal with 6 chicken fingers than it is to just get 6 chicken fingers without all the other stuff. Food isn't bad, it'd be nice to be avoid the carbs and soda and still save money though."}
{"text":"We've been to other locations and they are pretty consistent.  Good quality (this location is not the chicken seems dry and very very skimpy) the crust is definitely different then others also (almost like corn meal) instead of flowered batter.  The chicken itself is very very overdone (2nd time this had been the case).  Just not the best location of all the rest."}
{"text":"Tender and juicy chicken. Great prices. Good sweet tea. Everything I've ordered has been great. The sauce that comes with the chicken strips is delicious."}
{"text":"Good food but people taking orders frequently get it wrong and cook staff take shortcuts with customized orders."}
{"text":"It's an addiction...... It really is. I'm giving it a 3 star because of rude employees. The drive thru guy always seems like he's yelling at you. No manners. No thank you, nothing. I understand he's trying to be efficient, but you can also be nice at the same time.... But I keep going back.... Because their food is an addiction! Another reason why I docked a star was because the length of time it takes me to get my food. It always takes about 10 minutes for me to go through the drive thru with two cars ahead."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers in town! Drove 40 minutes from Northwest Tucson to here and it's totally worth it. Ordered a Caniac Combo and Sandwich Combo. Sandwich Combo is basically 3 chicken fingers with BLT and buns + fries. Caniac Combo has 6 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw and an amazing Texas Toast. The toast is surprisingly good, and I personally like the sandwich better than just chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Loyal customer in the past present and future. Best fast food chicken out there!! Food is always fresh and hot ready to fill your hungry stomach"}
{"text":"New resident to North Las Vegas and i've noticed this newest location that opened nearby to where we live and its reallll busy!  We decided on trying Raising Cane's one afternoon by dining in. As we walked in noticed the drive thru to be pretty busy as well.   We went straight to the counter to order and menu is pretty basic, not too many options which i like. I dislike when a place has so many things to decide from. Dont get me wrong variety is good but their menu is real standard and basic on what they trying to get across as their sale focus which is chicken strips. Haha.  We ordred one kids meal and 2 meals one that had 3 pieces and the other had 6 pieces. Total for all came out to about $18.  Food came out fairly quickly and was delivered to the table. Winner on the plate by far was the garlic bread! Ughhh, it was so good. The chicken however was good also but that bread is soooo good.   I gave it 4 stars just for the fact of the bread, haha. Im kidding. The chicken is nicely battered and has a good taste to it as well as the dipping sauce. Will have to give it another try and uodate this review! Get an extra bread!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight and was greeted by Jacob at the register! He was very respectful and attentive. When he brought us our food, he offered to get us extra napkins and a plate. I love this canes, the food is always great and the employees are very welcoming! Thanks for making our night Jacob!"}
{"text":"I go to this location often on my way home to grab dinner for the Family, great food, friendly fast service. Always a hit at my house for sure!"}
{"text":"If your a chicken strip lover this is the place to be. I love the Cain sauce!  The toasted bread is pretty dang good as well... The price is about what you pay at other places. Staff is friendly, and it's clean here... I didn't go into the restroom which I typically like to do cause a nasty restroom most likely nasty kitchen... But judging by all the staff I seen repeatedly cleaning I'm sure it was most likely clean."}
{"text":"So so good. This location is always packed in the restaurant and the drive through, but they get orders out quick and the food is worth a little wait. They only have a few things on the menu, which is probably why they can keep the quality so high!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Cane's after hearing so much hype but .. I don't get it.   It's so bland! I mean the fries were ok, nothing AMAZING, but that's about it.  I really don't get the excitement."}
{"text":"This is an excellent fast food spot for all your fried chicken tender desires. The dining room is open late. They have a drive-through if you're on the go. They even have Coke zero. But truly, the food is a step above the rest of the fast food restaurants, and arguably their chicken could go up against most casual dining restaurants I've been to that have chicken tenders.  Is it fancy? No. But it's darn good"}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service. Forgot our Texas toast not once but twice!!!! When we reminded them the 2nd time the employees literally looked at each other like we were speaking a foreign language. We'll be going to a different location in the future."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh may so gooooood! The greatness is all that is CANES!  just take a bite, one bite with that juicy delicious meat all succulent and sheeeit! Mmm, and that cane sauce, awww mannnn! It's game over. Fuggin BOMB SHIZZ!"}
{"text":"Love Caine's food but stopped to get a sweetened ice tea here and had to dump it. It was straight sugar water-like drinking Karo syrup. Obviously no one tastes what they serve to customers."}
{"text":"My kids love it here! It always busy but never a long wait that's always a plus when you have a bunch of hungry children.  They call you by name and bring your food to the table.  Everyone greets you as you walk in the door.  I love great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food. It's fresh but still a long wait. Even has improved from my previous visit."}
{"text":"This is my regular drive through for late night dinner. I work and do sports until past 10pm several times a week. Canes is my trusted location for a relatively quick and good dinner. 3 or 4 fingers with some fries is perfect.  The food is remarkably consistent and hot when I pick it up. It isn't the only place in the universe to make chicken fingers, but they have a good recipe and it tastes good.  Sometimes just being very good at one thing is all you need. Canes does that with chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Freshly made,hot and delish...service was great! First visit but not my last! Forget other chic places this is my go to place for lunch."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with Raising Cane's... the chicken is always good, the bread is fantastic, and the fries are solid. It does seem to get busy during lunch (big shock) but the food still came out rather quickly. Solid chicken and it's close to my office; both make it a winner!"}
{"text":"Chandler had been anxiously awaiting the opening of Raising Cane's and I wanted to wait a bit before writing a review because the first few rounds of a brand new establishment typically has some kinks to work out. What I would say about this restaurant is that it has some of the friendliest staff around. I very much appreciate that! The food is also good and the restaurant is clean and comfortable. No complaints."}
{"text":"If you like nothing but chicken fingers and Texas toasts then Raising Canes is for you. They have a very basic menu and that's ok because when you do one thing and do it well, it has to be good. The drive thru is usually busy, but it goes pretty fast.  Their menu is just different numbers of chicken fingers. You want a kid size order? That's 2 chicken fingers. You want more? Then there is the 3 Chicken Fingers option. You want double that? Then you get The Caniac which has 6 pieces of the chicken fingers. The combos are the way to go though. You get some crinkle fries and a drink. Besides the usual soda options, the sweet tea and lemonade is a tasty option to go with the classic meal. They also have party packs available too, but I'm not sure how far in advance you have to order it though. The dipping sauce is ok. It's like mayo and ketchup with pepper. You can get plain ketchup if you prefer. Service has been consistently friendly and my order has been correct, so that's always a plus.   Lastly, besides their moist and juicy chicken fingers their Texas toast is worth stopping by alone. I'm talking about super soft, buttery, and warm thick sliced bread. Yes, get extra toast if you've been good and deserve it. Good job Raising Canes. You have one job and you do it well."}
{"text":"Great food--I love their chicken. However, the dining room is always crowded so don't expect to actually eat here. I always have to get mine to-go."}
{"text":"My husband says, \"You and that toast...\" I do really love the toast, but the Cane's sauce is good, the fries are good, the chicken is good, the coleslaw is good..... I do not think I have had anything bad here.  I am not a fan of how expensive it is, but I do enjoy this every now and then.  My youngest kids share a kids meal.  One only likes the chicken, one only likes the fries.  It works out that way for us though.  I like them and go there once every two months or so."}
{"text":"So this is the \"In-n-Out\" of chicken places.  You literally have 4 choices, and that's it! HAHA! So I have only eaten food from this Canes twice; both times it was from the drive-thru.  Ill just list the pros and cons, for simplicities sake.  Pros: The chicken tenders. They are always super tender and delish! The sweet tea! Its spot on. The texas toast is \"ok\" Could use a little seasoning, or longer cook. I also like their \"Canes Sauce\"  Cons: The coleslaw is not the best ive had. It lacks that tangy flavor I prefer in slaw. The fries this time were atrocious. They were cool, and very undercooked. Straight up soggy.  My advice is if you want the best experience with Canes, dine in."}
{"text":"First off I need to find out on the picture of the little green bean that's in the middle of the chicken finger I need to know what that is I'm going to die that's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen you people need close down It looks like an infected toenail"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I've been coming here ever since this location opened and it has awesome costumer service. I usually go through the drive thru because inside is always a huge crowd lol and the staff always have a nice greet! It can sometimes be quite a wait in the drive thru line though too, since it's always busy. Can't blame them though! The food is usually to my likings- only rarely is it not. When it isn't to my likings though, the Texas toast isn't seared, fries are soggy, and the skin of the chicken falls off. But it hasn't happened that many times and they were always happy to replace!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here! The fountain drinks & lemonade....what is wrong?!  Please, for the sake of us all who love Cane's so much, please fix the funny tasting water so we can come back!  We live much closer to this location and now drive out of our way to go to another one because the water tastes so bad.  We've experienced this several times and finally had to stop coming to this location.  The lemonade from Cane's is the best lemonade out there but not at this location.  It tastes awful!  Please fix this and let me know so we can come back!  I want to update my review and will give 5 stars once fixed....the food is that good....and the drinks could be too!  Pretty please!"}
{"text":"This place just opened and is close to me.  I have eaten from there twice both times pick up.  1st expires me gets a 4 Star. The food quality was good we brought it home everyone enjoyed it but it was missing our extra cane sauces. Not that big of a deal.  2nd experience: approx 2 days ago went back. they honored our missing cane sauces from previous order. How ever when food was brought home and we ate. Very displeased either the quality. The fries were greasy some of the chicken was inedible. I went to bed feeling nauseous. (Possibly greasy fries) no body else complained of nausea.   I'm putting this review because I have been eating at raising canes for the last 13 yrs. I use to live in Louisiana. I love raising canes. I'm not gonna go to it as much if the location closest to me is already having quality issues. Please fix these issues. I love raising canes."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night at 6:30 it was busy outside but not busy inside our food was hot and we received it inside the restaurant within five minutes of ordering friendly staff clean surroundings very happy"}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time and one worker opened the door for us and another greeted us as soon as we walked in! Definitely felt welcome! I haven't eaten at a location yet, usually just take it to go so it was good to see how friendly and welcoming all the employees are!   The restaurant is clean and there are plenty of tables inside and outside. Also love that they bring your food to you and that there is someone that walks around the dining area to clean the tables after someone is done eating. Some restaurants take forever to clean up and it's gross seeing crumbs or trash on the table, so 5 stars for that!   If there was something I didn't like, the toast was really buttery so it was hard to eat without feeling like it was too salty. But overall the food was fresh and everything was amazing. Definitely will continue to come to this location!!!"}
{"text":"1st time to Canes.  Food decent, service is better than most.  Person who took my order called me buddy 4 times.  Im old school retail, what happened to sir or mam?  Im not your buddy.  Im your employer.  Buddy is way too informal.  Music really loud inside.  Person who brought my food out had to shout over the stereo.  Employees having a party in the front laughing and goofing off to add to the noise  When I went to sit there were 8 dirty tables waiting to be cleaned.  Hard to find a clean seat.  Canes is ok.  I might come back, but not for a while.  There is nothing special here."}
{"text":"This place is really big inside. service is great and if you go through the drivethru with your dog they have milk bones for them!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite's! i don't usually go to fast food places, but i just cant resist this place. First of all their sauce is amazing and goes great with their fries and tenders and they Texas Toast. They have many different sizes of meals, whether its more tenders or more sides like their coleslaw.I personally always get the kids meal. Which is $4.54 and it includes two chicken strips with fries and a sauce and a drink and some sort of puzzle fr the kids, lemonade is not an extra charge when u get it with the kids meal. i think it's the perfect amount to satisfy your craving. They also have some pretty bomb lemonade and tea which just so happen to make a great Arnold Palmer. Something else that is great is that they offer party platters that you can take to your office or big family."}
{"text":"Always a good meal at Cane's!  The chicken is tender and fresh, the fries are delicious and have been prepared just right every time I have dined there.  There could be more sauce on the chicken sandwich, but everything else has been just about perfect every time I have eaten there.  The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly.  The only thing I have had as a consistent irritant from my standpoint is the loudness of the background music. You wind up yelling at each other from across the table just to be heard.  If you go with a friend or friends and expect to have a pleasant conversation you will be disappointed.  Maybe that's their plan to keep the crowd moving, (enjoy the great food and leave to make room for the next guests?).    Overall, it's still a great value for the money, but when it cools down outside, I may use the drive-thru."}
{"text":"I dont know what the big fuss is about except that their chicken is never frozen and extremely tender. I would think since they only make chicken it would be fabulous. I found it kind of bland and the sauce is similar to Thousand Island dressing so that didn't help. Hubby really liked the Texas Toast and we both agreed the fries were excellent. I'd rather have chicken with a little more flavor and I know they used to have it in Texas. I believe it was called Ron's and was the best fast food chicken I've ever had. Make it like Ron's and you've got a customer."}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN FINGERS EVER!!! (This applies to all Raising Canes franchise)  The place itself was nice and clean and the staff is super nice and cheery. Personally have found out about raising canes recently and thought a place that mainly serves chicken tenders would probably be overhyped but I was wrong. Like I said. THE BEST CHICKEN FINGERS! The chicken was flavorful and juicy, something not everyone gets right.   I also suggest getting their tea.   It's really good."}
{"text":"After class some of my co workers and I decided to head over for a quick bite before heading off in our own directions.    Upon arrival, the restaurant was clean aside from some overflowing trash bins. My group placed our orders and sat at the big table near the checkout. One by one our orders began being called out. Less then 10 minutes after ordering and we all had our food (orders were correct as well). We all enjoyed our food and talked for maybe half an hour. The area was nice and fairly quite.   Food: I ordered the 3 finger meal. It was just the right amount of food for me that night. The fries were a bit bland as it seemed there was no salt or seasoning of any kind. Also, I did not get a Cole slaw that should have come with my meal.  Overall I had fun and the food was decent."}
{"text":"I love canes but we need to become more consistent on what the customer orders make it right."}
{"text":"I love Raising Canes.  The sauce is to die for, the chicken is always fall apart tender. These guys do one thing and they do it well. you won't get a better chicken strip basket anywhere else. Yes all of the food is deep fried but treat yourself sometime and check this place out."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich was great. Crispy with a bed of lettuce and cane sauce. The sauce is flavorful. Cole slaw was good, fries were not. They were cold, flimsy and had no flavor."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Raising Cane's since they opened in Downey, Ca. It's always so packed, and I never really wanted to wait in such a long line. I did want to see what the whole hype was about. My husband and I happened to go to Vegas this weekend and saw no line at this location. I said, \"Great let's go try this out!\"  They give you limited sauce. The bread needed butter and the fries needed salt. The oil they used to fry the fries must've been old. The fries were very bland tasting. They forgot about our order and so they gave us an extra chicken tender each. The workers are friendly, and the sweet tea was really good. The food was hot, so eat with caution because I burned my tongue."}
{"text":"Always good chicken. Much better access and parking than the one on Stapley. You can order ahead if you are getting a tailgate box. They had it ready for me and I was in and out in a minute. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow! I had heard that the chicken was great here and it did not disappoint! The food was up quickly. The chicken was a really good white meat and somehow stayed juicy! The sauce was good too! The fries could have been just a little crunchier is only thing I would change."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location. The food was still tasty, but the customer service was lacking. The person taking orders seemed less than enthusiastic to be there. At one point, I saw a young girl drop her cup of ice on the ground and was passed by many workers. After a few minutes of cleaning her own mess, someone finally helped her. Lastly, at the other locations I've been to, managers generally come out to greet and visit. The person I assumed to be the manager never interacted with anyone, even the workers."}
{"text":"First of all, we went through the drive through to order, we got home and took a bite out of the chicken and I saw some GREEN DISGUSTING STUFF on my chicken and I then took my time to go back to complain and hope for a new combo or my money back because it was just nauseating and the manager just made up an excuse and told me it was PERFECTLY NORMAL that it was blood. And some other cashier said it was ketchup?!?! I was very disappointed because who in the world would eat GREEN CHICKEN ! Never going back for the bad costumer service as well. I would've probably gotten sick from this."}
{"text":"It's nice to have other fast food options besides the usual fare. Food is always hot and orders always correct. The employees are nice and speak good English and don't often have to repeat my order. Never been on the inside, only the drive-thru. Simple menu and good value is why I keep coming back. They are kind of like the In and Out Burger of the chicken fingers world, with a touch of sports flair and rock and roll."}
{"text":"Just tried their new location in Surprise. All staff to a person could not have been friendlier, very polite and helpful. We had never eaten at Cane's before weren't sure what to expect, but a very pleasant experience! The chicken was hot, crispy and absolutely delicious! French fries average, nothing special; bread a bit soggy but very tasty. We ate on The patio as we had our dog with us although we took her in with us to order, the staff offered her a treat whip was so nice. They brought our meal to us literally within 5 minutes! Will definitely visit them again!"}
{"text":"The only thing good abt Canes is that the chicken is tender. The breading has absolutely no flavor and it's kind of soft not crunchy . They only have one type of sauce. The fries aren't great. The coleslaw is ok but the little piece of bread is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Perfectly simple menu! The chicken was not oily but crisp and tender. The sauce had perfect spice to it and the Lemonade was refreshing!"}
{"text":"I first tried canes after moving to Mississippi from Florida. When I left MS to move to vegas I was super happy to see they have them here too!  Crispy juicy tender fingers. Delicious real southern sweet tea. Simple menu, delicious taste.  All they have is tenders, fries, texas toast, cole slaw. And it is all done to perfection. They also have soft drinks/ tea. Yes they have unsweetened as well.    The food is always fresh and their dipping sauce is delicious.  I like to make a sandwich using everything that comes in the box combo( texas toast, cane sauce, fries, and chicken tenders. ) It's delectable!"}
{"text":"Staff seemed very unhappy to be there, more focused on talking to co workers than the customer. Dining room was dirty and not a single table was clean, as I type this a staff member wipes the salt packets off the table next to me onto the floor and proceeds to walk away as if nothing happened."}
{"text":"After the first hundred times childhood Taric was chastised at family dinners for \"leaving meat on the bone\", adult Taric swore to only eat the best boneless chicken he could find. No matter where you take me, I will literally never eat whole chicken, the way nature intended. I am a tender connoisseur.   So I finally made it to this chain that sprouted up out of nowhere, and I was pleasantly surprised! Prices were reasonable, and service was fast, Here's what's up:   Chicken: tastes like high quality meat, as opposed to thawed out or otherwise old. A notch above other chains.   Fries: The freaking best, I'm already hooked.   Texas Toast: I don't think it's that awesome compared to other toasts I've had,  but it's better than biscuits at a lot of other places.   Sauce: sweet AND salty so it'll be addictive. It's just science.   Another bonus is that this is slightly cheaper than other places. I think the massive 6-strip meal for about $9 after tax is legit, and easily split between two normal people.   Only complaint is it needs a bit more spice. Just a little kick of some pepper."}
{"text":"Mannnnn what can I say, I just love this place! They make it easy to order cause chicken strips are the only option (or a chicken strip sandwich). Always paired perfectly with crinkle cut fries and delicious Texas toast. My daughter LOVES that bread! The canes sauce is near perfection and goes flawlessly with the chicken strips. I'm actually getting hungry typing this. I always skip the coleslaw and do extra fries instead. I go with the 6 piece because I can't get enough but I'll let u decide what works best for you. Oh yeah, they even have the little round ice cubes(like sonic) instead of the big huge ones, for some reason that makes the drink taste better. All in all I'm always satisfied and the line seems to go quickly as well. If u haven't tried Canes yet you're definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"This is my spot! I've already reviewed the awesomeness of Canes so I'll just update you on the location. I've been 5 times now including opening week when lines literally wrapped around the building. Everytime my order has been ready very fast, hot, and exactly how I ordered it. The building is always very clean and the staff is friendly. A perfect addition here in Surprise! Oh and don't forget the Canes Sauce!"}
{"text":"Ever since I tried Raising Cane's in Louisiana, their chicken strips have been my ultimate favorite. My husband and I have gone to the Stapley/Baseline location since it has been open, so we were excited for Chandler to open one since it's closer. The food was obviously the same and always delicious. I do want to comment on the service tho. The young man that gave us our order just plopped it on our table and didn't say anything to us. It was rather rude - which surprised us because all other locations and employees were so upbeat."}
{"text":"As a big Raising Cane's fan, I think this location usually gets it right. I've dined in a couple of times but mostly have gone through the drive-thru. As usual, the drive-thru lines get long but my experience here has been that they go through the line really quick. The times I've dined inside, my only complaint would be cleanliness. I know I can't expect much from a fast food that gets a lot of traffic throughout the day, but there have been times when it was a slow hour and a lot of the tables were still not cleared.  Customer service has been decent so I have no complaints there. Overall, this is a pretty good location on the north side."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place? I had the 4 piece chicken strips combo that comes with fries, a piece of bread, slaw & a Canes \"special sauce\". I got my daughter the kids meal. I ordered through the drive through and asked the girl assisting me for an \"extra\" sauce. When I arrived to the window; it was a male employee that reiterated my order minus that added sauce. I told him that I wanted an additional ONE when I had placed my order. He then proceed to tell me that it's an additional.30 cents?  I said for one sauce? He said for each additional. That one more turned into him charging me for three more! After I left and picked up my daughter there was a styrofoam container with all inside. I was charged for them! The Cane's sauce isn't that special! It's most likely a simple thousand island dressing base with a bunch of chili powder mix in.  Chicken fingers were bland, sauce didn't really add anything more except cost. The bread taste less satisfactory than the Frozen NY Texas Toast garlic bread. Fries, frozen crinkle cutter/ aren't a stand out at all especially if there consistency isn't fried right!  Pricey & tasteless - won't come again.."}
{"text":"Good food, good price, consistent for fast food...never had a bad meal here.  Everything is always fresh, service is good, and their lemonade is tops!  Also, great location!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience with the catering services for our office party! They went above and beyond! Thank you team canes!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. So far 5 star review. Never had a problem here. Always friendly customer service and fresh food. Big place so enough space for everyone if you want to come and eat here. Really delicious chicken. With the best sauce."}
{"text":"Chicken isn't as big as other locations, but you know what? I don't really care. It could be worse, other locations could switch to having smaller chicken as well.   Up side; the chicken is tender, French fries are fried perfectly,  I love the bread, like usual lol. I can't say anything for the coleslaw since I don't eat it lol. Nothing against the Canes version, I just never liked coleslaw.  I see what people mean on the reviews about the drive thru, but to me, the wait wasn't even that bad OR 20 minutes. But I guess I just lucky? Who knows."}
{"text":"Average service. Drive Thru people seemed a little tired.  But that's okay, it's 11pm. But food was hot and fresh and she was polite. I mean comon who's had a bad experience at canes?"}
{"text":"Yea the line is usually always long, but it goes pretty quick. Food is always fresh and yummy. Best part about this location is customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we drive by this place, it is uber crowded with an insane drive through line. After reading the Yelp reviews, we decided to try it and boy am I glad we did. These are hands down the BEST chicken fingers I have ever had and I really LOVE me some chicken fingers.  The chicken fingers here are fresh, juicy and moist. They are lightly battered and fried so you get more meat for your money. Although initially disappointed that my choices for sauce were ketchup or Canes, the fingers are very well paired with Canes sauce. I was so hungry I burnt my tongue taking the first bite!  To me, the only combos to consider are the Box which is 4 chicken fingers or the Caniac combo which is 6 chicken fingers. Note: the tailgate specials only include Canes sauce. I didn't even give the sandwich a thought because it's all just filler!  There aren't too many choices for sides. You are limited to skinny crinkle cut fries, Texas toast (soft on the inside, toasted on the outside, not overly greasy), and coleslaw (light on the mayo compared to KFC).   Definitely try the sweet tea. It is not too sweet and quenches your thirst well. Service was prompt. The restaurant was clean and well maintained. I will be coming back again when in AZ and am wondering if I want to drive to Costa Mesa, CA to satisfy my newfound Canes craving!"}
{"text":"We come here often and there is always a line. Before today I had never been inside always did the drive-thru. I wish they would put another canes somewhere else that's also not to far from home because lines are crazy. They do move fast though, thank goodness. When we go, we always get 2 caniac combos and substitute the coleslaw for toasts and add 2 extra sauces.  I hate to run out of the sauce, once the sauce is  out I'm done eating. The cane sauce is so good!  I will continue to come because I'm pretty much addicted.  I'm giving a 4 because I hate the wait because of the popularity. Our order is always consistent, fast once we pay and the staff is friendly.  *In the picture posted we are standing at the doorway and with people behind us."}
{"text":"My first experience at any Raising Canes and I'll be back.  The location just opened and is extremely busy but they managed to put out a tasty product.  While the fries were a little less crispy then I like the chicken was perfect, the right ratio of breading to meat, tender and juicy.  I also like the fact that the choices are pretty basic, with the emphasis on chicken fingers they make it easy to select without having a ton of menu options to confuse things.  I don't usually get combos since water is my drink of choice but wanting to try a little of everything I got a combo and was glad I did.  The unsweetened tea and the fresh squeezed lemonade made an excellent Arnold Palmer.  Even with the huge crowd in the restaurant and packing the drive through the staff was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This isn't my sort of restaurant for a full meal since I don't do deep-fried stuff, but I was happy to sample my husband's foods.   We didn't go inside. We made an attempt to do the drive-through at 5:30PM on a Friday and the line was some 10 cars long, so we made a return attempt about 9PM and sped right through. Food was ready very quickly.  The chicken is crispy and hot, with high quality meat. The mayo-based sauce didn't interest either of us. It really needed a different sauce to add some oomph.  The fries were nothing extraordinary: warm, but not hot and fresh. I was reminded of frozen fries I could bake up in my oven at home.  The big winner here? The Texas toast. I'm a bread snob--I bake all my own bread--and THIS was the good stuff. If I had to eat at this place, I'd make my whole meal this bread. The cut is about an inch in width. The bread is super soft yet solid in texture, and is toasted just enough to make it crispy. Perfection in bread, people.  My husband wasn't very happy with his drink. The cup was solid ice. He had about two slurps of Sprite and that was it."}
{"text":"Great surprise! Crinkle french fries are really great. Coleslaw is very tasty. Chicken tasted very fresh, nice and crispy. Secret sauce is ranch and BBQ sauce I suspect. Tastes great with the chicken. Employees are very friendly and efficient. Will return."}
{"text":"My favorite chicken strips ever!!! The secret sauce is really good as well and you could never go wrong with Texas toast. The fries are ok. A must have fast food."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken and even better lemonade. I had this place a year or so ago at ASU and was glad to hear a new location would be opening close to me. Unfortunately they have been packed every night, but I guess that goes to speak to the popularity of this place. YUM!"}
{"text":"Very friendly cashier. I'm visiting from California. She was a shorter lady, curly dark hair. I don't remember her name. But she was very hospitable and prompt. Amazing. Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"Great customer service. People are very friendly. Temperature inside was just right. Food was delicious. I would definitely come back to this Raising Canes for sure."}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix to visit family and my niece brought me here. Love it!! Great food. The coleslaw was tasty but not enough. Sweet tea..perfect!  Friendly service. They bring the food to your table. Clean, comfortable environment. I never seen a fast food place keep the tables and floors so clean. They use paper towels to clean so it doesn't stink after they wipe the table.  After each customer, the table is pulled out, chairs moved out and tables wiped clean. Then the floor is swept. All by smiling staff! I definitely recommend visiting  here."}
{"text":"So good I would give it 3 stars bc..  really....  it's chicken tenders... it would really have to blow my palate away to give chicken tenders 4 stars lol..  but that's me...    giving it an extra star bc of the service.   Well deserved.  One particular gentleman,  sad I didn't get his name but he greeted all the customers with a genuine smile and spoke to everyone who came in.   Attitude is everything.   Most often it's is not what you say but how you make others feel."}
{"text":"Consistently good!! Young staff had me reminiscent of my young days. (Granted, we are directly across the street from the high school !!) Friend coming in hanging out. Good safe place to hang and meet your friends.  Then I realize I'm that old dude in the crowd... but the cool old dude... kinda like that cool uncle we all haha!!!   Tonight I went with the Box Combo... not a fan of the slaw so you can sub it out with an extra piece of Texas toast, cane sauce or extra fries. If your about getting he most for money... the extra sauce is only .29cents with toast at .99... so if your liking carbs get another piece of toast for the price or just skip and get no slaw and no toast with extra fries and a sauce!   Only concern I had was the size of my chicken fingers... they seem to be getting smaller! Still good, so dip to your delight!"}
{"text":"Twice now I've had problems, I think the people who work at this location are very nice and helpful. But seems every time I go there something is wrong"}
{"text":"Every time I come here there is a long line but let me tell you, it's a long line worth waiting for. They have amazing chicken strips and there cane sauce is THEE BOMB !!! Their bread is thick and fluffy grilled with butter and their Caniac with 6 strips, crinkle fries, cole slaw, and 2 sauces is well more then enough food. I eat 3 with fries and a bread and In the fridge for later or lunch it goes. I have never been inside the store but the outside is always kept very clean."}
{"text":"Simple menu + tender chicken = Good  Dropped in with the work team to try out Raising Cane's in Avondale, at the 10 and 101.  It's basically a Five Guys but with chicken strips.  Menu is simple and straightforward.  The four meal options are a quick picker's heaven.  Staff was nice and snappy with the service.  And the amount of food you get for the money is an excellent deal.  My team loved their meals.  That said, for me it's chicken strips, bread, slaw, good wavy fries, and a soda.  Par."}
{"text":"Good chicken tastes like homemade but without the mess. Good sauce too. Sweeeeeet tea!"}
{"text":"I waited awhile to come to this location after it opened because it's always poppin' and I'm a healthy eater on a regular basis. Alas, it cannot be forgotten that I AM a mother to an almost 5 year old boy- who loves his chicken tenders and fries. Rightfully so.   But if you've read some of my past reviews, he has food allergies/intolerances: gluten/wheat, dairy, eggs, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts and soy. He's only anaphylactic to shellfish and peanuts and sometimes we need a break from the gluten free/egg free/dairy free frozen nugs. So we take him to Cane's as a treat.  Before you think I'm an awful parent and subjecting him to copious amounts of batter-fried chicken, let me just say: NAKED BIRD. Yes. N A K E D. They make them to order so expect a bit of a wait if you dine in or drive thru. Sometimes they make me pull over to a parking space, but they always find me fairly quickly and it's really not that much longer. These tenders are juicy and still crunchy on the outside. It boggles my mind. How can something with no batter or skin be fried to crispy deliciousness? Good job, Cane's.   They've always been so friendly too! I don't feel like they find it to be an inconvenience. And frankly, I think they are better than the batter dipped ones. Maybe it's because I know how many extra calories the batter ones are and I myself don't eat gluten or dairy. While they can't be certified gluten free because it's fried in the same oil as the regular ones, it's never been enough to set off T Money's allergies.   We always share a Caniac combo, give dad the bread and coleslaw, and dig in. I'm too happy to not have to share the secret sauce and T is ALWAYS happy with ketchup. More importantly, I'm grateful to have a place so close by that can cater to our family's food intolerances and allergies that puts out consistently great food."}
{"text":"After having a not so great experience, I was contacted my the owner and general manager and they went out of their way to fix the situation and take care of me."}
{"text":"I am extremely unhappy with this location. This is the many times they screwed my order! Ordered Caniac Combo with no Coleslaw... I got Caniac Combo missing 1 chicken and with coleslaw instead of French fries. Food is not hot too! I have to end up giving to my dogs to eat.. :("}
{"text":"Very disappointed! This place came to us highly recommended, I'm not sure why. The only reason their getting any stars is because their sweet tea is delicious. My chicken fingers were quite small, my fries were cold and the only sauces that come with the chicken is their own sauce, honey mustard and ketchup. No ranch, what?! Not to mention the only side option: coleslaw. Gross.   Seriously, go to Popeye's for their chicken fingers, you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"I came to this place because of all of the fuss that's been going on about how \"great\" it is. I live in southern California and Raising Canes' are popping up all over the place.   The staff at this location was ok. The female who took my order was unprofessional , because she was arguing with another employee about what shift she won't work.   Regarding the food, the chicken was greasy and didn't taste all of that great. The French fries were fine as well as the bread. It's a good size portion for a person that doesn't eat much.   I would rather have Church's Chicken tenders, which are less greasy and tastes a lot better......and for a cheaper price.   Definitely not a fan of Raising Canes and will never attend another restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Took forever to get my food. Waited over 15 mins. It was just one meal for me. No drink or anything fancy. Just strips and fries. Restaurant was pretty empty and dirty. Employees seemed burnt out.   The food was cold when it came. It was not worth the money and time spent."}
{"text":"I love there food but I'm trying to order a tailgate platter for the first time. I call and some kid answered the phone and I tell him I want to order a platter and then he not listening n just keeps asking me what do I want to order... I just told you want I want to order"}
{"text":"Canes is so good! Though, this one time they did take awhile with my food and when I went to go ask them if my order was almost ready, they said it was ready for awhile. They told me that they just got the name wrong."}
{"text":"So quite a few of my friends told me about this amazing place called by the name of Raising Canes. I went to the location on bell near 10th st last night. The staff was very friendly, they all seemed happy to be there. I'm not sure when it opened up this location but it looks very clean amd brand new. They had fresh lemonade on deck and it was very good. The chicken tasted fresh, it was seasoned well and not too greasy. The sauce was wild good. They had louisiana hot sauce packets too. Since I couldn't get any tacos last night, this really made up for it. Thank you Raising Canes, you are the real MVP"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love Canes chicken here is delicious but the drinks... especially the lemonade taste like garden hose water.... PLEASE RAISING CANES TAKE THIS REVIEW AND FIX THE WATER ISSUE! I still come regularly each time hoping the drinks have changed... but sadly nothing yet."}
{"text":"Canes is bomb af always. But I got a box today, got home, and they didn't give me a toast, just the cold slaw fml."}
{"text":"This location gets immensely packed but they're service matches speed with the guests coming in and out. The food is good and staff is very nice which matches with an always fairly clean dining room. They do one thing here,  chicken, and they do it very well. They also have the ability to complete a large party sized order on short notice. They offer a military discount. Love that they have one of these on the west side."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Raising Cane's and see mass quantities of people lined up to get some delicious chicken, I think to myself: the vegans are losing this battle."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for chicken fingers and fries!!! An easy go to if the lines aren't too long."}
{"text":"It's become a tradition that every time my friend Brittney comes to from Colorado, that we visit Raising Canes and grab a movie.  The first time I'd been to Cane's, I had never been there before obviously, she had recommended we try it and when I did, I thought it was enjoyable. Really quick, simple and decently priced. I got The Box Combo which comes with 4 chicken strips, a side of fries, coleslaw, toast and Cane's sauce. This was definitely more than enough, it is a really hefty serving! I really liked the chicken because it was quite juicy and not dry, the Cane's sauce is also pretty tasty but I wouldn't say anything else about it being extremely exquisite. It's mediocre fast food, nothing too special, but nothing is wrong with it either.  Also, prepare for a crowd when coming to Cane's. It is always packed up in this joint. Some days service is faster, some days it's slower.  I don't find myself craving Cane's, or becoming a regular but I definitely find myself coming back when Britt is in town!"}
{"text":"Wow. So disappointed in the staff. It was a warm Sunday evening and my family and I had decided to make Raising Cane's our final stop for the day. I was trying to enjoy a nice meal with my family when a young woman decided to start using obscene gestures and language with a guest. It appeared to be in a playful manner and no harm seemed to come from the gestures and language. However, one of my younger boys noticed the gesture and decided to replicate it. I had to tell him several times not to repeat the gesture but it was all in vain. The next day I received a call from my son's school that he had been showing other children the middle finger. I can not describe how shocked I was to hear this. Upon finding out that such atrocities had taken place I knew that it had stemmed from the night before while at Cane's. Great food, great service, disappointing staff."}
{"text":"Food is exactly what you'd expect - relatively bland, and over priced for what it is.   Service is on par with any fastfood restaurant.   Cleanliness is where this store goes above and beyond expectations. They'll actually spray your arm with cleaner for free while cleaning the table next to you! While I appreciate the attention to making sure tables are cleaned, I am not a fan of having whatever cleaning agent you use sprayed on me while I am eating."}
{"text":"The first time we went to a Raising Cane's, we got it at the drive through window and I wasn't terribly impressed. There are so many options for fast food in the valley that you can be selective! Fast forward a couple of years and we decided to give it another try. What can I say, it was in the right place at the right time.  The menu is really simple. If it helps, this is like In-N-Out Burger for chicken fingers. You can have fingers, fries, cole slaw, Texas toast, and a drink: soft drinks from the fountain or un/sweet tea. Freshly-squeezed lemonade is an upgrade. You can get the pre-defined bundles (\"boxes\") or build your own by selecting the number of items a la carte from the menu. The kids meals come with a \"prize\" and there is a sandwich: chicken fingers served on a bun.  We have eaten in the restaurant both times so far and the chicken has always come out hot -- sometimes so hot that it needs some time to cool off. Not a bad thing. The cole slaw has some crunch to it (also a good thing), and the Texas toast is fresh. They did forget the add-on toast on the kids meal, but it was not a problem to resolve that. The fries are not my favorite thing, nor are they anything special, but they're usually OK.    My wife and I noticed that they keep the place really clean: almost as fast as people can get up from the tables, an employee is out cleaning it off for the next person.   The sweet tea is plentiful and tastes fresh. Apparently, it is brewed several times a day and they use pure cane (ha!) sugar."}
{"text":"Normally I don't read or write reviews about fast food places but I wanted to say that the manager at this location has done a great job training their employees.  Every time I've gone everyone has been way friendlier than normal at a fast food place.  One employee in particular, Tony, was extremely friendly and helpful. I came in one night and the dining room was fairly empty but they had a big drive-thru line.  Tony acted more like a waiter than just a fast food employee.  He gave me an update on my order's progress and brought it out to my table and checked to make sure everything was OK.  I told him I'd give him a mention on Yelp so here you go Tony!"}
{"text":"My first time ever here and it was pretty good.  The service was excellent too -- the staff were very helpful.  My only displeasure is that they charge 30-cents for extra sauce; which is more of an annoyance than anything (running you credit card for 30-cents each time your kids want a new sauce)."}
{"text":"This was my first time at any Raising Canes.  I don't know how I made it this far in life without eating a Raising Canes chicken tender. All other chicken tenders pale in comparison.  The toast was the perfect combination of soft and crunchy.  The only problem I had was when I got here I asked for the key to the bathroom and they had to get a manager to let me in.  It took a while and he didn't seem too apologetic.  Next time I'll just pee on the floor!"}
{"text":"I really love the chicken here really friendly people no complaints from me I will highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I HATE THIS PLACE!!!! I have never said that in a review before and I'm at 100 reviews. I have given some places one star before but NEVER have I said I HATE a restaurant. But it is a fact, that is exactly how I feel.  I gave it another try today, and it was such a bad experience!! First of all, I registered for a buy-one-get-one free deal on their website. Since we were going to be at the tire shop that shares the same parking lot, I figured we'd give it another try. Well, when I presented my registered card (that I picked up on my first visit) I was told that it takes 7 to 10 business days for my card to be activated for the deal???? NOWHERE did I see ANYTHING indicating it would take DAYS for activation!!! I even received an email asking me to confirm my registration, which I did!!  So, I ordered anyways, although annoyed. Well, after over 15 minutes of waiting for fast food little fingers, I heard my name called as the employee is walking towards us with our order. She was called over by another table who claimed OUR food!! She was placing OUR food on their table when they realized it wasn't their food. She had OUR food in front of their faces and almost on the table. They recognized it was not their order so she took it away and came towards us.   There was another table sitting next to us. Their food WAS ACTUALLY SERVED to another table!! This time it was a duplicate name. The guys next to us got up and took their order from the other table!! They KNEW it was theirs because the two of them ordered extra bread and that isn't typical!! WHAT A TERRIBLE SYSTEM!!!!  They offer ONLY a FEW CRAPPY DIPPING SAUCES!!!!! No ranch, no BBQ, no buffalo. I want some decent choices because their chicken has NO FLAVOR ON ITS OWN!!!! The fries are very crappy, frozen crinkle fries (like you find in the frozen grocery store section, the generic brand), and ours were just pieces from the bottom of the bag.   Last time they asked us which sauce of their crappy choices we wanted. Not this time, they just gave us their \"special\" crap sauce. It was really no big deal because I brought sauce from home (YES their sauces are that CRAPPY!).   Their coleslaw is also tasteless and it actually reminds me of school-type cafeteria food. I LOVE coleslaw, but his stuff ended up in the garbage.   Okay, why the hell are knives held behind the counter as if they are a deadly weapon?? I have a kid and need to cut up his chicken fingers because he likes LOTS of lemon juice on his chicken (which I also brought from home) and it's messy so he eats it with a fork. I had to go back to the counter and WAIT to get a knife while my food got cold....not having thought to pick one up before our food was delivered.   Oh ya, I must comment on the price: Plan on spending close to $25 to feed two average adults and one small child!! I can think of way better options for the price!!!!!"}
{"text":"So if you haven't been to Cane's get in your car and go there immediately.  You need to get the chicken coleslaw fries and if you like sweet tea you will love Cane's sweet tea.  Ask for a little extra Cane's sauce.  Then sit back eat and enjoy.  Service is always friendly as well.  A great stop for quality and quick food."}
{"text":"Horrible, just opened and should have put their Best foot forward, however everything was wrong. Size of chicken fingers was half of other locations, poorly presented, place was so loud you could not even hear server call names, music was so terribly loud it was annoying, where was management in a new store, should have been in top of all this, never again!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Went here for teacher appreciation week as they were offering free meals to those who work in education and they made me a fan. I would never think to stop here but I'm so glad I did. I really can't say enough at how these were the most perfect and delicious chicken fingers that I've ever had! They were so flaky, so moist, and so overall amazing that I had no idea they could taste so good. You also get a good amount of fries, Texas toast, and coleslaw with your meal. Totally worth around the $8! It was so good I went back the week later."}
{"text":"I've been here two times the first time the sprite was flat then I was given a second one and that one tasted like nasty old water, my husband tasted the sprite and said it even smell like mildew and tasted disgusting. The second time I got a hair on my fries and I called and spoke to the manager and said that to just go back and they would give me new one, since I was on my lunch hour I couldn't go back same. Customer service it's ok I've decided I was gonna give them a second chance since they are the closest one to my house but now idk."}
{"text":"Terrific staff first off!! The chicken is fantastic, but I return there for friendly service, no matter the age of the worker they all are so helpful! There was a gentleman there that knew a lot about everything there, I always enjoy our interactions."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Cane's. Not sure what is so grand about it either. First, so loud it is like an absolute zoo in this place. No organization either. Some young kid comes out and screams your first name, sets the food in front of you, only to find, there are two people with the same first name eating there. Shocking!!!   She just grabs the baskets and walks over and sets them down at the correct table. My husband went into the bathroom and said it was so small it only had 1 urinal, one stall and one sink but several guys waiting to use each. How about a door lock if you can only accommodate 1?  Additionally, the food had pretty much, no taste. Happy it wasn't loaded with salt but some seasoning would be great. Basically if you don't dip it in a tub of condiments, it is flavorless."}
{"text":"Zara is literally the best! They need to give her a raise every time I come I'm greeted with a smile (takeout) or a hug (if I go inside)!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's does one thing, and they do it pretty well. They use nothing but fresh, juicy tenderloins that are made to order and they are consistently executed well. We've been coming pretty regularly now that they've matured past any growing pains and have been pleased with every visit.  This location is found in the ever growing and expanding southern end of Stephanie just north of the 215. The location always seems busy but the kitchen consistently pumps out each made to order chicken tender in less than 10 minutes. Accompanying your tenders will be crinkle-cut fries, cane's sauce, Texas toast, and a beverage with a 3 finger combo all for the affordable price of $6.19, quite a steal in my book. You'll get coleslaw additionally to your 4 or 6 tenders with your box combo or Caniac combo respectively.  Although the dining room is usually packed with tables hard to come by, I would advise dining in unless you live within 2 minutes. You'll be able to dig into your crispy combo right away after a friendly employee calls out your name and delivers your food to the table. If you order to go, you'll lose that crispy texture of the tenders because you'll get a steaming effect from the take out box as your order sits idle on the ride home.  The coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries, and Cane's sauce are just OK to me and I wish they had another sauce or two for dipping. But I really like the buttery Texas toast which along with the consistent tenders will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Not much for fast food but this place is great. The chicken is moist and the sauce is fantastic. A must try."}
{"text":"Foood was bomb! I love their Texas toast and fries. When our food was ready an employee brought it to us. The only thing that I had a problem with was the cashier. He had an attitude while I was ordering but overall I love the food."}
{"text":"Usually very happy with this location. Food is good and high quality. I wish that the Cashiers would ask for your Cane's club card each time though upon paying because I forgot to have her scan mine yesterday and would have received the Father's Day BOGO box combo. After we ate and went home then later I saw my email from Cane's about that special.  Disappointed because my husband was There and it was Father's Day. Your cashiers should ask for Cane's club card each time they're ringing people up!!  Especially to encourage people to apply and especially when you have a special like that on Father's Day going on!!"}
{"text":"Raising canes always hits the spot. Their food is unique to any chicken fingers in town. The service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Seriously the best fried chicken. (Don't tell my grandma.)   The staff is always friendly at this location.  The 3 finger meal is probably the best option for someone looking to have a great lunch. It comes with a side of fries, a piece of toasted bread, and a drink. The dipping sauce is probably the most surprising part because it isn't too salty but tastes amazing.  I used to drive an hour and a half from St. George Utah just to eat here."}
{"text":"Damn, I guess I'm never going to become a fan :-(.  This was my 4th time at a Raising Canes, and I keep trying to like it, but I never do.  Brand new to Surprise, I had to try it.  Meh.  I went through the drive through and was greeted with a \"Yo, yo, yo, we got chicken fingers to go!\".  While I appreciate the \"coolness and hipness\" of the younger generation, I did not laugh or giggle and it caught me a bit by surprise.  Anyways.....I went with a Box Combo which comes with 4 chicken fingers, slaw, toast, fries and a drink.  A little over $8.00.  Here is how it was............  Box Combo-  This is their most popular combo, and I can see why.  $8.00 for a fair amount of food is a decent price.  What is not decent though are the damn chicken fingers.  If that is your signature menu item, and they aren't even good, wtf?  The chicken fingers were a decent sized, moist and cooked properly, but they are B-L-A-N-D!  Ever heard of salt and pepper?  Maybe sprinkle a little bit of that shit on these things?  Maybe?  The fingers also got a little bit greasy/soggy on the bottoms of them due to the styrofoam container they were in.  Steams them a bit with not a whole lot of place for the heat to escape.  Did I eat them?  Yes.  Did I enjoy them? No.  Friends, coworkers etc always rave about Cane's sauce.  I am not a mayo based sauce fan, so I don't eat theirs.  Maybe that is the ONLY way to make these chicken fingers taste good?  Plain, by themselves, they are meh.  The sauce has to coat that blandness and at least make them somewhat good.  Right?  Sadly, I'll never find out.  The other items in the box were pretty good.  Hence the 2 stars.  Fries were of the crinkle cut variety and tasted fine. I noticed that those were not salted a lot either.  Do they even have salt and pepper here?  Cole slaw wasn't bad (once again, not a mayo fan) and I had a few bites of it.  The toast was good.  They serve Coke products and use crushed ice which provides a nice icy cold drink.  I think this is probably the last time I am going to Raising Cane's.  If I've been 4 times already and don't like it, I doubt I ever will.  Much prefer Popeye's, Church's or Bush's chicken strips over these...any day of the week!  2 stars.  Exactly what it is.  Meh....I've experienced better!"}
{"text":"It is what you would expect from Cane's. Very clear restaurant with great friendly service.   Chicken strips are good. My favorites are toast and lemonade. Fries are good too  I feel it is good value.  Caniac is big enough to serve  two"}
{"text":"Service here is awful everyone acts like you're a burden to them we were nice and asked nicely for extra sauces but they wouldn't because \"there's already some in there.\" I'm willing to drive farther away for better service."}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way home to Los Angeles from Las Vegas. Absolutely love this place, menu isn't that crazy big and is straight forward. Service was super fast, was able to get in and out on our way back home.   I shared the 6 piece and got some lemonade. Everything was great. Not too fond of their special sauce though, would just stick with he honey mustard and ketchup."}
{"text":"Very good and quick place to get food.  I like the chicken fingers, fries, cole slaw, and toast in the combos.  Ordering is quick and efficient.  Getting you food takes a few minutes but when you get your food, it is as expected hot (except for the cole slaw) and tasty.  Their people are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Best chicken strips. Period. I don't 'do' fast food chains but I almost wrecked trying to pull into Cane's!  Great fries, great sauce, great toast, great tea, great service. Yummmmmmmmmmm!!!  I kid you not!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite chicken place. I came here on vaca from California and I got the wrong order so I went back they wouldn't make my chicken or fries crispy and had an attitude when I simply asked for the right order. Hope all the canes don't have this kind of service."}
{"text":"I fell in love with canes when I use to visit my dad in Mississippi. So when one was opened here  I was so excited, tastes the extract same. Amazing chicken tenders so crispy and soft,nice soft toasted garlic toast, crisps fries. they always let you get extra toast if your not a fan of coleslaw. True southern sweet tea fells like I'm back in the south when I take a sip. It does take around 15-20 minutes in the drive through sometimes but it worth it for true southern chicken tenders. Plus it's pretty cheap on top of that. So if you like chicken then you should try it."}
{"text":"I love canes it's amazing, the chicken is so juicy. The toast with a hint of garlic salt is delicious. Somethings my fries can be over salted but that's the only negative thing I can say. I think everyone should try it once in there life way better then other fast food chicken."}
{"text":"This is my third time here, first time reviewing. We always go through the drive thru. I have never had an issue with my order or customer service. I'm usually not a fan of chicken tenders, these are the best and even with the drive home they are crisp and warn. I don't know what they put in the sauce but it's the best. I could go on and on about foods that are the best here, cole slaw, sweet tea and lemonade. This is one of the tastier fast food picks. This is a must try"}
{"text":"There is always a long line no matter what time and day of the week in the drive thru and also inside and there was this one time where I had to wait for my order for 40 mins because they keep taking other orders that weren't in order that really tick me of"}
{"text":"Never ceases to amaze me how busy this place always is. Even with the constant flow of customers the staff is always polite and friendly. Got our orders correct on on my way back home as quickly as they could. Food was as normal good, kinda feel like chicken is getting smaller in size but sauce is now filled up to the top didn't need all the extras like we normally do. Overall normal great experience as can be expected from Canes"}
{"text":"I was so excited when this one opened because it's close to where I live, but it's a headache getting food from here. I know they're new, so they're busy and the staff are still getting used to everything but I usually sit in the drive thru for 20-30 minutes, they never get my order right, some of the staff is very rude and gives me an attitude, and the first time I went inside to eat two of the staff members were mean to each other in front of guests and giving each other attitude and talking bad about each other to their other teammates. If you live close to this one I suggest driving a little further to go to a different location."}
{"text":"Yes - all they sell is chicken fingers.  I always dine inside so the food is excellent and not dependent on any to go containers impacting the quality of the food.  The fingers and cane sauce is perfect and the meals are a great value.  Chicken fingers, fries, bread, lemonade, cane sauce all for under $10 bucks.    What is not to like?  \"Dip chix in dat orange sauce\" = excellent taste!"}
{"text":"Great service people are very friendly, Justin who took my order offered to have them cook my to go order before I left with my coworkers. Place is kept very clean, staff walking around while others watching the front making sure everyone is taken care of.  Definitely recommend lunch at this location!"}
{"text":"I always love the aura of Raising Cane's every time I walk in. It was around 6 pm on a Saturday and surprisingly it wasn't as busy as I expected it to be (inside). The drive thru on the other hand had a pretty long line. The food is always great and I can't complain. One thing I'd improve on is the cleanliness of the soda bar / utensil area. Staff was very friendly! This was my first visit at this location and I'm not too fond of the parking. Having one lane and it being a one way lane was quite confusing. Cars coming out of the drive thru while getting in and out of the parking lot is a call for an accident to happen. Love the place and love the food!"}
{"text":"I've never tried Raising Cane's until a few months ago in Las Vegas when my auntie who is a resident there was raving about it.   Its my first visit at one of these establishments, instead of doing the convenient drive-thru, I wanted to see inside and get familiar with their menu.   Definitely, their Chicken Fingers is their specialty here. Having them itself without the sauces doesn't do much justice in taste. The Cane Sauce gives it a cajun peppered flavor, and sure enough this pink mayo really brings out that hint of Orleans experience. Also, they're meatier, I guess when they are meant as Chicken Fingers, it's way thicker than your thumbs. Combined with its Cane sauce, this taste way better than Popeyes chicken tenders that is already seasoned.   Since we ordered the box combo it comes with crispy Crinkle Cut Fries and if your thinking of an alternative away from ketchup, it's best to use the Cane sauce. The spiced flavor of the sauce can get addicting, so one wouldn't be enough I would get more.   Finally, from the box is the additional Texas Toast to complete the meal. Once you bite into them they're fluffy and chewy inside, with lightly crisp ends on the outsides. And it does have a buttery and garlic taste to them.   I've seen a few Raising Cane's close to home and honestly I thought they would be an average fast food joint. Thanks to my Aunt Cora, I'm impressed with this chain from the south."}
{"text":"This place is worse!!! I wrote them a poor review about 6 months ago. I was contacted after that review by the owner, Andrea. She asked me to contact her. I was told they are working on management and the drive-thru issues. I was asked if I would give them another chance....well I did tonight. They sucked worse!!!!! The usual wait forever in the drive thru, nothing has changed there at all. As I drove through you could see the teenage employees laughing and talking with each other holding up counter tops, while the line just gets longer and longer outside. They are in no hurry whatsoever to get to you. When I arrived at the second window (on 05/15 @ 8:00pm) to get my food I asked the young man why exactly their line is always so very slow. He smiles and said....\"You tell me, you just sat in it!\" \"We are worth it, everyone complains but they still come back now don't they!\" Well not me, not anymore. I am done....taking my hard earned $ and time elsewhere and my advice to others is to do the same! RAISING CANES GOOD FOOD = SUCK SERVICE"}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times since  they first opened. It is hard to get excited about chicken tenders, french fries and texas toast but they seem to have a good crowd. Think I prefer grilled chicken at El Pollo but it is all about personal preference."}
{"text":"Asked for a 3 piece combo without fries and extra coleslaw......received 2 pieces of chicken,  toast and sauce.  Called and the staff whom answered was not even paying attention to what I had to say to the point I repeated myself multiple times.  Finally gave in and told her to educate the staff"}
{"text":"Took my son and his 4 friends for lunch last week.. Although it was crowded, we were greeted as soon as we walked in. All of the boys ordered as well as had a special request (extra toast, crispy fries, etc.) All food was brought to our table by sweet friendly server and it was all correct !!!  The chicken is served hot,fresh and this amazing sauce that you cannot get enough of.. they serve the best crinkly fries and Texas toast!!!Restaurant is clean and plenty of seating !! The boys love Canes and asked to return on their next half day of school!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.. Not impressed with the food.   Nothing like Zaxbys, not from here sorry."}
{"text":"We had some family come and visit us today and they brought us lunch from Canes. We've never heard of it but was very happy with the food. The chicken breast tenders was moist and that sauce...so good. I used it for both the fries and chicken. The kids meals are really good portions also. I'm excited to know that this establishment is right down the road from (like most places here).   We will definitely be regulars here! And I forgot to mention, it's a drive-thru. I did not realize it till I looked it up and found out it's a fast food joint. Ok, I'm a sucker for McDonalds but I'd rather go drive-thru Canes!"}
{"text":"Pretty good chicken and good portions. The chicken strips were nice and crispy.  The special sauce was different and tasty.  The Teaxas toast was toasted just right and not too salty. Not a fan of cole slaw, but it does come with the meal.  The fries are the crinkly fries nothing spectacular but they are tasty too."}
{"text":"Great food, service is consistently slow...sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes....unacceptable ."}
{"text":"First bad visit to Cane's ever! And of course it's the one close to our house. I'm not happy at all! I went in to pick up food for my son for dinner, and I get in there and when I go to pay, they ask for id so I go back to the car and get it, then come back in and there are 2 people in line, so I'm waiting. Just when he's about to finish with the second person, the other girl opens  and takes my order. Guess what, after all that she didn't ask for my ID. So I was a little irritated they asked for my ID, but glad for safety, but then after going back to get my ID, waiting, and then not to ask for my ID has got my blood boiling! I'm very irritated, and I did talk to the manager but he was speechless. I'm very upset with one of my family's favorite places right now and will try to avoid it for awhile."}
{"text":"Food is good but very poor service. Tried to get our table cleaned and ended up Doing it myself. My request was ignored ."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken sandwich on Texas toast instead of the bun and it was really good. I went through the drive through which moved pretty quickly and the cashiers were very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"I like Raising Canes. BUT the drinks at this location are disgusting! No matter what drink you order, there is this very chemical, disgusting water taste. I have avoided going many times specifically because of the drinks. Not sure what's going on with that but the drinks are not drinkable! Something is up with their water for sure!  Update 6/24/2017 They're drinks still taste like sewer water!!!"}
{"text":"This was a special pit stop request from my teenage son. With a meal clocking in around 1200 calories with loaded fat and salt, my aging body can't afford many meals like this one. Having said that, my son absolutely loved it. He said the chicken strips were melt in your mouth goodness. The crinkle cut fries were absolutely amazing. The Texas toast was very buttery and soft. He wants to go back sometime but I'm lucky we don't live nearby.   I noticed many reviewers complained about the drinks. My son couldn't taste the difference in his fountain drink. Enjoy if you can!"}
{"text":"YOUr Drive through is SLOW like crazy SlOW.... SLOOOOOOW I am typing this whole waiting on your drive through mane and it's not moving. Your food is great get the line moving there are about 10 cars behind me and 4 in front barely moving."}
{"text":"dad and I went in for lunch today, but my dad had his In n out shirt on. The store manager came over and cleaned him up a bit! They gave him a raising canes commemorative t-shirt."}
{"text":"First time here- wow was I surprised.  The chicken was really good and the team provided excellent customer service!   So so good!"}
{"text":"For fast food chicken fingers, pretty good. They don't beat around the bush, they're like \"We think we have a few things down - chicken fingers, a sauce, ridged fries, slaw, toast, and sweet tea - and we're going to do those well, and if you don't like it, go somewhere else!\"  I liked it, had it a few times, consistent, solid fast food meal."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast delicious fried food, this is the place. The chicken fingers are crispy and delicious. The fries are salted just right and crunchy. The texas toast is buttered just right, and the coleslaw is crisp and creamy. Their menu is very simple and even without the variety it's still great. Luckily, California will be getting some Raising Cane's in a year or so."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food only. I will never come here during lunch time again. Way too busy and it takes a long time to get the food, took pretty much my whole lunch hour. I'll come back during slower times though."}
{"text":"New location right down the road from home. Always very fresh and hot food. It can get pretty busy but the staff does a really good job of moving things along as quick as possible."}
{"text":"- Very limited menu but in a good way - food quality is not what you would expect at a fast food   restaurant, it was very good - the employees are nice but a little too excited for your average customer, they take customer service very serious!"}
{"text":"Good fast chicken strips. These aren't your usual strips breaded or battered and friend. These are chunks of chicken that are made to fast food chicken strip perfection. You do have to pay for the Canes sauce, they cost 0.30 each but they go well with the good so just assume them as part of the cost!"}
{"text":"This location is just as good as the others. If you go during lunch time make sure do go inside because the drive thru will wrap all the around the building. There was only one person in front of me when we walked in. Place is very clean. For you parents, the high chairs are the ones I don't like where the wheels don't lock on the bottom (cafe zupas has the same ones) but, they were very clean. Most places always forget to clean their high chairs and we end up having to do it ourselfs. While we were eating we saw at least 2 employees constantly cleaning and picking up after people. Will def come back."}
{"text":"Good service , yummy chicken . Love their Texas toast . Not very like  with their hot sauce though, it just not spicy enough for me."}
{"text":"This place is new. The food is good, the lemonade is delish and the customer service is actually awesome! I like this place."}
{"text":"I love this location and come here at least once a week. The chicken is always good and they're very professional. Tonight, however, I went through the drive thru and ordered a three finger combo, but when I got home I noticed that there was no sauce with my meal. It's a small error, but if a place is known for something on their menu, it should definitely be included when it's ordered"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best tenders ever, they are always juicy and fresh and the dipping sauce is amazing and the toast is always soft on the inside and a nice crisp on the outside. Big fan of Raising Cane's, even did a road trip to New Orleans from Los Angeles and ended up hitting every Raising Cane on the drive just because the food is that awesome."}
{"text":"I can't help but compare and when it comes to chicken strips/ sandwiches chick fil a is the standard.. Here's how my comparisons went in an a vs b type showdown:    Chicken- Canes  Sauces- CFA Signature Sauce- Canes Sides- CFA Drinks- draw  Price- draw Menu- CFA   So yeah, the chicken and canes sauce is pretty good, I give it a slight edge.    It seems close but when you ask for BBQ sauce for your chicken strips and get met with the response of \"we don't have BBQ sauce, we're better than that.\", that kinda peeved me. Canes is good but for the same price and a ton of different sauces to go with my copious variations of fried chicken and much friendlier employees, It'll be my pleasure to head to CFA instead.   Also, I ask myself \"what would I get from Canes for breakfast?\"  Not chicken minis, or a chicken biscuit, or anything sadly."}
{"text":"My son is a fan of Cane's and that is where we found about this place.  If you want chicken this is a place you can get chicken fingers. I know most think of chicken fingers as ground up chicken molded to look like a bar. Here is is white meat chicken pulled put if batter and fried.  Chicken is the only thing you can get beside the sides that are available.  There is a secret menu. I don't know how extensive it may be but I know if you don't want the batter on the chicken you can order it \"naked\". Since I am on a no carb diet that is how i eat it.  Have been there two times and will go back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I really like the chicken strips at Raising Canes but this one seems to be not as good as others.  The strips this time weren't as hot and fresh, neither the fries.  This place is very busy and popular, for good reasons."}
{"text":"They messed up my order & on top of that they still haven't brought my order , it's been 30 minutes now , I had to go up & ask for it & they had forgot about my order. Worst costumer service ever. And when they did bring my order this is what I got."}
