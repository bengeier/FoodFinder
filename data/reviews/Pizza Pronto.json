{"text":"Very good pizza. Its not the best pizza I've ever had, but its good for Oakland fare. I've had a few pizzas from here; all were good. I've had the steak hoagie. It was good, but could've used some more flavor. The wings are the best I've had in Oakland. I got them once with the BBQ sauce. They were meaty and crispy."}
{"text":"Pizza Pronto has an extremely misleading name. I am giving a good review but it's not due to the pizza, which I think is honestly sub par. I like the Gyros, but I have seen them underpreform as well. What pizza pronto does extremely well is any thick pasta dish. If it involves cheese, sause and pasta, the chances are that pizza pronto does it exceedingly well. Their \"Classic Meat Lasanga\" was fanatastic but sadly they stopped making it. Give it a try, it's not very expensive."}
{"text":"We've ordered from Pizza Pronto quite a few times and have never had a bad meal. If you're looking for good, hard-to-find taco pizza, theirs is legit. They have a diverse selection of wings, which have always been flavorful and cooked just right.   You can't beat their pasta dinners--I ordered stuffed shells and they came with a small salad and garlic bread as well. The shells were delicious and tasted homemade. Gyros are huge and taste authentic.  Recently I decided to try the roasted eggplant pizza and it did not disappoint. The eggplant was rich and succulent and it's perfect as a white pizza.   I've always had great service from drivers and on the phone and the food usually arrives in less than 45 minutes. Sorry, but if you're ordering from a pizza place on a Saturday night waiting over an hour for delivery is not uncommon.  I think it's funny that other reviewers think that fries and jalapeno poppers are going to be crispy when delivered. Duh, there's nothing they can do about them getting soggy when they're packed up. Fried stuff never travels well and should be eaten immediately.  I'm very critical when it comes to food and I give Pizza Pronto an A++!"}
{"text":"My wife and I occasionally order from Pizza Pronto, but we've learned to only order the gyro.  There are much better places in Pittsburgh to order a pizza, but Pizza Pronto's gyro sandwiches are clearly made from freshly-sliced gyro meat, unlike the frozen/pre-cooked stuff you get at some other gyro joints, and they taste awesome.  Pizza Pronto also has a pretty big delivery area, so that definitely works in its favor, too."}
{"text":"More like Pizza not Pronto. Took an hour and 20 minutes to be delivered and it was cold."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place for our Sunday Steelers party. We ordered pizza and wings specials. The pizza was great and the wings sauce that we tried was amazing. We will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Cheese is perfect sauce is great, crust is amazing. I order from here quite a bit and I have never been disappointed it's always nice and warm when it comes. Super fast service and nice people working there!"}
{"text":"Definitely not impressed with this place, like the rating says, \"Meh.\"  My coworkers rave about this place and are constantly trying to convince me to try it, well one day I caved and decided to place an order.  The one good thing, and maybe the only good thing, is the speed at which you receive your food.  From the time we ordered until the delivery arrived, it was a fraction of what other places in Oakland will quote you.  This however makes you wonder just how the food is prepared.  If it will come that quick it makes you think that the food has been prepared prior to your order and has been sitting under heating lamps.    Speaking of the food, I decided to order the chicken strips and fries.  I am not sure if this is an accurate description of the food, but the chicken strips were airy.  I am not sure how that happens, but it felt as if there was a ton of air once you bit into the strip.  Weird.  As for the fries, generic and frozen.  Lackluster can best describe my food and is one of the causes as to me not ordering from here again.  Another being the fact that the prices are a bit steep.  Compared to other pizza places that deliver in the area you would think competition would be in full effect here.  Nope.  Who charges $10 for dips?  Unless you are creating every single ingredient in house, I doubt that you spinach artichoke dip is worth $10."}
{"text":"The pizza has too much cheese, is too greasy, and is not great. The gyro is average to good. The burgers were surprisingly good for a pizza delivery place. Better than a lot of delivery pizza in the area, but nothing special."}
{"text":"If you're like me and think pizza never has enough cheese on it, then Pizza Pronto is going to be your new favorite pizza delivery place.  The dough style is American, and they have a fair selection of toppings.  I've only given them 3 stars because they did not deliver my complete order, but I'm looking forward to giving them another try to bump it up to 4 stars.  The pizza I got had feta and capicola, and it was really good.  The feta was plentiful and nice and salty, and the pizza has lasted me for days now!  They also serve hoagies, salads, pasta dinners, wings, burgers and calzones.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I don't review much, but I've made the mistake of ordering pizza from here twice. It was the worst. Seriously, folks, you can do better that Pizza Pronto. Treat Yo' Self and order from anywhere else."}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel nearby and randomly picked them.  I ordered a calzone and pizza, and their food is amazing.  The sauce is one of the best I have ever had.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: we ordered a pizza and a meatball hoagie from Pizza Pronto right after a more-strenuous-than-usual gym workout, so our taste buds may or may not have been skewed by hunger.    However.  Ermahgerd.   They delivered to us in Point Breeze, which I really appreciated (delivery radii seem to be pretty stingy around here!), and the pizza...Lordy.  We got a large pizza with extra sauce, along with pepperoni and sausage on one half (his) and sausage and mushrooms on the other half (mine).  The crust was absolutely delicious - kind of sweet, just the right crispy-to-soft ratio.  The sauce wasn't sweet enough for the fiancé, but I thought it was just perfect, and the sausage was very flavorful and crumbly.  I only had one bite of the meatball hoagie, but I liked what I tasted, and the fiancé said it was \"fantastic.\"  These guys are our new go-to place since Vocelli finally wised up that we technically aren't in their delivery radius anymore.  Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"The delivery driver was great and they followed instructions. However, the food was terrible. The fries are cold and soggy. The gyro tasted like it wasn't fresh. The jalapeño poppers were just not good. Nothing tasted like it should have. Nothing tasted much like anything at all, really. It was just not very good."}
{"text":"This is my go-to gyro and hummus place!! The pizza in my opinion is super wack, but the gyro and hummus platter are absolutely delicious, filling, and worth every penny!!   The delivery speed of this place consistently lives up to its name because I've never had to wait more than 35 minutes for my order to be complete. One random night, a curious me decided to go for the Buffalo chicken dip. It was easily the best random appetizer choice I've made in a very long time. It was everything you want out of BCD and then some! You only want to order this about once or twice a year because the portion size is huge and addicting, but I promise it lives up to the hype!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this pizza shop for about 10 years now. Amazing that it's still there!! That should say something. I live in Lawrenceville, but the pizza always gets to us quick and hot. My favorite pizza is the Ranch Delight. It's awesome!! Even if you don't like specialty pizzas (like me), you will love it. I admit they SOMETIMES put a touch too much ranch on it, but most of the time (85%) they make it perfect! I have been ordering from here so long, I would probably be more likely to notice that kind of thing.  I also love their pasta! They make it good, no pool of grease on top like some pizza places. I always get the stuffed shells or manicotti with sausage. I actually don't order pasta from anywhere else, they just make it right. Love the garlic bread, too. Price is right, delivery guys are nice and polite. No complaints!"}
{"text":"We use this place a lot for takeaway. My boyfriend LOVES their buffalo chicken dip!! It's priced just right too-$9.99 for a decent size tray. That's what it costs when I purchase ingredients to make it myself...only mine doesn't taste half as good. When we have parties, we like to order a tray or two to put out with other snacks and it's always a big hit. Everything on the menu is really good from hummus to pizza and hoagies. Delivery really is fast; pronto even. The drivers are super sweet too! PS: I'd take a picture but we've inhaled the food too quickly."}
