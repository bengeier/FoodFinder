{"text":"Super yummy carnitas, extra friendly, fresh and clean.  I got a deal for 20 bucks of food for 10 on Amazon local.  Glad I did will become a regular spot."}
{"text":"Great service.  Got here during their happy hour. Margaritas on the rocks for just $3 and they were good. Food was cheap but full of flavor.  Owner was very friendly and so was staff. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Great food the huaraches were delicious and margaritas are really good plus they offer a great variety of food."}
{"text":"We order lunch here a lot. Its always good. Lots of food. No complaints there. One night I decided to pop in and see what this place was about. It's a cool spot.   The restaurant side is totally sealed off from the bar & pool table so smokers won't interfere with your meal. It has its own entrance from the street so you can bypass this altogether if you want.   The bar side is a bit dark. Decent sized bar.  Refrigerators the size of the wall clearly display the various bottled beers they serve.  If I didn't live across town I would actually hang out here. Its a cool joint, good food. Fun place to come to after work & chill. Definitely a locals spot. Everyone is friendly. Doesn't get better than that in my book."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Very good food with a few different sauces for customizing your plate.  I recommend the chicken quesadilla. They recently revamped the menu and now its even better than before."}
{"text":"The best food I've ever had while in vacations. The server was very kind and she made me feel like i was home. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Bomb food real authentic Mexican food. No added flavor salsa on point.. really delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great food great prices, pool table and bar area connected but separate from retaruant. Will return"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Garnacha's. I'm used to great Mexican food & have been in Vegas for just about 3 years now. I've been to many places here & have finally found the best in town. Their street tacos are amazing & today I had a carnitas torta (BEST I'VE EVER HAD). They have a fresh salsa & chips bar with at least 5 different home made salsas, they too are extremely tasty. It's hard to pick which one you like better. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is in search of GREAT Mexican food."}
{"text":"Found out about this place on groupon so we decided to give it a try. Everything is freshly made right in front of you. I had the pollo asado bowl and was able to choose what I want added into it, my husband had the 3 taco combo and chose 3 different meats and completely enjoyed himself. Oh and the best part, a fresh made salsa bar with chips. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First Yelp review....hopefully this inspires the whole city to try this new taco spot!  Garnachas just opened, and that is apparent in how clean and organized this place is.  They have a bar and a restaurant which is cool, a cold Dos Equis and tacos is always close to perfect.  Along with a perfect location on Valley View in between Sahara and Desert Inn, this place is destined for success.   So I walk in the bar entrance and was immediately greeted by the owner.  Dude was cool without putting on his \"welcome new customer\" spiel.  He shows me the menu board and explains my options. I decide to get 4 different tacos (pastor, carnitas, chicken and braised beef\") along with rice and beans.  Bottled Coke is an automatic! Garnachas does the line different than El Gordo or Taco Y Taco.... Its more assembly line which allows you to \"build your own\" on top of your taco. Service was fast and friendly.  All of the tacos were hot and moist and had a ton of flavor.  Topped with Jalapeño salsa, i could've eaten more than the 4 but I showed restraint.  The only thing I would change would be the rice, it was kinda of plain and just hasn't as good as it should be.  The owner thanked me for the comment and said was going to have 2 different kinds of upgraded rice very soon.    4 tacos, rice and beans and a bottled Coke was $12 bucks.  Leaving full and satisfied.  Free chips and salsa bar is also a nice touch.  Keep up the good work, I will be a regular for sure!!!"}
{"text":"As a lover of street tacos in LA, it was a treat to discover this addition to the culinary landscape in Vegas!  Our taco assortment had generous portions of fresh ingredients that were delicious.  Service was prompt and the wait staff were courteous and attentive.  Although our trips to Vegas are infrequent, I will definitely visit again.  And I would encourage \"locals\" to take advantage of a neighborhood restaurant that offers great food at affordable prices in a clean and festive environment.  Good luck to the business and thanks for helping make the trip extra special!"}
{"text":"Good stuff!  Came here on Sunday at 3:45 pm. It was slow and the service was a little. But everything was delicious. Carne asada fries and a carnita bowl. Great sized beers for the money and a darn good bloody Mary. I would recommend. ;)"}
{"text":"Great service!! Food was delicious! Would definitely eat here again. Mangers were awesome, he explained the entire menu and not once did I feel as if he was rushing me. Their food is made to order, so there will be a bit of a wait, but you won't be disappointed. The panbazo was awesome!!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE service, threw in tons of free food food like guac and chips and really helpful picking something good. Great specials on Tuesday and Thursday too. As for the food...it's always the hidden gems that impress. Seriously try out this place"}
{"text":"We wanted to eat off the strip and we found this place on yelp.. This place is amazing the food is so good and the service is great!! Taste just as good as my mommy's food ... Thank u yelp for recommending this place"}
{"text":"Delicious you have to try the Al Pastor tacos, the meat is marinated so well you have to order it. The spiciest salsa made with habanero was a perfect pairing with the Al Pastor tacos. Small little place great customer service."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the casual atmosphere and fair prices, the food here is soooo good! The girl who helped us was really nice and patient, as I probably asked her about everything on the menu before deciding on carne asada tacos. They were really delicious, and I loved the chips and salsa bar. This was some of the best Mexican food that I have ever had, and other places at the same price point do not even compare To Garnachas. I wish that we had one of these where I live, because I would be eating here on a weekly basis if that were the case. Local people are lucky to have a gem like Garnachas. I will make sure to visit every time I'm visiting in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food and prices but only one tortilla for the street tacos."}
{"text":"The food is good and they have awesome deals. I will definitely be coming back. There is a little bar in the back, you can't beat the $ 2 beers. Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago where it seems like their is a Mexican joint on every corner and finding in my travels that the worst of Chicago is the best elsewhere; I was pleasantly surprised to find this Gem. The menu was your basic taco, burrito, and torta place with a little bar in the back. The service was top notch maybe because it was slow on a Sunday afternoon never the less 10 stars for that. The staff went as far as making us stuff not on the menu it was 12pm and we wanted breakfast. They inquired on what we might like to eat and 10 min later in front of me sat a dish not on the menu. You can't beat service like this. Thanks again will definitely visit next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Got a torta with al pastor,  and a couple of tacos.  Delicious.  The torta was super tasty and the tacos were small but filled with meat.  Plus they cooked everything fresh.  Took a while, especially when they had to do different meats for each taco.   Very friendly and fresh and tasty.  Will definitely return.  As for the guy complaining about the service... I'm a little confused.  The place is clearly the kind of restaurant where you order at the counter and take your food back to the seating area, not a waitress table service place. This seems pretty obvious and clear, so if you sit down and wait for service you might be a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I am giving this 5 stars because the service is excellent, they go above and beyond, they provide excellent Mexican food. Price is decent considering the quantity and quality of the food. Lunch specials are pretty good too as far as price goes. Always love coming here for a Mexican food craving during the work week!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty darn good. I've been here a few times & my all time favorite dishes are the Carne Asada Nachos & the Tacos de Carne Asada. Now, I'm Latina & I'm VERY picky when it comes to Mexican food because, of course, NOTHING tops my mothers cooking...BUT, Garnachas came pretty close. The service here is really good as well. Its fast, efficient & they are so friendly. I also HIGHLY recommend the Michelada's!! They are MUY BUENAS!! Anyways, the food is great, the menu has a very good variety to choose from & its very affordable. Also, if you do happen to come in take a peak at the bar area, they play good music, they have a pool table & the bartenders are the sweetest girls ever. Really good service on both sides. I have yet to try the Al Pastor tacos, but I've heard great things =) i'll definitely be stopping by again sooner than later."}
{"text":"We didn't know what to expect so we got burrritos: Carne asade and el pastor. Plus the three combo plate: enchilada, Chile relleno, and taco. Overall food was delicious, quick and affordable. Close to the strip if you have your own car.   These types of small good eats spots are what cities like vegas need.   Also has a bar and a pool table room connected so if want to have a chill low key night, there it is."}
{"text":"after reading the reviews my family and I decided to give it a try. Wrong idea. there was a change of ownership and the food was not so good. most of the stuffs were dried and the salsa was horrible. what a big mistake. 4dollar for a corona. are you kidding me. never again. yuck."}
{"text":"Ordered a \"pambazo\" with their delicious al pastor and it was so good. The people there were very friendly and a man even helped us choose what to order since it was our first time. Their carne asada wet burrito is very good as well. Fries that came with my pambazo weren't so great, sub for chips if possible."}
{"text":"Came here for their grand opening last week and to put it nicely, I was disappointed. I arrived at 6:30 and even though the place was busy, I managed to find a table for me and my friends by the entrance. Half an hour later and the waitress STILL hasn't noticed me, so I start texting my friends (who hadn't arrived yet), telling them about the horrible service. It's not as if she's been neglecting the other customers either; twenty minutes after I got into the place, a group of four guys sat down and got served right away. Anyway, sometime later, my friend orders a beer and that too takes a while. We decide to bounce and ask for the check. Again, a long ass wait. My friend turns to me and says, \"Now I see what you were bitching about before. The service sucks here.\" The place gets one star for the grand opening special of $2 draft beer, but other than that, I probably won't go back..."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Came from out of town and tried it out. This place has great reviews for a reason. Owner was nice and accommodating as well. Combo's are cheap and ladies get free margaritas on the weekends from 8-12."}
{"text":"This place has really good food - I came and ordered 2 lunch specials...one beef burrito and a chicken for my man. The lady behind the counter was so sweet, she let me have a fountain drink even though the lunch special only included a canned soda or bottled water. At first, I got the piña and the first sip I took I almost spit it out. I asked her if I could get something else as there was nowhere for me to dump the liquid (I don't throw liquid in the trash) and she handed me another cup and also complained she didn't like the piña. Lol.  The food took a few minutes and I took it to-go so I didn't check it before I left. When I got back to work and opened the container I was kinda disappointed that it was more of a \"wet burrito\" style which I'm not too crazy about. Well as soon as I took my first bite I was in love lol. The meat was sooo tender and juicy, good flavor, not too salty. I just wish it was a bit bigger. I'm definitely going to come back and try other items. They have decent prices too!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! Make sure to try the al pastor and enjoy a Mexican coke! This is worth the gas to drive across town for me and the service is amazing!!! I will be back definitely!"}
{"text":"Walking around the Las Vegas Strip can be exhausting if you're not into big crowds, long waits, above average prices for average food.  This place was the oasis in the desert my wife and I were yearning for. The service is friendly and prompt.  The menu is extensive and affordable.  My wife got the steak tacos and a side of guacamole.  I opted for the quesadilla with shredded beef. My challenges with this place is that my quesadilla was so greasy that even with going out of my way to keep it from staining my clothes (and face) I was unsuccessful. I also saw no sign of the promised roasted green peppers in line juice. I'll go back if I'm in the neighborhood but I'll be choosing something else."}
{"text":"So delicious! I ordered the torta and it was way better than any other torta I had tried. My boyfriend ordered the garnacha fries and he loved them! We will definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"Super clean inside. Great selection. Reasonable prices. Fresh made and fast. Nice staff. Either eat in our take out. Would come here again when back in Vegas. Only a few minutes of the strip. The wet carne asada burrito was fantastic."}
{"text":"They close their restaurant. Por que?  I loved going here for lunch. Now they are closed and there are no other good and cheap taco spots around"}
{"text":"EVERY time I have come here, the people have been super nice and welcoming. They have offered me samples and told me what everything is and how to eat it the best way.   I have been here probably 4 times in a 30 day span and I am never disappointed. I tried a torta for the first time and I came back with friends to have the delicious taste of what makes this place the perfect Mexican late night food stop.   Oh, btw they have $1 tacos from 8-10pm and if you check in on FB you can get a free drink on the bar side or the food side.   Definitely somewhere to stop by when you're in the mood for some delicious, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great little out of the way place. We stayed at the convention center and it was only a short drive. Dishes had huge portions and were delicious. The staff is super friendly and I'd go here again for a quick taco/burrito anytime!"}
{"text":"The meat in my torta carne asada was dry. chewy, tough to eat and very salty. The fries that come with it were good- hot and crispy.  My companion had the Chile relleno & green chicken enchilada which was pretty good. The side of refried beans is salty, the rice is dry, and tasted like it's been sitting in the counter the whole day. Maybe it was late when we came (we went at 5:30PM) or the cook was having a bad day but this visit was not a very good experience. I'm giving it 3 stars since the server is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Very plain and average mexican food......shredded beef seems like it was london broil shredded by hand......very poor execution in a proper braise. Burrito filling was drowning in some kind of tomato sauce which made the filling look unappetizing. There were many execution issues with my meal....the flavors were ok, i just feel the chef needs to learn better techniques"}
{"text":"The food is great here I love there tortas with suadero there salas verdes pork and carne asada taco are good too. They give you a side of chips and salsa on the side of your to go orders or in you eat in. They have great customer service. I will keep on coming back."}
{"text":"The most amazing tacos and burritos I have ever had. They make it right in front of you and all of the ingredients taste amazingly fresh! Low cost (got three tacos, a burrito and two drinks, $15. Hard to find, but worth it when you do!"}
{"text":"We could not determine where best to park or even if the restaurant was open so we entered via the adjoining/connecting Chi'Chica'Ron Sports Bar.  The restaurant was not busy on the Sunday afternoon of our visit, but we did witness a few people coming in for takeout orders.  After reviewing the menu, we placed an order for (1) chicken and (3) al pastor street tacos at the counter.  Taco chips and 2 fiery salsas were brought to our table while we waited. The tacos came with lettuce, guacamole, salsa, and cilantro.  These were pretty good, but with several more conveniently located restaurants serving better fare, this will likely be our last visit."}
{"text":"This is my second review of this place. I've never given two reviews before but this is my third time here. (It's not close to my house unfortunately - but when I'm in the area I come here) tacked are so good and the salsa they give with the chips are awesome. The green is my favorite but I love the heat of the red too!! And it's so clean and they are so nice! Love this place! If you like tacos you should come eat them here - and 2 for $5?!?!? I mean \"what?\" That just can't be beat!!!"}
{"text":"So i was driving down the street saw this place and decided to try it. First impression...VERY clean and well maintained. Very friendly and welcoming staff. This is probably the cleanest mexican restaurant i have ever been to. I ordered the carne asada burrito. Was solid ,nice pieces of meat i added my gringo guacamole and cheese. The only reason im not giving them a 5 is because the rice was bad. I hate when im trying to eat and i have to be careful i don't break a tooth on a stale piece of rice. If the rice had been fresh this would have been a 5. I will give them a pass on this as it was about 4 pm and i think they just didnt realize that it needed to be made again. I mentioned it to the lady and she was very professional and apologetic. I will definetly be back I am sure the rice was a miscue that rarely happens."}
{"text":"Cinco de mayo and here we ended up for some Mexican food.  Great food, great service, owner was on duty and super friendly.    This place has only been open a short while...stop in and enjoy a great meal.  (Keep them open so I can return on my next trip lol)  For cinco de mayo the specials were buy one get one beer and buy get one tacos...  So I ordered one of each taco of course! (And got two of each!)  Street tacos and they were delicious..my favorite was the pastor tacos...amazing...  Also order tonight was a combo green chile burrito/green chicken enchilada....flavor was great and plate nearly licked clean.    Muy Bueno !"}
{"text":"This place has the best Guacamole I have ever had. The owner was very kind and gave us good advice on what to eat. The food was done freshly and was very delicious! Great place I would go there again anytime!"}
{"text":"After having a long night in Vegas we were craving a warm Menudo the next day. I found this little whole in the wall on yelp, and let me tell you it was just what i was craving. Its a very small restaurant but the food was delicious, prices were very reasonable. For all of you that are looking for a good Menudo after a long night in Vegas this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place sucks.  My family of 4 waiting forever for wack food. We were the only people in the joint! They charged $4.50 for side beans and rice. (Not a full portion) pathetic. Food is a joke. All the 5 stars are liars or don't know what's up."}
{"text":"Don't overlook this place. I had the wet green chile burrito (has pork) and it was delicious. Served with chips and 2 sauces, fresh and tangy. That really hit the spot. Friendly staff and clean simple decor. Definitely worth a visit. No te lo pierdas!"}
{"text":"1st time visit using a Groupon and i must say it was delicious.. I couldnt stop eating till it was all gone. I got the Garnachos Nachos with carne asada and it was the best nachos besides the ones i fix at home. My friend got a torta and couldnt even finish the whole thing, she loved it. We both will be back and i cant wait to try the $1 tacos!! YEP I am a fan."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for a late lunch after reading all the great reviews, and now I have too add my own.  We had the chicken enchiladas, al pastor huarache, and a chile relleno.  All of it was excellent.  Great green sauce on the al pastor huarache and enchiladas.  Want to go back and try the pambazo.  The gentleman working behind the counter was very friendly and answered our questions about the different dishes.  Restaurant was spotless.  Will definitely we going back again to try some new dishes."}
