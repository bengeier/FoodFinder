{"text":"Salads are always great here& wings but their customer service sucks!!!! FIRE & HIRE A NEW STAFF"}
{"text":"We arrived and there were about 8 tables that were dirty and hadn't been bussed which is never a good sign. It usually means that the service will be slow and that they are understaffed. We sat ourself and about 7 minutes later the waitress arrived and didn't even introduce herself or say hello. She only said, \"What can I get you ?\" We ordered 4 waters which she brought about 5 minutes later. Come to find out the restaurant was extremely understaffed and she was the only waitress working. We walked up to the bar to see if they had any beers on tap, and they didn't just by observation. We couldn't ask a staff member because the bartender was on her personal cellphone and wouldn't even acknowledge us. Finally, we decided to leave prior to ordering and went next door to the Flip Side Cafe who sells locally farmed produce and all locally grown foods. It was amazing and the best decision we could have made. We will definitely go back to the Flip Side Cafe !!!!"}
{"text":"i used to like it here. until they messed up every to-go order i've placed. and getting flustered that i arrive earlier than expected to pick it up."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a rainy Friday. Order the lunch special two slices of specialty pizza and a drink for $4.95. the pizza came out fast and delicious. I can really tell that it was fresh and homemade. Our waitress Taylor was very attentive to our needs even though it was lunch rush hour. When asked about the pizza Taylor told us that they make their own dough daily. If you're in the neighborhood stop by carmellas and try a little Slice of Heaven."}
{"text":"chicken philly and chicken wings!! $1 slices and beers also for the win."}
{"text":"Their pizza is what I have been looking for ever since moving to NC from PA.  Its the really good thin floppy fold it up and eat it kind of pizza.  The atmosphere reminds me so much of small little italian pizzerias that run throughout Philly and NJ.  Wonderful food. We got there about 11:40 for lunch and by noon there was quite a line and most of the tables were filled.  Go a little early and have your pick of tables."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a fast lunch. The pizza is average, but their speed is good. However, on multiple occasions on the weekend I've had piss poor service on multiple trips. I'll spend my hard earned money elsewhere on the weekends."}
{"text":"My review of Carmellas has to fall somewhere in the middle of all the other Yelpers' experiences.  My family and I regularly go here before going to Charlotte Knights games.  There's nothing like a thin, greasy, slice of New York inspired pizza.  The pizza has always been good.  The cleanliness...not so much.  I am also thrown off by the sometimes \"sketchy\" service.  It never seems to be the same...and the servers sometimes appear \"on edge\".  

Overall, it's not a bad experience...or...should I say...it hasn't been yet.  I usually order a pepperoni pizza...and will do my best to never order a topping that remotely sounds like the word \"hair\"."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in town. Always get delivery. Alway comes perfect. Also like the wings. Never have had anything bad or wrong.  Cheese pizza is great. Love there white pizza. Pasta dishes are great too."}
{"text":"Wings were great...they were a bit on the greasy side but crispy and spicy! Had large supreme Pizza and it was great as well. We stopped here based on the reviews and almost turned around...we weren't  expecting that but it was awesome!"}
{"text":"It's not the fanciest place you ever go to, but it's not supposed to be, it's a nice laid-back bar with good pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Don't bother calling for carry out they more than likely put you on hold for 15+ minutes only reason my call didn't run lingers is they hung up on me while still on hold.  After calling back and finally getting someone to take my order I was already in the parking lot by this point I walked to to pay after explaining my situation to the rather unconcerned girl at the register and stating I'd be happy to pay 1 dollar a minute less for the pizza that should have already been done a waiting for me had they actually taken the 2 minutes or less to take my
Order on the initial call, she turns a directs my request too a very uncaring supervisor who informs me that since the order was already placed he couldn't give me a discount which is complete crap.  This is t the 
1st time I've had issues with them placing me on hold and forgetting to pick the call back up usually I'd just call hang up and call back after a few minutes to actually place my order this time I was curious to see who long it would take them to answer and I got my answer if they place you on hold they flat out won't pick it back up they'll just hang up on you after 15 minutes or so.    


There are far better pizza options fairly close by and i'm including chain pizza places in this mix which I generally avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for there fair prices for pizza and the games they have; however the people at the bars during any game are always obnoxious, the pizza is way too greasy, and the service is ok but is pretty awful anytime past 10pm."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible on every level. Needs to be negative a star and fiercely avoided!!!

Waitress did one water refill, no sodas or beer. Both subs containing chicken tasted like it was frozen slices that were microwaved...had that distinct taste. Gyro sauce tasted like mayo.  Three large parties sat after us and after 45 min we were served, those 3 had eaten with two paying their bill to leave. Our 3 subs came out and I had to go to the kitchen counter to find our 1 small pep pizza. 1 hour for a pizza. And it was NOT anything like NY pizza. They forgot a main entree of my parents and graciously took it off the bill. First and last time there. You can't blame the kitchen for everything. As waitstaff you gotta know what order your tables are in and when your table is missing food for over 15-20 min. Terrible terrible terrible. 90 min wasted on crap service and food."}
{"text":"I love this place. For those who don't know the pizza here holds it own with any pizza around Charlotte, IMO. Here's the deal people this is a local joint with usually the same regular patrons who all know each other and are like a family. The drinks are cheap the pie is great and the people are awesome. It is not a gourment pizza place it is a local bar with good pizza pie. The crowds vary at times to almost crazy some nights but that is what makes it fun. I can totally understand how someone may not like it but that is because they don't understand what the place is about. Hang out, meet some people at the bar and throw some darts. When you get hungry order 2 slices of pepperoni. Great place for me it is laid back and fun. You run into some local people and take it for what you want. Definetely not a corporate uptight boring place."}
{"text":"Won't be back! 

We ordered a large thin crust x cheese pizza. 

It was decent tasting, but so greasy it drips off your pizza.  Going on the second slice, my friend bites into a stick. The stick didn't even break, and luckily my friends teeth didn't either. The waitress, bar tender took it to the back to ask the chef. He responded it's from the oregano. 

This place at the least should buy a higher quality of oregano or grind it before it goes on a pizza. Had either one of us had a dental issue, this would have been seriously bad!!"}
{"text":"Greasy, not very good cheese pizza! How disappointing!!

We ordered a 14\" Cheese pizza. Light sauce and extra cheese. It came so greasy that it completely soaked up several napkins. There was no redeeming anything about the pizza. The cheese, the sauce, the seasoning, the crust.. Only blah!  I also had a hard sick in my pizza. I'm going to guess it was oregano. In my opinion, if you're going to buy cheep seasonings, at least grind it up first. 

You can sit outside, but you have to order it inside and bring it out yourself. They have some kind of rule that they are trying to bypass to allow you to sit outside with food and drink, but only if you bring it out yourself, or they do in a to-go-box. So strange!!

Almost every other restaurant around them have outside seating and they bring it to you with no qualms."}
{"text":"Just left there and the food was great as usual. The bartender / server was drunk as shit and slow as shit. She spent more time drinking and pouring shots with friends or regulars. She had no clue what was going on. The music is way too loud, especially with only 10 people in the whole place."}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick bite. Lunch pizza combo is well priced. Pizza is delicious but I needed a fork to eat it (soggy).  Service is nice a and friendly.
Update:  returned to try their pasta on a Tuesday night.  Place was packed as the special was $1.00 for slice of pizza or  beer. Ordered the chicken parmigiana...bad, really bad.   C hicken was dry, thin and crispy  (could taste the oil) smothered in sauce with cheese, too long in the oven, tasted caramelized almost burnt. Could not eat it.  Service still very friendly but little stressful.  They gave our order to the wrong table, we had to wait for ours, it was too busy!   Probably will return for pizza, but not on a Tuesday night"}
{"text":"Large pizza for 5 beers for $20?! I'll be back. Pizza was good, place had a nice divey feel to it, definitely a great place to watch the panthers play this fall."}
{"text":"Bar tender didn't have a clue what was going on. Watched one customer walk out because she disappeared for ten minutes. Went to watch football game and the juke box was on. No worries can work around that. Except it was so loud you couldn't talk over it. Would not recommend anyone take your kids there while someone has control over the juke box. unless you leave them in the car and run in to grab your to go order. Never again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. Some of the staff there is okay. Food Is mediocre, place is poorly kept up, and their A/C never seems to be working. The manager, Kathy, is absolutely 100% unprofessional, she yells and cusses at her staff in front of the customers, talks down to everyone. Some of my regular servers express how mean and unprofessional she is. Surprised she has kept the staff she has for as long as she has considering the abuse they endure each and everyday. I enjoy Tuesday dollar pizza a beer night. The bar tender is great, but the manager really makes me rethink visiting there everytime I go. I myself have been a manager in the restaurant business and I do not approve of her managing technique and skills, or lack there of really. In my opinion this place would do triple the business of they found a better person to manage this place. My visits will continue to decline until someone with a brain fires this incompetent woman. Until then, find another place for pizza and beer like empire if you want to avoid drama and constant yelling from her big mouth."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood type Italian sports bar/pizza place. They have some affordable lunch specials - two slices and a drink for $4.95 or a slice and salad and a drink for $5.95. I would say the pizza is below average compared to NYC standards, especially since they tout its a NYC slice. The sauce was ok but the crust was a little too thick and not crispy. 
I only tagged along with coworkers, probably will not make a trip out here by myself."}
{"text":"I brought my family here on Thursday night, 50 cent wing night. We ordered some hot wings, they were pretty good. I like the flavor of the sauce, nothings better then a tasty hot sauce. My kids ordered the kids French bread pizza, it was a really large portion that they could have shared but it was so inexpensive I didn't mind. We ordered the vegetarian pizza, for me there was too much cheese but everyone loved it otherwise. I dunked mine in the wing sauce, delish. 
All in all we had a good experience, the bar area was packed but the dining room was slow. I was happy that it was a semi loud place so my kids weren't a bother :) that's always a plus when you have two kids under 4. 

Point is... we will def be back."}
{"text":"This place has a good rep, I just don't like it. The pizza is way too oily or greasy however you want to call it. Not for me. I hate any food that's covered in oil."}
{"text":"Love Carmella's pizza so we thought we'd try the new location on Montford. Unfortunately, the service was horrid. Three of us walked in on a slow Tuesday evening. The hostess told us to sit where we like (first bad sign). There were 5-6 other parties at separate tables. We saw one waitress at least three times pass by and were not acknowledged once. A group of four came in after us and were immediately given menus (we hadn't been given anything) and within a couple minutes were being waited on. We had been there almost 10 minutes by this point without any service. The bartender looked at us twice also(as he was serving drinks to the area we were in) without acknowledging us either. We got up to leave and suddenly he offered us menus but we were over it at this point. A simple acknowledgment and a statement that someone would be with us shortly would have went a long way. I don't know what the circumstances may have been going on to slow service, but not being told anything gives the impression that the establishment doesn't care. And that's not a good first impression to make."}
{"text":"You will never have business with the bartender/waitress outside yelling at somebody for parking at the backend of the parking lot at 2pm when NOBODY was at your restaurant except one truck saying your car would be towed when the sign was at the other end of the parking lot... maybe if she wasn't such a ***** you would actually need 20+ spots for parking!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza spot! They also have amazing salad, always fresh with veggies. However, the wait staff is horrible. Therefore, get your stuff to go! Better than paying a tip to someone who doesn't care about being there."}
{"text":"Should be 4 stars...food and service was fair to good.  Prices fair to good and great atmosphere.  Sat at the bar and happy as a peach.  A very young female employee (17 yr old high school girl) kept coming up and interrupting my friends and I.  Then when I asked her nicely to leave us alone (we are in our 40's and married getting away from the kids for the afternoon) she sat in the bar seat next to us and started to be obnoxious.  She then asked me to buy her a special 'Shirley Temple' from a specific bartender and she would leave us alone.  SUPER BIZARRE.  We complained to both bartenders and the response was 'yeah she is crazy just ignore her??? '. When I mentioned 'the special drink' they laughed.  Walked to Angry Ales and had the same perfect service we have had for years.  No hyper teenagers in our ears...  One last note; customer of this company for almost 15 years at the old 51 store."}
{"text":"This place was awful!!! We are from Orlando and we are camping up here. After driving all day we were starving and wanted something quick and easy. The service was SLOW. It took forever for my husband to get a beer. The pierogies tasted like the frozen ones I buy. We ordered those as an appetizer but it came out about a minute before the pizza. The pizza was undercooked and the meatballs on it were dry and over cooked. I saw a big piece of what looked like cheese but it turned out to be a big piece of raw dough!! Our waitress was not friendly at all. I am thinking we should have went next door to the Chinese place! It had better reviews anyway!!"}
{"text":"Carmella's is one of my favorite places to get cheap, great tasting food.  I like going on Tuesdays for the $1 big slice special and Wednesdays for $0.50 wings special!  Their marinara sauce and wings are my favorite in Charlotte!  They cook the flavor into the wings instead of just pouring it on top.  So good!!!  Their philly cheesesteak is pretty awesome as well!  They've got good beer specials too!  I'm proud to be a regular there.  My friends and I always feel good when we are welcomed back and the servers already know our drink orders :)"}
{"text":"I just can't give better than two stars which is  basement level below average.  Service was poor and the pizza . . . well, let's just say, nasty.  First clue?  The creeper conveyor belt cooking the pie . . . amateur.  Who sold them on this contraption for NY/Neapolitan style pizza?

Second?  Almost no red sauce.  Whaaat?  No sauce?  Third?  It seemed (although I could be wrong) that both garlic salt and dried oregano were sprinkled on the pie before baking.  No, no, no.  You burned it, dude.  A good sauce and great cheese does not require cheap, dried ingredients.  I wasted a crisp $20.

Sorry to say . . . go elsewhere."}
{"text":"What can go wrong with a \" To-Go\" order. Not crowded. Attended to quickly and order placed. Got my regular items:

Baked Spinach Footballs- spinach & feta triangles of phyllo. Always good! 

Mediterranean Pasta w/Shrimp- comes with side salad choice of Caesar or Greek. I find the left overs of this dish takes much better. 

This restaurant is located off 21 or Regent's Parkway depending on where you're traveling from. They do deliver for a charge and the orders are usually within promised time frame. The food is always packaged well & hot. I have had 1 mishap with my order which was rectified by the restaurant. Convenient location helps too. 

And Strawberry Cheesecake for dessert."}
{"text":"So I always heard Carmellas was a decent place that the locals in the regent park area frequented.  Kitchen was closed at the golf course so we stopped in.Opened the door and totally not what we were expecting.  MOP ante up blasting on the speakers and it was gangster. Effin awesome.  Though i started to suspect the food.  I mean MOP and italian food with a name like Carmellas can't clearly go together can they?  Well apparently the decently priced beer and the cheap Stromboli with decent gravy ( sauce) blew my socks off.  I left there fat, pockets still fat, and happy.  I will definitely swing in again"}
{"text":"We loved this place when  it first opened.  That was until one day I brought a pie home and as soon as I opened the box it had a big clump of dark hair on it (my hair is buzzed and not the same color).  It wasn't one hair, but a large clump.  I have since gone to other places in the same strip mall, and noticed \"C\" sanitation grades on the door of Carmella's on numerous occasions.  I would be careful about eating here.  At least check their grade before going:

{"text":"If you put a sign in the window that says \"world's best cheesesteak\" your Philly should at the very least be decent. Pizza was old, dry, and had no taste at all. We ordered carry out but it took at least 20 minutes to receive our food. Meanwhile we waited in the dinning area and should have taken a hint when we were the only people there. The music was so loud from the jukebox you couldn't even hear one another talk. On our way out it appeared that the place was getting ready to be hit up (not the best location area), so we quickly ran to our car and will never go back. This was actually the S. Tryon location -hopefully Ft. Milli is better."}
{"text":"We got the large pepperoni pizza, pepperoni calzone and hot wings. 
Pizza was good. We like stringy cheese but the crust definite could've been cooked a little longer. 
Calzone was good except for ll of the pepperoni seemed to be in a pile in one spot. Would've like like it spread out a bit more. 
Wings wet done just right. I like mine a little crispy and that they were. However I always think I'm eating an inferior product when there are broken bones. Wednesday special was 50¢ wings. 

Seat yourself...very casual. Bar hopping crowd in the bar. Video games in the center for kids and big kids. Then there is a dining area in the back. Good for any and all. 

High ceiling and beer signs/racing memorabilia. 

Beer specials on Wednesday night were $1.50 domestic bottles. 

We may return when we crave pizza and have to venture to sc for gas."}
{"text":"Tuesday night for $1 pizza and $1 beers!  They remember you at the bar, which is a plus!!  Friendly and comfortable atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place! The pizza is thin, crispy, cheesy and delicious. The specials are incredible everyday. If you are in the area try this place you will not be disappointed...:) Great"}
{"text":"So we were actually at another location today for lunch and the pizza looked so good we decided to give the FM location a shot since we live in the delivery area of that location.

The pizza was REALLY good but it would have been even better if it showed up HOT. It was a Saturday night so I give them a pass on the hr delivery time but next time we order it better be HOT!"}
{"text":"Not only do the have the BEST pizza in CLT, but I lost my phone while there and the entire staff stopped what they were doing to help me find it!!! Awesome food, awesome people!!!!"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst pizza I've ever had. NY style? I don't think so. We ate 2 slices and tossed it in the trash."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fun staff....good beer selection than most. My buddy and I love grabbing a quick lunch here when we can."}
{"text":"We have visited Carmellas several times in the past and this time we took in-laws and the kids. Great atmosphere and wonderful food as always. Meatball sandwich,  sausage sandwich,  fettuccine and of course the pizza was great.   Our server Taylor was excellent,  she was handling the entire restaurant herself and found the time to take care of us and was great with our kids."}
{"text":"Great pizza,  awesome beer specials.  especially on Tuesday.  A little pricey but it beets any pizza chain."}
{"text":"Had the pizza, pretty good but not the best. I couldn't tell from the outside if it was open. There was a guy there manager/owner that was speaking loudly and dropped the F bomb every other sentence. Maybe to add NY flare? Lol"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Friday night to try out some I ordered cheese pizza it was okay nothing impressive though. The staff is super friendly and nice . They also have a bar and had a great dj spinning some great songs! Will be sure to come back on Tuesday so that I can get cheese pizza for a dollar a slice"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today, we sat ourselves as the sign said to do, along with the rest of the lunch crowd.  After 15 minutes of waiting and no one even asked us about drinks or offered us a menu we chose to leave. During the 15 minute wait I had direct eye contact with two waitresses and neither appeared interested in taking our order. We also watched people who sat down after us get their menu's and order taken. All I can say is they lost our business and not quite sure how the other people were waiting that long while on lunch break. We saw just one order come out in 15 minutes and that was a salad."}
{"text":"I got food from here for the 1st time. The wait wasnt long and the food tasted good. I bought a pepperoni,  beef, and sausage pizza. The pizza crust was a little soggy when I got home and ate it, but it was good. The cheese sticks are great. Baked just right with the right amount of cheese; marinara sauce is just right with good seasoning. Will buy from here again."}
{"text":"To all of those negative reviewers: Stop expecting this place to be something that it's not. Not everything has to be a hipster/gastropub/artisanal/mixology/tapas/whatever bar. This is your quintessential low-price, neighborhood eatery. Carmella's is a great place for the average Joe to eat classic bar food and American-Greek/American-Italian at rock-bottom prices. That is their menu style and they do a great job in that genre. If you like basic thin-crust pizza + wings and beer, this place is for you. Tuesday nights they have pizza for a dollar per slice and Wednesday nights they have $0.50 wings. They have drink specials every weeknight. The \"Barbalo\" wing sauce is a mix of buffalo and barbecue sauces and pretty tasty. Our favorite server is Carly. She is very efficient and sweet. Carmella's is lucky to have her. If you go, please treat her well!"}
{"text":"I love this place on a Friday night HOWEVER when they get busy the bartenders/waitresses can't handle it. Don't ask about your food that u ordered at the same time as your friends or Stephanie will rudely remind how busy she is therefor making sure you know how unimportant you are to her. The DJ is fantastic and crowd is fun and diverse ...Stephanie is sometimes decent but come on days when she isn't overwhelmed!"}
{"text":"$1 slice nights on Tuesdays and 50 cent wings on Wednesdays! Carmella's is delish and cheap. Good beer specials too!!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best pizza in town next to Hawthornes. Yes it's greasy but that's why I like it. Great pizza and wings. Good beer specials."}
{"text":"Today, I can't give any stars. My wife, daughter, and myself enter around 4 for an early dinner. The wife orders a house stromboli,i order the ruben, and my daughter gets a couple slices of cheese pizza. In addition, the wife and I get salads.

I like my salad first, like most people. Well, it came out with the meal. Now, my food is going to get cold waiting on me to scarf down a salad. This was not an issue.

The wife's stromboli was sitting in a pool of grease. So much it was inedible. My daughter has to wipe the grease off her pizza. My ruben had no dressing. Everyone makes mistakes. I look for our waitress. She is nowhere to be found. Mind you, we are the only table in the restaurant. I decide to go to the counter and service myself. She ignores us. I have to make several more attempts to get assistance, and she continues to ignore us. In between, she fills the ice machine.

I head to the counter to get my check, speak with a manager, and post my bill. I want nothing free, I give feedback, positive and negative. We can't improve if we don't know.  No manager, just some guy helping out. Convenient. The hispanics in the kitchen are laughing, probably at my expense. All he says is sorry. I expected nothing less. Now we have to find the waitress to get my bill. She won't even give it to me. She hands it to the guy and spend off. Now he can't run the register. He goes to find someone else. After an additional 5 minute wait, I can pay and leave...never to return.

So I had to post one star, but it was not deserved or earned."}
{"text":"I stopped by last Friday for a quick lunch. It was very crowded but I found a table in the bar. The server brought a menu fairly soon and I ordered before she walked away. She brought my drink and salad quickly. But then it took 25 minutes for the two slices of pizza to come (at least 15 min after a person who arrived after me got his-I really don't like that.)

The salad came in a small clamshell container - your basic pre washed salad mix. The pizza slices (one veg and one cheese) had obviously sat for some time. The server was over extended and was having trouble multi tasking. I felt pretty invisible for a time."}
{"text":"Great place in fort mill to visit, have a few drinks and eat. 

Tuesdays it's $1 pizza and beer. Weekends are also fun! Karaoke on Fridays, and music on Saturdays. They also have a juke box for the patrons, it does cost $ but it's great to have the option to choose your own music."}
{"text":"We were on our way to the Knights game and Capt. Steve's for some reason was closed on a Sat. night (vacation maybe?).  We drove down a bit and I remember driving by Carmellas a few times.  My kids like pizza so here we are.

Upon walking in, it seems a bit sketchy.  Let me set the scene....you walk in and the Jukebox is playing WAY too loud, and the music is like \"house boomy type music\" you know, like I just stepped into BAR CHARLOTTE?  Alas, no pole or anything but you know what I mean.  There is a bar section on the left hand side and for a 5:30 on a Sat. evening, there were people drinking and carrying on like it was last call I was waiting for someone to call out over the PA \"If you sitting stand, if you're standing get the hell out\".  On the right was like a twilight zone....completely transformed and is a sit down section with families eating pizza.  We pass by a few arcade games, foosball table and sit down.

Their menu is quite diverse with everything you'd want to see pizza, specialty pizzas heros, pasta dishes, the works.  We ordered a white pizza and I had a calzone.  All were surprisingly good.  My little one who, frankly, doesn't eat hardly anything scarfed down 2 slices of pizza while this may not mean anything to you,  to me it means the pizza was spot on!  My calzone was typical chock full of ricotta, mozz, ham and mushroom.  Good flavor.  The food, like I said was good.

The service was very good.  Others have found it non existent but they must have fixed the issue or at least they did last night.  Our server was upbeat, helpful and was attentive without being overbearing.  Our food came out lightning quick and we were in and out within an hour which put us right on time for the game.

I can take or leave this place, the food was OK but there are better places in the area for similar food.  I think Carmellas needs to establish it's identity and stick to it.  All in all, it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"We usually LOVE this place! BUT tonight was absolutely terrible. The pizza we got to go was literally dripping with grease/oil AND it was doughy, undercooked and terrible. We had to pop it in the oven to finish cooking it. I had called the spanish manager who spoke broken english that informed me that sometimes the pizza is greasy...and that you've been using the same ingredient for 5 years.......so pretty much... not caring that a customer was unhappy about the togo order for monday night. Needless to say.......we didnt eat the whole order we got and probably won't be in the mood for carmellas pizza again."}
{"text":"pizza by the slice is great, and the chicken tenders were pretty tasty as well. we are from Jersey and this was pretty close to NY pizza which is hard to come by down here. nice atmosphere, lots of Tv's to watch sports while you eat. wait staff was pleasant and service was timely. we have gone back again since our first visit."}
{"text":"Please do not eat at this place, I'm scared of this food. The worst part is the service and the trashy, anti-family, anti-american atmosphere. Please stay away"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Carmella's to open their Montford location since Maverick Rock Taco shut down. I frequent the Tryon location because Del is a Heels fan and a great bartender. 

Montford Carmella's is everything I wanted it to be. Better location, younger staff, same great food. Once Roasting Company stopped serving food past 9pm most nights, there was a void to be filled for service industry people looking for good service and food after 10pm, and here it gets filled. 

Carly is refreshing, she remembers names and faces, and takes care of everyone. She is such a great addition to Montford. 

From eggplant parm to wings to slices on Tuesdays, Carmella's is a great addition to Montford and I can't wait to see it prosper and thrive in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Came by here for a bite and brew today. Great place. Super cheap, and a large menu. Basic Italian food and a good beer selection. I had the cheese sticks and waffle fries (Comn, who doesn't like waffle fries?!) and the wings. The wings were GOOD. Crispy and meaty, $8 for 10 wings. Had Labatt Blue as well so that's a plus. It's nothing fancy but a great spot to get some good cheap food and beers. 50 cent wings and $1.50 beers on Wednesday."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Ordered the Special, 2 slices and a drink. I sat down at 12:45. 5 minutes later my drink comes. At 12:05 the waitress apologizes for the delay and tells me my slices will be there soon. At 12:12 I left a dollar on the table for the drink and left. 2 slices of pizza can't be ready in 27 minutes?  Never again, no excuse. Poor management."}
{"text":"This bar is definitely the spot to go on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Steph the bartender is absolutely phenomenal. Lori is a great bartender as well. I've heard there is an awesome karaoke on Fridays as well that I have yet to make it to. $1 slices on tuesdays awesome pizza as well as $1 beers. Wednesdays $.50 wings awesome deal awesome service. Make sure you tip your bartenders as well as they earn their tips."}
{"text":"Before we ventured out to Scarowinds we stopped in for a quick bite. I thought the place itself was just fine. I didn't notice blaring music (it was 6pm on a Saturday evening), and there was a clear divide between the dining area and the bar- making it family friendly. The menu is huge - everything from burgers to pasta/pizza to gyros. I ordered the chicken parm which came with a salad and pasta on the side. 

I really enjoyed the salad - the ranch dressing was homemade and it had some nice pepper jack cheese sprinkled on top. As far as my main dish I found that their sauce was too sweet for my liking - and there wasn't a whole lot of chicken in the dish , it was mainly the \"side\" of pasta that came with it. The chicken itself was really good so I was dissapointed to find the side made up the bulk of my meal. I had a bite of the strombolli which was really delicious - so I'd stick with the pizza/calzone/strombolli route if I were to return.

Service was quick and friendly- no issues in that department. The only thing I found a little odd was that all of the containers including our  silverware, entree and salad dish were disposable .My mom's entree was in a to-go box that sat on top of a regular plate so I know they have dishwashers.  It seems like  they would save a lot of money by just getting rid of these when people dine-in...it also would be way better for the environment -as I cringe to think how much plastic they waste. 

Overall it was a solid choice to grab a quick inexpensive bite before heading to Carowinds."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place on Tuesday night!! I roll in there for $1 pizza & $1 beer. I usually spend $26 and get 2 pieces of pizza and a pretty good buzz. I'll be back next Tuesday just like every Tuesday night."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  Great pizza in South Carolina.  They have a 5.99 lunch special 2 slices and a soft drink.  Not only is it inexpensive the pizza taste really great.  Well seasoned."}
{"text":"Carmella's is pretty good for a lunch stop. I've been here at least three times, and counting, during my lunch hour. It's quite close and service moves quick enough for the allotted lunch hour that so many of us are limited to. They recently updated their menus to a large 11x17\" size front and back with thick, strong lamination - a much needed improvement. And they fill that menu top to bottom on both sides with lots of tasty options.

The food selection isn't especially unique, though perhaps it is harder to find. The salads with grilled chicken are usually piled high and they're not your everyday bland salads with just three toppings (iceberg, tomatoes and cheese). They actually give a healthy helping of mozzarella cheese, big slice of tomato, a banana pepper, a whole slice of green bell pepper, thinly sliced red onions, cucumbers and more (depending on which specific salad you order). I've seen co-workers order the meatball subs which are weighed down with giant meatballs and a pile of marinara. I recently had the black bean burger. Like a heathen I brought insult to vegans everywhere and had them add bacon. It was a seriously good sandwich considering the price of less than $9.

The service can be spotty here though. Out of the three times I can clearly remember visiting this restaurant, twice I've had the wrong thing placed in front of me when it came out. And as I mentioned above it comes out quick enough for lunch hour but it can also push it a little close to the cut. Nonetheless, I will definitely be coming back several times for lunch!"}
{"text":"this is my absolute favorite pizza place in fort mill. none of the pizza places that have commercials have anything on this place. its always fresh and made to perfection. not to mention its only 5mins from my house, their customer service is great and they have a variety of different foods to choose from. plus its not expensive. kudos to them."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a bite and wait out the rain. Ordered the lunch special...one slice of pizza, side salad, and a drink. It came to the table quickly, was a nice size slice, was hot, and had good flavor. I like that they make their own dough. The best part was the price ($5.95) - can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"I was in search of a pizza to measure up to Iannuccis' Pizza in Asheville NC. I ve recently.moved to the Ft Mill SC area from AVL and was looking for  a good pizza restaurant. I went to the Iannuccis' website and built their house specialty pizza ingredient for ingredient and placed.the order at Carmellas. The Carmellas  pizza looked good but really lacked flavor. It was a good try but not a really good pizza.  I'm not.sure that I ll go back to Carmellas."}
{"text":"Use to love this place and visit at least twice per week... it's severely declined downhill and the quality of service and food shows it. I am guessing the ac doesn't work since they installed a \"Big Ass\" fan, which IMO, is not fun explaining to my child who is asking why it says ass... very inappropriate. but it gets so humid. I see servers standing and chatting while using menus to fan themselves looking unhappy. And a happy staff equals happy customers... 

Oh, and poker nights? Really??"}
{"text":"The food is bland but you can't beat the $1 a slice Tuesdays. Food I'd say is one star, service is 4 stars, and bar beverages are a 3 star."}
{"text":"Met up with Baldie after work for a drink and some wings. I had heard their salads were good, so I figured I'd try the place out.  We ate at the bar. The menu had quite a few Mediterranean items and I was gonna have what they called Spinach footballs (spanokopita)., I think. I decided on wings with a side salad. I asked the bartender Stephanie what wings she suggested. She said Babalo and the Garlic parm was good. The babalo is a mix of Buffalo and barbecue. I ordered them cooked well, no flabby skin. They were nicely coated with sauce without being drenched and they had a great mix of the the two flavors and the garlic parm was delicious. I NEVER order those, but she said they were finished off in the oven and the flavors were baked in and it made them crunchy. Wow! So goood!! She suggested a drink that was Strawberry lemonade. So good. Could've used a little more liquor, but I had to drive home, so it was fine. Side salad was boring, but their blue cheese made up for that. Baldie had the pizza, wasn't my favorite, too thick and doughy. But then again, I'm used to New York pizza. I'll go back for the wings tho."}
{"text":"Went on Tuesday for $1 slices and $1 PBRs, Miller High Life and Natty Light. The cheese pizza was decent (a little on the greasy side, not a ton of flavor). Apparently the pepperoni was very good... it looked different than the cheese so it may have different seasonings and preparation along with the addition of pepperoni. The up side was that the service was pretty good and the daily specials that they have are an awesome value. $3 for a slice and two beers is an amazing deal."}
{"text":"This is now one of my lunch hot spots. Well, if you can find a place to sit. It gets crowded!!!  The food is always hot when it hits the table and it arrives in a timely manner. Servers aren't right on top of you because of the crowd but they manage it well. I strongly recommend the 5 Meat Pizza!!! My wife loves the Asian Chili wings."}
{"text":"Pasta entrees served in foil containers?  Really?  Salad served in plastic to-go container?  Really. Even when dining inside the restaurant.  Two star rating is generous - the service was good, but otherwise, a big disappointment. 

Neither pasta dish had much flavor, the chicken fingers had so much of a coating, they were difficult to eat, the salad was little better than a burger king salad and it wasn't a great value for the price.  I haven't tried the pizza, but I am definitely not headed back soon."}
{"text":"I am new in town and stopped by for dinner. I should have tried the pizza first but tried the eggplant parm instead to go(carry out). When I got home I was a little confused being from Brooklyn NY. I have never seen eggplant cooked in a deep fryer in my life. I was surprised when I took my first bite because I never had this hero chew crunchy or oil/grease shoot out like a cannon. It seems like it might have been over cooked??? I was starving so I forced myself to try to eat some more of this unfamiliar hero. I couldn't do it anymore so I threw it out. My dog would bite me if I fed this to him. I will go back one more time and try the pizza just because of the reviews but if this goes sour forgetabutit!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We moved to Fort Mill in August, live around the corner and have been here 5 or 6 times. We only return for the convenience and the pizza is not bad. Not great, but not bad. We always sit at the bar to get food to go and have a drink, but the bar service is consistently awful. It seems like unless you are a daily regular, the bartenders do not care about you. I have sat at a half empty bar for 6 minutes before being acknowledged while watching the bartender chat with regulars. I spent 22 years behind a bar and I get taking care of regulars, but this has happened each time. And if you try and call ahead, you will likely get hung up on, which has happened 3 times. We would eat here more often if the bar service was reasonably acceptable, but it is consistently not."}
{"text":"You want to take a shot of jager on a... let's say Wednesday, at like... noon, well, you found the right place!
Welcome to the dark side of mankind, or at least that's how I felt being there, observing several heavy drinking patrons in the middle of the day during my lunch break.  The place is dark, they even tinted the windows.  The \"decor\" (if I can even call it that) was confusing, bar on one side, the other side looks like Chucky Cheese (minus all the games).
It's a typical hole in the wall place.  They have a decent pizza lunch special ($4.75 2 slices with a drink).  I ordered a philly cheesesteak (half).  It's a pretty big half, but unfortunately, it looks and smell better than it tasted.  Kind of plain.  The seasoned waffle fries were better, even though they're definitely frozen and bought in bulk from some food supplier.  
I see that they have 50cents wings night, dollar pizza slice night, karaoke on Fridays and other \"special.\""}
{"text":"Nice staff, but awful food. Greasy and without flavor. My salad was served in a disposable container, as were my baked shells. Felt like I was eating at a truck stop."}
{"text":"Been to carmellas several times and have yet to get a mediocre meal. Word to the wise, if you order a large sandwich it will be large.  Probably enough to save for tomorrow.  Pizza is probably the best in fort Mill. Bar is always busy and the bartenders are really friendly.  I've seen some negative reviews, but I have to say that for me I haven't had anything but good to great food and service.  For a place that you can spend about $20 for a family of four I'll take that any day."}
{"text":"First time here, the pizza was very oily and not to tasty...they have outside seating but you have to order inside then take your food outside in a togo box, yes I didn't believe it myself.  They said it was some kind of law/rule...interesting every other restuarant near had outside seating where you could sit outside and order....they are new and hopefully this will change...either way not worth it for the pizza...considering there are so many amazing pizza places in the clt area"}
{"text":"This used to be a good pizza joint.  I am sad to say used to.  Going in we passed what looked like a meth head lady smoking out front.  We seated ourselves.  I mentioned that the Panthers game was not on any of the TV's and the response was \"well it was, that's weird.\"  I ordered a house calzone.  I see they are skimping with plastic silverware but also filling the calzone with about long strips ofa whole yellow onion.  It said there was ricotta but if there was I didn't see any.  So I had a onion calzone.  The calzone was messy, and was served on paper.  Essentially, if you cut your calzone you had to sift through the soggy paper.  The kids had a pizza brought to them by the lady who was smoking in the doorway out front.  We asked specifically if they could change the channel to the Panthers game.  The response was the manager said you have to sit at the bar to watch the game.  No one else was in the dining area but us.  Also, when it was brought to the attention that the paper the calzones were served on was less than ideal the staff finally recognized maybe a plate would be a good idea.  We were almost done and we said forget it.  I can see what effect management can have on a restaurant.  Any issues such as games on TV's were not remedied but answered by essentially that's too bad.  It was Sunday football and I was afraid it would be too crowded.  I see why it was not and I will not go back.  By the way, we have been going here for many years and I would have given t 4 stars then."}
{"text":"Amazing drink specials! $1 beers and $1 slices every Tuesday. Great place to watch the game!"}
{"text":"Great pepperoni pizza. Yeah its a little greasy but its pizza! Montford needed a good pizza spot and i'm happy this place filled the void!"}
{"text":"Love the crust on this pizza. The sauce is decent, cheese is okay, the pepperoni was not the best quality. 
My friend ordered an everything slice, said it was good, just wished so cheese was on the toppings to hold it together."}
