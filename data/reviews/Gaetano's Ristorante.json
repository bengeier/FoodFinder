{"text":"Ever since I moved here 3 years ago, I've heard about this place.  Mostly rave reviews.  And I have to say the food was good. Not the best Italian food in the city, but good.  But I didn't enjoy my experience and here's why - I'm going to DINNER.  NOt a used car lot.  Stop trying to upsell me on what I want to eat for food.  Stop reciting the specials to me when i know what I want and just let me order.  I don't know, the whole time it peeved me.  I like my servers to be personal and nice, just not fake.  And it took eons for the bill to come after dinner.  Food-4 stars, Service-2."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last Friday night and the server knocked over a large glass of water.  He did not even say he was sorry.  He then did not change the table cloth but instead just tried to mop up the water.  He then left us to do something else.  We did not want to sit at a wet table so we moved to a different table and the server continued to ignore us.   I finally got fed up and we left.  I told the owner why we were leaving and he yelled at us.  He has now banned me from his restaurant. My story sounds like some other similar posts."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's just so good and fresh. Not too salty or heavy on the sauces. Have gotten take out each time, never have eaten in there. But, the bartender is awesome. My faves are the Butternut Squash Ravioli and the Spinach and Ricotta Cheese Ravioli. My bestie loves their linguini and clams. They load those clams on there!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times with a group.  The food is excellent, great ambiance,very comfortable.  We have had most of the main dishes and we all enjoyed our food.  Service is good, and usually the owner was present when we have had dinner.  A great find."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant that's just not what we expected in the busyness of Las Vegas. As soon as we came in we got excellent service from our waiter Oscar. It continued throughout the night All 5 of us were very happy with our meals .We found that we got true Italian food with fresh pasta and good quality sauces and proteins. They were very original and there were many options off the daily special menu. The Chiopinni was phenomenal  and enough for two people. The butternut squash ravioli was fantastic, very rich tasting and unique flavors to it. We ate so much that we didn't have enough room to enjoy the desserts which I'm sure would have been phenomenal as well. At the end of it all we got the bill and were pleasantly surprised with the price. Definitely a recommendation and we plan on coming here again and again when we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A true neighborhood classic.  We are always welcome every time we walk in the door.  Our favorites include the Ravioli appetizer, the Veal Chop (special), and the Sea Bass (special). Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"*4.5 Stars   We decided on Gaetano's for our anniversary and we were not let down. The atmosphere is very cozy and warm and the fact that it is family owned adds to the charm. The hostess is a bit gruff but she seem frazzled because they were very busy.  We had dinner on a Saturday at 6:30 p.m. It was already packed!! I would recommend making reservations. We made them on OpenTable.   Appetizer- We had the half order of chicken ravioli in pesto cream sauce- I would have liked my pasta cooked slightly longer, it was a little undercooked.  The filling and the sauce for this ravioli were absolutely wonderful. I was practically licking the pesto sauce off of the plate.   Salads- I had the caesar and my husband had the house salad. The caesar was good, just enough dressing, crispy lettuce, fresh croutons. Just a standard salad. The house salad was amazing! Mixed greens with shaved carrots, pine nuts, parmigiano cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. The balance of these ingredients were perfect. I loved it!  Entrees- They have an extensive list of specials as well as an impressive menu consisting of pasta and main entrees. My husband choose to have the Salmon stuffed with Dungeness Crab and I had the New York Steak. The Salmon was seasoned and cooked very well and was delicious. It was served on a bed of orzo with mixed vegetables. I ordered the steak medium and that is how it came out. It was topped with a balsamic reduction. You could really taste the flavor of the meat, it wasn't heavily seasoned. I would have preferred a little more salt and pepper. The steak was served with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. I was impressed with the entrees because the meat in both of our dishes was cooked perfectly. They really had so many things on the menu that looked good!!   Dessert- We didn't order desert but we were speaking with our waiter, Nick (who is also the owner's son) and mentioned it was our anniversary. He brought us some yummy tiramisu. Mild not too bitter. I don't know if I would order this again, but that is just my desert preference.   I order wine by the glass, but they have an extensive wine list consisting of full and half-bottles as well as full bar. My husband order GlenFiddich on the rocks. Based on the price, I would have thought it was 15 year, but it was only 12. A little overpriced. The only other thing I didn't really care for was the bread, it didn't seem very fresh to me.  Overall we had a wonderful evening and I hope to return to Gaetano's soon!"}
{"text":"Local, casual, good food. Hubby and I stopped for a bite at the bar and were greeted by the owner. I had the salmon, which frankly is never that amazing when eating out. But I must say this salmon was very good. Cooked just how I asked it to be. I had veggies on the side which were a little too heavy on the garlic but still a nice mix of colors. My hubby had chicken parm and said it was delicious. It certainly looked it. I like the atmosphere and the fact that it's right down the road. Great wine and bar selection as well!"}
{"text":"The food?  I have had better.  I had the pasta fagiola - tasteless and the pasta was way overcooked and falling apart.  My wife had the buffalo mozzarella... small portion, but not bad.  We split the \"special\" ravioli... oh and by the way, when the owner rattled off the extensive list of specials, he never mentioned prices... it was stuffed with very little sausage and very little rapini in an overwhelming cream sauce and my half was left under a heat lamp for an extra 10+ minutes...$24.95 - $8 more than the other ravioli from the regular menu  My wife had a glass of house white... a decent pour, but when she order another, instead of a fresh glass, they brought a mini carafe and poured it into the 1st glass... poor form and shorter pour.  No dessert, no coffee  I wonder if when they brought the bill they put a 7up on there because I wasn't drinking?  Maybe just a mistake.  I do feel that the $80+ was outrageous for what we got"}
{"text":"Went as a party of four. We had a coupon for midweek:  buy one entree, get one half price. We ordered appetizers and drinks, then 3 entrees. I just had soup. The half off was applied to the soup only. When I questioned the calculation I was ignored by the waiter and treated rudely by the owner. \"If you need $5 so badly I will pay you out of the tip jar\". I will never return."}
{"text":"Run-of-the-mill Italian with lots of fancy names thrown around but absolutely nothing special about the food AT ALL. And really, you're going to charge $2 PER shrimp to top off a painfully average $14.95 plate of pasta that maybe would have been a decent value at $8.95?? Get over yourselves.   Service was friendly but slow. Waited almost 45 minutes for 3 meals which were ultimately a disappointment.   Nice atmosphere, friendly enough staff, but hardly worth the exorbitant prices."}
{"text":"i totally agree with some reviewers here about the \"unkindness\" of the hostess (which i found out is the owner's wife!!). me and my wife got there with our groupon and the lady was actually knitting!!! like really??? who in the world would be knitting in a restaurant???that tells you already a lot about the professionals running this place.... she was totally rude and seated us where we did not want to(in an almost empty restaurant!!) claiming they had resarvations later on(such a liar since we watched the table we wanted to seat at it was empty for the whole dinner time til we left!!). the server named nick,went really fast over a couple of specials,and we made our picks on the regular menu(i got some gnocchi with gorgonzola and my wife got eggplant rollatine),my gnocchi were disgusting,my wife's food was ok,but when i was listening to our server going to other tables they had plenty of specials that night!!! so it seems the only care about local people that go there or anyway whoever does not have a groupon!! i lately found out anyway that guy was the owner's son!! concluding the very bad night ever the owner passed by totally ignoring us,he actually picked up his cellphone while he was passing close to out table,talking very loud not even caring he is in a restaurant. it seems like this restaurant is ruined by a bunch of countryside hillbillies with no mannerism,no knowledge about food or service!!!! we will never come back here, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE,TERRIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"This was literally the best Italian food I've ever had!!! The homemade pasta was wonderful! You have to try the meatballs too! Overall, the experience was amazing"}
{"text":"Ate here for the 3rd time yesterday evening and left quite disappointed.  The quality seems to have decreased significantly.  I would have rated it outstanding two years ago, good last year, and below average currently.  The calamari appetizer was rubbery, came out only luke warm, with a very mundane sauce.  My veal parmigiana, while adequate, was really quite ordinary and forgettable.  My wife ordered the fish special and was quite disappointed.  The service was adequate, but spotty.  We requested additional bread, was told it was coming, but it never arrived.  I was treating two additional friends for dinner, so I asked them to bring me the check.  Instead a different person dropped it off next to my friends, which was embarrassing.  It turned out to be the check for a different table.  When they brought the correct check, they once again dropped it off my my friends, forcing them to have to awkwardly hand it to me.  I also resent having an 18% tip added for a party of four--not because of the amount, as I would tip this much or more anyway if the service were good, but because it is insulting.  I doubt that we will be back any time in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried here tonight for the first time, we were impressed with the overall decor, very nice. Our waiter was friendly, we didn't order an app, but went for the main course, I ordered the special cioppino , the presentation was beautiful, and I must say it was  the best I have Ever had! I'm so full I can hardly write this review. We shall return."}
{"text":"A real gem on Eastern Avenue!  The food is amazing and the Gaetano martini is something special!"}
{"text":"Had fettuccini Alfredo with chicken, special salad of the day, bruschetta, and my wife had the salmon special stuffed with crab.  The bruschetta was not too crisp and the topping was cold. The pasta in my dish was clearly homemade and was delicious.  Overall the atmosphere, service, and food are excellent.  I strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here with the Mrs for Valentine's Day. Overall the service was perfunctory and the food was poor. I ordered the Branzino, which took way too long to come out and was bland. The Mrs ordered the spinach ravioli and it was loaded with too much black pepper. We only ate about 1/4 of our dishes before we gave up.   Also, while we don't expect the waitstaff to be superstars, we felt like we were imposing by asking for anything.  Generally, it was a poor experience. I'd have rather eaten a $5 burger at the Five Guys next door followed by a Pinkbox doughnut. I would have had speedier service and it would have cost a lot less."}
{"text":"The service was remarkable, very friendly, responsive and knowledgeable. The food however was mediocre at best. Four of us ordered a variety of entrees, none of which were even close to the fine dining prices. This will not be on our list for a return visit."}
{"text":"We were surprised at reading some negative reviews and found out on our own that Gaetano's was very good and nothing like some reviews stated. Service was great and attentive but not overbearing.  We started with ice teas and appetizers of Brietta and figs stuffed with goat cheese.. Only 3 figs so we had to split the last one (otherwise a fight)  delicious.  Mr. had the spaghetti and meatballs, normally he would have never ordered spaghetti but the meatballs made up for it.. large and absolutely delicious.  I had mushroom ravioli, light and creamy and not overpowering. The dining room was busy for 530p on a Wednesday night but service was still there.  I presented the groupon and when they brought the bill explained 18% tip was included. Nothing was hidden.  So after the groupon and the tip we still owed another 42.00 which was worth it.  The hostess did come over to bring change back (which we declined) and also said another groupon was out as of today 9-12.. Went home and bought another groupon.  A real gem found in a strip mall."}
{"text":"As a San Francisco food snob, I was delighted and surprised by the sophistication of this Italian restaurant in the middle of nowhere outside of Vegas.  As good as ANY restaurant in SF and better than most.  We were there on a Wednesday night and had the place to ourselves.  Bread was delicious, salad was flawless and we had one of that night's specials and it was superb.  Price was LOW by San Francisco standards.    Very attractive environment, quiet, good lighting, excellent service.  Wish it was in SF, I'd go there often."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, professional and attentive staff, large array of specials and most importantly nicely treated tasty food.  I had 2 of the specials, the cream of mushroom soup and the boned grilled half chicken. I have never had cream of mushroom soup this good... very complex taste but because it is so rich the portion would have served 2 nicely. The chicken was moist and tender if a tad under seasoned. If you're in Vegas for business or fun do something different and take the 20 minute ride to visit, you'll be glad you did"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. This was my 2nd experience at this restaurant and definitely my last! Our first experience was okay. Our waiter looked and had the personality of a zombie- rough living in Vegas? It seemed as though we had better luck tracking down anyone else but him to request water refills and anything else we needed. It took so long to get bread that we didn't think they gave bread at this restaurant, and we were perplexed at the idea that an Italian restaurant did not offer bread. I had the gnocchi, suggested by the owner with a side remark that I should order it because I would never make it at home? (Really?) the sauce was like one of the most flavorless marinara sauces I have ever had. It tasted like tomato paste. My husband got a seafood dish and loved it. Overall, it was overpriced. My husband wanted to go back for Valentine's Day and we got a Groupon. We have a very well behaved 15 month old child that goes with us when we dine out. We had just gotten seated when much to my dismay, we lucked out with zombie man again. He was more perky this time. We placed out orders and my son was sitting on my lap. He picked up one of the empty small salad plates on the table and as I was starting to put it down, the owner walked up behind me snatched the plate from my child's hand and proceeded to tell me how expensive the plate was. I was in shock! Who would treat guests in their restaurant this way? I don't care how much your plates cost! We got up to leave and he had the nerve to ask me if I had canceled my order with the waiter? How embarrassing for him. Side note* while this restaurant is \"nice\" they do have high chairs for children and toys for children claiming to be child friendly. I would not recommend going to this place, neither the food or service is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great upscale Italian restaurant.  Homemade rav's wonderful.  Server was excellent.  Everything is top notch. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my wife and I did not have a close to satisfying experience. Not only was my pregnant wife's chicken raw, but our waiter was extremely rude. Not to mention he only checked on us once. Lastly, he had the audacity to follow us to our vehicle for an explanation of his tip.  As his manager accompanied him outside after hearing the explanation of the horrible service, He proceeded to brush us off and went back inside the restaurant. I will not return or ever recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband's and my favorite Italian restaurant in the Vegas area.   We enjoyed the family restaurant atmosphere. Every glass of wine and every dish we tried were so good that thinking about it makes my mouth water. The first time we went, the owner's son was our server and he introduced us to a red zin that we fell in love with.   I took my husband to this restaurant for his birthday and he simply loved the experience."}
{"text":"We were at Gaetanos for Sunday dinner . Our waiter was so so nice and polite.  I ordered Venizon with mushroom Risotto and this was so delicious and the plate was so beatifly presented. My wife order the Sea bass Piccatta with Cappellini Garlic and oil and it was very tasty and delicious.  We recommend anyone to try this gorgeous dishes."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Did I say great service? Also, most amazing chocolate mousse cake."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere was very nice at this restaurant, the food was really just fair at best and our overall experience here was extremely disappointing.  For an upscale Italian restaurant we expected much more. We got there at 6:30pm when there were just a few other parties there, however the service was still VERY slow.  We had a concert to attend at 8pm and thought we gave ourselves plenty of time, but after an hour there we were STILL waiting for our entrees we had ordered about 45 minutes before.  The salad we ordered before the meal was completely tasteless.  We asked for balsamic vinegar to drizzle on it to give it some semblance of flavor.  On top of that, my date does not like avocados but I do, so I asked for them on the side.  Our waiter said, \"we can just put it on two plates for you\".  Imagine my surprise when the bill came and our tasteless and small salad cost us $14.95!  He neglected to tell us that he was going to put a whopping $5 split charge on our $9.95 salad. It was a sneaky and deceptive charge that left a very poor taste in our mouth!  I understand that when you split an entree that a split charge is normal, but a small pre-dinner salad that was way overpriced to begin with? And then when it is split at your waiter's suggestion on top of that? And you also don't tell us about the split charge?  Just plain sneaky and dishonest, in my opinion.  My date also had their fettuccine alfredo, and while the homemade pasta was good, the sauce was very heavy and once again, fairly tasteless.  My chicken picatta was decent, but was just a notch or two above what you would expect to get at any garden variety Italian restaurant in the Olive Garden price range.  Once the bill came we were running late for our concert so I didn't have time to dispute the split charge, but due to our use of a $25 gift certificate, the waiter had put a whopping 20% auto-grat charge on the pre-discounted total, and once again neglected to tell he had done so (in what is in my opinion, a shameless and dishonest attempt to have people double tip).  I understand auto-grat with larger parties or with discounted meals, but 20%? And then you don't tell the customer? Needless to say, we will NEVER dine there again, and this review will hopefully prevent many others from sharing our very poor experience at this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants of all time. Excellent, attentive service. I've been a couple of times now and would recommend it to anyone. Try the veal milagnese or even the mezalune pasta."}
{"text":"I'm not really into Italian food but this place is pretty authentic.   We came here on a restaurant.com coupon for 25.00 and we heard so many good reviews about this place. We pretty much knew what we wanted to order based on other yelpers reviews. To start we ordered the Carpaccio which was topped with arugula and Parmesan cheese, drizzled with olive oil. The beef was cut paper thin and the peppery taste of the arugula along with the salty Parmesan was a perfect combination. The one thing that stood out for my was the olive oil which was very fragrant and can tell it was high quality. For our entrees we ordered the Ossobuco and the Ravioli stuffed with butternut squash. The Ossobuco was stewed in a red sauce which had deep flavors served over a saffron risotto. It was fork tender but the highlight of the dish was the bone marrow, it added so much richness to the dish. The Ravioli stuffed with butternut squash was my favorite. The pasta was cooked brilliantly because the filling to pasta ratio was perfect. I was served with a brown butter sauce with sage. Just the smell of the sage made this dish stand out.   Overall this place was really good. It was pretty crowded on an early Friday evening so reservations are recommended. I would definitely come back and try their other pasta dishes and deserts."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what other people are smoking on this site. I have always eaten well, at decently nice places. This place was completely horrible from the start. We came to the place Friday to look at the menu because we have lived in Henderson now for 11years and have wanted to try the place since we moved here. The hostess was rude and has no customer service at all. We took the to go menu and decided to eat at jalisco's. Tonight (Saturday) we decided to buy the groupon and proceeded to our reservation at 7:30. We arrive and this time no one is at the hostesses stand. The first person we see is the manager. No greeting from this guy period. He just sticks his finger up like one minute. Then comes the same rude hostess. She says how many? She then says two? I say yes. She says are you Bobby? I say yes. She says you no you have two reservations?  I say no. She says yes you did and I just deleted one. I'm thinking OK great. A hello, welcome, heck anything is better than telling me what she thinks I Might have done wrong. We get to the table and the waiter approaches us and ask's would you like something to drink. I say coke, he says we only have Pepsi. I said what else do you have. He ignores me and takes my wife's order. Then he looks at me and stares, I don't say a word. After about 25 seconds he says and for you? I again repeat what else do you have? He starts to name things,and I stop him and say I would like the tea. He leaves, comes back and says what would you like to eat. My wife ask if he has any specials? He rattles them off. He was actually good at this. My wife orders chicken parmesan, and I ask about the lasagna. I say how is it made. He stumbles over some words that I don't understand. Then he looks at me with a deer in the head lights look and says what do you mean how is it made almost in a challenging way. I say well is it vegetable lasagna and before I can finish he says it's meat sauce. I say OK but how is the lasagna actually made he cuts me off and says it's meat. I say OK. I'll take the lasagna. They bring my wife's food and it looks OK. Then they bring mine and I don't say a word. This its suppose to be fine dining? They bring me a boat. (A boat is a ceramic dish that is oblong not very big at all, and not deep at all.) I take a bite of this and there is no sauce at all. I was expecting a regular plate like everyone else. The taste was terrible. It taste like something I eat at someone else's house whose wife don't cook so well. The funny thing is he cuts me off and says its meat sauce. I had the guy that brings you the drinks get me some sauce. The sauce was actually good and it made the food stomachable. The manager visited this one table in front of us and hung out there almost half the time we were there. He never visited our table once. This place is terrible with customer service and food. I recommend you eat at someone Else's house that cant cook before you pay for dog food that not even the dog will eat. Disappointed I was celebrating a special evening with my wife. Boy was I disappointed."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the food and service (Shawn...I told him I would give him shout out). I went to their website and got the coupon. You can get $50 for $100 or $100 for $150. You do not have to buy the coupon up front. I get to eat at some of the top restaurants in town and you would easily pay well over $200 for the meal I had. Our bill came out to $143 including tip. My date had a lobster dish that was done to perfection. The lobster was tender and delicious. I had the butternut ravioli that was good but not over the top. The meal was complete with appetizer, salad, 4 glasses of decent wine, two main dishes, desert and two after dinner drinks. Yes, you can eat for a lot less but I wasn't holding back and it was every bit as good from beginning to end. I was seriously happy with this place and I would go back."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! It is a little pricey, but I bought a groupon, they are also on restaurant.com. I orded a salad and had the butternut squash ravioli. It was somewhat of a small portion, yet I was full with the salad and meal. The service was great and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the ONLY reason this restaurant is getting three stars from me is because the food was actually good. If I rated the service, they would not even get one star.   We had tried this restaurant when it first opened so many years ago, but had not been back since...until last night. My husband made reservations through reservations.com, and asked for a quiet, corner table as we were celebrating our anniversary. Our reservations were for 6:45 PM and the place wasn't very crowded at the time. After arriving, a waiter greeted us as he was stretching over to assist the people at another table. He grabbed a couple of menus and seated us (didn't ask if we had a reservation). Therefore, we were seated at a table between a couple with an irritable young child and a group of people that were pretty loud. We had to talk above normal levels just to hear each other. After being ditched by our waiter, we were finally served bread and water. More waiting as we are basically sitting, there as our waiter was tending to the tables around us, passing us by, barely glancing at us. This was the theme throughout the night.   We finally got our appetizer (delivered by a different server), which was a very good antipasto platter. Perfect for two people and had very good flavors. Our main courses were equally as good. I had a homemade butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sage sauce. It was excellent. My husband had their pork special, which he enjoyed as well. I do have to give compliments to the chef. We would have had dessert (since it was a special occasion), but the 45 minute wait after we finished eating was just a little annoying. Again, our waiter walked by us several times, not looking at us, just tending to his other customers. Oh, the owner or manager did come over to us and said our last name with a question like he was confirming our reservation. Then he left and the next time we saw him was to ask for our check.   We decided to go have our anniversary dessert at Crepe Shack and Waffles...much better service!   Will we go back...probably not. There are too many good Italian restaurants in Henderson to try that have much better service."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the place, but make sure to make reservations. Owner is traditional, friendly, and goes around to each table checking how you are doing. He is very nice. Food tasted very home made, worth the price. Lady in the front was ok. Think she was busy making sure checks were out and tables were available. Good staff overall. Ordered the Sicilian Eggplant with angel hair pasta with red sauce. Yum. Chicken Alfredo is a must have as well. White Zinfandel was $6 a glass but was perfect with meal. Would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. The food and service are tremendous. This is Italian like great East coast Italian."}
{"text":"A vacation for the pallet!!   I had friends visiting from GA. and wanted to take them somewhere special and, per their request, off the strip. I knew from having previously dined here often that Gaetano's would be the perfect place.   The cuisine here is authentic in every way. Order anything and you will be delighted. On this particular evening we had Arancini, Chilean Sea Bass, Butternut squash ravioli  and plenty of Gazpacho! Outstanding on all fronts!  Gaetano's is a family owned restaurant with the kind of personalized service only this type of proprietorship can offer. Very comfy atmosphere with pleasing decor.    I really cannot recommend this restaurant enough!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant. The food was wonderful and it was a nice place for a special occasion. The specials were lengthy but all sounded appealing. More of a nice night out than a family friendly kind of place. The ciopinno special was served on a platter and tasted as stunning as it looked."}
{"text":"Gaetano's is one of the nicest restaurants that I have been to in Las Vegas so far! We went there to celebrate our anniversary and we were not disappointed! I had their Chicken Picatta and asked for a few alterations such as sauce on the side, less butter etc. and everything I asked for they gladly accommodated! Their menu is very extensive and authentic Italian cuisine. Our water glasses were never empty and the service was exquisite! Lovely table cloths on every table which made for a very nice ambience! It's no wonder that they won Best of Las Vegas 6 or 7 times!"}
{"text":"Recently tried this place. I was afraid to try thinking it would be outrageously expensive. Guess what ? you get what you pay for..  Nice decor..great food..will love to go again"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Gaetanos family owned and operated service adn cusine for a celebration of my parent's 80th and 90th birthdays. From the friendly service, accomodating approach to working with our party of almost 16 adults, two children and an infant to the great food we were very pleased with our choice. The owners makes sure to make"}
{"text":"Pretty good service, friendly staff, not all that comfortable and the sauce is very acidic and a weird texture to it.  Just not what I thought it would be, tried it a second time and decided it was not for me."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Been in Vegas for 17years and I had no idea! I definitely will be returning. The apps are perfect, full bar and I recommend the ravioli!"}
{"text":"We've visited this restaurant a couple of times because we had the Groupon.  I love the Mezzaluna ($20).  Very tasty.  Finally left room to have the Tiramisu ($8.50) on the second trip.  Very fresh and tasted good.  I still like the Buca di Beppo tiramisu; better value.  Service was good; just disappointed that no one wished us a \"happy anniversary\" when we stated it on our reservation. Without a Groupon, it might be a little overpriced.  Chicken Parm was $24. One canoli was $4.95."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our 1 year anniversary. They kindly placed us in a quiet corner and gave us a complimentary dessert to top off our celebration.  The meal was absolutely fantastic! Excellent service and delectable meal. From the artichoke appetizer to the stuffed pastas. I don't know how you could ever go wrong with anything on the menu.  My compliments to Gaetano's!"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent.  Salads: crisp.  Olive oil: new and green not old and yellow.  Red sauce tastes like tomatoes, sweet but not sugary.  Pasta: al dente.  Filet mignon: tender but firm and grilled with slight -crust outside; I ordered medium and received what I ordered.  Branzino - flaky and flavorful.  Refills on water and bread  without asking. The wine list complements the food well.   The restaurant is large but not cavernous and the husband/wife/servers make us feel like our table is in a dining room not a restaurant.  Because we travel extensively, we eat out often and Gaetano's ranks at the top of our list for Italian food."}
{"text":"I eat at this restaurant every few months and am never disappointed. The food is always amazing, service is excellent and it is a local business. They specialize in authentic Italian dishes, so not just another chain serving the same old thing. Feel free to check the menu online but know that the always have server all specials not listed. I will continue to go for a wonderful dinner and relaxing evening out."}
{"text":"Dined here twice while visiting Las Vegas.  Butternut squash ravioli with brown butter & sage - delicious filling, tender pasta, loved it.  Linguini with clams, fresh clams, perfectly seasoned sauce, partner raved. Second visit, chicken picata served with roast potatoes and steamed vegetables.  The sauce was delicately seasoned, not overwhelmed with lemon, the chicken a little bit overdone, so not too tender, but overall enjoyed the dish.  Partner enjoyed the ricotta ravioli, lightly sauced.  For dessert an incredible creme brulee, The atmosphere is semi-quiet, subtle lighting, romantic.  Great service from Alex!"}
{"text":"Had a groupon for this place and it seems the owner was scolding his employees in front of everyone. He acknowledged everyone who didn't come in with a groupon except us. Our waiter could careless that we even existed. Everyone was getting their food before us. Food was okay but the sauce tasted like Ragu with diced tomatoes added. Only thing I liked were the meatballs.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I grew up in a traditional east coast italian family, so many italian restaurants in vegas that others love...i find just \"Meh...\"  This place is my absolute favorite italian restaurant so far in Vegas, and one of my fav overall places as well! The food has always been delicious, as well as authentic and freshly made meals. The service is excellent as well! I love the ambiance here, and the fact that its run by a sweet italian family!! It kinda reminds me of being home I think :) The son is usually our server, but last night i took the BF out to dinner on date night the dad came over to say hello, explain the specials, and the wine list....the BF isnt the biggest wine drinker so he helped us pick out a bottle that he and I would both enjoy, and i have to say we both thought it was delicious!  I try to make myself get something different each time I eat here because everything is always so good, but I am so in love with the gorgonzola gnocchi....i think about it every day I'm dieting!!! haha...  Its really nice to see a REAL italian, family-run restaurant in the area...I hope they continue to do good business!!"}
{"text":"I love Gaetano's. Very friendly staff and the food is delicious. Classy decor."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with friends last night.  The service was excellent as the waiter and owner both came over to discuss the food with us.  There were over 5 specials available that were all amazing.  The portions were large and the food was some of the best Italian I have had."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was good. The only problem was we had an 11 month old baby and instead of walking us towards the main dining room,  the server walked us towards the back through the bar area and seated us right at athe back by the bathroom.  We were pretty much isolated from the  other customers and there were a lot of seats available!!  My husband and I will NOT being going back there!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant if you want to get off the strip.  Food was authentic and delicious - definitely ask about the specials - pork dish and fig appetizer were the best.  Veal Piccata on the regular menu was best I've ever had.  Service was stellar from the moment we walked in the door.  One of the best cappuccinos I've had at a restaurant. Only negative is be prepared for a $35 cab ride each way but DEFINITELY worth the trip.  In fact if you factor in the cab fare to the total cost of the meal, it's probably not any more expensive than going to an upscale Italian restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"Simply put, this hidden gem of a restaurant is some of the best food I've eaten in this town. The service is always impeccable... The ambience is beautiful and romantic but really great for groups as well. The food is beyond delicious. The eggplant rolitini is my fave meal but they also have homemade pappardelle that's amazing. They always have seasonal items (like figs, soft shell crab) so it's always a treat to see what new things they have. My favorite restaurant in the town. They always have a groupon and if you sign up for their newsletter they have deals as well. Always a fantastic meal!!!"}
{"text":"Rude rude owner I was at the bar  and some one call for a cork fee  he went off it seems like all servers are so afraid to said anything to do not get fire  I wonder if he does any bs with his employees  Labor board should  look on his papers  he must to be doing something wrong legal ... Good luck  u bastardo .."}
{"text":"Went back (again) and wow! So love this place every time! One of the specials for the night was pear and gorgonzola ravioli with brown butter and sage. Soooo good. The server told me that they post their specials on their website everyday, so yay! I can check ahead of time for when my favorite specials are being served."}
{"text":"Irritating Hipster Service, Amazing food and deserts. Myself and a few friends decided to check this place out because of a Groupon special they were having. If you spend 40, you receive 20 off. Great deal for some amazing food along with the relaxing Italian ambiance. The only problem with this place I found noticeable was the service. We all agreed that once the server was aware that we were using a coupon, the smiles and quick service began to decline. Our server had one of those keep calm and chive on Mustashes \"Ironic Handlebar\" which was adorned with the classic Ben Folds Glasses. Each of us ordered a desert and the special, so it wasn't like we went to order bread, water, and skedaddle. Anyway, the food here is some of the best I've had in Vegas. The server could use some pointers in Italian hospitality. It was one of those situations where you tell the waiter that you both will be sharing the dish and he slowly repeats what you said in a judgemental tone. We still left him a tip large enough to fill his belly with some PBR and maybe enough left over to save up for a Fixie."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have eaten here numerous times, each time with their groupon. Having the groupon makes this without a doubt the best Italian restaurant in town and it's fairly inexpensive. The service is always excellent and the food is the best Italian I've ever had. They have a very nice atmosphere and it's always very quiet because the only time I've seen it be more than half full was on New Year's Eve. I plan on continuing to dine here on a regular basis. Should they ever stop accepting groupons that wouldn't stop me, their food is really just that good!"}
{"text":"Excellent Fettuccine Alfredo!  Best I've ever had with lots of Alfredo sauce and great flavor.  Above average atmosphere.  Spaghetti and Meatballs dry and zero flavor.    Very expensive but at $20 (Even with no salad) I would go again for Fettucini Alfredo.   If I wanted to take a guest from out of town for a nice Italian Dinner, I would take them there but warn against such a simple dinner as Spaghetti.   Not sure I understand how they could be so off on that one...."}
{"text":"I purchased a $40 groupon and went for dinner with my husband and 2 friends.  There was free valet parking, which was nice.  They had a large menu; everything was a la carte, however.  We did not choose the expensive items on the menu, sticking with the ravioli and pasta entrees. We all had the caesar salads and only ordered 2 wines and 2 beers,   We agreed the meals were tasty enough, but on the small side.   We shared 2 desserts between us.  The bill came to over $200.  If you can afford it, this is a nice place with good food."}
{"text":"I have been in search of 3 things in this town.   1. Good Service  2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home.  3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.  After eating at Gaetano's on Monday I can say I'm getting very close.   Service Once we arrived we were greeted and sat at a great table in a very nice dinning room area. Our servers name was Zach. He was very knowledgable about all the food and timed his stops at our table perfectly.   The Food We originally selected Gaetano's because of an email that advertised veal. However, once we asked about it we were told they ran out of it days before. (This along with the fact that they didn't honor our Yelp checkin special coupon because we already had an open table discount, was the only reason they didn't receive 5 stars). After learning they were out of the veal we selected the Sea Bass and the Calamari. Once they arrived we couldn't stopped eating them. The taste of both dishes was hands down better then I could ever cook myself! So I can't wait to go back!  The Bill We got bread, an app, 2 main dishes, desert, a bottle of wine, and a cappuccino for just over $100! The food was amazing. The service was fantastic. And the whole experience was right in line with the bill. Oh and just so everyone knows we were not forced to pay a gratuity.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. But the hostess is simply awful. She is rude and mean and surprisingly makes the whole experience negative.   We will not be returning because of her."}
{"text":"I was delighted to learn Gaetano's Ristorante is owned and operated by the same family that owned Gaetano's in Calabasas, CA - a long time favorite! The interior is beautiful, charming and romantic. I tried to go into a complicated description of the type of \"Skinny Cosmo\" I wanted, and I was told they already have one I could try to see if I liked it. It was perfect. My husband's martini with a twist was also properly prepared; the twist wasn't just added to the glass - the vodka was infused with the lemon oil. Now to the food: I ordered the special gazpacho, and it was delicious. It tasted like a farmers' market on a spring afternoon. My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs because, you know, if they can't do that right it isn't good. The meatballs had an incredible flavor, and the sauce was seasoned and cooked perfectly. My risotto special (chicken and asparagus) was about as close to heaven as I could have imagined. We had tartufo (pistachio and dark chocolate) for dessert. The wine list is expansive and \"fair\", meaning there is something for everyone from someone who just wants a glass of house wine to the wine connoisseur who needs to pair the wine specifically with the food. I cannot wait to go back; the return trip will be soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food; incredible service! This place has been around for many years and there's a reason for that! Chris is a fantastic server - ask for him."}
{"text":"I cannot find fault with Gaetano's. Not one. Okay, it ain't cheap (we spent close to $100 for two between two entrees and two cocktails) but it's worth every cent. We've been here a couple of times and although it's far across town, it's worth the drive.  The ambiance is very nice. Clean. Classy. Great date night place. The hostess (I assume Mrs Gaetano) is very friendly. Our server, Gaetano's son, was very knowledgeable about the menu and all 4, count em 4, entree specials. We saw Gaetano make a few rounds. You can tell this family takes great pride in their restaurant and food.   We skipped over apps and indulged in the delicious bread basket. The Italian loaf is soooooo good and obviously made on site. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs (tip: this is not on the menu even though it's hands down the best spaghetti and meatball dish I've ever had. No, really, it's the best. So good, in fact, that I never order spaghetti and meatballs at any other restaurant. Yes, it's that good.). The BF ordered the pork bracciole special which came with pillowy homemade gnocchi. Both our entrees were freaking delicious and the portions were huge. This sets Gaetano's apart from some of the other nicer Italian places in town. They don't skimp on portions. We had plenty leftover for the next day. And the leftovers tasted just as good as the night before. The BF says the bracciole tasted even better the next day.   I highly recommend Gaetano's. Order the spaghetti and meatballs and thank me later!"}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say it was my first time here {I live SO close}, but well worth the wait, Food & service were wonderful. I NEVER eat ravioli, but the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini looked SO good except for the peas. I asked if they could 86 them, & they did. It was better than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Went there for my first time yesterday via GROUPON. It's a cute restaurant, nice for a romantic dinner. But I was slightly turned off by people wearing shorts and a UNLV t-shirt during dinner.   Food: To start, we had the fig wrapped in proscuitto with goat cheese sprinkled on top ($10.99?). The flavors were on the spot - the saltiness of the proscuitto with the sweetness of the fig and the creaminess of the goat cheese. Wow. For the main course, we had the salmon and the Capellini alla Checca ($14.95) to share. It was a very good combination. Salmon was cooked well, but slightly a little too salty for my taste.  I paired my dinner with a glass of the Sangiovese, Santa Cristina (Toscana, Italy) which was $9.50. \"A medium-bodied Italian red with raspberry flavors ,a soft texture and a light fruity finish.\" I was pleasantly surprised by the wine.  I would definitely go back again. Dinner ended up costing about $75 in total, and with the $40 groupon, I only paid $44 with 18% gratuity included."}
{"text":"I love going to this place everyone is nice to you and food is really I have had  linguine with Clams and the see food Special which was very good Family owned and run restaurant can't go wrong love the waiters and the place in general!"}
{"text":"Always good food here! Large portions for a decent price. Family owned which is nice. However they always have a never ending specials list they have to ramble off to you, usually at least 10 detailed specials long. Besides that, nothing disappoints here! The pizza bread is amazing too!"}
{"text":"My family and I bought a Groupon to this restaurant. We always drive past it and never tried it, but so glad we did! The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious. Definitely a romantic restaurant! The owners were super friendly and attentive. Try it!"}
{"text":"Food: 5, Service: 2, Ambiance: 4  We went here prior to a Vegas show, after reading reviews.  We thought an hour was sufficient on a weekday for a quick meal.  We arrived at 7:20 pm and were seated fairly quickly.  However, it was 7:37 before anyone acknowledged us and took drink orders.  Our order was taken at 7:42, but the salad did not arrive until 8:10.  Keep in mind that we had told the waiter we only had an hour.  About 5 minutes later, the entrees arrived, and we had to send one back because it contained onions which we specifically asked to exclude when ordering.  The food was actually quite delicious.  Their signature salad included warm shitake mushrooms and the chicken marsala was flavorful without being greasy or dried out.  Too bad we didn't have time to finish our meal.  We had to flag down people for drink refills and the check.  Later we found out they were short handed, but that didn't help our situation."}
{"text":"Its been awhile, but dinner was incredible. I knew Gaetano back at his restaurant in Calabassas CA. He has done a beautiful job with the decor a much bigger place than the it was in CA. A must go to when in Vegas. Enjoy.  P.S His brother has a restaurant in Brentwood, Palmeri, one of my favorite places to go in L.A. Chef Ottavio Palmeri."}
{"text":"Incredibly accommodating and efficient  service by Alex and others. Delicious food and nice atmosphere. I will be back."}
{"text":"They HATE coupons here ... had a restaurant.com coupon and drove 30 minutes on Christmas Eve just to try this place and on the door of their restaurant they had a \"no coupons tonight\" sign posted.  Sure would have been nice to know before wasting an hour of my time to drive there. Their prices are outrageous for the portions, too.   Don't waste your time - go somewhere else that VALUES its customers."}
{"text":"Favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.  Very rare to find a family owned place here.  The food is amazing, this coming from a NY gal.  It is so hard to find good Italian food out west, but we found it.    It is our go to place now.  Thank you for the fabulous service as well."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with browned sage butter, and it was delicious. My boyfriend ordered one of the specials, which was also delicious. The service was excellent, the atmosphere was very nice too. The prices seem reasonable for the quality of food you receive. Also, there is a really yummy bread basket included with dinner! Try this place if you're looking for some delicious Italian pasta."}
{"text":"Higher end, great service, nice atmosphere! We go here every month or so. I always ask for Nick because he is professional, nice and always has something interesting to say about the food, wine, etc. we always leave happy!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has nice atmosphere and was only half full. Service was nice but very slow. We ordered the mussels with clams and  artichoke fritters to start. Then the chicken piccata and butternut squash ravioli for dinner. They were all OK. None of the dishes offered anything special. The high prices are not justified by for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"Delicious meal with wonderful service. There was a large group in house and the hostess (maybe the owner?) moved us without us having to ask. Was then seated at a nice, quiet table for our very rare date night. I had the special which was pappardelle pasta with filet mignon, and a Marsala type sauce. My husband had the pollo parmesana. We split a vanilla bean creame brûlée for dessert. So good!"}
{"text":"Rare cause it's a family owned, well-known, successful italian restaurant, I absolutely love & to me.. it's better than Giada's.  Hate to say it Giada lovers.    First, I see what the chef's special are.  PAPPARDELLE FILLETTE please put this on your menu Gaetano sir, please.  Or as a weekly chef's special.  My only complaint is that this is not on the menu.  Melt in your mouth.  You will happily gain 5lbs or trade in your dessert for it... or get both. . Melt in your mouth, homemade pappardelle w/ mushrooms & a shredded filet throughout.  The first bite shocked me.  I can name many other dishes that are mind blowing since this is a chef's special. The Insalata di Cesare & Penne alla Vodka w/ chicken, other than that I always go w/ the Chef's Special.  It's exciting & keeps me from always ordering the same thing.    Certain Italian restaurant's have their most perfect dishes such as I love a certain veal parmesan, chicken parm, parm chicken, different things, different places.  A few items I do like at Giada's, so I know it's a strong statement.  Gaetano's has a consisitency & family type recipe you can taste in the sauce.      Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"WARNING: do not use Groupon here. They automatically put the gratuity on the bill. They will overcharge on the wine. Their house wine was $1.50 per glass more than the wines in their wine menu. Portions are extremely small and grossly over priced. The fettuccine had no flavor, it was greasy and the noodles were glued together. Had to season it with red peppers, salt and pepper. I was ready to ask for ketchup to give it flavor. If you are looking for a good Italian restaurant DO NOT GO HERE. I hate to say it, but you'd get a much better meal at the Olive Garden at much better price."}
{"text":"I went the first week the restaurant opened, which was about 8 or 9 years ago...and did not go back until this week.  I saw it on Groupon, so thought it was a good  opportunity to try it again.  First of all it is a beautiful room, and not very busy.  In fairness the food was 5 star, it was these odd occurrences that took it down to a three for me, and a 0 for the friend who went with me.  I ordered a roasted beet salad, when it arrived it was beautiful, but I grabbed the plate and it was filthy underneath.  I am always hesitant to send something back, but I just could not eat.  I know it is easy to have dirty plates in a restaurant, so I very gently explained to the server, I saw him take it to the manager.  A different server delivered a new one about half  of the size on a smaller plate.  Then the manager hurried by and said under his breath said \"enjoy your salad\".  Well I have seen enough exposes that that really creeped me out.  So although it was delicious I was uncomfortable eating it.  Although the restaurant was very quite, the manager never said a word to us.  No apology, no reduction in price, no acknowledgement that something had gone wrong.  My friend did not eat her dinner and I asked if she did not like it, she said the whole thing left her with such a bad feeling she could not dine comfortably, and would never go back, hence her 0 star rating.  I think I would have had a much better feeling about the whole experience if the manager would have at least come and apologized."}
{"text":"Food is ok nothing special. Chicken parm for 26 was not worth it. Taste was mediocre and sauce was just bland. Even with Groupon not worth going. Double the price of any other place in Vegas"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and don't get me wrong about service. The waitress who waited us was wonderful. But the person who seated us was a little rude. We have 3 kids under 7yrs old and they were pretty excited about the place but then when they were seating us the person seating us yelled at our kids and said that they needed to quite down but for us our kids weren't very loud compared to those who were in the restaurant yelling swear words drunk. Hype person who seated us said to our kids there is no yelling, no cursing and no getting crazy. I was furious but didn't make a statement because I know our kids wouldn't do that and they know not to be rude and yell out bad words. They were being kids excited to eat. Like said, food was great but probably not was a great idea taking kids."}
{"text":"I had the duck breast, one of my favourite dishes, and it was a little tough and not seared as well as it could have been. It was almost as if it was nuked. I wouldn't recommend this dish if you love duck. The atmosphere, however, is very nice as long as you're seated away from the service station and the kitchen door. I would return to this restaurant for the pasta dishes. The entry meat dishes are a little expensive."}
{"text":"Our 2nd time here! And I liked my food selection better this time. We were with another couple who were first timers and had a Groupon offer.      Started with   which was good, not great the bread was to chrunchy as when bitten into the bread fell apart~        All our entrees were very good, salmon pieces in pasta with a vodka sauce, 2 orders of  spaghetti & meatballs and rigatoni w/ meat sauce. The first 3 were specials~ the dessert menu is meza meza~predicable Italian options of which none were ordered.     Our server was attentive & DEFINATLY knew the menu!      A very nice dinner out at good prices. Would go back again & again"}
{"text":"What a pleasant evening! The food here is outstanding, the service is outstanding, and the restaurant itself is elegant. If I could, I would give it six stars."}
{"text":"Had one of the best meals. Started with soft shell crabs over crispy potatoe sticks, buratta over arugula, then moved on to main course. 4 of us shared salmon stuffed with dungess crab, ahi tuna over arugula, and a special, cioppiono, there was nothing left to take home, then finished meal with Gaetano special coffe. Which has no coffee at all, but bittersweet chocolate and several liquors, followed by tiramisu and cannoli. We all rolled out of there totally satisfied. Our waiter Kevin treated us like we were his favorite customers. All in all, a great dining experience. We had a living social coupon, but we're treated like we paid full price. This is now our favorite restaurant. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner.  Gaettano is amazing.  He basically ordered for us.  Great apps with prosciutto and figs as well as the beet ravioli.   Wines were great and the prawn risotto was on tonight.  The chicken Marsala was great too.  The Marsala wine sauce was the best I have ever tasted.  My friend went with the tried and true chicken Parmesan  and was not disappointed.   We ended with the famous coffee after dinner drink that will surprise everyone that gives it a try.   Do not miss it."}
{"text":"First time at this jewel of a restaurant. Everyone was so nice and appeared to be genuinely happy that we were there. Our seriously handsome waiter Steve was well informed and very attentive. I used a Groupon and so glad they offer that service since I don't think I would have discovered this place since I'm on the other side of town. 3 words to know : Chilean Sea Bass. It was a special, we signed up for emails just to know when we can have it again!  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"In search of a new / different Italian restaurant in the Las Vegas area, I stumbled upon Gaetano's via Groupon and decided to give it a try, as it was my honey's birthday.  We were both pleasantly pleased!  The service was fantastic, the food was fantastic and the prices were right where they should be... fairly priced for the quality and service.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  However, the prices were over-inflated.  The service was very good even when the restaurant had run out of items.  Although we would likely go again, the cost/value ratio may affect that."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend to celebrate Valentine's Day (the Saturday before) and made the reservations through Yelp/Open Table -which worked successfully, if anyone is curious. I took advantage of the Restaurant.com offer, of course (including a coupon code, therefore getting a $25 certificate for $2 :D)  I heard about the place a long time ago and wanted to try, so finally took advantage of the gift certificate. The atmosphere is nice (dim, calm and romantic) when you walk in you can see they've won a few awards. I really like the way it is tucked into the corner of the strip mall/area and the way they utilized the space. I felt like it was a place you could find in a more urban area and like I kind of made a discovery. I could instantly tell this place was family owned, and the owner was very nice (and funny). He seated my girlfriend and I and rattled off all the specials. I liked the guy because he reminds me of some of the family members on my dad's side from \"the old country\", he made sure to cover the details of the specials and addressed any of our questions. Our waiter was a nice guy too, very personable, answered our questions, helped make suggestions etc.   Okay onto the food..  The traditional appetizer bread that you get with the meal is awesome. Fresh made, fluffy, warm and tasty. The sticks with marinara were so good and they even offered to bring us more (which we declined because we ordered quite a bit of food).  For the appetizer we had the melon and prosciutto. The prosciutto was a decent cut and was tasty, and the melon was fresh and crispy. Also it was a more generous portion than I expected- we were given 6 good slices of prosciutto and melon.  It was really good, the only thing I would've changed was the melon was really cold (which is understandable because they have to refrigerate the slices/melon I'm sure)- but it can make it hard on sensitive teeth, just a personal preference. Either way, I recommend it.  My girlfriend had the Fettucini Alfredo with shrimp. She raved about it (I am not a fan of heavy cream sauces- particularly Fettucini Alfredo- so I didn't try it) , but it looked very good. The pasta is home-made and had a very nice color to it, and the shrimp were a nice size. She has an Italian background and is familiar with homemade pasta and said it was some of the best she has ever had.   I had the New York Strip with peppercorn/balsamic reduction. It was VERY good, cooked well and very flavorful. Also, it was a nice cut and large (I cannot remember if he said it was 10 or 12 oz, sorry this was a week ago). The dollop of mashed potatoes along side were delicious, the best I have ever had. The vegetables were o.k. But that balsamic reduction definitely made the meal- the steak was fantastic. Again, it was a generous portion, and I took some home (which is a rare thing for me).  *Just a side note- the Osso Buco here seems to be the hot thing. The table next to us ordered it and it looks fantastic- I don't eat veal, but I'm actually hoping to return and try it*  After eating I had a cappuccino, which although I'm not familiar with, I thought was really good and well-made.  The price was very reasonable- considering the experience, portion sizes and quality of food (especially with the coupon/certificate we had).   The reason why I gave four stars (and not five) was although the service was friendly and good, it was slow. We were there a good hour and a half (maybe more). It took a long time for our appetizer and longer for our food. Also, my food was fairly cold when I got it (but my girlfriend's was hot). If they can fix that- solid 5. The place can get  really loud too- which personally I don't mind, it's something I actually enjoy in Italian restaurants (it feels authentic) but if you're looking for a quiet place were you can have a soft conversation I wouldn't recommend a Friday or Saturday night here, we had to talk a bit loud over the crowd.   In all, it's definitely a new favorite of ours, we're hoping to return soon when we can treat ourselves (maybe on a quieter night where hopefully the service will be quicker) and we would recommend it."}
{"text":"For the past 11 years, I have been dining at Gaetano's when I am in town.  The service and food is always exquisite.  The Palmeri family is always welcoming and creating new dishes.  Make this place what you want, spaghetti and meatballs or veal with risotto... you really can't go wrong with your choice.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It was excellent in every way. Service, atmosphere, apps, entrees and dessert. We had the fried squash flowers, fried calamari, linguine with white clam, and the butternut squash ravioli. Then a cannoli for dessert.  LOVE EVERYTHING!!! We will be back, thanks for a great experience. We had Zachary, and he was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Angel was our server. He was extraordinary in his knowledge and hospitality skills.  We used a restaurant.com voucher with no hassles.  Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"So normally when I come to Las Vegas, I dine like most other vacationers in town for the weekend. Brunch buffets, food courts lunches and an occasional overpriced dinner in one of the casinos on the Strip. Sometimes I make it to the Main Street Station 777 Steakhouse Grill downtown which I think is one of the best bargains in Vegas.  So when I friend told me that he had a place in mind for dinner on the outskirts of town in Henderson, I was more than happy to oblige. He had raved about Gaetano's before and I was eagerly awaiting to see what all the fuss was about, and also spend an evening away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  The great thing about this place is it's a family owned establishment with more locals than tourists eating there. It feels like a place that you would actually go out to for a nice dinner if you lived in the area! The owners are extremely friendly and chatted with us before bringing out our appetizer, a plate of assorted cheeses, bruschetta, olives, assorted bread basket and a delicious centerpiece of fresh mozerella drizzled with balsamic vinegar atop a bed of fresh arugula. The cheese will literally melt in your mouth, leaving you to crave another three or four pieces. But fear not, then there are the entrees...  Our waiter Nick was extremely friendly and knowledgable, and explained the specials to us in extreme detail, and they all sounded delicious. We could tell that he is very passionate about the food at Gaetano's. My friend ordered the chicken-asparagus risotto (off the regular menu), which he said was delicious. I also ordered off the main menu, mostly because of the rave reviews that the Ossu Bucco has gotten at this place. When it came, my eyes practically popped out of my head. What you had was an enormous shank of meat complete with the bone marrow sitting atop a bed of saffron risotto. I went straight for the marrow, spreading it onto the bread. That first bite may be one of my top 5 of all time. The shank was tender and delicious, smothered in what looked to be a tomato and red wine reduction sauce. It all went perfectly with the rich and delicious saffron risotto (who even thinks of such a thing?!?!). Needless to say by the end of the meal every last bit of marrow had been sucked from the bone, and by the last sip of my glass of house red wine I was practically in heaven. Oh yeah, and then there was the creme brulee with fresh strawberries that was one of the best I've ever had. So in order to sum everything up...  If you are ever in Vegas, GO TO GAETANO'S YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!   #Mange"}
{"text":"Ordered carry out and the service was great. It's a cute little place that's part of a strip mall. The food was ready when promised and hot and delicious. The bar staff was great and got me a water without even my asking while I was waiting. I would go back  and eat in and try a different dish next time."}
{"text":"Gaetano's was OK.  The food was pretty good.  The bread was amazing.  There were too many things we did not like, though, and we will not return.  1. We had a groupon for $40 and even with it, the bill was $70-something for 2 people.  It was definitely overpriced and not at all worth it.  We used to go to Carluccio's before it closed and would have the same quality meal for $50.  2. The server was weird.  While he was taking our order he kept looking up and toward the front doors to see who was coming in...really?  Are we not special enough?  Is it too much to ask to pay attention to your customers as they are ordering??  3. There were like 30 specials and the menu already had 100 items on it.  It wasn't really 30 specials, but it was too many.    4.  All over the menu there are things printed like, \"split salad charge\" and \"split meal charge\" and \"substitution charge.\"  Ok, we get it, you like to nickel and dime your customers...very tacky, especially when you are charging those astronomical prices.    Sadly, another italian joint off our list.  We have yet to find the perfect one in Vegas."}
{"text":"Outstanding. The food is delicious, nothing better than homemade pasta.  This place is so authentic. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Totally recommend Gaetano's. Such a hidden gem in Henderson"}
{"text":"Over years (more than two decades now), during my visits to Vegas, I've tried to find the best Italian food.  It seemed like it was what Vegas did best.  Long before Yelp, Zagat's (when they only had books) put me onto Gaetano's, but it took me a long time to get out here.  After finally making it to Gaetano's, I haven't tried another Italian place -- and I've returned to Gaetano's on every visit to Vegas.  Every meal has been outstanding.  I've even stopped visits to Nora's (I'm going to have to change that, Nora's is excellent too, though different.  Gaetano's is more \"fine dining\".  Nora's is a bit more casual -- though the difference may not be all that big to some).  I opt for traditional entrees.  I've had fish, venison, and the best duck breast I've ever had (it's easy to overcook the the duck).  Friends like the pastas.  The butternut squash ravioli have converted me.  Recently, my entree had sweet potato ravioli that was even better.  We love to get the spaghetti and meatballs for an appetizer.  They're not on the menu, but they're always available.  Meatballs made with fillet covered in a rich sauce.  My New York friends who I had to beg to try Gaetano's (\"we get great Italian at home, there's nothing youse guys can do out here as good as back in Brooklyn\") say it's some of the best they've had.  Service is impeccable.  We miss the departure of Danny who always took great care of us, but every other server is just as good.  The prices are not out of alignment with the Strip or where I live (Northern California).  I can see how those who like the Olive Garden might find Gaetano's pricy.  For those who like Olive Garden and are looking for a bargain, let me suggest Battista's Hole in the Wall down on Flamingo.  I think you'll find it much more agreeable than Gaetano's."}
{"text":"No doubt lots of good reviews on Gaetanos. Just went there for the first time. More formal and maybe 'upscale' than I thought it would be (double contrasting tablecloths, candles, wine glasses pre-set, waiters in ties, etc.). Nice decor, just not what I was expectin.. But enough of that, we were there to eat. The menu was OK. Basic staples of Italian not to be found,,,Spag and Meatballs, Chicken Parm, and others) This was more of an upscale menu (and prices), just like the decor. Lot's of veal, lot's of 'specials'. We got Bolognese and Chicken Marsala. Overall, we thought it was OK, but with so many good Italian restaurans in H-Son, did not seem to stand above, or equal to many. Nice to try once, but not for us. Service was good."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, excellent food and extremely attentive service. Come hungry because you'll have a lot of delicious food to enjoy once you get here."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to eat here (and Italian food is not his favorite) and it was about a 15 minute drive from the Strip. The hostess greeted us immediately and was very friendly. It seemed like a family run business and the owners (husband and wife) were very present. The service was EXCELLENT. There were a ton of specials but you can tell the servers are trained to preface that. My husband and I both ordered off the specials and were very pleased with our meals. The portions are generous.  We are from CA but strangely enough, my husband had friends that were also dining there at the same time! One of them emailed my husband a coupon for Gaetano's and we showed it to our server and he gladly honored it. I love how you can flash coupons from your phone these days! :) Is it the best Italian meal ever? No. Is it great family run Italian restaurant? YES!! It's definitely worth a trip to Henderson. Yes, I would go again."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Gaetano's twice now and was holding back on a review until I visited for a final time, done a full meal with wine, but unfortunately that meal isn't going to happen so I have to go on the two meals I did manage to get in there.  The first time for mains I had pasta e fagioli followed with braciole with gnocchi. The pasta e fagioli was nice and hot, but lacked a lot of flavor. The gnocchi were mushy, and the flavor of the braciole was decent, however I had a stomachache the next day.  The second meal I had squash ravioli for mains and they were quite good.   Waiters were great at describing the specials but didn't necessarily have a comprehensive knowledge of the rest of the menu, which is a fairly standard pan-Italian menu. Both times the service was inattentive during the meal but quick to give the check.   In sum, based on my two dining experiences this is a trattoria trying to pass itself off as a ristorante. The service is not first-rate and neither is the food. I wouldn't be able to rate this place with 1 Michelin Star, i.e. 'very good cuisine in its category'. A further visit might push my rating up but for the time being, 2 stars."}
{"text":"Totally awesome experience.  We really enjoyed ourselves and Gaetano came to the table and was very cordial!  He even gave us free calimari.  Every time we go to Vegas, we drive to Henderson just to eat there.  NOTE:  HE flies his seafood in DAILY from Santa Monica Seafood.  YUM!  PS - use the Restaurant.com Coupons for a great deal!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time...loved it! Great service, relaxing atmosphere, nice decor, delicious bread basket (or two...since we kept eating and eating and eating), fantastic food. We ordered the Linguine with Clams and Penne ala Vodka (plus meatballs). The linguine was wonderful with the light white wine sauce, and the vodka sauce on the penne was some of the best I've ever had. The meatballs were also delicious. We 100% recommend Gaetano's, and we will for sure be back soon."}
{"text":"I will cut right to the chase. Henderson has a five-star Italian fine dining restaurant. Yes it is that good. Gaetano's is located in a small fairly innocuous strip mall and shares a parking lot with Chipotle and Wild Wings amongst others. Don't let the location fool you. The restaurant itself is a fairly large dining room with very high ceilings. Very classy. Off to the side there is a bar that is walled off from the restaurant. After we were seated, our server, Steve, was at the table almost immediately to answer any questions about the menu and to tell us about the specials for the evening. Our busboy, food runner, and server all gave near perfect service throughout the entire evening. We started the meal by sharing the portobello mushroom appetizer. Excellent choice! For my entree, I went with the salmon stuffed with crab. My wife had the chicken marsala. Each dish was outstanding.  While the price point is a little higher than several of the other local Italian restaurants , the fact that this is fine dining with outstanding food, service, and ambience makes the price worthwhile."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. I will definitely be back when in town. Meatballs were to die for."}
{"text":"Great meal.  Had the Caprese de Pepperoni for an appetizer and the Veal with Shitake mushrooms, my wife had the stuffed salmon.  The food and atmosphere were fantastic.  I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Food and service were good . Atmosphere was also very nice . Portion size was moderate- the bread served before the meal was outstanding. They included the gratuity in my bill and didn't say anything so I ended up tipping twice which left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots to take friends off the strip. Great food,service and family run business. Only bad thing is they are only open for dinner. Never had a bad meal. Homemade and great fish."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing and the wait service is very attentive.  A good friend of mine recommended this place to me when I asked to venture out to an italian restaurant that wasn't part of the Vegas strip and I'm glad he did. Don't let the location fool you because its part of a strip mall next to buffalo wild wings and across from a jewelery store, because once you step in the restaurant the ambiance is warm and if the noise level is right, even couple friendly.   We started our dish with an appetizer (half order) of veal ravioli. Just the earthiness of the creamy mushroom sauce that accompanied the ravioli dish was very silky that when we had finished the raviolis, we sopped up the remaining of the sauce with our bread....it was that good!  Oh on the bread, it taste freshly made.  For our entree we shared Osso Bucco dish on a bed of safron risotto. The entree portion size here was big and enough for two individuals to share. The Osso Bucco was infused in a deep rich spices and cooked to the point that no knife, not even a butter knife is required. You litterally can cut the meat with your fork or spoon. The Meat on the Osso Bucco was very velvety and taking a spoonful of that with the saffron rissoto made the dish.   Oh! I can't forget the marrow that is with the osso bucco, if you don't want to eat it with the rest of the dish, spoon it on some of the bread and its like buttery patte.   As I am writing this review, a week later from our trip to Vegas, my mouth is still watering over this dish....and craving for some osso bucco."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. Very attractive restaurant with valet parking. Our waiter Jake and his associates were very attentive. Great service without feeling rushed. The food was EXCELLENT! My wife had Linguine and Clams and I had one of the specials, Crab stuffed salmon and we loved them both! We also had a tasty Caesars salad for two which was great. We saved room for a Cream Brûlée and The Warm Apple Pie a la mode and they were also very good! We will be coming back as we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the dining experience here, and would highly recommend you give it a try also."}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 star.   Nice decor and ambiance. Paintings on the walls, bottles of wine lining one wall, and a candle at each table.   I made a dinner reservation and the host was pretty efficient and we were seated quickly.   Our server was a bit slow. We waited about 7-10 minutes before anyone came to bring us menus or water. I've never really had that happen before and didn't know who our server was at the time as no one came to our table to greet us. I noticed throughout our dinner that service should be good for the most part, depending on who your server is.   Food:   Lamp chops- Delicious. I thought this was a nicely executed dish. Flavors were there and the lamb was done just right. I often encounter lamb overcooked so it became tough. This one was cooked properly and was still tender.   Thin slices of veal topped with grilled eggplant- I tried a bite or two of this but personally didn't find it very memorable. It was just okay.  Linguine pasta with clams in a red sauce- Tried a few bites. Another decent dish but not overly memorable. The clams were pretty good.   Tiramisu- Pretty good. I do love tiramisu and this one didn't disappoint. Favorite dessert of the 3.   Creme brulee- Not bad. Not overly eggy. I wasn't blown away but I also wasn't disappointed.   Cheesecake- Not bad either. Again, not blown away but also not disappointment.   Overall, I think it was a nice dinner. I think our server was a bit too slow considering the place was half full. I can't imagine what it would be like if it were a full house. Service did pick up a bit when other servers came to offer bread and fill up water. It has potential to be much better.   Would I come here again? Maybe. Food is pretty good. Service has potential to be good with the right server."}
{"text":"The interior of this place is nice and classy with dim lighting and all the waiters were dressed in suit and tie attire. All the tables had a lit candle on them. The hostess quickly sat us down and both her and the waiter was very attentive to our needs.  They gave free complimentary bread which had sourdough, pizza bread and a crispy sesame flatbread with balsamic oil dip. Unlike other Italian restaurants, the bread was very soft and warm. Let's talk about the food. I ordered the salmon stuffed crab w/ orzo pasta special and my partner ordered the rigatoni with meatballs. Both was flavorful but I think the salmon was cooked too well done. The meatballs were kinda hard to pick up with your fork. They should have a separate menu for all the specials only because the it will be easier to look through rather than the waiter having to say every item for the specials.   There were only 2 waiters working on a Friday night and it started to get busy around 7pm so our order took kind of long. Otherwise, the flavors are really great and if there were more servers here your food wouldn't take more than 30 min. Lucky there's a groupon for this place otherwise I would've never hear about this place."}
{"text":"The owner is absolutely awful! My wife's stomach began to churn as soon as we were seated and now wanting to be wasteful, she opted not to order an entrée but rather grab a smoothie from the Jamba Juice across the parking lot. My wife left the restaurant, and after I placed my ordered and informed our waiter of the situation, the owner quickly sprung upon me and in the rudest tone imaginable, she barked that if my wife was not purchasing an entrée of her own, that she would not be allowed to join me at the table. She then suggested that my wife wait in the hot car until I finished my meal. I reassured her that I was a paying customer and that neither of us had done anything wrong to warrant such hostility. The owner then made her way to the front of the restaurant and WAITED outside for my wife to return, scanning the parking like a hawk. Because I had texted my wife to inform her of the situation, my wife kept her head down and quietly rejoined me at our table; the whole time the owner never took her eye off us. To show her discontent, the she hovered over our table like a shark circling its prey, waiting for her opportunity for another confrontation. Uncomfortable and knowing that we had over stayed our welcome, I opted to pay the bill and leave quickly, rather than be a victim of her ridiculous antics. It was a no brainier considering my food tasted like it came from a can of Chef Boyardee. It was awful; in fact I would've preferred Chef Boyardee. In the end, I paid $75 for canned food and the worst dinner experience of my life. The only positive thing I have to say is that our waiter was friendly; too bad he has to work for such a terrible woman. How does this place stay in business? STAY FAR AWAY!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful dining experience last night at Gaetano's Restorante.  The owner came over and greeted us.  The staff were very nice and attentive to our every need.  And our entree's were wonderful.  I had the Cioppino and my wife had the Risotto. Both were real taste treats and enough to take home for another meal."}
{"text":"While family was in town I took them here on a Sunday night. Not very crowded at all which I was happy about. This was definitely a fine dining/romantic type of place. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Our server Zach was very friendly and definitely knew what he was talking about. I like that they bring out foccassia bread as well as regular Italian bread.  The quality of the food is very very good, you can tell its homemade and not frozen/canned/premade, the portions are just super small which generally is the case with fine dining. I would return, but probably just on a date on with family. If I was going out with a friend I'd go to Brio for happy hour. Definitely worth trying, but don't expect Buca portions."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Food very good. Our waiter Steve gave us the free appetizer even though we had a Groupon....that was very classy....love the attention to detail...nice place for a romantic date.....thanks again gaetanos you have a beautiful restaurant and wondering staff....Nick is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Italian food.  Superb.   Good drinks.  Super service.   Nice atmosphere.  Our favorite restaurant in Henderson.  And our out of town guests vote is best of Las Vegas as so we"}
{"text":"Always great! Went with friends and he requested beet ravioli which is never on the menu but they made it for us (we ordered it as an appetizer) and who would've known I would like beet ravioli? Buttery sage complimented the sweetness of the beets so deliciously. Rory and Gaetano always make us feel like family when we enter their friendly establishment! My saffron risotto with prawns was perfect! The prawns were grilled and so, so tasty which complimented the creamy, delicately flavored saffron risotto. I'll definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This spot is a must stop for anyone looking for delectable dishes in the Vegas area that are off the strip. They have previously won the best of Vegas award and continue to achieve that same standard."}
{"text":"We had an urge for italian and wanted to try a new place. Since my bookmarks just seem to keep growing, I decided to check there first. Not suprising, this place showed up.  From outside it looked like a typical strip mall restaurant but after walking through their doors, this place transitioned itself to a bold and elegantly decorated space. The dining tables were spread on a huge open layout, nice tall vaulted celing and dim lighting that set a nice tone.    What we got:  House Bread and dip: I loved the their plain slices of bread dipped in their olive oil red vinegar. But even better was their stick slices of what I call deep dish pizza with no cheese and just a little tomato sauce. We were off to a nice start!  Bruschetta: small thin toasted slices of bread with garlic, fresh chopped tomato and parmesan + herbs. Very nice but could of done without this, since their House/comp bread was great!  Ravioli di Pollo alla Genovese (homemade chicken ravioli with pesto sauce): chicken was pureed and stuffed in the delicate pasta surrounded by the typical pastel green color pesto sauce. It was Really Good! Only negative was that we felt that a little more chicken in each ravioli would of balance the pasta/filling ratio much better.  Ossobuco alla Milanese (braised veal shank, redwine, fresh herbs, tomato sauce served on a bed of saffron risotto): The Meat was Absolutely Delicious! Only negative is that it wasn't as tender as it could of been, maybe another hour or 2 of slow cookin' should done the trick?! Good size meat portion;although, I've had bigger. Bone marrow was tasty little treat but it was on the small side and filling seemed missing?! The risotto was perfectly cooked, paired with the shank and sauce, was incredible!!   * I also had a Sterling Cabernet with the Ossobuco and it was splendid :)  Tiramisu (homemade in house): Nicely presented and tasted fantastic. They use an Amaretto type liquor which definitly comes through and was quite unique from what I'm used to. And the texture was on a sharp point! Very nice choice to end a memorable dinner.  Beautiful Decor, Mellow Atmposhere, Great Food, Service Impressive and Value was Great for quality! Yeah, I like this place!"}
{"text":"Lovely elegant place with neighborhood atmosphere! The owner personally comes to your table & asks if everything was ok.. That's rare to me... Love it!"}
{"text":"A real gem for the neighborhood. They have a super friendly wait staff and delicious food. You'll find all your Italian favorites, plus and abundance amount of daily specials.   The restaurant starts you off with fresh bruschetta for the table and a bread basket filled with house made tomato focaccia, accompanied by a small dish of oil and balsamic for dipping. Not a bad way to start while you look over the menu.  Squid Ink Risotto (a special): toothsome, fragrant, and rich in flavor. The squid were tender and moist, but the dish could have used a hint of lemon or some sorrel. The risotto itself was cooked very nicely.  Veal Parmigiana (with a request of vodka sauce instead of marinara): kudos to making excellent pasta. It was perfectly al dente and the vodka sauce was delicious. The veal was moist and tender, had a thin coat of breading, which is what I like, and topped with fresh mozzarella. It's a pretty solid dish, although I would have liked my veal sliced a little thicker.  My father in law had their pan seared trout, which came super fresh. It sat next to a bed of spaghetti and marinara, again perfectly cooked.   I wish we had room for dessert, which means we will have to come back again."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Italian food and decided to try this restaurant out. Were very surprised by the ambiance of the restaurant and how great the service was.  Food was excellent and flavorful.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 5 and it was one of the most memorable meals ever.  The food was fantastic, but it was exceeded by the warmth and attentiveness of the owner and staff.   The ravioli sampler appetizer was great.  The veal scallopini was terrific.  But those who ordered the pappardelle with sirloin tips special hit the jackpot.  Their take on cioppino included half a lobster!  Everyone was happy with the food.  Very nice decor, not immediately apparent from the strip mall exterior.  Nice wine list.  Expensive.   But a truly exceptional meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a wonderful surprise. It's located in a strip mall and doesn't appear to be much of anything from the exterior. But once inside, it's actually modern, sophisticated, elegant, and even a bit fancy. But don't worry, most everyone patronizing was still dressed casual.  The wait staff were very professional, attentive, and courteous. The menu and wine list are both fairly extensive. And the list of daily specials was pretty extensive too. So many decisions!  I opted to listen to my fellow Yelpers and get the gnocchi gorgonzola. I don't usually go for gnocchi, but I definitely love gorgonzola. It was divine! Fabulously perfect gnocchi. And very rich and creamy sauce. And so incredibly filling. I took over half of it home. And it was still delicious reheated.  All in all, my friend and I had a very enjoyable dining experience with some very delicious pasta dishes. And it's only like 5 minutes from my house. So I will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious. Love This Place. I go there when I want to spend a little bit more and want something other man my $1 pasta at home. I would give it 4 stars for the portion size; because they could add a little bit more to some portions (Pasta in particular) I always eat it up and ask for a little more bread to fill completely up before I get dessert for my second stomach ^_^ Great Place!"}
{"text":"Being an Italian from New York, I am extremely picky when it comes to this type of food. I went here with some family once, and the owner actually walked around to check on every table. Our family ended up talking to him, in italian, because he was born in the same town as a few family members of mine.   They are extremely nice, food is outstanding and from what I remember, he gets his fish for the restaurant fresh to make sure that the flavor is the best it can possibly be. Its tough to find good fish in the desert, but this place will not let you down!"}
{"text":"Went on Xmas Eve with friends at the last minute. Called for a reservation and said ok I will take the reservation at 8, the hostess says to me \"you gonna show up'? ??? Uh Yeah....Get there and of course I had to make a snarky comment that in fact we did show up. While the food was good didnt think it was the best Italian as others have said. When the waiter asked if I wanted parmesan cheese he didnt ask my friend so I asked if he would like some. The waiter then preceded to tell me that they dont put parm on that dish (clams and pasta) but he would and hope Gaetano wasnt looking. As a foodie I know that big name chefs dont put parm on fish but I didnt think we were at Spago or Mario Batalis. This is not an upscale place but I think it wants to be. It tries hard to be something its not."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough of Vegas restaurants.  I had a groupon that brought me into Gaetano's and it reminded me of being in an Italian restaurant in Boston or New York city.  The wine list was fantastic and they had an extensive traditional Italian menu with lots of seafood, veal, and pastas.    We ordered the special Bresola and the Veal Ossobucco, as well as a cold appetizer platter with various italian meats and pickled vegetables.  The food was good and definitely classic Italian.    The owner came over 3 or 4 times to ask how everything was to ensure we had a great service experience.  I will definitely be returning to Gaetano's."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place somewhat randomly while visiting Las Vegas. We stayed at the M. Resort to be off the strip (she's there a ton for work) and just cruised around Henderson on Yelp looking for Italian food. Gaetano's did not disappoint. It's not your spaghetti-and-meatballs-red-sauce place (though I'm guessing you can get it).  My pasta was perfectly cooked, the dish was interesting: gnocchetti (tiny little shells) with little sausages and broccoli rabe in a light garlic sauce. It was light and rich at the same time. The portion size was perfect. I didn't feel like I ate a manatee. The bread wasn't great, but it's a small issue. We had their house cabernet and it was excellent...just a hint of fruitiness and really smooth (I called it buttery, but \"smooth\" is probably a better word).  Friendly, helpful service, nice ambiance, nothing inventive. Listen, I'd love a brick building tucked away in some quiet downtown neighborhood with two dogs eating spaghetti out back, but I'm impressed that they've created a such a great restaurant right there in a strip mall."}
{"text":"A little pricey for the serving size, that said.. The most amazing gnocchi I have ever had!!!! And I choose gnocchi every time I can and this is by far the best I have ever had. Be ready to spend $30 Per person or more but def. try it!"}
{"text":"This was a little excursion I took with my best friend. Of course we had to sample all manner of appetizers and wines, because that's what best friends do when we're together. Plus we had almost the entire dining room to ourselves, so the service was impeccable.   The calamari was fantastic and came with a side of marinara. Amy would only eat the rings, but I ate the full small calamari and thought it was great. She said the little ones with all the tentacles freak her out. It was lightly breaded with what seemed like partially cornmeal and crispy fresh. I debated that the small ones were more tender. We then divided the plate so she had all the rings and I have the tiny tentacles, and we were good.   The fried zucchini blossoms stuffed with goat cheese was my favorite. Amy doesn't like goat cheese, so I ate them all quickly and efficiently while she munched on mussels. We both enjoyed the artichoke hearts, and the lemon sauce was light and complimented the dish nicely.  Next came the special, a buffalo mozzarella with fresh arugula and tomato. This was also very good with a sweet balsamic, but there wasn't much of it, so it went fast amidst our conversation about \"what if they made cheese from milking buffaloes\". Our server wasn't terribly impressed, but she was sweet and gracious. And more wine ensued...   Amy is a fan of Merlot, and picked up a bottle. I like Riesling. I like a sweet German Riesling to be exact. They had my second favorite on tap, Chateau St. Michelle. It's crisp and sweet and was pleasant with our selections. It was a fun night with great food and fun conversation. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"If they treat Groupon users like this why do they use it. We went with 5 people,two had purchased Groupon coupons.luckily we mentioned we would like 2 separate checks as we will be using groupons.The waiter informed us the policy was one per table.We asked to see management to hopefully explain we were unaware of restrictions. To our dismay an ARROGANT Woman without introducing herself MARCHED over to deal with the HOMELESS PEOPLE.Without giving us a chance to explain She informed us the limits were clear.Her contempt for our thinking that We could split up to use .another table for 3. She informed us we came in as one group. Loudly suggesting we may want to leave now.WE DID NEVER TO RETURN. We will rethink Groupon if this is the treatment. Instead of trying new places at a discount we will avoid being treated as destitute people looking for a free meal. Her disdain and contempt for coupon users was palpable.DO NOT patronize this establishment unless you enjoy being berated by condescending people"}
{"text":"place is awesome.. just tell them what you like and let them figure it out.. it works well.  If you're really picky.. just go to a strip casino buffet instead."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for $20 for $40 and thought this place was still good. No wonder they had a groupon as this place was not like it was before. Place was empty on a Friday night! After reading the reviews of this place further (after our meal) expect to be seated towards the back by the bathrooms if you have a kid. The food was ok, i had the arugula salad and lasagna. I now wonder why my lasagna  was so tiny.  I felt like I was eating a creme brûlée because they put it literally in one of those baking dishes for a creme brûlée. I want to say only 2 layers and watery.  That's probably because I told them I had a groupon before we ordered. Darn! Keep it quiet until you pay!!! Service was good for the most part, probably because there were like 5 tables there! I could tell our server had a cold. His nose was dripping while he explained the specials! Germs! Yuck!!!  The best part of it at the end, the owner lady came rushing towards our table like a mad woman and basically tossed our check on the table. Like she was pissed that we had a groupon. Wow! Not the first I see as I read prior reviews of this. Trust me, go to carrabbas instead, more for your money!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Went in to this restaurant with my pregnant wife and I.  As I told them table for two I saw plenty of open tables, the owner/manager then told me \"you two can sit at the bar not in the restaurant\".  I then asked him why is that and his response was \"if you don't like it you can leave\" .  Never been so disrespected in my life.  But thankfully I went to Delmonicos at the strip were my money was appreciated"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Our waiter, a very nice guy, failed to tell us all of the specials for the night.   After ordering, we overhead the waiter at the next table advising of the specials which included 3 dishes that we were not advised of.   Both my wife and I would have ordered one of the specials not mentioned if we had heard about them.  When our food was delivered, my wife's order was incorrect.   Once it was brought out correctly, the owner says to her you didn't ask for gluten free pasta.   Her response was Yes, I did, it was clearly stated to the waiter.  The waiter even went into to confirm with the chef and then repeated the order back to her correctly.   I then told the owner about not hearing about 3 of the specials and he storms back into the kitchen to yell at someone.   However, he never came back to apologize to us, offer to fix our meal or offer an alternative meal.  Obviously, there is a management problem with this place.   The food was just OK, nothing special.   We will not be going back, nor will we recommend this place to any of our friends.   Its unfortunate when a place has an opportunity to impress you with the service recovery and a few simple words but they don't know how."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. Nick is always friendly and remembers returning customers."}
{"text":"We have been to Gaetano's several times.  It's amazing, but pricey.  Look for a Groupon or Restaurant.com coupon to help defray the cost.  Zach was our favorite server too (like Sarah said), but he quit to go back to school.  Server this last time (who didn't give his name) was very knowledgeable, but not much personality.  The food is amazing though!  We had the baked artichoke appetizer.  My wife had the Fettuccine Alfredo, which was with homemade noodle and it was good.  The real winner was my homemade sausage ravioli, which was sublime.  Only the somewhat snooty service and high prices keep this place from 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent Place for Itialian food!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Love their basket of bread! The texture, the taste; simply perfect! All the servers were very pleasant and the interior decor is warm and cozy. My chicken  ravioli with pesto sauce was tender yet some chewiness-just how I like it!"}
{"text":"We've always arrived without a reservation, but we have arrived shortly after their opening time of 5PM, and we've been seated immediately.   This is a gem of a place, located in a strip mall. You can dress up or down. We've been there when they've hosted wedding receptions, and it's just a lovely, warm inviting atmosphere.   We stumbled upon this place one evening, and we went back for our weekly date night for the next three weeks. The food is fabulous, the staff friendly, and the service???? Frankly, whoever is the manager of this place, note to you: Please, please, please start a \"Master Class\" at some local college to instruct other restaurants on how to properly take care of customers. You'd be so rich, it'd be crazy. Other nicer restaurants WANT to be what this place is.   They have staff who just serve water. Staff who just bring out meals, staff to send out bread, staff to refill drinks, of course a sommelier, a manager who goes to each table to inquire about the meal, and to offer suggestions and support. And the main wait staff??? They are crazy informed about each daily special, and they know that menu by heart. So, if you feel like something light? They can offer suggestions. Want something hearty? They have that too.   I love their ravioli with tomato sauce, very light. I love their homemade pasta with shaved tenderloin in a mushroom sauce. Divine. The half chicken is so moist and delicious, my 13 year old devoured the dish with abandon. Even the attention to detail regarding mashed potatoes is visually appealing. Go once, relax with a nice wine, and enjoy. You'll love it.  Or don't go, that's fine. That way, we can still get in without a reservation. :-)"}
{"text":"The owners lack human decency and respect for those who use coupons (groupons) and those who sit with a party and don't order from their menu.   I will never patronize this establishment again. I encourage everyone to look at the 1-star reviews, as there seems to be a pattern with the owners of Gaetano's. They are entitled and selfish."}
{"text":"I love the spumoni ice cream.  tiramisu is good too.  ordered also the  tortellini soup---it's ok  goat cheese salad ---decent  the daily special salmon stuffed crab is really good."}
{"text":"We were given a Groupon for $40 to this restaurant (which was going to expire this November) so we thought we'd give it a second chance.  We have been here before (maybe about a year ago) and weren't too impressed so we never came back.  Any how, below was our order:  -Appetizer: Brodetto $14.95 Clams and mussels, sautéed with garlic and served in a white wine and spicy tomato broth with garlic toast  I have to admit although it was pretty skimpy on the clams and the mussels, the broth was delicious.  It had a tad spicyness to it and was creamy with a hint of basil.  Almost reminded me of a hearty tomato soup.  -Entree #1: Rolatine di Melanzane alla Siciliana $16.95 Grilled eggplant stuffed with angel hair pasta in a fresh tomato sauce, topped with mozzarella cheese and bake  This was also good.  You get 3 pasta stuffed eggplants covered in fresh tomato sauce.  Again, the tomato sauce was yummy.  Had a tad sweetness to it kinda like spaghetti-o's...lol!  The eggplant was lightly battered (maybe pan fried, rolled then baked).  -Entree #2: Gnocchetti Sardi $19.95 Gnocchetti Pasta with olive oil, garlic, sausage and broccoli rabbi  We were disappointed with this dish.  The broccoli rabbi was over cooked resulting in a very bitter taste.  This broccoli is suppose to be slightly bitter; however having it overcooked resulted in an increase in the bitterness.  The pasta was slightly overcooked as it seemed quite chewy and The sausage was average. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I would really give this place 5 stars but there was some confusion with their restaurant.com and Nick's Sunday/Monday wine specials. The coupon is $25 off $50 in food purchase. Great, easily done, my dish alone cost $50. We spent over $100 in food. We got a bottle which normally was $40 and was on sale for $22. Now, none of this would have been an issue if someone had told us that we couldn't get it for that sale price with the coupon, period. No putting it off on it's own check, no nothing, even with over $100 worth of food.  So when I got the check with a $40 dollar bottle of wine that retails for $10 at Total Wine. I was not overly happy. Sever said there was nothing to do. I just wish someone had warned me about this prior since I would have stuck with cocktails (which sounded like drinks to write home about) and not the wine.  Here is the good now: Nick has the bombastic mustache. Our server Jacob was fantastic as well, some of the best and most prompt service I have gotten in Vegas in a long while. All that was missing was a crumber. Haha. The food was divine, we got the bordetto mussel app, the broth was flavorful and even good to dip bread in. I got the veal osso buco with risotto. This was done to perfection, the risotto was cooked fantastically and the marrow of the bone was delish. My boyfriend got the ciopinno special and he loved it as well. Hats off to the chef!  Will I be back? I dunno. For the food and service, sure but not with a coupon apparently."}
{"text":"Out of town on business looking for a place close to my hotel for a nice dinner. Tripped up on this little gem and totally felt welcome as a single woman dining out. I have the special of the evening and it was fantastic. Wine selection was nice however if you were a white wine drinker you might find selections limited. Service was very attentive. A bit pricey compared to other Italian restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"Bought the current Groupon and was excited to try this much \"talked about\" restaurant. Needless to say I was thoroughly disappointed. The hostess greeted me and asked how many in my party? I answered four, two adults, two children. After finding out my children were young, she asked me if I would like to be put in a corner. I promptly responded,  \"No, why?\" She said, \"Well kids run around, scream, and can be disruptive.\" I said, \"Well, my kids behave so I'm not really worried.\" Then, if that wasn't enough, she stated, \"I just don't want you to be embarrassed.\" Oh my! That was just the beginning. The waiter, Angel, was condescending and did not offer any help when it came to the kids' selections. We ended up paying $16.00 per plate for spaghetti yet the adult portion was $18.95. Talk about a big rip off! We ended up paying $20.00 per child which included drinks. There was a gentleman circulating amongst guests but never said boo to us. The food was not extraordinary as previous reviews have stated. There are many Italian restaurants to be insulted and eat marginal food! We will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"So i decided to stop here for a late night meal with a friend after a workout anout 40 min before they closed. First look in i realized i wasnt dressed properly but a server sat us anyways after giving us the are u serious look wearing jean shorts and a fight hoodie in here... lol I liked our server Danny even though we could tell he wasnt excited to be getting a table this late but he gave us a great menu rap, accent and all. I appreciated his enthousiasm even if it was a little forced. We ordered a glass of wine and a beer and they dropped off bread service for us. Bread was a bit tasteless and not exciting. 3  different types but pretty plain. When our food came out i was happy with my spagetti and meatballs, (was craving carbs after workout) good flavor and just enough sauce for me. The spagetti noodles where done perfect as well. She ordered the bolangese and enjoyed it but likes more sauce with her pasta. Daniel came to check on us and she said she was fine but he could tell she wasnt really happy so he asked her whats up and she mentioned she likes more sauce in here pastas but it was no big deal. He told her to hold on a moment and he would take care of it and moments later they sent out a small dish of piping hot sauce. No attitude or problems, just answers. That impresses us both the most. He didnt sacrifice service because of how late it was or how we were dressed. We will definetly be back just based on service and how good our entree dishes were. Great all around experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there yesterday (A Monday) and sat at the bar for drinks and dinner.  We decided to go at an earlier time than usual and we got there about 20 mins after opening.   Mr Gaetano greeted us as we entered and asked if we would like a table or sit at the bar, we sat at the bar and was greeted by Alex (a new barman) who was very friendly and knowledgeable of the drinks and menu. We had a scampi appetizer which was cooked perfectly in a lemon and pepper sauce, it was fantastic, at no point did we feel rushed to order something else we just sat and chatted at the bar while Alex stopped by only to refill our glasses. Our main course arrived, my wife had the cheese filled ravioli and the pasta was wafer thin and tasted great.  I had the Penne with Bolognese which was fantastic, the pasta was cooked perfectly and the Bolognase gravy was to die for. All in all a great experience, we had been before but kinda forgot about it, now we have been again it will be one of our regular spots to have a nice early dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a date night and had some of the best Italian food we have ever had!!! I had the clam pasta and wanted to drink the sauce it was so good!! We also had the creme brule, and it was the best I have ever had. Awesome service and welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food in Vegas. Really has a NY feel and the atmosphere in here is perfect for dates!"}
{"text":"While in Las Vegas for business, a friend recommended this restaurant. Loved it! Food was great, service was first-class, and the atmosphere was very relaxing and quiet (a welcome diversion from the loud sights and sounds of Vegas).   The waiter was informative about the menu and very helpful in making our choices amongst all the great-sounding meals. There are familiar dishes on the menu...and some very unique as well. I had a creamy pumpkin soup (with the spices just right), and fish cooked perfectly with a light, yet flavorful sauce. The wines were varied, and my very affordable Cabernet was rich and smooth.   This is the type of restaurant, that if I lived nearby, I can see it becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!!!!!!! It was my gf 's birthday and she wanted some fresh homemade pasta.  I did a little research and found Gaetano's on Yelp. They make their own Fettuchini and ravioli. I believe they may also make some other noodles but I'm not sure.   We were seated with one of the best waiters we've had in quite some time. His name is Jake. He was very knowledgable about the menu and helped us to make some selections which enabled us to try a number of different items from the menu without having to order 3-4 dinners. He also was pretty funny and made us laugh.   On to the food..... We ordered the grilled portabello mushroom appetizer which had a great smokey grilled taste and just the right amount of cheese. Delicious!!!! Next came our caesar salad for 2. The homemade caesar dressing is perfect. The appetizers and salads were also served with a lovely warm bread assortment with olive oil and balsamic vineger to dip into. Our main couses arrived a short time later...............Cioppino with homemade fettucini noodles and an order of assorted homemade ravioli. We also got a meatball on the side.   Gaetano and his wife both came by our table to be sure all was well and we were enjoying our meals. That's rare and much appreciated when the owners of a restaurant care enough to make contact with their customers.  This was a great first visit to Gaetano's and everthing was fantastic.!!!!!!!!!!!  We will definitely be returning to Gaetano's again for dinner."}
{"text":"I brought my GF here for her birthday and I was not disappointed, First off the waiter was simply impressive and even cooler was that the house Manhattan was named after him and was a great drink. I had the special that night which was a pork dish and was fantastic, I have never heard of the dish but with the vegetables it was great. It came with gnocchi which I didn't feel like eating so they easily switched it out with pasta.  The fresh bread they serve is DELISH and the house salads are amazing. Oh and if you are not impressed that the server remembers 11 different daily specials on a daily basis then I do not know what to say."}
{"text":"This food is A-MA-ZING!  I love their lasagna and chicken parmigiana!  My husband gets rigatoni bolognese!  Their sauce is tasty with tang but not greasy.  The lasagna is made with a béchamel sauce rather than chunky ricotta, but I love it this way!   We order takeout and have a delicious homemade Italian meal!"}
{"text":"Little underwhelming for the prices and portion size The mussels were just as expensive as Maestros and there wasn't anything in the shell tiny mussels not enough  Shells were cracked wrong when they were opened  I let the waiter know and he didn't show any interest  I almost broke a tooth on the shell  The manager went over to every table except ours it was our anniversary and the bill was big for not getting full  Chicken parm was like 27.00  Here's a good joke chicken parm you didn't taste so good lol  1st and Italian restaurant I've left still hungry  They think they're upscale problem is they're not  I gave it 2 stars because the servers buss boys were attentive  The waiter Angel was rude and obnoxious  I will look for another Italian restaurant in the area to enjoy not impressed ....."}
{"text":"Everything about Gaetano's was amazing. Jacob - our server - was very relaxed, professional, full of great suggestions & an over really nice guy.  The food was delightful. From the selections of breads to the fettuccine, it was everything we hoped for & more.  Thank you for an amazing evening. Jacob was fantastic & we very much look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  We went because we had been before and had a good experience, but this was definitely not the case this time.  When we received our order we realized that one of the dishes was not what we expected.  Also the Penne Pasta with Vodka sauce also was almost impossible to eat because it was too salty.  We spoke to the waiter and the owner came over.  He was insistent that this was how it was and cared less about what we were saying.   He was rude and obnoxious.  He will never have our business again!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is beautiful....dimmed lights, Italian themed soft music playing, comfortable seating with clean tables. Service was very tentative. But the food was just average at best. Nothing memorable. And I've been here twice before I decide to write this review. Only reason why we decide to give Gaetano's a second chance was because of that soon to expire Groupon.  With my first visit, I got a pasta dish with just straight up pesto sauce. Gross. So yesterday evening....I got the Rigatoni Alla Bolognese-pasta with homemade meat sauce. It was a safe choice but really just A-OK. Sadly...it tasted like a Lean Cuisine frozen dinner. =/ However, my boyfriend really enjoyed his crusted seabass entrée with a side of meat sauce penne. The fish was fresh and that wine sauce was pretty good. This was part of the 5+ specials for the night.  Maybe third times the charm? Until then....three stars it is.  But I will update this review (hopefully bump up instead of bump down) if we ever go back here again. I would like to try the Chicken Piccata. Although...there's another really good Italian restaurant close by. *ahemmontesano*"}
{"text":"This place is a piece of crap. First of all, me and my wife are in our early 70's, don't drink alcohol, and we can not eat a lot of food. So, we came with a coupon that was buy one entree, get the second entree for half price. The food is good, no complaint there. Then when we were presented with the check, the waiter did not add the coupon, so the owner came to the table and said, \"You people come here with a coupon, you don't eat an appetize, you didn't even drink any wine....don't ever come back to my place again.\"  I have never been treated so badly by anyone, anywhere, ever. Then, the owner followed us out to the parking lot yelling at us and once again, said, \"Get the FU%& out of here and don't ever come back.\" You simply can not make this stuff up. Countless people I know who have dined here have gotten a very cold and rude experience as well. Below, they describe the wife who is like a gate keeper. SHAME ON THE OWNER FOR TREATING PEOPLE SO BADLY. IF YOU TREATED PEOPLE WITH RESPECT, YOU WOULN'T HAVE TO GIVE OUT COUPONS TO BRING PEOPLE THROUGH YOUR DOOR. ALSO, IF YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE USING GROUPONS OR COUPONS, STOP OFFERING THEM. THESE PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ambiance and decor of the place. We ordered the Venison steak special for $38, the pasta figoli, and crab cake, and then the Chicken Parmesan.   I really wanted to like the place because it would be nice to have off the strip options for a decent meal but I have to say that it was underwhelming. The food itself was not bad but it wasnt anything special either. I think some more imagination and flavor would go a long way.   Worse than that, the portion sizes were just small. $12 for a crab cake appetizer, I'd expect to see two crab cakes not just one little one in the middle of the plate.   My venison dish was fine but only maybe 4 or 5 slices (small slices) of Venison on top of a scoop of Risotto? For $38? To me that's even worse than strip prices. Maybe it was that way for Valentine's Day but shocking as it is, it's much better value for the money to go down to Buddy V's or to Maggiannos and the food at either place is much better, too."}
{"text":"FANTASTICO!!  awesome fresh warm bread, flavorful calimari! I had the chicken ravioli with pesto sauce and my only complaint is that I wanted more I never wanted it to end! Oh and their terimisu wow dont even get me started I dont think I opened my eyes the whole time i was eating it from how beautifuly orgasmic it was...the atmosphere was great, family vibe and super authentic italian staff, definitely going back no doubt :D"}
{"text":"Went for valentine day but not sure if it was because of the constricted and specially selected menu that we were not able to experience the full bit of Gaetano's offerings.  We were limited to certain items and I gravitated to pasta while the hubs wanted steak. Steak in an Italian place...hm not such a great idea I feel.  Service was very slow, i expected better staffing on this special day.  We sat at a corner with two tables and water finally came after a good 5 minutes.  Took a longer time to get bread and then everything was pretty much acceptable once entree arrived.  Bread was SO delicious....so soft, warm, crunch on the side but not too hard.  Loved it.  The only gripe....the balsamic vinegar. Was it stuck to the bottom of bowl? Olive oil was good but that balsamic adds flavor and I had to dig out the balsamic with my bread, the most work I had to do while dressed up with perfectly manicured nails.  That darn balsamic...all that scraping and that's all I got!  It was worth it though once I got it because that bread was ust divine.  The pasta with mushroom and filet tasted well, very creamy and I was filled just with about three or four fork fulls.  I equated it to Beef Stroganoff with much better flavoring when pepper added.  I would order again, but prepare to box it home. So very rich and creamy.  The steak was dry. We asked for medium and it was cooked medium well...more on the dry side.  I enjoyed the mash and spinach very much...which is quite odd since the steak should have been the highlight.  We had to mix the mash with meat to palate it down.    Let's redeem with creme brulee and we were so disappointed.  The consistency was rough, it was oozing out and we were basically slurping creme brulee vs. having a nice firm dollop on spoon.  We didn't complain since they seemed so busy and we were not sure if we would return....so it's on to another venue to relive how creme brulee should taste like..  I think they took it out too early from fridge (the oozing part) and the preparation of custard was not well executed (hence the grainy texture of the creme). Thank goodness for a nice crackle of sugar on top..that was perfectly fired."}
{"text":"Met my friend who had a Groupon. I just moved to Henderson & want to find new spots & this was a perfect way to test the waters. The food was fabulous...we shared 2 specials...Chilean sea bass & rolled pork...both were great! The portions were huge!  Our waiter was wonderful...had fun talking to him as he was from Michigan originally as both of us...all in all well be back!!! Can't wait to have that sea bass again!!! Delish!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would try a new restaurant. This place was a huge let down! Owners walk around patrolling the waiters and stopping at only select tables. Food was meh. Caesar salad tasted like bagged salad. Pasta was over cooked and tastes like boxed pasta. Funny the only time the lady owner came to our table was to collect the check. I overheard her telling one of the waiters not to give anything extra only what's on the table. I assumed she was talking about us since we asked for extra bread and oil. She is very rude. The food is way overpriced and taste more like Olive Garden. Menu is boring. I see why only a few tables were filled on a Friday night. Save your money! Way better options in Henderson!"}
{"text":"We were first introduced to this restaurant through some good friends and have returned time and time again since then. We just celebrated our 3rd Anniversary here and hope to keep visiting for all our special occasions. This family owned and operated Italian restaurant is amazing. Everyone is extremely friendly and treats everyone as if they've known you forever. The owner, Gaetano Palmeri, is always walking around to ask if your dining experience is good and will even go over the daily specials personally. His family is very nice and you can't find a better personality than, Danny! The food is amazing! The Seafood/Pasta special (I always forget the name...) is my favorite. The Crab stuffed Salmon, Stuffed Lamb Chop and veal are awesome too. The have a great wine list and also host a monthly wine dinner pairing that is great. It's not Olive Garden or Carrabbas, so expect to pay a little more but it won't break you."}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday -   What a wonderful experience!  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming.  The service was impeccable and the owner stopped by our table a time or two to make sure everything was all right.  The food was out of this world (from the bread, main course and dessert).  We will definitely be going back.  Thank you to everyone @ Gaetano's Ristorante for making my husbands birthday memorable..."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Portion sizes were perfect for the price. Not a place for children."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant. It is a beautiful place. The service was very good Jake was our waiter and he did a good job. However the salads that we had were little bit on the small side as portions go. I had filet mignon with the homemade noodles .The homemade noodles were very good but it didn't taste like filet mignon and the meat was overdone and it looked like ground beef. We ordered artichoke hearts they were the worst artichoke hearts I've had in my life. Artichoke hearts and not supposed to have leaves attached to them and ours did. I told the waiter and he quickly blamed it on the new guy in the back. I told him it's not the new guy in the back it's whoever trained him is the problem."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon, got $40 for $20. Meal was fine, restaurant was a little empty. Service so-so, we waited a long time for our server to take our order. Lasagna made from fresh pasta - delicious but fresh pasta makes the lasagna more \"soft\" and \"mushy\" - missing the bite of al dente from dried pasta. Fresh pasta with 3 Ps had amazing flavor of porcini. It's an incredibly rich dish.   Creme Brûlée spot on.   Prices are expensive, not sure if go there again without the Groupon."}
{"text":"The best Italian food in the Valley!  You must try the Special Cap drink, yum!  Ray is the best bartender, he is so polite and attentive."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMM!!! thats all i have to say about this place. i could say for a Saturday night they could have a bit more servers working, but it acutally ended up working out. cuz with all the food we ordered the time it took for it to come out was just the right amount to let us rest in between.  sooo good, will def be back!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Gaetanos since it opened. It's truly one of the BEST Italian restaurants I've had the privilege to enjoy many times. We have been dining there for so long, we have become friends with the owners. The service is truly impeccable every time. They have daily gourmet specials, along with the regular authentic Italian menu. Their food is always very good. I also love their occasional tasting dinners. The prices are very reasonable. Make it a point to dine here, even if you're just visiting. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time on a Friday night.   I came with my mom, husband, and my toddler. I would definitely say that this is a great date night place, but not really for young families! We had great service until our food arrived, then our server kind of went missing.   The owners (I assume) were very kind and came around asking how things were and were awesome! My husband went outside with our son and the owner took my husbands food to the kitchen and reheated it for him.   No kids menu available here.   They did bring out the food quickly though!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. The service and the food is impeccable. Never disappoints. The 3 P's is to die for also the pappardelle fillete. Gaetano greets you as if you were a regular."}
{"text":"GREAT Food!  GREAT Service!  Have been here before and have always enjoyed our experience.  Figured I might as well Yelp about this time.  Had Dinner last night... it was pretty empty ... 3 other tables were sat when we got there... of course, one table did have 10 people at it.  Ambience:  Quiet (unless there's a party of 10 whooping it up next to you)... can be Romantic / Intimate with the low lighting...white table cloths and stealthy servers Not Fancy... but Not Casual...   We had brought our own bottle of Prosecco to enjoy at the beginning of the meal and to toast my Mom's b-day.  I think the corkage fee was $15.  They immediately brought out Chilled Flutes and a bucket filled with ice to keep our wine cold....and they continued to refill our glasses til the wine was gone.  :)    We ordered the Bruschetta to start.... Pretty good... because the tomatoes were juicy... the bread got soggy.  Not the best Bruschetta I've ever had but it was good... give it 3 stars.  My mom and I split the Arugula salad (with goat cheese, pear slivers and candied pecans and a light champagne vinigarette).   5 stars Perfect portion to split as we wanted a salad but didn't want a BIG salad to start.  Very tasty... fresh arugula and the the goat cheese was melt in your mouth perfect.  I ordered the Special Stuffed Veal Chop... WOW!  WOW!  WOW!   5 stars! It was D-LISH!  And the veal chop was HUGE.  I didn't finish it... took half home.  It was served with parmesan risotto of which... I took 1/2 of that home too. The chop was stuffed with parm, broccoli rabe, italian sausage and served in their Marsala sauce... SO GOOD!  Mom ordered the Crab Stuffed Salmon which was served on a bed of rice pilaf, sliced carrots and zucchini. I got a taste of hers and it was Very Good... but I liked my stuffed Veal Chop better. I'd give hers 4.5 stars because I liked mine better.  The husband ordered the Special Pappardelle pasta with Filet Mignon and Shittake mushrooms in a Creamy Marsala sauce.  I got a taste of this too... WOW!  Definitely 5 stars! It was rich and so much flavor. The shittake really added another dimension to the dish... of flavor and depth. I really liked his but was enjoying my veal so much that I didn't switch with him... although... I thought about it. Sadly, he ate ALL of his dinner so I don't get his leftovers.  Because it was Mom's b-day... they brought out Tiramisu.   YUMMMMM! 5 stars Light... Creamy.... Rich.  Not overly soaked in coffee ... and Not overly sugar-y.... One of the best Tiramisu's I've had.  My favorite is still the one at Celini's in New York but this one makes top 5.  Will I go back?  YES!"}
{"text":"I use Groupon to find restaurants every where I travel, even in my own city (there's so many) this one is a gem! The waiter Alex was nice & extremely professional! His knowledge of the menu was awesome and the way he described the selections made you want to try everything! We looked at the menu & had our meals picked, but when Alex returned he gave us the rundown of the daily specials, it changed everything! My son ordered the duck came with butternut ravioli, I ordered the sausage ravioli in mushroom sauce, both dishes were delightful! The whole dinner starting with the variety of hot breads to dessert was so delicious & the tiramisu don't skip it, melts in your mouth! We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great authentic Italian food. This is the place Every meal has been fantastic. Reasonable priced Great service Very clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been there for Valentines' Day and loved it. So we jumped at a Groupon offer and reserved for this past Saturday night - a couple we know well wanted to takes us for a birthday dinner. We gave them our Groupon to ease the cost a bit. My husband asked about using the Groupon - which apparently was a mistake because the attention we got vanished.  We received our soups and salads quickly as well as the bread baskets. All good. But then we started to wait. We asked for another bread basket - we were brought burnt bread. Awhile went by and asked for another - we were having good conversation and didn't really notice the time. Second basket even worse. It occurred to me - how long has it been? Turned out it had been 45 minutes since the salad. No wonder we were hungry! I mentioned it to my tablemates. They said they were sure the entree wiuld be served soon. Five minutes later, I noticed people who came in after us were eating. I went to the hostess and asked. She checked and said, \"It will be soon now. He forgot to put in the order and it had just been fired\". So we would have just sat there all night if I hadn't said something. It didn't occur to anyone that we were sitting there with NO FOOD and there might be something wrong. The hostess said they would give us free desserts. I didn't want their dessert, I like to go to Cream for ice cream. My group, though, said okay. The entrees were very tasty, my friend loved the mezzaluna and we liked our pasta. After the meal, my husband said we would just have two desserts and asked what they had on offer. No, the hostess told us, they would bring something out. One cheesecake, one tiramisu. Everybody in our group hates coffee flavor, only one liked the cheesecake. It was weird - if they were trying to make it up to us, shouldn't we have been asked what we wanted to have? For the record, we tip on the full amount of the meal, not the discounted price, since we are retired from the restaurant business. This was obviously not everyone's experience, but it was ours. The level of hostility from the crew was palpable as we left, like it was OUR fault. Maybe because they still had more burnt bread in the kitchen they wanted to get rid of."}
{"text":"Updated to include dinner New Year's Eve at Gaetano's.   The Ossobuco was absolutely  fantastic.   Very tender, very flavorful and of course the marrow is the crowning glory.   Missed the traditional gremolata (garlic/parsley/lemon zest sprinkled over the shanks) but other than that it was perfect.  It was served over pasta, but again being the traditionalist when it comes to Ossobuco I asked for and got Risotto Milanese and it too was perfect.   Two others in my group ordered the same and they loved it. I love that the owner always makes it a point to talk to the patrons and maybe josh with them a little.  He always makes himself visible and available and if you need anything, or make substituions he's there and ready to accomodate. Nice touch."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit last night and we had a party of 10 for a birthday.  I was very impressed with the food on my first visit, all except for the Caesar Salad (did not care for the dressing) on the first visit.  But the food was amazing.  Our service was perfect....and everyone had very positive comments on the food.  For me...this is one of the best and most authentic Italian Restaurants in Las Vegas, and if you know the family history, they used to be in Calabasas before coming to Las Vegas in I believe 2002.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.   When I read the review from a Colleen F stating that she thought Carrabba's was cheaper with more flavor....I had to laugh and think to myself...poor girl has no idea what beautiful Italian food is all about.   It was like comparing a Pinto to a Mercedes.  I cannot wait to go back there again!"}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviews, I took advantage of the Restaurant.com offer.  You get $50 off but need to spend $100.    My advice is to wait when they offer 80 or 90% off the Restaurant.com offer.  Normally you can get the $50 coupon for $20 but they offer discounts and then you can get it for just a couple bucks.  Onto the review....  I love this place because of the food and service.  You really feel at home and it does not feel stuffy.   The owner comes by and talks to you about the dishes and gives every table attention.    We ordered  the following:  Carpaccio di manzo con arugula - Thin slices of raw beef tenderloin with arugula, parmesan cheese, and EVOO.  This was very light and fresh.  Butternut squash Ravioli with Brown butter and Sage  - Very fresh...pasta had that nice bite in texture and the sauce was the boss.  You can also order a smaller portion which is what we did so these were our 2 apps.  Branzino Served Tableside - This was one of the off-the-menu items.  As stated in previous reviews, the restaurant typicaly has 8-10 daily specials.  I recommend def ordering one of them up.  The fish was simple but fresh and good.  A little lemon, EVOO brings out the freshness and taste of the fish.    Ossobucco served on saffron risotto - the best dish i ve had in months.  so much flavor and you can tell some old lady's been slaving away cooking it in a dutch oven to get all the nice, juicy flavor.  You don't need a knife for the shank and it's so rich but worth it.  The risotto is perfectly cooked.  To round it out, we ordered a side of broccoli rabe, tiramisu (awesome!), coffee, and with tax and tip we were out the door for just under $80.  For the quality of food and service, the meal would have been close to $200 on the strip, but with the coupon we had a great time for a very reasonable price.  We'll be back fo sure!"}
{"text":"Gaetano's has a very pleasant and relaxing atmosphere.   The staff was very knowledgeable of menu items and provided good service.    I ordered the asparagus risotto special.  The risotto was delicious and well seasoned.  The restaurant could have stepped it up a little and put a garnish of grilled asparagus or something to make the dish visually appealing.   My husband had the rolled pork special.  The flavor was OK.  He gave me a bite of the pork.  You could hardly taste the pork as it was overwhelmed by the amount of bread stuffing inside.  The sauce should have been nappe and it was overly thick.  This was a little disappointing which is why we took away one star.  Overall though, it was a good experience and we would probably go back.  The restaurant was a  little pricey for the quality of food served."}
{"text":"So not really Italian....and soooo overpriced and the atmosphere is almost non-existent....parking is horrible....using a voucher from Restaurant.com takes a bit of the bite of how not wonderful this place is.  The owner circulate among the guests but only talk to their croonies.  I live in Henderson NV where this restaurant is."}
{"text":"This ristorante boasts very good food with a few unique dishes that set it apart from the usual Italian fare. From the obligatory pre-meal bread to the delightful dessert cappucino, everything was fresh, tasty, and interesting. The service, setting, and presentation were all excellent as well. Though a little pricey, I would definitely recommond this place for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Great Italian place! Cozy and romantic ambience with top notch service! Chicken Parm and Picatta were excellent! Nice bread and impressive wine list by the bottle or glass."}
{"text":"Food was super delicious!  Our waiter Zack was awesome.  He gave great suggestions on the stuffed figs wrapped in prochutt.  We finished our meal with Gaetanos special espresso which was the perfect ending.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for many years now and I cannot tell you how upset and surprised we were with the treatment we received last night. My family and I live in Las Vegas so taking the time to drive to this place should tell you how much we used to enjoy going there, however last night when greeted by the owner at the entrance, we will never go back and will absolutely spread the word on how this man operates.  As we entered at 6pm we noticed only two patrons in the place they were at the bar.  The owner greeted us and promptly proceeded to offend  us from there on out.  We had our 6 month old sleeping baby with us in his car seat and the owner when going to seat us walked us through the bar area which is rather narrow and put us directly in the back of the restaurant to the side of the doors of which there was one lone table. Now mind you the restaurant was totally empty,  except for the two people at the bar. We asked why were were being seated away from the main dining room, and in the back by the bathroom doors and he said because we had the baby.  He said I don't want crying kids and noisy things making noise and neither does anyone else.  I cannot tell you how rude this was not too mention discriminatory .  I have been to 5 star restaurants every where and have never been treated so rudely. Not only was the baby sleeping but the restaurant was empty! We teach our children how to behave in restaurants from an early age, we always respect the feelings and wishes of other dinner patrons by walking outside with a crying child. How dare this man assume we are some sort of second class folk because we brought our baby with us.  We were humiliated and treated very poorly.  It was like a scene right out of 50s, you know like the times where people of color were segregated from whites because it was offensive to mingle the two together.     Needless to say we did not stay we just said no thanks and left he was all to happy to say bye.    Shame shame on this man for setting us back 70 years and not treating everyone as equals. We will never go back there no matter how the food tastes and I would hope that others do the same.   He himself is an immigrant and or an offspring of immigrant parents and should be mindful of everyone who lives here in this great country of the United States of America and stop discriminating against anyone of any type.   Bad for business Mr Gaetano I hope karma comes a knocking at your door with an iron fist!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Had stuffed veal with parmesan risotto, fried artichokes with a pesto sauce. A-freaking-mazing. Papa- the owner was very wonderful with us."}
{"text":"I was very surprised that Gaetano's has another location other than in Torrance, Calif. So for those in Henderson, you are in for a wonderful treat. I HIGHLY recommend their \"Wild mushroom ravioli and tiramisu\", seriously heavenly!"}
{"text":"Gaetano's has AMAZING food! The service was great too. The owner waited on us and his wife worked at the door. I love that atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 9:17 and some stuck up old man tells us \" not sure if we have time to serve you..\" they close at 10.. After ordering our food bread shows up, be sure to have doubles there because the portions are very small! The food was nothing to write home about... save your money there are way better places out there with out the attitude.."}
{"text":"I don't venture down to Henderson much...by choice...but I am glad I met this girl in a coffee shop.  If I hadn't I would have missed a great Italian Restaurant.  The atmosphere is top notch.  Every place setting was perfectly laid out, and the tables were close enough to be intimate but not so close that you were rubbing elbows with strangers.  The calamari was tender and breaded to perfection.  The 75 dollar tasting menu with matching wines is exactly what all tasting menus should be.  Lots of food, thoughtfully prepared with exceptional ingredients.  The wines were exceptional and complimented the food to a tee.  Great for dates, romantic without being TOO romantic.  I say this is an excellent place for a group of adults, a first date or a married couple out for a nice meal but don't want to spend 150 a person.  The wait staff was attentive without being overbearing and they answered every question my date had.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow this place totally redeemed itself on this vist! I went with the boar Ragu I can't remember the Italian name for it but it was incredibly good as it was a daily special. As for the appetizer we got the antipasto platter which was loaded with sliced Meats cheeses and eggplant that was marinated. Service was on point and the ambience of the restaurant is really quite nice. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Of course the food is wonderful.  Beyond that, I just love how they treat me here, especially as a single lady dining alone. Talk about transformational service! And, my LivingSocial voucher made it doubly good!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner, they have great raviolis really enjoyed it great service would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"My family has been here before and they said it was amazing, so I figured I would try it with them! As soon as you walk in you feel \"at home\".  Very cozy and adorable layout! We were seated right away without any reservations which was great.  We were greeted very quickly and were given bread right away.  Their bread is baked fresh daily and you can definitely tell.  Our waiter told us the daily specials and they sounded delicious.    I had the fillet of Sole with a side of butternut squash ravioli ( my weakness) and my family had bolognese pasta, a spicy pasta, and veal parmesan.  Everything looked beautiful when it came out and their portions are very big and sharing sizes.  The fish was very fresh (which is rare lol no ocean)   Unfortunately I had room for dessert although they sounded so good!  I can't wait to come back to this restaurant and try new items off the menu.  One of the better italian places in Vegas off the strip!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience and the food was delicious! We met the owner, Gaetano and his son - they go out of there way to make an evening at their restaurant so warm and inviting, as if you're dining in their home. We're locals and it's one of our favorite hangouts. . . Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"We gave Gaetano's 2 tries. We thought the first time was a fluke. We were wrong. This time around, the service was below average and the food was nothing special. We could have spent less and had more flavor at Carrabba's. I ordered the lasagna. It was a nice size portion, but the sauce was very watery.  My husband ordered the special, chicken and asparagus risotto. It was extremely bland....we were trying to spice it up by scooping up my watered-down sauce onto it. We would have liked to try some fresh mozzarella or parmersean on it, but our server only checked on us about a minute after we got our food. We never saw him again until it was time for the check.   We really wanted to like this place since it's got a great ambiance and is so close to our house. But we won't be back."}
{"text":"I went here with a groupon on a Monday night and it was a ghost town. Idk y because this place was the bizzzz!!! My cioppino was perfect, my fiancé s vongole was delish,  the carppacio was divine.  They had great customer service and super helpful with the menu...I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"If you are ever in the area Gaetano's is a must! Worth the Uber trip from the strip.  The food was outstanding and the service impeccable. Family run place where quality and service is top rate."}
{"text":"My family went here for my Birthday this year, opting for something different than the usual 4 star strip restaurant we typically do to celebrate. I've had my eye on this place for awhile and it met every expectation, the staff was amazing and the food was even better. We all had something different and shared a bit of each others since everyone's food looked amazing! We also tried multiple appetizers which were also fantastic. It was late and we were the last patrons in the restaurant, no one attempted to rush us as we lingered and chatted and even opened gifts. Was a overall fabulous experience and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Definitely a change of pace from typical Italian Restaurants. Gaetano's has an excellent selection and nightly specials, prepared to perfection. Gaetano's has a wide variety of wines on their menu and something to go with anything!  The food is served hot and fresh. It is unique and delicious. Their seafood plates are outstanding, as well as the pasta dishes.  The service is five star! And the hospitality is fantastic. We are going there again tonight to celebrate my daughter's birthday. When asked where she wanted to go? She said \"Gaetano's!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is highly recommended! I always order gnocchi's with the Gorgonzola dressing delicious! The owner is always there very pleasant inviting place."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a nice ambiance, excellent food and stellar service.  It was even better that we had a groupon but it would have still been worth it without it!"}
{"text":"Ive given this place two chances now and find it hard to write much as the place is just so so. Ambience is lackluster. Food is average while wine menu isnt half bad (they do allow byob with modest corkage but check ahead of time bc they wont allow your bottle if its on their menu)."}
{"text":"Possibly the best family owned restaurant in Henderson. I continue to be impressed by their service and the quality of their food after all these years. They've got it right.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  From the ambience, service, food quality to the prices, it was fantastic.    Purchased on groupon and had 2 amazing plates, a glass of wine and some bread.  I will be back for sure.  My mother liked it very much and can't stop speaking about it."}
{"text":"This is a hidden jewel!  Small Italian restaurant with some great house specials.  I had the seabass which was light-flaky and buttery!  Delish!!!   Tip:  Make reservations!!!!  It small so seating is limited.  Dress is not formal but it inst casual either.  Great for date night!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place with a Groupon. We were the only two in the restaurant at 5:30. The menu in simple and limited, which is usually a good thing. I had the veal and my wife had butternut squash ravioli. My veal and pasta were good but I was overwhelmed with the amount of grease. My wife's really enjoyed her ravioli but the was nothing else on the plate. The service was pretty good. Almost too good. Every other sip of my drink, there was someone filling it up. We lost track of how many people were coming to our table. It was a bit much. The thing that upset me was the bill. We had a $40 Groupon and the bill was about $55. They added a group gratuity of almost ten dollars to the bill. I would have tipped way more than the $10 because that's what you do when you use a Groupon. When someone adds a tip because you use a coupon, that's their tip. Too bad for them. Overall a decent restaurant will decent service and food. This must not be a very popular restaurant if they are using Groupon and then telling money from their customers. I will not be returning to this establishment. Overall, an ok restaurant. Decent service and decent food. The price"}
{"text":"This is most possibly the best Italian food I have ever eaten . The staff is friendly.  It is a family owned  business and the food is phenomenal. Gaetano himself seats you and his beautiful wife greets you.  Well worth it . Best dining experience ever. Our waiter was a rock star very knowledgeable.  Went out of his way to make sure we had an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Great wine good pizza. Prices ok. I would recommend for dinner date. Loud at the bar, bartender nice and attentive."}
{"text":"First time at Gaetano's the other night and it was a pleasant surprise. This family run restaurant can trace its roots back to LA four decades ago. And the rich history shows in how this restauranteur and his family treat you from the moment you walk in to your departure. When I think of fine dining off the strip in Las Vegas, few places come to mind but Gaetano's is one.  The atmosphere is fantastic. Spacious, comfortable seating and a great vibe, you are relaxed and eager to experience the menu at Gaetano's. The bar is a good place to start with a cocktail or glass of wine. Once at the table Gaetano does a great job of walking you through the specials of the night, of which there were plenty. Before looking at the menu you already have several dishes you absolutely want to taste.  The menu itself is full of Italian classics - chicken parm, Osso Bacco, veal Milanese, and a host of amazing sounding pasta dishes. I went with the Osso Bacco served with Safran risotto. It was perfect. We started with the buffalo mozzarella which paired well with the home baked bread basket. The special Mediterranean salad was also very good, freshly prepared and seasoned tossed style.   Gaetano's food is exceptional however where he really demonstrates his high caliber cuisine is in the range and quality of his desert menu. One after another the selection is classic Italiano but prepared to Gaetano's family signature style. We ordered several deserts to share and they were fabulous.   I'm glad we came to Gaetano's. It's going to be a regular spot for me when looking to dine out in Henderson."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience ever the food was terrible and the service was horrible!  My wife and I went there and the owner told us off because we split a meal,  Furthermore, he told my wife and I to never come back, we are senior citizens and on a fixed income . The whole experience was absolutely awful, what kind of person chases after customers and says don't come back if you're going to split a meal."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment on April Fool's Day, 2013, to redeem a Groupon I had purchased over a year ago; needless to say, the promotional value had expired hehe  The decor and layout was upscale and I was instantly impressed.  I was seated at a corner table between the bar and the dining area which turned out to be a very high traffic area for the servers.  There were people flying behind me throughout the evening, putting orders in at the bar and returning with drinks.  I should have asked for a different seat.    I ordered the \"Trancia di Salmone alla Senape,\" (Pan seared filet of salmon with shallots and a dijon mustard sauce) which, if you're looking at the menu is the 2nd item at the top on a right hand page.  I pointed directly at the item I wanted and even attempted to pronouce it lol  (that was fun!)  10-15 minutes later, the server returns and states he forgot to ask how I wanted the meat prepared.  This should have been a red flag!  However, I was taken aback as I've never had anyone ask me how I'd like my salmon cooked.  I quickly replied, \"Well done.\"  He looked back at me, almost shocked, and asked, \"So you don't want any red in it?\"  I replied, definitely not.  15 minutes later or so, the server returns and apologizes for the wait, stating the meat takes longer to prepare well done.  I understood and was astonishingly patient.    My food finally arrives after 30 minutes or so, and I looked at the meat and it looked burnt.  I thought, \"Oh... this is what well done salmon looks like. \" I began to eat and noticed the meat was good but definitely WAS NOT fish.  I had no more than 3 bites and called the server back and politely asked, \"Is this salmon?\"  He replied, \"Oh, I thought you ordered the steak filet?\"  I quickly grabbed the menu and re-pointed to what I had previously ordered.  He asked if I wanted to keep the food as he went back to order what I had asked for.  I replied, \"No thank you\" and he took the filet mignon back.    Five minutes later, the owner is in my face.  He was rude and was like, \"How can you not tell the difference between salmon and steak?!  I mean, their two different kinds of meat!\"  He was pissed and I would be too however the fact that he came at me accusatory and rude left a hugely sour taste in my mouth.  He basically came across as if I had ordered one thing and then changed my mind once the food arrived.  What was brought to me was way at the bottom of the same page I ordered from so there should have been no confusion.  Had it not been for the server ADMITTING his fault, the owner would have continued to verbally assault me.  I should have been more embarrassed by the situation, but, as they walked away, all I could do was laugh because I knew I had nothing to do with the mix up.  It was the way the owner handled the situation that cemented my decision to never to eat at this establishment again, even though the food was delicious.  30 minutes later, my salmon arrived.    The icing on the cake was when they charged me AUTOGRATUITY, totalling $5.84.  The service certainly did not warrant such a tip and the fact that the owner made NO attempt to remedy the hour long wait for my food or his rudeness was beyond poor customer service.  In closing, if Groupon was giving away free $40 vouchers to eat at Gaetano's, I would, without question, have to decline.  Good food must never trump great service; and if the poor service I received that night was an April Fool's joke, I definitely was not amused!  You've been warned =)"}
{"text":"The owner of the restaurant and his wife were very rude and not accommodating.  The wife handed us the bill immediately after we finished our meal and didn't inquire whether we desired anything else. The waiter was puzzled as to the behavior of the owner's wife."}
{"text":"Our dinner last night was perfection!!!  Welcoming us the moment we set foot in the restaurant. Our waiter and his crew were totally in charge and anticipated all our needs. The food, well what can I say....  Super delicious and great presentation. What impressed me was before they brought our bill, we were asked if we were military or AARP members for senior discounts.   We didn't even ask. We were brought complimentary espresso and dessert!!!  THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FOOD. THANK YOU"}
{"text":"We were visiting friends in Las v\Vegas and they took us to their favorite restaurant - a place for special occasions. They were right!  I was told the homemade meatballs, made with filet mignon and veal,  were the best - and they were! A special was the Branzino over a vegetable Rosotta - delicious! I just wish they had provided a larger portion!  You don't have to overspend on as Vegas or limit yourself to the strip - find this place just out of town within 15 minutes - worth the effort!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this place and it was great. Very attentive, anticipating our needs and we will be back.  Our server was Steve was great, ask for him."}
{"text":"4-17-2017  I went to Gaetano's on a Monday around 5:15pm. I was greeted immediately by a man impeccably dressed and very friendly and seated in an area that I requested.  There was a couple seated near me at the bar watching and discussing the hockey game on TV and I was impressed with the knowledge of the bartender and the patrons about hockey and enjoyed listening to their discussion.  I was immediately tended to with a menu and  my drink order was given.  The servers tended to my every need and seemed to appear as if they were reading my mind.  I was very impressed with the timing of the servers.  I had a Groupon that I paid $20 for $40 worth of food, which I thought was a great bargain.  I ordered the fried Zucchini as a appetizer and Lasagna with an order of Garlic Bread (as I found out that they did not serve Garlic Bread with Lasagna) but did serve a complimentary basket of toasted bread but it's not what I was hungry for.  I was brought a plate that had 5 small deep fried pieces that was not the Zucchini \"chips\" I was expecting but they were more like fried mozzarella and not wanting to question their version of fried zucchini, and wanting to sample what they brought, I ate the \"zucchini\".  It was nothing like what I was used to and I I was not impressed.  My Lasagna arrived just as I polished  off the appetizer.  It looked delicious.  It turned out to have one small layer of meat topped with pasta and cheese and it tasted more of pasta, with very little flavor until I  requested some red pepper flakes to give the dish  some dash.  I must admit that I have not eaten very much Italian food other that what is made at home in the Midwest, but I was not impressed with the food.  Like I said the servers were great, the atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was very clean and pleasant.  I just can't say with all honesty, that I found the food to be that good.  They seemed to have some very nice wine which the other customers seemed to enjoy.  My tab came to $44.00 ( $4 over the Groupon Coupon)  I tipped accordingly.  To be fair,  I hope you give them a try and that you have a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This place was great, if it was in any other town then Vegas it would get five stars. The food is authentic and most of our food seemed and tasted freshly cook. The menu is elegant and authentic but there is not a lot of things that would stand out or have an unusually special taste. When ordering our food I asked for a wine that was not too tannic or fruit forward and alexande our waiter recommended a Sicilian red wine that was exactly what I wanted. A lot of people complained about portion size however me and my girlfriend got a split plate and with the appetizer and bread that was more then enough. It is definitely not a buffet and elegant dining facilities usually focus on the quality of the meal rather then quantity. The crowd was also a bit older then most Vegas restaurants but it is off the strip and we went on a Friday night. I would definitely go to this restaurant again if I was off the strip and wanted authentic Italian food and great wine with knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Went back again on a week day. There were about 3 other parties besides mine there, so service was amazing! I tried their special for the day: seafood linguini. Holy MOLY!! It was SOOOO DELICIOUS! There were lobster, crab, clams, muscles, shrimp, calamari, scallops, oh my is right! The flavor was perfect: not too fishy despite having the whole Atlantic in my meal, the sauce wasn't too rich so I could keep eating without getting tired of it, and the meal itself was ginormous. I ate for about 30 minutes straight and didn't make a dent in it. My leftovers fed my boyfriend and I for 2 days!! MmmMMmm =P Plus, I was able to watch the basketball game that was playing in the bar section. What a perfect dinner!  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was amazing. The food was wonderful. I obviously couldn't wait to come back. I have never had a worst experience at a restaurant in my life. We had a 745 reservation didn't receive our food till 9. We ordered the ravioli and there was almost no filling(they were almost flat). They were only kinda warm. We asked the waiter if we could get different ones. Which he said of course no problem. Then all of a sudden the owner comes to table yells at us that is how they make the ravioli and no one has ever complained about them. We then decided to leave. Left $20 on the table for the waiter since it wasn't his fault. The owner then followed us outside, yelled at us again that no one has ever complained about his ravioli and don't ever come back. I am so upset over this whole thing. I have never been treated with such disrespect in my life."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it is phenomenal. I'm so in love with pasta, and I would way way way rather eat a $20 plate of homemade pasta from a locally owned business than eat a $15 plate of Olive Garden pasta with bottom of the barrel ingredients, crapola service, and a host of corporate BS.   The first time I went was spring Restaurant Week. I have to say that I wasn't overtly impressed with the meal for the price, but I did enjoy it enough to buy the Groupon and try it again. Last night I had the fig appetizer--goat cheese, balsamic, wrapped in proscuitto ($14 for 3, noooot worth it but still good) and the butternut squash ravioli. That dish is absolutely superb. The portion size is perfect. My mom had a marsala special which was also absolutely incredible....we cleaned our plates and then some. Dessert was the tiramisu, which I didn't really have room for and didn't need, but I still enjoyed the dessert like I do.   I would definitely come here again or recommend it to someone who wanted good, high-quality Italian food and didn't want to venture to the Strip for similar quality at twice the price."}
{"text":"There area a few times in life when you have delicious Italian food that brings back amazing memories of childhood growing up Italian. The Osso Bucco with saffron rissotto, the Veal Milanese, the eggplant rollatini ,stuffed zucchini blossoms with goat cheese all delicious! A must try! Great Italian food. Our server, Alex was excellent!"}
{"text":"I've  been coming here for years. The service is impeccable and the food is tasty. If your looking for a classy place to eat authentic Italian cuisine, highly recommended."}
{"text":"This could be my new favorite place to grab a drink and eat at the bar. There is something about eating at a bar that I really enjoy, and I loved the ambiance here. Had a groupon to use, my friend and I were dressed casual, when we arrived we felt slightly under dressed to sit in the dining area (I'm sure they wouldn't have mind but out of respect for the owners who were walking around) we decided to sit at the bar. It sat about 10-15 people, had two TV's, dark lighting with candle on the bar, a friendly bartender and a large wine list and specialty cocktail list. The bread basket was filled with soft, tasty bread and a side of oil AND vinegar (I appreciate it when balsamic is added to the olive oil). We ordered the prosciutto stuffed figs with arugula that went perfectly with my Sauvignon Blanc, it was delicious. The menu was extensive, filled with the usual Italian favorites, one in particular, cioppino, which I will come back to try. When the bill came, our bartender informed us that an 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill PRIOR to the discount, which I don't think is a big deal like other people have complained about in other reviews, I'm sure it's to help prevent the cheap skates from not tipping properly. If you read your Groupon you would see prior to purchasing it, it states it plain and simple. Will definately return."}
{"text":"We are new in town an wanted to find a neighborhood Italian restaurant so that we did not have to travel to the strip every time.  Fell on Gaetano's.  I had the Mezzaluna pasta with pesto.  A server informed me that they did not have pesto.  Mrs. Gaetano came up and asked how everything was going.  I told her I was bummed because they did not have pesto.  Mr. Gaetano came over and said \"I make you pesto!\"  Best Italian meal I have EVER had at a restaurant.  Mind you, I am Sicilian and a good cook!  Great service as well!  Raymond and Chris took GREAT care of us!  Go to Gaetano's!"}
{"text":"Several people said we should try this place. It is ok, the owners are walking around and pleasant.  We found the pasta overcooked and similar to a chain restaurant.  It is pretty and seems to be well kept.  It is hard to put my finger on why this place was just ok.  Maybe it is that no one working there seemed to have much personality."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times over the years.  It is an exceptional restaurant.  It is family run and operated.  The owner (Gaetano) and his son (Nick) are very good at what they do, and they do a great job of making you feel special.  This restaurant is a little old school, and they do not try to follow fads or be hip.  It is just a clean, comfortable place, with great food.  They also have numerous specials nightly.  If you want good Italian food, you should try this place."}
{"text":"Gaetano's has become my go-to Italian spot in Henderson. I really value the consistent quality, variety (especially with all their nightly specials), friendly service, and intimate atmosphere of this restaurant. It's places like these that make working out all week worth it just so I can stuff my face here every so often.  I know the list of nightly specials can be a bit daunting as it's a long list recited by the waiter, but I strongly recommend giving it a try - it truly has their best dishes. Among the many great specials, my faves are the mushroom soup, filet tip papardelle, cioppino, stuffed veal chop, duck breast, and pork bracioli. I do love the butternut squash ravioli off the regular menu - their preparation here is one of the better ones I've had anywhere - and sometimes I'll go with the classic veal parm. But usually with all the rotating goodies on the specials list, there's just something too good there to pass up.  Don't forget to save room for dessert. The special espresso which comes with a touch of liquor is a great way to finish off the meal, too."}
{"text":"You would think this place belongs nestled in an upscale casino on the strip for its quality and yet at the same time, you wouldn't be surprised if it was a neighborhood place in Rome or Sicily! This place is spectacular! Food is always fresh, delicious, and made with love. What a gem to have in Henderson. Gaetanos is in a league of it own and to even think of mentioning it in the same breath with other neighborhood \"Italian\" places like Montesano's or Buon Gusto would be a travesty!"}
{"text":"The food was average and the dinning room was really loud. Service started out good but ended terrible. It took 15 mins from the time they took our dinner plates to receiving the dessert menu.  It looks like they have 3 waiters and 4 servers/bus boys. The communication between both is where I think we fell through the crack.  I used a groupon and they automatic add a tip. I would have left only 3% if I had a choice.  Tips = To Insure Proper Service"}
{"text":"I was taken here by a good friend who knows the owner from Calabassas, CA. This is a must. The best Italian restaurant I have ever been to. The service was first class. I will definitely be back. Trust me, this place is worth it"}
{"text":"We had a $40 Groupon for the restaurant and went last Saturday evening.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and we were right on time.  The place was almost empty at the time and we were shown to our table.  There is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can't double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.  We were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember in Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It's just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.  We ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.  For dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla crème brulée.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn't taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The crème brulée was the winner of the two desserts.  I think Gaetano's is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the Groupon.  I'm not a fan of that.  Actually, the server lost because he got a lesser tip than he would have gotten had I made the decision and not the restaurant.  A good meal but a bit of a drive from Summerlin.  I can get equal or better Italian closer and for a better price."}
{"text":"Our dining experience was excellent. The food was delicious. We had homemade Fettuccini and Chicken Marsala. Our server, Angel is one of the best servers in the Valley! He made the five star dinner even better! Thank you, Angel."}
{"text":"A great place to impress your date.  Listen for the specials before deciding, but ask the prices if your budget is tight. An appetizer can cost more than an entree.  Amazing tast.   They have never disappointed us. Fork tender short ribs. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for. A complete menu with a very knowledgeable wait staff. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week (2013)  I forgot my phone when I came here.  :(((((     While waiting to be seated, Nick the bartender made me an awesome Manhattan.  I'm not sure if Lisa being with us had anything to do with that but it was better than what I had the night before.  Was it made with rye whiskey perhaps??  The owner welcomed us when we sat, I love it when they do that!  But our first course the arugula was missing so he substitute it with another greens but the nut, fruit, and dressing was still delish.  I left my phone at home.  :(  I was trying to listen for it on my way there with the chance I might have dropped it but no.  The next course I thought was a red velvet ravioli it was so good.  But the stuffing inside the ravioli were beets!  The brown butter sage sauce was perfect for this pasta dish.    Because I lost my phone I wasn't entirely lost, 215 and Eastern is my favorite intersection in Las Vegas (technically Henderson) so I had an idea where it was without having Google Maps by my side.  My main entree was the veal sorrenta.  You had two other choices of a sole fillet (Christina gave me her remaining fish and it was so good!) and a chicken breast dish.  My veal sorrenta came with a layer of grilled eggplant, melted bufala mozzarella, veggies, and potatoes.  This was a solid restaurant week choice, $50 with $5 going towards charity.   Thank you Gaetano's for participating in restaurant week!    Even if I'm 30 mins late next time I'm never leaving my phone behind!"}
{"text":"Gaetano's is EXCEPTIONAL. I haven't been to a really stellar Italian Restaurant since I lived in Chicago, but this far-surpassed my expectations. It is truly a Vegas gem.  Their theory is, if they have it in the kitchen, they can make it for you. So if you are craving something specific and don't see it listed on the menu, it's worth asking if they can make it. Gaetano's always uses the highest quality and freshest ingredients. I ordered a plate of sausage and peppers with pasta and the serving size was excellent, the food was absolute delicious, and the wine pairing that Nick suggested was perfect.  Service-5 stars Food-5 stars Overall experience-5 stars  I recommend Gaetano's highly!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for her birthday . We have eaten here several times and the  dinning experience is outstanding. The food and service are always spectacular. The specials are amazing.  My wife had salmon with stuffed  crab and I had calamari steak. You must experience this restaurant"}
{"text":"Yelp is missing 2 stars. This is the real deal and the best Italian restaurant in the Las Vegas area. The menu is perfect and includes a great many dishes that are home cook specials rarely seen in restaurants. Each dish was perfectly cooked. The ingredients are very fresh. GO!"}
{"text":"Oh my what a pleasant surprise. I'm taking real Aubthentic gourmet Italian food.   To start the atmosphere is beautiful. Classy and elegant, a perfect place to take that special someone for a romantic evening.  Okay so the food. AMAZING!!    Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection, hot, beautiful presented, proportioned.    I also received amazing service from everyone there. The host Roary made our family feel very welcomed.    For dessert the home made tiramisu is a must!! I'm usually not a huge fan but my husband loves it so we ordered for my sons birthday. Came with a large slice, enough for 2.   We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Family owned and family run, this restaurant is authentic. This is my go-to Italian place in Henderson. I can eat-in or take-out and both are consistently good.   I enjoy their pastas and specials the most it's made fresh from quality ingredients. My favorite pasta is the Tomato Sauce Clams Vongole, it is with real clams in shell - not the canned or jarred kind."}
{"text":"The Chronicles of Groupons at Gaetano's, Episode Two: Attack of the Minimum Spending.  I returned to Gaetano's Ristorante with just days remaining to spend the promotional balance of my Groupon. The maitre d' greeted me and, in response to my request for a table for one, suggested that I go to the bar where I could enjoy some television. I shrugged and said sure, why not.  So I was seated in one corner of the bar with a bad angle for one television and hardly any lighting whatsoever for photos. Whoop-de-doo.  Anyway, the bartender/server got me some water and presented me with the dinner menu as well as a printout of Friday's specials. Tempting as the cioppino and the venison were, I stayed the course and went for the Ossobucco alla Milanese ($38.95), a braised veal shank with red wine demi-glace, fresh herbs, and tomato sauce, served with saffron risotto.  Complimentary bread was great again, although I puzzlingly enjoyed the tomato focaccia more than the ciabatta this time. Also, the olive oil seemed a bit less-than-generous.  The ossobucco arrived after I'd devoured the bread, and I resolved to ask for a brightly lit table next time. You eat with your eyes first, after all. Regardless, the food was great. The veal shank is a carnivore's delight, with delicious soft tendons connecting a bone to huge chunks of meal that decidedly do not taste like chicken (or other meats, for that matter). Dig inside the bone with the three-tined fork (or the knife) and you'll get bone marrow that I'm going to call meat butter. Get the veal, tendons, and meat butter evenly in your bites and enjoy. I will say that the saffron risotto was less creamy and a bit more al dente than I'd hoped, but it's a traditional complement to ossobucco and generally got along with the meats just fine.  When I presented my Groupon and asked for the check, I was informed that there is a $40 minimum subtotal required to redeem the Groupon. I was a bit dismayed, but I quickly ordered the tiramisu ($8.50) as it had drawn my eye earlier. The ample portion of tiramisu arrived soon afterward, and my first bite was met with joy that it wasn't anywhere near the disappointment that was the last tiramisu I'd tried. It's soft and sweet-but-not-too-sweet, and frankly everything you'd want out of a tiramisu save for the lack of alcohol. The cocoa powder stood out, perhaps because it was dusted over the plate and I was able to apply it liberally to every bite.  I'll probably try to get away from the risotto next time I eat at Gaetano's. Although my rating hasn't changed, I still felt the need to share my dining experience posthaste with those in search of Italian restaurants or carnivorous treats. Groupon or not, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"I've frequented Gaetano's for 25 years.  Unreal flavors!  The specials cannot be beat.  I rarely order off the menu due to the amazing daily special items.  Thankfully they have moved from Calabasas, CA to Vegas.  We were missing a really phenomenal italian restaurant.  A warm welcome to Mr. Gaetano.  I suggest not wearing jeans, but not crazy decked out either.  I'd say the per person cost is right around $20 - $40 ish, depending on whether or not you get wine.  A date for 2 is $100."}
{"text":"We ate our first meal there recently (four of us).  Everyone truly enjoyed the food.  If you're not too price sensitive, I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Even if you are price sensitive, I still recommend it, at least for special occasions.  Four pasta dishes, one salad, and a $30-something bottle of wine, tax and tip worked out to an average of ~$40 per person.  That's more than we normally want to spend on a meal, even a relatively good one, but the more I think about it the more I come to the conclusion that the quality of the whole experience was worth the price.  Even though we probably won't eat there often, I am sure we will eat there again.    Although our server didn't smile much his service was very professional, knowledgeable, efficient, and attentive.  The restaurant seemed to be on target with their reservations.  Everyone who came in seemed to be seated promptly although the restaurant remained pretty full.  The tables are well spaced and spacious.  Everything was clean.  Although it was busy, there were no significant distractions during our meal.  Although TVs showing sports could be seen in the bar, they are separated from the dining room by glass and therefore were not audibly disruptive to diners.  Gaetano's seems like it would be a good place to take a date.    I thought about details of Gaetano's compared with other Italian restaurants in the immediate neighborhood.  [Each of the other restaurants has negatives, including things like uncomfortable tables/chairs, sports on TV that can be seen and heard in the dining area, having to wait too long to be seated, tables being too close together, too much noise, etc., whereas Gaetano's had none of those problems.]  Gaetano's seems to have put a lot of effort into the whole experience, not just the food.  Note:  For many people this probably would have been a 5-star review.  I give 4 stars (would be 4-1/2 if given that option) only because of my personal preference not to spend quite so much money."}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away by this place. I'm usually not interested in most specials at restaurants, but *every* *single* special I heard when I was there sounded mouth watering. I had a pappardelle pasta with sliced filet mignon, porcini mushrooms in a mushroom Marsala wine sauce and I thought I died and went to heaven. The decor & atmosphere is simply stunning. Service is fine dining level. The owners son waited on us and he's really a great dude. They make all their own pastas, stocks, and sauces in house. The slightly higher prices are TOTALLY worth it. A must go!!!"}
{"text":"This place is first rate.    Best to stick with the specials, which is a full menu unto itself.  I tried the risotto as well as the salmon stuffed with crab.  In a nutshell:  excellent."}
{"text":"Great beautiful low lit romantic atmosphere!  Great staff.  The owner is still wandering around every night, Im not sure that is necessary, however the food is always excellent and the prices are great as well.  Happy hour at the bar is nice as well"}
{"text":"I had the mussels for an appetizer and I loved them! The vodka penne was good. Tiramisu was light and tasty. Service was good. More like a 3.5 Star"}
{"text":"Great local Gem!!! Had the chance to dine during Restaurant week was amazing. Great quality Italian dishes... try the pumpkin ravioli and the best selections of Italian cocktails.. we will be back!"}
{"text":"Gaetano's is an Italian family restaurant. This is family style eating at its finest. Anyone who comes in is treated like a guest who entered the living room and is welcome to come into the dining room. Hey guest! What are you doing in the kitchen! (Just kidding, but don't go into the kitchen).   The food is astoundingly good and puts other 'family style italian gardens' absolutely to shame. I don't care how many plates of food those places throw at you, you only need one plate of Gaetano's and you'll have some to take home. They'll do birthdays, parties or just dinner. No matter what, make a reservation. They won't let the place get crowded enough that you can't get service.   The bar is wonderful. My sister-in-law and I spent an entire night making up martinis with the bartender. It was so much fun. The bartenders are totally engaging and enjoy making new and interesting drinks.  Go and enjoy Gaetano's. Get the espresso to end the meal and have a drink after at the bar. Its a wonderful establishment and you feel good the minute you walk in the door."}
{"text":"Had eggplant rollatini which was stuffed with pasta. Tasted good but disappointed that it didnt have ricotta stuffing."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Gaetano's last night.  The restaurant was fairly easy to find, located right on Eastern Ave., though you may miss it if looking, as there's another business that's in front of it (obscuring it from the street).  I liked the decor, it was simple but elegant.    It took our waiter a few minutes to stop by to review the nightly specials, but not excessive.  Our waiter was friendly and had helpful recommendations when prompted.    My wife ordered the rigatoni with a sausage meat-sauce, I ordered the chicken piccata.  My wife's dish could have used a tad more sauce, and I would have thought my dish would have come with a side of pasta of some kind.  While both our dishes were very tasty, portion sizes were smaller than I expected; perhaps Italian portion sizes are just smaller here in Vegas compared to what I'm used to (we're from Boston, where portion sizes are often too large).  I don't think the prices are unreasonable, but it would have been nice to get a bit more with our meal (even just a small side of pasta).  This restaurant deserves a 3.5 out of 5, but since I can't give it a half-star, I'm going to round up because I like to support local business over chain restaurants."}
{"text":"We have had the pleasure on more than several occasions of dining here, it continues to maintain the quality of service and your taste buds continue to explode with every fork full that is placed in your mouth. I continue to be impressed every time we walk into this restaurant; Nick, your the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great atmosphere the man that owns it is really nice guy he comes to the table he sings he really respects his customers I've been coming to them for 5 years  never had any complaints keep up the great work.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Celebrated my 1 year anniversary with my boyfriend and had an amazing time. My boyfriend's plate was my favorite, he ordered the Lamb and Fettuccini Alfredo."}
{"text":"Amazing little gem hidden in a shopping strip. Food was amazing. Ambiance was wonderful and our waiter Alex was a terrific waiter. Would highly recommend this place. Will be coming back and asking for Alex."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't heard of Gaetano's until recently, but it definitely held up to what I heard and that's it being the best Italian spot in Vegas. Totally worth the drive and such a perfect spot for a dinner date. Penne alla Vodka was perfect."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came here for date night and had a great time. Delicious food, excellent service.  We had the Calamari Fritti as an appetizer and were very pleased with it. It was seasoned well and very crispy.   I ordered the Vitellina alla Parmigiana and it's probably one of the best things I've ever eaten.   Boyfriend ordered the duck breast and thought it was okay. He wasn't crazy about the sauce (red wine demi-glace) and he thought the duck was just slightly overcooked. He started eating off of my plate though and LOVED the veal.  Overall, I'd give this place 4.5 stars. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 4 stars.  Food Quality - 3.5 stars.  Food Quantity - 3 stars.  Service - 2 stars.  Price - 2 stars.  Policy - 0 stars.  We ordered the Vitellina alla Parmigiana (27.95) and the special of the day Ciappino (35.95)  The veal portion was small and there wasn't enough spaghetti to make up the difference.  It was good.  The ciappino was not like the ciappinos that I have had before.  This was more like a linguini with mixed seafood.  It was very good.  My husband and I went there using a Groupon, and we found out that an 18% tip is added on to all groupon (and other coupons).  That made our $20 worth only $8.  I am usually a good tipper, however the service didn't warrant 18%.  When we confronted the owner, she told us her waiters do not want to work for nothing.  Maybe she should hire better waiters.  We will not return because of this - and no, it is not the money - it is a $2 difference between the tip I would have left and what I had to leave."}
{"text":"I enjoy taking the family here for special occassions, love the upscale atmosphere and so far never had a bad dish. The specials are usually interesting but make sure you know the pricepoints on those as I once had a surprise. Especially love the veal dishes.........."}
{"text":"I'm always searching for quality Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas area and I'd rank this among my favorites so far.  My husband and I were doing the last minute where to eat game on a Saturday night. I knew I \"needed\" Italian food and this restaurant was my suggestion. I wish I remember how I found out about this restaurant in the first place, but I have no idea where my suggestion came from. Regardless, it was a great idea. I got nervous when we pulled into the parking lot and saw the number of people entering the restaurant. It was a last minute decision so we didn't have a reservation. No problem! The hostess sat us right away and didn't act annoyed that we had arrived without a reservation.  The inside of the restaurant is much larger than it appears from the outside. It's decorated the same as most other traditional Italian restaurants are decorated. The room is nice and open with tables nicely spaced. The restaurant also has a fairly large bar area separated by a wall.   We started with the free Bruschetta with the Yelp check in offer. I enjoyed the toasted bread with the fresh bruschetta ingredients. It wasn't overloaded with garlic. The bread basket was nice with some herbed bread, plain ciabatta, and lavash. The herbed bread was my favorite bread. Bread is served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. That part I didn't love because the balsamic wasn't quality and was overpowering the oil. Oil with seasoning would have been much better. In fairness, I'm a balsamic snob so this probably isn't something that other people would even care about or notice.  The menu offered so many great entrée options. It was hard to choose. My husband and I finally narrowed to two items and switched plates at the half-way point. The Lasagna Bolognese had a nicely flavored Bolognese with plenty of meat and cheese. This was both tasty and hearty. The Chicken Parmesan was nicely breaded and I liked the flavor of their marina sauce.   Even though we'd probably eaten too much at this point I just couldn't resist dessert. The Pistachio Tartufo was excellent. The pistachio ice cream was creamy and had the pistachio punch I was craving. The chocolate chips and cherry were nice with the pistachio flavor.   Our server was nice and delivered each course with good timing. We maintained full water glasses and were checked in on often. We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"only bad part is you might gain weight from frequent returns. used to go 2 or 3 times per week when i lived in Henderson. now that im back in LA, when i do visit Vegas 78% of the reasoning is to once again get some real Sicilian food made by this amazing family! Miss you guys!!"}
{"text":"There is a good reason why Zagat choose this place as best restaurant in Vegas, as well as earning best of Vegas awards from various establishments.  Gaetano is a full blooded Sicilian who take personal pride and works at the his restaurant of 9 years.  Nice guy with a thick Italian accent who sell any item on the menu to you.   It beats over hyped Iron Chef Batali 2 restaurants in the Venetian hands down, and in addition been to Italy several times and know the real deal ... Not to mention some of my favorites in NYC, SF, and LA.  Kids and I had their hand made pappardelle pasta with Fillet Mignon tips. Both just melts in your mouth.. so tender, first time I thought gumming food  was pleasurable.  Lobster Zuppe De Pesce (omg) over Linguini... the BEST ever. I've had many others and nothing like this!  Clearly it doesn't get any more authentic or better than Gaetano's. This is going to be my favorite Italian when I am in town."}
{"text":"Great little place (way) off the strip, I love italian food, and this place wasn't too bad. I came here with my girlfriend and split a carpaccio dish, veal with shiitake mushrooms, and a gnocchi dish with her. I don't eat veal a lot, but I was a little surprised at how it came out; the sauce and mushrooms were great, along with the steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes it came with, but for some reason the veal just wasn't what I was picturing in my head. Don't let that deter you though, that might just be how veal is, and I didn't know it.   The gnocchi was excellent, very flavorful with the gorgonzola sauce, and it was hard to stop eating even though I was already stuffed.   The waitstaff were excellent as well! Our personal waiter wasn't that friendly and seemed a little scatterbrained, but all the other people on the floor more than made up for it. I'm pretty sure some of the people that stopped to talk to us were either the owner or the manager. and the hostess was most helpful in calling a cab for us and then letting us know when it arrived."}
{"text":"This was such a great place. Made reservations for 615p, although they weren't needed.  Everything from arriving at the restaurant, the service, food, it was all great. Had bought a Groupon and using it was hassle free. Ordered the asparagus soup which was a special for the evening and the gnocchi with bolognese sauce. 5 stars across the board. Will definitely be back for more. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation and upon arrival, were seated almost immediately.  Service throughout the meal was prompt, although not particularly personal (for instance, we kept getting the same canned line from our waiter in response to everything).  The place was clean.  Many people in the reviews have commented on the space (ambiance), it was nice, nothing to write home about.  We met the owner, he came over to our table to give us our menus and later, our wine, but he didn't really talk with us.   Our food was above-average, but not the best Italian (certainly not the worst) we've ever had.  Specifically, we had two salads, two entrees, a glass of red wine, two glasses of dessert wine, and one dessert.  The entrees were pretty good, not too filling.  We were shocked at the prices of the alcohol, the mark-up is astronomical.  Overall, for what I listed, our bill was $136, not including tip.    We felt the bill was ridiculously expensive for the amount of food we received. Another reviewer mentioned, and I concur, that the pasta is perfectly arranged to cover the plates but in actuality, is not that much food. Certainly not worth the price!  If we return, it will be for their bar menu, which is offered Monday through Thursday from 5-7 p.m., and we won't be drinking any alcohol.  If you go, not during happy hour, plan on salads ranging from $10-15 and entrees ranging from $19-30.  You will find pasta dishes, with no protein, listed for mid $20's, which is, in my opinion, too expensive."}
{"text":"Looking for a local off-strip Italian restaurant and found this one on Groupon. We bought the $40 voucher and had no issues using it. The restaurant is really nice, the atmosphere very relaxed just what we needed for a Monday night. The service was excellent and the food amazing!! We got a bottle of wine, I tried the Penie alla Vodka with chicken and my husband the Chicken Fettucine Alfredo, both were incredible! Cooked to perfection and the perfect amount of sauce!! Oh forgot about the complementary bread! Way too good! :)"}
{"text":"food is AMAZING service is WONDERFUL such a lovely restaurant! We had a great time :)"}
{"text":"The food is very good, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, the staff are attentive, the owner is friendly and always visits the diners tables. We have really enjoyed our dining experiences here. The only criticism I have is that the prices are a bit high, even by Vegas standards.  $18 for gnocchi? The gnocchi are pretty good but I've had way better and for more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Ok so the best thing I can say about this place is that it is never crowded....and this probably has something to do with the fact that Mrs Gaetano basically yells at the patrons. We have been here twice and BOTH times she greeted us and was abrasive and rude. The food is pretty good but way overpriced for the quality.  It's close to where we live in the Anthem area but we will drive further to get good food and acceptable service."}
{"text":"Love it here. The family who runs it are really nice and hospitable. The service is usually very good. Best of all, the food is great quality. The gnocchi is amazing! They also have a butternut squash ravioli that is great. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a date. Awesome restaurant. The pricing for the portions and quality is not bad at all. Steve is the best server you can ask for. The experience was amazing and I will personally revisit often."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and have yet to have anything that was less than excellent.  Tonight I had the eggplant appetizer that is always top notch.  The venison special was cooked perfect with an excellent risotto side.  I won't give past reviews on past meals other than to say everything I have had made me come back for more.  It inspired my first of many yelp reviews.  Definitely eat here if in Henderson or las vegas."}
{"text":"My fault for not making reservations and requesting my friend Nick to be our waiter.  However, nothing is like a night out on the town dressed up with Blair B., her husband Mike B., and Eric R.!  We each brought restaurant.com coupons, and ended up using the $50 off $100 (what a deal!)  The coupon includes alcohol.  Mike B. proudly picked the wine with his wine app, so I said we would go with it.  It was okay, but since Blair already said it wasn't her favorite, I will go ahead and agree (I am not much for red wine but did it for my heart, baby!)  We started off with complementary bruschetta, bread and olive oil/basalmic, and the wine.  Gaetano himself gave us the specials, and there were like 42 of them.  Our waiter finally reviewed them with us (though a few were sold out) and we were more confused (the menu is already big as it is).  I ended up getting the butternut squash ravioli with sage and brown butter, and magnificent it was!  The beef carpaccio appetizer was also delicious and at least I can say our waters were refilled rapidly.  Eric R. ordered a veal dish as his main and a half order of the special risotto of the day, bay scallop and shiitake.  It was outstanding and I couldn't stop eating it.  To top it off, my friend Nick sent over via our waiter complementary \"house cappucinos\" which were essentially hot bittersweet chocolate with 3ish liqueurs and topped with whipped cream.  Eric R. was skeptical because he hates coffee and when he tried it, he was relieved.  YUM!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem!!! The food is authentic Italian!!  Everything is homemade!!! Momma checks you in and daddy comes by to make sure all is well!  Each dish was plate licking good!!! The bread basket alone was amazing all hot and fresh with a variety of flavors!!!  Loved our waiter, Alex was  attentive and knowledgeable !  He should train some of these Vegas waiters!!!  They were also very accommodating to a couple of our preferences!!! Even the deserts fresh and all made from scratch that day!!!  Delicioso!!  See you again real soon!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars only because I can't give more! A piece of Italy in Henderson. Fresh homemade pasta lot of specials, really well prepared servers. Alexande was great his suggestions were perfect the mezzelune ripiene di vitello con porcini were amazing!"}
{"text":"I have to say I bought a groupon so wasn't sure what to expect but wow was I impressed! We asked our waiter his favorites based on a few of our choices and he said the homemade pasta. So glad we listened! The food was amazing! The service was exceptional, Steve did a great job with his suggestions and making sure we were enjoying our dinner. Such a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"I dont care if your Italian, American, Mexican, etc  or rich, poor or middle class  if you own a restaurant you should be humble and gracious!  We went in around 9:30 NYE after working all day.  I'm assuming the large older man with a thick Italian accent at the front desk was MR Gaetano?  He wasnt any of the things I would expect from an owner.  That was the start of our experience.  The menu was set since it was NYE as many places do, so that wasnt an isssue.  We waited quite awhile to even be greeted by our server and by this time it was close to 10 so they weren't THAT busy.  We ordered wine, 2 meals, and Calamari for an App and cheescake for dessert.  Not one thing was impressive.  I was expecting to be wowed.  The bill was $139 before tip.  I hate to sound so negative but thats the experience I had.  Sad too because we like to eat at non chain restaurants.  Hopefully it was just a long day since it was New Years Eve and everyone was tired and ready to go home."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. The food amazing, very nice wine selection, owners were gracious and my service was outstanding.  The atmosphere was wonderful.  I also like the separate bar area where I may stop by for a glass of wine. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Although I have taken kids there and they were so accommodating I prefer to go with just the hubby and I. Everything we've tried is delicious. I love the vodka penne, bruschetta, and definitely get some extra red sauce to dip the bread in. We no longer live in the area but every time we visit we have to go to gaetanos!!!!"}
{"text":"05/08 Nick, the owners' son was again our waiter, but the parents were not on the premises.  We shared the evening's special salad - arugula and fennel in a blood orange and lemon dressing.  Ms. Westie's entrée was mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini - homemade half moon pasta filled with veal and served with peas, prosciutto and porcini mushrooms in a light cream sauce.  I chose the evening's special pasta - homemade wild mushroom ravioli in a mascarpone cream sauce.  All three dishes were outstanding."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Henderson! Great Italian food with upscale casual atmosphere. The owner is truly passionate about food and attention to service. He stopped by to check on our table to see how we were doing and was genuinely engaging. The wait staff is extremely attentive  and very helpful. Our waiter Nick named all the specials of the day and was very professional. I always try to order something different when I come here and I am always pleased with whatever I try. Quality is a high priority here and you can taste the it! The chicken Alfredo may sound simple, but oh boy it something special here! The pasta is tender and fresh. The sauce is buttery and cheesy. Yum! I tried the eggplant rotoline (spelling) and it was tasty too. It was grilled eggplant stuffed with Angel hair pasta with red sauce and melted cheese on top. The calamari is tender and so far the best I've tried in town. This is a great place for dates and special nights out. The place is classy, but not pretentious. You don't have to wear a suite, but dressy casual would be a good way to describe the attire. There is also a bar on the right hand side separated by a wall from the dining room, so that's nice of you want to watch a sports game and have dinner with a drink. You can also end dinner with a delicious desert and a cappuccino.  I really like going here and I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"The Italian food here is good not great though. For the price you can defininetely find better in Las Vegas. I have been here quite a bit because its close, so I have given this place ample chances to try to impress me."}
{"text":"the beef short ribs are to die for, so tender and moist, everything I have eaten there is yummy.  Pizza in the bar on Mondays and always have specials every week, its a long drive, but I promise is worth it."}
{"text":"I scheduled a birthday dinner here last minute due to unmet needs at another restaurant. Never been there until that night, but I heard from my supervisor that the food is really good. I can celled my other reservation and called them to see if they could take my group on such a short notice. When I called, I spoke to the manager who was completely understanding and helped me set up the reservation. I ended up being really satisfied! 1. They accommodated me and my guests and 2. They were genuinely nice to my friends and me. I really enjoyed my dinner here. I brought a cake with me and they lit the candles and brought it out to me. As well as cut the cake and served it. They really do care about their customers here. It's more like family here. The food was really good too. I had penne pasta which was really tasty and cooked just right. I still hear from my guests that they enjoyed the food and service here and this was a year ago! At the time, they were able to split checks. Which is one of the reasons why I dumped the other place. They tried to pull a quick one on me and tell me they couldn't do it the day of my dinner, even though previously they said they would. I am SO glad I chose to go to Gaetano's! I would definitely recommend this place. It's not cheap, but it's really good and the workers are super nice!"}
{"text":"My favorite food is Italian food.  This is a problem as I have invested a great deal of time in trying different Italian restaurants, and after a few years, have not successfully found ones with decent quality.    Just for you to understand my quality level, Maggiano's, an Italian restaurant chain is the bare minimum standard for Italian food.  If I am desperate and want Italian food, I will reluctantly go there..  Macaroni Grill is crap, Olive garden is a joke.  Please don't get me started on CPK.   Additionally, I only rate food.  I don't care about the environment, if it's hot or cold, if I'm getting hot flashes or not.  I will eat quality food in a blizzard, so long as the arctic winds do not compromise the taste of the food.    The food is good.  Al dente pasta, tasty.  Very well done.  Service was excellent as well - not that I care about service, but merely pointing it out as a noticeable fact, as 7 different waiters and 4 busboys asked me if there was anything I required.  There have been 2 other restaurants that I have discovered that is just as good.  And both of them are in California.  I have eaten at B&B and it PALES in comparison to Gaetano's.  Sorry Mario Batale, maybe your sou chef was off that night, but I was not pleased with the quality of food.  I recommend you come here.  The fact that this restaurant is not 5 stars by others makes me wonder - do people not have taste buds?"}
{"text":"We went for our first time to this beautiful restaurant. It is tucked in the corner of this shopping area but once you walk through the doors you may forget where you are...for a little while. The service is excellent, our waiter Nick was superb! We started with an appetizer of grilled portobello.... enough for two to share. My husband had eggplant and I had veal ravioli. My dish was excellent, fresh and well flavored.  And even though I was totally full ....I had to have the cannoli, which was very impressive. The shell was light and crisp with a light ricotta cream. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Always great service. Food very good. European portions. Pricey bit well worth it."}
{"text":"The server was excellent . We got there at 5 and it was quiet and empty. They sat us in the back by the kitchen,because I didn't have a reservation I assume. Waiter customized my meal which was lemon picatta and that was nice. More lemon zest needed but I was happy. On entering a couple were trying to get seated but he only had a tank top so was refused service.  Hostess/owner was coughing, blowing nose and seen eating at the bar and making wise jokes of ex patrons. They sat two women at the front of the restaurant and let their conversations be yelled during the entire meal.     Glad it was a groupon because I was disturbed by their behaviour.  In my opinion tank top man should be allowed in because you should feel grateful to have any customers."}
{"text":"This place is so cute but we were one of the first people to sit down and one of the last to leave. I know eating out takes time but three hours is far too long. There were only 4 of us in our party. Our waiter was nice but had no urgency whatsoever. He didn't seem to care at all. He just kept looking at the football game and we kept seeing him on his phone. It was very unprofessional for such nice restaurant."}
{"text":"$25.00 bucks for spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were 100% FAIL. My 7 year old could have balled up some meat and left it on the dashboard to cook and it would have had the same flavor. This place is not authentic and it is simply over priced. If they had actually made some kind of impression with the food I would have not bothered with writing this. However, this was the worst ever.......eeeeeever. I dare not allow a real Italian in there to taste this can and box food. Sorry but the truth is the truth. Zero craftsmanship or artisan pride."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I'm sure this is a fine establishment for regulars.  I finally stopped in here to try them out tonight.  To be clear, I love trying new places, I love eating great food, and I love giving fair reviews. What I don't appreciate however, is poor customer service. One of my biggest pet peeves is staff that blatantly ignore you. Now, this may have been the owner or a member of the family, but to stand in front of someone for 5 minutes while they talk on the phone and refuse to acknowledge you while you're trying to patronize the business is a deal-breaker for me. Most relationships business or otherwise  heavily depend on a person's first experience.  In the restaurant business this is typically  with the first person you encounter and regretfully this was my experience. Especially with so many good and great Italian restaurants in the area. Trattoria Italia is four blocks down Eastern and one of my favorites. I will continue to try new restaurants and patronize my regulars, sadly this establishment will not be on that list."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but good things about this restaurant. So when my GF saw a Groupon for it, we decided to try it out.   First impressions. The woman who greeted us at the door was the owner's wife. We arrived 30 minutes early. She sat us but overall, I wouldn't describe her as warm or welcoming.  Maybe she was having a bad night, who knows. But leave your negativity at the back door.    It's a very nice looking restaurant. Warm colors, romantic lighting, but there is somewhat of a sterile feeling.  The server Zack was great. He was very accommodating to my GF's dietary restrictions and was very friendly. All of the other service staff including the owner' son were also friendly and service was very smooth.   The food: the bread that comes out I delicious, dangerously delicious. There is a pizza type of bread that has marinara and cheese. The texture was light as air. The other bread was equally as good.   There is a Yelp check in offer for a complementary Bruschetta. The flavors were great but the tomato mixture was ice cold.  I ordered the Brodetto. The flavors were also very good but Brodetto means broth and the sauce was more of a marinara sauce thickness not a broth by any means.  I had the Ossobuco Milanese. It was very delicious. The saffron risotto was perfectly cooked and a perfect compliment for the Ossobuco.  They have gluten free pasta, which is great for people who eat gluten free like my significant other. They served it with a mushroom cream sauce which she enjoyed.  During our dining experience, we noticed the owner Gaetano walking around talking to all of the regulars. When he did stop by our table, it seemed like it was almost forced. He barely looked us in the eyes. Not exactly the warm welcome we expected for patronizing his restaurant.   In the end, we asked for our check, when the owner's wife presented the check she told us gratuity was included. Not only that, but the gratuity was added on the after tax total, not the before tax subtotal. This is just tacky. Not something you should do to locals trying out your restaurant for the first time. Yes it says they add gratuity on the Groupon but, Groupon  also says to make sure you tip off the non-discounted total.  Since Zack and the staff were so great, I added more to make it an even 20%, which is what he deserved. I think a party of 2 shouldn't have their gratuity added. This left a very bitter feeling towards this restaurant. Just writing about their auto gratuity policy is getting me mad.   It seems this restaurant has all the right makings of something great. Its nice looking, has good food, friendly staff.  But the owner's attitudes and policies ultimately leave the final impression of this place something to be desired.  As a local restaurant, you should try to make sure your customers come back and feel welcomed.  WE won't be back and won't recommend this place to anyone   P.S. Please look at the 29 reviews not recommended at the bottom of their page. They are an eye opening look into how the owners treat their patrons. I don't know why Yelp doesn't recommend them but please read them!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, all from getting their groupon.  The food always tastes good, most of the time I get the calamari and the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini, a veal stuffed pasta in a cream sauce with mushrooms, peas, and prosciutto.   The only times where I was disappointed with the food was when I got the caesar salad and another time I got a cannoli. The dressing for the caesar was very underwhelming, with most of the salad consisting of the more stalky parts of romaine. The cannoli cream in the cannoli wasn't smooth and creamy, I guess they used ricotta so it was chunky and pasty/gritty.  The service is always top notch. I am always offered more bread, red sauce if I don't want the oil and vinegar that normally comes with it, I am always seated and served promptly, and my drink always remained full. The waiters are always knowledgeable about the menu and are always friendly.  My only main complaint with the place is the portion size of the dishes in combination with the price. It isn't so bad since I am paying half price with the groupon, but I would most likely feel ripped off if I was paying full price. The calamari is 13 bucks and barely  fills half the plate, especially since the other half is used for the saucer of marinara that comes with it. The veal stuffed pasta comes to 19 bucks, and it was never filling. While it always tastes awesome, the pasta never has that much filling in it, and there is never more than 10 of them on the plate, perfectly spaced out to cover the plate. If you are paying almost 20 dollars for a pasta dish, you should leave feeling full and satisfied, not continually asking for more bread and carbonated soda to not leave hungry.  The food is good, at least the things I consistently get like the pasta and calamari. I just wish there was more on the plate for the price they are asking. As long as they offer a groupon here, I will keep coming. I would never pay full price for this place."}
{"text":"My son and I were here to celebrate his 19th birthday. Each year we go to a different Italian restaurant in town . . .  I don't even know where to start....  When we entered the restaurant we were greeted by an older lady who was the hostess. She gave us the once over and a disapproving look and the way she spoke, was \"snooty\". We were seated at a little two top table in the corner of the restaurant even though there were plenty of larger tables as the restaurant was not busy.  The server assistant brought us each water. After maybe 5 minutes the waiter came by and rattled off the specialty items. He also had quite the \"attitude\". We were ready to order about 5 minutes later, but just sat there. After about 20 minutes another waiter came and took our order. The server assistant refilled our drinks, brought us the bread, brought us the food, cleared our dishes, brought us our dessert, The waiter reappeared after we were done eating to ask us how everything was. The hostess \"almost\" redeemed herself by giving us a faint smile when she brought me the check.  I have never been treated so shitty by any staff at any restaurant. I'm in my mid-50's and have been to hundreds of restaurants. Even my son was irritated and thought they were extremely rude. He is majoring in Culinary in school himself.  The food itself was pretty good. My son had the chicken parmigiana and he liked it. I had the Chicken Ravioli with Pesto Cream Sauce. The ravioli was good but I was NOT a fan of the sauce. It was way too thick, not what I would call a cream sauce at all.  The highlight of the whole meal were the desserts. My son had the Tiramisu and I had the cannoli. They were both VERY good.  By the time the meal was over, I had really wished I had cash on me because believe me, I would have tipped the server assistant and stiffed the douche bag waiter. Unfortunately, though, I didn't. I debated not leaving a tip at all but then decided to leave a 25% tip in hopes that maybe it would \"maybe\" make the waiter feel like a bit of an jerk. With his personality though, it was probably a moot point.  Funniest part was, that I probably make more money than any of those people dining in there do.  I have NEVER been treated so poorly by someone in my life.  We will NEVER go back and I feel bad because we were there to celebrate my son's birthday and it was such a miserable experience."}
{"text":"I went here for my 3 year anniversary and we had exceptional service and wonderful food. The waiter took what seemed like 20 pictures for us and then gave us a free piece of cake to make us feel special. Best service I have had in years of being in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Dinner for three at 6:30P on a Saturday. My companions had spaghetti with meatballs (not on menu, but cheerfully prepared), and chicken Marsala.  I had rigatoni with Bolognese sauce.  My companions reported that their entrees were excellent.  My rigatoni was among the best I've had. All were expertly prepared and served graciously by Adriene our server. Beverage service was prompt as was the appetizer and main course.  Notably, there were ten daily specials offered that were \"off the menu\". The owner gave personal attention to ensure we had been told about the specials. Nice Sicilian restaurant."}
{"text":"I finally made my way back to this place again few months ago because I wanted to have their gnocchi and bread again. It was a huge disappointment. The bread was nothing like the first time I had which was soft and fluffy, instead this time was cold and nothing out of ordinary. Even more disappointing, the gnocchi was overcooked and too soft compared to before and the flavor was just okay. When manager came by and got the check , she asked us about our dinner. I told her honestly that I didn't like it as much as I did before. She just told me it's the same chef all along. Oh well, will not be returning."}
{"text":"My friend/ex-roomie and I love this spot for our QT dates. We've always had a great experience but this last one was the best by far. We had a restaurant.com certificate, so our bill for a bottle of wine, an appetizer and two entrees came to $40 each (including tip). That's a great deal for amazing food and fine dining service.   We got the eggplant app this time, and it was so good. It's like a cheesy crunchy layered veggie lasagna with light tomato sauce. We devoured it. I couldn't decide between the mezzalune or the special italian sausage and shitake mushroom ravioli so the server offered to have the kitchen make me a half order of each. I was amazed by this generous offer!  And when I got my food, I was so happy as each dish was so delicious. I ate my entire plate.  My roomie got the fettucini alfredo and she too finished her entire plate.    This is just one of my fave restaurants when I want to splurge on calories. If you have a Groupon or restaurant.com, it's a steal for the quality of food and service you get."}
{"text":"Gaetano Palmeri is a bona fide professional.  Having dined at his place in Calabasas, CA years ago, he's not skipped a beat.  The menu will satisfy just about anyone seeking an Italian meal with a great range of starters, a variety of pastas, great seafood and meat selections.  We're fond of the warm cabbage salad, but tonight we opted for the special arugula with goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette split.  My wife devoured the barramudi with chopped tomato and I coasted along with a risotto with chicken and asparagus.  Perfect mid-week meal.  The dining room is so comfortable in a refined way.  Murals and mirrors on the walls with soft but adequate lighting goes beyond inviting.  A full bar can start or end the meal and I'm told the desserts are special.  Can't say enough good things about Gaetano's.  We're not missing a repeat visit any time soon."}
{"text":"I came here a Friday for dinner and the place was pretty full! I was surprised because I had gone for an early dinner (5:00pm). Anyway, we were seated promptly and received excellent service from our waiter.   As an appetizer I ordered the fried zucchini flowers which are filled with goat cheese. This had good flavor but to me it seemed like it was frozen. When I bit into it some parts of the cheese were colder than others...which can only happen if the product was frozen prior. The flavor per se was ok but not a dish I would order again. A bit disappointing since I love goat cheese.   The second thing I ordered was the salmon stuffed with crab. This is an off the menu item but it is a special that our very attentive waiter recommended. This dish was served and I wish I was told it was going to be hot...because I burned my tongue. Anyway, the dish was also very flavorful but the salmon seemed a bit dry. I think this dish is missing some sort of sauce reduction to go on the top of the salmon.   The third dish ordered by my hubby was the risotto with shrimp. He devoured his plate and loved the flavors. I had a taste of his and it seemed like a delicious plate.   Overall I loved the service received here. The place is pricy so just be aware you will spend over $90 on two people if your order an appetizer. We did not get drinks. FYI: this restaurant has plenty of offers you can look for. On the website restaurant.com they had a $25 dollars off coupon over $50. Purchasing this coupon is $10 so you end up with a $15 savings. I have also heard they have Groupons available."}
{"text":"When you first walk into the restaurant, you're not even welcomed. You're stared at and then the guy asks if he can help you. We were there for a birthday dinner and we were still waiting for a few guests to show up. We asked to have some bread and the waiter rudely says that we need to order dinner before we get any bread. I've never heard of that before! Why would we be there for a birthday reservation and not order dinner?! So then the waiter says that he'll be back when the rest of our party shows up. When the last person got there he came and rambled off the specials very fast and we barely saw him the rest of the night. The other reviews are true when they say the owners seem to stand in the corner and stare at you.   The food was ok, nothing special. It took FOREVER to come. Then we waited forever to get our check. The waiter never offered us drinks. We were only served water. Maybe if we had gotten some bread early on we would have ordered wine to go with it.   Maybe this place should treat all their new guests as well as they seemed to cater to their regulars. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Nothing special. My braised meat was dry and my husbands pasta was bland."}
{"text":"This was a great find. My husband and I had dinner here a few days ago. Great experience. The waiter (sorry I can't remember his name) even customized a plate for my husband who could t decide between entrees. The wine was amazing, food was amazing and staff very attentive. I highly recommend having a meal here soon."}
{"text":"This little gem in Henderson made me (yes, me!) like mushroom ravioli!  Our waiter was amazing and sold me on the homemade ravioli with sausage, mushroom and asparagus and I loved it!  We started off with the wonderful stuffed dates appetizer and arugula salad.  I had a bite of my friend's pasta with vodka sauce which was also amazing!  We ended the night with their tiramisu, and I wish I had saved room.  What a wonderful place- great service and amazing food!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"The BEST Italian restaurant in Las Vegas! Italian is my favorite food; however, I hadn't come across a decent restaurant until a friend all the way from Pennsylvania recommended Gaetanos! The service was impeccable and the food my goodness was out of this world!!! I will definitely go back and recommend to all of my family and friends!!"}
{"text":"Delicious beyond words. The fetticine  and braised short ribs melted in my mouth. The owners and family that work here came by the table to say hello. Good old fashioned courtesy that goes far in this impersonal world. I just love the Italians. They turned a mostly vegetarian into a carnivore tonight.   Yummmmmy!!"}
{"text":"We didn't have a reservation and they were more than happy to take us in. Hosts were nice and refilled my water without having me to ask even once.  I did not notice any girl hostesses or servers that night? Maybe they were off or something.  Food: Servers were very friendly in recommending something to eat from the menu. We had portabella mushroom as an appetizer and I had fish to eat for dinner. it was really good.  Prices were on the upside. This place is great for date night and small social gatherings. I would come back here."}
{"text":"Checked this out with a chef friend of mine.  Nothing to really complain about at this place but nothing that blew me away.  I had the short rib dish - the short ribs were cooked well though it was kind of messing the melt in your mouth texture I like.  Might have been the short ribs themselves rather than the way it's cooked.  Came with a blah gnocci I didn't really like or hate.  Just blah. My chef buddy had some pork special.  It was ok - but again nothing special.  Pork breaded and wrapped with something.  Just wasn't great.  Also ordered a side of spaghetti and marinara.  Nothing special - again.  Dessert was apple pie a la mode.  That was actually very nice.  Rich, flaky, great crust.  Not sure this place can justify the prices without a bit more flavor."}
{"text":"The food was good but the hostess who I believe is one of the owners was rude. We had our two kids and she gave them each a twisty toy but when we asked if they had kids menu she said \"no this is a fine dining restaurant,\" in a smug way. It's not fine dining if you have to tell people it's fine dining. We actually dine out at fine restaurants often and they cater to children just fine. She was condescending in implying that a fine dining restaurant wouldn't offer a kids menu. I hardly ever write reviews but i thought she was rude and it would have been fine if she had just said they didnt have a kids menu but to imply that such a nice restaurant would never offer such a thing was just plain rude, especially when she doesn't know what she's talking about. The waiter took a long time to come take our order. I finished my plate and they didn't pre-bus the table and take my plate away. We will not return."}
{"text":"Recommended by a local, this place is feels very authentically Italian.  Though the situation did not allow us to partake in wines, it seemed like there was a decent selection.  For starters, we had the wild mushroom soup and a burrata cheese caprese-like appetizer.  Both very good, but the wild mushroom soup was fantastic.    For main courses, we had the papardelle and the parchment steamed whole fish.  The whole fish had a show with the chef coming to the table to debone the fish for us.  It was a fun affair, but being asian and eating whole fish all my life, I could have probably deboned it better.    All in all, the price was reasonable, the service friendly, and the food memorable.  Definitely a place to try outside the typical Vegas fare."}
{"text":"We were given a Groupon by a friend to check out Gaetano's. We never go to Henderson so it was nice to make a trip out that way. I love Italian food, obviously, so I was excited to try a new place. It was a pretty slow Sunday night and we were seated fairly quickly. Nice traditional italian menu and I would call it an \"upscale casual\" restaurant. I was impressed with the \"Specials\" they offered, however there were several options and they were all so detailed that by the time the server finished explaining them all I couldn't remember what most of them were. Would be nice to have them printed up somewhere on the table. On to the food: We ordered the burrata cheese salad which was one of the appetizer specials. It was a delicious little salad. Emphasis on \"little\". For the price it definitely was a bit small. We love burrata cheese so were excited to have some as it is difficult to find. There was one small piece on the salad and since we split it, it wasn't much. I believe it was around $11-12 dollars too which for an appetizer salad is pricey. Good, but pricey! I ordered linguini with red clam sauce as my entree, my absolute favorite dish to order at any Italian restaurant. It was very tasty and made just right. Quick note for one of the servers assistants... when a guest asks for parmesean cheese, they don't need you to tell them \"oh, I wouldn't put it on that\" .... just get me the cheese. Thanks :) All in all, good experience, nice servers and well maintained restaurant. Doubt I'll be back but that's only because it's pretty far from me and I can get good Italian close to home."}
{"text":"YUMMMY!!! WOW!! See you soon!  My wife and I came to Gaetano's a few months back based on a friend's recommendation.  Again, we found ourselves discussing this spectacular cuisine, delightful ambiance and professional service only a few days ago.  Nick was our server-extraordinaire, he was not only generous with his time and wisdom, but thoughtful, informative and added a personal touch to each and every aspect of our meal.  We can not wait to return for our next experience! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was unique and excellent, but an air of arrogance left us disappointed.  Bearing a coupon for 1/2 off second meal means you must be segregated from others in your party...no exceptions.  Seems like a stupid, customer-insensitive rule that only takes up more tables.  In an otherwise vacant restaurant at 6pm, we were seated next to a noisy party group.  The waiter couldn't have cared less when we complained.  If management thinks they are so great, why do they resort to printing coupons?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, some friends took us here and we loved it. I highly reccomend trying the special coffee drink they have, amazing that it is all liquor and tastes like a hot coffee, awesome place......food is awesome and so is the vibe"}
{"text":"My daughter is a regular at this restaurant. No complaints about the food. Complaint is regarding customer service of owner. He went to every table 2 times at least passing us by and never once stopped to say hi or ask if everything was ok! Again...we are regulars and spend our money there. Then when it was time to pay, this woman gave us the bill and stood behind us until we pulled out a credit card. Talk about awkward..... We felt like 2 nd rate customers. I'm taking a break from this restaurant. Yes, I'm a disgruntled customer!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the quality & quantity of food you get. I had purchased a groupon & we went last Friday. The place was not very busy which was surprising for a Friday night but according to some of the other yelp reviews, not unusual.  We ordered the calamari & fried artichokes for our appetizers. The calamari was $13 & the portion was tiny. The fried artichokes were either canned or jarred artichokes which I could not believe. At a restaurant like that, it's completely ridiculous to use any kind of canned ingredients. My husband got the veal with mushrooms & I got one of their specials, Chilean Sea Bass. My husbands veal was nothing special & the sauce had a weird texture to it. My sea bass was good but the accompanying side of orzo with different veggies in some type of sauce was very boring & unimaginative.  Very forgettable meal & we won't be going back. I can think of at least 3 other Italian restaurants that blow this place out of the water."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!   Family-owned and you meet almost the whole family.   The food is divine, the wine....so fine!   Couldn't recommend a better Italian spot in LV!"}
{"text":"The owners of this establishment are the strangest, most bizarre I've ever seen they watch you from a distance and they yelled at my date telling her that she did not know how to eat her food properly because she asked for crushed red pepper. I would eat there much more if they weren't so rude.   Also, another experience I had there when a friend had a Groupon you could tell the lady owner was not happy and we even presented the coupon before we ordered, as if that should make any difference on how they prepare it.  I've never felt a more bizarre dynamic in a food establishment in my life."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and was very disappointed. Food was hot but portions not great. One part of the order was fettuccine alfredo with meatballs - had one meatball!! - for $24 come on!! there are other Italian restaurants just as good and much better value. Wanted to try somewhere different, was tasty but way overpriced for pasta. Will not be going back..."}
{"text":"Absolutely top notch. Staff is exceptional, food is even better. I was a little scared of coming here at first, because of the prices, but after eating here I can confidently say it's well worth it.   The ravioli I ordered was without a doubt, the best I've ever eaten.   This place is amazing in every aspect, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"First of all let me say this place was a disappointment, looks really nice and the servers were nice but the person  greeting us was absolutely disrespectful. We walked in and she said \"hi, how many?\" And as she looked at us she said \"oh would you like to look at the menu before I sit you down?\" As if we were not able to pay for the food and she wanted to make sure we saw the prices before she walked a few steps to give us a table! Once we were at our table and our food was served I realized we were better off going to the place next door !! Food was so plain and flavorless !  I've been to San Francisco ca, Monterey ca and Los Ángeles and this place doesn't even come close to it!! Really sad I was thinking about the ciopinno for the past week and I was so disappointed! Well never again will I go there ! I will have to look for another place next time I visit Henderson again!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for a nice meal before a night out on the town. We only came because I had a gift certificate. So glad we did! The service was IMPECCABLE and the food was delicious. The salad was perfectly dressed, the bred was fresh (even at 9pm) and the wine was perfectly chilled. My husband had the chicken piccata and it was awesome. I had the pork rolls with homemade gnocchi and although the pork itself was a touch dry (that's what you get when you order the braised pork special late in the evening) I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The owner chatted with us before our departure and we told him we would definitely be back! It is special occasion only prices for us, but I'll keep this place in mind for sure!"}
{"text":"well, well ,well...where do I begin? As soon as you walk in the door you are greeted by an old lady who gives off an air of judgement and indifference. She acts more like a gatekeeper than an ambassador! She really set the tone for the evening and unfortunately it wasn't good. It was also my birthday and I really felt slighted by her and the staff in general. The restaurant is beautiful. It is a shame that at 7pm in the evening the place was empty. I would assume it has a lot to do with the fact that they are very expensive and the portions are so disappointing. I mean wow...unless you buy a Groupon discount and really pace yourself, you can't help but feel ripped off!  WE HAD TO BEG FOR A BASKET OF BREAD! That's right...after sitting for over 30 minutes we were still not provided any and we had to get up to find the busboy to get us some. The staff is not terrible but are slow and I guess take their lead from the old lady who insists that everyone be miserable.  The food is blah, Rigatoni Bolognese was so hot temperature-wise you couldn't taste it. The Gnochetti Sardi was half a plate of blandness but the little sausage you got was good. The Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was so disappointing. The Cioppino fish stew over pasta for almost $50 was more like hospital food...so bland and the seafood ingredients were just not there.  All in all....I suggest you go elsewhere for Italian. We are regulars at Don Vito's in the South Point, we also go to Casa Di Amore where the bill never is less than $275 but the staff is awesome and the food is filling.  To close...I never go to a restaurant and not get at least one bottle wine but this place will force you to alter your dining habits. I'll pay more for good service and a sense of value for the experience but I still had a $250 check at Gaetano's and we cut back due to the overall negative time and experience. But hey...you be the judge!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Gaetano's to celebrate our two year wedding anniversary. We both tried dishes outside our comfort zone: I tried the asparagus risotto with scallops (a special) and he had the mezzaluna veal ravioli. We were not disappointed! The food had bold flavors that balanced well and made us glad to have tried something new. We also ordered dessert: he tried the tiramisu and I tried the chocolate mousse cake. DELICIOUS! More importantly, though, the service was fantastic! Gaetano himself and his son both assisted us throughout the meal. The restaurant has a really cool balance between a family-owned local place and an upscale dining experience. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmark list for years ! We finally tried this place Saturday night as a double date with some of Yelp's finest - Lisa L. and Eric R. I will definitely be coming back again in the future - it's by far the best Italian I've had in Henderson.   I agree with everyone that says Gaetano's needs to print a Specials menu! The list of 15 specials was so complicated even our waiter couldn't keep it straight. I love that they have specials, but the confusion of listening to soo many and trying to remember them was annoying.   We started with beef carpaccio (YUM) and a pretty mediocre bottle of wine. Although I don't blame Gaetano's for the wine - that's my fault for picking the wrong one :)  I had a 1/2 order of the chicken ravioli and a caprese salad for my main. The chicken ravioli was really good - definitely seemed homemade. The caprese was pretty awful. The mozzarella was yummy, but the olive oil was bland, there was no balsalmic, and they called it \"Caprese con pepperoni\" (I guess I'm an idiot for thinking \"con pepperoni\" implies there is pepperoni in the dish?). They had a huge pile of slimy red peppers in the middle and lots of onions. It was a weird rendition of a Caprese - not one I'd ever order again.   My husband on the other hand got one of the best Italian dishes I've had in my life! I had major jealousy that he got to eat such fabulous food while I was picking at my weird Caprese! It was veal stuffed pasta in a cream sauce with proscuitto and peas. It comes with mushrooms but my freakshow of a husband had them leave those out. Seriously this pasta was incredible!!! Even without the mushrooms this pasta was SO GOOD. The veal was so tender and perfectly flavored. Next time I guess we'll just be getting 2 orders of this fabulousness!!  A wonderful evening with friends and great food. Service was so-so, but the veal stuffed pasta will have me coming back!! Thank goodness it isn't a special and seems to be on the menu full time."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food mediocre. Charged excessively for plate splitting and they didn't even split the plates.  Ended up being WAY overpriced after the upcharged. We wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times, and tonight will be the last time I will ever go there. I sat at the bar where I  usually do to have my meal and a few drinks. You can see the bartender was rushed and a little upset that he had to train someone new but the new girl was very nice and kind. When I asked him if I get a side order of something for half price with a full entree, he seemed annoyed with me and never even gave me an answer. I finally asked the girl would you please go back and check for me, and he interrupted so rudely and said,\" I said you could.\"Well he never told me that. Then I asked for the menu because I wanted a glass of wine, I had already finished my martini and my Caesar salad. Some new guest came and sat next to me and the bartender said to me ,what this place is a mess you need to clean yourself up. I need to clean my stuff up? You're the bartender you need to clear the plates and the glass and meanwhile I've been waiting for a glass of wine for the last 10 minutes. He was so obnoxious and so rude I asked to get my order to go. I will never ever go to this establishment again. I guess that is why they give out the restaurant.com coupons as an incentive to go there because otherwise the place will be empty. All I wanted was an apology, \" I'm sorry\" from someone, and I didn'tGet it. I will never go back and my friends will never go there either. Instead of enjoying my evening out, I ended up having to take my food to go and cry on the way home because they made me feel so bad. This is one horrible restaurant which I will never ever go back to."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a lovely dinner st Gaetano's  Restorante. I enjoyed the Chicken  Marsala  after enjoying the bean soup... Both quite ample and tasty. My wife had the lobster bisque and Chicken Picotta Both excellent. The Italian style cheese cake was very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place; we go once or twice a month on the average.  Gaetano's is great Italian food with an excellent wine list.  Best of all, Gaetano's is in our neighborhood!  The food has great flavor. Meats are always served to our desired doneness. Seafood and poultry items on the menu are juicy and tender. Pasta is cooked al dente while the sauces always make me want to lick my plate clean!  I love listening to their specials although you can't go wrong ordering from the menu. I recommend the burrata, the baked artichoke stuffed with Parmesan (an occasional special), the mushroom soup (also a special) and caprese for starters, the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini for pasta, and the Ossobuco alla Milanese for your entree, the tiramisu for dessert paired with THE cappuccino (not the regular one but the owner's own recipe).  Then again, like I said, you can't go wrong with any item from the menu.  I most especially like the feeling that the restaurant exudes.  You can certainly feel the welcome from the family that runs the place. The service is very personal. Nick who is often our server, treats us very well.  I also enjoy small talks with his father who is usually the host for the evening when he comes around to the tables. The floor plan and lighting make you feel cozy. It is not too small as to constrict you nor is it too big that it loses the intimacy.  I can come in shorts and flip-flops or in a little black satin dress and I'd be fine.  They send you a gift certificate for a free dinner to celebrate your birthday which is redeemable within your birth month. They often email you discount coupons too.  Occasionally, the restaurant will have set dinner menu pairing events hosted by wineries which are well worth the price because they are often generous with their pours and with pour refills.  From appetizers to desserts, Gaetano's is a hearty meal for its value. You pay not only for the quality and the decent sized portion of food, but also for the service, and the ambiance."}
{"text":"That's exactly what Gaetanos is a true 5 star restaurant. Everytime I eat there it is the best gastronomic experience that allows your taste buds to just flourish and makes your stomach feel satisfy, and I Dont mean just once. I have been going there for years not one flaw. The appetizers are amazing from the stuffed figs stuffed with goat cheese that are wrapped around with prosciutto di Parma just fabulous! The veal chop is so good and tender.  The pastas are all wonderful. The meat and chicken dishes along with the sea bass special all fantastic! There is too much to mention. You must go and find out for yourself. The best dining experience in all Las Vegas!! Marianne Foti"}
{"text":"We came here with our friends from Texas who live here part time. The restaurant is nice looking,The service was excellent. I ordered the Rolatine Di Melanzane alla Siciliana, grilled eggplant stuffed with capellini. Bor-ing! What was I thinking???? I don't even like angel hair pasta and I am a self proclaimed pasta aficionado, my family was in the import business in San Francisco of Italian specialty foods, meats, cheeses, pastas, olive oils etc. back in the day...and we owned Florence Ravioli & Delicatessan in North Beach so yes, I am a total snob when it comes to Italian food, so with that said, the restaurant was pretty ok, my friends were full and happy, if I do ever come back, I'll order the ravioli, and see how that's done."}
{"text":"The food was just so good! Usually I can resist the bread, but their bread was so fresh and chewy that I had to have some! The cioppino was amazing, with Maine lobster, and a generous amount of mussels and clams. They had a good gluten-free pasta for my husband as well, so he got to have pasta too. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I'm in Las Vegas visiting my cousin after a stay at the Monte Carlo. In Henderson we ate at an Italian Ristorante named Gaetanos.  Inside was well appointed ,the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous . We had appetizers soup entres and dessert. Salad was very good soup was monster portion, my entre was homemade pasta with mushrooms and peas in a cream sauce. Outstanding . Lemon gelato was the perfect ending.  If ever in Henderson Nevada give this delightful place a chance. You won't be disappointed .  Oh by the way we have the same last name."}
{"text":"I am adding my comments to tag with JANET N'S comment on 12/21/14, I was  the person who brought the Groupon. Had the Waiter taken our coupons when we offered them to him at the beginning of service, we all could have avoided the embarrassment and humiliation we endured.  The so called Mrs. Manager /Hostess was rude, and both Mgr. and Waiter continued to act inappropriately by returning to our table to voice their opinions to us. In addition, the Waiter placed an 18% service charge (mind you we are only a party of 4) on our check, assuming that he deserved it. Two more negatives: 1). The 7 up we ordered, was never replaced as the BAR ran out of 7 up-it was 5 pm when the restaurant opened that they ran out of soda?  2). The restaurant did not serve fresh grated Parmesan cheese. That was shocking considering the price point and the theme of the restaurant indicating Italian food served.  Not a great Christmas Dinner experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was small but delicious and authentic. The service was phenomenal and the staff was super cool. It has definitely become my top favorite Italian place. The restaurant was beautiful and in a very nice shopping center."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Gaetano's for the first time tonight. The food was amazing and the service was awesome! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Eh, just Ok. I picked this place because my husbands name in Italian is Gaetano. We walked in and I was immediately impressed. The decor was nice and calm. We were seated and it took quite a few minutes for the busser to come. He acted annoyed when I said regular water was OK instead of bottled. The same annoyed busser brought bread and slammed it down on the table. My husband said it was great though. Our food came reasonably quickly. It was a very modest portion. I am on a fairly strict diet and my appetite is not currently huge. I ordered chicken picatta. It was good, but not great. It was what I call a showgirl portion. After I ate every bite I was still hungry and could have gone elsewhere after. My husband order chicken parm. He said it tasted good, and the sauce on the pasta was great. But the chicken was soggy. He was not full or satisfied after dinner either. We had 2 chicken entrees and 2 glasses of wine. The bill was $68 before the tip. rather pricey to leave still wanting something else. It was OK, but as usual in Vegas there will be no return."}
{"text":"First time here with my family and it was amazing! The food was exquisite and was served very nicely. The people here are super nice. The food is delicious and will make you want to come back for more. If I had a choice to come back, I would say \"yes\" immediately. I highly recommend this place ."}
{"text":"I was a happy camper here!  Definitely a locals place!  I have a standing date night with my friend from elementary school on Tuesday nights so we are always contemplating new places to eat that are b/w where he lives and my house.  We stumbled upon this place based on a Groupon they had offered, it had good reviews, so we decided to try it.  People were up a the bar watching the Heat finals, which looked rather comfortable, and has been added to my places to watch games that don't involve gambling. I ordered a dirty martini on the rocks [very good] he ordered a cranberry and vodka that came out looking like pink lemonade b/c they pour heavy here!!! {A+}  I got the Burrata salad which just makes me grin from ear to ear. My friend actually got the Gazpacho which shocked the shit out of me, as that was very daring for him, and he ate it all. I was allowed to have one tasty bite and that was it.  Bread basket arrived with all sorts of wholesome goodness in there-got to love carbs.  I ordered butternut squash ravioli and he got pork chop stuffed w/ Mortadella, cheese, pistachios, and raisins..It was pretty dang amazing. Mine was very good too. We left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant based on 80% off Restaurant.com and then we researched reviews.  We were so impressed with our experience at this establishment.  The owner (wife) checked us in and was so nice to our daughter.  The owner (husband) showed us to our table.  The place is beautifully decorated. The menu had amazing choices.  We had bread, calamari for an appetizer, I had the special Stuffed Salmon with crabmeat and my husband have Ribeye and my daughter had penne pasta with butter and a side of veggies.  My husbands drinks were reasonalbly priced and the staff was very attentive.  The son of the owners was the waiter and had a wonderful personality.  We had a wonderful experience here and will go back again without my daughter.  My daughter played \"Fancy Nancy\" for the night but she said she wanted to go to AppleBees next time so we will go on a date night just the two of us.  We LOVED everything about Gaetano's Ristorante.  You should check it out!  :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I got the groupon deal and love to try new places. The food was good, but I can't say it's the best Italian food I ever had. Our server did a excellent job the night that we went. I can only give 4 stars because the lady at the front was on her tablet and didn't know we had been standing there. She did apologize however just not a good first impression. I will most likely give them another try."}
{"text":"We decided on Gaetano's for dinner as I had been wanting Italian for a while. We got there right as they opened, so there was no wait. The dining room is cavernous and very well decorated. Of note is it seems the owners take cruises - due to some of the artwork. Nice white tablecloths and well-appointed servers show this is a serious Italian place. Sadly, I cannot remember our servers names, but they were fantastic. We never had to seek them out and they were always around to care for our table.   We started with an appetizer that they were featuring that night. Fresh mozzarella with greens and tomatoes and a balsamic reduction. The mozz was certainly fresh and worked very well with the greens and balsamic. I am not much for tomatoes, co the wife took one for the team and had those while I made up for it with the greens.   For our entrees, I went with the lasagna and the wife had the Mussels and Clams Brodetto. The lasagna was very good, with soft noodles, creamy béchamel and good red sauce. It lacked a bit on meat (it is listed as Bolognese) and cheese topping. It is served in the usual casserole dish - a little trick here: use some water to wet the doily....it will keep the dish from sliding around. It appears to be constructed in the dish itself, which could lead to why it wasn't spectacular. I am used to layers: pasta, meat, sauce, cheese, pasta, meat, sauce, cheese...etc. This had layers, but it ended up blended together in such a way as to be an amalgamation. Again, a tick more meat in the red sauce and some cheese on top would have moved it to the next level.  The brodetto was great. A nice big bowl with mussels and clams swimming in a great seafood broth. Granted, this was an app she ordered as her entrée, it stepped up to fill the roll nicely. There were about a half dozen each of the shellfish. The broth was warm, silky and loaded with seafood flavor. It was almost too flavorful...almost.  There is nothing like dunking toasted bread in seafood broth after eating everything else!  We are intrigued about their eggplant dish and how well they do with their rigatoni. For that we will be back. This is certainly not a place to go to just to get some grub. Go when you want to have a nice Italian dinner in a nice place with some nice people."}
{"text":"Molto bueno!   I am always looking for a great Italian restaurant.  I have found some quality places in town, but they were not perfect.  I think that Gaetano's is the closest I have found to perfect in town.  I lived in Italy when I was younger; thus, I am an Italian food snob where I turn down my nose at those chain places.    DH and I went last night.  Groupon offered a great deal, but they also have deals on their website.  I have a glass of pinot grigio, the pear and pecan salad, and gnoochi con gorgonzola.  The rate of how good an Italian restaurant is whether they have gnoochi and how good it is.  While, admittedly, my gorgonzola sauce is better, it's the best I have had in Las Vegas.  Also, the gnoochi was perfect little dumplings from heaven.  DH had the portabello mushrooms app and ravioli entree.  He enjoyed both, but said he would try a different pasta next time.  I had a tiny bit of his mushrooms and found them to be yummy.  I have to say that I completely ignored his main dish because I was too focused on my gnoochi.  While I didn't finish my gnoochi (dinner tonight!), I had a cup of cappuccino before leaving.  The taste was perfect!    Fantastic memories of Italy were brought to mind when dinning at this fine establishment.  We will definiately be returning!  Staff was friendly.  Kept DH's drink full, offered more bread, and generally checked on us regularly.  One note for groupon users: they automatically added 18% tip on bill, which was fine with me, but FYI."}
{"text":"Came here one night because we had a restaurant.com certificate and it was so close to our home.  There were some hits and misses in this meal but the hits were really exceptional.  A lot of people here gush at the laundry list of specials they have every day, but there were so many of them, it was difficult to remember.  I wished they would take the effort to print a daily special menu.  I felt like I should have brought a pen and paper with me to take notes as the waiter recited all the specials.  We ordered the arugula and beet and the Mediterranean salads off the specials menu.  Between the bread (homemade fococcia, yum) and the salad being so big, I was full by the time the main course appeared at the table.  The salads are expensive at like $14 or so, but I don't think they are meant to be eaten alone.  I wished they would slash the price and scale down the salads, as $14 for an appetizer salad is too expensive.  They were both very good, just too much.  We also split a half order of the homemade spinach and cheese ravioli with marinara sauce, it was one of the highlights of the meal.  Really exceptional.    I ordered the Hawaiian pink snapper special and my husband had the gnocchi.  The snapper was good but didn't think it was worth the $27 they charged for it.  It's the first time I've ever eaten that type fish, and maybe I'm naive as to how much the fish costs to bring in the area, but it wasn't a memorable dish.  A few weeks before I had the sea bass and risotto from Brand and felt that was a much more well cooked dish than this.  The potatoes with the meal had no seasoning (at $27 dollars I would expect the seasoning to be spot on) but the asparagus was very good.  Husband had the gnocchi and said it was nowhere in the same league as the ravioli, and while it was good, would not order it again over the ravioli.  I would come here again, as there is so much variety and the food is very fresh.  But we'll order less food."}
{"text":"This place is authentic Italian.  The owner even has the accent.  He is from Sicily and runs the place with his family.  The food is made with olive oil, not butter.  They offer fresh variety of fish every day.  The sauces again,  all healthy.  We have eaten here at least ten times and NEVER been disappointed.  Ask for Danny, their son, he is a great server and has an amazing personality."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian I've ever had. Prior to this place, my fav. was the Stinkin Roses in S.F. but Gaetano really raised the bar. I literally had a dream of the clam linguini I had couple nights after :) What a gem I found through Groupon. I definitely will be back, coupon or not!"}
{"text":"My wife found this restaurant on Groupon, and we have eaten there at least almost 20 times since then.  Every time we go my wife has an internal struggle whether or not to eat the freshmade gnocchi.  My wife spent some time in Italy during college and is an Italian food snob.  I on the other hand do not have an internal struggle, I always get ravioli.  My wife and I love it here.  We go on special occasions or just drop in cause we are hungry and they always have table, but never look empty.  All the servers are great and know their stuff.  Rarely in all the times I have been there, have I not seen the owner walking around the tables, checking on diners and greeting.  This is one of the few restaurants I offer as suggestions to friends, and they have always reported back they loved, and some have become regulars themselves."}
{"text":"Twice. Twice I've been lured in by the amazing food, impeccable service and lovely atmosphere of Gaetano's. This little gem is located off Eastern between 5 Guys and Buffalo Wild Wings.   Nick has been our server both times and he's very knowledgable about the food, wine, and culture of Italy - because he's been there.   Look, the food is amazing, the wine list complete and affordable, and it's family owned which satisfies this girl's need to support the independent business.   Get to Gaetano's!! Why are you still reading this review? GO!"}
{"text":"So this is supposed to be a top notch restaurant. But I guess they don't care about their customers. Their hours are supposed to be till 10 p.m. I came in at 8:50,my friend was not quite there yet and I asked the bartender if they were still serving food just to be sure and he said let me check and he came back and said, \" oh our Chef wants to close since it's slow so unless you're going to order right now they aren't serving anymore.   So sad because I actually do really like this place but I might question now coming back because that's an hour and 10 minutes before they're supposed to close and we were just going to sit at the bar and order something and get some wine.   Guess they don't care if they lose customers or not."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. The service was great, and the woman serving us was beyond friendly and helpful. Their garlic bites are amazing, and they have a pretty extensive menu. The dish I ordered was great, and you get quite a bit for your money, with the main dishes at least. Also got a canoli to take home, and it was delicious as well.  Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I visited Gaetano's Ristorante, looking to use the Groupon I'd received as a gift. I spoke with the owner's son, Nick (the name I was given when I called), told him of my Groupon and asked if I could order to go. Nick rudely says, \"No you can't! It says that on the Groupon.\" I paused because I'd never been spoken to like that at a restaurant. I then asked if I could use my Groupon now because I didn't make a reservation and he says, \"Oh, you want to eat now?\" After I tell him yes, (if I could get a table), he gives me this lecture... \"Just to let you know you can't take any food to go, you actually have to sit down and eat it, that's what it says on the Groupon, so if you try to take any food home, we won't let you!\" I told him, \"Ok! I get it!\" I looked at the little older woman standing next to him to see what his problem was and she wouldn't meet my eye. How could you treat one of your customers like this? I literally felt like I didn't belong there and Nick made it quite clear that he felt the same way. I sat at a table by myself wanting to cry. I did absolute nothing wrong except try to redeem a Groupon. How dare he treat me like I'm nothing?! I'm a person that deserves to be treated like a human! I've contacted Groupon to get a refund because I don't want to go through that again. I hated that experience. If he treated me like sh**, I can't imagine how he treats his employees. I get your mommy or daddy owns the place, but you have no right to treat your customers like they're beneath you. I'm sure their food is fantastic, but I never got to that part because I left. The best part of that experience was the waitress that treated me like I was worth something. She was really sweet to me when she saw that I was upset; I almost wanted to come back after I spoke with her and I wish I could remember her name. I don't know who treats people the way the owner's son treated me today, but I will NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"Be prepared to take your time with this dining experience. The waiters are really knowledgeable and it is spectacular how they ramble off their daily specials like it's a second language, including intricate entree details. The food is all made to order which adds to your dining time, but it's so worth the wait. Since it is also made to order, its customizable. If you don't see something on the menu, simply ask. I was able to receive a child's portion of fettuccine Alfredo with ease! There is not one bad thing I can say about this place..great food, great people, we will plan another visit in the future!"}
{"text":"The service is outstanding and the food is even better. I have a new appreciation for the quality of the food as well as the authentic style Gaetano applies to his cooking. I loved this place before I traveled to Italy and I'm more impressed with the food after I spent 5 days trying authentic Italian food.   This is a place I would recommend to anyone who doesn't want to pay \"Vegas Strip\" prices, but enjoys the quality of fine food."}
{"text":"My son and I dined here tonight and what a fabulous experience. Angel, our water was attentive and friendly and the food was amazing. How did I not know about this place until now??  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Gaetano's in years and decided to try it again. The food that we had was good but VERY expensive. The clams and muscles appetizer was tasty but the clams and muscles were so few and so very tiny. My husband usually loves Cioppino and was excited to know it was on the menu until he found out it was a $40 entree. We were in the heart of San Francisco and only paid $29 for Cioppino. We thought it was very overpriced for a Henderson restaurant but if you had a 2 for 1 coupon it would be worth it!!"}
{"text":"Really good Italian.  Everything we ordered we enjoyed without complaint.  The service was quick and attentive.  I had the veal parmigiana, and it was tender and perfectly breaded.  The rest of my family ordered a Shrimp dish, a Caprese salad, and an avocado salad.  Everyone was very happy with their choices.  It is worth the drive out to this restaurant if you're in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"Gaetano's has been known as one of the best Italian places in Henderson for some time now but I'd have to disagree.    Décor Gaetano's décor is intimate and dark with some nice music lightly playing in the background. I loved the ambience and believe it is the perfect setting to grab a bottle of wine and bring a date or just catch up with some old friends. That I liked.  Service Our server was very informative and polite, however outside of that the service was subpar.  We had to constantly request basic things like a spoon for soup, a refill on drinks, or make an attempt to flag the server down to ask for bread and to place our meal orders. For a place at this price point I expected some type of attentive service and wasn't even greeted with mediocre service. Considering that the restaurant only had about 15 people in it, it's unclear as to why service was so poor.  It was also interesting to read how other Yelpers commented on the owner visiting the tables and introducing himself. Strangely, we watched as he went to every table but ours. Perhaps we weren't dressed appropriately, perhaps he didn't see us (despite there being only about 6 parties in the entire dining room) or perhaps he just didn't like us. Either way I would have to say that him snubbing us for whatever his reason was unprofessional and unfortunate.  Food We had the calamari, the stuffed salmon, mushroom soup and the cioppini. Honestly, there's nothing to rave about here, I can't even really say it was \"meh\", basic meals with nothing that exceptionally stood out. The mushroom had a variety of mushrooms blended with a bit of truffle oil in the middle. It was interesting and you could taste the variety of mushrooms in the soup, which was nice.  But outside of that I have had better calamari at Buon Gusto, better cioppini at the Oyster Bar at Southpoint and way better salmon at Off the Strip and Panevino. How is this the best Italian in Las Vegas? It's not even top 5. Maybe they were having an off day but I have no idea why people think this place is the best Italian place in the city.  Bottom Line: Is Gaetano's the best Italian in Las Vegas? No. They're not even the best restaurant on their block. I would much rather travel the extra 30 seconds to Buon Gusto on Eastern and Horizon Ridge Parkway or Montesano's a couple minutes  down by St. Rose and have a better experience and meal."}
{"text":"Food is great, better than Ventano and handmade pasta.  Very pricey, affordable with a groupon. Only annoying part was the 18% auto gratuity for a party of 2.  I agree with the other reviewer:  I would have tipped more had they not included the auto gratuity."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted \"real\" italian. Not out of the box dried pasta like Ventanos.  Service was great. The owner was the first to greet us. Our server was kind and there  if we needed anything.  There wasn't much of a crowd considering it was a tuesday and our food came fast. Low lighting and soft music. GREAT food!  I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I will start out with the disclaimer that I lived in Italy for 6 glorious months and, consequently, I am a total Italian food snob. I found out about this place from a friend and I was especially pleased to find them on restaurant.com. So my husband and I printed our $50 gift certificate and headed out on a Friday night. I started the meal with the best cosmo I have ever had, it was definitely strong but I didn't taste any alcohol. The bartender is masterful! I then moved on to the bread basket on the table. The regular bread was delicious and warm. There was also an herb, almost pizza looking bread that I was not very fond of, but I am sure somebody enjoys it. I did notice that other tables were getting bruschetta as well as bread, but I got the feeling they were \"regulars,\" but it made me feel left out! We moved on to appetizers. I had the caprese salad, which has roasted peppers and onions on it. I was surprised how well the whole thing worked, given its non-traditional nature. I would definitely recommend it! For the main courses, I had the papardelle with filet and my husband had the trout special. The pasta was delightful and the filet was melt in your mouth delicious, but the dish was missing something. It was earthy and rustic but there was a flavor profile missing for sure. The trout was well cooked, but the skin of the fish was not at all crispy and we felt it should have been. It came with a side of pasta that was delicious! Since we had the restaurant.com coupon we decided to go all out and get a dessert. We decided to go out on a limb and try the Sicilian cannoli. The cannoli was almost inedible. It has an overwhelming lemon flavor and is just very off-putting texturally.   The service was wonderful, until the end of the meal. The restaurant had filled up very fast and people were asking to be seated in our server's section. The poor man was running from table to table! It took us over 15 minutes to get someone to swipe our credit card so we could leave, but other than that small ordeal the service was impeccable. Overall, it was a mixed bag for us. I have had better Italian food in Las Vegas, but I may give this another try sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Gnocchi was so good! Everything was great, make sure to make a reservation though! Awesome food & service.. Plus it's family owned, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"There is no more authentic Italian in the West of the US! In every respect: family, homemade, service, quality, price. Eat here."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the food at this place.  I find it terribly overpriced and very mediocre.  The owner is a salesman and would not trust anything he says or does.    Ate here with a group of 10 people.  Steaks were overcooked, short ribs were of fast food quality, veal was as thick as prepackaged Hormel lunch meat.  Too many other good restaurants to go back to this place.  Owner is a bit of a creep as well."}
{"text":"Service is exceptional and personalized - (Nick is outstanding!  Mr. Gaetano himself visited our table!), the Food is of amazing quality+always fresh, daily specials have never disappointed us, this is our place to come for a special night out dining!  We will return!"}
{"text":"We ate at Gaetano's last night.  Mr. Gaetano was not working last night but he has two sons that do.  The waiter (the loud son) was engaging and passionate about the food and the off menu specials.  We started with a buffalo mozzarella salad that was very tender and fresh.  We shared a stuffed artichoke that was delicious and reminded me of my grandmothers.  We ordered a rib eye (with all the fat cut off), veal rav, veal parm and eggplant pasta dish.  All were great."}
{"text":"Like a few others, we took advantage of the Restaurant.com GC and are very happy to have found a great italian restaurant.... away from the strip.  My husband and I dined on a Saturday and chose to sit at the bar where Zachary rolled out excellent customer service.  First, the cocktails he mixes up are dangerously delicious. Second, I was craving risotto - but wasn't to thrilled about their risotto dishes on the menu.  Zachary said the restaurant would accommodate us and asked me what I normally like with my risotto.   A short while later - I had my risotto dish with shrimp and asparagus.  The dish was simply divine! Perfectly cooked risotto which is always so hard to find.  We also had the butternut squash ravioli, home made rigatoni with sausage and and the tiramisu with Gaetano's special hot chocolate. Mr. Gaetano himself was walking around greeting guests! My husband and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was a great dining experience!!! The staff were so professional it made it feel like we were special guests in their own home. The food was amazing. Great fresh tasting. Water was always at the table and the wait staff always came around. Most importantly this place is extremely clean ESPECIALLY the bathrooms. Definitely coming back here again. Ciao"}
{"text":"I was actually a little flabbergasted when I stepped into this restaurant. Who knew such an Italian gem of a restaurant was nesseled in this unassuming strip mall in Henderson?  At first I thought I was a little underdressed for this restaurant. They have white table cloths and the whole setup of wine/water glasses, silverware etc. I felt like I needed to dress up a little bit before I stepped in there. Turns out, I was fine with whatever I was wearing (casual button up with jeans). That's great because I was hungry!  They started off our dinner with a bread basket with 3 different kinds of bread. They also had a balsamic/olive oil dipping plate for our warm toasty bread, that came hot out of the oven.  I took some recommendations from the waiter, Danny. He is definitely a great waiter and just a stand up guy to talk to. He will chat and explain the menu in detail and answer any questions for you. I took a once over of the menu and realized that fried calamari was on their appetizer and had to try it. I was also torn between the Butternut squash ravioli and the homemade Lasagna (both homemade made from scratch in house). I took Danny's recommendation and tried the Lasagna, and I was not dissappointed.   The Lasagna was so flavorful. Each layer was perfectly cooked and almost melted in your mouth when you took a bite. The cheese that was melted on top was just right and not overcooked. Their sauce was aboslutely delicious and the portion size was just right.   The calamari was definitely the best I have ever had in Vegas. The batter was not too overwhelming and the crunch was slight and the calamari had great texture. A+ for their lemon half being a mesh package so that the seeds don't fall out over the calamari when squeezing the juice out of it. The little things that make it special.  After dinner, I sat here in amazement by the absolute attention to detail this place has given their food. The dedication to their food is noticeable in their presentation and their taste of each dish presented. Their service was always on par with plates being cleared and water being refilled. I would highly recommend anyone in the area to try this restaurant. If you have seen it before and just passed it by, please don't and try it for yourselves. I don't think you will be disappointed.  Take a date, bring a friend, bring family. You will love it."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon to Gaetano's. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night around 7 and the restaurant was about half empty.   First thing, service was slow. We had a reservation, and we were seated immediately, but we had been sitting awhile before our drink orders were taken. And then when they were, it took awhile for them to get to the table and for our waiter to come back to get our appetizer order.  We got our appetizers fairly quickly. However, there were 35+ minutes between the time we finished our apps and received our main course. During this time I think a busser came over to refill our water, but otherwise didn't see our waiter. I had ordered the gnocchi, which was okay but on the bland side, and my boyfriend ordered the lasagna, which came out cold.   My boyfriend had to work later that evening, and we thought we allowed ourselves plenty of time, but by the time the food came out, we were crunched for time, so we just quickly ate some of our food, boxed up the rest, and left. I wouldn't go back, especially paying full price."}
{"text":"Another well-respected dining emporium that I have wanted to experience for years is Gaetano's.  I finally did so for a dinner out with Henderson friends.  After this delightful culinary experience, I can only ask, \"What took me so long?\"  This elegant ristorante delivered on all counts: great Northern Italian cooking; fine sophisticated service by formally clad dining staff; and excellent hospitality including a greeting and regular table checks by owner Gaetano Palmeri, who embodies the classic image of an experienced hands-on restaurateur with an eye for detail who clearly cares about pleasing his guests.  Not shy about tackling multiple courses at Italian restaurants, I opened with Calamari Fritti for the table, and the calamari was light and golden as desired, with a graciously supplied smooth and dynamite-quality Lemon Aioli per request, along with a tasty Marinara Sauce.  Although I intended to avoid extra carb loading, since I was soon to be leaving on a cruise, I nevertheless could not resist two warm buttered slices of fine Italian bread.  For soup I opted for a bowl of the special soup of the day: Cream of Mushroom Soup with Truffle Oil.  The velvety soup with beautifully pureed mushrooms was smooth and luscious.  I next split an excellent Caesar Salad with fresh Romaine leaves and Focaccia Croutons with the other male at our table, my optometrist friend.  After two bites I realized that I was missing my beloved anchovies in this dish.  So I immediately summoned our server, and in a flash anchovies were brandished in a dish (for an open food charge of just $1.00), and I happily regarded my Caesar as now truly complete.  Fork-tender Vitello Scallopina with great sweet Marsala Sauce was my main, accompanied by delectable Roasted Potatoes and somewhat hard but near al dente broccoli and carrots.  One of our party commented that he experienced the best Gnocchi he had ever tried, and his large Creme Brulee looked very appealing,  But, already filled up by the generous portions, I resisted joining in.  Maybe next time!  For, there will definitely be next times."}
{"text":"Nice place food just ok for the price service Luke any other fine dining room that is empty an hour before closing on the weekend evening if you want a quiet evening with a better service and don't mind paying almost double than olive garden  for the same food that is your place.  The do have some good specials .....but it may come with a risk...lol The location is very inviting the best front in the whole plaza meaby that is the reason that they are in business for almost 16 years and the groupon & restaurant.com  Ps the tinny sushi place next door was 130% to capacity...half hour waiting"}
{"text":"The food was very authentic! The flavor was fabulous on everything that each of us tasted. I would most definitinly go back. Atmosphere is relaxed and classy.  They even accommodated for my picky two year old and her eating habits!  The only prob was the waiter seemed to forget about our appetizer. Then he asked us if we still wanted it ( after we reminded him) after our entrees came out. It was almost as if it was like-- \"oh yea oops my bad here ya go if you want\". For the prices and the atmosphere they are going for you might think he would have handled it a bit more professional.   The owner seemed to care quite a bit about our experience and came over and lightened the air."}
{"text":"We were looking for Italian food one night and decided on Gaetano's although we had to go home and change because we were looking for comfy Italian food.  :)    Zach, our server did an amazing job.  I love when a server asks if they can put in the kids order right away!  Big points added!!  He even brought the kids an extra set of Wiki Stiks which scored even more points.  His suggestions were right on and the food was delicious.    My husband had the eggplant dish which I thought was amazing and I had the pesto pasta which was very good.  The kids enjoyed fettucini alfredo spilt 3 ways which they do charge $5 to do (although there is no kids meals).  The creme brulee was comparable to the creme brulee in Bora Bora - made with real Tahitian vanilla!  OMG amazing!!!  We will be back but probably without the kids."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. A little pricey but good."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian places in the Vegas Valley area (for me, it's right up there with Nora's and Casa di Amore). Most times I'm in here, Gaetano and/or his wife are walking around talking to diners, seating people, taking orders, or monitoring the kitchen activities. Most of the servers are their sons or other family members. The dining room is big; I almost never make a reservation, and even so I've been able to get right in with 1-3 other people on Friday & Saturday evenings without a wait. The food is always amazing, and unlike some other places where the \"specials\" are old food they're trying to get rid of, Gaetano's specials are things he's been able to get a hold of and offer in limited supply, or just something he felt like making on a whim that day. There are always around 10 specials daily, and the waiters are amazing in their ability to rattle off every one of them with every ingredient and preparation along with it. I've never been let down by their food or their service. It's definitely more expensive than the Olive Gardens of the world, but it's totally worth it, and I can usually get 2-3 meals out of any pasta dish I'd order there. They also offer deals on Restaurant.com that you can use once a month and help you to savor their deliciosity without making your wallet too sad.  Some of the best things I've had here are their penne a la vodka (I'm a sucker for a good vodka sauce, and theirs is one of my favorites); a special that pops up every so often that's pappardelle pasta, filet mignon tips, and shiitake mushrooms in a marsala sauce; a caprese-type salad made with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese (frequently on the list of specials); and their eggplant parmesan. When they offer fish dishes, they're always very fresh (I haven't ordered one myself but my mom has gotten fish the couple of times she's come here with me, and of course I always snag at least one bite of everyone else's dish at the table... if you dine with me, prepare to share the love!). They have a good-sized wine list with both by-the-bottle and by-the-glass options. The bread you get in the beginning with olive oil & balsamic is so good I have to stop myself from eating too much & spoiling my dinner. I always leave here fat & happy."}
{"text":"Gaetano's is a real treasure.  It's tucked away in a strip mall in Henderson, an unlikely spot for a restaurant of this caliber.  The dining room is open, clean, well appointed and beautiful.  The staff is first rate, always mindful but never overbearing.    We started with the ravioli tasting plate, which everyone should get on their first trip to Gaetano's.  It included four large hand made raviolis - beet (really!), veal, pesto chicken and tomato.  They were all incredible and I will probably order a full plate of one of them on our next trip, but picking one will be very hard!  I was impressed by the beet ravioli in particular because of how unique it was.     I had the veal with risotto.  The quality of these two items always comes down to the skill of the cook. Anyone who has made risotto knows how time intensive and difficult it is to get right.  This was the best risotto I've ever had.  The rice was just cooked/firm enough and the sauce/cream was the perfect consistency.  The veal was perfect too.  I had spumoni for desert and it was delicious.  We will be sending out of town visitors here when they ask for a good, classy place to eat.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Groupon I had for this place was burning a hole in my pocket (er phone) so I decided to take my fella and mom here for dinner last night.   We came in around 7 and the place wasn't too packed. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated quickly. Almost immediately our drink orders were taken and a minute after that our server greeted us and welcomed us to the restaurant. He came back a few minutes later to give us a rundown on all the specials for the evening. The list was definitely extensive. Probably would benefit them to write them down since the waiter was forced to list about 15 different specials which a bit time consuming, but still informative.   I was debating between the pappardelle and the gnocchi, but I ended up going with the gnocchi. My fella ordered the chicken ravioli and my mom got the lasagna. The bread was really good and they were very generous with the quantities. We started with the artichoke heart appetizers, which was great. Our food took quite a bit of time to come out. We were left waiting for a really long time, but our server was extremely apologetic for the delay however. The food finally came out and everyone was extremely pleased with their meals.   Delicious, I'll definitely be back again since I know they offer restaurant. com deals."}
{"text":"Service - great, Adrian anticipated needs  and Alex was super knowledgable.    All plates were tasty. Alex accommodated a special request for me without hesitation.     Owner (Gaetano) was present fine tuning the dining room floor and made us feel comfortable with friendly conversation.   Bread was out of this world!!!!   This is someplace I would take tourist/family to so I could showcase awesome Italian cuisine in Vegas.    Alex just dropped the check and used our last names off our credit card...great last impression."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is the must overprice place in Henderson that I been to. Food is horrible and service is very poor. Everything on the menu is priced double of what I seen someplace else but a least some place else will taste better. You're a paying for the look of this place not for the food taste. Chicken parmesans was under cook that my wife vomited before we left the restaurant. I don't mind paying for good quality food but this is the worst for money I ever spend. I'll soon post the pictures of the horrible food we got for our money.  Well, I'll like to close by saying this is the experience of the six people in my party who will also never return to this place and I'm expressing my personal experience. Maybe, I just came on the wrong day. Fortunately, I'll only be taken as a fool once."}
