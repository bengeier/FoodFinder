{"text":"Great spot for homemade burgers with a twist. This place is for serious burger lovers tho. It's not for anyone that is into commercialized food or service. If you want to taste every fresh ingredients, flame broiled taste on the meats and the buns, then proceed directly to this joint.   Interesting thing is, I'm a picky burger eater and I had no complaints. The owner is friendly and engaging. The best part is his younger son that helps out; he's learning how to engage with the customer, very polite, and responsive.   A great family joint as well. Put simply; great value, clean, exceptional service, and tasty food. This is it!   My only regret was not showing up starving; because I wanted to eat EVERYTHING! If you are keeping score: Urbun Eats 1 - 0 me. Next time, when I visit Toronto again I'll be ready. Best wishes.   P.S. To the other reviewer with the dry burger; tell them and I'm sure they would have made you another one!"}
{"text":"Great little joint. Glad it popped up in an area that needed more good food choices. Owner was very nice and offered us a bit of extras to make our first stay welcome. Burgers were very good, no complaints but there are a lot to compete with in the city. Good sized burgers for a female appetite :)  Sweet potato fries were delish.   Space is comfortable with some nice rustic touch."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this spot if you're in the area, or looking for a great kitchen to order in from. I was really thrilled to happen upon Urbun Eats Co while on a long cold bike ride through the neighbourhood, and starving. The shop looked very welcoming, with a big screen TV and CP24 on, then the Leafs game. Staff were very personable and got to my order promptly, without the needy, stressed out air of desperation that can at times accompany an otherwise empty new restaurant, as I learned they had only been open for only 3 months. The 12oz burger came out quickly with a heaping pile of home cut fries. It was very very juicy, with a perfect combination of cheese, bacon and all the trimmings, and I enjoyed that they offered 3 different bun options. Will certainly be back to try out more from their menu."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and had lamb burger. It was fantastic. Also note the fries are so good, I ate them naked. The fries had that nice nutty flavour from just the right amount of peel left on the potato. My burger was so tasty with just the right amount of sauce so as not to dominate over the lamb flavour.  There were 3 of us at my table and absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat in the area. And with a burger, fries, and drink combo for $7.50, you can't really go wrong!  Not only is the food delicious:  Nice char on the burger, and for me the fries are amazing (I like mine on the softer side, and that's how they come here - although I'm sure they'd crisp them up for you if you ask), but the owner makes a real effort to make the experience a good one.   The staff is definitely a real strength at this place. Although it's clear that of the two staff, one is more of a cook, and the other is more for taking orders and serving, both seem to be able to help each other out in most areas.   I'll definitely be going back a lot. And I'm going to try my best to get through the entire menu in the coming months"}
{"text":"This burger place is good but not the best. But the reason why I give them 4 stars because they have very good customer service. First, I ordered an 8oz classic burger and a burger bourbon. They both taste good but if they could make the patty juicier by not making it well done that'd be perfect. I like the sauce and the caramelized fried onion on the burger bourbon. Also, the owner was so nice by letting us try his new dessert on the house. In term of service, I believe this is a family run business as I only see 2 people in there. Even though there isn't many people working there but the owner will make sure we have everything we needed and will check on us if the food is alright etc. I would like to come visit again if I'm around the area and try their other burgers on menu."}
{"text":"Hamburgers done right! It has been a long time since I had a satisfyingly well-made, well-seasoned, juicy though well-done hamburger.  Yesterday, I finally ate one that came up to my standards. It was a Mediterranean style ordered from their special features blackboard, with feta, olive hummus, yogurt-dill sauce, meltingly sweet grilled onions & pickled green tomatoes.  The toppings, and their brioche, complemented an already delicious meat patty. Members of my party who ordered cheeseburgers were equally satisfied.  It put us in mind of the glory days decades ago of Toby's Goodeats. We ordered fries to share.  The portion was generous.  If anything, the fries were even more delicious eaten cold and limp as leftovers several hours later than hot at the table . This restaurant deserves success, and I hope their food quality and friendly service never deteriorate."}
{"text":"I think it's a start of a new relationship here. I work on the same street as this mom and pop shop and was used to seeing the famous Wisey's Pie in the exact location where Urbun Eats is now. This is a relatively new business in the Leaside area, and I think it's got memorable qualities to make it a lasting gem. By that, I am specifically pointing to the service and quality of food.    Upon entering, you will be greeted with a smile  by a boy who seems to be the son of the family running the place. This kid's got emotional labour and customer service down, that's for sure!  I like to know my options and thus tend to be the type to ask several questions to pinpoint my food selection. Even so, he handled it all with ease without any hesitation and was a careful listener.  You could honestly tell that he cares for the customer and has a good work ethic when it comes to providing stellar customer service.   The food also has a magnitude of its own, mind you. I got the Urbun Smoke, which the boy recommended among other interesting items, with the Standard Combo. The Urbun Smoke was about 13 dollars and the Standard Combo, which included fries/onion rings and a pop, was 3 dollars.  Their burgers are priced at the gourmet tier, which may turn some potential diners away, but their quality of meats and portion size are their trump cards. Take a look at my burger - It. Is. Massive! I sent a photo to my friends and the size was all they kept talking about!   Their variety is also refreshing. When you order a burger, you choose one of three buns: regular, seeded, and brioche. The family members are also helpful in advising about the best bun selection for the particular burger you're ordering, so don't sweat it.  I think the brioche bun would put a sweet spin on a chicken burger, so I'm eager to try that combination next.  In fact, I might like it more than chicken and waffles! Meat-wise, my Urbun Smoke had Montreal smoked meat in it and it tasted far better than bacon in a burger! The AAA beef patty was also not overcooked. Rather, I think it was medium to medium well done because I still had some pink patches in my patty. This ensured that each mouthful was soft rather than chewy.  This is gourmet burgers done right.  Right now, it's a hole in the wall type of joint, but I wouldn't be surprised if it gets its own hype when the area becomes busier after the LRT is finished. It's got all the works going for it anyway:  1. Customer service with a Can Do attitude  2. Portions that don't leave you hanging when you run out of cash to buy seconds   3. Well-cooked and flavourful meats   4. A type of bun for any mood"}
{"text":"Came here because I won a $30 gift certificate from a social media contest and it did not disappoint! I came here with 5 friends so we got the chance to order many things off the menu. The manager was very kind and attentive from the moment we walked into the place. He showed us photos of everything on the menu and took our large order in a timely fashion.  We ordered the Urbun Italian, Urbun Smoke, and Urbun Classic.  I only got the chance to try the Urbun Italian which had arugula, balsamic glaze, buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto, tomatoes, and grilled onions. It was absolutely amazing and probably one of the only times I've finished an entire burger. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Finally, got a chance to check out this place. You can tell it is a family run business. The environment is very friendly and they have a good selection depending on what you are feeling. Didn't get to try the weekly special but they have burgers that are sweet to savoury. I tried the lamb burger or the URBAN FARM,  it was really refreshing with the garnishing and the mix of flavors they used. It wasn't greasy very filling I paired it with onion rings and a birthday cake milkshake. Would definitely visit again and try the other items on the menu. The classic was also great my partner had the 8oz fully loaded with the poutine. What's great about the classic is there is different size patties depending  on how hungry you are so URBANEATS CO really accommodates depending on what feeling.. they also had Fresh Prince playing in the background  so definitely  gave that homely feel."}
{"text":"Urbun Eats seems to be a family run business which is what I love. I was greeted by the owner who was very nice. It's a small Burger shop located on Eglinton & Laird.   You can choose from 4 different buns and 9 different burgers. There's also the option of Classic Toppings & Premium Toppings. Moving on they have a list of specialty options like Reuben & Fish Sandwiches. There's also Poutine, Giant Onion Rings and different Fries options.   I decided to go for a classic so I could really taste the meat, I obviously had to add cheddar cheese and I stuck with Classic Toppings like pickles, lettuce, onion, ketchup and mustard. What I really liked is that homemade taste, the meat had a good taste to it and it had a great char - just like a classic hamburger. The bun was very soft and all the toppings were great quality. I'm a huge Poutine lover so I had to give that a try, it was pretty good. The gravy tasted great and the cheese curds were squeaky.   The owner had just finished making his own special burger which was being released the next day, and asked if I wanted to split it... um obviously. He had created a Greek Inspired Burger which was not bad, I preferred the classic though.   I'd come back to try the Panko Crusted Chicken Sandwich & Onion Rings!   Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, onion rings, and bottled root beer!  Owners are extremely service oriented and helpful for first time patrons.  Will be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Add this to the long list of gourmet burger joints in the city. Can we possibly get enough?!?  Popped in for a late lunch. $7.50 special gets you a 4-oz burger with the usual fixings some fresh cut fries (really good) and a can o pop.   Burger was  juicy and combined with the condiments made for a bit of a mess. But otherwise was very good.   Not the biggest most filling lunch you can get around these parts but plenty good for the price. I was going to get lunch at the Harvey's at the nearby Home Depot and this was infinitely better for probably about the same price.   The gourmet offerings were in the $14 or $15 range but I imagine they are bigger and have more stuff.   Owner was super friendly and came out of the kitchen to chat. And if you're not the chatting type there's a big screen TV to catch up on the latest CP24 news."}
{"text":"This would maybe be a 5 star review if circumstances were better and soon I hope to update it! The burgers taste homemade and are tasty, however ordered delivery and the food arrived cold, burger was quite sloppily made with bacon that was not anywhere near crispy. Onion rings would be great if fresh, but they were coming cold and soggy. I will pay a visit to the actual restaurant, but won't do delivery again."}
{"text":"Came with our 4 and 6 year old kids. The owner and his family, who run the restaurant, treated us like gold and served up some delicious eats. The burgers are tasty and juicy, the fries are perfectly cooked, and the fish n' chips was a hit with my usually picky son. The secret menu ice cream burger is a must - but you have to ask for it, as it's not on the menu. If you're in the neighborhood or looking for a great burger destination, a stop here is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love family businesses. It always a personal feel to the service. And I had the delight of eating at Urbun Eats for lunch today. The family who runs the place are such lovely people. And the food was fantastic. Massive portions! And so delicious! I really enjoyed inhaling all 12oz of that burger. I am so happy that this place is so close to work and I can drop by for whenever the burger craving hits. I officially have my new go-to burger place. Cant wait to try the other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Great food, the owner offered us pizza fresh out of the oven to try and it was amazing The food was warm and fresh, must try the burgers here."}
