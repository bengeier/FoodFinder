{"text":"Great Pizza, Very Nice Staff, All Around A Very Good Exp.. If I did have to say something bad it would've been about the amount of toppings (A little sparse). Also the balsamic dressing for the salad, BEST ever. I'll be a long time supporter of this place!!"}
{"text":"It would be nice if Yelp and the business would update their information. Google mapped a pizza place nearby, went there to find it doesn't exist. Location is now 30 minutes away. Terrible way to move locations and not tell anyone."}
{"text":"We have lived  in Anthem the past 9 years so this is close to us. We order pepperoni but the slices are so thin and few in number there is no taste. Having moved from central Ohio suggest check out Massey's (the best) or Donato's to see how pepperoni is applied. Other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"My wife and her family are from New York City. This is by far the best pizza they've had since they've come out here to visit over the last decade. I'd have to agree. Well worth your time. Crust: Perfect. Size: Perfect. Ingredients: Perfect. Been ordering a pie weekly for quite awhile."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality and value here. I got a $5.95 lunch special, which included a pizza slice, soda, and a nice-size salad. The pizza had a thin, crispy crust and was something called a red, white, and green--mozzarella, tomatoes, and spinach. Only complaint is the place is really small so table space is limited."}
{"text":"We stopped by last nigt and picked up a 20in. Half chesse and half pepperoni pie and a cheese garlic bread blossom. It was our first time ordering food from this place not knowing anything about this pizzeria. I don't even know where to begin, it was simply a NY pizza pie!!! If your from NY like me, you know what I'm saying. I've lived the in az for long 4 yrs and really gave up on pizza. The dough is a perfect combination of crisp and chewy, folds in half perfectly. The chesse is made from whole milk mozzarella, the sauce is fresh and light! I was reading some past reviews people complaining the sauce needs more herbs, I guess if you're used to dominos pizza or this NYPD pizza which is a disgrace to ny pizza. Ny marinara is fresh, bright and light. I can't relate to the comments a out the crust, the crust is freakin amazing! The pizza here seriously takes me back home, THANK YOU RUSTIC PIZZA!! The chessey garlic bread was out of this world, I.can't say that I had anything like that in ny but I loved it. I was so taken back by this pizza, I called back to speak to the manager. I asked was it intentional that the pizza tastes exactly like a ny slice and Cindy said YES! The owners are from ny and had a lab  create the same water you would find in Yonkers,ny. It's funny because all these pizzerias claiming to have ny pizza and they dont, not even close! Rustic pizza doesn't even claim to have NY pizza and they do. For all my fellow New Yorkers, suffering here in the valley, go to Giant Rustic Pizza, you'll be glad you did. You will feel like you're back home!"}
{"text":"Wings were great. Salad was amazing. Staff needs to pay more attention to cooking time on the pizza. Didn't see it till we got home and had friends over that the entire bottom was burnt."}
{"text":"The most annoying thing in the world is having a $25 pizza delivered and the driver not bringing any parm and/or crushed peppers.  It happens every time I order from this location, even when I make the request while I order.

Weak. Even PJ's or Domino's will bring you peppers & parm by the handful. Yet I still come back to GRP because the pizza is sooo good. I'm a gluten for punishment I guess.."}
{"text":"Worst Mike  manager's customer service ever! I been placing orders for the last few months and today I found out my pizza price was $16.70 instead as $14.95 as stated on websites,  I called and I asked why it was a different price, she couldn't answer my question and said \" I will transfer you to my manager\", Mike couldn't answer the reason why just said, \"this is what the system said\", I explained I been getting the same price since I started ordering a few months ago, as well I also explained him that his  website stated it is $14.95 for the 14\", he said \"it might be the season or it is what it is\", what do you want? \" I expressed my concerns but he didn't care at all. He keep saying , it is what it is\", maybe our website is wrong..I feel terrible offended for a very rude manager, his customer service is awful! For a minimum and less then 2 dollars he treated me awful! And probably loose one of his repeatedly customers forever. .Awful service from the MANAGER MIKE!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, friendly staff and timely delivery. It's great to have a reliable place close by."}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer you could have said this location was closed on your webiste.

I used to love your business and would tell everyone about your Malibu Bbq chicken pizza, but today I am super disappointed by your business practice.  My husband decided to go online and order instead of calling in the order.  We received confirmation that it would be ready in  45 minutes before the pizza arrive, and I'm like that's normal, I'm good with the wait  because yum Giant Rustic Pizza, right? When it rolls over to an hour, I have my husband give the business a call just to make sure the delivery guy can find are apartment, but it turns out it's bad news: we are \"outside your delivery area\".  Um hello, if we were outside of your delivery area how about giving us a courtesy call, email or text notifying us of our situation! So we can work on  resolving the issue, like ordering pizza from another business in the delivery area/close by to pickup!  So instead your employees have chosen not to full fill the order and not to give us a call, and to have us call them when we are now a super hungry family and wanting  to know what's going on.  Well what's going on is that your service is not customer friendly! I am sorely disapointed. - really hangry customer"}
{"text":"I've been three times now. Great pizza with great pricing. We had the Thursday night special. Any 14\" specialty pizza and large rustic salad. The Malibu bbq pizza was fantastic. Not too sweet and just the right amount of toppings. The Italian Kitchen salad was full of meat and cheese, great olive tapenade with artichoke hearts and roasted peppers. All this food for $20. This will be our Thursday night standard!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza in AZ that I have had yet. The place is very Vegetarian friendly and everything from the food to the service had been the best that I have had in Phoenix. As I said I walked in last night looking for a new pizza place while moving to the area. Gina was friendly and accommodating beyond what I expect from any food service. I have never felt more welcomed to a restaurant ever. The best part is that not only was the service amazing but the food will keep me coming back alone it is the best I have had ever. I will be recommending this restaurant to everyone I know,"}
{"text":"Interesting place that I probably don't go to enough

This is not entry level pizza - actually has a wide range of ingrediants, types and the pizzas are GIANT.

But not quite high-end pizza such as an Oregano's or other top shelf pizza.. it is what is it.. a solid go-to neighborhood pizza place  - easy take-out, simple parking, no inside seating with a few tables out front (maybe for the lunch crowd)

If you are hungry and you don't want to travel far - go to this place - decent

i think they deliver and I have heard rumors that the sandwiches are awesome but i have not tried them"}
{"text":"By far the best authentic New York style pie I have found out here is the 20\" cheese. After coming here at least twice a month for the last year I have always found the 20\" to have the better consistency and style than the 14\" which seems a bit doughier.

Value can't be beat for the product. If you want a cheap garbage pizza go to Pizza Hut. This isn't that and yet the pricing is still as competitive as it gets, especially for a small local establishment.

While the artisan pizzas are a nice addition to have, you can't beat the basics.
Try the plain cheese pizza before you try anything else and you will know that this is a top quality product."}
{"text":"Went here last night and it was fantastic!! The quality of the ingredients really showed and the prices were very low. I had the Malibu bbq chicken pizza and I loved it. The service was quick and very friendly as well. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"HUGE pizza. Stopped by for the first time tonight. Will be back... in a week when I finish the left overs. 10/10."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite pizza place in the area.  Delivery is always pretty quick and delivered by the same friendly driver.

Pizzas are always fresh, delicious and not greasy at all.  I'm a big fan of their bread which goes great with their herb / garlic infused olive oil.

I can't think of any negatives about them.  We've ordered them quite a lot since they've opened and they haven't had a bad night yet.  Consistently good pizza is hard to find in this area."}
{"text":"Best delivery pizza that I have eaten!  The menu offers some different variations than the usual choices available. Last time the crust wasn't as good as the previous occasions and btw, skip the cheese cake. Otherwise would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"This review is a long time coming...Giant Rustic is just amazing! The food is spot on, the service is always impeccable, and the delivery is speedy, esp for such a fresh and delicious pizza. And I honestly don't usually like pizza, but I LOVE this place.  I absolutely love their 'Red, White! & Green' pizza and I like to add their juicy roasted chicken (there is a garlic base, so no tomato sauce...and I personally avoid the sliced tomatoes on it too bc of an allergy, but my bf loves it with them!) I also highly recommend their amazing artichoke dip and chicken wings. Mmmm...it's the best feast around! 

I rarely write a review, but Giant Rustic really went above and beyond and deserves great praise. I was sick and exhausted one sad Sunday, but I was so hungry, I picked myself up to get takeout from them. I wanted to try their crustless pizza, but asked to make sure no tomato sauce was used, bc of my allergy. When I got home, they unfortunately made a mistake and added tomato sauce. It was an honest mistake...but I was so ill, hungry, &  frustrated, I called them to complain, just so they would make note in my account of my allergy, for future orders. Well, I feel like when you typically call a restaurant and let them know they made a mistake on a takeout order, at best, the manager might say \"next time you're in, we'll make it up to you\" or try and get me to drive aaaaall the way back to get the order correct. Not Giant Rustic!  They were an absolute joy and gave superior customer service by, not only delivering the correct order within minutes to my door (which is pretty awesome bc this is when I was out of the delivery zone), but also giving me a free slice of delicious pie & a nice note that said \"Feel better :)\".  That personal touch really did it for me and I was so pleased that they went out of their way to make their sick & sad customer's day much better. They earned a patron for life with that....hell, I think I'm going to order tonight!

So I highly highly recommend this place! Not only are you going to get an amazing, mouthwatering meal, but you will also get service with a smile & a true appreciation for your business, which is sometimes hard to find nowadays. Thank you GRP!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for delivery!  Prices are very reasonable too especially for the quality of the food.  I now only order from this place for delivery pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is food poisoning in the making. When you order a slice employees never wash their hands nor do they use gloves, and that's all after taking your money and ringing up an order. If you order an artichoke dip expect it to be microwaved for couple minutes stirred with any tool available (finger, pens, thermometer) then microwaved again. I was surprised and disgusted with the level of sanitation in this place. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"the best pizza ever!!!
i am seriously addicted to their pizza!
wonderful service always with a delightful smile."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza but my experience with this location has been awful. They either take over an hour to get you a pizza or they don't deliver it at all. The first time I tried to order a pizza from here they ended up being closed because of a management issue and I never got my pizza (I never got charged) but I also had to wait an hour and a half before realizing it was never coming.

The second time I ordered we had to call about delivery and they had the address written down as Camelflower instead of Camelback. Took about 90 mins. 

The third time I tried to order a pizza it took 90 mins before it was delivered and that was only after I called to check in on it. They gave me a free pizza credited to my account as a result. 

Now, I'm sitting here waiting for yet another pizza that was quoted as being delivered in 45 mins.. It has been 90 minutes, again. We called to check in on the pizza (see a trend?) and they said they only had one driver. Now, I'm wondering if my pizza is going to be cold. 

Bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. The food is good but the experience is awful. Stop telling people you deliver if you really don't (I could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). If you're wondering why Domino's or Pizza Hut has been successful it is because they've mastered the art of pizza delivery. Either figure your system out, or give it up. 

If you're wondering if you should try this place then you should drive to the location and enjoy the food. Don't wait for your pizza to be delivered. You might starve."}
{"text":"The food is awesome!  We're staying at the Montelucia and wanted take out.  The ordering process is very friendly and organized.  To top it off the food is really good.  We had the 20' meat pizza and buffalo wings.  Will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Great little joint. Pizza was a bit late but understandable considering a small,friendly staff and the phone ringing off the hook.  I may try delivery because the charge and tip make it worthwhile to not leave my couch!!!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG.... The pizza was awesome! This is my new favorite place for takeout! I'm so happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"We received a free slice offer in the mail and decided to stop by for pizza and a salad. The space has a nice rustic feel with indoor and outdoor seating. There are plenty of menu options including salad, pizza and sandwiches and they also allow BYOB. The pizza and salad was great (under $3 for a slice with toppings) and this place is a great alternative to the other formal pizza parlors in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this Giant Rustic Pizza last weekend.  Overall, we enjoyed the pizza and salads and will definitely return.  My boys (3 1/2 year old twins) are sometimes picky eaters... but not with this pizza.  They absolutely loved it.  I didn't find it too oily, bland, or soggy, and the crust was pretty darn good.  I like putting crushed red pepper on mine, so that's probably why I didn't notice if the sauce needed anything.  As for the salads, there were very generous portions of meat on the Italian Kitchen and my California Dreamin was excellent.  The employees were all very friendly and personable... which is a good quality to have in a food service business.  Like many new restaurants, I'm sure the small kinks will be worked out over time."}
{"text":"This is the best neighborhood pizza place. I consider myself a pizza snob and generally only get gourmet pizzas, but this place rivals any fancy pizza restaurant. It was a couple different pizza places in the past, but I hope they don't ever move out of this space. Oh, and they have the friendliest staff and address you by name. Truly feels personalized."}
{"text":"I was a lil disappointed upon arriving to see that this place was so tiny (I was asked to meet someone for lunch) because I was told it \"was the best pizza in Az.\" However after ordering and devouring my half of our made to order pizza I must say its one of the best I've had and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The delivery guy was probably the nicest delivery guy I've ever met. The pizza was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place. Service is awesome and everyone is friendly. Well priced on their lunch special"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch.  \"CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS\".  Hoping this is true and it's only a temporary closure.  Their phone still works although it went straight to a recording.  Keeping my fingers crossed ...... love their pizza!"}
{"text":"************ Ask Them To Add 2 Herbs *************

      On my 1st visit ........ I found the Tomato Sauce ...... Bland for my taste.

      Last Night ...... by adding 2 herbs prior to baking...... the sauce was Terrific.

                    The \"Magic Two\" ............Basel and Oregano."}
{"text":"I'm pretty skeptical when i see the word \"artisan\" paired with pizza. As it usually turns out to be, this crust is soft and bready. In other words, there's no crisp to it. None of this is to say the flavor isn't good - indeed it's very tasty. Points to them for offering nice, fresh salads and uniquely topped pizzas. While they're too much for my simple taste in pizza, I think there's a market for it here. Give them a try to support the locals!"}
{"text":"As a precursor to our \"Veg-out and be lazy no cooking Thursday before a 3 day long weekend\", we finally headed to Giant Rustic to try their pies.

My rating is actually 2.5 as the extra half is really for friendly service however we were disappointed with the final product. It's hot and ready to go in 15 min as we chose to go order and pick it up. But as Georgie alluded, the sauce was lack luster and ruined the experience for me, bad sauce = bland pizza. Perhaps ordering some protein toppings or calamata olives would've brought a pop of flavor, but to get the basic cheese pizza on the wrong side of flavor town is a big deal breaker for me. 

Perhaps it's a grand opening type of case where we hope that the owners will in fact fine tune their recipe as also having delivery in our N. Sctsdl area is a marketing advantage for Giant to captivate given very extremely reasonable pricing. May try back in a couple months and hope for an improved experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Every time I visit they greet me by name and the food is delicious...the Belly Rewards are a huge plus also!"}
{"text":"New pizza place in Anthem. Heard mixed reviews. We decided to order for pick up since it's. Even pretty busy since it opened recently. Pizza was ready when we arrived transaction went smoothly. 

When we got it home is where my disappointment started. There was a hair on one of the slices-not human, looked more like a cat or dog hair like someone working in the kitchen had it on their clothing. Then I realized that the ricotta cheese I ordered to be on it was such a tiny amount at first I thought they forgot it. 

John- If you see this please use more ingredients. We will be back, but after some time.  The pizza tasted good, but would've been great if I had my ricotta."}
{"text":"Wow!  Delicious HUGE pizza, great salad, speedy delivery in the Biltmore-Arcadia area and decent prices.  I'm in heaven!"}
{"text":"Had a 14\" carry out pizza and it was pretty good . Crust was nice and crispy toppings were adequate and the Canadian bacon they use is amazing!! Only thing negative to say is if you like more than a hint of sauce, ask for extra."}
{"text":"Great pizza for the price!! The crust is really good with a great flavor. What really makes this place nice though is the friendly service. You definitely get the feeling that these small business owners care about their product. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the neighborhood.

My only gripe is that their menu on their website and on their online ordering system don't ever seem to match. Whether its pricing or products something is always out of sync."}
{"text":"Had the 14 in Big Berlescori. It was very good. I love it. It is pepperoni , sausage and Italian salami. Not sure why other reviews said their wasn't much flavor. It was seriously some of the best pizza I've had. Maybe they made changes to their pizza but right now it is spot on. 

I also really like the decor here. I'm from the country so the very rustic old barn wood they use to decorate looks really cool. Wish I could have a cabin or house like this. Very cool on the inside for being in a strip mall."}
{"text":"NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Closing Giant Rustic Pizza was an awful mistake . The pizza was perfection ."}
{"text":"Really good food. Wings, a sandwich, and a pizza were ordered for delivery,  it took over an hour, which is the reason the 5th star is missing. Had I been told, I would have picked it up."}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast I know pizza! I come here as often as I can as the pizza is just like being home. Amazing!!  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! My company made a huge order last week, the order came more than an hour late and delivered half the order. When we called to find out where the rest of the order was the lady on the line said she was quote\"doing us a favor\" .... Really I didn't know having us pay you fro product and service was doing a us a favor last time I checked you need customers to stay in business????? I would never go here again and the over 200 employees we have who are in close proximity to this place will also not be giving them any of our business again! WORST EVER!!"}
{"text":"I like this place!  We've tried the margarita pizza a couple of times and it has been excellent each time.  I've had the California Dreamin salad a couple of times as well, the salads are huge and the ingredients are incredibly fresh.  Last night we tried the red, white, and green pizza - it was a little too rich for me but I did enjoy the taste.  The crusts are light but doughy with a little bit of crunch on the bottom.  They have a great topping selection and some interesting menu items too.

Parking is a breeze because it's right next to Safeway but they deliver quickly for a few bucks if you don't feel like leaving the house."}
{"text":"Pretty big pizza that is crunchy and done right.  A slice from this place does remind me of a New York style pizza, but clearly the taste isn't NY at all (which is not a bad thing)

Every time I come in, staff is attentive and awesome.  They are very friendly and down to earth employees.  Even the guys in the back look like they just love their job, which to me is very important.  Their smiles and laughs put on a huge image on the quality of work they put into their service.  

They have a great selection of other food besides pizza such as Artisan type Cheese Garlic Bread, Salads, Wings, you name it.  As good as their other stuff is, their main focus is Pizza.

I'm not a food expert, I can only judge what my taste buds allow me to taste.  Everyone has a personal preference on what a good pizza is.  Obviously there is nothing here that will come close to NY or CHICAGO pizza, so people should stop trying to compare cultural tastes.

Giant Rustic Pizza is good because the dough is crisp.  Pizza is cooked to be well done without it being burnt, from the tip of the slice up to the crust,   If you order a slice or pie with toppings, they have just the right amount of items to put on.  Sauce and Cheese taste regular, I don't really understand how that can be made any better?  Every pizza shop in town uses cans of tomato sauce and pre-packed cheese (I know because I worked for them)

Overall, If you are looking for something with a gimmick and adventurous, this isn't the place.  If you are looking for a quick bite or just don't feel like cooking tonight, Giant Rustic Pizza makes that an easy decision.  Minor problem is that they don't deliver to my place (a 10 minute drive ) however, I don't mind coming to this place and enjoying a slice and a good conversation."}
{"text":"The pizza we had here was not good at all! Everything just fell off the crust and was way too greasy. Also we payed $30 something for 8 slices of pizza that were not only terrible, but it was super expensive and we waited forever! The staff did not seem to know what they were doing! Also the ambiance was very weird and not normal for a pizza place! Also no one in my family liked this place either.  Maybe I would go here if it was the last place on earth. Maybe. 0/10 recommend."}
{"text":"This is a must if you like East coast NYC style thin crust giant pizza slices. I ordered a plain cheese, plus a half n half hawaii (kids idea not mine) + Americano which is meat/veggies. First off I had no idea how truly huge a 20\" pizza really is. Two adults four kids two pizzas we easily fed everybody with tons left over. Sauce excellent, enough sauce too not skimpy like some places, plenty of cheese and the crust is done in some kind of brick / masonry oven because it had a very nice, very slight char some places which we like. We'll be back no doubt about it."}
{"text":"I actually love this place. The food is GREAT, and being from Chicago I am super picky about my pizza. That being said, I am giving them 2 stars because of their customer service this evening. We ordered from there a few days ago and drove to pick the order up (we live exactly 4.2 miles away-yes I mapped it). When my boyfriend was there he asked if they would deliver to our address (even though we were just slightly over their 4 mile delivery radius) and they said yes! Great news, especially for Sunday funday!
So we just called and placed an order for delivery, over $50 of food, and the girl on the phone said there was no way they could deliver. This is literally 2 days after we were told by the delivery guy AND girl working there that they would definitely deliver to our address 4.2 miles away.  Whoever answered refused to let me speak to a manager and her only response was that \"they are busy during the holidays\". 
I am beyond bummed and irritated at the lack customer service here.  We finally found a decent pizza place and I regret to say that we probably won't go back or recommend to any of our friends. I will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We decided to go for Giant Rustic Pizza shortly after it came to the Arcadia neighborhood on a night when cooking just wasn't going to happen. We found a deal for a three topping pizza and called our order in to pick up. The person who took our order was knowledgable and helpful. We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip on her suggestion. 

The spinach artichoke dip was nice, creamy and garlic-y and was served with thin slices of toasted French bread. Loved it.

Pick up was a breeze and we enjoyed our still-hot pizza when we got home. I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but I feel like tarragon and oregano MAKE a pizza. Let me tell you, they were on point with their herbs, y'all. Good crust, just enough sauce. The toppings are pretty standard pepperoni and sausage (the sausage is sliced instead of crumbled) but still good. I'm not sure id put it above all others, but it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"The staff are soo nice and welcoming! Can't say enough about how great this pizza joint is. One of my favorite places after a long day of work. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Don't go there we ordered a Pizza by phone came in 20 minutes like they said and the girl said it's burnt do you still want it (but you have to pay)now that is funny right! I said no we prefer our Pizza not burnt.  She said well we can make another so we waited............ and she finally brought it out and cheesy bread (total waste of money we forgot to look at it and it is so burnt. The Pizza was also burnt again smelled up the whole car. The worst part is they could have cared less."}
{"text":"Staff was. Was very friendly. The pizza was really good and they offer a gluten-free pizza. My wife said the gluten-free was actually really good. Better than borrows pizza. The pizza came out and took a little while but it was really good. Again the kids are great service and the establishment was clean. Price is fair no complaints. Keep up the good work Giant rustic pizza of Antnem"}
{"text":"This place has the right attitude as far as catering to the customer. It seems like every time I order from here and pick it up they go above and beyond to satisfy my needs to make the pizza just how I want it. I can only hope this place does well because you continue to always go to great measures."}
{"text":"I didnt want to be a contrarian, but I did not have a positive experience here, as others have. I ordered a giant pizza well done, and it was anything but. It was soft and mushy and disgusting. Worse still, I emailed them directly but never heard back!"}
{"text":"Wow I found a pretty good slice place down in Arcadia I was actually impressed really reasonable prices and really good pizza how can you go wrong some people may not like the burnt stuff on bottom but I think it's delicious we would like to play with the dough great texture and actually has some flavor and I did like the cheese as well perfect man of chew and stringiness the place is super small just a few tables but you gets the job done staff is friendly and explain things like specials and other things are going on definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I've ordered several times, and the pizza is good. But the service has become too unpredictable that I'll no longer be a customer.  They can't answer phones, take orders, or make deliveries in a timely fashion. It's great to have customer demand.  But too often, I come as a hungry customer and end frustrated by unmet expectations."}
{"text":"Craving some delish takeout? Go to Giant Rustic Pizza. Their ingredients are fresh, flavorful and gluten-free. They have a wide variety of topping options, appetizers, (wings, garlic bloom, etc.) and yummy specialty pizzas. Their crust is amazing, really soft and baked to perfection. You really owe it to yourself to stop by. I love this place."}
{"text":"Red, White, and Green pizza -- Yummy!!!  (I think it's the same one Morgan T recommended.)  I make trips across town just for that pizza."}
{"text":"Went back recently and it was HORRIBLE! Read on facebook that there are possibly issues with one of the partners doing a hostile takeover of the pizza shop. If that is true that might be why the quality went down almost overnight.  :("}
{"text":"Ordered 5 giant pizzas for basketball team to be delivered to a high school. Great customer service in the store...helped me download the app so I could get 10%off my order. The pizza was delivered on time and the team loved it. Would order again if on that side of town for sure!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Giant Rustic...and I do! They opened up shop in my local Safeway shopping center, an area where pizza places haven't done too well. They have some interesting flavor profiles on their menu, so I was looking forward to giving them a try. 

If you can't decide on just one style of pizza, they offer half-and-halfs at no charge. This was a great idea for me, because with a 20\" giant specialty pizza ($17.95), you won't get bored with the leftovers. I chose half Big Berlesconi (sliced sausage, pepperoni, and Genoa salami) and half Oahu Wave (Canadian ham, pineapple, and fresh cilantro). I was impressed with the quality of the meats...large thin slices, not greasy at all, and full of flavor. Both sides were delicious. The cilantro gave the Oahu Wave a unique twist, that complimented the pineapple's sweetness and the ham's smokiness. The Berlesconi half was simply phenomenal.

I also tried an Italian Market salad ($8.95) with Chipotle Ranch. Salads at pizza places tend to be afterthoughts. Not here. Fresh crisp romaine was topped with roasted red pepper strips, tomato, olive tapenade, artichoke hearts, thinly sliced red onion, and little bundles of salami, ham, and mozzarella cheese. I couldn't believe how good the salad was...the roasted peppers and artichoke hearts were spectacular, the tomato tasty, the olive tapenade zesty. There wasn't a weak component in this salad. The dressing was probably the best I've had, with the smokiness of chipotle rounding out that creamy ranch flavor.

A word about the sauce and crust. The crust is unique. It's not thin and it's not thick...it has a yeasty \"chew\" to it, but it's not doughy. You can fold a slice in half to accommodate eating, and it won't split. I think it's a perfect platform for their pizzas, and their use of the word \"artisan\" their crust is accurate. The sauce is nice and fresh, and not too thick. It's not overloaded with dried spices or canned tomato paste like other pizza joints' sauce, and I think some reviewers probably prefer that type of sauce. Rustic's sauce and crust compliments the pizza, and allows the flavor of premium toppings to come forward. If you prefer a saucier pizza, they will willingly add extra sauce prior to baking. 

The customer service is friendly, knowledgable, and accommodating. They know their products, right down to their desserts (though not made on premises, the Key Lime Pie at $3.95 was quite good). I really enjoyed their food and will be back, the only problem being what to try next. As I was inside waiting for my pizza, a fellow customer said I really needed to try their sandwiches...so who knows!"}
{"text":"Service sucks and so does the pizza. Came in and got a couple slices, waitress just props it down on the table and mutters \"here\" at me. 

I could care less if the people working here are rude if the pizza was good, but it wasn't. Looked good but the pizza had almost no taste other than the sauce which is weirdly sweet. 

Go around the corner and get barros, much better than rustic pizza."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place since it's so hot and I didn't feel like cooking. Kids ordered pizza, hubby ordered a sandwich and I ordered a salad. I had high hopes however service was terrible. It took 45 minutes to get the above and the pizza was burnt, sandwich bread was burnt and the salad was so blah and boring.
We won't be back. Too bad as I like to support local. It becomes worth it for me to drive 35 minutes into town for good food."}
{"text":"I haven't ordered delivery yet, but I've picked up slices for lunch and a giant pizza for dinner. So far I've been completely happy with my experiences at Giant Rustic! My favorites are the Red, White & Green and the Big Berlesconi...and you have to try the cheese blossom, trust me. If you feel like going out for a casual dining experience, they have a large inside seating area complete with TVs, beer and wine! Food is tasty, employees are friendly...and let's be honest, there's not a lot of options in Anthem so just give it a try!

Bonus: leftovers heat up perfectly in the toaster oven (can't speak for the microwave)"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. I like that they have baked wings that are crispy. Next time  to try the salads..."}
{"text":"If this place had a red roof got the hint in Scottsdale I could see that working .I say 3 may be 4 months gone no service and u clean .for what they charged pizza  and salad 26 . Glad I didn't have to leave a tip .better pizza and atmosphere elsewhere. Good hunting"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and you can't beat the lunch special (2 slices and a drink for $5). The slices are huge and FULL of flavor! I took home a menu so we can take advantage of the other specials and specialty pizza selections for a go-to dinner."}
{"text":"Horriblel service! When I went to the counter to order they told me they had cheese and pepperoni available by the slice. So I ordered two slices of pepperoni at 5:33 pm. Three customers that came in after me got their pizzas. I went to the counter at 6:00 pm and asked about my order. That's when the guy pulled a slice out of someone else's order, put it on a plate, then slid a second one into the oven and told me to wait. I wasn't about to wait longer after waiting a half hour! And with one old slice?!!!  I told them I wanted my money back and got it. They didn't even look me in the eye to apologize and no other conscessions were offered. If they were busy, they should have told me it would take longer. I went home with a frozen pizza from CVS. And won't visit them again!"}
{"text":"Last one sauce watered down. First time I went it was great! Get those kids that work there under control or replaced. They didn't answer the phone AGAIN so I ordered online, a pain towards a phone call. I got there and they said they were too busy to answer the phone, this was 10 minutes later and way after lunchtime. I went there early for a beer, too expensive so I sat and funny how NOONE was picking pizza up, phone wasn't ringing, kids \"working\" were loud and screwing off. It annoyed me. Pizza took 20 minutes longer than I was told. Wonder why? It's a shame, first one weeks ago was good. Can't beat Gio's in Anthem for the BEST Authentic Northeast Style Pizza and service is the best! Delicious ! Rustic, get better management and help, you won't last long the way you're going. Get kids or anyone that actually want to work!"}
{"text":"I'm a NYer who knows good pizza and gave up on finding a slice in AZ that reminds me of Johns Best on Bleeker Street. I recently needed a quick lunch and spontaneously stopped into Rustic Pizza for a slice. I can truly say that anyone who knows authentic pizza will love the large single slice, gooey cheese, crisp crust and great sauce, just like the best pizza in the Big Apple. The service was quick and friendly and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I need to go back and try other things besides the yummy pizza. Try it!"}
{"text":"Pizza is such a personal thing that reasonable people can disagree, but we were a bit underwhelmed by Giant Rustic.  I agree with a prior reviewer -- the crust is meh, and the sauce could use some punch. But the toppings are good and there are a couple of good varieties on tap, so if you like a thicker crust this is worth a try.  We did not partake of the salad, but the key lime pie was OK.

I also concur the staff there is very friendly and attentive -- no problems there -- and the price is good compared to some other local options."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, and nice salads to go."}
{"text":"I love this place! It might be the best pizza I have had in Phoenix, not counting the Chicago originals.  My husband isn't a big pizza person (crazy right) but he even loves this pizza.  We are simple just cheese & pepp for us but they do it so well here.  The girls that work here are amazing also. You can tell they love ppl & there jobs....so sweet and pleasant. Not to mention I totally screwed up my online order and they were unable to contact me before u arrived to pick up.  They totally guessed what I wanted because what I entered online didn't make sense lol. They were right and had the correct order ready when I arrived. 

Only con: A little overpriced for pizza so we don't get it often but if u want good pizza it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Tried Giant Rustic pizza when they first opened and had a terrible experience. Decided to give it another try and it was just as bad. The pizza was so greasy and the crust was like cardboard. 

The  only staff I saw were a bunch of teens and they stood around just talking in the back most of the time."}
{"text":"Okay, how about if your \"closed\" you let someone know your closed???

Leave a message on the voicemail, post something on your website, let Yelp know, smoke signals, anything....otherwise someone will drive expecting a decent slice of pizza and low and behold- denied!!!

Also one of my pet peeves is when a restaurant is going to close, why don't you, as a restaurant owner, say your closing?  Telling everyone your \"closed for  renovations\" while literally the place is cleared out accomplishes what?

It's obvious the place is closed, thus the posting on the door, and there isn't one item left of the original place.  Hopefully another great pizza place will be moving in.....only one can hope"}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't that great. The tomato sauce was very watery and the crust was just too crackery for such a big hefty pie. It wasn't the worst pizza by any means, but it won't have me coming back again in the future. The giant pie averages about $22 with a few toppings, but besides for the box being bigger, it just felt like I was eating a slightly larger slice. Also, there was a musty smell upon entry and earlier in the day there was a little kid in the kitchen. 

The pizza is certainly giant as it had to be stored in my backseat. The front counter was a bit hectic as it was staffed by under trained teenagers, who did not know prices or specials. They should clearly have an adult up front since the place just opened. They recently closed on two recent Sunday's because they could not handle the crowds and the staff \"needed a day off\". already after a month open. The search for good NY pizza continues."}
{"text":"Big pizza, some might call it giant. I just got that to slice lunch special though. They were really big, and definitely filled me up.  I did not get much \"rustic\", but it was a good solid American style pizza. My friend got  the Mediterranean salad, and was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Didn't seem very rustic and just \"OK\".  Not worth chasing down for the first time or visiting again."}
{"text":"I called at 11:50am to make a pick up order. I know it's lunch and busy but they told me to hold I did and no one picked back up and I waited for 8 minutes. That's a long time to be on hold to place a pick up order. Made me mad as heck! Gotta work on your front end employees! Super slow I guess and I'll take my money else where."}
{"text":"Nice clean place to grab a slice of pizza. Very well priced very large slices. I have been to this place several times and the staff is always friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Called at 4:30pm on a Sunday and literally spent over 20 minutes on hold without getting to speak to a person. Called a second time 15 minutes later and waited another 10 minutes on hold.. I have had the pizza there once before and it's good, but not good enough to be on hold for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for good pizza. It's not gourmet but is certainly leaps and bounds above a Domino's or Pizza Hut. They are consistent in both the quality of food and delivery time. We are now loyal customers to this little strip mall gem!

Hint: We like to ask for a little extra cook time on the crust. It makes a big difference!"}

{"text":"I am from NY on vacation here in AZ. Stopped at GRP for  pizza, garlic nuts, citrus BBQ wings and Caesar chicken salad. Everything was delicious.  Service was really good. 
Will definitely return on my next vacation to AZ"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Saturday night at 8:15, only 4 people working the entire joint (kitchen included), no manager, and all staff are minors. Took forever to get our wine (and in pretty sure it was illegal for the young lady to pour it), and 30 minutes for or slices of pizza (after 3 excuses) when it finally did show up, the crusts were all burnt, and the only utensils are plastic (basically useless).  Pass on this place. They have had enough time to get their act together."}
{"text":"So, I really like their pizza. Always had good luck, never any issues. That changed today. 

Ordered 2 regular sized, not giant, pizzas for carryout. Went and picked up a sweaty kid from football practice, then picked up the pies. Everything seemed fine. 

Got home, sweaty kid, tired kid, grumpy wife, and myself started to eat. Everything seemed fine. Got about halfway through dinner, and my wife freaks out. She says there's a hair in her food. I promptly blame her for the rouge hair. Problem is, this hair is long, brown, straight hair, and my wife has short, black, curly hair.

The hair is super thick, so they must use high quality hair products. Its baked into the cheese and/or crust, which allows you to pick up the leftovers by said hair. 

I called to see if someone had a reward for the missing hair, but I was placed on hold before I could say anything. Sat there, on hold with the hair/crust on the counter for a few minutes. Decided I didn't feel like waiting for someone else's problem, so I wrote the review. 

So, I really dug this place, but now I'll just go to Barro's."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very busy last night (8-31-17) and we waited waaay tooo long for our food! Pizza arrived about an hour or more after we ordered and was burnt (to my liking). We ordered the Cheese Blossom appetizer, which ended up being the only AND most decent part of the meal. Hubby didn't want to eat his calzone either.

On a positive note, the young lady at the front counter was very personable and seemed to be handling the 'tired of waiting' customers (both dine-in and take-out) in a courteous manner.

This was a sad experience especially since we were giving them a second chance from an earlier visit gone amiss. The pizza is good but, unfortunately, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty happy with Giant Rustic Pizza. There aren't too many NY style pizza joints in the Arcadia area, at least not too many good ones in my opinion. I usually will travel to N. Scottsdale to Ray's if I'm craving pizza like home. That being said I thought Giant Rustic Pizza was pretty good, not quite the same as NY but good enough for me to return. My husband and I wanted a cheat meal and both checked out the menu. I wanted to try the Red White & Green which is a white pizza and my husband really wanted a more traditional style with sauce. I asked if they could do half & half and they said \"yes.\" We both got what we wanted, which is awesome. We also ordered the Italian salad which was somewhat like an antipasto with lettuce, the portion size was very generous. Both types of pizza were very flavorful, the white pizza had some nice ricotta on it and the red pizza had great sauce. I can't comment too much on the ambiance as we got our order to-go, but the staff was very nice and our order was fast. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"5 star pizza: the spinach ricotta pizza will be the void you need to fill in your life. Get a slice for lunch during a hard work day or an entire pizza after a bad date. Just kidding. 

No I'm not. It's Netflix and Chill worthy. 

If you're not in the mood for pizzas, their subs are amazing! Very authentic and truly Italian Rustic. One of the best vegetarian sandwiches I've ever had was the Tuscan sandy. Perfectly crunchy and smooth even after trekking it to-go. 

5 star lunch service:  The girls at the front that are typically there are SUPER sweet. If you've been in Arcadia for a while, these girls are the face of Arcadia. They've worked at many of the local best joints and I can say hands down these girls make for such wonderful customer service. 

EDIT: Previously I gave them a low review on carry-out/delivery but upon new ownership, we have not had any problems and have been treated with outstanding and excellent service. I'm very impressed with how fantastic and well trained the staff is. It's very impressive for a new owner to come in and make a place that's already great even better!"}
{"text":"First things first, the pizza was good; nothing special - just good.
I did some research on the menu before our first visit; I decided to go with the Wednesday special which was a 14\" pizza specialty or three toppings with a specific appetizer or two salads ( house or Caesar).  When ordering, the young gal was polite; but, not well informed with the specials. I knew more about It than she did. 
Additionally, when I have pizza, I like to have a draft beer with it; this place has no tap beer - bottles only. I ordered a Kilt Lifter - $3.50!
If you don't like paper plates and plastic ware for eating out - then don't bother with this place. No silverware or real plates...
The gal brought our salads - we both orders the Caesar; the Caesar had lemon and tomatoes - no croutons and no shredded cheese. I asked the gal if this was a Caesar, she said it was and explained the difference between this and the house salad. She said they quit adding croutons because customers didn't like them; she did offer to bring some out and did. I threw some ground Parmesan on it with the croutons and called it good.
While waiting for the pizza, we were the only customers in the place; the three teenager girls working - were having WAY TOO MUCH FUN - screwing around in the kitchen. One of them threw something and if flew into the dining area; I'm not really sure what it was.
Pizza came out - looked good - not greasy; but it had no real flavor that made it unique. It was just - good. If I have this again, it'll be carry out only - not sure I'll even go back. ?"}
{"text":"The pizza is HUGE and the crunchy crust is fabulous, they are always friendly and your order is always quick and ready to go!"}
{"text":"For the price, it's great pizza! We just ate here for the first time tonight and had the wings and a pepperoni pizza. Both were very good. It's a small location with minimal seating so your better off getting the pizza to go. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow!! Very impressed!! A 20\" pizza for 12.95?? First of all, as a pizza snob, the crust is great, the toppings, quality, AND the value amazing! I love that they have pizza by the slice AND really good salads, too!! I will keep coming back--this pizza place is worth trying!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is killer and so are all the people who work there! Everyone is friendly and really care about their pizza eaters!"}
{"text":"The sauce and cheese have less flavor than the box.  The crust was puffy and lacked a good chewy texture.  It was pillowy, which is bad crust in my book.  At least it's priced fairly, the staff is pleasant and it has a good location for the neighborhood.  They also sell pieces by the slice.  Nevertheless, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tried this pizza place for delivery for the first time. It took an hour to get our pizza due to that Sundays are their busiest evenings. When we received the pizza it was completely cold. They did warn us of the delivery time, but that doesn't mean we should get cold pizza. I will say, at least the pizza wasn't greasy. I will not order from here ever again. I was going to call and complain,  but I decided to write this review."}
{"text":"This.Pizza.Is.GIANT!!! I don't think I've ever seen a pizza as big as this one, for real. My man and I were deciding where to go for pizza after a hike... 'cause you know, you gotta treat yo' self... he suggested Domino's (umm, no), and I said Giant Rustic Pizza. I won, lol. 

My man was complaining that it wouldn't be enough pizza for the cost, but boy did I (and Giant Rustic Pizza, of course) prove him wrong. I couldn't decide on which pizza I wanted -- Queen Margarita (Tomatoes, Splash of Olive Oil, Fresh Basil, Fresh Garlic, Mozzarella) or Red, White & Green (Olive Oil & Garlic Base, Seasoned Ricotta, Spinach, Tomatoes & Mozzarella) -- so the extremely pleasant lady working at the counter suggested to get one pizza and do half and half. Oh glorious day! So that's exactly what I did. Fast forward about 15 minutes later when I walked out with a GIANT pizza box that was about as big as me! Lol. My boyfriend's eyes got wide and he said he would trust me with food choices moving forward -- he wasn't aware that you should never question a Yelper. hehe. Now he knows. 

The pizza... wow. The slices are big, with bubbling hot cheese topped with fresh ingredients, and baked to perfection with a crispy crust. (My mouth is watering as I write this review, lol). The Queen Margarita side of our pizza was perfect; simple yet perfect and extremely tasty. The Red, White & Green side was just as delicious, although it left me with garlic breath for the rest of the afternoon, haha. 

I love that the pizza was so GIANT; it made for yummy leftovers the next day. I'm a fan of Giant Rustic Pizza -- great pizza, fresh ingredients, exceptional service, all for an extremely reasonable price. (Side note: the prices on the website are not accurate... the pizza is about $1 more than what is listed on their online menu.)"}
{"text":"This place makes some tasty pizza and has great prices. I had the lunch special, so two slices of pepperoni and a drink. Well worth the $5. 

Their large cheese pizza starts at $8.95 which is a fantastic deal. 

My only suggestion to the company would be to save their to go pizza boxes for to go orders. It's probably cheaper and I feel bad wasting a box when I'm going to eat those pizzas up in like 2 minutes flat."}
{"text":"Gave this place 2 try's. Very average, too thick of pizza for me... I prefer thinner such as NYPD, Bianco, not sure the hype on here. Also had the wings which I actually preferred over the pizza. Quick service if you call it in, therefore 1 star for service."}
{"text":"The Zucchini pizza is amazing!!!  Giant Rustic pizza is the best pizza I have ever had. The ingredients are fresh and the delivery is quick."}
{"text":"You can't beat their lunch specials and stay in Arcadia. Your choice - either 2 giant slices + soda for $4.95; or, 1 giant slice and a side salad + a soda for $5.95.

I just wish they would fix their website and online ordering so I don't have to call in to order one of their other fantastic daily specials. And, that font. Oh, my eyes.

I've never had a problem with customer service - except that one time, a couple years ago, when they had a \"management issue\" shortly after opening and closed for a random day or two. Forgive and forget, I say. I'm glad they worked it out and are still slangin' pies down the street from my place...time to order dinner!"}
{"text":"The Camelback area is quickly becoming a destination for a pizza lovers. If are one you, can add Giant Rustic Pizza to the list. The Slaughter House and Big Berlesconi are a must for meat lovers.  We also recommend the Italian Kitchen and California Dreamin'(no meat) salads."}
{"text":"All I can say is Wow.
We order their pizza all the time for work meetings and not one of our 50 technicians have anything bad to say about the Pizza. It is always great, always cooked to perfection and the people are great!

Try this place and you will thank this post!"}
{"text":"1) Prices are too high for what you get.
2) They serve the wings plain with sauce on the side. Might be a pro for some; a con for us.
3) Water is disgusting! They serve it through the tea brewer... augh.
4) No beer on tap; bottled beer was warm.
5) Pizza was meh. Better than Dominos, I guess.
6) Cashier seemed confused about basic questions, like \"Where do we get plates?\"
7) Paper plates. Seriously?
8) My plastic fork melted on the first cut. 
9) Busing own tables is fine when the prices are lower, and then there was the issue that tables weren't being wiped down between patrons.

If we ever eat there again, it would be as a take-out, but Barro's and Gios would have to go out of business before that would happen."}
{"text":"We order the 20\" cheese pizza for $14.11 last night for dinner and thought it was very good.

Giant Rustic Pizza is located in the Safeway shopping area, next to after school learning center Kumon and Leslie Pool supplies.  This is a take-out only store that has seating outside.  Besides selling whole and half pies, Giant Rustic sells by the slice, along with salads and artisan breads.  The latter is mainly for the lunch crowd, but it seems to have attracted some of the parents waiting for their kids at Kumon.

The pizza is a very large twenty inch pie that is tasty.  The smaller 14\" pies are called Large.  Although it is a thin crust, the bread is very chewy.  Our family of three thought is was a little too chewy, but that is a matter of taste. The dough they use seems above average, while the pizza sauce was not seasoned very much.  The light dusting of cheese on top was just enough to cover the pie.

Compared to the other pizza places within a few miles of this location, Giant Rustic's is closer to NYPD, than Ray's or Corleone's in terms of style.  NYPD tends to be chewier of the three.

We liked the pizza and all the energy and extras the new owners bring.  The prices seem in line -- somewhat less than Ray's and NYPD; but more than Corleone's for a similar sized pizzas. As I've mentioned, the 20\" Giant Rustic Pizza is $12.95, while the 14\" Large Rustic Pizza is $8.95. Additional toppings are $1.75 each for the Giant and $2.50 each for the Large. All prices are before AZ sales tax.

Giant Rustic also serves sandwiches that are made with their Artisan bread for $7.95.  They include Chipotle Turkey Slaw, BMT, Tuscan Veggie and Italian Bird (Turkey).

In the case next to the counter, they sell Giant Salads for $8.95, with names like Sonoran Chicken, Mediterranean, Italian Kitchen, California Dreamin and The All American. They all looked good, so I'll be back at some point for lunch.  So Three Stars, \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in anthem if you have not tried it you must it is very delicious the pizza the wings and the gelato are amazing . Lauren was very nice and very helpful I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza if you want to wait 1 hour & 50 mins for pizza after being told 1 hour. If I hadn't called not sure we would have received our pizza before 2 hours. Unacceptable!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for date night on Sunday, cute little place, pretty good pizza, but no garlic knots that night which was a serious bummer, then we were going to do a deal which was like a pizza and some wings but it didn't say on their site the deal offer ends at 4 or something, and I swear they forgot our order and had to ask us about it like 2 separate times."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. Friendly staff and fast service. This is definitely a go-to when grabbing a bite near the office."}
{"text":"Great pizza for big crowds and parties! Very tasty pizza and feeds the masses! Great dinner spot for families with kids!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered a pizza, waited 20 min to get it. paid for the pizza, waited another 10 min. At that point someone asked how they could help me and I said I just paid for a pizza and am waiting for it. They then proceed to tell me they still haven't even put it in the oven. At this point I had to leave (lunch break) and they offered to give the pizza to me free if I waited. Since I couldn't wait, I left in disappointment on how this was handled and called the manager. I proceeded to get laughed at and lied to by the manager and he could care less. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Good pizza place for the area! The whole pizzas are really good, but the pizza slices can leave something to be desired, since the toppings aren't cooked on they aren't as good.  Can also seem a bit pricey compared to others."}
{"text":"Giant rustic rip-off...Sorry! I hate leaving negative reviews but wasn't impressed. At. All. Cute little place with rustic decor but the food was less than impressive. Think of the pizza place in the airport where you order a $10 salad that's not even made fresh to order. Thats a deal breaker for me.

I ordered the Italian salad which was decent but NOT worth $10. Pizza was ok. More on the dry side with cispy crunchy crust. Not bad but again WAY over priced. $41 for 2 salads and a cheese pizza 

If you aren't picky about pre-made salads you might enjoying trying one."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times.  
It's better than most take out pies.  It's strictly a take out place but they do have some outdoor tables that work out well, at least when the weather's nice
 
It's not \"artisan\" or anything especially fancy but it's better than most.

I like the rustic decor and the simple menu.

Why the low rating?  Based on my first visit, I had mentally given them 4 stars.  

The last time I went, I wondered why the bill was so high.  I added up the prices from their website and knew what to expect.  The bill was several dollars more.  
The teenager at the cash register explained that the owner decided to raise the prices but chose not to update the website.
  
Not cool.  

He said \"Yes, we have had a lot of complaints about that\"  But of course, the new price is the price they are charging and if I didn't like it, I didn't have to take dinner home to all of the people sitting at home waiting for me to bring pizza. (-1 star)

That was a week ago.

Today, we ordered a large pizza.  (Their \"facebook\" special)  
We expected their large pizza.  
We got a small one. 
Why?  Here, \"large\" is small and \"giant\" is \"large\"  
Got it?   
Don't order large and expect their big one; it's their small.
(-1 more)

The pizza is pretty good and deserves about 3 or 3.5 stars, but I really don't like feeling short changed, especially not twice in a row."}
{"text":"Big pizza little flavor. If ur into a lotta food u got it here...big fresh looking mouth watering pizza...takre the ist bite....wheres the flavor?.....second bite...hmmmmm...3rd convincing bite.....yep..no flavor....salads are really good tho...maybe big rustic salad?"}
{"text":"We love Giant Rustic pizza. The pizza and salads are great. If you join the rewards club you get some pretty major discounts.
However, the best thing about this place is the staff.  For example, my daughter spilled an entire lemonade on the floor. AnnaRose, one of the servers, cleaned up the entire mess without batting an eye. She was so helpful and professional, when I am certain she had better things to do!
We love the pizzas and salads but the staff make this place great!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time Saturday, and I must say they live up to their name! For $22 you can get a giant pie with up to 5 toppings and the best part is the toppings are fresh and the wait was only 20 minutes. I am defiantly coming back here regularly."}
{"text":"Always looking for a good pizza place... THIS IS NOT IT!! Got there and there were three people in front of us but still have to wait quite some time. Finally got to the front and was getting the Brooklyn Best but there were green peppers. Asked to substitute basil as I did not want peppers. Was charged $2 for the substitute. To their defense they said I would be charged. To their discredit when the pizza showed up there was MAYBE a pinch of basil. The crust was WAY over cooked, dry, and tasteless. There were huge bubbles that were burnt. The sauce was no better. The sausage was tasty but VERY GREASY. Needless to say - will not go back as this was the worst pizza EVER!!! Bad service, Bad food, WAY over priced!!"}
{"text":"I ordered two pizzas and garlic knots for takeout when they first opened about 4 months ago. To be honest, the food was good but not great. It was way way too doughy and lacked significant flavor. It was not cheap ($45 for my order) and I just wasn't blown away. The place was immaculate and the owner/manager was very nice and accommodating but it just wasn't what I expected.  Maybe that's because I am full Italian and I know a great pie when I try one. I had heard so many great things about them too. I would say try it but don't expect anything out of this world."}
{"text":"A new pizza place by work, yay! 
I was very excited to try out this place for lunch, and I thought the food was very yummy.

Even though its called giant rustic PIZZA, they offer salads and sandwhiches as well.

Their specialties pizzas are a bit higher pricing than I was expecting, but the lunch specials are a good price."}
{"text":"First time in. Got the veggie sandwich. Yummmmm!!! The bread is fresh and delicious.  The girl at the front was very friendly.  I'll try it again :)"}
{"text":"Update: Went back last night and tried the pizza (chicken pesto).  It was phenomenal.  Same incredibly friendly service.  I will be going back regularly (and looking forward to trying the rest of the menu).  

I had the turkey slaw sandwich.  Giant portions, absolutely delicious.  Really cool decor inside.  Friendliest staff you could imagine.  Looking forward to trying the pizza."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where all of the 5 star reviews are coming from.  I have ordered several pizzas from here, but the pizzas come out different every time.  Sometimes they are tasty, with enough sauce and the crust is just right.  But most of the time they are just meh.  The last time we ordered, we received tasteless sauce and not enough. We decided to complain because it's happened more than once.  Oh boy, the sfaff was friendly up until that point.  They do not accept criticism very well and when we requested another pizza with more sauce, we were treated as if we were asking for a free pizza.  That is our last time visiting this place.  Oh and by the way, we paid the driver for the replacement pizza just to make a point."}
{"text":"No flavor!!!  This pizza joint is from the prior owners of NYPD pizza who sold and started this new place.  While its a decent price point there is no taste to it. Crust is mediocre and the sauce is just awful. It's like they opened a can of tomato sauce and dumped it on the dough. Meh!"}
{"text":"Happy to have a new pizza option in my neighborhood!  The pizza is tasty and the cheese is REALLY good.  We also had bread with olive oil.  The fresh baked bread is so yummy with the garlic olive oil.  Also, and this is important to me, the service is great!  They just opened and you can tell they really want to make this a neighborhood place.  The second time we called in an order that asked if we wanted the pepperoni and mushroom again.  I think that's a nice touch."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Gluten Free options are awesome. Pizza and Garlic Knots are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"For Anthem location.  Went in the other day, really excited to try it out.  It was so bad that we asked for all of our money back and happily walked away from our whole pizza.  Here's the rundown of all of the things that went wrong:

1. We stood at the counter for almost a full minute, right in front of the manager, with no acknowledgement.  She and the kitchen manager were talking about the schedule right at the cash register.  While I understand that this is an important part of the business, there was a customer right in front of both of them, clearly waiting for help.

2.  Another employee spotted us from the back and rushed up to the second register.  She kindly helped us, but when I asked two very basic questions, she didn't know the answers.  \"How much to add a topping to a pizza?\" and \"What is the cheese blossom?\"  The cheese blossom is one of only two appetizers on the menu.  She didn't know how to describe the item.  The manager (still right next to her at the other register), looked up and dismissed it rudely with \"She's new.\"  So why is she on the register if she can't answer basic questions?  To me, the manager belittled her employee and showed the poor management in the inability to set the employees up for success. 

Also, while we interacted with the young girl at the register, the manager and kitchen manager wanted to nudge and giggle together.  While there wasn't anything necessarily inappropriate, it just wasn't professional, and was very distracting to the customer and the employee helping us.

3.  Chive TV is on all three televisions.  Only.  It's the only station set to play.  While it may be a cool station for most of their clientele, it was not appropriate for families with children.  While sitting there, a segment title \"Drunk Fails\" was playing.  It showed inebriated people chugging bottles of vodka, throwing up, jumping off of brick walls, flashing the camera (though blurred appropriately).  This segment lasted for over five minutes before I got up and said something. She told me that was the only thing that they played on t.v.  At this point, only the amazing pizza that we awaited could save this very poor experience.  

4.  The pizza arrived, with oil floating heavily on the top.  There was sauce with no flavor, and lackluster crust.  It was seriously disappointing.  So disappointing that we were happy to walk away from it and pursue lunch elsewhere.

The manager did kindly give our money back and apologized for the t.v.  I appreciated the professionalism at the end, but it wasn't enough to make up for the poor taste in our mouths.  She told us \"I hope you'll be back.\"  I'm sorry to say that we won't.  Gio's and Barros will get our pizza business in Anthem."}
{"text":"Great pizza, chewy crust and nice sauce. Yes, they have slices. Really friendly service."}
{"text":"Cute ambiance/theme...very reasonable prices and specials....Could this possibly be the new Mamma Mia...hmmm I don't think anyone can top Mamma Mia, but it does come kinda close. The ingredients that MM used still reminds me of what NY pizza tasted like. I'll definitely come back to try the spinach dip and wings also."}
{"text":"Accidentally stumbled upon this place while stopping at Fresh & Easy next door.

Best pizza in Arizona, easily.  I have lots of family on the east coast and I always complain about how you can't get pizza that tasty here in AZ -- but Giant Rustic Pizza is as close as you can get.  It's delicious, I won't order pizza from anywhere else now.  Pricing is also great for how much pizza you get.  Atmosphere is good, and the employees are all great as well."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by how good this pizza is. Great selection of toppings, reasonable prices and the people who work here are very nice. 
They even deliver for not as crazy a minimum or fee as most other places around. This is a good spot in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love, love, love East Coast style pizza!!!  HUGE slices and awesome sauce.
The location in the Safeway center has seen many Pizza places come and go quick.
I really hope they have the staying power so get the word out and go give it a try.

FYI I went to the Scottsdale location in the Safeway shopping center on FLR Blvd"}
{"text":"The great thing about the Phoenix pizza scene is that we are big enough to have pizza options for almost every occasion.  Where does Giant Rustic Pizza fit?  It is the ideal spot for some cheap NY style lunch slices or to take the kids for dinner on a weeknight.  It's not Pomo or even Spinatos but you will be hard pressed to find a better pizza lunch deal for under $6."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing ... I've had every pizza in Anthem and surrounding area . Don't go off some of the other reviews . I ordered Americana and the red,white and green ..omg it's so good and the price is even better , I'll be back for sure. Yum yum"}
{"text":"I want to give 3.5 stars but ya just can't. I tried this place based on the reviews and the photo of daily deals that they offer... which turned out to be old. I was hoping to get a large 14\" for $11 but the new deal for Tuesdays is two larges for $20. (They only have two sizes so large is technically their smallest pizza.) Anyway, $17 later, we got a 3-topping \"large\" pizza. Nothing else. I was gonna get wings but... 

     The pizza was pretty darn good. Not amazing, just good. About 3.5 stars good. Would I go there again? Only if there was a deal going on. $11 sounded perfect. Moving on.

     The service was friendly and the place is clean.  My wife was really happy with it as well so that makes my life better. Unfortunately I will most likely not be going here, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't. It wasn't bad, it's just not for me. And I don't live around here either, so there's that."}
{"text":"Ok, I am not a regular connoisseur of pizza -mainly because when I hang out with other folks it is the typical default.  Thus goes this tradition ever since I left the Bay Area (it was a different game altogether then and so I am NOT crazy about crazy gourmet pizzas anymore). When left to my own devices, I avoid it.  I am almost positive that after ordering the pepperoni and sausage pizza yesterday, I will become a fullfledged addict complete with weekly group meetings and confessions, and relaspses.  The crust -usually my least favorite part -and I always leave evidence behind, was exquisite.  There is something about the gluten percentage that is worth mentioning.  It was sooo good in fact, that I may just order a regular cheese pizza the next time and I NEVER go that route.  And then there's the cheese....Oh, did I mention the warm welcome I received??  Ok, back to the pizza.  Wow..  Four stars only because I am a cynic.  Nobody gets 5 stars from a person who owns 150 cookbooks the first time out.  I will revisit the restaurant as well as the 5th star. 

P.S.  Almost too small to dine in and that is just fine with me."}
{"text":"Very good, thinner pizza but puffy crust, neat place to eat in at as well....every time I have gone it's tasted great!"}
{"text":"If you love good pizza and face it who doesn't...then Giant Rustic Pizza is probably for you. 

I have eaten in here and today I got my order to go. 

They are fast, it never takes long, my take out today was ready in less then 15 minutes for pick up. The ingredients always taste like they are fresh you can tell allot of this stuff isn't coming out of a pre-frozen bag like the commercial places and if it is they are taking good care of it with proper storage techniques.  

Today I got the Sunday/Monday Special a large 3 topping pie and a dozen wings for just over $20. I think out the door with taxes it was like $24. As my gf put it...we smashed it!!! LOL!  The pizza was good, we ordered a pepperoni sausage and extra cheese pie.  It didn't seem like they went very hefty on the extra cheese I ordered but regardless the pizza was still pretty good. The wings were really good, not sure why they put the sauce on the side, I would of preferred the wings were tossed with the sauce...and they could of been cooked maybe another 1 or 2 minutes in my opinion. They were done...but think they could maybe used another minute to get a little more done.  But we still smashed them so no complaints. LOL.

We have been there before thou...when you go inside to eat you can get pizza by the slice if you choose, and its not like Little Caesars were its been sitting under a heat lamp, it's fresh and you can put your choice of toppings on it. I will say this about that though...if you go nuts on toppings you might as well get a pie. Toppings can be kind of pricey, but typically you can 2 pepperoni slices for around $5. 

As far as the ambiance goes..its cool...seems like it could use a bit brightening up... the place is a little small, I definitely wouldn't go there for a large birthday party, but considering there is a Baskin Robbins next door...it could be a fun little date.  

Would of given this place 5 stars if they had a tiny bar and were open a little later. 

I have never done delivery from this place so I can not speak to that, but I would like it more if this place were open later...a good late night pizza joint is hard to come by...especially one that delivers. I think they should stay open till at least midnight on Friday and Saturday instead of 10pm. In general I think they should be open later...but that's me."}
{"text":"They changed their menu AND raised the prices without updating their menu online OR in person. The cashiers were not knowledgeable. When I came to pick up my pizza, they made the smaller one when I ordered a large. They fixed it but I had to wait another 30 mins and they still charged me the same. I won't not recommend this place as it was a very frustrating experience. Would've been better off ordering from a predictable place like papa johns."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here one day for lunch since I work in the area. Great lunch special and great food! Walked right up and placed my order and a few minutes later had my two slices and my drink. Cute little place with good food, friendly service and great prices! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic. Great flavor, an amazing variety to choose from and the staff went above and beyond to work with us for a very large party with mostly small children. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I don't know why there are negative reviews. The crust is almost as good as Pino's, ingredients are fresh and the service is fine. And they make a 20\" pie, forget about it."}
{"text":"So we tried ordering from these guys on Memorial Day. I went online and didn't see anything posted about whether or not they were taking the holiday off. When I called, I got put on the answering machine loop explaining that they were taking other calls but did you know that Rustic pizza bla-bla-bla. Anyway after 5mins on hold I decided just to drive over there as I live close by and indeed they were closed for the holiday. Now they could have changed the machine message or posted something on their site, but hey I get lazy too sometime, and actually doing that takes a bit of time and everyone is entitled to a holiday. I was more disappointed than peeved, as my wife and I had drooled over the menu and had taken the time to decide what we would order before we actually tried calling. Plus I was a tad Hangry so there was that too.
For what it's worth,  the Fresh N easy next door is open 24/7 so I went in there and grabbed 2 DiGiornno  frozen pizzas for 12 bucks and after 20min in the oven were FANTASTIC!! Frozen za has come a long way! So if you are ever at Rustic and they are closed, grab some DiGiorno! It's tastes like delivery! It really does!
Last night, we decided to try Rustic pizza again and so we ordered a half pepperoni/sausage add mushrooms and half Green and White. We also added a bakers dozen of their baked chicken wings. The order came promptly, and we were pleasantly surprised that it was a woman driver. Our first one ever!
The food from Giant Rustic Pizza was AWESOME! The pizza was HUGE and the topping were bountiful and tasty. The crust was thin and bubbly and crispy, the cheese rich, the sauce delicate and delightful! The chicken wings were also really good and baked to perfection! (Just got hungry writing this and am currently munching on a cold tasty slice!)
I'm glad to have found this gem of a pizzaria nearby and we will certainly order from them again soon!
Giant Rustic Pizza was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Omg!  The italian bird is my most favorite sandwich in all of Phoenix!  They do a great job here and just love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza and I think the owner is totally cool.  I just wish he had a location closer to me so I could get my Giant Rustic fix more often.  

The pizza is GIANT if you order their biggest pie and I recommend you try it!  If you like pepperoni, it is some of the best I have ever had, loaded with flavor.  Not to say all the ingredients here are not wonderful, the pepperoni just shines.  Every topping I have tried here has been fresh and awesome though.

This isn't a fancy \"Wood Fired\" or \"Coal Fired\" pie, but it doesn't need to be.  Cooked to perfection every time and delicious!

SW corner of 40th St. & Camelback - Check them out now!"}
{"text":"We pick up a large pie & garlic knots almost every Friday.  The pizza is usually good, sometimes the crust is burnt, a shame since that's my favorite part.  I ordered the knots in the photo on Oct 20th, clearly they were beyond burnt and we tossed them.  I called the shop that night, the gal said we'd get a credit card refund.  That didn't happen.  So, I emailed the business, no reply.  My husband asked about the credit when he picked up our last order, still NOTHING.

So, we gave them a chance to correct it offline & now I must knot-shame to get a $6.95 credit."}
{"text":"ER MER GURRD.. ordered a big berliskoni and garlic knots.. greatest thing to enter my mouth (besides you babe). Jokes aside Fantastic pizza, excellent service, and remarkable experience. Staff was friendly and suggestive. A woman by the name Maddy and a young gentleman Brandon helped to make such an ideal time for the family and I. Recommending!"}
{"text":"1st time to try out lunch at giant rustic pizza. I had 2 slices (queen margarita and Brooklyn hero). There were baked fresh upon order. I especially love the queen margarita. Wow!! Full of flavors! 

Went for dinner tonight. Ordered 14\" 1/2 queen Margarita and 1/2 Hawaiian. Only disappointment was my pizza was baked by a young girl. The queen margarita was only cheese, tomato and little touch of garlic. Tasted blend. Yesterday lunch pizza was baked by the owner's son and the slice of queen margarita I ordered had  lot's of basil, garlic, tomato and feta cheese..it tasted dynamite. I will make sure I call in next time to make sure I get the right person to bake my pizza."}
{"text":"Great place for big NY-style pizza slices. 2 slices and a can of soda for $5 is a steal."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings were A-OK. I was expecting a better more flavorful pizza but it turned out ok. I had the Brooklyn Hero, the Margarita and the wigs. Not bad of a place.

I wish their pizza had more of a oomphf! to the them. But they tasted like normal NON-chained pizza which is always a good thing. Wings were pretty nice too. The dipping sauce was good.

Give it a try.. maybe it will work out for you."}
{"text":"This place is very close to my office, and I frequent it for lunch. Their pizza and salads are top-notch, that is really all I have tried so far. Mainly because I like it so much I have ventured out. The other menu items look delicious as well. However, what really stands out about this place to me is the people that work there. Every person I have dealt with at the front counter has the nicest personality. You can see a similarity in the employees, it seems like management hires a certain type of friendly service oriented person on purpose. Even the cooks are super friendly and take the time to say hello and joke with me. It is very apparent that they care about their customers and it shows in their service and food."}
{"text":"The first time I stopped in was New Years Eve picked up a menu around 2:00 PM and was told that they would be open later i th evening. I called in around 5:15 PM and was told they were closed for New Years Eve. I was shocked, the person I talked to was very very sorry for the inconvenience this caused me and promised me a free pizza. I thought like this guy is not going to remember me. Well to my surprise Scott the owner did remember me and he pulled out the piece of paper that he wrote my name on New Years Eve about the Free Pizza. I was really impressed or should I say shocked that this man did this. So today I went in and ordered the Pesto Chicken pizza and OMG it was awesome. The crust is nice, not to thin not to thick and the chicken pieces were small chunks, not shredded or bland tasting. I will be back to try Queen Margherita Pizza.  I will support Rustic Pizza because the staff is awesome and the Scott the owner is priceless.  Happy New Year to all. - Jodi O"}
{"text":"The new Rustic Pizza in Anthem was good. I am Italian and from the east coast so with that said I am still trying to find a great pizza place. We went 8:00pm at night to avoid the crowd and having to wait so long for food. The place was clean and the staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"I have gone back a few times hoping to like their pizza but it is bland and lacks any distinct taste. They need to add more seasoning to their sauce and their dough."}
{"text":"For lunch, my coworkers and I enjoy trying out different places around us (the few that there are), so I was hoping for the best at Giant Rustic Pizza, since it's right across the street. The ambiance was very casual, which is always nice.  It is warm and inviting atmosphere with enough TVs around to catch a glimpse of what's happening, but not so many that all you see are TVs. The prices are very fair for the product served and the lunch specials cover all bases. The only reason I am giving a 4-star review today is because I personally like a thicker pizza. The crust was baked perfectly, the cheese was perfectly melted and everything tasted fresh, there just wasn't much substance in each bite.  I will consider coming back, especially if invited by coworkers, or my family wants to go, but I might choose something else if eating alone."}
{"text":"Very fast and fresh pizza , ingridients tast good!  I will recoment and comeback . First time here after a great foot massage next door."}
{"text":"Giant Rustic Pizza is just one of a handful of pizza options in my 'hood... It's not my favorite, but it's moderately priced, and as the name implies, well portioned!  It's conveniently located on the corner of 40th St and Camelback.

I've gotten full pizzas to-go on several occasions, tried their salads once, and most recently, ordered just a slice to-go... The slice is a nice option - especially if you or your kids spontaneously want pizza but you don't want to order a whole pie.  You can pop in anytime to get one - no need to order ahead.

The pizzas are fine -- nothing super special.  I wouldn't recommend the salads, but this place is a nice affordable option for decent pizza on short notice -- especially for those with large appetites.  That being said, just go for the pizza -- keep it simple.  Keep your expectations in line with 3 stars and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly solid place for pizza up in Anthem. I found the crust to be delicious and not too thick or thin. But be warned: the giant pizzas are indeed GIANT. 1 slice from our giant Red, White, and Green pizza was plenty for me (well, that and a piece of the garlic blossom which is so soft, cheesy, and to-die-for). The only thing that kept it from 5 stars in my eyes is the price, which felt a tad expensive for the product especially in Anthem. I'll be back to try a few different pizzas to see how the rest of the menu fares up - but Giant Rustic was the perfect take-out option for a casual dinner at home."}
{"text":"I like their giant cheese pizza the best. I have tried some of their fancier ones which are ok, just nothing amazing.  Salads are only ok- The salad dressing tastes bottled. I still want to try their calzones and garlic knots."}
{"text":"I think this location is closed. The phone never picks up and can't order online. Sucks."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after I received a mailer. I ordered a Malibu BBQ chicken pizza over the phone and it was ready for pick up in 15 minutes. A giant pizza, which is 20 inches, only costs $20 and I thought that was a really good deal. The pizza comes as a thin crust and the crust itself had good flavor but the crust was a little too limp for me. I wouldn't say soggy but I should have ordered it extra crispy. When I toasted it at home in the oven, it was significantly better. As for the toppings, the chicken was average. It is fired roasted but I couldn't taste anything special about it. The BBQ sauce was not tangy or very BBQ saucy. The sauce seemed very mild and can use some additional ingredients for a wow factor. I would come back here again, but I would make additional requests for my pizza to get it the help it needed."}
{"text":"Have been here for 45 min!!!! Still no pizza! They should have not charged me and been a little nicer about how busy they are."}
{"text":"The Pizza is very fresh its good the salad was freshly made but the dressing was a little strong for caesar.  I would not rush to go back but would stop by if I was in a rush or in the neighborhood and need to take something home for dinner."}
{"text":"We are from Texas, and are new to Phoenix! We were out exploring and happen to find this friendly neighborhood pizza joint! We were the lucky ones! Shaun the owner was super friendly and very welcoming!!! So now on to the food.... We ordered the typical pepperoni black olive pizza..... But this pizza is NOT typical! The pizza is delicioso!!!!!! The wings are baked and awesome, and the garlic cheese blossom aka... Cheese bread rocked!!! 
Come support this place it was amazing family dining!"}
{"text":"I am overal OK with this Pizza. The biggest down I am seeing is their consistent quallity in delivery. Overall its decent and good value for the money. Issues I had are like, one pie was over crisped, another pie must have hit the side of the oven coming out so it wasnt round any more, it had a flat side to it, and one pie was almost perfect. 

Tip: Call in your order to a real person. Its very confusing to use their online ordering because you have to provide the order in Halfs... meaning you do each side seperately. Its quite annoying. They use a third party provider to do the online ordering so its their dumb system,. not GRP's. 

Also this is TAKE OUT Only for all practical purposes. The dining area has a few high tops and thats it."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, a coworker said they had good lunch specials, so why not. I ordered the two slices and a drink for 4.95. You can also get a salad and a slice of pizza for a few cents more and that comes with a drink as well. I ordered pepperoni, it was very hot and fresh, the pizza crust was great and crispy.My slices were large, could barely finish it. I'm going back today and going to get a salad this time. Perfect little lunch spot."}
{"text":"I ordered a Margherita style pizza which had too much garlic and a crust which was just OK.  I also ordered Buffalo style hot wings and when I got home I discovered that they forgot to sauce the wings.  I may give them another shot but with so many other choices it's hard to imagine that I'll actually get around to it."}
{"text":"Glad we finally tried Giant Rustic Arcadia! Very good pizza: sauce was good, amount of toppings great, quality of ingredients fantastic, customer service very good...and they deliver! Will definitely be back! If you're  looking for high quality delivery, not the big box chains, I'd highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had to drive from Scottsdale because the Giant Rustic near us closed. Worth the drive for their salads and slices. My kids and I love the Italian Kitchen Salad! Had to ask for the bread which is the best part as it no longer comes with the salad. While I'm sad the one in Scottsdale closed I'm glad this one is open. One of the best places in town for salad."}
{"text":"Kids loved the cheese pizza. We built our own with carmelized onions, green bell peppers, italian sausage, kalamata olives--it was solid. All fresh. The owners are the same group that founded NYPD until it was sold to owners who stopped going fresh. New York style stuff here at Giant Rustic. They go so far as to match their filtered water with what they had back in Yonkers. That's commitment. Great scene here off Camelback, too. They deliver. Solid place. I prefer it now over all the others that deliver to us.

Again, kids like it. Thank the Lord.

You can also get a slice inside which is key."}
{"text":"Very clean customer service friendly and prices were reasonable the pizza was above average and the chicken wings had a different twist on"}
{"text":"I am an extremely picky pizza person. I just am.  

I try 5,6,7 places every time I move somewhere in search of great pizza that I want to consistently order. 

This place, though a little pricy, hits the spot.  There pizza is the perfect flavor, crust is amazing, and I will continue to order from here. 

I have had 3 positive experiences in a row.  Keep being you GRP!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best chicken wings and pizza in Arcadia area for affordable price. Convenient from where I live and employees are friendly every time I go."}
{"text":"This place is owned by a friend of a friend so I want to see them succeed and I hope this is taken as constructive criticism.  That said, I'm torn.  I's a great price for a giant pizza but it lacks flavor and they only deliver to the other side of a postage stamp.  

The Good:  Huge pizza for a decent price... 

The Bad:  I want to love it but it lacks flavor.  I think the sauce could use more olive oil, garlic, basil and a pinch of salt to bring it out.  The crust is a wonderful texture but again, not much flavor.  The pie could benefit from a little pecorino or parmesan in the cheese mix too.  

The Ugly:  if you want it delivered, you better live across the street because that's the boundary!  We live less than two miles and we're told we are outside of their delivery area... Hmmmmmm.  

I hope they'll tweak a few things so I can love this place and give it five stars!"}
{"text":"Giant Rustic Pizza is our go to pizza place.  So much better than the local chains.  Service is great.  Prices are very reasonable.  The delivery driver remembers us and is extremely friendly.  The pizza is DELISH!  The 20\" giant pizza is huge!  Our favorites are the Santa Fe Sunset, the Malibu BBQ Chicken, and the Brooklyn Hero.  The pizza is so good, we have never gotten around to trying anything else.  Hope this place is around for a long time!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good and tastes much more authentic than most pizza places.  The wings come without sauce and the sauce is in the side which is a bit weird.  It seems difficult to get all of the sauces and the correct amount of sauces especially for a large wing order.  Online ordering would be really nice too.  I think if those were fixed it would be 5 star."}
{"text":"$5 for lunch, drink included?! I'll take it! Seriously this is such a great deal for a substantial amount of food. The slices are enormous, and pretty good too! Crispy crust, not too greasy, and a good cheese to tomato sauce ratio. I am so glad this spot is here for when I want some cheap, no-nonsense pizza. 

The restaurant itself is very clean, with a table or two outside and lots of tables inside. The deli case had some pretty good looking antipasto salads, too."}
{"text":"First great service and great food! Always greeted with smiles we are such regulars they know the order and start it right away, The wings are soooo good BAKED not fried,I could just make a meal of them. Pizza of course is some of the best I've had, subs are also tasty. again the service is fun plus these employees stay busy when not helping customers, cleaning ,stocking and keeping it moving which is rare now and days. Kudos for their hard work. will always be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza. Huge pies with great prices!  We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"OMG delicious!!  Looking to try somewhere new in Anthem and so happy we did!  Had the Malibu chicken pizza, wings and garlic knots. Everything was very good and very fresh!  Service was fantastic. Very friendly staff. Atmosphere is rustic and inviting. To top it off they also have ChiveTV. Highly highly recommend this place!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We usually pickup the giant cheese and garlic knots, both of which are great! We've never eaten in the restaurant, but it looks clean and cozy. The location on 40th St and Camelback is convenient and I love the large slices."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in town! They live up to their name of \"Giant\"!!! Man! One slice is bigger than my face! You gotta try it! 

The place is small, but God Damn do they have good pizza!! Go try it now!"}
{"text":"This is my lazy/hungover Sunday dinner.  This pizza is amazing. I highly recommend the margarita queen. If you are eating alone a large will be plenty. You will have far too much pizza for one person if you get the giant. Pretty fairly priced but they do charge extra for sauces."}
{"text":"Love the pizza-the thin crust.  They don't have meatballs...wish they did for the pizza..but if that's the worst I got - I'm good with that.  Great crust and the sauce is spectacular."}
{"text":"I ordered a 14 inch and 20 inch pizza and 20 wings.The pizza only had a few toppings for the enormous 20 inch pizza. A little too pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"The WORST service ever! I had heard that the service was poor but decided that give it a try anyway. I took my husband and kids and ordered a large pizza. We sat down and waited OVER an hour just to get a 20 inch pizza!!! Don't eat there!"}
{"text":"I'm a Jersey girl and I know good pizza. This is a great pizza shop!  That Italian Bird sandwich is the bomb! It's the bread that really makes it. I'm so happy that North Scottsdale has a real pizza place with delicious pizza and sandwiches. This is the real deal pizza place!"}
{"text":"Pizza crust and meat were good.  very little cheese and sauce so I suggest asking for \"extra\"...I suggest you show your employees your website to show them what the food is supposed to look like

Salad was good

Two plus hour delivery......well that sucked

Just okay....at best.  Anthem NEEDS a good delivery and food place but this place isn't it...hope the lease take over payments were small otherwise this will be another empty commercial location"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this opening up near work. Who doesn't need another gourmet pizza joint nearby? While it was good, it wasn't amazing. A few co-works and myself walked over and after much hemming and hawing, we each order the lunch special. You can get a slice of pizza, a side salad, and a drink for $4.99. Or you can get two slices of pizza and a drink for $4.99. I opted for the special pizza of the day (vegetarian - black olives, green peppers, and onion) with a side salad (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and I picked cilantro lime dressing). Others tried the cheese and pepperoni pizza. 

Back in the office, we chowed down. I didn't much care for the salad dressing - way to overpowering. The pizza was pretty good. The crust was fine - not my favorite. The slices were huge though. Bonus points for that. My co-workers liked their cheese and pepperoni and agreed the slices were huge. Again, nothing special. I think we all agreed we'd definitely give it another try but maybe order one of their specialty pizzas to split."}
{"text":"Tried for first time 2 weeks ago and then went back the next week.  We luv the lunch special.  The pizza sauce flavor is great. They have fun pizza of the day options."}
{"text":"Placed my order went and picked it up it's 15 min. From my home, Pizza was cold gave me the wrong wings  no ranch One pack of parmesan sprinkle cheese for a 20\" pizza when I called and talk to the manager TJ he offered me 10% off my next order, really!"}
{"text":"There is nothing better during Sunday Night Football than a pizza.  Because of that, Giant Rustic Pizza has become our go-to for Sunday nights.

This NY style pizza parlor has yet to serve us a mediocre pie.  Our personal favorite is the red, white and green (tomato, ricotta cheese, and spinach) and we add sausage.  It is seriously A-MAZE-ING!!  Anytime anyone says anything about pizza, we always come back to this standard.  

Also, they make their salads fresh if you'd like some greens, and also do a Sunday night wings special, which I highly recommend for all you fans out there ;)

Hooray for Giant Rustic Pizza Sundays!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  We've had pizza, wings, salads, calzones and sandwiches.  Service is extraordinary ... Fast, friendly, knowledgeable.  This is our go-to place, at least 3-4 times a week.  Definite pride is shown in the employees for what they produce.  Now if some of the customers would learn their manners, especially letting their kids crawl on tables, run around the tables, etc.  These kids are going to hurt someone or themselves.  Please, folks!"}
{"text":"I've ordered close to 100 pizza's from this company.  They are not cheap, and their pizza's are usually great.

I've now been on 2 phones simultaneously for 68 minutes and nobody is answering.

It is Memorial Day, but their website doesn't say that they are not open.

I'll look for a place that can service the customer.

Their hold music/message doesn't say they are closed at either location.

Screw me once, shame on me, screw me twice shame on you.

9/12/15 Edit

This is the 3rd time that I've ordered from their 40th St & Camelback location without ever receiving a call or a pizza.  The woman said between 45 and 60 minutes when I ordered.  After 2 hours I ordered from another location.

Amazing how bad this company is run.  Remember, at this point I've ordered around 300 pizza's from them.  My advice is to pass them by.  Domino's is better as they show up."}
{"text":"Nice stop for lunch. There are a few tables outside. We enjoyed the large BBQ chicken pizza for $15.95. Crust tasted great. You could also get pizza by the slice for lunch"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and a nice place. Too bad they didn't have enough help out front but they did their best and with a little patience all went well. We love the thin crust!"}
{"text":"We have eaten pizza from Giant Rustic on 6 occasions. We love the Red, White and Green sub Sun-Dried Tomatoes. That being said, tonight's experience warrants a 1 star rating. We were first turned-on to Giant Rustic by friends. We loved it enough to order it the next week at our own home. Everything was great. The next time we tried them, we waited forever for our pizza when we picked it up in the store. They gave us free dessert for our troubles. The owner (?) was very apologetic. Nice save. The next time we ordered was for delivery. They went to the wrong house. We had ordered for friends who were  in from out of town and had rented a vacation home. Though we specified the different address, they went to our home (we suspect) and not to the rental where our friends were staying. The food was delayed. You can see by the above experiences, though the product is good, the service at Giant Rustic has not been consistent. Then we discuss tonight's debacle. We called to order for delivery. We specified delivery and we specified the address. The person at the other end of the phone told us our pizza would be 45 minutes. At an hour and six minutes after we placed our order, we called Giant Rustic. We spoke to the person who had TAKEN OUR ORDER and she told us that our food had been marked for pick-up and had been waiting for us. We asked them to re-make the food so that it would be fresh and told them that we would come up to get the order. We asked how much time would be needed for the new pizza to be ready. The woman who took our order, Suzanne, clarified our order (again) and said it would be 15 minutes. The location of the store is 40th and Camelback. We live at 36th st, just south of Thomas. I left three minutes after my phone call and drove to Giant Rustic. Oddly enough, our pizza was ready. There is no way it took me 12 minutes to get there. Yet, here they were presenting boxes of pizza to me. There were also no pizzas in the oven baking. Hmm...I asked if these pizzas were the re-makes and I was assured that yes, they were. Upon inspection of \"our\" order, I pointed out that the Red, White and Green was supposed to have sun-dried Tomatoes. At this point, the customer service lady looked at the ticket and said, \"Well, they didn't even take the order right. Oh wait, this isn't even your order.\"So, two boxes get whisked away and another two are placed in front of me. Again, NOTHING came from the oven. The two pizzas that were presented were indeed correct. I asked the second customer service person, \"Are these the re-makes?\" He assures me that, yes. They are. The bottom of the pizza boxes were warm, not hot. But what can I do? Two people have told me these are my pizzas, re-made. I am charged full price for my pizzas, not offered an apology (I did get one on the phone prior to the other shake-up), and sent on my way. Once I got home, I bit into luke-warm pizza with a chewy crust. This pizza was purchased so that my in-laws, who are recent Arizona transplants, could try the deliciousness that is Giant Rustic Pizza. EPIC, EPIC fail. I am so disappointed. Bad listening, incompetence and lies. All in one encounter tonight at Giant Rustic Pizza. I think we are on a break with this establishment for awhile.  I hope this place figures out where the break in the chain is. The food is great. Service, not so much."}
{"text":"First time we've tried this place. We called the order in and it was an hour wait. We ordered a large slaughterhouse pizza. There wasn't enough sauce and the meat pieces were small. The flavor was good, just needed more sauce.  We also ordered a caprese sandwich. It was ok. The mozzarella was bland even though there were large slices, and it needed more balsamic vinegar. The bread was very hard and flat. My husband ordered the chipotle bbq wings. He said they were really good. I'm sure we will try it again and keep all of this in mind next time."}

4 stars for my first visit to Giant Rustic Pizza!  Prior to my call for takeout, I called to ask a few questions regarding allergy issues I have with corn- does GRP use corn meal in the production of the crusts?  How about in the oven?  (Some restaurants don't use corn meal to help add crunch to their crusts, but a LOT of places use it to keep the bottoms of the pizzas from sticking to the oven floor, and this sadly keeps me from enjoying past favorites and from trying new places that are on everyone's list of bookmarks.  I'm happy to report that GRP does not use corn meal at all.  The person on the phone was very helpful in answering my questions, and for those that he couldn't answer himself, he offered to ask those in the kitchen who could.  After we hung up, I continued to look over GRP's webpage and decided I'd order the 14\" Big Sky (cheese with five toppings) for $15 plus tax.  I normally forgo red-sauced pizzas, but something told me to try one of each, so I went for two orders of Big Sky- a white pizza with ricotta, spinach, artichokes, seasoned feta, and garlic, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/giant-rustic-pizza-scottsdale?select=VP28FVb81R7KblTMVv_nDw#VP28FVb81R7KblTMVv_nDw and a red pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, spinach, and artichokes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/giant-rustic-pizza-scottsdale?select=9QDrj92eJNOydcrH78tYCQ#9QDrj92eJNOydcrH78tYCQ  I vaguely remember saying something like \"Oh, but these photos online of the crusts don't look like thin-crusts to me,\" to which the GRP rep said, \"but we can do thin-crusts, if you'd like.\"  Oh, yes I do!
The phone rep was calm and did not seem to be in any rush and answered all of my questions.  This surprised me, since I thought the more people they could rush orders through on the phone, the more pizzas they could be baking and selling.  I suppose I'm just like many people who are used to rude service on the phone.  Thank you, GRP for being different!  :)

When I walked in to retrieve my pizzas, the two people at the cash registers were very welcoming and had big smiles for me.  Greeting customers with smiles sounds so simple, and yet this single act alone can make the receiver of the smile feel like a $100!  The staff at GRP also make it a point to open the pizza boxes to show you what your pizzas look like, and to see if they meet your approval.  These looked and smelled AMAZING, and when I got home, I found that they also tasted divine!  A little too heavy on the ricotta, but I will never complain about too much ricotta, since I can always take some off, but too little is something to whine about...  Each pizza had their merits, and I wholeheartedly recommend ordering pizzas with red sauce from here.  I am a die-hard white pizza fan, so when I tell you the red sauce is good here, you better believe it!  During my first ten years of life in Manila, I ate SO many sweet Filipino-style spaghetti, and while they were delicious enough for me, I do not favor sweet pasta sauce anymore.  GRP's is very tasty, tangy, and zesty.  I also enjoyed the white pizza-- I recommend adding the feta for a little kick, since the ricotta can be a little sweet."}
{"text":"Really good food, excellent service. The knots were fresh and hot. The wings were perhaps the best I have had. The pizza was good, the crust was good, thick crust. They have coke products that's a home run. The marinara sauce was excellent. The price was great. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great Pizza at great prices, makes delivery for work a great local option. Just need to keep stocked on their cheesecake :)"}
{"text":"Crust has no flavor. It was like eating cardboard.  So disappointing!  Ordered for delivery. Wait time was 45 mins (typical in Anthem) and delivered on time.  Expensive for the quality level."}
{"text":"We ordered from here again to give it another try. It was better, but still not great. There was more flavor in everything this time around but it still lacked. The next day, we heated it up and it was still only ok. If I could give half stars, they would get a half star upgrade.

I have been to another location and the pizza is amazing so I know the potential this place has! Come on Arcadia location, make it happen!!!!"}
{"text":"Anthem must be a magnet of bad pizza places. Since its inception, almost 20 years ago, we still can't get good pizza here. For that matter, good restaurants period can't find their way here. Only Gyros and Shanghai are options for us, the rest can't pass basic requirements. 
Giant Rustic Pizza is no different. Yesterday we ordered two giant pizzas and they were no good. The kids were ok with the Malibu chicken, though nothing special and certainly not worth $21.95. Mine, a Berlusconi, was awful. I asked for extra sauce: there seemed no sauce at all on it. Of course I was charged, total $24.95. Supposed to be loaded with meat (pepperoni, sausage, salami), there was very little on it. Mostly cheese and very greasy, no flavor and a burnt crust. What a waste! Another bad pizza in Anthem. 
We will have to travel again for a good one. We know two places so far: Taste of Italy in Goodyear en Florencia in Ahwatukee. Both are great, well worth the drive. Special trips though, can't do them every week obviously. When will Anthem finally get a real pizza place? The wait continues.."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place and because it was so close to home I decided to try it. The pizza was very good, the wings came with sauce on the side which I thought was odd. They didn't seem too busy when I went to pick it up, almost like they were waiting for me to come so they could leave, it was ready pretty quick too, like 15 minutes or so (they said they discontinued delivery by 8:30, it was 8:35 or so when I called--- not a big deal I totally get it)  None of this bothered me again food was great. When I had called again on a Friday night there was no answer, it was 7:45pm or so, I tried calling multiple times.  Finally I went there and they we're closed! At 8pm on a Friday night! Stools up and everything. That was disappointing, I will try them again, hopefully I catch them before they bounce."}
{"text":"Great pizza place for lunch or dinner. We had a group of five (with three boys) and felt pretty satisfied with a giant pizza for $20. Next time we'll probably add wings though. We did half and half margarita and BBQ chicken. The margarita was good but the BBQ chicken was my favorite, it had great flavor with a hint of sweetness. The crust was tasty and one of the better ones that I have had. Service was great -- they were attentive and friendly. All in all a solid pizza place and one that we will probably frequent often for lunch!"}
{"text":"In Arizona this is as good as Pizza gets. I'm originally from New England and one of my favorite pizza places is an oven baked pizza from Papa Ginos. The reason that pizza resonates is that it always has a crispy bottom layer, fantastic dough, quality cheese and just enough sauce to support the dough and cheese. 

Giant Rustic Pizza has all of this. The mouth-feel when consuming the pizza is amazing. Often you will get to much dough, to much cheese, or some tart overdone sauce out here from the generic Pizza places, but this is all well balanced. If you order the 20 incher your eyes will pop out of your head how big the slices are. 

The customer service was amazing and friendly, they had the pizza ready on time and a smile when I came into their small shop. I kept thinking this is how a pizza place is supposed to be, and exactly how it is out east (minus the smile).

I would say throw away your coupons to Domino's and Pizza Hut and try a decent pizza for a change. Oh, and the pricing for a 20\" is $13, so it's very affordable."}
{"text":"Work right down the street and saw this place on ABC. Few co-workers and I gave it a shot and was thrilled at the size and taste of the slice. Crispy crust, great cheese, and they did not skimp on the toppings...only take-out and delivery but the staff was awesome and for the price you can't beat it. Looking forward to a second trip!"}
{"text":"Great service, HORRIBLE food. Tried 3 different dishes on menu while here and was thoroughly disappointed with them all.  They were so bad, I had to look up Yelp reviews to see what the consensus was and I'm surprised so many people enjoyed the food. Almost everything me and my girlfriend ordered was burned and we had to send her pizza back because it was just past the point of edible. Maybe you'll have better luck but I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, fast delivery, friendly employees! Great addition to Anthem! Our new \"go to\" pizza place! Some day, we may even make it to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm an east coast native.  I like my pizza with zesty sauce, plenty of cheese, and a thin, crisp crust.  Giant Rustic Pizza delivered on my first two requirements more than any other place I've tried in the Valley.
I will say I didn't love their crust--too thick, not quite crispy enough.  Still the flavors were better than any other pizza I've had here (enough so that they outweigh the less than stellar crust), so I think I've found my new pizzeria!
I will note that the large pizza was pretty small.  If we were hungrier, my husband and I could easily have polished off a whole pie at dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since it's right down the street......don't waste your money.
The Positive: it's edible & priced ok
The Negative:
- they don't offer the pasta at their Phoenix location but still have it on the menu
- they didn't have all the ingredients for their \"custom\" created pizzas
- their dough needs more seasoning or salt......it has no flavor at all. Anything made with the dough: pizza, garlic twists & puff bread had no flavor.
- our \"garlic\" knots were slightly burnt which they seem to be known for burning pizza & knots.
- they also claim to have \"flavored\" tea on their menu, but all they had was unsweetened & sweet similar to what you'd find at a fast food joint.......not to mention the ice maker was broken. 

Long story short....I know there are better pizza places around Phoenix and I'd skip this one."}
{"text":"We tried the new location in Anthem this past Friday.  Friends of ours that live out there told us about it, and we were excited to give it a try.

We went somewhat early to avoid the crowds/rush, and left impressed and wanting to come back.

We arrived, and were greeted by one of the owners, explained we were first timers, she was very friendly and welcoming, and made us feel right at home.  The young Lady that took our order was also friendly, patient, and helped walk us through the process since it was our first time.  

We ordered a large house salad, a regular order of garlic knots, and a 20\" cheese pizza.  The salads are in a cooler by the drink station, and are already made.  Since it was our first time, the young Lady that took our order grabbed it and the dressing for us while we grabbed a table and got ourselves situated.  

I was a little concerned that the salad was pre-made and waiting in a cooler, but this was not a problem.  While fairly basic with a romaine mix, some green bell pepper, tomato, and some cucumber; everything was fresh, crisp, and cold.  We chose the balsamic vinaigrette, and were happy with our choice.  The dressing had that nice balsamic flavor, but it wasn't overwhelming.

Next up was the garlic knots, and they were very good.  We ordered a regular size, and receive 6 hot, fresh, chewy knots with a good amount of garlic.  They didn't last long, GRP serves them with a side of marinara for dipping, which I thought was a nice touch.  One word of warning, be careful opening the container of sauce, it is very hot (it was also very good, and went well with the knots).

Then came the \"pizza de resistance\" (sorry, couldn't help myself).  My favorite meals are usually simple, well prepared foods with quality ingredients.  This pizza fit that requirement nicely.  The pizza came out and it looked and smelled wonderful.  We all dug in and yes, it tasted as good as it looked and smelled!  The menu states that GRP uses \"whole milk Wisconsin mozzarella hand shredded each day for freshness\"; one taste, and I believe it.  Fresh quality cheese stands out, and has a flavor/texture that \"pizza topping\" will never match.    The sauce was very low key, but was plentiful and complimented the cheese and crust nicely.  Oh, the crust...had the right amount of chewiness and the flavor that once again says quality ingredients matter.  The only negative about this pizza (in my very humble opinion) was that there was a little too much crust at the outside edge.  Luckily, the crust is light, tasty, and chewy the way it should be, so this doesn't really take anything away from a very good pizza.  The 3 of us devoured that 20' pizza, and only took home a little over 1/2 a slice!

We enjoyed our visit to the new GRP, and can't wait to return; as a matter of fact, my wife wanted to go there for Mother's Day, but they were closed for the holiday.  

4-4.5 stars.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The first thing that comes to mind when I want to describe this pizza joint is...WOW!!

This is a situation where the company name says it all.
The \"Giant\" pizza is a beast!

So a few things. There are a very places that deliver to my work, due to zip code zoning, etc. After some explanation to the manager/owner, they agreed to start delivering here. So BIG THANKS to you!!!

When we all watched our coworker walk up with these two ridiculously huge pizza boxes, we couldn't help but laugh our butts off in total shock!  And the best thing is, the pizza was amazing!
HUGE slices, and they even throw in little cups of red pepper and parmesan.
I also got the veggie sub, which was also delicious.
My wife ate half of it the next day for her lunch, and even she said it was the best veggie sub she has ever had!

I wish I didn't live so far away, or I would be a regular for sure!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty dang glorious. As inventor of the world phenomenon \"pizza Friday,\" Giant Rustic Pizza had been on our radar for a while to try out. It's right down the street from us and it promises giant pizza...what's not to like.

Well, the name does not lie. Giant is GIANT. The one minus star I had to give was the last time I ordered in, I clearly said we only wanted the 14 inch pie, not the huge 20 inch. Girl on the phone repeated, 14 inches...we received the house-sized pizza. Not a huge problem, because...I mean, it's a ton of pizza. What a \"problem\" to have.

I love GRP's large list of ingredients and toppings. Our most recent order had sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms and caramelized onions. Tasty-city! The crust is really the start here. It's *SO* good.

We also always get the California Dreamin' salad. Rolled up deli mozzarella slices, tomatoes, peppers, arti hearts, roasted red peppers and black olives make up a great salad for sharing. Oh, and the BREAD they serve with the salad! So delicious! (and worth it to top your carbs on carbs on carbs.)

Such a great option for take-out pizza!"}
{"text":"We went here based on the reviews - this is strictly a take out place with a few high tables outside and really uncomfortable bar stools.  They do not have a fountain drink machine, all there drinks are in cans or bottles including water,  They do not make there desserts in house and the cook did not know where they were made or where they get them from.  We had the 20 inch giant rustic cheese.  A little basil on top of the cheese pizza would have made a huge difference, they informed us later just ask for it and they can put basil on it.. The pizza was a bit salty most likely the sauce and the crust was just like NY pizza thin and crusty.  We ate some there while sitting on the very uncomfortable bar stools outside and took the rest home..It tastes good the next day heating up in the oven or the toaster oven not good at all in the microwave.  Overall pretty good pizza, much better than New York Pizza Department and better than Nick's.  The price is awesome. I would like to try their salads which are located in there little frig by the cashier and they said made fresh daily.  Huge slices and 1 is enough to fill you up.  This place is not owned by the owners of NYPD like a different reviewer mentioned, it is owned by the same owner out of Anthem who owns the Mexican restaurants.."}
{"text":"I am of the opinion that there is no great pizza in Scottsdale, having been raised in NY I like the NY style with the real mozzarella (aka greasy, messy and tasty).  Many reviewers refer to this place having NY style pizza and I respectfully disagree.  I mean no offense to anyone ... I realize I am in AZ now, and my wife says this may make me sound like a jerk!  

That said, this is the best pizza I have had in AZ, albeit far from NY style.  The crust is fantastic.  The toppings are a little sparse, but taste fresh.  I love their stringy red onions and flavorful mushrooms.  I have had a few sandwiches each with fresh ingredients and the bread is amazingly yummy.  The baked wings are also a stand out here.  I have only had delivery (many times), which is always fast and everything arrives hot and intact.  All in all, a very good pizza place for \"healthy\" rustic style pizza, sandwiches and baked wings."}
{"text":"I just visited this pizza shop for the first time and it surpassed all of my expectations. Being a frequent Dominoes eater, I forgot what real pizza was. I hadn't been there before, so naturally I asked a lot of questions. Shaun answered all of them and recommended multiple variations. He let me and my friend customize a giant pizza (20\") by allowing us to do half and half. 

They have a ton of great toppings that I couldn't choose between, so I ended up getting 5 on my half. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten. Jerald made our pizza and we were able to watch the entire time. When it was finished, he delivered it to the table and made sure we had everything we wanted. 

They have an awesome, welcoming dining area that features an open concept, and a massive pizza oven, comparable in size to a small apartment. This allows you to literally see every step of the process. I've never been to a pizza shop that is completely open like this. 

I'm a pretty big guy, weighing over 200 lbs and was completely stuffed after 2 slices.

This place is incredible. I know they have salads and wings, but can't comment on those items as I only had the pizza. Definitely worth a visit. I don't think I'll be ordering budget pizza anymore."}
{"text":"The BEST pizza ever. Period. Don't believe me try it! Several varieties to choose from. Honestly you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Value for money, great service and a good product. Small touches like the condiment basket and flowers on tables appealed to me.

A casual place with great potential.  Very good service and an overall good experience.

A great lunch special - 2 huge slices, and a drink (not even fountain drinks, the real deal!) for $4.95"}
{"text":"Place is great, nice hole in the wall feel with good pizza and friendly staff. Good lunch specials with pizza by the slice as well. Slices are huge!"}
{"text":"Thank you Lindsay for suggesting this hidden gem!  I never looked to my left when entering Fresh & Easy!  and there it was!
Super nice staff - excellent food!
RMacy"}
{"text":"Just average here.. not bad, not great.  Not sure I will go back though."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Giant Rustic Pizza! We live about 20 minutes away and we'll make the drive for their yummy pizza. Their slices are ooey gooey cheesy slices of heaven! They have a cool lunch special - 2 slices and a drink for about $6. They used to have a specialty slice of the day written on a board behind the register, but on my last visit the board was gone. I'm assuming they no longer offer specialty slices. Either way, its good stuff! Giant Rustic is nestled in between a waxing studio and a nail boutique. Friendly workers and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I've been here now several times and they have never disappointed.  From the Chipotle sandwich to pizza to wings - it has all been delicious.  The staff is super friendly too and the place is kept clean and neat.  I love that you can walk by and see into the kitchen area too.  Great place and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wish I would have read the reviews prior to ordering!  

I ordered a Margherita pizza and a salad for pick up and arrived well before the time they gave me for pick up so the pizza should have been piping hot.  It was luke warm at best and they gave me 1 dressing for the salad and no red pepper or parm as I had requested.  The salad was enough for two people but one little salad dressing container didn't cut it.  Back to the pizza.  It was really the most boring pizza I've ever had.  No flavor and the sauce was really watered down.  $34.00 for pizza with no meat on it and a salad!  Wouldn't mind the price if the pizza was good but I will pass on going back."}
{"text":"I can say without a doubt this was the worst pizza I have ever had in my life. It was so bland we thought there had been a mistake, however a woman sitting at the table  (outside) next to us had the same comment about her pizza. In addition the friends of the employees hanging around the kitchen area visiting does not leave a favorable impression. Our first and last visit."}
{"text":"Cute new local spot, close to home, and we were excited to try it.  Greeted by a lovely, bubbly little Italian woman, we had high hopes.  While the pizza is in fact giant in size, it's unfortunately not so big on flavor.  We ate a few bites and left.  The owners seemed like really nice people.  But their focus on size (the little Italian lady kept telling us that its the biggest pizza in the city by two inches) is short cited from our perspective.  While families on a budge might appreciate the size, those looking for a great pizza will go elsewhere.  The local competitors (Bianco, Pomo, and even LGO) are simply too good for this place to make it."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza since I have lived in Arizona. The giant pizza lives up to its name and can feed a family of 5. the cheese is great, the sauce has a tangy taste to it, and the dough is cooked perfectly in the oven. Never burnt, and has the right amount of doughy texture to it. I am surprised they haven't offered this yet, but they should offer oil and vinegar to dip the crust in once you finish the pizza."}
{"text":"We have a new favorite pizza place! We've only ordered from there once and got the daily special (14\" pizza & 12 wings). I thought the price was fine..$22.  The pizza was outstanding. Not too much sauce and sliced Italian sausage instead of crumbles. The wings were very good too but wished they offered a Garlic Parmesan sauce or something similar. My husband went to pick it up and said we're going there to eat next time because they have a gelato bar! Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Great pizza with homemade ingredients. This is primarily a pickup or delivery pizza place.  Very happy with Rustic."}
{"text":"Pro tip: If you sign up on their website for their newsletter, they'll send you a coupon for a free dessert. 

I've ordered pizza from here once (giant size, of course). Obviously for take out since there's barely any seating. I got half and half of two of the specialty kinds and thought the price was very reasonable. Love having pizza leftovers!! I got a salad once there for lunch, too, and it was really good. One of my friends raves about their sandwiches, but I haven't tried that yet (why haven't I???). 

Interesting little story: I wasn't sure which free dessert I should try, so I asked the two guys working there. They both told me they hadn't tried any of them which seems a little weird and definitely not very helpful. I ended up picking a s'mores cupcake that they only had one of since they said somebody who works there is somehow related to the bakery and their cookies are really good. The cupcake did end up being delicious, but mostly chocolate without too much marshmallow or graham cracker."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I was walking by the various shops and noticed Giant Rustic Pizza.  The pizza and sandwiches I could see people eating at their small tables outside made me want to come and try it.  Last night my wife and I stopped by there for supper.  Rather than get something to eat there, we decided instead to get their 20\" pizza.  They have a special deal on the menu for a 20\" with 5 toppings for a little under $20.  We chose sausage, artichoke hearts, olives, mushrooms and red peppers.  12 minutes later our massive pizza was ready for us to take home.

When our pizza was ready, they didn't just hand us to box with the pizza inside.  First, he opened the box to show us our pizza and confirm that it was what we ordered and to make sure we were happy.  This is a nice touch that I've never seen done at a pizza place before.

When we got home, we began eating the pizza.  It was awesome!  One of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.  The crust is awesome and has a bit of the wood-fired taste to it.  The toppings are very good.  My wife commented that the pizza isn't greasy like a lot of pizzas.  Anyway, this 20\" pizza has given us enough pizza to last the weekend.  It's a very good value.

I'd like to try their sandwiches sometime."}
{"text":"We ate there Friday night and it was an absolute delight.

Scott the owner, the staff and the décor was very inviting.

The pizza was very good. The combination of the tasty crust, the right amount of sauce and a fresh mozzarella along with quality toppings makes it the best pizza I've had in Arcadia area. It was even tasty the next day.

What I liked about it the most is that they're not trying to be a fancy place or going all snobby on the food as the Arcadia area restaurants do way too much.  They obviously just want to be a pizza parlor offering a good pizza, at a fair price and they seem to be doing a good job of it.

They also have BYOB, you can bring in your own bottle of wine or beer and drink it with your food. I don't why but I find this kind of cool

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Love the crust, the perfectly cooked toppings, you can tell they use high quality ingredients, and really care about delivering a great, consistent product. Our new favorite!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. The slices are huge. The house salad is super amazing. The creamy Italian dressing is yummy. The customer service is fabulous. They are so friendly and energetic! I will definitely be back for another salad and pizza. The interior is very woodsy and cool looking. I recommend this place if u live in the area and even if you don't since it is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"So I came here last week and did not have a good experience at all. I wrote a review about it and there manage responded with in minutes. He was veery apologetic and offer to make it right by offering me a free lunch to make up for it. I really appreciate you guys for making the situation right. This time I got the chipotle turkey saw and it was amazing.
Thank you agen"}
{"text":"Very disappointing pizza tonight. We had the giant jalapeño pineapple and pepperoni. Toppings very quite sparse, and cheese too was barely covering the pizza. The wings ordered were good. We had the citrus chipotle. Quite tasty. The funds paid for the giant pizza  should warrant a few more decos  on the pizza."}
{"text":"This is a tough one to review. The pizza was 4 stars. Garlic Knots were 4 stars. The customer service was 4.5 stars. The speed of delivery is where it gets tricky to rate....

Placed an order online and was given an approximate delivery time of 6:30pm. At close to 7pm, pizza still hadn't arrived(hey, it's a weekend, so give them some leniency). Called in and spoke to a helpful individual(name slips my mind) who stated that my address was outside their delivery area - I'm less than 5 miles from the store. My card had already been charged for the pizza, but the order never went to the store. Even though I was just outside their delivery area, they made my order and delivered it. Order arrived correctly and the food was good... albeit roughly an hour and a half after the original delivery time. 

Would I order from here again, sure. Would I trust the online order process, highly unlikely."}
{"text":"I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza to go and when I got home I instantly noticed a large strand of hair on my pizza. Some things I can forgive, but this I can't. The staff seemed friendly, but even the pizza doesn't taste very good so I can't really justify a higher rating. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing. Not only does this place have delicious food, but the staff goes out of their way to accommodate. I've ordered multiple pizzas for delivery and have always gotten prompt service and was already a fan, but this last experience was actually at their location in Scottsdale.

My mom and I decided to stop in for lunch and weren't sure what we were going to order. The girl at the register went out of her way explain their menu items and lunch specials and a guy from the back even came out to make sure we knew all our options.

Now of course the pizza and salads we got were tasty, but it was the fact that the guy came over to us, after noticing that there were smokers outside to check to see if we'd like the door closed so the smell didn't bother us. So considerate! Then shortly after, a couple came in to pick up their pizzas and the staff clarified that they had cut one of the pizzas into smaller cubes to make it easier for the children to eat. Pretty awesome that they'd do that.

Highly recommended, good job Giant Rustic Pizza! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered food online and when it was about time for it to be delivered, I call to see if they could add on a cheesecake before they left. Found out they weren't opening until 4pm. Even though the hours of operations say otherwise and did not say they were closed until then on Memorial Day. REALLY! Bad technique. We were ready to eat and NOTHING."}
{"text":"Tried twice to visit. First time, they were \"closed for renovations\". Second time, there was a notice of deficient lease. Be aware, they may be closed!"}
{"text":"Locally owned & operated here in the valley. Both Scottsdale & Phoenix location are awesome. Lunch deal is the best in town and pizza is wonderful. They can do pretty much whatever you want and everything on the menu is good! This location rocks because you can dine in or take out"}
{"text":"I really love the pizza here. All the components are just right. The crust is very tasty, bubbly and slightly chewy. The sauce isn't too sweet or zesty and they put a perfect amount on. The cheese isn't skimped on either. I usually don't care for pizza sausage, but their kind is sliced and very good. I love that I can have Gorgonzola cheese on my pie! It's my favorite!"}
{"text":"I awoke this morning with the desire to eat a well made Pizza.  Truly wanting something that didn't come off an assembly line or out of some cheap industrial oven.  Well my friends I ordered from this restaurant and was not disappointed the least.  I went for the Red,White and Green pizza and the Brooklyn.  Both pies were exactly what I wanted in flavor,crust,sauce and even looks.  Pizza done correct is pizza done correct! This place doesn't skemp on the ingredients nor do they think inside the box. I recommend you try this joint!"}
{"text":"Third or fourth best pizza in Anthem.

Went on a slow Monday night and took 45 min to get pizza. Wanted wings but they were out. Garlic knots were good but somewhat burnt.

The pizza was huge and very greasy (we did not have any of the typical greasy topping on it)

Staff was nice.

The sandwiches look good so may come back to try one."}
{"text":"Mind if I say, yummy yum yum? This has to be some of the best pizza ever. This place has been so kind to us every time we go there, the service is fantastic and the food is delicious. Not only that, the food is vegetarian friendly. Fantastic! 

So let's get down to their biggest pizza selection.... It fills up the entire back of a mini cooper. It's so big. We can't even fit the box in our fridge, the slices are the size of dinner plates. IT IS AMAZING. 

We will continue to keep coming back here for their awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Really like this place. I've been for lunch a couple of times and dinner on a couple of different occasions. Really like the texture of their crust. Got one of the giant 20's when my son had a friend over to stay the night, good amounts of meat and great flavor. It was a big hit. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have ordered from you ever since you opened the Arcadia location. The problem is that your food is inconsistent. I have had everything on the menu at one time or another. For the most part the food is great but like last nite I ordered two sandwiches. I couldn't even find the turkey on it. The bun was falling apart on top, there was approx. 1 tsp. Of slaw on it. I was disappointed. Didn't even finish it. About 3 other times the top buns were so hard I had to throw them out. I love this place but really, you need to be more consistent. Thank you."}
{"text":"The pizzza ordered had a really nice bubbled charred crust, the toppings of pepperoni and sausage were nicely flavored all in all worth checking out."}
{"text":"Just tried today for lunch. I'm a pizza purist, so all of those fly-by-night, fad pizza joints with their outlandish toppings and crazy flavors don't impress me. I want a good crust, balanced sauce and quality toppings - period!

Crust - This makes or breaks a pie, whether your a Chicago deep-dish lover, or Chicago thin-crust/square cut type of person or a New York afficionado. If the crust is wrong, it doesn't matter what's on the pie, you ain't gonna score any points. That being said, Giant Rustic reminds me of the street-side pizza joints in New York that are a dime a dozen, with several generations of families working in the back slinging out honest-to-God great pizza - no frills. It came out of the oven with a great crispness all the way through. The edges were big and puffy with a great crunch. 

Sauce - Perfect balance between sweet and savory. Not too heavy, not too light. 

Pepperoni - thin thin THIN sliced and mildly flavored. Big win. My other piece (I got the lunch special, 2 slices and a drink) was a simple cheese which was great in its simplicity. The cheese had a great melted texture that was music to my mouth.

All in all, it's a win.

Service was great, friendly, fast - everything you want for a business lunch spot. Loved the soft Italian guitar music playing in the background - apropos for the mob book I'm reading... 

The ONLY reason I docked them a star is how small the place is. There is counter space for MAYBE 5 people and a few tables outside. This place has the potential to be big things but they are totally out of space for it... unless one of the places on either side of them closes down."}
{"text":"The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because the crust wasn't as doughy as my fiance prefers. With that being said, who doesn't love and (lets be real here people) need a fresh hot slice of pepperoni pizza? Very flavorful dough. Nice and crispy crust. The meats on the Slaughterhouse Pizza are super yummy. The price is pretty good too because a slice of the giant pepperoni is just enough and at $3 (that's including tax) you can't beat it. The staff is courteous, and the ambiance is fitting for date night or if you're just grabbing a slice before heading home. The parking lot could be better but it isn't Giant Rustic Pizza's fault people drive and park like fools! Anyways, it's yummy and better than Pizza on 40th (which use to be mama mia's RIP). Enjoy pizza goers!"}
{"text":"I've been into Giant Rustic Pizza three times in the past two weeks now after discovering it.

This place is cheap and delicious. It hits all the right point for me in terms of a casual pizza eatery. It is fast, cheap, and legit. Not only is the pizza really good, their salads and sandwiches can hold their own. Also, I fully intend to go back there soon just to get their garlic cheese blossom. I don't know what they do to that thing (probably cocaine), but it's so fragglin' incredible, that I almost at an entire one and didn't even care I had no room left for the pizza we ordered with it.

I was introduced to this place by a buddy of mine. I had been going somewhere else close to my house for my local casual pizza, when I didn't want Bianco, Pomo, or the like. For the foreseeable future, I'll be taking a slightly longer drive for substantially better pizza. Thanks, GRP."}
{"text":"I live near this restaurant, and break my non-dairy diet rule just for their pizza.  On an occassional Saturday night.  They have flavorful pizzas.  Although I'm not a huge fan of pizza, this place works. 

Be forewarned, the following is a bratty rant:

I've deducted a star because they were unwilling to break one of their rules for me.    I wanted to try their pizookie. Some dessert prepped in a small cast iron skillet. However, I was told this dessert couldn't be packaged for travel.  What?  Why not?

Apparently it involves ice cream, and they are not equipped to package ice cream for delivery...I was also told the pizookie could not be transferred from the skillet into a to-go container. 
 
So let's see. Half baked cookie dough in a skillet, hot, with ice cream...hmmm. sounds familiar. Pretty sure I've received something similar via delivery in the past from elsewhere. 

Thanks Rustic."}
{"text":"Had the chicken caprese sandwich. Amazing! The bread, mozzarella, tomatoes, and chicken were very fresh."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Thr owners are seasoned professionals, but it is difficult to express how badly they missed the mark on this one. Maybe if they trained the staff and had descent food? This lauch is a complete mess. You order at the door (drinks and all) and then seat yourself at tables that are not wiped down between patrons. I actually watched a frustrated customer open a wine bottle for the incompetent girl behind the counter who admitted she didn't know what she was doing. The food is ok, but for the price ahould have better ingredients, flavor, texture and presentation.
It really is just poorly conceived and executed at every turn."}
{"text":"Really good pizza for a very reasonable price.  Very unique take on pizza, actually.  The staff is super friendly and helpful too.  A nice departure from the norm if you ask me. Tonight was our first, and we'll be back lots more!!!"}
{"text":"The husband and I stopped by here for a slice in mid December and I must say, it was alright. The slices are large and inexpensive. The crust was flavorful, but the slice was on the greasy side (and it was just cheese, so I can't imagine the grease factor if it had any kind of meat on it) and not very flavorful. Maybe their whole pies are better or maybe this was an off day, but I thought this was just a standard slice of pizza.... sort of like you might get in the mall food court. I would want to come back to try one of their specialty pizzas, which did look very good or possibly to order a whole pie."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! Giant is no exaggeration... and seriously, you cannot be the price! Great pizza, wonderful and friendly customer service and all around good  pizza!"}
{"text":"I give the pizza four stars and the customer service five stars.  My husband and I dined in and ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and basil.  The flavor is great, but the crust is a little thicker and the ratio between toppings and crust is not quite balanced.  I will say, the place is popular though.  During dinner there was a steady stream of people picking up pizzas.  

The employees are so nice and accommodating.  Our waitress always made sure we had full cups of water.  Also, I like the \"rustic\" walls and attention to detail in the decor."}
{"text":"Oh please come back Giant Rustic. We loved your pizza and your prices."}
{"text":"The only item ordered was a pizza to go.  Although the crust and toppings were fine, the underside of the crust had an excess of cornmeal, which made each bite a little gritty.  The manager/owner(?) who I chatted with was very nice, and except for the cornmeal everything else was fine.  However, for me, the cornmeal is a deal breaker.

Updated Sep 7 2013:
After a few more visits, I'm updating my rating from 3 to 4 stars; the cornmeal issue which I experienced on my first visit is no longer a problem.  One additional thing I noticed is that on the bottom of the pizza box, there's a piece of corrugated cardboard, which keeps the bottom of the pizza from sitting flat on the box and lets air circulate (keeping the crust crustier?).  Offering a thin crust option on the menu would be worth that fifth star!"}
{"text":"I get coupons in the mail... $13.95 for their giant pizza! The pizza is not only delicious, it's also big enough to feed me for a week. Great deal, love this place!"}
{"text":"I've ordered probably a dozen pizzas from Giant Rustic Pizza and have never been disappointed. The pies are always delivered hot and the portion sizes are truly \"giant\" with the 20\" pizza. This is a small business and sometimes get a tad overrun with orders which can take longer than your typical \"chain store\" pizza delivery. Be patient, the pizza and other dishes are worth the wait. Ordered tonight and it took slightly more than an hour, when they said about 45 minutes. The driver was courteous, explained what was happening at the store and provided a free dessert to apologize for the extra few minutes it took. Don't think that would be happening with Domino's or Pizza Hut. Malibu Chicken, Rustic Sonoma and Red-White and Green have all been really good and we'll keep ordering from them as a much better alternative than the usual pizza chain suspects."}
{"text":"Pizza has a great flavor, the garlic knots are fabulous and they have a wide selection of salads.  

I would give 5 but no beer or wine.....wish they would advertise BBYO better because you can bring your own in.  There used to be a Fresh and Easy next door but its gone so come prepared. 

Staff is super freindly."}
{"text":"My pie was just okay. Ordered by phone, and this was my first impression of Rustic Pizza, not good. It seemed the gal taking my order was just learning the fine art of listening, or didn't know the menu.

\"I'd like to place an order to go.\"
RP \"You'd like to order a pizza\"?

Uh, yea?

\" Yes, the Sweet and Spicy with Pepperoni, Pineapple and Jalapeños\"
RP \"Ham and Pineapple\"?

Uh, no?

\"Pepperoni, Pineapple and Jalapeño\"

RP \"You want a specialty pizza\"?

Uh, whatever?

So, I finally got through to her, and was told it'd be ready in 20min. Really? Wow, on a Saturday night? Cool, I thought. I now know why they ain't so busy...again, just okay.

The pie was ready when I arrived, full of pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeño, and the sauce was flavorful. Not a lot of cheese...I'm big on cheese, so no complaints here, I would have liked more, but that's me.

The crust is what killed it. I've had pizza with crust that I would eat plain, so I know its out there. If I don't want to eat the crust, the pizza becomes, well, just okay. It's certainly edible, but it needs to be more than that, heck, the crust is what carries the ingredients to my mouth and I want it to be a compliment, not just something that holds my pepperoni."}
{"text":"Decided to try it because they sent me a mailer for a free giant cheese pizza and I would pay full price for that pizza now. It was that good."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Same owners as original NYPD Pizza. I think Fired pie down the street is better."}
{"text":"I don't like pizza and I actually LOVE this pizza and since we live right up the street, I often negotiate with my husband to have this instead of Rissotti's."}
{"text":"Their pizza is really delicious made with the freshest of ingredients. It's the closest thing to New York style pizza I've tasted beside actually going to New York. The employees at Rustic pizza are very friendly and the environment is nice and open. The owners are Italian so you know they're the real deal. I would definitely recommend you try at least each pizza once. They allow you to purchase the pizza by the slice of a whole pizza is to big for you. Also if you into spicy stuff with you pizza they have wings and a spicy chipotle sauce you'll have to try."}
{"text":"we waited an hour for our pizza to be delivered, which i find kind of ridiculous, but on sunday night i'm sure a lot of people probably aren't interested in cooking (just like us), so whatever. not a huge deal, just kind of strange.

when we did finally get our pizza, it was luke warm and just sort've... meh. the toppings were fine; they use sliced sausage, which i prefer, but it didn't have much flavor. the crust was pretty sub par too. i love carbs--LOVE them--and i ALWAYS eat my crust, but i couldn't eat this crush :( when there wasn't sauce/cheese/toppings on it, its gross and dry and had no flavor. 

i'm sure plenty of people will like giant rustic pizza (the reviews say so, anyway), but i just wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"Follow up review ordered delivery again. Was disappointed that order online option didn't work on my iPad. 
Not particularly displeased, but not pleased. I called to order. The woman who answered was so efficient and professional (we all know phone orders suck).  Once again, minus the website issues, awesome. Great pizza once again. 


Also the cursive font on the menu is borderline illegible on Apple products.  Please use a more legible font."}
{"text":"In June I went to this establishment since I am always on the look out for good NY pizza. It was not a good experience at all. 

I found the person who was working the counter was not very friendly nor helpful. The slice I had was not very good. Good NY pizza has an oily based topping with high quality ingredients, Melted cheese and good quality tomato sauce. The crust was too thick, floury dry, and chewy and a bit burnt on the bottom. I do not like burnt crust. The pizza was not cooked on top, rawish and  the cheese was not melted fully. It did not taste very good at all. Normally I give two stars for not that great but the service was bad so I knocked it down to one. 

The bathrooms were really dirty too with no supplies. That is always a bad indication for me. 

It seems other people like this place but I was not impressed. However, I am super picky when it comes to NY pizza. if you advertise you have the best NY pizza in town it should be and it is not. Also, I at least want a half friendly server, non rude management and staff, and a clean bathroom to avoid illness."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a try after seeing it served New York style pizza. Pizza by the slice option allowed us to t et you pizza and split a sandwich. This ended up to be a great way to try different items. We got a slice of pepperoni pizza which were pretty good size slices similar to the size of a costco size slice and then ordered the Italian Bird. The bread on the sandwich was exceptional with a good mixture of spices, meats and seasoning. The sandwich was definitely the high point of the meal. You have to fold the slice like a true new yorker when eating the slice of pizza.

The place is located in the shopping plaza with the grind with a good portion of parking. The inside I dc the the restaurant is small bur nice and quaint. Liked the chalk board that listed the menu, was impressed by that. Will come back to try other items and also go to their North Scottsdale location which is closer to home."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Really good New York style. Stopped for lunch and bought a single slice for 2.99 (February 2018).

 It was a giant slice and thin crust that had a wondeful crunch bottom. I had extra pizza sauce and the sauce is light and very clean flavored and delicious.

 Just right. The staff is eager to please and nice."}
