{"text":"By far my favourite restaurant in Pickering. I find myself craving their food all the time! I usually go around once a month. It is a little bit expensive for the all you can eat dinner, but I have always left fed, full and happy! The servers are attentive and always checking in, but never in an annoying way. I just recently went to Makimono in Pickering and it just does not compare to Dragon Rolls."}
{"text":"Although the iPads are cool, there are useless if your food doesn't come. Their customer service is poor and unhelpful as well. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is just ok.  Price is ok.  Service, nope.  Décor is very good for Pickering.  
The waitress thought I was psychotic when I asked for regular (red top) soy sauce which they do not offer on the tables.  She didn't know what I was talking about, then said she would get me some, and returned with low sodium soy sauce and told me it was regular soy sauce.  It wasn't.  I hate being lied to, and why the heck doesn't a sushi restaurant have regular soy sauce??  I hope they get better service, because the ambiance is nice there."}
{"text":"Pretty standard AYCE sushi restaurant.  No more expensive or cheaper then the next place.  You can also order A la carte.  Service is pretty good. Quick and efficient.  Ambiance is clean and modern. Food is your standard sushi/ oriental fare. The one thing that knocked them down a star is the additional charge when substituting an item from their party trays.  Even if the item you wish to change is a lesser cost,  they will still charge a minimum of 2.00 per item.  Kinda a rip-off for customers."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi and more. Lots to choose from. You order on an iPad and it comes super fast and very hot. Pretty decent and affordable. Nice ambiance and very clean."}
{"text":"Came in again on December 27. Consistent with my previous review, service is very poor."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars because apparently my 5 star review must be a fake and was not counted towards the overall rating"}
{"text":"I like to go here when I want a wide selection of food items. I don't think they have the best sushi or sashimi but overall they have good food. I like the idea of the ipad, it's fun, kinda wish the bill could come out of it...but thats clearly asking for futuristic type things ;)"}
{"text":"This is possibly one of the best AYCE restaurant in the Pickering. As a matter of fact, it's one of the best in GTA. The sushi selection is pretty broad, and the quality is excellent. If you don't feel like sushi you can always have their Thai food. 

Overall fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"The quality of food is incredible, although they don't provide sashimi when we request it at dinner. Even though it is on the menu, hey refuse to serve it to us."}
{"text":"Absolute, utter, sheer and unmatched garbage. Food was bland the service was slow the fried milk burned out mouths to a crisp and even the fountain drinks were sub par. Never again."}
{"text":"Not really an authentic Japanese restaurant. More like one of those Asian fusion places offering dishes from Korea Thailand etc. As confused as their identity is the ayce is decent and the staff is quite efficient"}
{"text":"I feel like the quality has gone downhill.. tinnyyy  portion size for sashimi and amount of  'salmon' in the hand roll!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this hidden gem back in September. I live in an area where every other restaurant is all you can eat, but this place takes the cake so I don't mind driving 40 minutes for some awesome sushi! The variety is amazing! From sushi to curry...you get it all. I absolutely love the avocado salad, I could eat 10 orders of it. The decor is very chic, great place for a date, have a birthday party, night out with the girls, or just a nice dinner to catch up with an old friend. The first time I went there the service was super great! The second time it was alright. They were busy so I could totally understand. Definitely try this place out if you haven't been here and don't forget to try the avocado salad :)"}
{"text":"Great and tasty food....but often make mistakes when it comes to service....happened twice with me .they brought d wrong order on the table ....but I still recommend this place for amazing Japanese and Thai food."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to get sushi! Plus your order comes super fast and taste amazing!"}
{"text":"Was passing by and saw this restaurant. Decor looked nice so we decided to try it out for lunch. 

First thing I noticed was the waitress looked like she was from a zombie movie. Expressionless... service was okay but man, you could see she either had a bad day or that she hated her job. 

Food was okay but nothing fantastic. I ordered 3 rolls combo and everything was kinda drenched in soy sauce... I didn't really want sauce on my rolls but oh well no choice... soy sauce rolls for me! 

The food looked nothing like pictures on their menu, pretty ordinary stuff. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Service quick to be seated, as ipads used for ordering, the waiting for approval by supervisor annoying. Large group will end up driving server crazy, we found it to be over whelming. Food is ok. Certain things ie sushi and fried choices are fresh and somethings seem cooked just placed in heated dish to keep Warm. They serve Thai/Chinese/Japanese dishes. Give it a try! You may come back maybe on certain occasions."}
{"text":"My friend brought me to this restaurant.

They operate with iPads - you order with it! Although, it was very inconvenient that the servers had to come by to confirm the dishes you order. The other sushi places I've been to that uses iPads usually just lets the customer send in the order themselves. 

They have a lot of selections and variety of different dishes. There are even Chinese dishes and Thai dishes. Price is reasonable. I honestly really love this place for its Deep Fried Cheese Wontons. I find that many All-You-Can-Eat Sushi places don't usually have that.

Next time I am in Pickering I will definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service is terrible. Waited in line for over 10 mins and there were many free tables. They wouldn't take any of our dishes away so it piled up at the end. We asked if they could take them away and the waiter told us that he would bring us a cart later... We ended up putting the plates on an empty table."}
{"text":"While the sushi and  sashimi are of great quality  for AYCE,  we were a large group and you would  think that the  ipad  ordering system would facilitate  this but not so.  The serving staff brought our food to another  table and  cleard our order, so we had to re-order.  Then they took a long time to bring our food.  Then they started to  bring us our previous  order....
The food was good, ambiance  was good, but for our large  group the  service  was lacking."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hit. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place as every experience I've had has been positive. Ambiance...service... Food.... Price - I am a repeat customer.

Price is very reasonable in comparison to other ayce sushi spots.

Not only do they have Japanese but they also offer a decent selection of Chinese (general Tao chick, sesame chicken) and Thai dishes (variety of curries, pad Thai). Love that they have regular and specialty sushi rolls. Food options definitely abundant. Good quality dishes and perfect sizes portions.

Ordering system sets this place apart from many other sushi restaurants, as food orders are placed through an iPad..awesome for helping you track your orders and ensure no miscommunication between customer and server. I absolutely love this!! Service is extremely fast..  I've never been left waiting too long for food to arrive."}
{"text":"Best sushi place I have been to. I go to this location often and there have been a couple of occasions where the cook must be different cause food is burnt or drowned in sauce. However, most of the times it is perfect and it is the best sushi!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food. It's very clear that they invested a lot of money and time in aesthetics here (modern décor, decorative plates, elaborate food plating)- but their showiness of an all-you-can-eat iPad menu cannot make up for their clear failures. I will not be going back.

Throughout our meal, the staff was entirely engrossed in their own conversation up at the front desk. There we extended periods of time where we were just waiting for simple things because they were laughing and chatting amongst themselves for long periods of time. There was a delay between my entrée and my friend's by almost 20 minutes in the already slow service, making my food grow cold so as not to eat without her.

The food was simply -eh-. It's something I would expect out of a fast-food place. Nearly every thing was bland, even their miso soup. How?!

There are FAR better places in Durham to go, at a better price, too. Don't bother giving this place your business."}
{"text":"This remains our go-to place for Japanese locally.   Sure, they have a lot of non-Japanese stuff on the menu, but we just avoid most of it.  This place has the best beef tataki (although they misspell it as tartaki on the menu) of anywhere I have been.  They are also the only one that serves it with the proper ginger sauce.  I would suggest avoiding the beef teriyaki and the beef skewers as they tend to be very over cooked.  The sushi is pretty good, although I would never get the deep fried california roll again, it was disgusting.  My husband is big into sashimi and is very satisfied with what they offer.  I am more into the tempura and rolls, so we are both happy with what we get.  The price is a bit high, but then all the buffet and all you can eat places are around here, so they fall in line with the rest."}
{"text":"I went to Dragon Rolls after a sporting event with my fellow teammates looking forward to a good meal but was instead treated to one of the worst service I've ever experienced - long wait times for food and equally disastrous service.  We were not served any food at all beyond a few morsels at the beginning and after bringing it to the waiter's attention, she refused to let us speak to the manager. They even threatened to CALL THE COPS if we wanted to pursue this matter further and refuse to pay the full amount. I will never ever come back here!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite AYCE place in the area. I prefer Dragon Rolls over Makimono personally. I like the combination of sushi and thai items that they offer and the iPad ordering is nice and easy to use. I have my favourite food items that I order every time which include cheese wontons, chicken pad thai, beef tataki, Philadelphia roll, Green Dragon Roll, gyoza and general tao chicken.

Sometimes items you order do not make it to your table, but that usually only happens when they are busy. When I came on a Monday night it wasn't busy and everything we ordered, we received and quickly. Also came on a Monday for lunch and it was the same. The service was great."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better sushi restaurants in the area. Though the prices may be a little on the higher side than your typical sushi buffets, with the lunch buffet costing apprx. $16, the larger than average menu is sure to make up for any discrepancy in the price. Not only is there a large variety of hand rolled sushi, but even the lunch menu provides patrons with a rather expansive selection of warm foods to choose from. 

Highly recommend -  4/5"}
{"text":"First time here for Sunday lunch. Got seated quickly but had to ask three times for a glass of water. Some ordered dishes not received and asked for extra ginger (only had four little pieces for two people) which we never received. Food was so so. Also, extremely loud."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Pickering! Service at times can be slow at times, but sushi is always great and fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable and fast sushi buffet.  I love this trend of ordering by ipad. You get a glimpse of the food, and you can easily order more and more.

Our food was tasty and seemed very fresh.  The all important sashimi seemed very fresh indeed.  Service was attentive, the decor is very modern and tasteful, and it's overall a delight to find this kind of restaurant in Pickering."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place. It is super clean and the customer service is great! You choose an all-you-can-eat or the a la carte. The bathrooms are clean but the water was ICE COLD; hence the 4/5. it gets busy pretty quick so try to go early on a weekday for dinner if possible.

All-you-can-eat

Appetizer:
- Miso Soup was great. Love starting my meal off with this hot soothing soup. 
- Dynamite Roll was great. Loved it
- Cheese Wontons are so delicious. I would have loved a little more of that sweet sauce ... feel like it was too little. I maybe had 6 of those
- Pumpkin Tempura was not great. It tasted like Sweet Potato Tempura. Wish they had mushroom tempura. I've had it at other places and loved it. I also wish they had a \"Vegetable Tempura\" which tempura of mixed vegetables; hence the 4/5.

Entree:
Curry Vegetable Fried Rice was amazing. It smelled so incredibly delicious and it  was a smaller portion which I had two of. 

Dessert:
- Deep Fried Banana is small and so delicious. 
- Chocolate Custard Pudding was horrible. It tastes and looks like a hybrid of jello and pudding with chocolate syrup hence the 4/5."}
{"text":"I frequent the place often but our visit last night while satisfying had a few flat notes. 

Firstly, the Kung Pao chicken was served smothered in sauce.  I like the sauce but there was no need to drowned everything

Second, the pineapple chicken was stone cold.  Even on the re-heat the chicken was warm but the pineapple was very cold. 

Thirdly and this often the case here a plate of someone else's food arrived. Now once I might forgive but twice.  And please note, some wait staff are insistent that yes you ordered the item.  Thankfully, the iPad breaks any tie and the item was removed.  The reason why I mention this is that if you waste any food or ask to take it with you.  The customer is charged extra.  

Fourth, the dinner menu adds some extra items. My favourite are Korean short ribs. However, last night's serving was more fat than beef. 

So on the whole the meal was good but these issues dropped my rating. 

BTW.  I highly recommend the deep fried bananas and two orders of vanilla ice cream.  A nice way to end the meal."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place for some AYCE

Like the fact that you can order off an IPAD

The sushi is good
I like the mango topped sushi

The Thai and Asian food is a nice addition

I like the pan fried udon and the gyoza

Service can improve a bit but no AYCE place will you get 100% service"}
{"text":"Horrible. The servers will bring you one item at a time. For example, they will drop one beef skewer that looks like beef jerky off to your table and then 10 mins later they will bring two pieces of tempura. Ultimately, if you order ten items, it will take about 1 hour for you to get those ten items.

We had to tell them to stop bringing food because over an hour after we ordered, food was still slowly trickling in. And everything is in mini portions.

I really would not recommend this place. Not worth the money or the time."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my sister for the AYCE Lunch buffet. It wasn't busy at all, we came around 12:00 and there were only two tables occupied. 

Its very similar to the Spring Sushi, you order from an Ipad menu and your food is dropped off. The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL, this was my first time visiting I was really pleased that Pickering now has a decent AYCE. 

The menu is very similar to that of Spring Sushi it has a huge variety gives you your apps, sushi, thai dishes and dessert. The food was good, the sushi is good but not great (knocked off a stat for that). But hey for 14.99 it was fantastic. The plates that are served are in small portions which is great because you can order more, but at least you wont be wasting food.  The servers were great, picked up empty plates right away. 

I will be back here again if I am ever craving for sushi."}
{"text":"Great Selection.  Great Decor.  iPad Menu.  Food was excellent.  Service was very attentive.great selection of hand rolls.  Interesting selections not found in usual buffets.

Glad I found this place in the east end .. Would go again"}
{"text":"My mother and I stopped by here today for lunch. We ordered sushi, chicken pad Thai, and some vegetable and meat rice dishes. We found the all the food to be delicious, and was served promptly. We especially loved the chicken pad Thai, and I recommend it. 

The servers there were direct but friendly and quick, making the dining experience more enjoyable. They also have tablets that you order from, which can be a fun and convenient experience for some, but confusing for others. We personally liked it.

It was a little expensive, coming to $38 for the two of us. However, I have been charged much more for buffet lunches in the past, and the food quality really helped my overall impression. If I could, I would rate this restaurant 4.5/5."}
{"text":"We went for the all you-can-eat sushi dinner option. They had a good variety and our server was quite attentive at the start. Nearing the end however, it became a bit harder to get her attention - mind you the restaurant was about to close.

The food's quality was good for an all you can eat. I particularly enjoyed their specialty dragon roll shape like a dragon. But fair warning to those who order this, expect to wait 30 minutes to get this. It took the chefs 30 minutes to prepare this roll, but you can certainly see why when you see the presentation. For us, it was worth the wait as we had other options coming out to eat and fill the time. The roll itself was not only beautifully crafted but also excellent in taste."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! However, the service is awful, especially  during lunch time. The servers drop off plates as if they are passing by, with no eye contact or a word."}
{"text":"If you care more about quantity than quality then this is the place for you. Its one of those AYCE sushi joints that churns out rolls too fast to make it good. Also very overpriced for the quality. Two people for dinner cost about $50! Not as bad as mandarin sushi but not worth it."}
{"text":"Fish bones in salmon sashimi.....not a happy customer..

This used to be a great sushi place however the staff has gotten lazy and raw quality continues to decline.  This is the final straw for me..."}
{"text":"Awesome ATCE sushi, such a vast array of options, fresh and tasty!  Fast service and you can order as little or as much as you like. A perfect place to go in a group!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time five-staying an AYCE anything. Dragonrolls is pretty awesome though, even if its inital hook is the cheesy \"using an iPad to order\" thing. Lunch including a generous tip comes out to about $20, and the menu is expansive - it's got lots of sushi options, plus small plates of Thai, Chinese, and Japanese dishes, so lots of variety. I think it's probably the biggest lunch menu I've seen at one of these joints.

And the food was pretty decent. I'm wrecked for sushi after Zen in Scarborough, but still, not bad."}
{"text":"Usually when I have been here in the past it has been amazing but lately in the last couple of months this places sushi and service has been going down hill. Recently when I was here took them 25 minutes to bring our first order out and after it FINALLY came it was all cold and even after that our next order took forever and was still cold after speaking with the manager all she could say is that it was due to a shift change but how many cold dishes can you bring out even after just complaining the manager personally brought out our food and it was STILL COLD, so needless to say for the price u are paying you are better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant and the food was also good. The service was ok and they were visibly disappointed because we did not opt for the all you can eat menu. A little pricy, but overall a good place to go. I would had rated it higher if they had options for kids."}
{"text":"Staff: very kind and considerate, they sat us in a booth but there was a strong draft and it was pretty chilly and they moved us without hesitation

Ambiance: modern, relaxed, washroom is clean

Sushi: great! Fresh!

Cooked food: Mehhh, tasted better ones"}
{"text":"So we finally got a chance to try out their AYCE.  The sashimi was good but all the pieces were on a very small side.  There wasn't a huge variety of fish but what we ordered were ok.  

For the usual Japanese AYCE, I actually liked the fact that the DR had Thai dishes that offered a good change to the palate with curries and stir fries.  

The shrimp green curry we ordered was actually spicy with enough authentic Thai flavours to cleanse our sashimi-ed out palate.  

The restaurant offered one fresh scallop sashimi with purchase of AYCE when we dined.  Although the idea was novel, when it actually came presented with their suggested sauces, it was so yucky that we wiped the sauces off with our napkins and just ate the scallops.  

The AYCE dining experience was just an ok one.  Not sure if I would rush back there to partake on their offerings but I wouldn't rule it out altogether for any future invitations from family and friends."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi resturant in Pickering. 

Fast service, good space inside in a good location. Downfall is the parking that is a little limited if you come during a busier part of the day. 

The sushi is well made, not falling apart and they are good on accomdating big groups. Every time I'm there is with a group of 6 or more."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday.  My friends vowed that it is better than Makimono.

AYCE dinner at $24.99.

Service was slow.  Sashimi pièces were pathetic; thinly-sliced and given out sparingly.  If you ordered 10, they will cut 5 pièces into 10.

The photos on the IPad are not représentative of what they bring to your tables.  For example, a photo of 1 long grilled eggplant will actually look 4 (small) square pieces of eggplants.
Among others:  skewers/beef ribs/sashimis and rolls.

Did not take any pictures, too depressing to post ;(

Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It was actually really good ! I enjoyed it a lot I like that they have pad Thai !!!! I love their green dragon rolls and the fact that it's small because they use less rice unlike some sushi restaurants ! The only thing I didn't like is to get a drink it's extra ! Usually pops are included in the ayce restaurants but not here but mostly everything else was good !!!"}
{"text":"I got take out from here yesterday because my favourite Thai place is closed on Sundays. I had a really bad craving for pad thai so I decided to check this place out. It was rather disappointing. I ordered the vegetable pad thai with no egg & no tofu but asked for extra veggies in the dish, I also ordered a mango salad. The lady I placed my order with said that there would be no problem with that. I went to pick up my food & it was a little late but just by under 5 minutes so not a big deal. The restaurant it's self looks very pretty inside. I got my food home & dove in only to find next to no vegetable. Just a lot of noodles in sauce. Thank god I asked for extra peanuts to add to the dish! The noodles & sauce was nothing special at all. It was edible but that's about it. The mango salad I ordered was the same. Nothing special & the order was so so so small. Overall I will not be back. Maybe the other food is better but as for me I'm sticking my favourite place down the road."}
{"text":"iPad is cool and convenient, but it doesn't replace the quality of the food. Servers were nice, except there were multiple orders that were missed. We were in this place for over 2 hours and had to cancel some of the orders because the food took so long and our dessert came first."}
{"text":"Once in a while I get those AYCE sushi cravings, So to satisfy my latest craving my friend and I went to Dragon Rolls, Tuesday lunch. First glance I was shocked when I got to the parking lot, never knew the place existing despite passing the plaza a million times. 

Nice clean restaurant, urban decor. The ipad ordering system was a nice feature. Clean, lag free, easy to use system, no complaints there. The service was surprisingly fast as well, after making your selection the staff were quick to confirm your order to send off. 

The Food 
- Overall my friend and I enjoyed every bite. Everything tasted fresh, the fish wasn't too warm or cold, or smell fishy. The rice wasn't hard or too mushy. Its no high end Omakase grade food, I am confident I got imitation crab lol, but for AYCE definitely top of the list. Beats that place near Markham and Sheppard, and McNicoll and Finch, ... you know which places I am talking about. 

The best part was the variety. From various hand rolls, rolls, sashimi, grilled items, dumpings, to desserts. One unique dessert item was the fried milk cubes - good stuff with vanilla ice cream.

Overall I recommend Dragon Rolls for AYCE, and would definitely go back. Wouldn't really be my go to place for a serious sushi dinner but the place is best at what it does. For the price you get a good variety of good food. As I looked around, everyone was enjoying their meals, so cant beat that."}
{"text":"I havent had a good exerience at Dragon Rolls the 2 times that I came here. The service is always poor, and the quality of food is okay. The last time I was there, I had to flag down the waiters to refill my tea cup and had to eventually ask for \"hot\" tea, as they kept pouring me cold green tea. Also, I don't eat a ton of raw fish, so I usually order from the wok menu. All the beef was always dry, tough and very chewy and cold (very disappointing!). Also, it was odd that they kept storing customers' dirty dishes with left over food, right next to our table on the floor."}
{"text":"This place is a bit expensive but the food is totally worth the price... Also the manager came around and told us to try deep fried milk... It was so awesome... I strongly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I've been back here a few times since my initial visit since this seems to be the go-to place for my friends who still live in Pickering. They offer a few rolls here that you can't seem to get anywhere else.

I came on a very busy night and the service was ABYSMAL. I'm sorry, as an AYCE restaurant, if you can't hack it when its busy, you're failing. We were ignored by a bunch of waiters, took over 20 minutes to get beverages to the table and they ran out of some of our favourite dishes. Took over 20 minutes to pay and I swore off the place after that. 

However, since my friends like it so much, I gave it another try this week. Service is nothing to write home about and its gone downhill since I first came here. Servers really don't care at all about listening to you when you speak. They walk away before you're finished speaking and then forget anything you've asked for that's not been punched into the iPad. This isn't surprising though, as I noted in my previous review.

Food comes out pretty fast here and everything was good, but not great. Dragon roll was good, dynamite roll was boring. Cheese wontons are always good but the beef short ribs were BORING. Nothing done to them and they weren't very good. 

I just can't bring myself to like this place again. I was so turned off by the last time I came that I haven't returned and probably won't again. There are better sushi joints around that have friendly, attentive staff and better quality food. It's an okay place if you don't like Makimono (which is horrid now) but do yourself a favor, make the drive to whitby and go to Tatemono for quality food and better service every time."}
{"text":"At first glance, the restaurant seems very modern and the tablet menus are great. Unfortunately the servers are miserable and the tables & tablets for ordering are all very dirty. 
We were seated at a table that still had dishes and hadn't been wiped. I could understand if they were super busy but the place was half empty. 
The food however was very good. Smaller portions and cuts than I used to but still ok. 

I'd have given this a much higher eating if the servers weren't like robots and they could be bothered to give the tables a quick wipe."}
{"text":"Lots of different kinds of sushi and kitchen stuff. It's my joint whenever i hit up Pickering. They got to bring some better ayce sushi places like this to dt Toronto"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, always at off peak hours, and am still impressed.

While the Sushi pieces are actually on the smallish side, the quality and variety is great and the price/value work out well.
We focused on the Japanese menu items and everything was great.
Service was friendly and fast.
All in all a great find."}
{"text":"I love the presentation, and the idea of using an ipad! I get to see what I'm ordering and get a feel on what it could potentially taste like! Lol.. the quality is really good, I actually tried going about 3 days ago and there was a HUGE line up. I guess that's the proof, no? I like the quality of the sushi and everything else, it's flavorful as well which is a hit or miss in sushi places. The only bad that I have to say about them is.. They sometimes don't bring everything you asked for to the table.. But honestly, that's not a big deal.. I just re order it again and usually that does the trick.. although ideally I wish I wouldn't or *Shouldn't* have to do that.. They need to work on that.. Besides that.. I will keep coming back to this place when it comes to sushi.. Plus it is close to the area I am staying in!"}
{"text":"So yummy!  Food was quick and service was great.  This is our favourite Japanese place in Durham region."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and am a fan.  I like the ipad ordering system and the quality of the sushi was excellent.  The Pepper Tuna Tartare I could eat daily and they have a raw salmon dish in citrus that is incredible."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. The the staff were really friendly and our server was the most knowledgable server of all time. He knew every item on the menu by number, literally. It is refreshing to experience this kind of hospitality. 

Two stars because we asked the gentlemen clearing our table for the bill: though he was my our server he very embarrassedly said he couldn't speak English. It's not our fault and it wasn't his. I don't mind: I felt bad for embarrassing him with the question."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here for lunch today! The price is right considering it includes sashimi for lunch on a weekend! Most AYCE lunch spots are almost 20.00 with no sash so we were pretty excited about that! Overall the food tasted as u would expect and the resto itself is clean. Would definitely come back here again! The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the service. The food came out well but waiting for water refills and our bill took forever and it really wasn't that busy today."}
{"text":"Came in here on a late Saturday afternoon for a bite to eat. It's an All You Can Eat Restaurant which you order everything through an I Pad. However we weren't that hungry for AYCE so we opted for the a la carte menu.

The decor in here is very modern and sleek. The hostess let us select our own table and we chose a very spacious booth in front of sushi bar where they were making rolls fresh to order.

To drink we ordered green tea. I was expecting them to give us a pot of green tea however it arrived in tiny cute white cups. The tea was very good with a deep roasted matcha flavour.

From the menu we ordered a few things to share between the two of us

Gyoz 6pc - The flavour of the meat filling was good however I felt the gyoza wrapping could have been fried longer as it was very oily and not crispy

Beef Skewers 3pc - These were very tasty cooked to a perfect medium-well with a light teriyaki glaze 

Spicy Salmon Roll 6pc - Very fresh tasting with a slight bit of heat and crunchy tempura bits and I love that it was slightly cold

Chicken Pad Thai - Came out piping hot and very saucy. However I found the flavour of there pad thai to be far too sweet for my liking and too heavily sauced 

Overall I found there dishes to be hit or miss. Service here was also not up to par. Food came out fast however once all our dishes were delivered no one came back to check on us or even refill our drink. We kept having to flag waiters down and I also noticed that most of the wait staff really understood or could speak English."}
