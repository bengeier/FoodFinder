{"text":"there are two thing they are doing correctly, which is using fresh fish and nice quality rice. And these are the key quality for Japanese dish. will definitely come back. 

this is part of the food-court, so I wouldn't bring my first date here, but lots space for kids.  and the price are reasonable."}
{"text":"Home-style Japanese food for amazing value! 

Majority of dishes are under $10. My friend ordered the ramen and I had the unagi tamago rice (which came with a miso soup). We shared a 4-kind sashimi platter. Sashimi, especially the red snapper, was fresh, though I would not say is top-notch. However, for $5, it was a pleasant surprise to find the quality of the raw fish to be superior than many AYCE chains, or Chinese/Korean owned restaurants in Toronto. Though there wasn't as much unagi as I had hoped for,  it was delicious; the unagi sauce wasn't overpowering and blended nicely with the pan-fried egg and rice. The ramen was good and flavourful, but prepare to be disappointed if you compare it with Santouka or Kinton. The miso soup, however, is fabulous. It's made from scratch and I can tell right away the flavour has much more depth without blinding my taste buds with excessive sodium.

Lastly, the guy at the cash/behind the sushi bar is super friendly and down to earth. He even gave us a complimentary iced green tea. I will most definitely return when looking for cheap, authentic, and low-key Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Currently this is my favorite place to order take out from.  The quality and freshness is better than any sushi restaurant I ever went to Scarborough and Markham.  One thing I really like is they have some premade orders you can buy right away without having to wait for them to make, plus I rate this place 5 stars is mainly b/c their premade sushi are still fresher than any custom order/instant made ones from other Japanese restaurants around my area."}
{"text":"The have moved again a week ago to the food court inside Metro Square next to IBM on Steeles in Markham. They serve dinner too.

The sashimi was very fresh and the price was good. It's like fine dining quality with street eats price. We were very satisfied and will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Their seafood is the freshest I've ever had in Toronto and the price is so good. After you try the miso soup, you won't have it in other restaurants. The owner is Japanese and he likes to do things the traditional way. You may have to wait a little while but it's totally worth it. They are the best."}
{"text":"The address is incorrect. I spent half an hr looking for a nonexistent place. Tried calling them, but no one picked up."}
{"text":"We went there this afternoon based on yelps review,so glad we did!

Impressed by the variety of fishes they offer as being a food-court fast-food restaurant.

Miso-soup is as good as other two reviewers descriptions!

My favorite is mackerel sushi! Big portion but right for each piece,so satisfied!

Sashimi is decent for me,but my partner likes them a lot!

The combination set is my another fav,since it's hard to find such interesting set from other take-out type of restaurant.

Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was super impressed with the quality of their fish given that this is food court sushi.  Much better quality than many restaurants that I've been to.  We ordered the 6 kinds of sashimi platter and a dragon roll.  Was so hungry I forgot to take pictures before I ate it but the presentation was also very impressive.  One of the fanciest dragon rolls I've eaten.  Big pieces of eel.  There was mackerel in the sashimi platter and I am usually not a fan as I find it tastes really fishy.  It actually didn't taste that way at all here.  I couldn't believe it actually was sweet and very yummy.  

I never eat food court sushi but tried it based on yelp reviews.  Glad I did and now upset at all the times I ate at Metro Square food court and didn't eat the sushi!"}
{"text":"I live right by here, and it offers the best selection of high quality fresh seafood you can find anywhere in the area. There are sometimes specials which make the fish very affordable.

Yes, there is toro here. Though it is sold in $40-60 steaks, I'm sure the owner could probably cut a chunk out, an extremely nice guy."}
{"text":"I custom ordered some sushi by pieces yesterday for lunch.   Price is very affordable and you get to pick your favorite sushi by piece.  I think fish cut too thin, and too much rice.  Also I guess they try to stuff 10 pieces of sushi and 6 pcs of spicy shrimp roll into a box,  the appearance is not too attractive.     They also made a few mistakes on my order, that makes me disappointed.  If you are looking for good value but can give up the quality, this is not bad for a sushi place inside a food court."}
{"text":"The name Sakana-Ya is not on the seafood section of the store anymore, although I did notice that one product in the section did bear the name Sakana-ya. They still have a variety of Japanese food product imports, but when I went a few weeks ago, they had a significantly smaller amount of fresh seafood than they once had. They also had fewer sashimi and sushi options prepared. I did manage to snag a package of cubed, raw, sashimi grade tuna, and a package of chopped up big eye tuna, also raw and sashimi grade. Both were under $5 each, and both I'd consider quite a good deal. I ended up going home and making poke with them. It was fresh and delicious. They also had a very reasonably priced raw hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), but as it was imported from Japan, my mother was apprehensive about it and we did not buy it. Something about radiation...

If I'm ever in the area, I wouldn't mind stopping by, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again. So sad. I've been tracking Sakana-ya since they were in J-Town. I hope they re-establish themselves as their own independent business sometime soon. I liked them much better that way."}
{"text":"Fresh fish. Great prices. This place is amazing. Like many others, I'm a fan follower. I tracked them from J-town to Chef Depot and now to Metro Square. Went the day it opened. Great stuff. They have fish you won't most Japanese restaurants (monkfish liver? haven't tried it yet. Abalone? so good). 

Will echo the comment about the miso soup. It's incredible. I believe they add fish bones to it to flavor it. 

And also commenting on the chirashi. The assortment of fish on there is great! Sea urchin? How often does that happen? And their sea urchin is delicious. Sweet and creamy the way it should be.

Owner is incredible. Have you ever been to a Chinese food court and received fantastic service? When we left, the owner came out, bowed, and thanked us for our service! Wish I lived closer so I could come more often."}
{"text":"Delicious, plentiful and authentic Japanese bento food. This is not your typical Toronto faux-japanese cuisine that is served by Koreans. The man in this food court stall was super nice as well. Incredibly well priced for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is an easy 3.5 + .5 stars, and I didn't even have the miso soup or any of the more \"exotic\" fish yet. Maybe if I give it one more try and it meets what the other 3 reviewers are saying, this could potentially be 5 stars. I'll definitely do an update once I have the opportunity to try here again.

I only ordered No# 210, 3 kinds sashimi. Nothing too exotic as I wasn't too hungry. The 3 kinds that came were salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. I definitely found the fish to be fresh, to the point I was surprised this is coming from a fast food joint. For $8.88 tax included, the price is absolutely reasonable, and might even be on the low side in my opinion considering you get 12 pieces out of it.

One small nitpick which took away the initial .5 stars is that I wish the menu boards were better laid out for the sashimi. I shouldn't have to look at the table to see the menu, as many people don't know the significance of this place. Perhaps invest in some display/menu boards? I mean, the food is so good that I really want this place to survive in the long run (we know how long Spicy Korea lasted...).

Mmm. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and Japanese food for the price.
Fish is mostly fresh (except for the sea urchins which sometimes aren't as fresh as they could be). Miso soup is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sakana-Ya might sounds familar?

Do you remember that little seafood area inside J-Town that sells Sashimi Grade fish, Uni in Package or you can order a whole platter to go?

Now Sakana-Ya has moved inside The Chef's Depot. If you are into sashimi, you will find Tuna, Hamachi, Salmon and even unopened Uni from BC! If you into fresh abalone, you will find it here too!

There are also tanks of fresh seafood! But since The Chef's Depot is still preparing for their grand opening on October 7, the selection is quite limited.

The downside though, one might need to pay a membership to The Chef's Depot for the privileges to shop here!! So come by now to take advantage of the free one year trial membership and worry about that next year!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star

Sakana-Ya found a new home inside the food court of Metro Square and hopefully they won't be moving for awhile. 

This location is way better than being inside The Chef's Dept on Markham Road. Being close to Jtown has its advantage as it is much more accessible to their loyal customers!

I love how they have sample display of the different combo they offers. At first I was a little worried that my sushi/sashimi donburi were premade like Sushi Q, but that not the case. Once you placed your order and get a number, the sushi \"chef\" will be cutting and prepping your order at a little sushi bar on the right of their takeout counter.

Sashimi Donburi with 7 kind of fish and Uni ($8.88) was A-OK. Healthy, Light and Delicious! perfect as a snack! Just mix everything in with the soy sauce! Special mention is the soup: A miso based soup with fish and fresh vegetables. 

If you love fish, you will enjoy Sakana-Ya offers! 

The set up reminds me of fish market in Japan! The fish here might not be of the best quality as this price point but different a lot better than most of the AYCE Japanese-Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is the place you can get the most freshness sashimi in an affordable price,  where you can find it in a foodcourt! Sea urchin sashmi in foodcourt? Yummm....but their freshness change sometimes so depend on the season i guess.  Other than that, sushi and sashimi were really good and fresh with lots of variety,  not just salmon but other fishes as well.   The bento box were nicely arranged with rice, grilled fishes or cutlet pork/chicken and side dishes.  Their side dishes change everyday, and it looked like those bento box you find in a supermarket in Tokyo,  this is their culture I guess,  more authentic thanother bento box in a japanese restaurant!  It does remind me alot of memories in Tokyo trip,  where you can buy those bento boxes in 7-eleven.  THeir beef don were good as well but it doesnt have much sauce in it.  I come here for lunch alot so its a good place to got your  take out!!!"}
