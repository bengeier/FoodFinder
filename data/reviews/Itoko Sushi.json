{"text":"I still love this sushi house.  We visit a couple times a month over the last three-ish years and it's still awesome.  I can't believe we're lucky enough to have great sushi in our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Friendly staff!! Good ambience!! Good sushi resto in community! I've been once in this place!! Too many food place to visit but i'll come back again!"}
{"text":"Consistently high quality sushi. I live in the neighbourhood and have dined here often. The sushi is always fresh, the cuts are generous, and prices are very reasonable. My family enjoys the yakisoba and tempura dishes and have always been happy with the meals. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We get Sushi from here at least 3-4 times a month. Occasionally we'll dine in, but for the most part we just stop in and pick up an order on the way home. Some of our favorites are the Shrimp Tempura, Salmon Pizza, Veggie Yam Roll,  Green Dragon Roll (eel), and Salmon Mango Roll. We also love the Sashimi Deluxe which is very fresh! Portion sizes are great and we always enjoy the it. We brought two family members from out of town with us once and they really enjoyed it as well and said the yam roll was one of the best they ever had!"}
{"text":"I went here today, because I really didn't feel like driving far to get some Japanese food. I haven't been here, until today's visit and was pleasantly surprised.
It's located in a strip mall, at the north end and a liquor Depot is located adjacent. It's also behind the Esso gas station in Lake Chapparel.
The location itself I believe is a converted pub/sports bar which closed. It's obvious by looking at all the existing televisions in the establishment not reminiscent to a Japanese sushi/restaurant.
My family and I were pleasantly surprised at how inexpensive most things on the menu were. I find when things appear inexpensive, you tend to order more and as a result find the bill a little on the expensive side. (For lunch that is).
We started with a shared appetizer of ginger beef. Not very Japanese, but tasty none the less. We also ordered the beef yakisoba, mango roll, yam tempura, beef yakitori, a bowl of rice, and also a California roll and 4 pieces of Tamago sushi. All of this with green tea for four people came to around $53.00 including tip.
The girl that was waiting on us was very nice, and also good with our children. I know people who have kids, like when wait staff are especially attentive to your kids.
This lunch time was not at all busy. Only one other table was being occupied when we arrived. There was one othe table, a party of 4 that was seated prior to our departure.
They must have been regulars, as the waitress asked where the dad was who showed up a couple minutes later.

I like this place and will definitley come back. The only thing lacking on the menu, may be the fact they haven't got any Ramen noodle dishes. They do have udon noodles though."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi. Lots of options available for rolls and cones. Udon soups are yummy. The decor doesn't do it justice from the outside but inside is pleasant and inviting. The staff is friendly as well"}
{"text":"Even though this restaurant is very close to me if I want sushi I am going to head over to Kinjo which is still close but not as close as Itoko. 
I do not like the environment. It is not as friendly and lively as Kinjo is and it is the exact same stuff as Kinjo but more expensive. Also at Kinjo you get a free Pocky with your meal and not at Itoko so why would I go here?"}
{"text":"Nice little place with good service. Very consistant."}
{"text":"When I arrived home from vacation sick and hungry and noticed that there was nothing in the house I found the closest place that would deliver lunch. Good thing for me Itoko Sushi is in the next community.

I had never been there before so ordered a selection of rolls and an assorted tempura all of which were tasty. I was surprised at how fresh the rice was especially considering it was take-out/delivery. 

I will definitely try other things from this place in the future. All in all it was a good find."}
{"text":"Itoko Sushi opened its doors just a couple months ago (May 2012), so they're still new!!  Itoko Sushi is located in Chaparral Drive in the SE of Calgary.  It's tucked away in a corner of the 'strip mall' in the same area as the Tim Hortons and the Mac's.
 
Spence and I have been meaning to try this new sushi place out but we've been hesitant because we already have a favorite sushi place and we didn't think anything would measure up (service, quality, and atmosphere-wise).  His parents live close by so after we dropped some stuff off; we decided to try Itoko Sushi.  Pulling up, there is a shared parking so you're sure to find a spot even if it's not right at Itoko's doors.
 
It was about 6:30PM when we pulled up; there was a lot of parking so we got a spot up close.  Right when you walk in, you can see the prep area. We were then greeted from afar (they were standing at the till).  We were the only customers there so we found the space to be very open.  We were told we can pick anywhere to sit so we decided to sit at a booth.  The booths are huge!  I think they can fit ~6 people!  We were handed a takeout menu to order from...and then we asked Courtney (our waitress) for suggestions and she suggested the most popular rolls and her favorite rolls.  We got some tea and water for beverages and then decided to go with a miso soup to start ($1.50), 4 Salmon sushi ($1.65 ea.), 2 Tuna sushi ($1.65 ea.), Spicy salmon roll (4 pcs, $2.75), Philadelphia roll (4 pcs, $2.95), Crispy spicy dynamite rolls (8 pcs, $7.55) and the Salmon mango rolls ($10.95).

The food came out in a timely manner and everything looked great.  I dove right into the salmon sushi which was yummy!  The pieces of sashimi were thick, nicely cut over the sticky rice and seemed pretty fresh!  Courtney suggested two different rolls: Salmon mango rolls and the Crispy spicy dynamite rolls (which are deep fried).  At first I thought to myself \"Deep fried sushi??!....weird\" but then when we got it, it was AWESOME!!  The crispy dynamite rolls (shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber) were very lightly battered but noticeable and it adds a nice crisp to the rolls.  When I put the roll in my mouth, it kind of mushed together and melted in your mouth.  The Salmon mango rolls (shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, salmon, mango, mango sauce, tobiko) were good, I like sweet and savory rolls and I wished that the mango sauce was a little stronger, otherwise, it was good.  For the Philadelphia roll (smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado) it was awesome!  I love the cream cheese in the sushi...gives it a nice taste and texture.  Lastly, the Spicy salmon roll (salmon, cucumber, spicy sauce) were great...not too spicy but just enough.  Oh! I almost forgot to mention we got some complimentary tempura yam and tempura avocado!  They just came by and gave it to us to try.  It was nice, crispy and tasty!! :)

Overall, our experience at Itoko Sushi was fantastic!  The service was great.  The food was awesome and it left me wanting to go back again ASAP!!  Not to mention the prices are pretttty good for what you get.   It looks like Spence and I have a new found love for another sushi place..."}
{"text":"It's been nine months! I've sacrificed, erring huge in the side of caution during my pregnancy. Got home from the hospital march 11th and over the next two weeks we ate delivery from our local (yeah!) sushi house three times! Thus far we haven't are in the restaurant but darn the food that arrived at our door was every bit as quality as in a restaurant. The rice in the rolls was fresh and moist. There is a variety. The sashimi is tasty and the portions of meat to rice is perfect!
The delivery driver was also courteous, funny and professional. I'm pretty particular so for me to eat anywhere repeatedly says a lot!"}
