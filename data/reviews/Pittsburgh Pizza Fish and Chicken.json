{"text":"We order from here a lot. Very consistent and good. I really like the Italian meals. Although, they stopped putting mozzarella on top of the meals, which I liked. Never had a problem with delivery or pickup. It won't knock your socks off, but it is good and cheap and quick. Pizza is good too. So are the hoagies."}
{"text":"Not to give you TMI or anything, but I'm currently on the toilet whilst writing this review. Do not order from here, their food is giving me loose bowel movement and an upset stomach. I'm pretty scared because I've never had this kind of food poisoning from any food, so I really hope it isn't too bad.

Anyways, after having read the reviews on this place, I decided to give it a try. I was especially interested in it because of its affordability (it has some really great deals). The pizza was delivered to me about 35 minutes after I ordered it, and the nice man on the phone also gave me a free cup of ranch for some chicken wings I ordered. I'm pretty disappointed because first of all, on the website, it says garlic parmesan wings. My wings had no parmesan, just garlic, and the wings were drenched in oil. Second of all, I ordered a diet pepsi and they gave me a regular. I'm not one to really nitpick at either of these things, but seeing as I am having a terrible aftermath, I felt the urge to write about them. Reviews on the actual food though is that the pizza is pretty dry. The cheese is extremely thin and the pizza sauce is nearly non existent. As a pizza lover, let me tell you, I was pretty disappointed. The wings were a fair size and were seasoned pretty generously, but just like I said earlier, they were drenched in oil. Those two and the pepsi and ranch were the only things I ordered but after seeing that my stomach was so quick to react 20 minutes after eating the food, I'm never ordering here again. 

Please be careful!!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Etna I have been searching for a standard delivery entity to bring forth local pizzas, burgers, and Italian food. PPG started off a little rough, but over the past year they've improved their quality of service to the point where they've become my go to for a delivery weekend pizza and/or chicken Alfredo.

Delivery is fast, they support online ordering (and for the most part pay attention to special notes or comments left to get the food changed just how I like it), the delivery drivers have always been polite, and the price per item is fairly excellent.

My favorites would have to be their Square Cut Pizza and their chicken Alfredo. The Bacon Cheeseburger with fries, Steak wrap, and quesadillas also deserve mention as they're are quite enjoyable.

Sometimes, when I'm feeling excessive I'll order a small party tray of sandwiches for a couple of people. The sandwiches are tasty, freshly made and utterly delicious. And those that aren't eaten immediately last in the fridge quite nicely for a couple of days afterwards."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Huge wings! Pretty good Gyro too. I was having a beer across the street at the Dancing Gnome and they delivered our food right to our table at the brewery (which doesn't serve food but let's you bring it in). The owner is a really nice guy and fun to talk with too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by while we were exploring the area while visiting a friend... Couldn't have asked for a better experience! Initially I was bummed since they don't have Italian hoagies and made due with ordering a cheeseburger, and oh man did I make a great choice! The burger was huge and tasted amazing and their fries are some of the best I've had. My boyfriend also got the chicken tenders and they were perfect. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Just had the gyro delivered.  Pass on this.  The \"gyro\" meat is the pre-sliced slab variety, slightly warmed over, and the Tzatziki sauce is a closer approximation to sour cream with specks of diced cucumber.  The onion, tomato, and lettuce were alright, along with the pita.  Definitely not worth it though."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  I called for a delivery order, and an hour later, it still had not arrived.  I called back to find out what time the order would be arriving, and I was told that the delivery driver had been out and came back stating no one was here.  Um, yeah.  From the conversation between the employees (one answering the phone didn't cover the receiver, so I heard the entire conversation), it was apparent that the order was not going to be redelivered.  If a place can't be bothered to call and find out information (even though the information was given to them when the order was placed), it's obvious they don't need the business.  That was my first time in trying the place, and there certainly won't be a second.  

Tip:  Spend your money somewhere else, because these owners don't seem to care."}
{"text":"good luck that food sucked too many onions, sharpsburg style ranch watered down, yee gads"}
{"text":"Solid pizza.  Efficient, polite and quick delivery.  I really like that I was able to order on the shop's website and it was delivered within 20 minutes or so.  I had the \"Special\" pizza (minus the sausage and pepperoni) and it was really quite good. The onions and kalamatas tasted fresh and the sauce had a nice flavor to it (meaning that it wasn't overloaded with oregano.)  The pizza wasn't too greasy and was appropriately thin.  Almost as important, I ordered meatballs for my three little Boston Terriers and they were over the moon about them!  They also enjoyed the pizza crust that I gave them. When I order next time, I'll probably try one of the gourmet pizzas."}
